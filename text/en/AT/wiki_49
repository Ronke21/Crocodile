<text>A delta wing is a wing shaped in the form of a triangle. It is named for its similarity in shape to the Greek uppercase letter delta (Δ).

Although long studied, the delta wing did not find significant practical applications until the Jet Age, when it proved suitable for high-speed subsonic and supersonic flight. At the other end of the speed scale, the Rogallo flexible wing proved a practical design for the hang glider and other ultralight aircraft. The delta wing form has unique aerodynamic characteristics and structural advantages. Many design variations have evolved over the years, with and without additional stabilising surfaces.

==General characteristics==
===Structure===
The long root chord of the delta wing and minimal area outboard make it structurally efficient. It can be built stronger, stiffer and at the same time lighter than a swept wing of equivalent aspect ratio and lifting capability. Because of this it is easy and relatively inexpensive to build—a substantial factor in the success of the MiG-21 and Mirage aircraft series.

Its long root chord also allows a deeper structure for a given aerofoil section. This both enhances its weight-saving characteristic and provides greater internal volume for fuel and other items, without a significant increase in drag. However, on supersonic designs the opportunity is often taken to use a thinner aerofoil instead, in order to actually reduce drag.

===Aerodynamics===

====Low-speed flight and vortex lift====
Like any wing, at low speeds a delta wing requires a high angle of attack to maintain lift. At a sufficiently high angle the wing exhibits flow separation, together with an associated high drag.

Ordinarily, this flow separation leads to a loss of lift known as the stall. However, for a sharply-swept delta wing, as air spills up round the leading edge it flows inwards to generate a characteristic vortex pattern over the upper surface. The lower extremity of this vortex remains attached to the surface and also accelerates the airflow, maintaining lift. For intermediate sweep angles, a retractable &quot;moustache&quot; or fixed leading-edge root extension (LERX) may be added to encourage and stabilise vortex formation. The ogee or &quot;wineglass&quot; double-curve, seen for example on Concorde, incorporates this forward extension into the profile of the wing.

In this condition, the centre of lift approximates to the centre of the area covered by the vortex.

====Subsonic flight====
In the subsonic regime, the behaviour of a delta wing is generally similar to that of a swept wing. A characteristic sideways element to the airflow develops. In this condition, lift is maximised along the leading edge of the wing, where the air is turned most sharply to follow its contours. Especially for a slender delta, the centre of lift approximates to halfway back along the leading edge.

The sideways effect also leads to an overall reduction in lift and in some circumstances can also lead to an increase in drag. It may be countered through the use of leading-edge slots, wing fences and related devices.

====Transonic and low-supersonic flight====

With a large enough angle of rearward sweep, in the transonic to low supersonic speed range the wing&#x27;s leading edge remains behind the shock wave boundary or shock cone created by the leading edge root.

This allows air below the leading edge to flow out, up and around it, then back inwards creating a sideways flow pattern similar to subsonic flow. The lift distribution and other aerodynamic characteristics are strongly influenced by this sideways flow.

The rearward sweep angle lowers the airspeed normal to the leading edge of the wing, thereby allowing the aircraft to fly at high subsonic, transonic, or supersonic speed, while the subsonic lifting characteristics of the airflow over the wing are maintained.

Within this flight regime, drooping the leading edge within the shock cone increases lift, but not drag to any significant extent. Such conical leading edge droop was introduced on the production Convair F-102A Delta Dagger at the same time that the prototype design was reworked to include area-ruling. It also appeared on Convair&#x27;s next two deltas, the F-106 Delta Dart and B-58 Hustler.

====High-speed supersonic waveriding====
At high supersonic speeds, the shock cone from the leading edge root angles further back to lie along the wing surface behind the leading edge. It is no longer possible for the sideways flow to occur and the aerodynamic characteristics change considerably. It is in this flight regime that the waverider design, as used on the North American XB-70 Valkyrie, becomes practicable. Here, a shock body beneath the wing creates an attached shockwave and the high pressure associated with the wave provides significant lift without increasing drag.

==Design variations==

Variants of the delta wing plan offer improvements to the basic configuration.

Cropped delta – tip is cut off. This helps maintain lift outboard and reduce wingtip flow separation (stalling) at high angles of attack. Most deltas are cropped to at least some degree.

In the compound delta, double delta or cranked arrow, the leading edge is not straight. Typically the inboard section has increased sweepback, creating a controlled high-lift vortex without the need for a foreplane. Examples include the Saab Draken fighter, the experimental General Dynamics F-16XL, and the Hawker Siddeley HS. 138 VTOL concept. The ogee delta (or ogival delta) used on the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner is similar, but with the two sections and cropped wingtip merged into a smooth ogee curve.

Tailed delta – adds a conventional tailplane (with horizontal tail surfaces), to improve handling. Common on Soviet types such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21.

Canard delta – Many modern fighter aircraft, such as the JAS 39 Gripen, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Dassault Rafale use a combination of canard foreplanes and a delta wing.

===Tailless delta===

Like other tailless aircraft, the tailless delta wing is not suited to high wing loadings and requires a large wing area for a given aircraft weight. The most efficient aerofoils are unstable in pitch and the tailless type must use a less efficient design and therefore a bigger wing. Techniques used include:
* Using a less efficient aerofoil which is inherently stable, such as a symmetrical form with zero camber, or even reflex camber near the trailing edge,
* Using the rear part of the wing as a lightly- or even negatively-loaded horizontal stabiliser:
**Twisting the outer leading edge down to reduce the incidence of the wing tip, which is behind the main centre of lift. This also improves stall characteristics and can benefit supersonic cruise in other ways.
**Moving the centre of mass forwards and trimming the elevator to exert a balancing downforce. In the extreme, this reduces the craft&#x27;s ability to pitch its nose up for takeoff and landing.
The main advantages of the tailless delta are structural simplicity and light weight, combined with low aerodynamic drag. These properties helped to make the Dassault Mirage III one of the most widely manufactured supersonic fighters of all time.

===Tailed delta===
A conventional tail stabiliser allows the main wing to be optimised for lift and therefore to be smaller and more highly loaded. Development of aircraft equipped with this configuration can be traced back to the late 1940s.

When used with a T-tail, as in the Gloster Javelin, like other wings a delta wing can give rise to a &quot;deep stall&quot; in which the high angle of attack at the stall causes the turbulent wake of the stalled wing to envelope the tail. This makes the elevator ineffective and the airplane cannot recover from the stall. In the case of the Javelin, a stall warning device was developed and implemented for the Javelin following the early loss of an aircraft to such conditions. Gloster&#x27;s design team had reportedly opted to use a tailed delta configuration out of necessity, seeking to achieve effective manoeuvrability at relatively high speeds for the era while also requiring suitable controllability when being flown at the slower landing speeds desired.

===Canard delta===

A lifting-canard delta can offer a smaller shift in the center of lift with increasing Mach number compared to a conventional tail configuration.

An unloaded or free-floating canard can allow a safe recovery from a high angle of attack. Depending on its design, a canard surface may increase or decrease longitudinal stability of the aircraft.

A canard delta foreplane creates its own trailing vortex. If this vortex interferes with the vortex of the main delta wing, this can adversely affect the airflow over the wing and cause unwanted and even dangerous behaviour. In the close-coupled configuration, the canard vortex couples with the main vortex to enhance its benefits and maintain controlled airflow through a wide range of speeds and angles of attack. This allows both improved manoeuvrability and lower stalling speeds, but the presence of the foreplane can increase drag at supersonic speeds and hence reduce the aircraft&#x27;s maximum speed.

==History==

===Early research===
Triangular stabilizing fins for rockets were described as early as 1529-1556 by the Austrian military engineer Conrad Haas and in the 17th century by the Polish-Lithuanian military engineer Kazimierz Siemienowicz. However, a true lifting wing in delta form did not appear until 1867, when it was patented by J.W. Butler and E. Edwards in a design for a low-aspect-ratio, dart-shaped rocket-propelled aeroplane. This was followed by various similarly dart-shaped proposals, such as a biplane version by Butler and Edwards, and a jet-propelled version by the Russian Nicholas de Telescheff. In 1909 a variant with a canard foreplane was experimented with by the Spanish sculptor Ricardo Causarás.

Also in 1909, British aeronautical pioneer J. W. Dunne patented his tailless stable aircraft with conical wing development. The patent included a broad-span biconical delta, with each side bulging upwards towards the rear in a manner characteristic of the modern Rogallo wing. During the following year, in America U. G. Lee and W. A. Darrah patented a similar biconical delta winged aeroplane with an explicitly rigid wing. It also incorporated a proposal for a flight control system and covered both gliding and powered flight. None of these early designs is known to have successfully flown although, in 1904, Lavezzani&#x27;s hang glider featuring independent left and right triangular wings had left the ground, and Dunne&#x27;s other tailless swept designs based on the same principle would fly.

The practical delta wing was pioneered by German aeronautical designer Alexander Lippisch in the 1930s, using a thick cantilever wing without any tail. His first such designs, for which he coined the name &quot;Delta&quot;, used a very gentle angle so that the wing appeared almost straight and the wing tips had to be cropped sharply (see below). His first such delta flew in 1931, followed by four successively improved examples. These prototypes were not easy to handle at low speed and none saw widespread use.

===Subsonic thick wing===

During the latter years of World War II, Alexander Lippisch refined his ideas on the high-speed delta, substantially increasing the sweepback of the wing&#x27;s leading edge. An experimental glider, the DM-1, was built to test the aerodynamics of the proposed P.13a high-speed interceptor. Following the end of hostilities, the DM-1 was completed on behalf of the United States and the shipped to Langley Field in Virginia for examination by NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, forerunner of today&#x27;s NASA) It underwent significant alterations in the US, typically to lower its drag, resulting in the replacement of its large vertical stabilizer with a smaller and more conventional counterpart, along with a normal cockpit canopy taken from a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star.

The work of French designer Nicolas Roland Payen somewhat paralleled that of Lippisch. During the 1930s, he had developed a tandem delta configuration with a straight fore wing and steep delta aft wing, similar to that of Causarás. The outbreak of the Second World War brought a halt to flight testing of the Pa-22, although work continued for a time after the project garnered German attention. During the postwar era, Payen flew an experimental tailless delta jet, the Pa.49, in 1954, as well as the tailless pusher-configuration Arbalète series from 1965. Further derivatives based on Payen&#x27;s work were proposed but ultimately went undeveloped.

Following the war, the British developed a number of subsonic jet aircraft that harnessed data gathered from Lippisch&#x27;s work. One such aircraft, the Avro 707 research aircraft, made its first flight in 1949. British military aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan (a strategic bomber) and Gloster Javelin (an all-weather fighter) were among the first delta-equipped aircraft to enter production. Whereas the Vulcan was a classic tailless design, the Javelin incorporated a tailplane in order to improve low-speed handling and high-speed manoeuvrability, as well as to allow a greater centre of gravity range. Gloster proposed a refinement of the Javelin that would have, amongst other changes, decreased wing thickness in order to achieve supersonic speeds of up to Mach 1.6.

===Supersonic thin wing===

The American aerodynamicist Robert T. Jones, who worked at NACA during the Second World War, developed the theory of the thin delta wing for supersonic flight. First published in January 1945, his approach contrasted with that of Lippisch on thick delta wings. The thin delta wing first flew on the Convair XF-92 in 1948, making it the first delta-winged jet plane to fly. It provided a successful basis for all practical supersonic deltas and the configuration became widely adopted.

During the late 1940s, the British aircraft manufacturer Fairey Aviation became interested in the delta wing, its proposals led to the experimental Fairey Delta 1 being produced to Air Ministry Specification E.10/47. A subsequent experimental aircraft, the Fairey Delta 2 set a new World air speed record on 10 March 1956, achieving 1,132 mph (1,811 km/h) or Mach 1.73. This raised the record above 1,000 mph for the first time and broke the previous record by 310 mph, or 37 per cent; never before had the record been raised by such a large margin.

In its original tailless form, the thin delta was used extensively by the American aviation company Convair and by the French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. The supersonic Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and transonic Douglas F4D Skyray were two of the first operational jet fighters to feature a tailless delta wing when they entered service in 1956. Dassault&#x27;s interest in the delta wing produced the Dassault Mirage family of combat aircraft, especially the highly successful Mirage III. Amongst other attributes, the Mirage III was the first Western European combat aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in horizontal flight.

The tailed delta configuration was adopted by the TsAGI (Central Aero and Hydrodynamic Institute, Moscow), to improve high angle-of-attack handling, manoeuvrability and centre of gravity range over a pure delta planform. The resulting TsAGI S-12 airfoil was used in the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (&quot;Fishbed&quot;), which became the most widely built combat aircraft of the 1970s.

===Close-coupled canard===
Through the 1960s, the Swedish aircraft manufacturer Saab AB developed a close-coupled canard delta configuration, placing a delta foreplane just in front of and above the main delta wing. Patented in 1963, this configuration was flown for the first time on the company&#x27;s Viggen combat aircraft in 1967. The close coupling modifies the airflow over the wing, most significantly when flying at high angles of attack. In contrast to the classic tail-mounted elevators, the canards add to the total lift as well as stabilising the airflow over the main wing. This enables more extreme manoeuvres, improves low-speed handling and reduces the takeoff run and landing speed. During the 1960s, this configuration was considered to be radical, but Saab&#x27;s design team judged that it was the optimal approach available for satisfying the conflicting performance demands for the Viggen, which including favourable STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity during low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight.

The close-coupled canard has since become common on supersonic fighter aircraft. Notable examples include the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon, France&#x27;s Dassault Rafale, Saab&#x27;s own Gripen (a successor to the Viggen) and Israel&#x27;s IAI Kfir. One of the main reasons for its popularity has been the high level of agility in manoeuvring that it is capable of.

===Supersonic transport===

When supersonic transport (SST) aircraft were developed, the tailless ogival delta wing was chosen for both the Anglo-French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, the Concorde beginning test flights in 1965 and the Tupolev first flying in 1968. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype featured an ogival delta configuration, production models of the Tu-144 differed by changing to a double delta wing. The delta wings required these airliners to adopt a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft; in the case of Concorde, lift was maintained by allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface. Its typical landing speed was , considerably higher than subsonic airliners. Multiple proposed successors, such as the Zero Emission Hyper Sonic Transport ZEHST), have reportedly adopted a similar configuration to that Concorde&#x27;s basic design, thus the Delta wing remains a likely candidate for future supersonic civil endeavours.

===Rogallo flexible wing===
During and after WWII, Francis and Gertrude Rogallo developed the idea of a flexible wing which could be collapsed for storage. Francis saw an application in spacecraft recovery and NASA became interested. In 1961, Ryan flew the XV-8, an experimental &quot;flying Jeep&quot; or &quot;fleep&quot;. The flexible wing chosen for it was a delta wing; in use, it billowed out into a double-cone profile which gave it aerodynamic stability. Although tested but ultimately never used for spacecraft recovery, this design soon became popular for hang gliders and ultra-light aircraft and has become known as the Rogallo wing.

<text>George Akropolites (Latinized as Acropolites or Acropolita; , &quot;Georgios Akropolites&quot;; 1217 or 1220 – 1282) was a Byzantine Greek historian and statesman born at Constantinople.

== Life ==
In his sixteenth year he was sent by his father, the logothete Constantine Akropolites the elder, to the court of John III Doukas Vatatzes, emperor of Nicaea, where Akropolites continued his studies under Theodore Hexapterygos and Nicephorus Blemmydes. The emperor afterwards entrusted George with important state missions, as did his successors (Theodore II Laskaris and Michael VIII Palaiologos). The office of Grand Logothete, or chancellor, was bestowed upon him in 1244. He tutored Theodore II during the 1240s.

As commander in the field in 1257 against Michael II, despot of Epirus, he showed little military ability. George was captured and kept for two years in prison, from which he was released by Michael Palaiologos. Meanwhile, Michael Palaiologos was proclaimed emperor of Nicaea, afterwards expelling the Latins from Constantinople, and became emperor of the restored Byzantine Empire. From this moment Akropolites becomes known in the history of the eastern empire as one of its greatest diplomats. After having discharged the function of ambassador at the court of the Bulgarian Tsar Constantine, he became the first head of the University of Constantinople, where he lectured on mathematics and philosophy. His students included George of Cyprus and George Pachymeres.

In the meantime, Michael, afraid of a new Latin invasion, proposed to Pope Clement IV to reunite the Greek and the Latin Churches; and negotiations ensued which were carried on during the reign of five popes, Clement IV, Gregory X, John XXI, Nicolaus III, and Martin IV. Akropolites was chosen as the emperor&#x27;s ambassador, and in 1273 he was sent to Pope Gregory X. In 1274, at the Second Council of Lyon, he confirmed by an oath in the emperor&#x27;s name that that confession of faith which had been previously sent to Constantinople by the pope had been adopted by the Greeks. The reunion of the two churches however roused considerable opposition in Byzantium and was afterwards broken off. It did however serve its main purpose, delaying and ultimately entirely averting a Latin attack on Constantinople.

Later negotiations George Akropolites led included leading a mission to the Empire of Trebizond in 1281 to convince the Emperor John II to discontinue using the title of &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot;—which Michael Palaiologos held as his sole right. He failed in this endeavor, for John responded to his arguments that he was simply following the practice of his predecessors, and his chief nobles would not permit him to give up this honor.

William Smith in his &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; follows Hankius &quot;De Byzantinarum Rerum Scriptoribus Graecis&quot; in stating that Akropolites was sent on an embassy to the king of Bulgaria in 1282; George Finlay has shown that both are in error. Finlay notes, &quot;in this case he [Hankius] seems inadvertently to have written &quot;Bulgarorum&quot; instead of &quot;Lazorum Principem&quot;, for he quotes at length the passage of Pachymeres as his authority, which states distinctly that Acropolita was sent to the prince of the Lazes, as the vain Constantinopolitan writers called the emperor of Trebizond.&quot;

== Works ==
Akropolites&#x27; historical work, the &quot;Annals&quot;, embraces the period from the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade by the Latins in 1204 to its recovery by Michael Palaiologos in 1261, thus forming a continuation of the work of Nicetas Choniates. It is valuable as written by a contemporary, whose official position as Grand Logothete, military commander, and confidential ambassador afforded him frequent opportunities of observing the course of events.

Akropolites is considered a trustworthy authority as far as the statement of facts is concerned, and he is easy to understand, although he exhibits special carelessness in the construction of his sentences. His style is archaising but lucid. He was also the author of several shorter works, amongst them being a funeral oration on John Vatatzes, an epitaph on his wife Irene Laskarina and a panegyric of Theodore II Laskaris of Nicaea. While a prisoner at Epirus he wrote two treatises on the procession of the Holy Spirit.

<doc id="142766" wikidata="Q217673" url="?curid=142766" title="Vespa">
<text>Vespa () is an Italian brand of scooters and mopeds manufactured by Piaggio. The name means wasp in Italian. The Vespa has evolved from a single model motor scooter manufactured in 1946 by Piaggio &amp; Co. S.p.A. of Pontedera, Italy, to a full line of scooters and one of seven companies today owned by Piaggio.

From their inception, Vespa scooters have been known for a painted, pressed steel body which combines, in a unified structure: a full cowling enclosure around the engine concealing dirt or grease, a flat floor panel protecting the feet, and a prominent front fairing to divert wind and rain.

==History==

After World War II, in light of its agreement to cease war activities with the Allies, Italy had its aircraft industry severely restricted in both capability and capacity.

Piaggio emerged from the conflict with its Pontedera bomber plane plant demolished by bombing. Italy&#x27;s crippled economy, and the disastrous state of its roads, were not immediately conducive to the redevelopment of the automobile market. Enrico Piaggio, the son of Piaggio&#x27;s founder Rinaldo Piaggio, decided to leave the aeronautical field to address Italy&#x27;s urgent need for a modern and affordable mode of transportation for the masses.

In 2024 Piaggio celebrated 140 years with limited edition of &#x27;Vespa 140th of Piaggio,&#x27; with only 140 units available from 18 to 21 April 2024.

===Design===

In 1944 Piaggio engineers Renzo Spolti and Vittorio Casini designed a motorcycle with bodywork fully enclosing the drivetrain and forming a tall splash guard at the front. In addition to the bodywork, the design included handlebar-mounted controls, forced air cooling, wheels of small diameter, and a tall central section that had to be straddled. Officially known as the MP5 (&quot;Moto Piaggio no. 5&quot;), the prototype was nicknamed &quot;Paperino&quot; (meaning &quot;Donald Duck&quot; in Italian).
Piaggio was displeased with the MP5, especially the tall central section. He contracted aeronautical engineer Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio, to redesign the scooter. D&#x27;Ascanio, who had earlier been consulted by Ferdinando Innocenti about scooter design and manufacture, made it immediately known that he hated motorcycles, believing them to be bulky, dirty, and unreliable.

D&#x27;Ascanio&#x27;s MP6 prototype had its engine mounted beside the rear wheel. The wheel was driven directly from the transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design instead of a tall centre section like that of the MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single-sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.

Upon seeing the MP6 for the first time, Enrico Piaggio exclaimed: &quot;Sembra una vespa!&quot; (&quot;It looks like a wasp!&quot;) Piaggio effectively named his new scooter on the spot. &quot;Vespa&quot; is both Latin and Italian for wasp—derived from the vehicle&#x27;s body shape: the thicker rear part connected to the front part by a narrow waist, and the steering rod resembled antennae.

===Product===

On 23 April 1946 at 12 o&#x27;clock in the central office for inventions, models and makes of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Florence, Piaggio e C. S.p.A. took out a patent for a &quot;motorcycle of a rational complexity of organs and elements combined with a frame with mudguards and a casing covering the whole mechanical part&quot;.

The basic patented design allowed a series of features to be deployed on the spar-frame that would later allow quick development of new models. The original Vespa featured a rear pillion seat for a passenger, or optionally a storage compartment. The original front protection &quot;shield&quot; was a flat piece of aero metal; later, this developed into a twin skin to allow additional storage behind the front shield, similar to the glove compartment in a car. The fuel cap was located underneath the (hinged) seat, which saved the cost of an additional lock on the fuel cap or need for additional metal work on the smooth skin.

The scooter had rigid rear suspension and small wheels that allowed a compact design and plenty of room for the rider&#x27;s legs. The Vespa&#x27;s enclosed, horizontally mounted 98 cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the rear drive wheel through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled gear change involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine&#x27;s spark) to push air over the cylinder&#x27;s cooling fins. The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way.

The MP6 prototype had large grilles on the front and rear of the rear fender covering the engine. This was done to allow air in to cool the engine, as the prototype did not have fan cooling. A cooling fan similar to that used on the MP5 &quot;Paperino&quot; prototype was included in the design of the production Vespa, and the grilles were removed from the fender.

==Launch==
Piaggio filed a patent for the Vespa scooter design in April 1946. The application documents referred to a &quot;model of a practical nature&quot; for a &quot;motorcycle with rationally placed parts and elements with a frame combining with mudguards and engine-cowling covering all working parts&quot;, of which &quot;the whole constitutes a rational, comfortable motorcycle offering protection from mud and dust without jeopardizing requirements of appearance and elegance&quot;. The patent was approved the following December.

The first 13 examples appeared in spring 1946, and revealed their aeronautical background. In the first examples, one can recognize the typical aircraft technology. Attention to aerodynamics is evident in all the design, in particular on the tail. It was also one of the first vehicles to use monocoque construction (where the body is an integral part of the chassis).

The company was aiming to manufacture the new Vespa in large numbers, and their longstanding industrial experience led to an efficient Ford-style volume production line. The scooter was presented to the press at Rome Golf Club, where journalists were apparently mystified by the strange, pastel coloured, toy-like object on display. However, the road tests were encouraging, and even with no rear suspension the machine was more manoeuvrable and comfortable to ride than a traditional motorcycle.

Following its public debut at the 1946 Milan Fair, the first fifty sold slowly. With the introduction of payment by installments, sales took off.

==Sales and development==

Piaggio sold some 2,500 Vespas in 1947, over 10,000 in 1948, 20,000 in 1949, and over 60,000 in 1950.

The biggest sales promotion ever came courtesy of Hollywood. In 1952, Audrey Hepburn side-saddled Gregory Peck&#x27;s Vespa in the feature film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; for a ride through Rome, resulting in over 100,000 sales. In 1956, John Wayne dismounted from his horse in favor of the two-wheeler to get between takes on sets, and Marlon Brando, Dean Martin, and the entertainer Abbe Lane had become Vespa owners. William Wyler filmed &quot;Ben Hur&quot; in Rome in 1959, allowing Charlton Heston to abandon horse and chariot between takes to take a spin on the Vespa.

Vespa clubs popped up throughout Europe, and by 1952, worldwide Vespa Club membership had surpassed 50,000. By the mid-1950s, Vespas were being manufactured under licence in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Spain; in the 1960s, production was started in India, Brazil and Indonesia. By 1956, one million had been sold, then two million by 1960. By the 1960s, the Vespa—originally conceived as a utility vehicle—had come to symbolize freedom and imagination, and resulted in further sales boosts: four million by 1970, and ten million by the late 1980s.

Improvements were made to the original design and new models were introduced. The 1948 Vespa 125 had rear suspension and a bigger engine. The headlamp was moved up to the handlebars in 1953 and had more engine power and a restyled rear fairing. A cheaper spartan version was also available. One of the best-loved models was the Vespa 150 GS introduced in 1955 with a 150 cc engine, a long saddle, and the faired handlebar-headlamp unit. Then came the 50 cc of 1963, and in 1968 Vespa 125 Primavera became one of the most durable of all.

Vespas came in two sizes, referred to as &quot;largeframe&quot; and &quot;smallframe&quot;. The smallframe scooters came in 50 cc, 90 cc, 100 cc, and 125 cc versions, all using an engine derived from the 50 cc model of 1963, and the largeframe scooters in 125 cc, 150 cc, 160 cc, 180 cc, and 200 cc displacements using engines derived from the redesigned 125 cc VNA engine from 1957.

The largeframe Vespa evolved into the PX range in the late 1970s and was produced in 125, 150 and 200 cc versions until July 2007. Starting in 1981, an 80cc version was available as well. Piaggio reintroduced the PX 125 and 150 models in 2011, with a revised EURO3 compliant engine.

The smallframe evolved into the PK range in the early 1980s, although some vintage-styled smallframes were produced for the Japanese market as late as the mid-1990s.

==1950s and beyond==
The ET model range stuck true to the wasp/aero design principles. It was lighter, more aerodynamic, had an automatic gearbox and could take a series of engines from a 50 cc in either two-stroke or four-stroke, up to a 150 cc four stroke.

===Under new ownership===

In 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the Agnelli family, the owners of car maker Fiat S.p.A. Vespa thrived until 1992 when Giovanni Alberto Agnelli became CEO, but Agnelli was already suffering from cancer and died in 1997. In 1999 Morgan Grenfell Private Equity acquired Piaggio, but a quickly hoped-for sale was dashed by a failed joint venture in China.

By 2003 the company found itself close to bankruptcy. Continual management changes and great sums spent on many different plans and products had saddled Piaggio with debt and left it vulnerable to competition from cheaper Asian rivals. Despite this, the brand was still well-known and products like the Vespa ET4 were gaining positive publicity. In October 2003 Roberto Colaninno made an initial investment of €100 million through his holding company Immsi S.p.A. in exchange for just under a third of Piaggio and the mandate to run it. Chief executive Rocco Sabelli redesigned the factory to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line.

In 2004 the company introduced a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a scooter with two wheels at the front and one at the back.

Piaggio acquired scooter and motorcycle maker Aprilia in 2006 and in that same year Piaggio shares were launched onto the Borsa Italiana with the listing symbol PIAGF.

===Relaunch in North America===

Piaggio first came back into the market in 2001 with the ET2 (two stroke 50 cc) and ET4 (four stroke 150 cc). In 2004, the PX (model year 2005) was reintroduced to North America to meet market demand for the classic Vespa design. Growth in the US market and worldwide environmental concerns meant a need for larger and cleaner engines, so Vespa developed the LEADER (Low Emissions ADvanced Engine Range) series of four-stroke engines. The larger Granturismo frame, with larger wheels, was introduced to handle the additional power. The bike in 2006 spawned the iconic GTS-250ie version, with an upgraded suspension and the new QUASAR (QUArter-liter Smooth Augmented Range) 250 cc fuel-injected engine, capable of 80+ mph. As of the end of 2010 the GTS 250 has been replaced by the GTS 300 which has a 278cc fuel – injected engine. In 2005, the ET was withdrawn from Europe and North America and replaced by a new small-frame scooter, the LX range. These were available in the US in 50 cc and 150 cc versions, while Europeans could choose a 50 cc, 125 cc and 150 cc.

==Design icon==

In recent years, many urban commuters have purchased new or restored Vespas. A shortage of available parking for automobiles in large urban areas and the Vespa&#x27;s low running costs are two reasons for the increase in Vespa (and other scooter) popularity. The cultural use of the scooter as a recreational vehicle with a sub-cultural following in the US, Canada and parts of Europe and Japan has also contributed to the rise in Vespa ownership. In contrast, the Vespa is considered a utilitarian vehicle for hauling products and sometimes up to 5 family members in much of Asia and Mexico.

This resurgence in interest in vintage motor scooters has also spawned a scooter restoration industry, with many restored Vespas being exported from Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia to the rest of the world.

There is a Piaggio Museum &amp; Gift Shop adjacent to the plant in central Pontedera, near Pisa, Tuscany. The permanent exhibition includes those items which toured venues such as the Guggenheim in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Also on display is a model personally customised by Salvador Dalí in 1962.

The Miami Auto Museum in North Miami, Florida, claims to have largest collection of Vespa scooters with over 400 items.

==Global markets==
===Europe===
Vespa&#x27;s largest market by all measures globally is still Italy, but as a result of the Mod subculture that developed in the 1960s, the United Kingdom is still Vespa&#x27;s second largest global market—and at one point in the 1960s, its largest. The appeal of the Vespa to the style-conscious mods was the weather protection. Their counterparts, the rockers rode classic British motorcycles such as Triumph Bonneville and BSAs, and needed to wear leathers against the elements. Mods would modify their Vespas, adding lights, mascots, accessories, various racks and crash bars. A new lifestyle evolved in the UK, with thousands attending scooter rallies.

The dominance of the Vespa declined through the 1970s, as small car ownership increased and cheap and reliable commuter bikes like the Honda Super Cub hit sales. Despite the introduction of the more modern &#x27;P&#x27; range in the 1970s, the lack of development cost Vespa, and like other markets, the sales fell off drastically in the economic boom of the 1980s. Then Vespa introduced the trendy automatic ET2, the city of London introduced the congestion charge and—partly with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver&#x27;s indirect help from his BBC2 TV series—sales suddenly leapt.

===North America===
Much as Vespa had used the Cushman Army scooter as inspiration for its original design, Vespa in turn made scooters for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company (labeled and marketed as &quot;Allstate&quot; scooters) and Cushman after World War II.

Imported by Morton Colby of Colby General Tire Company, 662 East Fordham Road, Bronx, New York, the Sears models were 3- and 4-speed 125 cc Vespas rebadged as Sears Allstate Cruiseaires. Innocenti also distributed their Lambretta brand via Montgomery Ward&#x27;s catalogue during this post-World War II period. These were the premier brands of scooters, bringing premium pricing to many, including farmers, whose link to the outside world was via purchases made in these catalogues. Cushman sold rebadged Vespa scooters as Cushmans, but many Cushman dealers refused to market a &quot;foreign&quot; machine. However, collectors prize the Cushman Vespa because it is relatively rare.

Two expensive product-liability lawsuits, increased competition from Japanese scooters, and certain states&#x27; passing so-called &quot;green laws&quot; led to the bankruptcy of Vespa&#x27;s American importer and the withdrawal of Vespa from the US market in late 1981.

During 1981–2001, despite an absence of United States domestic sales, Vespas continued to have a core group of enthusiasts who kept vintage scooters on the road by rebuilding, restoring, and adding performance-enhancing engine parts as the stock parts would wear out.

Vespa returned to the American market in 2001 with a new, more modern style ET series, in 50 cc two and four stroke, and 150 cc four-stroke. &quot;These adjustments in engine power and the production of high-end “touring&quot; Vespas make it apt for long-distance driving.&quot; According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, U.S. scooter sales increased fivefold over six years, swelling from 12,000 units in 1997 to 69,000 units in 2002. Vespa sales in the U.S. increased 27 percent between 2001 and 2002. The 65 &quot;Vespa Boutiques&quot; scattered throughout the U.S. gave scooterists a place to buy, service, and customize Vespa scooters, and outfit themselves in everything from Vespa watches and helmets to Vespa jackets, T-shirts, and sunglasses. Vespa restarted its American sales effort, opening its first boutique on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, California.

In light of vastly-increasing US sales, Vespa developed the GT, offered as a 200 cc four-stroke and a 125 cc variant in Europe. In 2004, Vespa reintroduced a modernized PX 150 to the United States. In the fall of 2005, Piaggio offered their largest-selling Vespa scooter ever, the 250 cc-engined GTS250, available in Europe with ABS. In 2009, Vespa released the GTS 300 which can cruise at .

=== Asia/Pacific ===
Vespa have exported Scooters to Australia since the 1960s. They have recently started exporting to India for the first time (traditionally, that market was served by licensed Indian versions of the Vespa made by LML and Bajaj). Vespa produces some of its scooters in Vietnam, and has also sold its Italian ones there.

==Production outside Italy==

Vespa scooters were sold beyond Europe and North America. When expanding into these markets it was common for Vespa to partner with, or license certain models to, existing manufacturers.

===India===
Piaggio first licensed the production of Vespa scooters in India to Bajaj Auto in the 1960s. In 1971, Piaggio&#x27;s license was not renewed as a part of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s privatization programs. After the collaboration ended, Bajaj continued to produce scooters based on the Vespa design, namely the Chetak.

Another Vespa partner in India was that of LML Motors. Beginning as a joint-venture with Piaggio in 1983, LML, in addition to being a large parts supplier for Piaggio, produced the P-Series scooters for the Indian market. In 1999, after protracted dispute with Piaggio, LML bought back Piaggio&#x27;s stake in the company and the partnership ceased. LML continued to produce (and also exported) the P-Series variant known as the Stella in the U.S. market and by other names in different markets. LML Factory which produced these P-Series variants issued a notice of insolvency on 2 June 2017 and closed down permanently in 2018.

In the 2012 Auto Expo held in New Delhi, the iconic Vespa re-entered the Indian market. Piaggio unveiled its range of scooters at the Expo. This became the first such venture of Piaggio in India without a local partner.

===Indonesia===
Danmotor Vespa Indonesia (DMVI) was a joint venture between Indonesian interests and the East Asiatic Company, which was based in Denmark. Between 1972 and 2001, it produced Vespas under license for the Indonesian market.
In 1976 approximately 40,000 units were produced giving DMVI the third biggest share of the Indonesian scooter market. Government tax incentives allowed these scooters to be exported to Thailand at less than the domestic market price, so that they would be economically competitive.
DMVI only built 90 and 150cc models. From 1972 onwards the company was located at a purpose-built factory in Pulo Gadung. This was greatly expanded in 1977 to also manufacture sub-components, following a government decree that a higher domestically built proportion of these should be used. Sub-components were also bought from other Indonesian manufacturers after their quality had been approved by Piaggio.

===Taiwan===
Vespa has had various partnerships and presence in Taiwan. In 1965, Taiwan Vespa Co. Ltd was licensed for Vespa scooter production. From 1972 to 1982, Vespa entered into a collaboration with scooter manufacturer PGO. In 1978, Vespa entered into a collaboration with TGB, which to some extent, continues to this day (namely with CVT transmission production).

===United Kingdom===
In 1951 the financially troubled motorcycle manufacturer Douglas started production of Piaggio licensed Vespa scooters in Bristol, with a market to include some Commonwealth countries as well as the UK. It was a year which also saw the first meeting of the newly-formed Vespa scooter clubs with nearly 20,000 riders showing up for the event. Westinghouse took over Douglas in 1955, and while motorcycle production was stopped in 1957, Vespa production in Britain continued until 1965.

Douglas was more than a simple assembly plant for parts imported from Piaggio; many of the models made by Douglas had a high percentage of content manufactured by Douglas (&quot;eg cylinder heads, gear clusters, brake drums and other mechanical parts&quot;) or by UK supply companies (&quot;eg seats, carburetors, tyres, and some electrical components were made in the UK&quot;). Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).

Douglas produced Vespas which were often outdated compared to current Italian models. Douglas failed to meet the production numbers hoped for by Piaggio, though after production ceased in 1965, Douglas remained the UK importer for Vespa scooters until its demise in 1982.

=== Spain ===
In 1953 a factory in Madrid began production of Motovespas, production continued until 2000. The factory was demolished in 2001.

===Soviet Union===
Between 1956 and 1966 an unauthorised, reverse-engineered version of the Vespa was built and sold in the USSR by Vyatka. This was withdrawn after protests by Piaggio.

==Racing==
In the 1950s and early 1960s Vespa and Lambretta scooters were raced competitively against motorcycles, often winning the races. In the mid-1960s, motorcycle engines became larger and faster, and a gap was created—along with varying cc classifications. Since the 1980s, Vespa and Lambretta racing has grown into a serious sport in the United States. There are various classes in the United States, depending on the racing association. They are generally:
*Small Frame Class: Open class up to 152 cc
*Automatics Class
*Specials Class

==Models==
There have been 34 different versions of the Vespa. Today five series are in production: the classic manual transmission PX and the modern CVT transmission S, LX, GT, and GTS.

<text>The Circus is a 1928 silent romantic comedy film written, produced, and directed by Charlie Chaplin. The film stars Chaplin, Al Ernest Garcia, Merna Kennedy, Harry Crocker, George Davis and Henry Bergman. The ringmaster of an impoverished circus hires Chaplin&#x27;s Little Tramp as a clown, but discovers that he can only be funny unintentionally.

The production of the film was the most difficult experience in Chaplin&#x27;s career. Numerous problems and delays occurred, including a studio fire, the death of Chaplin&#x27;s mother, as well as Chaplin&#x27;s bitter divorce from his second wife Lita Grey, and the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s claims of Chaplin&#x27;s owing back taxes, all of which culminated in filming being stalled for eight months. &quot;The Circus&quot; was the seventh-highest grossing silent film in cinema history taking in more than $3.8 million in 1928. The film continues to receive high praise. The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed, so it entered the public domain on January 1, 2024.

==Plot==

At a circus midway, the penniless and hungry Tramp is mistaken for a pickpocket and chased by both the police and the real crook (the latter having stashed a stolen wallet and watch in the Tramp&#x27;s pocket to avoid detection). Running away, the Tramp stumbles into the middle of a performance and unknowingly becomes the hit of the show.

The ringmaster/proprietor of the struggling circus gives him a tryout the next day, but the Tramp fails miserably. However, when the property men quit because they have not been paid, he gets hired on the spot to take their place. Once again, he inadvertently creates comic mayhem during a show. The ringmaster craftily hires him as a poorly paid property man who is always stationed in the performance area of the big top tent so he can unknowingly improvise comic material.

The Tramp befriends Merna, a horse rider who is treated badly by her ringmaster stepfather. She later informs the Tramp that he is the star of the show, forcing the ringmaster to pay him accordingly. With the circus thriving because of him, the Tramp also is able to secure better treatment for Merna.

After overhearing a fortune teller inform Merna that she sees &quot;love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now&quot;, the overjoyed Tramp buys a ring from another clown. Alas for him, she meets Rex, the newly hired tightrope walker. The Tramp eavesdrops as she rushes to tell the fortune teller that she has fallen in love with the new man. With his heart broken, the Tramp is unable to entertain the crowds. After several poor performances, the ringmaster warns him he has only one more chance.

When Rex cannot be found for a performance, the ringmaster (knowing that the Tramp has been practicing the tightrope act in hopes of supplanting his rival) sends the Tramp out in his place. Despite a few mishaps, including several mischievous escaped monkeys, he manages to survive the experience and receives much applause from the audience. However, when he sees the ringmaster slapping Merna around afterward, he beats the man and is fired.

Merna runs away to join him. The Tramp finds and brings Rex back with him to marry Merna. The trio go back to the circus. The ringmaster starts berating his stepdaughter, but stops when Rex informs him that she is his wife. When the traveling circus leaves, the Tramp remains behind. He picks himself up and starts walking jauntily away.

==Production==

===Development===
Chaplin first began discussing his ideas for a film about a circus as early as 1920. In late 1925, he returned from New York to California and began working on developing the film at Charlie Chaplin Studios. Set designer Danny Hall sketched out Chaplin&#x27;s early ideas for the film, with Chaplin returning to one of his older films, &quot;The Vagabond&quot; (1916), and drawing upon similar story ideas and themes for &quot;The Circus&quot;. Chaplin was a long time admirer of French comedian Max Linder, who had died in October 1925, and often borrowed gags and plot devices from Linder&#x27;s films. Some critics have pointed out the similarities between &quot;The Circus&quot; and Linder&#x27;s last completed film &quot;The King of the Circus&quot;.

===Filming===
Filming began on January 11, 1926, and the majority was completed by November. After the first month of filming, it was discovered that the film negative had been scratched; restoration work was able to eventually adjust the negative. A major fire broke out at Chaplin&#x27;s studios in September, delaying production for a month. Chaplin was served with divorce papers by Lita Grey in December, and litigation delayed the release of the film for another year.

==Release==
&quot;The Circus&quot; finally premiered in New York City on January 6, 1928, at the Strand Theatre, and in Los Angeles on January 27 at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. It came right at the beginning of the sound film era, with the very first feature sound film, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), having been released just months earlier.

Chaplin composed a new score for the film in 1967, and this new version of the film (see below) was copyrighted in 1968 to &quot;The Roy Export Company Establishment&quot; and released in 1969.

==Reception==

&quot;The Circus&quot; was well received by audiences and critics, and while its performance at the box office was good, it earned less than &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; (1925). In North America, the film earned $1,820,000 in domestic theatrical rentals. Some critics consider it and &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; to be Chaplin&#x27;s two best comedies.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mordaunt Hall reported that it was &quot;likely to please intensely those who found something slightly wanting in &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;, but at the same time it will prove a little disappointing to those who reveled in the poetry, the pathos and fine humor of his previous adventure.&quot; Hall went on to write that there were passages &quot;that are undoubtedly too long and others that are too extravagant for even this blend of humor. But Chaplin&#x27;s unfailing imagination helps even when the sequence is obviously slipping from grace.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; ran a very positive review, stating that &quot;For the picture patrons, all of them, and for broad, laughable fun – Chaplin&#x27;s best. It&#x27;s Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s best fun maker for other reasons: because it is the best straightaway story he has employed for broad film making, and because here his fun stuff is nearly all entirely creative or original in the major point.&quot;

Commenting on the long wait for the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote that &quot;it was worth it, for, if you are prone to favor superlatives here is an opportunity to coin several fresh ones&quot; and that Chaplin was &quot;as inimitable today as he was in the days of his two-reelers.&quot;

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Oliver Claxton wrote that the film was &quot;a little disappointing. There are one or two moments when it is very funny, but there are long stretches when it is either mild or dull.&quot;

==Analysis==
Film historian Jeffrey Vance views &quot;The Circus&quot; as an autobiographical metaphor:
He joins the circus and revolutionizes the cheap little knockabout comedy among the circus clowns, and becomes an enormous star. But by the end of the movie, the circus is packing up and moving on without him. Chaplin&#x27;s left alone in the empty circus ring... It reminds me of Chaplin and his place in the world of the cinema. The show is moving on without him. He filmed that sequence four days after the release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (the first successful talkie) in New York. When he put a score to &quot;The Circus&quot; in 1928, Chaplin scored that sequence with &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, the song Jolson had made famous, only Chaplin played it slowly and sorrowfully, like a funeral dirge.

In his commentary track for the Criterion Collection home video release of the film, Vance notes: 

Chaplin—a great cinema auteur—revealed his innermost feelings through his films. In The Circus, he fashioned a scenario that places The Tramp within the confines of a circus and, in so doing, documents, celebrates, and memorializes his own position as the greatest clown of his time. And, that accomplishment—beyond the wonderful comedy—ranks The Circus a major Chaplin film of considerable importance.
==Musical rescoring==
In 1947, Hanns Eisler worked on music for the film. Eisler then used the music he composed for his &quot;Septet No. 2 (&quot;Circus&quot;)&quot; for flute and piccolo, clarinet in B flat, bassoon, and string quartet. Eisler&#x27;s sketch of scene sequences and rhythms is in the Hans Eisler Archive in Berlin.

In 1967, Chaplin composed a new musical score for the film and a recording of him singing &quot;Swing Little Girl&quot; playing over the opening credits. A new version of the film opened in New York on December 15, 1969, with the new score. It was released in London in December 1970.

==Awards==
Charlie Chaplin was originally nominated for three Academy Awards, but the Academy took Chaplin out of the running by giving him a Special Award &quot;for writing, acting, directing and producing &quot;The Circus&quot;&quot;. The Academy no longer lists Chaplin&#x27;s nominations in their official list of nominees, although most unofficial lists include him.
==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;The Circus&quot; in 2002.

===Home media===
The Circus was released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection in 2019, which include trailers of the film, archival footage from the production, and an audio commentary track by Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance.

<text>An idiophone is any musical instrument that creates sound primarily by the vibration of the instrument itself, without the use of air flow (as with aerophones), strings (chordophones), membranes (membranophones) or electricity (electrophones). It is the first of the four main divisions in the original Hornbostel–Sachs system of musical instrument classification (see List of idiophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number). The early classification of Victor-Charles Mahillon called this group of instruments &quot;autophones&quot;. The most common are struck idiophones, or concussion idiophones, which are made to vibrate by being struck, either directly with a stick or hand (like the wood block, singing bowl, steel tongue drum, handpan, triangle or marimba) or indirectly, with scraping or shaking motions (like maracas or flexatone). Various types of bells fall into both categories. A common plucked idiophone is the Jew&#x27;s harp.

According to Sachs, idiophones
==Etymology==
The word is from Ancient Greek, a combination of &quot;idio-&quot; (&quot;own, personal&quot; or &quot;distinct&quot;) and &quot;-phone&quot; (&quot;voice, sound&quot;).

==Categories==
Most percussion instruments that are not drums are idiophones. Hornbostel–Sachs divides idiophones into four main sub-categories. The first division is the struck idiophones (also known sometimes as concussion idiophones). This includes most of the non-drum percussion instruments familiar in the West. They include all idiophones made to vibrate by being struck, either directly with a stick or hand (like the wood block, singing bowl, steel tongue drum, triangle or marimba) or indirectly, by way of a scraping or shaking motion (like maracas or flexatone). Various types of bells fall into both categories.

The other three subdivisions are rarer. They are plucked idiophones, such as the Jew&#x27;s harp, amplified cactus, kouxian, dan moi, music box and mbira (lamellophone or thumb piano); blown idiophones, of which there are a very small number of examples, the Aeolsklavier being one; and friction idiophones, such as the singing bowl, glass harmonica, glass harp, turntable, verrophone, daxophone, styrophone, musical saw, and nail violin (a number of pieces of metal or wood rubbed with a bow).

Other classifications use six main sub-categories.

* Concussion idiophones are instruments that produce sound by being struck against one another.
* Percussion idiophones produce sound by being struck with a non-vibrating foreign object. Examples of non-vibrating objects are mallets, hammers, and sticks. 
* Rattle idiophones are shaken. 
* Scraper idiophones are instruments that are scraped with a stick or other foreign objects to give off a sound. 
* Plucked idiophones produce sound by plucking a flexible tongue from within the instrument itself. 
* Friction idiophones are rubbed to increase vibration and sound intensity.

For example, a pop toob is a brand name for a noisemaker or musical instrument consisting of tubes that are extendable, bendable, and connectable, with the noise being created concussively by the bending and unbending, or popping, of the tube&#x27;s corrugation, whereas a whirly tube uses corrugated tubing and the difference in speed and thus air pressure to create an aerophone when spun in a circle.

==Design==
Most idiophones are made of glass, metal, ceramics, and wood. They are considered part of the percussion section in an orchestra.

A number of idiophones that are normally struck, such as vibraphone bars and cymbals, can also be bowed.

<doc id="142784" wikidata="Q312073" url="?curid=142784" title="Warner Baxter">
<text>Warner Leroy Baxter (March 29, 1889 – May 7, 1951) was an American film actor from the 1910s to the 1940s. Baxter is known for his role as the Cisco Kid in the 1928 film &quot;In Old Arizona&quot;, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 2nd Academy Awards. He frequently played womanizing, charismatic Latin bandit types in Westerns, and played the Cisco Kid or a similar character throughout the 1930s, but had a range of other roles throughout his career.

Baxter began his movie career in silent films with his most notable roles being in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1925). Baxter&#x27;s notable sound films are &quot;In Old Arizona&quot; (1929), &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933), &quot;Slave Ship&quot; (1937) with Wallace Beery, &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1938) with Freddie Bartholomew, and the 1931 ensemble short film &quot;The Stolen Jools&quot;. In the 1940s, he was well known for his recurring role as Dr. Robert Ordway in the &quot;Crime Doctor&quot; series of 10 films.

For his contributions to the motion-picture industry, Baxter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Baxter was born on March 29, 1889, in Columbus, Ohio, to Edwin F. Baxter, a cigar stand operator, and Jennie (Jane) B. Barrett. Baxter&#x27;s father died before Warner was five, and he and his mother went to live with her brother. They later moved to New York City, where he became active in dramatics, both participating in school productions and attending plays. In 1898, the two moved to San Francisco, where he graduated from Polytechnic High School. The pair were temporarily displaced by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, then returned to Columbus in 1908. After selling farm implements for a living, Baxter worked for four months as the partner of Dorothy Shoemaker in an act on the Keith Vaudeville Circuit.

==Film career==
Baxter began his film career as an extra in 1914 in a stock company. He had his first starring role in 1921 in &quot;Sheltered Daughters&quot;. The same year, he acted in &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;The Love Charm&quot;, and &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot;.

Baxter starred in 48 features during the 1920s. His most notable silent roles were in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1926), &quot;Aloma of the South Seas&quot; (1926) as an island love interest opposite dancer Gilda Gray, and as an alcoholic doctor in &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; (1928) with Lon Chaney.

David Shipman wrote in 1970,&quot;He is the beau ideal, a Valentino without a horse and the costume of a sheik. He is the fellow the girls meet around the corner, that is, if the fellow were Warner Baxter. He is the chap the lonely woman on the prairie sees when she looks at the men&#x27;s ready-to-wear pages in the latest mail order catalogue&quot;; this appraisal by Jim Tully appeared in &quot;Picturegoer&quot; in 1936. Baxter was certainly the inspiration for artwork in mail-order catalogues and adverts for pipes, the prototype for men modelling cardigans or pullovers or tweeds. During the early sound period, he was one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading actors. There was no éclat with him, no scandals, no Hollywood careering. Women liked him because he was mature and reliable. He was a good work-horse of an actor, often at the mercy of his material. When it was good, he gave positive, likeable performances. It was a long career but he is hardly remembered today.

Baxter&#x27;s most notable starring role was as The Cisco Kid in &quot;In Old Arizona&quot; (1929), the first all-talking Western, for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor. He also starred in &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933), &quot;Grand Canary&quot; (1934), &quot;Broadway Bill&quot; (1934), and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1938).

By 1936, Baxter was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, but by 1943, he had slipped to B movie roles, and he starred in a series of &quot;Crime Doctor&quot; films for Columbia Pictures. Baxter had roles in more than 100 films from 1914 to 1950. In 1936, Baxter had what Leonard Maltin considered his finest job of acting in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot;.

=== Personal troubles and breakdown ===
During the mid-1930s Baxter began to have career and personal troubles. The studio system and being a top leading man with Fox made him wealthy beyond his dreams but it also let him in for some significant personal problems. Baxter said he was envious of his friend Ronald Colman. &quot;Look at that guy. He only makes one or two pictures a year. I&#x27;ve got to work practically every day in the year.&quot; He seemed unable to pry himself away from his salary as a contract star. Some of his better roles in this period were on loan out from his home studio, Fox Picture Corporation. His MGM loan out for &quot;Robin Hood of El Dorado&quot; was an example. Director William Wellman&#x27;s recollections in the 2015 biography by his son went into some detail. Baxter, according to Wellman, was aging and troubled by that, as evidenced by a major drinking problem. Baxter told Wellman he was fine during the day but as evening approached he was &quot;gone&quot;. Adding to his own insecurities as a leading man, his home studio was not known for having a strong story department. They relied on the formula of having their major stars repeat the same type of stories and characters when it reverberated with an audience. In many cases, even for Will Rogers, it often would decrease the value of the actor&#x27;s contract. 

By 1939, he was publicly complaining about being teamed with new bright and very young actresses as he was advancing in years. He said working with Loretta Young was fine as she had been around since the silent days and fans did not view her as a youngster, but the new crop such as Lynn Bari and Arleen Whelan made him feel very uncomfortable. As his 20th Century Fox contract was nearing completion, he was openly talking of retiring, a decision he was making with his wife Winifred Bryson. By 1941, columnist Jimmie Fidler was stating the retirement talk was on the level. Some time between &quot;Adam Had Four Sons&quot; and &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; he suffered a mental breakdown. Over the subsequent years, he was fairly candid about it in interviews. He said &quot;It&#x27;s like chasing a rainbow. You never see the end of it. Each part you get has to be better than the last one and before you know it you&#x27;ve got a nervous breakdown.&quot;

The reported $284,000 ($5,315,313.12 in 2019) Baxter earned in 1936 was the highest paid contract actor that year. By 1947, he was reduced to earning $30,000 ($348,337.37 in 2019) per picture in a mere two-picture deal. He was, however, more comfortable both with his career and his life, giving much credit to his wife. &quot;I never take a role until we both talk it over. I have a high opinion of her judgment&quot;. He said he no longer cared about high budget films or being a star. &quot;I don&#x27;t need the money, and I work just to keep interested. I had a good part in a big picture about six years ago. There was tension in making it and I felt myself getting nervous again.&quot; They moved to their beach house in Malibu, California, soaking up the sun and gradually getting better. Baxter felt that the best role in motion pictures was being a leading man in a series. He had reached that conclusion during the production years of the various &quot;Crime Doctor&quot; films. &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful. I make two of them a year. Columbia has juggled it so I can make two in a row. That takes about eight weeks of my time. The rest of the year I relax. I travel. I enjoy life&quot;.

==Personal life==
Baxter married Viola Caldwell in 1911, but they were soon separated and then divorced in 1913. He married actress Winifred Bryson in 1918, remaining married until his death in 1951. Through his marriage to Bryson he was an uncle by marriage to actress Betty Bryson. Betty Bryson was born Elizabeth Bryson Meikklejohn, daughter of Winifred&#x27;s sister, Vivian.

On August 5, 1931, Baxter survived uninjured with 40 other cast and crew members the train derailment of the Southern Pacific Argonaut east of Yuma on route to Tucson for location shooting for &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;. Two trainmen were killed in the derailment. Baxter, Conchita Montenegro, and Edmund Lowe were among the passengers in cars at the end of the train.

The Baxter beach house was at 77 Malibu Beach, Malibu, California, for many years as noted in its 1942 voter roll. He also had a cabin in the San Jacinto Mountains. He was very active in Malibu civic affairs and was named honorary mayor of Malibu from 1946, replacing Brian Donlevy, through 1949. For a number of years, he had an 80-acre working ranch about 12 miles north of Palm Springs at Desert Hot Springs, the Warner Baxter Ranch, later renamed the Circle B Ranch. It was used for years as a location for western films. It was listed for sale in mid 1945 for a price of $40,000 and sold over a year later. 

During the war, Baxter was chairman of the Malibu Rationing Board and also did some troop entertaining in Army camps in the Fresno and Bakersfield areas. He and his entertainers put on dozens of day and night shows for the service men.

Baxter was a close friend of William Powell, with whom he had starred in three silent films, the best of which was &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; now considered lost. He was at Powell&#x27;s side when Jean Harlow died in 1937. His friendship with Ronald Colman was perhaps even deeper. While tennis and the film industry were the origins of their friendship going back to their earlier days at Paramount Studios, Colman and his wife Benita Hume named Baxter and Tim McCoy as godfathers to their daughter Juliet Benita Colman at her christening in 1944. Juliet Colman&#x27;s biography of her father describes in detail the very private social circle of cocktails, dinner and games of tennis or poker held between her father&#x27;s Hollywood house at 2092 Mound Street above and behind the Castle Argyle, and Baxter&#x27;s home on South Beachwood Drive.

When not acting, Baxter was an inventor who co-created a searchlight for revolvers in 1935, which allowed a shooter to more clearly see a target at night. He also developed a radio device that allowed emergency crews to change traffic signals from two blocks away, providing them with safe passage through intersections. He financed the device&#x27;s installation at a Beverly Hills intersection in 1940.

== Death ==
Baxter suffered from arthritis for several years, as well as a chronic illness which caused eating difficulties and induced malnutrition. In 1951, he underwent a lobotomy as a last resort to ease the chronic pain. On May 7, 1951, he died of pneumonia at age 62 and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California in a private funeral service described as markedly reminiscent of the film capital&#x27;s earlier days. Among his pallbearers were friends Ronald Colman and William Powell. He left all his property to his wife. 

Winifred married St. Louis architect Ferdinand Herman Menger at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 15, 1953. They would remain married until the end of her life.

==Recognition==
In 1960, Baxter posthumously received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6284 Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="142785" wikidata="Q741482" url="?curid=142785" title="George Bancroft">
<text>George Bancroft (October 3, 1800 – January 17, 1891) was an American historian, statesman and Democratic politician who was prominent in promoting secondary education both in his home state of Massachusetts and at the national and international levels.

During his tenure as U.S. Secretary of the Navy, he established the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a senior American diplomat in Europe, leading diplomatic missions to Britain and Germany. Among his best-known writings is the magisterial series, &quot;History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bancroft was born on October 3, 1800, in Worcester, Massachusetts. His family had been in Massachusetts Bay since 1632. 

George&#x27;s father, Aaron Bancroft, was distinguished as a Revolutionary War soldier, a leading Unitarian clergyman, and author of a popular biography of George Washington.

===Education===
Bancroft began his education at Phillips Exeter Academy.

He entered Harvard College at thirteen years of age and graduated with the Class of 1817.

After Harvard, Bancroft&#x27;s father sent him abroad to study in Germany, where he studied at the universities of Göttingen, and Berlin. At Göttingen, he studied Plato with Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, history with Heeren and Gottlieb Jakob Planck, and languages and scripture interpretation with Albert Eichhorn, natural science with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, German literature with Georg Friedrich Benecke, French and Italian literature with Artaud and Bunsen, and classics with Georg Ludolf Dissen. In 1820, he received his doctorate from the University of Göttingen.

Bancroft capped off his education with a European tour, in the course of which he sought out almost every distinguished man in the European world of letters, science and art, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Lord Byron, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Christian Charles Josias Bunsen, Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Varnhagen von Ense, Victor Cousin, Benjamin Constant and Alessandro Manzoni.

==Early career==
Bancroft returned to the United States in 1822. While the young man delivered several sermons at his father&#x27;s behest shortly after his return, his love of literature proved a stronger attachment.

His first position was as a tutor of Greek at Harvard. Bancroft chafed at the narrow curriculum of Harvard in his day and the pedantic spirit of its classics curriculum. Moreover, his personal affect of ardent Romanticism subjected him to ridicule among the formal society of New England and his political sympathies for Jacksonian democracy put him at odds with nearly all of the Boston elite.

===Round Hill School===
In 1823, he published his first work, a little volume of poetry, translations and original pieces, which brought no fame. Bancroft finally left Cambridge and with Joseph Cogswell established the Round Hill School at Northampton, Massachusetts.

While at Round Hill, Bancroft contributed frequently to the &quot;North American Review&quot; and &quot;American Quarterly&quot;. He also made a translation of Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren&#x27;s work on &quot;The Politics of Ancient Greece&quot;. In 1836, he published an oration advocating universal suffrage and the foundation of the state on the power of the whole people.

===State politics===
In 1830, he was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate from Northampton without his knowledge by the support of the Working Men&#x27;s Party, but refused to take his seat. and the next year he declined another nomination, though certain to have been elected, for the state senate.

==Historian==
Bancroft, having trained in the leading German universities, was an accomplished scholar, whose masterwork &quot;History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent&quot; covered the new nation in depth down to 1789. His &quot;History of the United States&quot; started appearing in 1834, and he constantly revised it in numerous editions. It remains among the most comprehensive histories of colonial America.

===Themes===
Bancroft was a Romantic, emphasizing nationalist and republican values. Bancroft played on four recurring themes to explain the development of American values: providence, progress, patria, and pan-democracy. &quot;Providence&quot; meant that destiny depended more on God than on human will. The idea of &quot;progress&quot; indicated that through continuous reform a better society was possible. Patria was deserved because America&#x27;s spreading influence would bring liberty and freedom to more and more of the world. &quot;Pan-democracy&quot; meant the nation-state was central to the drama, not specific heroes or villains.

Richard C. Vitzthum argues that Bancroft&#x27;s histories exemplify his Unitarian moral vision of faith in progress. The history of America, in Bancroft&#x27;s view, exemplified the gradual unfolding of God&#x27;s purpose for mankind – the development of religious and political liberty.

George M. Frederickson argues that Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;universalist theory of national origins... made the American Revolution not only the fruit of a specific historical tradition, but also a creed of liberty for all mankind.&quot;

===Historiographical reception and legacy===
Bancroft&#x27;s orotund romantic style and enthusiastic patriotism fell out of favor with later generations of scientific historians, who did not assign his books to students. After 1890, American scholars of the Imperial School took a more favorable view of the British Empire than Bancroft.

Edmund Morgan compares Bancroft&#x27;s history to that of the Liberal statesman Sir George Trevelyan in that both reject the Progressive view of the Revolution as a mere invocation of political philosophy as a means to keep and consolidate power. Morgan and other neo-Whig historians have embraced Bancroft&#x27;s view that the patriots were motivated by a deep commitment to individual liberty.

Inspired by Bancroft, Bernard Bailyn and a cohort of mid-twentieth-century historians challenged the dichotomy between &quot;national self-awareness&quot; and the study of history. Although they had found &quot;limitations&quot; in Bancroft&#x27;s works, mid-twentieth-century &quot;instrumentalist&quot; historians wished to reexamine the &quot;image of colonial origins&quot; of the American Revolution. By 1956, this subset of scholars had tentatively determined that, &quot;toward the end of the seventeenth century there emerged an entire apparatus of local politics&quot; that &quot;came, gradually, to accommodate itself&quot; within the imperial system and in various &quot;forms...it is their collapse under the pressures of new circumstances after 1760 that alone made the Revolution
&#x27;irrepressible.&#x27; &quot;

==Political and diplomatic career==
===Collector of Boston===
In 1837, Bancroft entered active politics by accepting an appointment as Collector of Customs of the Port of Boston by President Martin Van Buren. Two of his own appointees in the office were Orestes Brownson and author Nathaniel Hawthorne.

In 1844, Bancroft was the Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts but he was defeated. He called for the annexation of Texas as extending &quot;the area of freedom&quot; and opposed slavery.

===Secretary of the Navy===
In 1845, in recognition for his support at the previous Democratic convention, Bancroft was appointed to James Polk&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1846, when, for a month, he was acting Secretary of War.

During his short period in the cabinet, Bancroft established the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, creating a legacy of education and leadership. He ordered naval action that resulted in the occupation of California and, as secretary of War, sent Zachary Taylor into the contested land between Texas and Mexico. That catalyzed the Mexican War, resulting in the United States greatly increasing its territory in the Southwest.

Bancroft designed and developed the Naval Academy; he received all the appropriations for which he asked. Congress had never been willing to establish a naval academy, but Bancroft studied the law to assess the powers of the Secretary of the Navy. He found that he could order &quot;a place where midshipmen should wait for orders.&quot; He could also direct instructors to give lessons to them at sea, and by law, instructors could follow the midshipmen to the place of their common residence on shore. The appropriation of the year for the naval service met the expense, and the Secretary of War ceded an abandoned military post to the navy.

Therefore, when Congress came together, it learned that the midshipmen not at sea were housed at Annapolis. Thus, they were protected from the dangers of idleness and city life and busy at a regular course of study. Congress accepted the school, which was in full operation, and granted money for the repairs of the buildings.

Bancroft introduced some new respected professors into the corps of instructors, and he suggested a system of promotion, related to experience and achievements as well as age. The merit system was not fully developed or applied at the time. Bancroft was influential also in obtaining additional appropriations for the United States Naval Observatory.

===Minister to the United Kingdom===
Similarly, Bancroft studied so deeply the Oregon boundary dispute that in 1846, he was sent as minister plenipotentiary to London to work with the British government on the issue. There, he roomed with the historian Macaulay and the poet Hallam. With the election of Whig Zachary Taylor as president, Bancroft&#x27;s political appointment ended. On his return to the United States in 1849, he withdrew from public life and moved to New York, where he focused on writing history.

===Return to private life===

As a private citizen, Bancroft initially expressed skepticism towards Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election, describing him as, &quot;without brains,&quot; and &quot;ignorant, self-willed, and... surrounded by men some of whom are almost as ignorant as himself.&quot; However, Bancroft softened to the wartime president after initiating correspondence with Lincoln in 1861, and used the communication to argue for the case of abolishing slavery. In April 1864, at Bancroft&#x27;s request, President Abraham Lincoln wrote out what would become the fourth of five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address. Bancroft planned to include the copy in &quot;Autograph Leaves of Our Country&#x27;s Authors&quot;, which he planned to sell at a Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Sanitary Fair, in Baltimore, to raise money to care for the Union Army.

In 1866, he was chosen by Congress to deliver the special eulogy on Lincoln.

===Minister to Prussia and Germany===
In 1867, President Andrew Johnson offered Bancroft the post of US minister to Prussia, enabling him to return to Germany. Bancroft remained in Berlin for seven years, throughout the Franco-Prussian War and German unification.

President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him minister to the German Empire in 1871. During his tenure in Berlin, Bancroft spent much time negotiating agreements with Prussia and the other north German states relating to naturalization and citizenship issues; they became known as the Bancroft Treaties in his honor. The treaties were the first international recognition of the right of expatriation. The principle has since incorporated in the law of nations.

===San Juan Islands arbitration===
His last official achievements were his participation in the 1872 arbitration on the status of the San Juan Islands, stemming from the Pig War of 1859. The United States maintained that the disputed channel was intended to be the Haro Strait, while Great Britain believed that it was the Rosario Strait. In the San Juan arbitration Bancroft displayed great versatility and skill and won the case, which was decided by a commission (three eminent German Judges) appointed by the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm. The final ruling was issued on October 21, 1872, and British troops withdrew from San Juan Island on November 22, 1872, after 26 years of maintaining an amicable, yet tense relationship.

==Personal life==
===Family===
His first wife was Sarah Dwight, of a rich family in Springfield, Massachusetts; they married in 1827 and had two sons. She died in 1837. He formed a second marriage with Mrs Elizabeth Davis Bliss, a widow with two children. Together they had a daughter.

In his later years Bancroft lived in Washington, D.C., summering at &quot;Rose Cliff&quot;, Newport, Rhode Island, the site where Rosecliff was later built.

===Organizations===
Bancroft was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838, and also served as its Secretary of Domestic Correspondence from 1877 to 1880.

In 1841, Bancroft was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In New York, Bancroft was a founding member of the American Geographical Society and served as the society&#x27;s first president for nearly three years (February 21, 1852 – December 7, 1854).

Bancroft was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1863.

Bancroft served as the President of the American Historical Association, 1885-1886. 

==Death==

Bancroft died in 1891, in Washington, D.C. He was the last surviving member of the Polk cabinet.

<doc id="142786" wikidata="Q742569" url="?curid=142786" title="Thunderbolt (1929 film)">
<text>Thunderbolt (also released as At The Gates of Death) is a 1929 American pre-Code proto-noir film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring George Bancroft, Fay Wray, Richard Arlen, Tully Marshall and Eugenie Besserer. It tells the story of a criminal, facing execution, who wants to kill the man in the next cell for being in love with his former girlfriend.

The film was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, Joseph L. Mankiewicz (titles) and Josef von Sternberg from the story by Jules and Charles Furthman.

Bancroft was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

==Plot==
Thunderbolt Jim Lang (George Bancroft), wanted on robbery and murder charges, ventures out with his girl, &quot;Ritzy&quot; (Fay Wray), to a Harlem nightclub, where she informs him that she is going straight. During a raid on the club, Thunderbolt escapes. His gang shadows Ritzy and reports that she is living with Mrs. Moran (Eugenie Besserer), whose son, Bob (Richard Arlen), a bank clerk, is in love with Ritzy. Fearing for Bob&#x27;s safety, Ritzy engineers a police trap for Thunderbolt; he escapes but is later captured, tried, and sentenced to be executed at Sing Sing. From the death house, he successfully plots to frame Bob in a bank robbery and killing. Bob is placed in the facing cell, and guards frustrate Thunderbolt&#x27;s attempts to get to his rival. When Ritzy marries Bob in the death house, Thunderbolt confesses his part in Bob&#x27;s conviction. He plots to kill the boy on the night of his execution, but instead at the last minute his hand falls on Bob&#x27;s shoulder in a gesture of friendship.

==Production==
===Sound===
&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; was Sternberg’s first film using synchronized sound technology. Two versions of the film were produced, including a silent version for theatres that had yet to be adapted to sound.

The technical innovation of synchronized dialogue in the film raised concerns among directors as to its potential influence on the visual techniques available to directors. Internationally, filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Alfred Hitchcock, and Dziga Vertov wished to avoid oppressive forms of ”theatrically-influenced dialogue” even as audiences clamored for the novelty of naturalistic speech.

Sternberg welcomed sound as a means to achieve complete control over his picture - &quot;no longer at the mercy of movie house organists&quot; - and eschewing any &quot;atmospheric&quot; or background music. &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (as well as his next three sound films) used source music that arose directly from the mise en scène.

Sternberg experimented with asynchronous sound effects which served to augment or supplement the visual effects, or as he framed the process, “To be correctly and effectively used, the sound had to bring to the image a quality other than what the lens included, a quality out of the range of the image. Sound had to counterpoint or compensate the image, add to it – not subtract from it.” Throughout &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, Sternberg “uses sound to paint audio images” through “complementary and contrapuntal juxtaposition.” Rather than the external and complementary musical accompaniment of silent films, Sternberg’s scores arise organically with the mise-en-scène and form a key component of the film.

The music off-screen does not recede in deference to the on-screen dialogue, but competes with it. Off-screen, voices comment on the visual action, but are not identified visually until later in the film sequence, contributing to an “unrealistic cadence” that characterizes the film’s dialogue. Film historian Andrew Sarris describes it as &quot;a startling experiment... his use of sound and music for mood effects, and the very unreality of his style seems to justify the unusual density of his sound track.&quot; Sternberg also uses sound expressionistically, such as the erratic start-stop of a sewing machine or the “sinister” squeaking of a dog’s ball toy, squeezed by the condemned criminal in the hours before his death.

==Reception==

Mordaunt Hall writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (June 21, 1929) described the screenplay as “a musical comedy plot striving to masquerade as drama.” Film critic Andrew Sarris would echo that assessment in 1966, writing “&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; is, in some respects, as much a musical as a melodrama.”

Film historian Janet Bergstrom points out that “reviewers were relieved that Sternberg had returned to the gangster genre he had invented and made popular&quot;, as in this review entitled “&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Registers Hit” from Norbert Lusk of the Los Angeles Times (June 30, 1929):

German filmmaker Ludwig Berger contacted Sternberg via telegram with lavish praise: &quot;I saw your film &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; and congratulate you with all my heart. It is the first fully realized and artistically accomplished Sound film. Bravo!&quot;

<text>John Chester Brooks Morris (February 16, 1901 – September 11, 1970) was an American stage, film, television, and radio actor. He had some prestigious film roles early in his career, and received an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Alibi&quot; (1929). Morris is remembered for portraying Boston Blackie, a criminal-turned-detective, in the &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; film series of the 1940s.

==Early years==

Chester Morris was born John Chester Brooks Morris in New York City, and was one of five children of Broadway stage actor William Morris and stage comedienne Etta Hawkins. His siblings who lived to adulthood were screenwriter-actor Gordon Morris, actor Adrian Morris, and actress Wilhelmina Morris. Another brother, Lloyd Morris, had died young.

Morris dropped out of school and began his Broadway career at 15 years old opposite Lionel Barrymore in &quot;The Copperhead&quot;. He made his film debut in the silent comedy-drama film &quot;An Amateur Orphan&quot; (1917).

After appearing in several more Broadway productions in the early 1920s, Morris joined his parents, sister, and two brothers, Gordon and Adrian, on the vaudeville circuit. From 1923, they performed William Morris&#x27; original sketch called &quot;All the Horrors of Home&quot;, which premiered at the Palace Theatre, New York, then on the Keith-Orpheum circuit for two years, including Proctor&#x27;s Theatre, Mount Vernon, New York, and culminating in Los Angeles in 1925. Morris returned to Broadway with roles in &quot;The Home Towners&quot; (1926) and &quot;Yellow&quot; (1927). While appearing in the 1927 play &quot;Crime&quot;, he was spotted by a talent agent and was signed to a film contract.

==Career==
Morris made his sound film debut in the 1929 film &quot;Alibi&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He followed with roles in &quot;Woman Trap&quot; (1929), &quot;The Case of Sergeant Grischa&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Divorcee&quot;, starring Norma Shearer in 1930. Later that year, Morris was cast as one of the leads (with Wallace Beery and Robert Montgomery) in the MGM prison drama &quot;The Big House&quot;. For the next two years, he worked steadily in films for United Artists and MGM and was cast opposite Jean Harlow in the 1932 comedy-drama &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;.

By the mid- to late 1930s, Morris&#x27; popularity had begun to wane and he was cast as the lead actor in such B-movies as &quot;Smashing the Rackets&quot; (1938) and &quot;Five Came Back&quot; (1939). In 1941, Morris&#x27; career was revived when he was cast as criminal-turned-detective Boston Blackie. Morris appeared in a total of 14 &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; films for Columbia Pictures, beginning with &quot;Meet Boston Blackie&quot;. He reprised the role of Boston Blackie for the radio series in 1944. During World War II, Morris performed magic tricks in over 350 USO shows. He had been practicing magic since the age of 12 and was considered a top amateur magician.

While appearing in the &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; series, Morris continued to appear in roles in other films mostly for Pine-Thomas films for Paramount Pictures. After appearing in 1949&#x27;s &quot;Boston Blackie&#x27;s Chinese Venture&quot;, the final &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; film, Morris largely retired from films. During the 1950s, he focused mainly on television and theatre, returning to Broadway in 1954 in the comedy &quot;The Fifth Season&quot;. During this time, Morris also appeared in guest spots for the anthology series &quot;Cameo Theatre&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;The Web&quot;, &quot;Phillip Morris Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, and &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;. He briefly returned to films in 1955 with a role in the prison drama &quot;Unchained&quot;, followed by a role in the 1956 science-fiction horror film &quot;The She-Creature&quot;. In 1960, he had recurring role as Detective Lieutenant Max Ritter in the CBS summer replacement series, &quot;&quot;. The series lasted a year, after which Morris appeared in the NBC television film &quot;A String of Beads&quot;. In November 1960, he returned to Broadway as Senator Bob Munson in the stage adaptation of the 1959 novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;. Morris remained with the production until it closed in May 1961. In October, he reprised his role for the touring production.

In the early to mid-1960s, Morris appeared in guest spots for the dramas &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;. In 1965, he replaced Jack Albertson in the Broadway production of &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot;. He reprised his role in the play for the touring production in 1966.

==Illness and death==
In mid-1968, Morris starred opposite Barbara Britton in the touring production of &quot;Where Did We Go Wrong?&quot;. After the production wrapped, he returned to his home in Manhattan, where his health began to decline. Morris was later diagnosed with stomach cancer.

Despite his declining health, Morris began work on what was his last film role, as Pop Weaver in the biographical drama &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; (1970). The film was released after his death. After filming wrapped, Morris joined the stage production of &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court Martial&quot; at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

On September 11, 1970, Lee R. Yopp, the producer and director of &quot;Caine&quot;, was scheduled to have lunch with Morris. After Yopp could not reach Morris by phone at his motel room, he went to Morris&#x27;s room, where he found the actor&#x27;s body lying on the floor. The county coroner attributed Morris&#x27;s death to an overdose of barbiturates. His remains were cremated and scattered over a German river.

==Personal life==

Morris was married twice. He first married Suzanne Kilbourne on November 8, 1926. They had two children, John Brooks and Cynthia. Kilbourne was granted an interlocutory divorce in November 1939 which was finalized on November 26, 1940.

On November 30, 1940, Morris married socialite Lillian Kenton Barker at the home of actor Frank Morgan. They had a son, Kenton, born in 1944. The couple remained married until Morris&#x27;s death in 1970.

<doc id="142788" wikidata="Q205348" url="?curid=142788" title="Gas chamber">
<text>A gas chamber is an apparatus for killing humans or animals with gas, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a poisonous or asphyxiant gas is introduced. Poisonous agents used include hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide.

==History==
General Rochambeau developed a rudimentary method in 1803, during the Haitian Revolution, filling ships&#x27; cargo holds with sulfur dioxide to suffocate prisoners of war. The scale of these operations was brought to larger public attention in the book &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Crimes&quot; (2005), although the allegations of scale and sources were heavily questioned.

In America, the utilization of a gas chamber was first proposed by Allan McLane Hamilton to the state of Nevada. Since then, gas chambers have been used as a method of execution of condemned prisoners in the United States and continue to be a legal execution method in three states, seeing legislated reintroduction with inert N2, although redundant in practice since the early 1990s.

Lithuania used gas chambers for civilian, penal use in the 1930s, with the last known execution carried out in 1940. The Soviet Union allegedly used the method to perform executions during the Great Purge, including by use of gas vans. Prisoners were gassed on the way to the Butovo firing range, where the NKVD normally executed its prisoners by shooting them. None of these saw mass use, however, and were strictly for &quot;criminal&quot; purposes.

Most notably, during the Holocaust large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by Nazi Germany from the late 1930s, as part of the &quot;Aktion T4&quot;, and later for its genocide program.

More recently, escapees from North Korea have alleged executions to have been performed by gas chamber in prison camps, often combined with medical experimentation.

==Nazi Germany==


Nazi Germany made extensive use of various types of gas chambers for mass-murder during the Holocaust.

Beginning in 1939, gas chambers were used as part of &quot;Aktion T4&quot;, an &quot;involuntary euthanasia&quot; program under which the Nazis murdered people with physical and intellectual disabilities, whom the Nazis considered &quot;unworthy of life&quot;. Experiments in the gassing of patients were conducted in October 1939 in occupied Poznań in Poland. Hundreds of prisoners were murdered by carbon monoxide poisoning in an improvised gas chamber. In 1940, gas chambers using bottled pure carbon monoxide were established at six killing centres in Germany. In addition to persons with disabilities, these centres were also used during Action 14f13 to murder prisoners transferred from concentration camps in Germany, Austria, and Poland. Concentration camp inmates continued to be murdered even after the euthanasia program was officially shut down in 1941.

During the invasion of the Soviet Union, mass executions by exhaust gas were performed by &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; using gas vans, trucks modified to divert engine exhaust into a sealed interior gas chamber.

Starting in 1941, gas chambers were used at extermination camps in Poland for the mass-murder of Jews, Roma, and other victims of the Holocaust. Gas vans were used at the Chełmno extermination camp. The Operation Reinhard extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka used exhaust fumes from stationary diesel engines. In search of more efficient killing methods, the Nazis experimented with using the hydrogen cyanide-based fumigant Zyklon B at the Auschwitz concentration camp. This method was adopted for mass-murder at the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps. Up to 6,000 victims were gassed with Zyklon B each day at Auschwitz.

Most extermination camp gas chambers were dismantled or destroyed in the last months of World War II as Soviet troops approached, except for those at Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Majdanek. One destroyed gas chamber at Auschwitz was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial.

==North Korea==
Kwon Hyok, a former head of security at Camp 22, described laboratories equipped with gas chambers for suffocation gas experiments, in which three or four people, normally a family, are the experimental subjects. After the chambers are sealed and poison is injected through a tube, while scientists observe from above through glass. In a report reminiscent of an earlier account of a family of seven, Kwon claims to have watched one family of two parents, a son and a daughter die from suffocating gas, with the parents trying to save the children using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for as long as they had the strength. Kwon&#x27;s testimony was supported by documents from Camp 22 describing the transfer of prisoners designated for the experiments. The documents were identified as genuine by Kim Sang Hun, a London-based expert on Korea and human rights activist.

==Lithuania==
In 1937–1940, Lithuania operated a gas chamber in Aleksotas within the First Fort of the Kaunas Fortress. Previous executions were carried out by hanging or by shooting. However, these methods were viewed as brutal and in January 1937, the criminal code was amended to provide execution by gas which at the time was viewed as more civilized and humane. Lithuania considered and rejected execution by poison. Unlike the American or German model the Lithuanian gas chamber, built out of bricks, worked by inputting compressed lethal gas from an external storage cylinder (Černevičiūtė 2014). The first execution was carried on July 27, 1937: Bronius Pogužinskas, age 37, convicted of murder of five people from a Jewish family. Historian Sigita Černevičiūtė counted at least nine executions in the gas chamber, though records are incomplete and fragmentary. Of the nine, eight were convicted of murder. One of these, Aleksandras Maurušaitis, was also convicted of anti-government actions during the 1935 Suvalkija strike. The last known execution took place on May 19, 1940, for robbery. The fate of the gas chamber after the occupation by the Soviet Union in June 1940 is unclear.

==Soviet Union==

The invention of mobile gas chambers, based on adapted vans with the storage compartment sealed and exhaust redirected inside, was attributed to Soviet NKVD officer Isai D. Berg. Starting in 1937, he supervised execution of prisoners by gassing them in trucks. Providing testimony of this when he was himself arrested by the NKVD in August 1938, Berg stated that he and a team of secret police officers suffocated batches of prisoners with engine fumes in camouflaged cars while transporting them from the Taganka or Butyrka prisons in Moscow to the mass graves at the Butovo firing range, where the prisoners were subsequently buried. Examining documents related to Berg, &quot;Kommersant&quot; reported that Berg had led of the administrative and economic department of the Moscow Oblast NKVD; Berg stated that he acted on orders from the higher NKVD administration.

Gas vans were also reportedly used in other parts of the Soviet Union. According to high-ranking NKVD officer Mikhail Schreder, they were used in the city of Ivanovo similar to that in Moscow: &quot;When a closed truck arrived at the place of execution, all convicts were dragged out of cars in an unconscious state. On the way, they were almost killed by exhaust fumes redirected through a special tube into the closed cargo compartment of the truck.&quot; Soviet dissident Petro Grigorenko described in his memoirs a story told by his close friend and former prisoner of Gulag Vasil Teslia. He described killings of &quot;kulaks&quot; in a prison in Omsk. According to him, more than 27 people were loaded to a truck, which moved away from the prison, but soon returned back. &quot;When the doors were opened, black smoke poured out and corpses of people rained down.&quot; The corpses were then placed into the basement. Teslia watched such executions during whole week.

==United States==

Gas chambers have been used for capital punishment in the United States to execute death row inmates. The first person to be executed in the United States by lethal gas was Gee Jon, on February 8, 1924. An unsuccessful attempt to pump poison gas directly into his cell at Nevada State Prison led to the development of the first makeshift gas chamber to carry out Jon&#x27;s death sentence.

On December 3, 1948, Miran Thompson and Sam Shockley were executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison for their role in the Battle of Alcatraz.

In 1957, Burton Abbott was executed as the governor of California, Goodwin J. Knight, was on the telephone to stay the execution.

Since the restoration of the death penalty in the United States in 1976, 11 executions by gas chamber have been conducted. Four were conducted in Mississippi, 2 in Arizona, 2 in California, 2 in North Carolina, and 1 in Nevada. The first execution via gas chamber since the restoration of the death penalty was in Nevada in 1979, when Jesse Bishop was executed for murder. The most recent execution via gas chamber was in 1999. By the 1980s, reports of suffering during gas chamber executions had led to controversy over the use of this method.

At the September 2, 1983, execution of Jimmy Lee Gray in Mississippi, officials cleared the viewing room after 8 minutes while Gray was still alive and gasping for air. The decision to clear the room while he was still alive was criticized by his attorney. In 2007, David Bruck, an attorney specializing in death penalty cases, said, &quot;Jimmy Lee Gray died banging his head against a steel pole in the gas chamber while reporters counted his moans.&quot;

During the April 6, 1992, execution of Donald Eugene Harding in Arizona, it took 11 minutes for death to occur. The prison warden stated that he would quit if required to conduct another gas chamber execution. Following Harding&#x27;s execution, Arizona voted that all persons condemned to death after November 1992 would be executed by lethal injection.

Following the execution of Robert Alton Harris in 1992, a federal court declared that &quot;execution by lethal gas under the California protocol is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.&quot; However, this decision was vacated after California amended its statute to allow death row inmates to choose between lethal injection and the gas chamber. By the late 20th century, most states had switched to methods considered to be more humane, such as lethal injection. California&#x27;s gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison was converted to an execution chamber for lethal injection.

As of 2020, the last person to be executed in the gas chamber was German national Walter LaGrand, sentenced to death before 1992, who was executed in Arizona on March 3, 1999. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that he could not be executed by gas chamber, but the decision was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. The gas chamber was formerly used in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Oregon. Seven states (Alabama, Arizona, California, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Wyoming) authorize lethal gas if lethal injection cannot be administered, the condemned committed their crime before a certain date, or the condemned chooses to die in the gas chamber. Alabama, Mississippi, and Oklahoma specify the nitrogen hypoxia method, Arizona specifies the hydrogen cyanide method, and the other states do not specify the type of gas. In October 2010, Governor of New York David Paterson signed a bill rendering gas chambers illegal for use by humane societies and other animal shelters.

==Method of use==
===Using hydrogen cyanide===

The hydrogen cyanide gas chamber is considered to be the most dangerous, most complicated, most time-consuming and most expensive method of administering the death penalty. It is also notoriously impossible to halt once initiated, which has occurred in the case of stays, such as in the case of Burton Abbott. The same event supposedly occurred in the final, completed execution of Caryl Chessman in 1960. The condemned person is strapped into a chair within an airtight chamber, which is then sealed. The executioner activates a mechanism which drops potassium cyanide (or sodium cyanide) pellets into a bath of sulfuric acid beneath the chair; the ensuing chemical reaction generates lethal hydrogen cyanide gas.

The condemned is advised to take several deep breaths to speed unconsciousness. Nonetheless, the condemned person often convulses and drools and may also urinate, defecate, and vomit.

Following the execution the chamber is purged with air, and any remnant gas is neutralized with anhydrous ammonia, after which the body can be removed (with great caution, as pockets of gas can be trapped in the victim&#x27;s clothing).

===Excluding all oxygen===

Nitrogen gas or oxygen-depleted air has been considered for human execution, as it can induce nitrogen asphyxiation. The victim detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to asphyxiation (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation, or the side effects of poisoning.

In April 2015, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin approved a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution method. On March 14, 2018, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter and Corrections Director Joe M. Allbaugh announced a switch to nitrogen gas as the state&#x27;s primary method of execution. After struggling for years to design a nitrogen execution protocol, the State of Oklahoma announced in February 2020 that it was abandoning the project after finding a reliable source of drugs to carry out the lethal injection executions.

In 2018, Alabama approved nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution method and allowed death row inmates a choice of method. In September 2022, a court stayed the execution of Alan Eugene Miller, who was set to be executed by lethal injection. Miller asserted that he had chosen nitrogen hypoxia as his method of execution, as permitted by Alabama law, but the form documenting his choice had been lost. The court decided to stay the execution to allow for further investigation into his claim. On January 25, 2024, Kenneth Eugene Smith became the first person to be executed by nitrogen asphyxiation.

<text>Chi Cheng (Chinese: 紀政; born March 15, 1944) is a Taiwanese politician and athlete in track and field. She was an Olympic medalist in 1968 and was named the Associated Press Athlete of the Year for 1970. She was a former pentathlete turned sprinter.

==Biography==

Chi won a Kuomintang scholarship and began her college education at the University of Hawaii, later transferring to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) in Pomona, California, where she received most of her athletic training. As a student there, she won four U.S. national championships and over a two-year period was the winner of 153 of the 154 events she entered. Representing the Republic of China, she ran in the 1960 and 1964 Olympics, then won the bronze medal in the women&#x27;s 80-meter hurdles in the 1968 Summer Olympics and finished 7th in the 100 metre final.

In 1969, she broke three world records. In 1970, she broke or tied five world records, accomplishing 3 in the space of just one week. She was first woman to run 10.0 second for 100 yards. She also ran world bests of 11.0 for 100 metres, 22.4 for 200 metres, 22.6 for 220 yards, and 12.8 for 100 metre hurdles. She won the gold medal in the 100 metres at the 1970 Asian Games in Bangkok in a games record time. While leading in the 400 metres at the same Asian Games, she suffered a severe leg cramp at 330 metres, which eventually led to a career ending injury. She was ranked number one in the world for 100 metres and 200 metres, second in the 400 metres and third in 100 metres hurdles in 1970 and was undefeated in 69 races that season.

Despite not competing in any high level international championships after 1970, Cheng continued to compete for several years domestically under the name Chi Cheng Reel for the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos track and field team, winning several DGWS national titles. She officially retired in 1973.

For her achievement, Chi Cheng was named the Associated Press Athlete of the Year. Also, she became the Director of Women&#x27;s Athletics at the University of Redlands, California, from 1974 to 1976.

Chi naturalised as a U.S. citizen, but later returned to Taiwan. She was appointed the Secretary-General of the Republic of China Track and Field Association in 1977. Subsequently, she was Chairman until 1993 and Board Member from 1998 to 1999. Chi won three terms as a member of the Legislative Yuan, serving from 1981 to 1989.

She was appointed a National Policy Advisor by President Ma Ying-jeou in 2009, which required her to renounce her U.S. citizenship in order to take the position. Ma&#x27;s successor, Tsai Ing-wen, retained Chi as an advisor.

Chi stated in 2018 that Taiwanese people should be allowed to vote for the name under which Taiwanese athletes compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics and future sports events, as Taiwanese as sent delegations to the Olympics since 1984 as Chinese Taipei.

<text>Lewis Shepard Stone (November 15, 1879 – September 12, 1953) was an American film actor. He spent 29 years as a contract player at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was best known for his portrayal of Judge James Hardy in the studio&#x27;s popular &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; film series. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1929 for his performance as Russian Count Pahlen in &quot;The Patriot&quot;. Stone was also cast in seven films with Greta Garbo, including in the role of Doctor Otternschlag in the 1932 drama &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;.

== Early life ==
Stone was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1879, was youngest of four children of Philena (née Ball) and Bertrand Stone. His father, according to the federal census of 1880, supported the family as a boot cutter. After obtaining his public education in Worcester, Lewis joined the United States Army during the Spanish–American War, serving as a lieutenant and later being deployed to China to train troops. He returned to the United States, and following his discharge from the army began his career as a writer and actor.

== Career ==

In the early-1900s Stone was considered by the critics to be the most popular leading man in stock in America. For eight years, he held the role as leading man with the Oliver Morosco Stock Company in Los Angeles.

In 1912, Stone found success in the popular play &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot;, which starred Laurette Taylor. The play was later filmed in 1932 and 1951.

For the summer of 1913 Stone appeared at Elitch Theatre in Denver, Colorado, as the leading man for the season. The proprietor of the theatre, Mary Elitch Long, recalled an event when Stone heard of a nearby family in need and he &quot;went to a neighborhood grocery and, placing $25.00 on the counter, told the storekeeper to see to it that the bereaved little family wanted for nothing; and to let him know when more money was needed and to say nothing about it.&quot;

His career was interrupted by a return to the Army in World War I, serving as a major in the cavalry.

Before leaving for the war he made his feature film debut in &quot;Honor&#x27;s Altar&quot; in 1916. He showed up in First National&#x27;s 1920 &quot;Nomads of the North&quot; to good effect playing a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman. He portrayed the title role in the 1922 silent film version of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.

From 1920 to 1927, he lived in Los Angeles at 212 S. Wilton Place. The home is now Los Angeles Cultural-Historic Monument #925 and is in the Wilton Historic District.

In 1924, he joined newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio and was contracted by it up until his death.

Stone was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1929 for &quot;The Patriot&quot;. He played the character that gives the film its title, but he was not the top-billed star. He appeared in seven films with Greta Garbo, spanning both the silent and early sound periods. He played the role of Dr. Otternschlag in the Garbo film &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, in which he utters the famous closing line &quot;Grand Hotel. People coming. Going. Nothing ever happens.&quot;

He played a larger role in the 1933 Garbo film &quot;Queen Christina&quot;. His appearance in the successful prison film &quot;The Big House&quot; furthered his career. He played adventurers in the dinosaur epic &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925) with Wallace Beery and &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932) with Boris Karloff, and a police captain in &quot;Bureau of Missing Persons&quot; (1933).

In 1937, Stone got the role which became his most famous, that of honest and kind-hearted Judge James Hardy in the &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; film series, starring Mickey Rooney. Stone appeared as the judge in 14 of the 16 Hardy movies, beginning with &quot;You&#x27;re Only Young Once&quot; (1937). Lionel Barrymore had played the judge in the first Hardy movie, and Stone died before the making of the last one, &quot;Andy Hardy Comes Home&quot; (1958), so the judge&#x27;s own death was mentioned in the film. During the heyday of the series, Stone also appeared with Rooney in the short subject &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, which promoted charitable donations to the Community Chest.

During World War II, the 60-plus year-old Stone was a lieutenant colonel in the California National Guard.

Stone was MGM&#x27;s longest-contracted actor and the longest-ever-contracted actor at a studio up to his death. The week before his death, he (together with Lionel Barrymore) received a gold key to his dressing room. He made approximately 100 movies.

== Personal life ==
Stone owned a beach house in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles. In 1930 the oil drilling boom in the Venice Beach-Del Ray oil field caused him to file a lawsuit to stop the beach lease in order to prevent property damage and public nuisance. &quot;The court ruled for Stone even though derricks ringed the beach ...&quot;

In the 1930s he owned a 104-foot luxury yacht named &quot;Serena&quot;. In 1937 the yacht was sold to Robert Paine Scripps (the father of Charles Scripps) and converted to a research vessel named the &quot;E. W. Scripps&quot;.

Stone campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in 1932.

== Death ==
Stone died in Hancock Park, Los Angeles on September 12, 1953, aged 73. He reportedly suffered a heart attack while chasing away some neighborhood kids who were throwing rocks at his garage or trampling his meticulously kept prized garden. Another published report states that on that date Stone and his third wife were watching television when they heard a racket in the back yard. When he investigated, Stone found lawn furniture once again floating in the pool and glimpsed three or perhaps four teenage boys running toward the street. Stone gave chase despite his wife&#x27;s warning not to exert himself. Upon reaching the sidewalk, Stone suddenly collapsed. A gardener, Juan Vergara, witnessed the chase and summoned aid.

A photo published in newspapers of the day showed Stone lying on the sidewalk immediately after the incident. The photo was later included in Kenneth Anger&#x27;s book of scandals titled &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;.

Lewis Stone was later honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6524 Hollywood Blvd.

<text>Alexander Isaakovich Shlyakhter (; died June 2000) was a Russian nuclear physicist and risk analyst.

Shlyakhter is best known for discovering empirical evidence for the constancy of fundamental constants. While still a student in Leningrad, he observed that the products of past nuclear reactions at a natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, Gabon demonstrate that the fine-structure constant α has changed less than 10−17 per year over the last two billion years. He published the finding in a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; in 1976. Freeman Dyson later wrote that Shlyakhter had &quot;revolutionized the subject&quot; of variation in physical constants.

In 1987 Shlyakhter became a research fellow in Richard Wilson&#x27;s laboratory at Harvard University. His later work was in risk assessment, and included notable analyses of global warming, nuclear security and the Chernobyl disaster. He died of cancer in June 2000.

<text>White Pony is the third studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones, released on June 20, 2000, through Maverick Records. It was produced by Terry Date, who produced the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Adrenaline&quot; (1995) and &quot;Around the Fur&quot; (1997). Recording sessions took place between August and December 1999 at Larrabee Sound Studios in West Hollywood and The Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, California.

The album marked a significant growth in the band&#x27;s sound, incorporating influences from post-hardcore, trip hop, shoegaze, progressive rock, and post-rock into the alternative metal sound which they had become known for. &quot;White Pony&quot; was also the first recording to feature Frank Delgado as a full-time member of the band on turntables and synthesizer; Delgado had previously worked with the band as a featured guest on their first two albums, producing sound effects on some songs. It was also the first Deftones album on which Chino Moreno began to contribute rhythm guitar parts.

Upon its release and retrospectively, the album was met with critical acclaim, and is regarded by fans and critics alike as one of the band&#x27;s most mature outings at that point. The album includes two successful singles (&quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; and &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot;), the promotional single &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, as well as the 2001 Grammy Award-winning track for Best Metal Performance, &quot;Elite&quot;. The album received a 20th anniversary reissue, packaged with &quot;Black Stallion&quot;, a companion remix album of &quot;White Pony&quot;, in December 2020.

==Background and recording==
After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording &quot;White Pony&quot; with the producer Terry Date, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. The singer Chino Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of &quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; was the turning point where the band began working as a unit.

Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. The bassist Chi Cheng explained, &quot;We didn&#x27;t feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make.&quot; Moreno did not have an overall lyrical theme in mind, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining, &quot;I basically didn&#x27;t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things. Once I did that I was able to sing about anything I wanted to, I could be a lot more general. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff on this record that people are going to question me about, and I can just remove myself from it. It&#x27;s not me. I&#x27;m writing a story here.&quot; Moreno later claimed in a 2020 interview that his decision to play rhythm guitar on the album caused tensions to escalate with the guitarist Stephen Carpenter during the writing process. Despite the tensions, Moreno and Carpenter found themselves on friendlier terms and found a cohesive songwriting process for most of the album&#x27;s tracks, with Moreno claiming, &quot;Initially, I don&#x27;t think the idea was that I was going to actually play on the record, even. Then I remember Stephen specifically saying, &#x27;Dude, if you&#x27;re going to play it in practice, then you&#x27;re going to play on the record!&#x27; and I was like, &#x27;Oh, okay… If that&#x27;s cool with you!&#x27; I don&#x27;t think he was too happy about it, to be honest, then [...] I do remember us both smiling at each other when we were sitting listening to the track being made, and the fusing of both our guitars, the sound of it, the way that Terry [Date] produced it.&quot;

Although the band initially did not intend to include guest musicians on the album, it features additional vocals by the Tool and A Perfect Circle singer Maynard James Keenan on &quot;Passenger&quot; and Rodleen Getsic (simply credited as Rodleen) on &quot;Knife Prty&quot;. &quot;Rx Queen&quot; also features vocal contributions from the Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, though he is uncredited. Weiland brought Moreno to his studio for collaboration, where he would sing along and suggest vocal harmonies; the result was left in the final version of the song, and credit for Weiland&#x27;s part was never discussed by either party.

==Composition==
Stylistically, &quot;White Pony&quot; combines the band&#x27;s standard alternative metal sound, influenced by bands such as Tool, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, and Pink Floyd, with the layered atmospherics of the Cure, specifically their &quot;Pornography&quot; era. It has also been categorized as an art rock and nu metal album, though several critics also acknowledge that the record moved beyond the latter label. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; likened the album to a metal version of Radiohead&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). Moreno discussed the lyrics to the original opener for the album, &quot;Feiticeira&quot;: &quot;The name Feiticeira is some Portuguese name that I read in a magazine and just liked. It&#x27;s based on the scenario of being taken captive. It&#x27;s completely fictional. I want that people who listen to it feel like they are the ones in the situation. Because of that I sing it in first person. It&#x27;s up to people to figure out if i&#x27;m having fun (with them) or not, even though it sounds a bit eerie&quot;.

&quot;Elite&quot; is more straightforward and heavy and lacks typical Deftones dynamics, containing industrial rock influences. Moreno said that the song &quot;is laughing at everybody trying to become what they already are. If you want to be one of the elite, you are&quot;. Moreno considers &quot;Rx Queen&quot; &quot;the most futuristic song in the album&quot;. About &quot;Street Carp&quot;, Moreno said: &quot;It&#x27;s a classic Deftones song, with a rolling riff and some really interesting chords in the chorus. The vocals are kinda crazy - I&#x27;m singing out loud over the top of the music, like (the Smiths singer) Morrissey or something, a cool contrast&quot;. Although the song was not released as a single, a promo video was made for it. Moreno stated that he wrote the lyrics to &quot;Teenager&quot; when he was 15 after a first date and that it was originally a Team Sleep song.

Moreno said about &quot;Knife Prty&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a seductive song with a lot of violent imagery. People don&#x27;t tend to like sex mixed with violence. The mid section has amazing vocals from a girl called Rodleen who worked next door to our studio&quot;. &quot;Passenger&quot; features a guitar intro and vocal interplay between Maynard James Keenan and Moreno alongside piano and keyboard lines, leading to heavy guitar that introduces the choruses.

&quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single, and became a radio hit. Moreno compared it to earlier single &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot;, considering it &quot;a beautiful metamorphosis&quot;. The closer, &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; is a &quot;brooding, surreal epic&quot; which ends with a recorded heartbeat. The title is a reference to a line in the Dr. Dooom song &quot;No Chorus&quot; on the album &quot;First Come, First Served&quot; which mocks Nas. Leading off the reissued version of the album, &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot; is a reinterpretation of the album&#x27;s closer with additional rap or hip hop influences. Moreno at first appreciated the support the band received from the label as a result of recording the track, but later declared that he regretted the creation of the song and its placement on the album. &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Republic&quot; is a song exclusive to the limited-edition releases of the album, with lyrics about someone desperately seeking redemption, and comes after &quot;Pink Maggit,&quot; making it the final track on the limited edition.

==Album title==
&quot;White pony&quot; is street slang for cocaine. However, there are other meanings for the album name, including a sexual reference, as explained by Moreno:

:&quot;There&#x27;s a lot of different references for &quot;White Pony&quot;. One of them is a cocaine reference and there&#x27;s a lot of stuff... have you ever heard stuff like in dream books that if you dream about a white pony, then you&#x27;re having a sexual dream? There&#x27;s a lot of stuff that kinda goes around it. And there&#x27;s an old song [that goes], &#x27;Ride the white horse.&#x27; That&#x27;s obviously a drug-reference song.&quot;

==Release==
Upon release, &quot;White Pony&quot; debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 below Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;, selling 178,000 copies in its first week. It is Deftones&#x27; highest-selling album to date, being certified gold on September 7, 2000, and eventually the album became their first platinum record certified by the RIAA on July 17, 2002. The album was also certified gold in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Five different editions of the album exist. On its release date, limited-edition numbered copies were released with solid red and black jewel cases. The two differently colored cases also featured different booklet inserts. Both limited-edition versions included &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Republic&quot; but not &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit).&quot; The edition with a gray cover was released as the initial non-limited version of the album and did not include &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Republic&quot;. This, along with the red and black versions, were the properly sequenced version of the album as the band intended. The gray version was later superseded by the current white version, which added &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot; as the first track. This was only added as a marketing strategy, a decision that Moreno stated that he was unhappy with. The original release was also pressed on clear red vinyl for a promotional run of about 1,000 copies.

In honor of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Deftones re-released &quot;White Pony&quot; on December 11, 2020, packaged with &quot;Black Stallion&quot;, a bonus remix album. &quot;Black Stallion&quot; features the full track list of the original &quot;White Pony&quot; album in order with each song recreated by a different producer with an &quot;electronic, beat-driven&quot; approach. Deftones originally conceived of doing a remix album prior to the recording of &quot;White Pony&quot; and had reached out to DJ Shadow to remix the entire album himself. &quot;Black Stallion&quot; includes remixes from DJ Shadow, Clams Casino, Robert Smith, Mike Shinoda and more; and was promoted with a music video for Purity Ring&#x27;s remix of &quot;Knife Prty&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;White Pony&quot; received widespread acclaim by critics, garnering an aggregate rating of 72 on Metacritic. Several reviewers praised Moreno&#x27;s increasing lyrical sophistication and the group&#x27;s sonic experimentation.

&quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, though it cautioned that &quot;the band&#x27;s continuous inclination toward a bludgeoning experimental sonic attack and Moreno&#x27;s violent, impressionistic lyrics made the album a tough pill to swallow for most listeners&quot;. Similarly, BBC Music praised the album while opining: &quot;[The fact] that such a progressive, risk-taking LP wasn&#x27;t celebrated across the board for its gutsy reinventing of a band thought pigeonholed wasn&#x27;t that surprising, though – this is a difficult album.&quot; In a favorable review, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; noted the album&#x27;s &quot;art-rock explorations.&quot; Publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; were somewhat less enthusiastic. The former lamented that the album was overproduced to sound too much like their influencers, while the latter wondered if &quot;White Pony&quot; was &quot;their most adventurous and assured album to date&quot;.

In 2016, Jonathan Dick of NPR Music retrospectively praised the album as a watershed moment or turning point, not only in regards to the Deftones&#x27; sound but also, more generally, to heavy and experimental music in the new millennium, describing the album as signaling &quot;not only a change for the band but a new trajectory for heavy and experimental music entering the 21st century&quot;. Dick especially noted the album&#x27;s &quot;shift into the heavy post-rock, shoegaze spectrum&quot; and contended that, within the span of five years from the band&#x27;s debut album to the release of &quot;White Pony&quot;, Deftones had distinguished itself as a band &quot;whose sound no longer fit too comfortably under any genre-specific title&quot;. Similarly, Mike Diver of &quot;Clash magazine&quot; asserted that &quot;White Pony&quot; &quot;changed everything – not just for Deftones, but metal as a whole&quot;, noting the album&#x27;s &quot;distinct air of progressive rock&quot; and its ability to weave electronics into aggressive yet reflective songs. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; retrospectively noted that &quot;White Pony&quot; &quot;transcended the dubious genre [of nu-metal] by fashioning a truly new form from post-hardcore, industrial, trip-hop, shoegaze, ambient electronics, and synth-pop.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;White Pony&quot; as the second best album of 2000, and in their September 2010 issue, placed it in their list of the &quot;Top 10 Most Influential Albums of 2000&quot;. UK rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named &quot;White Pony&quot; their third best album of the year behind Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s &quot;Rated R&quot; and At the Drive-In&#x27;s &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;. In 2011, Complex Media Network&#x27;s music website, Consequence of Sound, honored &quot;White Pony&quot; on a &quot;List &#x27;Em Carefully&quot; installment dedicated to writer David Buchanan&#x27;s top 13 metal records released between 2000 and 2010, noting that Deftones was one of several acts who &quot;helped usher the popularity of complex structure meets MTV audience&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;White Pony&quot; as 66th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27; In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it 29th on their list of &#x27;The 100 best albums of the 21st century&#x27;. In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

The album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Elite&quot;, won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2001. The Deftones drummer Abe Cunningham commented on the awards night: &quot;All the people were on the ground, on the floor, and we were up sort of in the balcony, we were like, &#x27;We&#x27;re not gonna win. Look where we&#x27;re sitting.&#x27; Everybody else who was winning, they&#x27;d get up there quick and get back. So we were just watching it and the whole thing was rad, just seeing the (stuff) go down. And all of a sudden they called our name. We just jumped over this balcony down onto the floor and ran up there. It was pretty cool, man&quot;.

The album won the 2000 Kerrang! Award for Album of the Year.

At the 2001 California Music Awards, it won Outstanding Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album.

<doc id="142795" wikidata="Q311409" url="?curid=142795" title="Franz Danzi">
<text>Franz Ignaz Danzi (15 June 1763 – 13 April 1826) was a German cellist, composer and conductor, the son of the Italian cellist Innocenz Danzi (1730–1798) and brother of the noted singer Franzeska Danzi. 

Danzi lived at a significant time in the history of European music. His career, spanning the transition from the late Classical to the early Romantic styles, coincided with the origin of much of the music that lives in our concert halls and is familiar to contemporary classical-music audiences. In his youth he knew Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom he revered; he was a contemporary of Ludwig van Beethoven, about whom he — like many of his generation — had strong but mixed feelings and he was a mentor for the young Carl Maria von Weber, whose music he respected and promoted. 

==Life and career==

Born in Schwetzingen and raised in Mannheim, Danzi studied with his father and with Georg Joseph Vogler before he joined the superlative orchestra of the Elector Karl Theodor in 1778 as a teenager. 

In 1780, the first of his woodwind compositions was published at Mannheim. His father, principal cellist of the orchestra, was praised by Mozart for his playing at the premiere of &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. Danzi remained behind in a Mannheim that was rendered more provincial when Karl Theodor moved his court to Munich in 1778. After an apprenticeship with the small theatre orchestra left in Mannheim, he rejoined the main court in Munich as principal cellist — taking his father&#x27;s position — in 1784.

In 1790, he married the singer and composer Maria Margarethe Marchand, with whom he travelled in an opera troupe to Leipzig, Prague, Venice, and Florence.

By 1798, once more in Munich, he rose to the position of assistant Kapellmeister in one of the most important musical centers of Europe. In 1807, unhappy at the treatment he received at court and despairing of any further advancement, he left Munich to be Kapellmeister in the smaller and less important Stuttgart court of the new king of Württemberg, Frederick I, where he supported and influenced the work of Carl Maria von Weber. 

In 1812, he moved again to Karlsruhe, where he spent the last years of his life at the Royal Konservatorium struggling to raise the modest courtly musical establishment to respectability.

==Death==
On April 13, 1826, he died in Karlsruhe, aged 62.

==Contribution==
Danzi is known today chiefly for his woodwind quintets, in which he took justifiable pride for the idiomatic treatment of the individual instruments. He composed in most major genres of the time, including opera, church music, orchestral works, and many varieties of chamber music. He was a first-rate cellist as well as a conscientious and — by all reports — effective orchestra leader and conductor.

At Schwetzingen, the city concert hall was renamed in his honour in 2005.

==Selected works==

* &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot; in E major for Wind Quintet and Orchestra (1785)

<doc id="142796" wikidata="Q1210245" url="?curid=142796" title="Around the Fur">
<text>Around the Fur is the second studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones, released on October 28, 1997, by Maverick Records. The songs &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot; and &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot; were released as singles with accompanying music videos. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in 1999, and was later certified platinum in 2011.

==Background==
&quot;Around the Fur&quot; has been described as alternative metal, nu metal, and post-hardcore. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter has since reflected, &quot;We didn&#x27;t really pay much attention to that. I remember when these subgenre names didn&#x27;t exist. It was just metal. So I don&#x27;t think we made a decision to step away [from nu metal] – we&#x27;ve never paid attention to what anyone else was doing. We just did what we thought was right, and tried to make a killer album.&quot; The producer Terry Date stated that the band wanted to become &quot;more sophisticated&quot; with &quot;Around the Fur&quot;. Lyrically, much of the album addresses topics such as juvenile perception, existential angst, sex, romance, violence, the death of loved ones, and break-ups.

Recording took place between April 1997 and June 1997 at Studio Litho in Seattle, which was owned by Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam. At that time, Pearl Jam were working on their fifth studio album &quot;Yield&quot;, and had to use a different studio. The band had gathered inspiration off of their own internal issues and personal incidents, as the four of them rented an apartment in Southern Seattle whilst they were writing and recording the album. The singer Chino Moreno and Carpenter recall the band often drank and partied frequently, even recalling random moments of writing where the bassist Chi Cheng and Carpenter would smoke marijuana frequently together and write riffs together; the two later included their voicemail of them smoking out of a bong as a hidden track between &quot;MX&quot; and &quot;Damone&quot;.

It was the second album to feature Frank Delgado under additional personnel; he eventually joined the band officially in 1999. The song &quot;Headup&quot; featured additional vocals by Max Cavalera of Soulfly.

The album cover was shot by the photographer Rick Kosick during a late-night party in Seattle where the band was recording. Upon seeing the candid photo of a woman, the band decided that they wanted to use it as the album cover. Kosick was unsure who the woman was, so the band had to find and track her down to obtain permission to use the photo, which she eventually granted. The woman appearing on the cover is Lisa M. Hughes, a friend of Stephen Carpenter. Hughes spoke publicly about the cover for the first time during the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2017. Moreno has since expressed his dislike of the cover, calling it &quot;horrible&quot;.

==Composition and lyrics==
In a 1998 interview with &quot;Chart&quot; magazine, Moreno commented, &quot;When we went in to make this record, we really didn&#x27;t have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with.&quot; However, he felt that the album &quot;fell into place&quot; once the band had settled into the studio. The band expanded its sound, spending more time with the producer Terry Date, and giving more thought to the album&#x27;s production. Abe Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drums on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno&#x27;s unusual vocals, and the strong rhythm section grooves created by Cunningham and Cheng.

==Release==
The album was highly anticipated, and propelled the band to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot; and &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track was also released as a promotional single. 
&quot;Around the Fur&quot; sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 29 (its peak position), remaining on the chart for 17 weeks. &quot;Around the Fur&quot; went on to reach RIAA gold status on June 24, 1999, and platinum status on June 7, 2011.

When the album was released on Spotify, it contained an alternate version of &quot;Headup&quot; running a full minute longer than the original release.

===Touring===
In May 1997, while &quot;Around the Fur&quot; was in the process of being recorded, the band performed two concerts at Bojangles in Sacramento. These were their first shows since December 1996, with the band debuting several &quot;Around the Fur&quot; songs that were still in the demo stages. Their next performance was on September 11, 1997, at The Press Club in San Francisco. This concert saw the debut of live staples &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot; and &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s release in October 1997, Deftones toured North America/Europe with the Sacramento bands Far and Will Haven. The tour continued into early 1998. Later in 1998, they made appearances at the Warped Tour (in the United States, New Zealand and Australia), Pinkpop Festival, Roskilde Festival and Ozzfest, as well as releasing a live EP on April 10, 1998. In September 1998, Deftones toured with Red Hot Chili Peppers, who were playing their first shows in over six years with the guitarist John Frusciante.

==Critical reception==
The album generally received positive reviews from music critics. Greg Corrao of CMJ New Music Monthly remarked in November 1997, &quot;This hard-hitting noise-fest finds the band once again furthering the cause of riff-heavy, bludgeoning rock also championed by the likes of Soundgarden, Helmet and Kyuss&quot;, further adding that, &quot;Those heavy sensibilities are paired with vocalist Chino Moreno&#x27;s yearning whine, allowing the band to create [their] own kind of sub-metal.&quot; He concluded his review by asserting that, &quot;With &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, Deftones have carved out their own place in heavy music&#x27;s hard beaten path toward the year 2000.&quot; In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Deftones tap into the same alternative metal vibe as Korn and L7, and while they don&#x27;t have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, &quot;Around the Fur&quot; suggests they&#x27;re about to come into their own&quot;. James P. Wisdom of Pitchfork described the songs from the album as &quot;intense, harsh tunes&quot;, while Punknews.org thought that the album &quot;showcased a band aware of their flaws, structure and lyrical approach, and thus achieved an overall great improvement in said areas&quot;. Robert Christgau was less receptive, dismissing it as a &quot;dud&quot;.

In 2015, the critic Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of Diffuser stated that &quot;[o]n their landmark second album, Deftones infused elements of new wave and shoegaze to define their future direction. Alt-metal would never be the same.&quot; Reyes-Kulkarni observed that the album &quot;captures the first full blossoming of the duality that has come to define the Sacramento quintet&#x27;s musical identity&quot; and &quot;set a new standard for &#x27;90s alt-metal and opened doors to what&#x27;s possible when bands find the motivation to get heavy away from the brutish impulses that typically drive aggressive music.&quot; He further noted that, while the album &quot;sounds undeniably thicker and heavier&quot; than the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, Chino Moreno&#x27;s new wave and post-punk influences became increasingly evident: &quot;On &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, Moreno&#x27;s love of new wave groups like Depeche Mode and the Cure began to rear its head in earnest.&quot;

At the 1998 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards, &quot;Around the Fur&quot; won the award for &quot;Best Album&quot;. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it as one of the ten best albums released in 1997. They also listed it as being one of the best metal albums released between 1996 and 1997. In 2017, &quot;Loudwire&quot; named it as the third best hard rock album of 1997. When &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked the eight albums Deftones had released as of May 2020, &quot;Around the Fur&quot; was placed at number four.

In 2021, Moreno said that &quot;Around The Fur&quot; is his favorite Deftones album.

<text>Adrenaline is the debut studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones, released on October 3, 1995, by Maverick Records. The majority of the album was produced by Terry Date, while a hidden track titled &quot;Fist&quot; was produced by Ross Robinson.

==Background and recording==
Stephen Carpenter, Abe Cunningham and Chino Moreno were high school friends. All three went to Sacramento&#x27;s C. K. McClatchy High School together, and participated in the city&#x27;s skateboarding scene. Carpenter was a fan of heavy metal; Moreno was interested in hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains as well as post-punk and new wave bands such as Depeche Mode and the Cure. When Moreno learned that Carpenter was a guitarist, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums. The trio began playing regularly in Carpenter&#x27;s garage around 1988. They recruited bassist Dominic Garcia some time after, and the band became a four-piece. When Cunningham left Deftones to join Phallucy, another band from Sacramento, Garcia switched instruments and became the band&#x27;s drummer. Chi Cheng filled the void as bassist, and the band recorded a four-track demo soon afterwards. Cunningham then returned to the band on drums, replacing Garcia.

Regarding the recording, Cunningham said, &quot;At the time we did the first record – which I really like and think is good – you can tell the band was really young. We&#x27;d been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn&#x27;t really think a whole lot about making the songs better&quot;. Moreno felt that &quot;Adrenaline&quot; was recorded &quot;really fast&quot;, and he performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone.

Although not specifically credited in the album&#x27;s liner notes, it was stated that Frank Delgado contributed to the songs &quot;Minus Blindfold&quot; and &quot;Fireal&quot;. He was later credited on Deftones&#x27; subsequent album &quot;Around the Fur&quot; as a guest, followed by becoming an official member in 1999.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Adrenaline&quot; has been described as nu metal, post-hardcore, alternative metal, and rap rock.

==Promotion==
&quot;7 Words&quot; was released as the first promotional single from the album in 1995. It was followed by &quot;Bored&quot;, issued as the second promotional single in 1996. Music videos were released for &quot;7 Words&quot; and &quot;Bored&quot;. The song &quot;Engine No. 9&quot; was also featured in the film &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot;.

Deftones performed heavily throughout North America to support the album, going on tours with Handsome, Korn, White Zombie and Super 8 (whose vocalist helped discover Deftones). They also opened for Kiss on their Alive/Worldwide Tour.

==Reception==
&quot;Adrenaline&quot; was praised for its new, innovative sound, with critics initially comparing it to a diverse range of acts such as Helmet, Nine Inch Nails, the Cure, Korn, Nirvana, and the Smashing Pumpkins. In his 1995 review, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s Paul Brannigan felt the album&#x27;s sound &quot;falls between Quicksand and Tool&quot;, and said Deftones &quot;explode from atmospheric croons into buck-mad rages&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Excellent production from Terry Date allows the crisp guitar on &#x27;Lifter&#x27; and &#x27;7 Words&#x27; to shine&quot;, and that &quot;Bored&quot; and &quot;Nosebleed&quot; are &quot;just as blunt and angry, slabs of guitar crashing down on swirling, hypnotic rhythms.&quot; Brannigan rated it 4 out of 5 stars, saying it was &quot;Impressive.&quot; In 1995, Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Pulse!&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Adrenaline&quot; pitches between gloom-saturated melodies and explosive riffs, lashing out like a sleep-deprived paranoiac awakened by noisy neighbors. The rhythms are crisp and crafty and the vocals resonate both fury and sensitivity in a way that&#x27;s similar to, but far more blatantly metallic than Nirvana&quot;. Critic Katherine Turman wrote for &quot;Car Audio&quot; magazine in January 1996, &quot;If this is what heavy metal is evolving into, it&#x27;s a damn good thing&quot;.

Giving the album 3 out of 4 stars in her 1996 review, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Sandy Masuo praised the album&#x27;s nuance and blend of musical extremes and various influences: &quot;On the outside, Sacramento&#x27;s Deftones are all pummeling rhythms and high anxiety, but delving further into the music turns up some surprising nuances: traces of post-punk pop, tinges of rap, a pinch of industrial grit. Chino Moreno rants, sobs, croons and even works some Middle Eastern overtones into his vocals, while Stephen Carpenter&#x27;s guitar shifts from coarse outbursts to crisp Helmet-ine precision. A bracing blend of extremes&quot;. In his 1996 review, Tomas Pascual of &quot;Livewire&quot; magazine similarly noted the album&#x27;s subtle yet diverse musical influences and the juxtaposition of loud and heavy with soft and melodic: &quot;There are many bands these days that lay claim to a diverse section of influences. But no one band is as subtly boisterous about their eclectic mix as are Deftones. [...] Deftones&#x27; course is piloted by vocalist and frontman Chino Moreno, who expresses his smooth, melodic lyrics emotionally one minute before giving way to abrasive, maddened screams the next. Backed by the serene and apocalyptic guitar of Stephen Carpenter, this Yin-Yang formula keeps Deftones&#x27; debut &quot;Adrenaline&quot; progressively contagious&quot;.

===Retrospective reviews===
In a retrospective AllMusic review of the album, Daniel Gioffre wrote, &quot;Unlike many of their contemporaries, Deftones are very controlled even in the midst of chaos&quot;, adding, &quot;Throw Abe Cunningham&#x27;s surprisingly sophisticated drumming into the mix, and you have a band that possesses a far greater degree of nuance than most others that work in the genre&quot;. While he noted that &quot;there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno&#x27;s whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit&quot;, Gioffre ultimately states that &quot;[o]n later albums, the band&#x27;s progressive tendencies become more developed, but the more straight-ahead material on Adrenaline does not disappoint. A promising debut.&quot; In the book &quot;The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal&quot;, author Essi Berelian wrote that the album &quot;still stands as one of the best examples of nu-metal&quot;. Writing for MetalSucks in June 2009, Carlos Ramirez noted that the wide range of musical influences in both &quot;Adrenaline&quot; and &quot;Around the Fur&quot; helped to establish the band in the underground music scene prior to their larger commercial breakthrough with their third album, &quot;White Pony&quot;: &quot;[Deftones&#x27;] first two albums, &quot;Adrenaline&quot; (1995) and &quot;Around the Fur&quot; (1997), were both chock full of bombastic guitars, new wave-kissed vocal lines, and post-hardcore informed arrangements, and their wide-scoped sound helped the Sacramento, CA band find audiences in various facets of the underground music scene&quot;. In critic Tim Karan&#x27;s 20th anniversary assessment for &quot;Diffuser&quot;, he wrote: &quot;For those who were swept up in the burgeoning nu-metal movement, &#x27;Adrenaline&#x27; was a landmark, life-changing release. But Deftones never really were a true nu-metal band -- this album is more like hardcore-influenced post-hardcore than &#x27;Nookie&#x27; -- and it only scratched at the surface of the experimental metal Deftones would soon step into&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
While the album was initially unsuccessful, extensive touring and word-of-mouth promotion built the band a dedicated fanbase and helped &quot;Adrenaline&quot; to sell over 220,000 copies. When asked what he attributed the album&#x27;s success to, bassist Chi Cheng responded, &quot;One word: perseverance. We&#x27;ve been together for almost eight years, on the road for two and we do it with honesty and integrity – and the kids can tell&quot;. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on July 7, 1999, in recognition of 500,000 units sold. It was eventually certified platinum on September 23, 2008, in recognition of 1,000,000 units sold.

<text>A web directory or link directory is an online list or catalog of websites. That is, it is a directory on the World Wide Web of (all or part of) the World Wide Web. Historically, directories typically listed entries on people or businesses, and their contact information; such directories are still in use today. A web directory includes entries about websites, including links to those websites, organized into categories and subcategories. Besides a link, each entry may include the title of the website, and a description of its contents. In most web directories, the entries are about whole websites, rather than individual pages within them (called &quot;deep links&quot;). Websites are often limited to inclusion in only a few categories.

There are two ways to find information on the Web: by searching or browsing. Web directories provide links in a structured list to make browsing easier. Many web directories combine searching and browsing by providing a search engine to search the directory. Unlike search engines, which base results on a database of entries gathered automatically by web crawler, most web directories are built manually by human editors. Many web directories allow site owners to submit their site for inclusion, and have editors review submissions for fitness.

Web directories may be general in scope, or limited to particular subjects or fields. Entries may be listed for free, or by paid submission (meaning the site owner must pay to have his or her website listed).

RSS directories are similar to web directories, but contain collections of RSS feeds, instead of links to websites.

==History==
During the early development of the web, there was a list of web servers edited by Tim Berners-Lee and hosted on the CERN webserver. One historical snapshot from 1992 remains. He also created the World Wide Web Virtual Library, which is the oldest web directory.

===Scope of listing===
Most of the directories are general in on scope and list websites across a wide range of categories, regions and languages. But some niche directories focus on restricted regions, single languages, or specialist sectors. For example, there are shopping directories that specialize in the listing of retail e-commerce sites.

Examples of well-known general web directories are Yahoo! Directory (shut down at the end of 2014) and DMOZ (shut down on March 14, 2017). DMOZ was significant due to its extensive categorization and large number of listings and its free availability for use by other directories and search engines.

However, a debate over the quality of directories and databases still continues, as search engines use DMOZ&#x27;s content without real integration, and some experiment using clustering.

=== Development ===

There have been many attempts to make building web directories easier, such as using automated submission of related links by script, or any number of available PHP portals and programs. Recently, social software techniques have spawned new efforts of categorization, with Amazon.com adding tagging to their product pages.

== Monetizing ==
Directories have various features in their listings, often depending upon the price paid for inclusion:
* Cost
** Free submission – there is no charge for the review and listing of the site
** Paid submission – a one-time or recurring fee is charged for reviewing/listing the submitted link
* No follow – there is a codice_1 attribute associated with the link, meaning search engines will give no weight to the link
* Featured listing – the link is given a premium position in a category (or multiple categories) or other sections of the directory, such as the homepage. Sometimes called sponsored listing.
* Bid for position – where sites are ordered based on bids
* Affiliate links – where the directory earns commission for referred customers from the listed websites
* Reciprocity
** Reciprocal link – a link back to the directory must be added somewhere on the submitted site in order to get listed in the directory. This strategy has decreased in popularity due to changes in SEO algorithms which can make it less valuable or counterproductive.
** No Reciprocal link – a web directory where you will submit your links for free and no need to add link back to your website

==Human-edited web directories==

A human-edited directory is created and maintained by editors who add links based on the policies particular to that directory.
Human-edited directories are often targeted by SEOs on the basis that links from reputable sources will improve rankings in the major search engines. Some directories may prevent search engines from rating a displayed link by using redirects, nofollow attributes, or other techniques. Many human-edited directories, including DMOZ, World Wide Web Virtual Library, Business.com and Jasmine Directory, are edited by volunteers, who are often experts in particular categories. These directories are sometimes criticized due to long delays in approving submissions, or for rigid organizational structures and disputes among volunteer editors.

In response to these criticisms, some volunteer-edited directories have adopted wiki technology, to allow broader community participation in editing the directory (at the risk of introducing lower-quality, less objective entries).

Another direction taken by some web directories is the paid for inclusion model. This method enables the directory to offer timely inclusion for submissions and generally fewer listings as a result of the paid model. They often offer additional listing options to further enhance listings, including features listings and additional links to inner pages of the listed website. These options typically have an additional fee associated but offer significant help and visibility to sites and/or their inside pages.

Today submission of websites to web directories is considered a common SEO (search engine optimization) technique to get back-links for the submitted website. One distinctive feature of &#x27;directory submission&#x27; is that it cannot be fully automated like search engine submissions. Manual directory submission is a tedious and time-consuming job and is often outsourced by webmasters.

==Bid for Position directories==

Bid for Position directories, also known as bidding web directories, are paid-for-inclusion web directories where the listings of websites in the directory are ordered according to their bid amount. They are special in that the more a person pays, the higher up the list of websites in the directory they go. With the higher listing, the website becomes more visible and increases the chances that visitors who browse the directory will click on the listing.

==Propagation==
Web directories will often make themselves accessing by more and more URLs by acquiring the domain registrations of defunct websites as soon as they expire, a practice known as Domain drop catching.

<doc id="142805" wikidata="Q180880" url="?curid=142805" title="Pantera">
<text>Pantera () is an American heavy metal band formed in Arlington, Texas in 1981 by the Abbott brothers (guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul), and currently composed of vocalist Phil Anselmo, bassist Rex Brown, and touring musicians Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante. The group&#x27;s best-known lineup consisted of the Abbott brothers along with Brown and Anselmo, who joined in 1982 and 1986, respectively. The band is credited for developing and popularizing the subgenre of groove metal in the 1990s. Regarded as one of the most successful and influential bands in heavy metal history, Pantera has sold around 20 million records worldwide and has received four Grammy nominations.

Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released three albums in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist Terry Glaze (&quot;Metal Magic&quot;, &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot;, and &quot;I Am the Night&quot;), with little success. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera recruited Anselmo in 1986 and released &quot;Power Metal&quot; in 1988. They secured a record deal with major label Atco the following year. Their fifth album (which the band has since declared to be their official debut album), 1990&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, popularized the groove metal genre, while its 1992 follow-up &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; achieved an even heavier sound and increased their popularity. The subsequent seventh studio album &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; (1994) debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Tensions began to surface among the band members when Anselmo, reeling from severe back problems brought on by years of intense on-stage performances, began growing distant from his bandmates in 1995, eventually becoming addicted to heroin as a result of his pain issues (he almost died from an overdose in July 1996). These tensions resulted in the recording sessions for &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; (1996) being held separately. The ongoing tension lasted for another seven years, during which one more studio album, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; (2000), was recorded. Pantera went on hiatus in 2001, but lingering disputes led to the band breaking up in 2003. The Abbott brothers went on to form Damageplan while Anselmo continued to work on several side projects, including Down, which Brown joined as well.

On December 8, 2004, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed on stage by a mentally unstable fan during a Damageplan concert in Columbus, Ohio. Vinnie Paul went on to form Hellyeah after his brother&#x27;s death, and died of heart failure in 2018, leaving Brown and Anselmo as the only surviving members of the band&#x27;s best-known lineup. In July 2022, it was announced that Brown and Anselmo were reuniting in 2023 for Pantera&#x27;s first tour in 22 years, with Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante filling in for the Abbott brothers on guitar and drums, respectively. The new lineup played its first show in 21 years at the Hell and Heaven festival in Mexico on December 2, 2022, and the tour has continued into 2025.

==History==
===1981–1986: Formation and early glam years===

The band was originally named Gemini, then Eternity, before finally settling on Pantera and consisted of Vinnie Paul Abbott on drums, Darrell Abbott on lead guitar, and Terry Glaze on rhythm guitar; the lineup was completed with two more members, lead vocalist Donny Hart and bassist Tommy D. Bradford. In 1982, Hart left the band and Glaze became the group&#x27;s lead vocalist. Later, Glaze stopped playing rhythm guitar, leaving Darrell as the sole guitarist, doing both lead and rhythm duties. Later that year, Bradford also departed and was replaced by Rex Brown (then known as Rex Rocker) on bass.

Pantera became an underground favorite, though its regional tours in this era never took them beyond Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. The band began supporting fellow heavy metal/glam metal acts such as Stryper, Dokken, and Quiet Riot. Pantera released their first studio album, &quot;Metal Magic&quot;, in 1983. &quot;Metal Magic&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s record label of the same name and produced by the Abbott brothers&#x27; father, Jerry Abbott, at Pantego Studios.

In 1984, Pantera released their second studio album, &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot;. Although still very much a glam metal album, the band members crafted songs that had less overbearing melodic influences than songs from the previous album. Another change was Terry Glaze&#x27;s name, as he was henceforth credited as &quot;Terrence Lee&quot;. In addition, a music video for the album&#x27;s lead track, &quot;All Over Tonight&quot;, was eventually created. &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot; was also released on the band&#x27;s independent Metal Magic Records label and produced by Jerry Abbott.

In 1985, Pantera released their third studio album, titled &quot;I Am the Night&quot;. As with &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot;, this album saw Pantera&#x27;s sound becoming heavier (though still rooted in glam metal), and the heavy metal press took more notice of the band. Because of poor distribution, &quot;I Am the Night&quot; turned out to be a costly album to many fans. Around 25,000 copies of the album were sold. Pantera&#x27;s second music video was produced for the track &quot;Hot and Heavy&quot;. By 1986, Glaze&#x27;s glam approach did not fit the band&#x27;s developing style, and he and the other members parted ways.

===1986–1989: Anselmo&#x27;s introduction and &quot;Power Metal&quot;===
Pantera began a search for Glaze&#x27;s replacement and initially auditioned Matt L&#x27;Amour, a David Coverdale lookalike. He sang a number of shows with the band in Los Angeles during the winter of 1986, but it became somewhat apparent that L&#x27;Amour could not hit the high notes Glaze was capable of. Together with his lack of stage presence, this meant that Pantera could only play cover songs, leading to L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s departure. Pantera next auditioned El Paso native Rick Mythiasin, later to sing for Steel Prophet and Agent Steel; however, cultural and image differences – Mythiasin failed to adapt to the Southern culture of the other members – meant his tenure was even shorter than that of L&#x27;Amour. A former schoolmate of the Abbott brothers, David Peacock of the band Forced Entry (who had supported Warlock), joined the band as lead vocalist in the spring of 1986, but despite Pantera doing most of the work for their fourth album during the summer with Peacock, Rex and the Abbotts found Peacock&#x27;s voice to be unsuited to the musical direction Pantera wished for. By the end of the year, Pantera even revisited original frontman Donny Hart, but Hart himself knew that he was not the right man Pantera were seeking and Jerry Abbott was to fire him.
During 1986, New Orleans native and then-eighteen year old Phil Anselmo had heard Pantera were looking for a singer. At the end of the year, they invited him to audition, and the eighteen-year old Anselmo was hired as the new vocalist on the spot. Anselmo had previously been the vocalist for the bands Samhain (not to be confused with Glenn Danzig&#x27;s band of the same name) and Razor White. Upon playing with Pantera, Anselmo immediately clicked with the other three members. The years 1986 and 1987 saw the release of several landmark thrash metal albums that would prove influential to Pantera&#x27;s developing musical style. Among the most prominent of these were Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;Among the Living,&quot; and Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;. When Anselmo joined the band, he would bring his mixtapes with him and play bands such as Exhorder, Slayer, and Rigor Mortis to the other band members.

In 1988, with Anselmo as the new vocalist, Pantera released their fourth studio album, titled &quot;Power Metal&quot;. &quot;Power Metal&quot;, like Pantera&#x27;s previous three albums, was released by Metal Magic Records, but showcased a change in their sound. By far the band&#x27;s heaviest album at this point, &quot;Power Metal&quot; had little resemblance to the power metal subgenre, but was a mix of 1980s glam metal and thrash metal, sometimes blending both styles in a single song. Complementing the band&#x27;s new sonic approach were Anselmo&#x27;s harder-edged vocals compared to those of Terry Glaze. After the release of &quot;Power Metal&quot;, the band members decided to seriously reconsider their glam metal image and sound. Referring to the band&#x27;s spandex appearance, Vinnie Paul remarked at a band meeting that &quot;These magic clothes don&#x27;t play music; we do. Let&#x27;s just go out there and be comfortable, jeans, t-shirt, whatever, and see where it goes.&quot; The band members would later no longer acknowledge their independent releases, including &quot;Power Metal&quot;, as they sculpted a new, heavier image to accompany their later groove metal sound. Their four independent albums are not listed on the band&#x27;s official website and have become hard-to-find collector&#x27;s items.

Shortly after &quot;Power Metal&quot; was released, Megadeth needed a guitarist and asked Diamond Darrell to join the band. Darrell insisted that his brother, bandmate Vinnie Paul, be included. However, Megadeth had already hired Nick Menza as their new drummer so Darrell declined the offer, and Dave Mustaine instead decided on Marty Friedman.

===1989–1991: &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; and mainstream breakthrough===
The Abbott brothers refocused their attention on Pantera, and in 1989 they were given their first shot at commercial success. That year was also when the band formed their relationship with Walter O&#x27;Brien at Concrete Management (the management arm of Concrete Marketing), who remained their manager until they disbanded in 2003.

After being turned down &quot;28 times by every major label on the face of the Earth&quot;, Atco Records representatives Mark Ross and Stevenson Eugenio were asked by their boss Derek Shulman, who was interested in signing Pantera, to see the band perform in Texas. Ross was so impressed by the band&#x27;s performance that he called his boss that night, suggesting that the band should be signed to the label. Atco Records accepted, and at the conclusion of 1989, the band recorded its major label debut at Pantego Studios and hired Terry Date to produce it, in large part because of his work with Soundgarden, Metal Church, and Overkill, the latter of whose latest album at the time &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; was one of the sources of inspiration behind Pantera&#x27;s transition away from glam/traditional heavy metal to thrash/groove metal, as well as Diamond Darrell&#x27;s guitar tone on the album.
Looking for their first big breakthrough, Pantera released their fifth studio album, titled &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, on July 24, 1990, which was produced by Pantera and Date. Pantera showed a more extreme style on this outing, leaving behind its glam metal influences in favor of mid-tempo thrash metal dubbed &quot;power groove&quot; (groove metal) by the band. Although Anselmo still used some Rob Halford-influenced vocals, he also adopted a more abrasive delivery. Darrell&#x27;s more complex guitar solos and riffs, along with his brother&#x27;s faster-paced drum-work were evidence of the band&#x27;s extreme transformation. The album marked a critical juncture in the band&#x27;s history. Many fans, and the band itself, have referred to &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; as Pantera&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; debut. &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; also notably included the power ballad &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, which &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; praised as the best Pantera song and &quot;one of the greatest epic ballads in metal history&quot;.

To promote the album, Pantera began the &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; tour by opening for thrash acts Exodus and Suicidal Tendencies. In 1991, Halford performed with the band onstage, which led Pantera (along with Annihilator) to open for Judas Priest on its first show in Europe. In addition, Halford collaborated with Pantera on the song &quot;Light Comes Out of Black&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Pantera also opened for other bands like Sepultura, Fates Warning, Prong, Mind Over Four, and Morbid Angel, and co-headlined a North American tour with Wrathchild America. The band eventually landed a billing for &quot;Monsters in Moscow&quot; with AC/DC and Metallica in September 1991, where they played to a crowd of over 500,000 in attendance to celebrate the new freedom of performing Western music in the Soviet Union shortly before its downfall three months later. The band was often found at the Dallas club &quot;the Basement&quot;, where the band shot the videos for &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; and &quot;Psycho Holiday&quot;. Pantera&#x27;s 2006 home video compilation &quot;3 Vulgar Videos from Hell&quot; features performances of &quot;Primal Concrete Sledge&quot;, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, &quot;Domination&quot;, and &quot;Psycho Holiday&quot; from the show in Moscow.

===1991–1995: &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;===

Pantera&#x27;s unique &quot;groove&quot; style came to fruition with their sixth studio album, titled &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, recorded in 1991 and released on February 25, 1992. On this album, the power metal falsetto vocals were replaced with a hardcore-influenced shouted delivery and heavier guitar sound, which firmly cemented the band&#x27;s popularity among mainstream and underground fans alike. Two other singles from the album became two of Pantera&#x27;s most notable ballads: &quot;This Love&quot;, a haunting piece about lust and abuse, and &quot;Hollow&quot;, somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; from the previous album. The band would play the song &quot;Domination&quot; (from &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;) leading into the ending of &quot;Hollow&quot; (what is roughly the last 2:30 of the album version), forming a medley referred to as &quot;Dom/Hollow&quot;, as can be heard on the band&#x27;s 1997 live album &quot;Official Live: 101 Proof&quot;. Singles from &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; also received significant airplay on radio as did the companion music videos on MTV. &quot;Walk&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s more popular songs, and it appeared on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the No. 35 position. The album itself entered the American charts at No. 44. Pantera went on tour again, visiting Japan for the first time in July 1992 and later performing at the &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; festival co-headlined by Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath in Italy. It was around this time that Darrell Abbott dropped the nickname &quot;Diamond Darrell&quot; and assumed &quot;Dimebag Darrell&quot;, and Rex Brown dropped the pseudonym &quot;Rex Rocker&quot;.

Pantera released their seventh studio album, titled &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, on March 22, 1994, which debuted at No. 1 in both United States and Australian album charts. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot;, earned the band&#x27;s first Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; in 1995. &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, a Black Sabbath cover which appeared on &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, was the band&#x27;s first charting single in the U.S. as it peaked at No. 21 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The album saw Pantera continue its groove metal approach, while taking an even more extreme direction with its musical style. The album&#x27;s original artwork (a drill bit impaling an anus) was banned, so it was re-released with the familiar skull impaled with a drill bit. A limited edition was released with a slip-cover case. Also, a boxed set called &quot;Driven Down Under Tour &#x27;94 Souvenir Collection&quot; was released in Australia and New Zealand to coincide with the tours there. It featured &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; (with its original banned artwork) with a bonus thirteenth track, &quot;The Badge&quot; (a Poison Idea cover), the five-track &quot;Alive and Hostile&quot; EP, and the Japanese collector&#x27;s edition &quot;Walk&quot; EP, all presented in a special cardboard box with an eight-page color biography.

Pantera began touring again, starting in South America, along with being accepted into another &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; billing. In late June, Anselmo was charged with assault for attacking a security guard after he prevented fans from getting on stage. Anselmo was released on a $5,000 bail the next day. The trial was delayed three times. In May 1995, he apologized in court and pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was ordered to undergo 100 hours of community service. Pantera continued their tour of the United Kingdom in 1994 and eventually ended it in North America where the band was supported by Sepultura and Prong.

===1995–1999: Band tensions and &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;===
According to the Abbott brothers, Anselmo began behaving strangely and distanced himself from the band when they returned to the road in 1995. The rest of the band members first thought that fame had gotten to Anselmo, but Anselmo cited back pain from years of intense performances as the reason for his erratic behavior. Anselmo attempted to alleviate his pain through alcohol, but this, as he admitted, was affecting his performances and &quot;putting some worry into the band.&quot; Doctors predicted that with surgery, Anselmo&#x27;s back problem could be corrected, but with a long recovery time. Unwilling to spend so long away from the band, Anselmo refused, and began using heroin as a painkiller.

After stating at a Montreal concert that &quot;rap music advocates the killing of white people&quot;, Anselmo denied accusations of racism and issued an apology, stating that he was drunk and that his remarks were a mistake. In 1995, the supergroup Down, one of Anselmo&#x27;s many side projects, released their debut album, &quot;NOLA&quot;, but shortly afterwards the group members returned to their respective bands, leaving Down inactive for several years.

Pantera&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;, was released on May 7, 1996, and is often considered their &quot;overlooked&quot; album. Anselmo recorded the vocals for this release in Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor&#x27;s studio in New Orleans while the rest of the band recorded in Dallas. In comparison to the band&#x27;s previous efforts, there was emphasis on vocal overdubbing in a somewhat &quot;demonic&quot; fashion. Drug abuse is a recurring theme in &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;, as exemplified by tracks such as &quot;Suicide Note Pt. I/Pt. II&quot;, &quot;10&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Living Through Me (Hell&#x27;s Wrath)&quot;. &quot;Drag the Waters&quot; was the album&#x27;s only music video. The album&#x27;s other single, &quot;Floods&quot;, achieved acclaim largely because of Darrell&#x27;s complex guitar solo, which ranked No. 15 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; of all time.

On July 13, 1996, during their tour with Eyehategod and White Zombie, Anselmo overdosed on heroin an hour after a Texas homecoming gig. After his heart stopped beating for almost five minutes, Anselmo was revived with an adrenaline shot. Anselmo apologized to his bandmates the next night and said that he would quit using drugs. The revelation of heroin use came as a shock to Vinnie and Darrell, who were embarrassed by Anselmo&#x27;s actions, according to Rita Haney, the guitarist&#x27;s girlfriend. Anselmo said that he relapsed twice after this and was overcome with guilt.

Pantera released their first live album, &quot;Official Live: 101 Proof&quot;, on July 29, 1997, which included fourteen live tracks and two new studio recordings: &quot;Where You Come From&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hide&quot;. Two weeks before the live album&#x27;s release, Pantera received its first platinum album, for &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;. Just four months later, both &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; were awarded platinum as well. The band also received their second and third &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; Grammy nominations for &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Note (Pt. I)&quot; and &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The release of their video &quot;3 Watch It Go&quot; earned them a 1997 Metal Edge Readers&#x27; Choice Award, when it was voted &quot;Best Video Cassette&quot;.

Also in 1997, Pantera played on the mainstage of Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, Fear Factory, Machine Head, and Powerman 5000. Additionally, the band played on the 1998 UK Ozzfest tour alongside Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Foo Fighters, Slayer, Soulfly, Fear Factory, and Therapy?, as well as touring with Clutch and Neurosis.

===1999–2003: Side projects, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;, and breakup===
Around this time, Anselmo ventured into more side projects, such as playing guitars on Necrophagia&#x27;s 1999 release &quot;Holocausto de la Morte&quot;, where he went as the alias &quot;Anton Crowley&quot;, which combines the names of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey and occultist Aleister Crowley. He also temporarily joined the black metal supergroup Eibon and contributed vocals to that band&#x27;s only two songs. Another one of Anselmo&#x27;s &quot;Anton Crowley&quot; projects was black metal band Viking Crown. The Abbott brothers and Rex Brown began their own country metal crossover project, Rebel Meets Rebel with David Allan Coe, around the same time.

The band wrote a song for the NHL&#x27;s Dallas Stars during the team&#x27;s 1999 Stanley Cup Championship run, &quot;Puck Off&quot;, which in recent years has been used as the Stars&#x27; goal song at American Airlines Center. Throughout the season, members of the team befriended members of Pantera. During a Stanley Cup party hosted by Vinnie Paul, the Stanley Cup was damaged when Guy Carbonneau attempted to throw the cup from the balcony of Vinnie Paul&#x27;s house into his pool. The Cup landed short on the concrete deck and had to be repaired by NHL commissioned silversmiths. Later on in 1999, Pantera contributed the Ted Nugent cover &quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. It became the band&#x27;s second appearance on the Mainstream Rock Chart, peaking at the No. 40 position.

Pantera returned to the recording studio with Anselmo in 1999, releasing their ninth (considered fifth by the band itself) and final studio album, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;, on March 21, 2000. The album debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and included two singles; &quot;Revolution Is My Name&quot; and &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot;, the latter of which featured a Kerry King outro solo recorded backstage in one take during Ozzfest in Dallas. &quot;Revolution Is My Name&quot; became the band&#x27;s fourth nomination for Best Metal Performance in the 2001 Grammys, and it peaked at No. 28 on the Mainstream Rock Chart in the U.S.. In 2000, Pantera played on the mainstage of Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Godsmack, Static-X, Methods of Mayhem, Incubus, P.O.D., Black Label Society, Queens of the Stone Age, and Apartment 26. In November, the band canceled their planned tour after Anselmo broke his ribs after falling during his eighth annual House of Shock event.

In 2001, the band once again returned to touring, playing with fellow metal bands Morbid Angel, Skrape, Slayer, and Static-X as part of the Extreme Steel Tour of North America. They were also guest musicians on the show &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; in the episode &quot;Pre-Hibernation Week&quot;, performing the song &quot;Death Rattle&quot; from &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; (renamed as &quot;Pre-Hibernation&quot; on the 2001 soundtrack &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights&quot;). Following the Extreme Steel tour, a planned tour of Europe was cut short as a result of the September 11 attacks, which left the band stranded in Dublin, Ireland for six days as a result of all flights being canceled. Pantera played their last show in Yokohama, Japan at the &quot;Beast Feast&quot; festival on August 28, 2001. This would be the last time the members of Pantera performed together. Back home, the band planned to release its fourth home video in the summer of 2002 and record another studio album later that year, but neither came about.

Anselmo again engaged in numerous side projects. In March 2002, Down released its second studio album, &quot;Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot;, which featured Rex Brown on bass following Todd Strange&#x27;s departure in 1999. Brown remained Down&#x27;s full-time bassist until 2011, having appeared on their subsequent release in 2007. Also, in May of that year, Anselmo&#x27;s Superjoint Ritual released its debut album, &quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot;. Vinnie Paul claimed that Anselmo told him that he would take a year off following the events of September 11, 2001, but Anselmo&#x27;s touring and recording output for both Superjoint Ritual and Down contradicted this. Nonetheless, Anselmo recalled that a &quot;great distancing&quot; occurred among the band in this period. The Abbott brothers were frustrated, and held out for an indefinite period of time, assuming that Anselmo would return. However, according to Anselmo, taking a break from Pantera was a &quot;mutual thing&quot; between each of the band members.

The Abbott brothers officially disbanded Pantera in November 2003, also the year when their best-of compilation album was released, when the two concluded that Anselmo had abandoned them and would not return. The dissolution of the band was not amicable and subsequently a war of words was waged between the former bandmates via the press. In an MTV Headbanger&#x27;s Ball interview in January 2004, Vinnie Paul explained that they had not spoken to Anselmo in two years, and was cynical in response to Anselmo wishing the Abbott brothers success, citing Anselmo&#x27;s &quot;sedated state.&quot; Meanwhile, Dimebag implied in interviews that Anselmo had returned to heroin use, something which Anselmo said was unsubstantiated as he was over 3 years sober. Anselmo&#x27;s comment in a 2004 issue of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine, saying that Dimebag would &quot;attack him&quot; verbally and &quot;deserves to be beaten severely&quot;, typified Pantera&#x27;s internal conflicts; Anselmo insisted that this comment was tongue-in-cheek, and he was upset that the quote ended up on the cover of the magazine. This explanation was soon dismissed by Vinnie Paul, who said shortly after the 2004 murder of his brother that he had personally listened to the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted or misrepresented, but said the exact words which appeared in the article. &quot;I think, more or less, it lies between Dimebag and I. There was never a point when he could not get drunk. Which was pretty much every day. And now I&#x27;m hearing it&#x27;s worse than ever [...] The anger and the hatred and the drunken nights of just screaming in my face, with me sitting there taking it and holding both of my hands just to not hit the guy… I grew weary of that. I was sick of being his whipping post, y&#x27;know, and I just politely, or unpolitely, excused myself.&quot; - Anselmo, December 2004Caught up in the torrent was Rex Brown, who later said &quot;It was a bunch of he said, she said nonsense that was going on, and I wasn&#x27;t going to get in the middle of it.&quot; In a 2015 interview, he&#x27;d add, &quot;Vinnie drew this imaginary line in the sand [...] He said, ‘You’re either on our side or not.’ I didn&#x27;t want to take sides. [...] The whole thing was ridiculous, but I never talked about it.&quot;.

In July 2004, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; went double-platinum, and &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; went platinum the next month.

===2003–2004: Damageplan and the murder of Dimebag Darrell===
After Pantera&#x27;s disbandment, Darrell and Vinnie formed a new band, Damageplan, with vocalist Pat Lachman and bassist Bob Zilla. Damageplan released their first and only studio album, &quot;New Found Power&quot;, on February 10, 2004. The album was a commercial success; over 44,000 copies were sold in its first week alone and within a year over 100,000 copies were sold, while the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot; had appeared on the Mainstream Rock Chart. However, some fans felt that Damageplan&#x27;s material did not measure up to that of Pantera.

On December 8, 2004, less than a minute into the first song of a Damageplan show at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, a 25-year-old man named Nathan Gale walked onto the stage with a gun, shooting and killing Darrell. Gale also killed fan Nathan Bray, 23, club employee Erin Halk, 29, and Pantera security official Jeff &quot;Mayhem&quot; Thompson, 40, and injured longtime Pantera and Damageplan drum technician John &quot;Kat&quot; Brooks and Damageplan tour manager Chris Paluska before being shot dead by Columbus police officer James Niggemeyer.

No motive has been given as to why Gale killed Dimebag Darrell and the other victims, but early theories, which were dismissed by police, suggested that Gale, who was reported to have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was apparently upset over Pantera&#x27;s breakup. In a number of interviews, some of Gale&#x27;s friends suggested that he claimed that he had written songs that were stolen by Pantera.

A week after the shooting, it was reported that album sales of both Damageplan and Pantera albums jumped sharply.

===2004–2022: After Damageplan, personal issues, and Vinnie Paul&#x27;s death===
When Anselmo called in the aftermath of the murders, Rita Haney, Darrell&#x27;s girlfriend, told him she would &quot;blow Anselmo&#x27;s head off&quot; if he attended Darrell&#x27;s funeral. He was buried with Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s black and yellow-striped Charvel electric guitar (sometimes referred to as &quot;Bumblebee&quot;), which was pictured with Van Halen on the inner sleeve and back cover of the album &quot;Van Halen II&quot;. Dimebag had asked for one of these guitars in 2004, shortly before his death. Eddie Van Halen originally agreed to make Darrell a copy of the guitar, but upon hearing of Abbott&#x27;s death, offered to place the actual guitar in his casket. Dimebag was buried in a Kiss Kasket (a casket inspired by the band Kiss). Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons said, &quot;There were a limited number made and I sent mine to the family of &#x27;Dimebag&#x27; Darrell. He requested in his will to be buried in a Kiss Kasket, as he sort of learned his rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll roots by listening to us for some strange reason.&quot; Not long after Darrell&#x27;s murder, Anselmo received a heated message from Vinnie, which (according to Anselmo) &quot;went along the lines that my (Anselmo&#x27;s) day was coming.&quot; Anselmo&#x27;s rebuttal was that everybody&#x27;s day is coming and that if his day should come before Vinnie&#x27;s, it would not change anything except for Vinnie having to go through &quot;losing another brother&quot;.

Public comments made by Anselmo following the shooting suggested that he had considered reuniting with the band prior to Darrell&#x27;s death. However, one year after the murder, Paul stated in an interview that this reunion was never going to happen.

On May 11, 2006, the VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode on Pantera premiered. While focusing heavily on Darrell&#x27;s murder and burial, the episode also detailed the band&#x27;s glam metal beginnings, the band&#x27;s rise in popularity after the change in musical direction, and the conflicts between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers in the band&#x27;s later years that would tear them apart. When asked by Crave Music in 2006 if there was any chance of reconciling with Phil Anselmo, Vinnie Paul answered &quot;Absolutely not. That&#x27;s it.&quot; The former Pantera drummer subsequently began work on Hellyeah, a collaboration between him and members from Mudvayne and Nothingface. Both Anselmo and Brown reunited with Down, and supported Heaven &amp; Hell and Megadeth on their 2007 Canadian tour, as well as supporting Metallica on the first half of their World Magnetic Tour.

In interviews in 2009 and 2010, both Rita Haney and Phil Anselmo stated that, after a meeting at Download 2009, they had patched up their differences and are once again on speaking terms. On March 30, 2010, Pantera released a greatest-hits compilation album, titled &quot;1990–2000: A Decade of Domination&quot;. It was made available exclusively at Walmart stores and is made up of 10 tracks that were remastered.

During a 2012 appearance on &quot;That Metal Show&quot;, when asked about the possibility of a Pantera reunion, Vinnie Paul said that it would be possible if Dimebag Darrell were still alive. Despite being proud of his Pantera years, however, he indicated that there were no plans for a reunion, adding that &quot;some stones are better left unturned.&quot; In 2013, Brown published his autobiography titled &quot;Official Truth: 101 Proof&quot;, which chronicled his time in Pantera.

Comments about a potential one-off reunion concert continued to resurface periodically, with Zakk Wylde often being suggested as the stand-in replacement for Darrell. Paul, however, had been strictly resistant to the idea. Despite several overtures towards reconciliation by Anselmo towards Paul, the two men remained permanently estranged.

In a July 2015 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Anselmo spoke out against Pantera and his other band&#x27;s usage of the Confederate flag claiming it was a mistake to use it on their merchandise, albums, and other promotional material. Anselmo said &quot;These days, I wouldn&#x27;t want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully... I wouldn&#x27;t. The way I feel and the group of people I&#x27;ve had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says &#x27;Heritage, not hate.&#x27; I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;m buying into that.&quot; Anselmo said originally that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd but it was never about promoting hate.

Also in 2015, Anselmo and Brown were interviewed at length about Pantera for the book &quot;Survival of the Fittest: Heavy Metal in the 1990s&quot;, by author Greg Prato. Brown also penned the foreword for the book, while a concert photo from 1994 of Anselmo and Darrell was used for the book&#x27;s cover image.

On June 22, 2018, Paul died at the age of 54, making him the second founding member of Pantera (following his brother) to die. Sources initially said that the cause of his death was a massive heart attack in his sleep, but on August 27, 2018, the official cause of death was revealed to be dilated cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease.

In November 2018, Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals, while on tour supporting their second full-length album, played their first setlist composed entirely of Pantera songs. The trend continued all throughout the rest of the year as well as in 2019, with the tour being dubbed as &quot;a Pantera tribute&quot;. On January 28, 2020, Pantera surpassed one billion streams across most major streaming music services (Amazon, Apple Music, Deezer, Google, and Spotify).

==== Reissues ====
Between 2010 and 2020, Pantera&#x27;s five major label studio albums had all been reissued, typically with extra content.

In 2010, a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; was released, and it included the unreleased outtake track &quot;The Will to Survive&quot; along with various demo versions of the album&#x27;s songs.

On April 11, 2012, at the Revolver Golden God Awards a new song, titled &quot;Piss&quot;, was debuted after being discovered in the Pantera &quot;vaults&quot; by Vinnie Paul. A music video was made for &quot;Piss&quot; and shown at the awards show and, according to Vinnie Paul, it was the only complete previously unheard Pantera track. It was recorded during the &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; sessions. The track was included on the 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, and the single peaked at No. 23 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The reissue also included a live DVD from a concert in Italy.

On March 22, 2014, Pantera released a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;. All songs were remastered, and as a bonus, they released a live recording of their 1994 &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; performance. Unlike the prior two reissues, no previously unheard songs or outtake tracks were included.

&quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; was reissued in 2016 for its 20th anniversary. The bonus content included instrumental versions, different mixes, demo takes, and live versions of the album&#x27;s songs. Similar to &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, no previously unheard compositions or non-album songs were included.

In 2020, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; was also reissued for its 20th anniversary. It had consisted of the album&#x27;s songs remastered along with alternate mixes, radio edits, and instrumental mixes. Five non-album tracks (which were initially featured on soundtracks or as B-sides to the singles) were included as well.

===2022–present: Reformation with new lineup===

On July 13, 2022, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Brown and Anselmo were reuniting in 2023 for Pantera&#x27;s first major tour in 22 years, and it was announced that they had signed with Artist Group International to book a North American tour. Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante were later announced as the respective fill-ins for Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul. Phil Anselmo later revealed that a few musicians were also &quot;on the list&quot; to fill-in for guitar, notably Ola Englund and Kayla Kent.

When asked in November 2022 by Bravewords.com if Pantera were planning to record new material, Benante said, &quot;Oh man, who knows? Creatively, if we are just flowing and getting going, and things are starting to be really good, musically speaking, you never know what could happen. I&#x27;ve got tons of riffs.&quot; Sterling Winfield (who produced &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;) stated he would not &quot;feel comfortable calling it Pantera&quot;, but added that the new lineup &quot;could make some very badass music&quot;. He said, &quot;I will say that it is entirely plausible, it is entirely possible, but at this point in time, I don&#x27;t know that anybody&#x27;s looking that far down the road. They&#x27;ve got a world tour to tackle, man, for the next two years, and they are gonna be busy doing that. Now, could it happen? Yes.&quot; Wylde has also expressed interest in recording new music with Anselmo, Brown and Benante, but not as Pantera &quot;unless it was just pre-existing material and [they] were gonna record it — stuff that was in demo state or whatever, and it is songs that the guys wrote.&quot; According to Benante, there has been talk of the band releasing a live album from the reunion tour. In an interview in Australia, bassist Rex Brown hinted that Pantera will be releasing new music at some point in the future (which would be their first new material released since 2000), saying: &quot;Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I could tell you more but I&#x27;m not going to.&quot;

The updated lineup of Pantera played their first shows in 21 years in Latin America in December 2022, co-headlining Mexico&#x27;s Monterrey Metal Fest with Judas Priest, and also appearing at Hell &amp; Heaven Metal Fest in Mexico and Knotfest in Chile, Brazil and Colombia. The band then embarked on their first full-scale tour of Europe since 2000 in May and June 2023, and supported Metallica on selected North American dates of their 2023–2024 M72 World Tour. Three shows into the band&#x27;s December 2022 Latin America run, it was revealed Rex Brown had contracted COVID-19 and was replaced by bassist Derek Engemann (who plays with Phil Anselmo in Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals and Scour) for the remaining shows. The band&#x27;s concerts at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals in Germany and in Vienna, Austria in 2023 were canceled following an outcry over Anselmo&#x27;s previous racist remarks and his showing of the Hitler salute at an earlier event. Pantera toured Europe again through January and February 2025, followed by their first tour of the UK and Ireland in more than two decades. The band is scheduled to continue touring throughout the spring, summer and fall of 2025, during which they will be playing U.S. dates with Metallica and Suicidal Tendencies, performing as one of the supporting acts for Black Sabbath&#x27;s final show in the UK, and touring the U.S. with Amon Amarth.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Pantera&#x27;s music, starting with 1990&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, is generally considered groove metal, a genre they pioneered. The band&#x27;s early albums in the 1980s were primarily glam metal, while the first album with Phil Anselmo, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Power Metal&quot;, toned down the glam influences and was primarily a traditional heavy metal album, described as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the band&#x27;s old and new style. Pantera has also been cited (along with others, such as Testament, Sepultura, and Machine Head) as being part of the second wave of thrash metal from the late 1980s to early-to-mid 1990s, though Anselmo has rejected this label.

Pantera toured on Ozzfest as main stage acts twice; the band played at the second annual Ozzfest in 1997 and the fifth Ozzfest in 2000. Over the course of their career, Pantera&#x27;s members became known for their excessive partying and debauchery, even acquiring an official drink called the &quot;Black Tooth Grin&quot;. The &quot;Black Tooth Grin&quot; (&quot;Black Tooth&quot;, &quot;The Grin&quot;, or &quot;BTG&quot;, alternatively), named after lyrics from Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;, is a mixture of Crown Royal or Seagram 7 whisky (or both) and Coca-Cola. Conversely, Brown noted that the band never drank in the studio, in order to stay focused writing and recording.

Aside from their post-glam, thrash metal influences, the band members cite heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath as one of their favorite bands. As a tribute, Pantera has recorded three different covers of Black Sabbath songs (all from the Ozzy Osbourne era). The first was &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, a slower, quieter song planned for the first Sabbath tribute album, &quot;Nativity in Black&quot;, that eventually became the final track on &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;. The band performed Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; on the second &quot;Nativity in Black&quot;. A previously unreleased cover of Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; was included on the band&#x27;s 2003 compilation album, &quot;The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys&#x27; Vulgar Hits!&quot; Pantera&#x27;s affinity for Black Sabbath is also shown through the lyrics, &quot;Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath&quot;, in &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot;. 

In a 2019 interview with &quot;MetalHammer&quot;, the band explained that their move away from glam began in early 1988, when Anselmo played &quot;At Dawn they Sleep&quot;, by Slayer, for Darrell Abbott. Subsequently, Anselmo&#x27;s vocals became inspired by Agnostic Front and Black Flag, and the instrumentalists by Slayer, Voivod, Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1989) and Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; (1989). Pantera&#x27;s other influences or inspirations include AC/DC, Accept, Aerosmith, Anthrax, the Beatles, Biohazard, Black Sabbath, Dark Angel, Def Leppard, Faith No More, Peter Frampton, Humble Pie, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King&#x27;s X, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Megadeth, Melvins, Mercyful Fate, Metallica, the Michael Schenker Group, Minor Threat, Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Overkill, Prong, the Rolling Stones, Savatage, Saxon, Sepultura, Sick of It All, Testament, Pat Travers, Robin Trower, Van Halen, Venom, and ZZ Top.

===Ideology and lyrical themes===
Pantera adopted a self-described &quot;take no shit&quot; attitude, epitomized in its song &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot; from the album &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;. According to Vinnie Paul, the song originated from an incident during a show in San Diego, California, Anselmo was annoyed by a heckler and encouraged the crowd to beat him up. Consequently, the band was sued by the father of the heckler who said he wanted &quot;five minutes alone&quot; with Anselmo to prove who was the &quot;big daddy&quot;, and Anselmo responded that he would use those &quot;five minutes alone&quot; with the father to &quot;whoop his ass.&quot;

Despite being a standard glam metal band early in their career, the band members perceive themselves to have subsequently had an uncompromising career in which they never &quot;sold out&quot; or gave in to trends. This is most noticeably highlighted in the themes and title of &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;. Anselmo said:

Similarly, the die-hard attitude of &quot;We&#x27;ll Grind That Axe for a Long Time&quot; (from &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;) is, according to Anselmo, &quot;in a way, our motto.&quot;

===Comparisons with Exhorder===
New Orleans heavy metal band Exhorder have suggested that Pantera copied their sound during the change from glam metal to groove metal. Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, marking a major stylistic shift, was released just before Exhorder&#x27;s debut, &quot;Slaughter in the Vatican&quot;. However, Exhorder self-released two demos in the late 1980s (around the time that Pantera was still playing glam metal). Exhorder&#x27;s members allege Pantera copied these demos.

A review at AllMusic noted some &quot;striking similarities&quot; between the two bands, both emphasizing mid-tempo songs and &quot;gruff but very expressive&quot; lead singers – similarities that fueled debate about whether one band imitated the other. In disagreement with the opinion that Exhorder is &quot;Pantera minus the good songs&quot;, AllMusic&#x27;s review of &quot;Slaughter in the Vatican&quot; expresses that &quot;perhaps a more accurate billing would be to call them Pantera without the major label backing.&quot; In explaining Exhorder&#x27;s much less successful career, AllMusic also point to the fact that the title of their debut, along with the blatantly provocative album cover, &quot;certainly didn&#x27;t help [their] cause any.&quot;

However, some critics dispute any notion that Pantera imitated Exhorder&#x27;s sound. Brian Davis, a contributor to Internet radio station KNAC, addresses the issue as follows:

Although originally decrying Pantera as a rip-off of their sound, Exhorder lead vocalist Kyle Thomas has stated that he does not care about any of the criticism and is sick of seeing Exhorder&#x27;s name tied to Pantera&#x27;s. He also stated that he and the members of Pantera were great friends who used to tour together, and that he mourns the loss of Dimebag Darrell. Guitarist Marzi Montazeri, however, who worked with Anselmo on one of his solo projects, said that Anselmo &quot;ripped off&quot; Thomas&#x27; vocal style, cause he was doing Rob Halford stuff back then, when he first joined Pantera. And when &quot;Cowboys&quot; came, he wanted to be in Exhorder so bad, he went back and said, &#x27;We&#x27;re gonna sound like these guys.&#x27; And he took it, simplified it, and became the biggest band in the world. But the formula was that.&quot;

==Legacy==
Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic said Pantera &quot;put to rest any and all remnants of the &#x27;80s metal scene, almost single-handedly demolishing any notion that hair metal, speed metal, power metal, et al., were anything but passé.&quot; Furthermore, the band has been influential to the development of nu metal, metalcore, and several other movements, and they have been called one of the pioneers of the new wave of American heavy metal. PopMatters has stated that, &quot;[Dimebag Darrell]&#x27;s influence on the entire genre of heavy metal is massive; after &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; and &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, every notable young American metal band since has, in some way or another, copied their guitar style from those records: Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Hatebreed, Lamb of God, Shadows Fall... the list is endless.&quot;

They have influenced many modern metal bands, including Slipknot, Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Trivium, Avenged Sevenfold, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, Gojira, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying and Five Finger Death Punch.

<doc id="142806" wikidata="Q320499" url="?curid=142806" title="Faith No More">
<text>Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1979. Before September 1983, the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man. Bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Roddy Bottum and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest-remaining members of the band, having been involved since its inception. The band underwent several early lineup changes, and some major changes later. The lineup of Faith No More consists of Gould, Bordin, Bottum, lead guitarist Jon Hudson, and vocalist/lyricist Mike Patton.

After releasing six studio albums, including best-selling records &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1989) and &quot;Angel Dust&quot; (1992), Faith No More officially announced its breakup on April 20, 1998. The band has since reunited, conducting The Second Coming Tour between 2009 and 2010, and releasing its seventh studio album, &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;, in May 2015. After the touring cycle of &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;, Faith No More went on hiatus once again. In November 2019, the band announced that it would reunite to embark on a 2020 UK and European tour, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Touring was due to recommence with 2021–2022 dates, but the tour was cancelled with Patton citing mental health reasons, and the band remains on hiatus as of 2025.

==History==
===Early days (1979–1984)===
The genesis of Faith No More was the group Sharp Young Men, formed in 1979, by vocalist Mike Morris and keyboardist Wade Worthington. Drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Billy Gould joined afterwards. Morris called the name &quot;a piss-take on all the &#x27;elegant&#x27; groups at the time&quot;. Later, he proposed the name Faith In No Man, but eventually the band settled on Bordin&#x27;s suggestion, Faith No Man (stylized as Faith. No Man). The band recorded &quot;Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty&quot;, released in 1983. The songs were recorded in Matt Wallace&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage, where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men, with Morris, Gould, Bordin and Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. The band&#x27;s name was changed to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace&#x27;s garage, and Roddy Bottum replaced Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name in September 1983 to accentuate the fact that &quot;The Man&quot; (Morris) was &quot;No More&quot;. The band played with several vocalists and guitarists, including a brief stint with Courtney Love, until it settled on vocalist Chuck Mosley in 1983 and, later, guitarist Jim Martin. Their first release under the Faith No More name was a self-titled cassette in 1983, which featured a live performance from that year on Side A, and a 20-minute instrumental track on Side B.

===&quot;We Care a Lot&quot; and &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot; (1985–1988)===

After the name change, the band initially started recording &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; without backing from a record label and, after pooling their money, recorded five songs. This gained the attention of Ruth Schwartz, who was then forming the independent label Mordam Records, under which the band, after getting the necessary financial support, finished and released the album. It was the first official release for both the band and the label.

In late 1986, Faith No More was signed to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had recently been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band&#x27;s following albums. &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot; was released in April 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album&#x27;s title track &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; saw minor success on MTV. Mosley&#x27;s behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;—during which he fell asleep on stage—and one of Mosley&#x27;s roadies getting into a fistfight with Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Gould reflected, &quot;There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I just said: &#x27;I&#x27;m done—I can&#x27;t take this any longer. It&#x27;s just so ridiculous&#x27;. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: &#x27;Well, I still want to play with you&#x27;. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these &#x27;firing somebody without firing them&#x27; scenarios.&quot;

===Mike Patton joins and &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1989–1991)===

Mosley was replaced with singer Mike Patton in 1988. Patton, who was singing with his high school band, Mr. Bungle, was recruited at Martin&#x27;s suggestion after he heard Mr. Bungle&#x27;s first demo tape, &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot;. According to Patton, he first met the band during a 1986 gig at &quot;a pizza parlor&quot; in his hometown of Eureka, California. Two weeks after joining Faith No More, he had written the lyrics to the songs that made up the Grammy award-nominated &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, which was released in June 1989.

&quot;Epic&quot; was released in January 1990 and was a top 10 hit. The music video received extensive airplay on MTV in 1990, and angered animal rights activists for a slow-motion shot of a fish flopping out of water at the end of the video. That same year, Faith No More performed at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on the 293rd episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (December 1). &quot;From Out of Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Falling to Pieces&quot; were released as singles, and a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;War Pigs&quot; was produced for non-vinyl releases. In 1990, the band went on an extensive U.S. tour, sending &quot;The Real Thing&quot; to Platinum status in Canada, the U.S., and South America. The album also had big sales numbers in Australia, U.K., and the rest of Europe, pushing the total sales well above 4 million worldwide.
In February 1991, Faith No More released its only official live album, &quot;Live at the Brixton Academy&quot;. The album includes two previously unreleased studio tracks, &quot;The Grade&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy Song&quot;. The same year, the band contributed the song &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; to the soundtrack to &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;. Martin also made a brief cameo in the film as &quot;Sir James Martin&quot; as the head of the &quot;Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center&quot;. Patton&#x27;s original band Mr. Bungle went on to sign with Slash and Reprise Records&#x27;s parent label Warner Bros. Records in 1991, after the worldwide success of &quot;The Real Thing&quot;.

===&quot;Angel Dust&quot; (1992–1994)===
Faith No More displayed an even more experimental effort on its next album, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, released in June 1992. One critic wrote that the album is &quot;one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label&quot; and another that the single &quot;&#x27;A Small Victory&#x27;, which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers [...] reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.&quot;

Aside from &quot;A Small Victory&quot; (which received a nomination for Best Art Direction at the MTV Video Music Awards), the tracks &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; and &quot;Everything&#x27;s Ruined&quot; were also released as singles. The album included a re-recording of the theme to the film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, and later pressings included a cover of The Commodores&#x27; &quot;Easy&quot;, which in some parts of the world became the band&#x27;s biggest hit. &quot;Angel Dust&quot; charted one spot higher on the Billboard 200 than &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, but was not as commercially successful in the U.S., selling 665,000 copies there. It outsold &quot;The Real Thing&quot; in many other countries. In Germany, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies. The album also matched the sales of &quot;The Real Thing&quot; in Canada (Platinum) and Australia (Gold), and surpassed it in the Netherlands, France, Russia, and the U.K. Worldwide sales are around 3.1 million copies.

After touring to support &quot;Angel Dust&quot; in the summer of 1993, longtime guitarist Martin left the band due to internal conflicts. He was reportedly unhappy with the band&#x27;s change in musical direction on &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, calling it &quot;gay disco&quot;. According to Bottum, Martin was fired via fax. Martin himself states it was his decision to leave. Both Godflesh guitarist Justin Broadrick and Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker were reportedly invited to join Faith No More after Martin&#x27;s departure, but declined. The position was filled by Mike Patton&#x27;s Mr. Bungle bandmate Trey Spruance, who left after recording 1995&#x27;s &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime,&quot; just before the band was to begin its world tour. Spruance was replaced by Dean Menta, the band&#x27;s keyboard tech.

===&quot;King for a Day...&quot;, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and break-up (1995–1998)===

Faith No More&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime,&quot; was released in March 1995, and varies greatly from song to song in style; punk, country, jazz, bossa nova, thrash metal, gospel music, along with other signature FNM elements, are woven together throughout the album. Singles included &quot;Digging the Grave&quot;, &quot;Evidence&quot;, and &quot;Ricochet&quot;. The album featured Mr. Bungle&#x27;s Trey Spruance on guitar. The record went Gold in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands and Germany, which gave the album a respectable sales figure of around 1.5 million copies; this was significantly lower than the sales of their previous albums. A 7 x 7-inch box set of singles was released, which included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs.

&quot;Album of the Year&quot; was released in June 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries (for example, in Germany, the album debuted at No. 2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months). In Australia, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; went to No. 1 and was certified Platinum. The album charted in many countries in Europe. To date, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; has sold around 2 million copies worldwide. The singles &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; and &quot;Last Cup of Sorrow&quot; had minimal success (notably, the music video for &quot;Last Cup of Sorrow&quot;, which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, was inspired by the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Vertigo&quot;). &quot;Stripsearch&quot; was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U.S. and U.K.). The album received largely negative reviews from U.S.-based critics at the time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote in June 1997 that &quot;[They] are floundering around desperately, groping for a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant&quot;, while &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; stated &quot;&quot;Album Of The Year&quot; leaves one feeling like waking up and finding last night&#x27;s used condom – sure, the ride was fun while it lasted, but what remains is just plain icky. And you definitely don&#x27;t want it in your CD player.&quot; Following the album&#x27;s release, Faith No More toured with Limp Bizkit in 1997, who were frequently booed by Faith No More&#x27;s fans.

In early 1998, rumors of Faith No More&#x27;s imminent demise began; commencing with a post to Faith No More newsgroup alt.music.faith-no-more claiming Mike Patton had quit the band in favor of side projects. This rumor, denied at the time, proved to be at least partly true. Faith No More played their last show in Lisbon, Portugal on April 7, 1998. The band cancelled their planned support tour for Aerosmith and on April 20, Billy Gould released a statement by email and fax, saying &quot;[T]he decision among the members is mutual&quot; and &quot;the split will now enable each member to pursue his individual project(s) unhindered.&quot; The band &quot;thank[ed] all of those fans and associates that have stuck with and supported the band throughout its history.&quot;

===Reformation (2009–2012)===
Rumours that Faith No More would reunite for shows in the U.K. in the summer of 2009 were circulating in late November 2008, but were originally dismissed by bassist Billy Gould. He explained: &quot;If anything like this were to happen, it would have to come from the band, and I haven&#x27;t spoken with any of them in over a year. So as far as I know, there isn&#x27;t anything to talk about, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you were to contact Patton, he would tell you the same thing.&quot;

However, on February 24, 2009, after months of speculation and rumors, Faith No More announced they would be reforming with a line-up identical to the &quot;Album of the Year&quot; era, embarking on a reunion tour called &quot;The Second Coming Tour&quot;. To coincide with the band&#x27;s reunion tour, Rhino released the sixth Faith No More compilation, &quot;The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection&quot;, a double album that includes their hit singles and b sides &amp; rarities, in the U.K. on June 8. Faith No More then played in major European festivals including Download Festival in the U.K. in June, Hurricane and Southside festivals in Germany, Greenfield Festival in Switzerland, Hove Festival in Norway and Roskilde Festival in Denmark, among other dates. The tour continued into 2010 with appearances at the Soundwave Festival in Australian cities throughout February and March. During their tour, the band added covers to their repertoire including &quot;Poker Face&quot; by Lady Gaga, &quot;Ben&quot; by Michael Jackson and &quot;Switch&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees.

After an eleven-month hiatus, Faith No More played four shows in South America in November 2011. On the first date (November 8, 2011), the band played a &quot;mystery song&quot;, which led to speculation of new material. They played Sonisphere France on July 7, 2012. Following several more shows in Europe during 2012, Faith No More became temporarily inactive again. Mike Patton spent 2013 touring with his reformed rock supergroup Tomahawk, while the band&#x27;s other members also pursued their own side projects. In July 2013, Billy Gould confirmed that the band&#x27;s hiatus would not be permanent, saying &quot;We will do something again only when all members are with the focus on that, and ready for the challenge. This is not the time... yet.&quot;

In November 2011, the band performed “king for a day, fool for a lifetime” album live at Maquinaria Festival in Chile with Trey Spruance on guitar.

In a 2015 interview, Roddy Bottum said that the band originally intended to reform with guitarist Jim Martin for their reunion tour, but it did not happen.

===&quot;Sol Invictus&quot;, hiatus and touring (2015–present)===
On May 29, 2014, Faith No More posted a message (along with a photograph of Mike Patton) on their Twitter account, saying that &quot;the reunion thing was fun, but now it&#x27;s time to get a little creative.&quot; On July 4, Faith No More played their first show in two years at Hyde Park in London, supporting Black Sabbath. At that show, Faith No More debuted two new songs &quot;Motherfucker&quot; and &quot;Superhero&quot; (also known by fans as &quot;Leader of Men&quot;). On August 20, the band posted &quot;The Reunion Tour is over; in 2015 things are going to change.&quot; These tweets led to speculation that the band was working on new material. On August 30, Gould said that the band is &quot;considering doing something new&quot;, and may begin work on a new studio album at some point in the not-too-distant future, explaining, &quot;to do something creative would be a really good thing to do.&quot; On September 2, Bill Gould revealed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the band had begun work on a new album. Faith No More headlined the final edition of Australia&#x27;s Soundwave in February and March 2015.

The band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;, in May 2015. The songs on the album were influenced by The Cramps, Link Wray and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Speaking to &quot;Revolver&quot;, Gould described the song &quot;Cone of Shame&quot; as &quot;blues-based rock and roll&quot;. Describing the song &quot;Matador&quot;, he said: &quot;parts of it remind me of the first Siouxsie and the Banshees album. We used real pianos and that brings this organic quality to it to the music&quot;. The second single from the album, &quot;Superhero&quot;, was shared by the band on March 1, 2015.

In August 2016, the band performed two concerts with former lead singer Chuck Mosley to celebrate the reissue of their debut album &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;. The band was billed as &quot;Chuck Mosley &amp; Friends&quot; for the two shows and featured the lineup of Mosley, Mike Bordin, Billy Gould, Jon Hudson and Roddy Bottum.

Former Faith No More singer Chuck Mosley died on November 9, 2017. The cause was described as &quot;the disease of addiction.” He was 57 years old.

In February 2018, it was announced that a documentary film on the late former Faith No More frontman Chuck Mosley had begun production; titled &quot;Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie&quot;, the film is being directed and edited by Drew Fortier and produced by Douglas Esper.

On November 23, 2019, Faith No More updated its official website and social media accounts with an image of the band&#x27;s eight-pointed star logo in front of a snow-covered mountain top, accompanied by a clock counting down to November 26, 2019; on the latter date, the band announced its first shows in five years set to take place in Europe in June 2020, including Sunstroke Festival in Ireland, Hellfest in France and Tons of Rock in Norway. Less than twenty-four hours later, the Mad Cool Festival in Madrid, Spain, scheduled for July 2020, was added to the list of the band&#x27;s festival dates. They subsequently rescheduled most of its tour dates, including the Australian and European legs, to 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The band was scheduled to play two shows at the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles with System of a Down, Helmet and Russian Circles, which were initially set to take place May 22–23, 2020, but were postponed twice due to the pandemic, and Faith No More was replaced by Korn. The band was scheduled to play additional shows in September 2021 but these were also cancelled with Patton citing mental health reasons. In a 2022 interview with The Guardian, Patton disclosed that he has not spoken to the members of Faith No More since the initial show cancellations, leaving the band&#x27;s future in question. In October 2024, keyboardist Roddy Bottum stated that the band is on a &quot;semi-permanent hiatus&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==

Faith No More&#x27;s music is generally considered to be alternative metal, experimental rock, , alternative rock, and rap metal; however, as Faith No Man, their sound was described as post-punk. The band&#x27;s first single from 1983, &quot;Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty&quot;, was labelled as a &quot;solid post-punk/pre-goth single&quot;. These elements endured during their tenure with Chucky Mosley, with AllMusic comparing their first album to early Public Image Ltd works, and Mosley&#x27;s vocals drawing comparisons to Bauhaus lead singer Peter Murphy and H.R. of Bad Brains. By the mid-1980s, Billy Gould stated the band were in a &quot;weird spot&quot;, as their eclectic sound didn&#x27;t fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era. Upon Mike Patton&#x27;s arrival in 1989, the band began to expand their sound range even further, merging disparate genres such as synth-pop, thrash metal, and carousel music on &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; states that by 1997, the band were &quot;too heavy for the post-grunge pop hits of The Verve and Third Eye Blind [and] too arty to work comfortably with the nu metal knuckle-draggers they spawned.&quot; Over the course of their career, they have experimented with heavy metal, funk, hip hop, progressive rock, alternative rock, hardcore punk, polka, country, easy listening, jazz, samba, ska, bossa nova, hard rock, pop, soul, trip hop, gospel, and lounge music.

Faith No More&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;bizarrely humorous&quot;. When interviewed about his lyrics, Patton responded, &quot;I think that too many people think too much about my lyrics. I am more a person who works more with the sound of a word than with its meaning. Often I just choose the words because of the rhythm, not because of the meaning.&quot;

In addition to the band&#x27;s subsequently more apparent metal influences, like Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, Bordin acknowledged many gothic rock and post-punk bands as early influences, including Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, Psychedelic Furs, Echo and the Bunnymen, Killing Joke, Public Image Ltd, and Theatre of Hate. Upon reforming, Faith No More returned to these influences on &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;.

==Legacy==
In a 2015 article by Artistdirect, the musicians Duff McKagan, Chino Moreno, Serj Tankian, Corey Taylor, Max Cavalera and Jonathan Davis all praised the band for their significance and influence. Nirvana bassist, and co-founder, Krist Novoselic cited Faith No More as a band that &quot;paved the way for Nirvana&quot; in the late 1980s. Robert Plant, singer of Led Zeppelin, mentioned the then Chuck Mosley-led Faith No More as one of his favorite bands in a 1988 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Plant and Faith No More subsequently toured together following &quot;The Real Thing&quot;″s release. Scott Ian of Anthrax has also named Faith No More as one of his favorite bands. Alexander Julien of Vision Eternel named Faith No More as his favorite band in numerous interviews and has listed it as a major influence on his music. In interviews with &quot;The PRP&quot;, Mushroomhead, Lostprophets, The Dillinger Escape Plan, American Head Charge, Dog Fashion Disco, Grüvis Malt, and Vex Red each listed Faith No More as a major influence.

Corey Taylor (frontman for both Slipknot and Stone Sour) told Loudwire in 2015 that if it wasn&#x27;t for Faith No More, he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be here today.&quot; While recovering from an attempted suicide at his grandmother&#x27;s house, he saw the band perform &quot;Epic&quot; live on the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and the performance inspired him to begin writing and performing music again.

They were voted No. 52 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. The band is credited for inventing the alternative metal genre which began in the 1980s and that fuses metal with other genres, including alternative rock. Tim Grierson of About.com said the band &quot;helped put alternative metal on the map.&quot; Faith No More has also been credited for influencing nu metal bands, such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Sevendust, primarily due to the popularity of &quot;Epic&quot;, and other early material that featured rap and rock crossovers. Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, a self-confessed fan of the band, stated in a 2015 interview &quot;They fused some of that hip-hop and rock together. They were one of the earliest bands to do that, and definitely pioneers to a whole genre. If you listen to Korn, if you listen to how the bass and the drums lock up, it&#x27;s quite similar to how Faith No More was doing it in their early years.&quot; Papa Roach guitarist Jerry Horton also listed Faith No More as a major influence when the band was starting out. In a 2019 interview on the Australian channel Rage&#x27;s Midnight Show, Tobias Forge, leader of the Swedish rock band Ghost, explained what the band meant to him by saying, &quot;In the 90s there were a few bands that I liked a lot, and still like to this day, that are consecutively hard to niche. One band is Faith No More. Who knows what they play? No one knows really. It&#x27;s a synth band? No. Is it a heavy metal band? No, not really. It&#x27;s just a really, really good rock band.&quot;

The band and their 1990 single &quot;Epic&quot; have frequently been cited as an example of an &#x27;80s or &#x27;90s one-hit wonder. &quot;Flavorwire&quot; stated in 2014 &quot;Although the band always had a loyal fan base and Patton remains an indie hero, they only cracked the Billboard Hot 100 once, with Epic.&quot; Others have noted that after &quot;Epics success, the band still managed to remain highly popular in regions outside North America: including Australia, South America, Europe and the U.K. The band&#x27;s original final record &quot;Album of the Year&quot; notably experienced high sales in countries such as Australia (where it went platinum), New Zealand and Germany, while being deemed a commercial failure in their native USA.

=== Covers and tributes ===
Faith No More have been covered by prominent metal acts such as 36 Crazyfists, Apocalyptica, Atreyu, Between the Buried and Me, Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Helloween, Ill Niño, Korn, Machine Head, Papa Roach, Redemption, Revocation, Sentenced, Slaves on Dope and Trail of Tears. Slaves on Dope wrote and recorded the song &quot;No More Faith&quot; as a tribute to Faith No More; they also chose to record a cover of &quot;War Pigs&quot; because Faith No More had done it. 

In October 2000, a tribute album organized by Faith No More&#x27;s former manager Warren Entner was first announced. It was set to feature principally high-profile nu-metal and alternative metal bands, including Papa Roach (covering &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot;), Korn (covering &quot;Surprise! You&#x27;re Dead!&quot;), Disturbed (covering &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;), Taproot (covering &quot;Ricochet&quot;), Deftones (covering &quot;RV&quot;), Primer 55 (covering &quot;Digging the Grave&quot;), System of a Down (covering &quot;Cuckoo for Caca&quot;), as well as Fear Factory, Slipknot, Incubus, and Slaves on Dope. Though several of the bands recorded their songs, a record label was never set and this tribute was never released. Papa Roach notably performed &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot; during its 2001 European tour, while Disturbed performed &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; on its 2001 North American headlining tour. In reaction to the news of this Various Artists tribute, Patton posted the following on his Ipecac Recordings website on February 20, 2001: &quot;FNM Tribute Record - ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Who cares? Do you really want to hear bands ruin great songs? Mike&#x27;s reaction... &quot;let sleeping dogs lie&quot;&quot; In a July 2003 interview with &quot;CounterCulture&quot;, when asked about this tribute Patton responded &quot;No idea. Don&#x27;t really care as long as I get my cut.&quot;

In 2002, another tribute album, titled &quot;Tribute of the Year: A Tribute to Faith No More&quot; (a reference to Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Year&quot;), was released compiled by Legion Records and released by Underground Inc. It features 30 Faith No More songs covered by mostly underground and independent hardcore punk, industrial, and alternative metal acts, including Hate Dept., Tub Ring, Bile, and Yellow No. 5. 

In 2023, The Lucid along with Violent J (Insane Clown Posse) released a re-imagining of &quot;Epic&quot; titled &quot;Sweet Toof&quot;; keeping the music unchanged but re-writing all lyrics and vocal melodies except for a callback to the original chorus during the outro.

===Feud with the Red Hot Chili Peppers===
After the release of &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, a feud developed between Faith No More and fellow funk-influenced Californian group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour, while Chuck Mosley was still Faith No More&#x27;s lead singer. Patton and Chili Peppers&#x27; frontman Anthony Kiedis have been involved in a near 35-year old feud stemming from his accusations of Patton imitating his mannerisms and image for Faith No More&#x27;s 1989 music video &quot;Epic&quot;. Much of the animosity of Patton&#x27;s feud with Kiedis involved his other band Mr Bungle, with very few recent comments attacking Faith No More. Over the years, media attention often exaggerated tensions between the two bands, including TV personalities such as Greg Gutfeld. Despite this, various members of Faith No More and Red Hot Chili Peppers appear to have remained on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated in a 1996 interview, &quot;There was never any fight between us, that was a bunch of bullshit created by the media. I mean I think they&#x27;re a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer [Patton], but it all means nothing to me. [...] Those guys in the band are nice people and there&#x27;s no fight, let&#x27;s not fight.&quot; At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, Red Hot Chili Peppers also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;.

<doc id="142809" wikidata="Q19198" url="?curid=142809" title="Chester Bennington">
<text>Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 – July 20, 2017) was an American singer who was the lead vocalist of the rock band Linkin Park. He was also the lead vocalist of Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise, and Stone Temple Pilots at various points.

Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the bestselling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales. He continued as the band&#x27;s lead vocalist for their next six studio albums, from &quot;Meteora&quot; (2003) to &quot;One More Light&quot; (2017), with each charting within the top three spots of the Billboard 200.

Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Out of Ashes&quot;, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record &quot;High Rise&quot; on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as &quot;Crank&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2009), and &quot;Saw 3D&quot; (2010).

Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. The coroner concluded that his death was a result of suicide by hanging. &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the &quot;Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.&quot; Bennington has been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation. Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington &quot;turned nu-metal universal.&quot;

==Early life==
Chester Charles Bennington was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 20, 1976, to a mother who worked as a nurse and a father who investigated child sexual abuse cases as a police detective. He had two sisters and an older brother. Bennington took an interest in music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations. He dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots, and would later become their lead singer for a time. At age seven, an older male friend sexually abused him. Bennington was afraid to ask for help, not wanting people to think he was gay or a liar, and the abuse continued until age 13. Years later, he revealed the abuser&#x27;s name to his father but chose not to press charges.

Bennington&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 11 years old. The abuse and his situation at home affected him so much that he felt the urge to &quot;kill everybody and run away&quot;. To comfort himself, Bennington drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs. After the divorce, his father gained custody of him. Bennington started using alcohol, marijuana, opium, cocaine, meth, and LSD. He was bullied in high school, stating in an interview that he was &quot;knocked around like a rag doll at school, for being skinny and looking different&quot;. In 1993, at the age of 17, Bennington moved in with his mother. He was banned from leaving the house for a time when she discovered his drug use. He worked at a local Burger King before starting his career as a professional musician.

==Career==
===Early acts===

Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends?, and together they released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a post-grunge band called Grey Daze. The band recorded a demo in 1993 and two albums: &quot;Wake Me&quot; in 1994, and &quot;...No Sun Today&quot; in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998.

===Linkin Park===
Bennington had been frustrated and nearly quit his musical career altogether until Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&amp;R at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park (then known as Xero). He quit his day job at a digital services firm and traveled to California for the audition, in which he successfully won a place in the band. He left his own birthday party early to record his audition. Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band&#x27;s other vocalist, made significant progress together but failed to find a record deal and faced numerous rejections. Blue, who had since become vice president of A&amp;R at Warner Records, intervened again to help the band sign with the label.

On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, through Warner Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; based on some early material. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as &quot;everyday emotions you talk about and think about&quot;. Bennington later described the songwriting experience to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in early 2002, &quot;It&#x27;s easy to fall into that thing – &#x27;poor, poor me&#x27;, that&#x27;s where songs like &#x27;Crawling&#x27; come from: I can&#x27;t take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don&#x27;t say &#x27;you&#x27; at any point. It&#x27;s about how I&#x27;m the reason that I feel this way. There&#x27;s something inside me that pulls me down.&quot;

Bennington was Linkin Park&#x27;s primary lead vocalist, but he occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. &quot;All Music Guide&quot; described Bennington&#x27;s vocals as &quot;higher-pitched&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;, in contrast to Shinoda&#x27;s hip-hop-style delivery. Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band&#x27;s songs.

&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000) was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Meteora&quot; (2003), reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, as did its third album, &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; (2007). Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.

===Dead by Sunrise===
In 2005, Bennington co-founded Dead by Sunrise, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California, with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck. Dead by Sunrise made their live debut in May 2008, performing at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona.

The band released their lone album, &quot;Out of Ashes&quot;, on October 13, 2009.

===Stone Temple Pilots===

In February 2013, Stone Temple Pilots parted ways with long-time lead singer Scott Weiland. The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington took the stage at KROQ&#x27;s Weenie Roast with the band. The setlist included original Stone Temple Pilots songs, as well as their first single with Bennington on vocals called &quot;Out of Time&quot;, which debuted on May 19 and was available for free download via their official website. It was later announced by Bennington and the band in an exclusive KROQ interview that he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility of a new album and tour. The song &quot;Out of Time&quot; is featured on their EP &quot;High Rise&quot;, which was released on October 8, 2013.

Bennington reflected on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, &quot;Every band has its own kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening to these guys. When this opportunity came up, it was just like a no-brainer.&quot; Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015 and was replaced two years later by Jeff Gutt.

===Other works===
In 2005, Bennington appeared on &quot;Walking Dead&quot;, the lead single from turntablist Z-Trip&#x27;s debut album &quot;Shifting Gears&quot;. Bennington also made a surprise guest appearance during Z-Trip&#x27;s performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2005. Bennington re-recorded the Mötley Crüe song &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; as a duet with the band as a charity single for the victims of Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005. He also joined Alice in Chains and performed the song &quot;Man in the Box&quot; at KROQ&#x27;s Inland Invasion Festival in 2006. Bennington performed with Kings of Chaos during their six-show 2016 concert tour.

In 2007, he was featured on Young Buck&#x27;s song &quot;Slow Ya Roll&quot; from his &quot;Buck The World&quot; album. Bennington recorded a track for Slash&#x27;s 2010 eponymous debut solo album entitled &quot;Crazy&quot; but it was blocked from release due to his commitments to Linkin Park with Slash stating that the band &quot;wasn&#x27;t having it&quot;. Slash rerecorded it with Lemmy on vocals and the retitled &quot;Doctor Alibi&quot; was added instead. In May 2021, a snippet of the original Bennington track was finally released. 

==Musical style and influences==
Bennington was described as being a &quot;warm tenor&quot;, with his voice showing &quot;tremendous durability&quot; for the entirety of his career. Althea Legaspi of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Bennington&#x27;s voice embodied the anguish and wide-ranging emotions of the lyrics, from capturing life&#x27;s vulnerable moments to the fury and catharsis found in his belted screams, which he would often move between at the turn of a dime.&quot;

Bennington stated that he was influenced by Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains, Arcade Fire, Circle Jerks, Descendents, Deftones, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Metallica, Fugazi, Refused, Ministry, Minor Threat, Misfits, The Naked and Famous, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Skinny Puppy, Soundgarden, and A Tribe Called Quest. Bennington also considered himself as &quot;a huge Madonna fan&quot;, crediting her for making him grow up wanting to be a musician.

==Personal life==
===Family and views===
Bennington had a son, born in 1996, from his relationship with Elka Brand. In 2006, he adopted Brand&#x27;s other son who was born in 1997. He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996. They had one child together, Draven, born in 2002. Bennington&#x27;s relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005. 

In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former &quot;Playboy&quot; model with whom he had three children, the first born in 2006, and then twins, born in 2011. Chester and Talinda Bennington were harassed by a cyberstalker, who was later found guilty in 2008 of tampering with the couple&#x27;s email and other personal information, as well as sending threatening messages, and was sentenced to two years in prison.

Bennington was a tattoo enthusiast. He had done work and promotions with Club Tattoo, a tattoo parlor in Tempe, Arizona. Club Tattoo is owned by Sean Dowdell, Bennington&#x27;s friend since high school with whom he played in two bands.

Bennington was an avid sports fan and supported NBA team Phoenix Suns, NFL&#x27;s Arizona Cardinals, MLB&#x27;s Arizona Diamondbacks, NHL&#x27;s Arizona Coyotes, and English football team Ipswich Town.

In a January 2011 interview, in response to the 2011 Tucson shooting, Bennington said, &quot;There&#x27;s a non-violent way to express yourself and get your point across – regardless of what you&#x27;re saying or what your point is. In a free society, people have a right to believe whatever they want to believe. That&#x27;s their business and they can speak their mind. But nobody, even in a free society, has the right to take another person&#x27;s life. Ever. That&#x27;s something that we really need to move beyond.&quot;

Bennington was a critic of U.S. president Donald Trump. On January 29, 2017, he tweeted that Trump was &quot;a greater threat to the USA than terrorism&quot;. This tweet resurfaced in July 2020 after Linkin Park sent Trump a cease and desist order for using &quot;In the End&quot; in an ad for his re-election campaign that year.

===Health and injuries===
Bennington was plagued with poor health during the making of &quot;Meteora&quot;, and struggled to attend some of the album&#x27;s recording sessions. In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues while filming the music video for &quot;Numb&quot; in Prague. He was forced to return to the United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.

Bennington sustained a wrist injury in October 2007 while attempting to jump off a platform during a show in Melbourne at the Rod Laver Arena. Despite the injury, he continued to perform the entire show with a broken wrist, before heading to an emergency department, where he received five stitches.

In 2011, Bennington fell ill again, and Linkin Park was forced to cancel three shows and reschedule two from the A Thousand Suns World Tour. He injured his shoulder during the band&#x27;s tour in Asia and was advised by doctors to have immediate surgery, canceling their final show at Pensacola Beach, Florida, and ending their tour.

Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse. He overcame his drug addiction and denounced drug use in later interviews. He battled with alcoholism during his tenure with Linkin Park, which he overcame following an intervention from his bandmates. In 2011, he said he had quit drinking, noting: &quot;I just don&#x27;t want to be that person anymore.&quot;

Bennington injured his ankle in January 2015 during a basketball game. He attempted to cope with the injury and perform with the aid of crutches and a knee scooter. Linkin Park later canceled the remainder of their tour to allow Bennington to undergo surgery and recover.

===Friendship with Chris Cornell===
Bennington was a close friend of Chris Cornell. They became friends during a tour they shared in the mid-2000s. The chemistry between the two strengthened during the 2007–2008 Projekt Revolution Tour when Bennington joined Cornell on stage to sing Temple of the Dog&#x27;s &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, and then Cornell joined Linkin Park to sing &quot;Crawling&quot;. Bennington was also the godfather of Cornell&#x27;s son Christopher.

Cornell died by suicide on May 18, 2017. Bennington wrote an open letter to Cornell on Instagram, stating that he could not imagine a world without Cornell in it. Shinoda noted that Bennington was very emotional when the band performed &quot;One More Light&quot; in Cornell&#x27;s honor on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and Bennington could not finish singing the song during rehearsal due to this. The band was due to record a live performance of their single &quot;Heavy&quot; on the show, but Bennington decided instead to play &quot;One More Light&quot; after hearing the news about Cornell&#x27;s death.

On May 26, 2017, a week after his &quot;Kimmel&quot; performance, Bennington sang Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; at Cornell&#x27;s funeral in Los Angeles with Brad Delson on guitar.

==Death==

On July 20, 2017, at the age of 41, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. Authorities ruled his death as suicide by hanging. No suicide note was left and toxicology reports only found a trace amount of alcohol in his system.

After Bennington&#x27;s death, Linkin Park canceled the rest of their One More Light World Tour and refunded tickets. Bennington&#x27;s funeral was held on July 29 at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes. In addition to his family members and close friends, many musicians who toured or played with Linkin Park also attended. The service also included a full stage for musical tributes.

===Remembrances and tributes===
Bennington filmed an episode of &quot;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&quot; six days before his death. Bennington&#x27;s family allowed the episode to be aired on October 12, 2017. On August 27, during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to Bennington and Chris Cornell. Some of his former bandmates from Dead by Sunrise and Grey Daze united to perform a tribute for Bennington during a concert on September 2 in Las Vegas. Linkin Park also hosted a public tribute for Bennington in Los Angeles on October 27, titled Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington. The event featured the band&#x27;s first performance following his death, along with performances from Blink-182, members of System of a Down, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, Bring Me the Horizon, Sum 41, Yellowcard, and the singer Kiiara, among others.

Rapper Jay-Z paid tribute to Bennington on several occasions by performing &quot;Numb/Encore&quot; live. Jay-Z and Bennington (with Linkin Park) collaborated on the song. Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin paid tribute to Bennington during the band&#x27;s North American tour concert at MetLife Stadium, playing an acoustic version of &quot;Crawling&quot; on piano. Several other artists, including Muse, Ryan Key (lead vocalist and guitarist of Yellowcard), Machine Gun Kelly, Imagine Dragons, Billy Talent and Godsmack, also either covered Linkin Park songs (usually &quot;Crawling&quot;) or played their own songs during concerts as tribute to Bennington in the days and months following his death. During the 60th Annual Grammy Awards&#x27;s annual in memoriam tribute, rapper Logic performed the song &quot;1-800-273-8255&quot; live alongside Alessia Cara and Khalid as a tribute to both Cornell and Bennington. The song&#x27;s title is the phone number of the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline.

Producer Markus Schulz made a trance remix of the Linkin Park song &quot;In the End&quot; as tribute to Bennington after his death, which he debuted at Tomorrowland.

Bennington and other late musicians were honored in the music video for &quot;Hold on to Memories&quot; by Disturbed.

Following Bennington&#x27;s death, Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst said that Bennington &quot;had a way of making anyone he spoke to feel heard, understood and significant. His aura and spirit were contagious and empowering. Often those types of people have so much pain and torture inside that the last thing they want is to contaminate or break the spirit of others... As real and transparent as our conversations would be, he was always the one projecting light on the shadows.&quot;

===Aftermath===
Linkin Park went on hiatus following Bennington&#x27;s death in 2017, during which the band did not tour or work on new music. The band instead released 20th-anniversary reissues of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2020) and &quot;Meteora&quot; (2023), along with &quot;Papercuts&quot; (2024), a greatest hits album. On September 5, 2024, Linkin Park announced they would reunite after a seven-year hiatus to release a new album, &quot;From Zero&quot;, which was released November 15, 2024. It was supported by a six-date international tour. The band also introduced two new members, new co-lead vocalist Emily Armstrong (in place of Bennington) and new drummer Colin Brittain (in place of Rob Bourdon).

==Legacy==
Several publications have commented on the musical legacy Bennington left behind. While describing the success of Bennington and Linkin Park, AllMusic&#x27;s Andrew Leahey said, &quot;Although rooted in alternative metal, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the 2000s by welcoming elements of hip-hop, modern rock, and atmospheric electronica into their music ...focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda.&quot; Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington &quot;turned nu-metal universal&quot;, as he was &quot;clearly an important conduit for his far-ranging audience&quot;.

Fred Durst, lead singer of Limp Bizkit, stated that if it were not for Bennington&#x27;s voice and his words, nu metal &quot;would never have reached the masses and affected so many lives&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Jon Caramanica commented that Bennington&#x27;s ability to &quot;pair serrated rawness with sleek melody&quot; separated him from other contemporary singers, and also from the artists he was influenced by. Caramanica noted, &quot;He was an emo sympathizer in a time when heavy metal was still setting the agenda for mainstream hard rock, and a hip-hop enthusiast who found ways to make hip-hop-informed music that benefited from his very un-hip-hop skill set.&quot; As Bennington acquired influences from industrial and hardcore punk acts, the journalist believed this was the factor that made Linkin Park survive the &quot;rise and precipitous fall of the rap-rock era&quot;, calling the musician &quot;a rock music polymath&quot;. Mikael Wood of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; argued, &quot;Perhaps more than Linkin Park&#x27;s influential sound, Bennington&#x27;s real artistic legacy will be the message he put across – the reassurance he offered from the dark.&quot;

BBC&#x27;s Steve Holden called Bennington the &quot;voice of a generation&quot;, saying his voice was arguably Linkin Park&#x27;s greatest asset. Jonathan McAloon of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented, &quot;Bennington&#x27;s death will have an impact on many millennials because his voice was the sound of their millennium.&quot; While talking about Linkin Park&#x27;s popularity, Corey Apar, of AllMusic, commented, &quot;Bennington&#x27;s oft-tortured vocals became one of the most distinctive in the alternative rock scene.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted, &quot;Bennington&#x27;s decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable.&quot; The journalist continued to discuss Bennington&#x27;s impact, commenting,

James Hingle echoed this sentiment, writing for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;[Bennington] was one of the most honest vocalists out there when it came to his mental health&quot;. In the same topic, William Goodman from &quot;Billboard&quot; said Bennington and fellow musicians Chris Cornell and Scott Weiland &quot;helped define a generation of the hard rock sound, who were tied together artistically and personally&quot;.

&quot;The Straits Times&quot;″ music correspondent Eddino Abdul Hadi stated Bennington was an inspiration to many artists in the Singapore music scene. Calum Slingerland, editor of the Canadian periodical &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, expressed, &quot;[H]is influence has been felt in the worlds of rock, metal, rap, and beyond.&quot;

After Bennington&#x27;s death, his widow Talinda Bennington launched a campaign called 320 Changes Direction in honor of her husband to help break the stigma surrounding mental illness.

In 2020, during a Twitch live-stream, Mike Shinoda confirmed the existence of an unreleased Linkin Park song, titled &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, which features vocal tracks Bennington recorded during the &quot;One More Light&quot; sessions. The song was released on February 23, 2024. At the time of his death, Bennington just finished a collaboration with Lamb of God guitarist Mark Morton for Morton&#x27;s solo album &quot;Anesthetic&quot; entitled &quot;Cross Off&quot;; Morton later said in interviews that Bennington was &quot;very, very excited about the idea of screaming and doing something heavier than what he&#x27;s been doing lately&quot;. The music video for &quot;Cross Off&quot; later featured an empty microphone as a tribute to Bennington.

During an interview with Zane Lowe in 2024, Bennington&#x27;s successor in Linkin Park, Emily Armstrong, called the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; her favorite album and specifically cited Bennington&#x27;s performance in the song &quot;One Step Closer&quot; as her inspiration to be a singer, commenting, &quot;That was the moment I was like, &#x27;I want to sing and scream&#x27;, you know? &#x27;One Step Closer&#x27;, I was like, &#x27;I could do that&#x27;. At the time I wasn&#x27;t even a good singer. I was a guitar player in a band, you know? . . . And obviously, on the side of the feelings and the emotions of it, like, I would love to do him proud.&quot;

<text>Joseph Hahn (born March 15, 1977) is an American musician, DJ, director, and visual artist best known as the DJ and creative director of the rock band Linkin Park, doing the scratching, turntables, sampling, and programming for all eight of Linkin Park&#x27;s albums. Hahn and bandmate Mike Shinoda are responsible for most of Linkin Park&#x27;s album artwork. Hahn also directed many of the band&#x27;s music videos.

== Early life and education ==

Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Hahn was born the youngest of three children in Dallas; Hahn has two older sisters. Hahn is a second-generation Korean American, and he grew up in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood of Glendale, California. As a child, Hahn played the violin for a few years in school, then also tried out the guitar for a bit.

Hahn graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in Glendale. He then studied at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena but did not graduate.

==Career ==

Hahn began deejaying in high school, and he studied illustration at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. In college, he met Mike Shinoda and joined his band Xero, which would release its self-titled demo album in 1997. The band later became known as Hybrid Theory in 1999 with the EP release of the same name as the band, then was changed again into Linkin Park during the recording sessions of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. Hahn and Shinoda guested in the X-Ecutioners&#x27; hit single &quot;It&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Down&quot;. Hahn also guest starred in Shinoda&#x27;s Fort Minor&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Rising Tied&quot; on the song &quot;Slip Out the Back&quot;.

Hahn was called Chairman Hahn on the back cover of Linkin Park&#x27;s first remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot; next to the remixes of the songs &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot;, titled &quot;Wth&gt;You&quot; and &quot;Kyur4 TH Ich&quot;, respectively. Hahn has directed several of Linkin Park&#x27;s music videos, such as those for &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;From the Inside&quot;, &quot;What I&#x27;ve Done&quot;, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot;, &quot;New Divide&quot;, &quot;Bleed It Out&quot; and &quot;Iridescent&quot;. He has also directed videos for Alkaline Trio, Static-X, Story of the Year, and Xzibit. In a 2003 interview, he told MTV that film-making was his true passion, and that &quot;doing the music [was] more of an extra thing&quot;. He is known to add various dramatic effects to the music videos he directs, such as casting a snake in the video for &quot;Iridescent&quot;.

Outside of his work in music, Hahn provided special effects work on &quot;The X-Files&quot; and the miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;. He also directed a short film called &quot;The Seed&quot; and acquired the rights to produce a film adaptation of China Miéville&#x27;s novel &quot;King Rat&quot;.

Hahn directed the trailer for the video game &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, featuring Linkin Park&#x27;s single &quot;The Catalyst&quot;. Hahn also directed the music video for &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, which premiered on August 26, 2010, as well as the music video for Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for the End&quot; and &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;. On April 13, 2011, Mike Shinoda confirmed on his blog that the music video for &quot;Iridescent&quot; would be directed by Hahn.

Hahn became the first Korean American to receive a Grammy when the band won the 2002 award for Best Hard Rock Performance. In November 2011, Hahn designed a helmet of Formula 1 driver Kamui Kobayashi. As of April 2012, Hahn directed a film adaptation of Eric Bogosian&#x27;s &quot;Mall&quot;, based on the novel, which stars and is executive produced by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio. The musical score for the album was handled by Linkin Park and Alec Puro of Deadsy for the film.

In 2019, he was a judge in the South Korean JTBC talent show &quot;Superband&quot;.

In 2022, Hahn composed the original score for the Samurai movie &quot;Blade of the 47 Ronin&quot; along with co-contributor Alec Puro.

<doc id="142813" wikidata="Q118353099" url="?curid=142813" title="Azalea">
<text>Azaleas ( ) are flowering shrubs in the genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, particularly the former sections &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; (evergreen) and &quot;Pentanthera&quot; (deciduous). Azaleas bloom in the spring (April and May in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, and October and November in the Southern Hemisphere), their flowers often lasting several weeks. Shade tolerant, they prefer living near or under trees. They are part of the family Ericaceae.

==Cultivation==
Plant enthusiasts have selectively bred azaleas for hundreds of years. This human selection has produced thousands of different cultivars which are propagated by cuttings. Azalea seeds can also be collected and germinated.

Azaleas are generally slow-growing and do best in well-drained acidic soil (4.5–6.0 pH). Fertilizer needs are low. Some species need regular pruning.

Azaleas are native to several continents including Asia, Europe and North America. They are planted abundantly as ornamentals in the southeastern US, southern Asia, and parts of southwest Europe.
According to azalea historian Fred Galle, in the United States, &quot;Azalea indica&quot; (in this case, the group of plants called Southern indicas) was first introduced to the outdoor landscape in the 1830s at the rice plantation Magnolia-on-the-Ashley in Charleston, South Carolina. From Philadelphia, where they were grown only in greenhouses, John Grimke Drayton (Magnolia&#x27;s owner) imported the plants for use in his estate garden. With encouragement from Charles Sprague Sargent from Harvard&#x27;s Arnold Arboretum, Magnolia Gardens was opened to the public in 1871, following the American Civil War. Magnolia is one of the oldest public gardens in America. Since the late 19th century, in late March and early April, thousands visit to see the azaleas bloom in their full glory.

== Classification ==

===North American azaleas===

==Disease==
Azalea leafy gall can be particularly destructive to azalea leaves during the early spring. Hand picking infected leaves is the recommended method of control.

They can also be subject to &quot;Phytophthora&quot; root rot in moist, hot conditions.

Azaleas share the economically important disease &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; with more than 3000 other plants.

==Pests==
Azaleas share the Azalea lace bug (&quot;Stephanitis pyrioides&quot;) with many other heath species. Shrewsbury &amp; Raupp 2000 find azaleas can be protected from them by companion planting with an overstory above them.

==Cultural significance and symbolism==

In Chinese culture, the azalea is known as &quot;thinking of home bush&quot; (&quot;sixiang shu&quot;), and is immortalized in the poetry of Du Fu.

The azalea is also one of the symbols of the city of São Paulo, Brazil.

Azaleas and rhododendrons were once so infamous for their toxicity that to receive a bouquet of their flowers in a black vase was a well-known death threat.

==Toxicity==

In addition to being renowned for its beauty, the azalea is also highly toxic—it contains andromedotoxins in both its leaves and nectar, including honey from the nectar. Bees are deliberately fed on Azalea/Rhododendron nectar in some parts of Turkey, producing a mind-altering, potentially medicinal, and occasionally lethal honey known as &quot;mad honey&quot;.
Azalea is dangerous to pets, as, if consumed, the toxins within the plant tissue can cause central nervous system depression, which in turn can lead to multi-organ failure. Symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, laryngeal edema and heart rhythm disturbances, which can lead to complete cardiac arrest and therefore death. Acute kidney failure may also occur.

==Azalea festivals==
===Japan===
Motoyama, Kōchi has a flower festival in which the blooming of Tsutsuji is celebrated. Tatebayashi, Gunma is famous for its Azalea Hill Park, Tsutsuji-ga-oka. 
Nezu Shrine in Bunkyo, Tokyo, holds a Tsutsuji Matsuri from early April until early May.
Higashi Village has hosted an azalea festival each year since 1976. The village&#x27;s 50,000 azalea plants draw an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 visitors each year.

===Korea===

Sobaeksan, one of the 12 well-known Sobaek Mountains, lying on the border between Chungbuk Province and Gyeongbuk has a royal azalea (&quot;Rhododendron schlippenbachii&quot;) festival held on May every year. Sobaeksan has an azalea colony dotted around Biro mountaintop, Gukmang and Yonwha early in May. When royal azaleas have turned pink in the end of May, it looks like Sobaeksan wears a pink Jeogori (Korean traditional jacket).

===Hong Kong===
The Ma On Shan Azalea Festival is held in Ma On Shan, where six native species (&quot;Rhododendron championae&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron farrerae&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron hongkongense&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron moulmainense&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron simiarum&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron simsii&quot; ) are found in the area. The festival has been held since 2004; it includes activities such as exhibitions, photo contests and carnivals.

===United States===

Many cities in the United States have festivals in the spring celebrating the blooms of the azalea, including Summerville, South Carolina; Hamilton, New Jersey; Mobile, Alabama; Jasper, Texas; Tyler, Texas; Norfolk, Virginia; Wilmington, North Carolina (North Carolina Azalea Festival); Valdosta, Georgia; Palatka, Florida (Florida Azalea Festival); Pickens, South Carolina; Muskogee, Oklahoma; Brookings, Oregon; and Nixa, Missouri.

The Azalea Trail is a designated path, planted with azaleas in private gardens, through Mobile, Alabama. The Azalea Trail Run is an annual road running event held there in late March. Mobile, Alabama is also home to the Azalea Trail Maids, fifty women chosen to serve as ambassadors of the city while wearing antebellum dresses, who originally participated in a three-day festival, but now operate throughout the year.

The Azalea Society of America designated Houston, Texas, an &quot;azalea city&quot;. The River Oaks Garden Club has conducted the Houston Azalea Trail every spring since 1935.

Valdosta, Georgia is called the Azalea City, as the plant grows in profusion there. The city hosts an annual Azalea Festival in March.

<doc id="142814" wikidata="Q1383381" url="?curid=142814" title="Queen Pen">
<text>Lynise Walters (born September 24, 1972), known professionally as Queen Pen, is an American rapper. Born in Brooklyn, New York City, she was discovered by producer Teddy Riley at an IHOP restaurant in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Riley later invited her to &quot;spit lyrics&quot; for Blackstreet&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;No Diggity&quot;, which became her and Riley&#x27;s most successful recording (although she was uncredited on many publications of the song). Walters signed with Riley&#x27;s Lil Man Records, an imprint of Interscope Records to release her debut album, &quot;My Melody&quot; (1997), which spawned the single, &quot;All My Love&quot; (featuring Eric Williams) peaking at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album contained production largely handled by Riley and writing contributions from fellow Brooklyn native Jay-Z. 

Her second studio album, &quot;Conversations with Queen&quot; (2001) contained less involvement from both and saw minimal critical or commercial response. She has not released any music afterward and has since become an author.

==Career==

Her music career launched after she became a protégé of Teddy Riley, a producer and member of the R&amp;B group Blackstreet in the mid-1990s. Although she was not listed on the song, she was a featured artist alongside Dr. Dre in Blackstreet&#x27;s 1996 hit, &quot;No Diggity&quot;. She signed to Riley&#x27;s Lil&#x27; Man label and released &quot;My Melody&quot; (1997), her solo debut album, produced by Riley.

Her first album produced the charted singles &quot;Man Behind the Music&quot;, &quot;All My Love&quot;, and &quot;Party Ain&#x27;t a Party&quot;. She also gained notoriety for her song &quot;Girlfriend&quot; (featuring Meshell Ndegeocello), where the lyrics explored same sex relationships. In 1999, she took a three-year hiatus from performing and returned with her second album, &quot;Conversations with Queen&quot; (2001).

==Personal life==
After the release of the single, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, that contained themes that were taboo in the hip hop community at the time, some media sources presumed Queen Pen to be bisexual or a lesbian. During the song&#x27;s release, Queen Pen remained coy about her sexuality and would not disclose it unless it was going to be a &quot;front page&quot; story. She also added that if she told the press she was straight, she would be viewed as a liar; in turn, if she were to say she was gay, she would be viewed as someone trying to get publicity. In 2001, Queen Pen disclosed in an interview that she was neither bisexual nor lesbian. She is now an entrepreneur and novelist. Her sons Donlynn and Quintion are also rappers, who go by the handles Nefu Da Don and Q Nhannaz, respectively.

=== Feud with Foxy Brown ===
In 1998, a dispute between Foxy Brown and Queen Pen developed over her controversial lesbian-themed single &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. Brown, who took offense to the song&#x27;s subject, spewed homophobic remarks at both Pen and former rival Queen Latifah via her diss track &quot;10% Dis&quot;. In response, Pen reportedly confronted Brown while barefoot in the lobby of Nevada&#x27;s Reno Hilton during the Impact Music Convention and tried to slap her and chase her down an elevator. The fight was broken up by producer Derek &quot;DC&quot; Clark and Brown&#x27;s associates Noreaga and Cam&#x27;ron. Later, Queen Pen happened upon Foxy Brown again when Brown was accompanied by ex-lover Kurupt. Again, the conflict was subdued before any further physical contact occurred.

In late 1998, Brown released another diss track titled &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, which contained more homophobic remarks directed at Pen and Queen Latifah. In 2001, Pen responded to the diss track with her record &quot;I Got Cha&quot;, in which Queen Pen called Brown a &quot;bum bitch&quot;, and later made remarks about her being funny and fake &quot;like a drag queen&quot;. Although Queen Pen insisted the song was not about Brown, she responded in an MTV interview: &quot;You make a record about me, I make a record about you. Sooner or later I&#x27;m going to have to punch you in your face.&quot; Shortly after the track&#x27;s release, the feud began to die down, and by July 2006, both Pen and Brown reconciled during an attendance at Russell Simmons&#x27; Hip-Hop Summit.

<text>Naloxone, sold under the brand name Narcan among others, is an opioid antagonist, a medication used to reverse or reduce the effects of opioids. For example, it is used to restore breathing after an opioid overdose. Effects begin within two minutes when given intravenously, five minutes when injected into a muscle, and ten minutes as a nasal spray. Naloxone blocks the effects of opioids for 30 to 90 minutes.

Administration to opioid-dependent individuals may cause symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including restlessness, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a fast heart rate, and sweating. To prevent this, small doses every few minutes can be given until the desired effect is reached. In those with previous heart disease or taking medications that negatively affect the heart, further heart problems have occurred. It appears to be safe in pregnancy, after having been given to a limited number of women. Naloxone is a non-selective and competitive opioid receptor antagonist. It reverses the depression of the central nervous system and respiratory system caused by opioids.
Naloxone was patented in 1961 and approved for opioid overdose in the United States in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==

===Opioid overdose===
Naloxone is useful in treating both acute opioid overdose and respiratory or mental depression due to opioids. Whether it is useful in those in cardiac arrest due to an opioid overdose is unclear.

It is included as a part of emergency overdose response kits distributed to heroin, fentanyl, and other opioid drug users, and to emergency responders. This has been shown to reduce rates of deaths due to overdose. A prescription for naloxone is recommended if a person is on a high dose of opioid (&gt;100mg of morphine equivalence/day), is prescribed any dose of opioid accompanied by a benzodiazepine, or is suspected or known to use opioids nonmedically. Prescribing naloxone should be accompanied by standard education that includes preventing, identifying, and responding to an overdose; rescue breathing; and calling emergency services.

Distribution of naloxone to individuals likely to encounter people who overdose is one aspect of harm reduction strategies.

However, with opioids that have longer half-lives, respiratory depression returns after naloxone has worn off; therefore, adequate dosing and continuous monitoring may be necessary.

===Clonidine overdose===
Naloxone can also be used as an antidote in an overdose of clonidine, a medication that lowers blood pressure. Clonidine overdoses are of special relevance for children, in whom even small doses can cause significant harm. However, there is controversy regarding naloxone&#x27;s efficacy in treating the symptoms of clonidine overdose, namely slow heart rate, low blood pressure, and confusion/somnolence. Case reports that used doses of 0.1mg/kg (maximum of 2mg/dose) repeated every 1–2 minutes (10mg total dose) have shown inconsistent benefit. As the doses used throughout the literature vary, it is difficult to form a conclusion regarding the benefit of naloxone in this setting. The mechanism for naloxone&#x27;s proposed benefit in clonidine overdose is unclear. Still, it has been suggested that endogenous opioid receptors mediate the sympathetic nervous system in the brain and elsewhere in the body.

===Preventing recreational opioid use===
Naloxone is poorly absorbed when taken orally or sublingually, so it is often combined with several oral or sublingual opioid preparations, including buprenorphine and pentazocine, so that when swallowed or taken sublingually, only the non-naloxone opioid has an effect. However, if the combination is injected (such as by dissolving a pill or sublingual strip in water), the naloxone is believed to block the effect of the other opioid. This combination is used to prevent non-medical use.

However, SAMHSA&#x27;s clinical guidelines state that if the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone is injected by a regular user of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone, then the buprenorphine would still produce an agonist effect but the naloxone would fail to produce an antagonist effect. This is because the amount of naloxone that would be required to block the buprenorphine after injection is much larger than the amount that is contained in buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) pills and strips. If someone who is not physically dependent on opioids were to inject the buprenorphine/naloxone combination, then the effects of the buprenorphine may at most be slightly lessened, but the individual would still be expected to experience euphoric effects.

===Other uses===

A 2003 meta-analysis of existing research showed naloxone to improve blood flow in patients with shock, including septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, or spinal shock, but could not determine if this reduced patient deaths.

Oral naloxone has been used for opioid-induced constipation (OIC). A 2018 meta-analysis cites 5 studies that tests it for this purpose. It found that medical treatment for OIC can be more efficacious than placebo, but did not look into the effect of individual treatments such as naloxone. As a result, no conclusion can be drawn from the study on naloxone&#x27;s effectiveness for OIC.

===Special populations===

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====

Whether naloxone is excreted in breast milk is unknown, however, it is not orally bioavailable and therefore is unlikely to affect a breastfeeding infant.

====Children====
Naloxone can be used on infants who were exposed to intrauterine opiates administered to mothers during delivery. However, there is insufficient evidence for the use of naloxone to lower cardiorespiratory and neurological depression in these infants. Infants exposed to high concentrations of opiates during pregnancy may have CNS damage in the setting of perinatal asphyxia. Naloxone has been studied to improve outcomes in this population, however the evidence is currently weak.

Intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous administration of naloxone can be given to children and neonates to reverse opiate effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends only intravenous administration as the other two forms can cause unpredictable absorption. After a dose is given, the child should be monitored for at least 24 hours. For children with low blood pressure due to septic shock, naloxone safety and effectiveness are not established.

====Geriatric use====
For patients 65 years and older, it is unclear if there is a difference in response. However, older people often have decreased liver and kidney function which may lead to an increased level of naloxone in their body.

=== Available forms ===

====Intravenous====
In hospital settings, naloxone is injected intravenously, with an onset of 1–2 minutes and a duration of up to 45 minutes.

====Intramuscular or subcutaneous====
Naloxone can also be administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The onset of naloxone provided through this route is 2 to 5 minutes with a duration of around 30–120min. Naloxone administered intramuscularly are provided through pre-filled syringes, vials, and auto-injector. A hand-held auto-injector is pocket-sized and can be used in non-medical settings such as in the home. It is designed for use by laypersons, including family members and caregivers of opioid users at risk for an opioid emergency, such as an overdose. According to the FDA&#x27;s National Drug Code Directory, a generic version of the auto-injector began to be marketed at the end of 2019.

====Intranasal====
Narcan nasal spray was approved in the US in 2015 and is the first FDA-approved nasal spray for emergency treatment or suspected overdose. It was developed in a partnership between LightLake Therapeutics and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The approval process was fast-tracked. A generic version of the nasal spray was approved in the United States in 2019, though did not come to market until 2021.

In 2021, the FDA approved Kloxxado, an 8mg dose of intranasal naloxone developed by Hikma Pharmaceuticals. Citing the frequent need for multiple 4mg doses of Narcan to successfully reverse overdose, packs of Kloxxado Nasal Spray contain two pre-packaged nasal spray devices, each containing 8mg of naloxone.

However, a wedge device (nasal atomizer) can also be attached to a syringe that may also be used to create a mist to deliver the drug to the nasalmucosa. This is useful near facilities where many overdoses occur that already stock injectors.
==Side effects==

Administration of naloxone to somebody who has used opioids may cause rapid-onset opioid withdrawal.

Naloxone has little to no effect if opioids are not present. In people with opioids in their system, it may cause increased sweating, nausea, restlessness, trembling, vomiting, flushing, and headache, and has in rare cases been associated with heart rhythm changes, seizures, and pulmonary edema.

Naloxone has been shown to block the action of pain-lowering endorphins the body produces naturally. These endorphins likely operate on the same opioid receptors that naloxone blocks. It is capable of blocking a placebo pain-lowering response if the placebo is administered together with a hidden or blind injection of naloxone. Other studies have found that placebo alone can activate the body&#x27;s μ-opioid endorphin system, delivering pain relief by the same receptor mechanism as morphine.

Naloxone should be used with caution in people with cardiovascular disease as well as those who are currently taking medications that could have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system such as causing low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and abnormal heart rhythms. There have been reports of abrupt reversals with opioid antagonists leading to pulmonary edema and ventricular fibrillation.

Use of naloxone to treat people who have been using opioids recreationally may cause acute opioid withdrawal with distressing physiological symptoms such as shivering, tachycardia, and nausea; these in turn may lead to aggression and reluctance to receive further treatment.

Oral naloxone at dose of 4 mg/day produced unacceptable levels of opioid withdrawal.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Naloxone is a lipophilic compound that acts as a non-selective and competitive opioid receptor antagonist. The pharmacologically active isomer of naloxone is (−)-naloxone. Naloxone&#x27;s binding affinity is highest for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), then the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and lowest for the κ-opioid receptor (KOR); naloxone has negligible affinity for the nociceptin receptor.

If naloxone is administered in the absence of concomitant opioid use, no functional pharmacological activity occurs, except the inability of the body to combat pain naturally; since pure mu-opioid antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone block the effects of endorphins. In contrast to direct opiate agonists, which elicit opiate withdrawal symptoms when discontinued in opiate-tolerant people, no evidence indicates the development of tolerance or dependence on naloxone. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but studies suggest it functions to produce withdrawal symptoms by competing for opioid receptors within the brain (a competitive antagonist, not a direct agonist), thereby preventing the action of both endogenous and xenobiotic opioids on these receptors without directly producing any effects itself.

A single administration of naloxone at a relatively high dose of 2mg by intravenous injection has been found to produce brain MOR blockade of 80% at 5minutes, 47% at 2hours, 44% at 4hours, and 8% at 8hours. A low dose (2μg/kg) produced brain MOR blockade of 42% at 5minutes, 36% at 2hours, 33% at 4hours, and 10% at 8hours. Intranasal administration of naloxone via nasal spray has likewise been found to rapidly occupy brain MORs, with peak occupancy occurring at 20minutes, peak occupancies of 67% at a dose of 2mg and 85% with 4mg, and an estimated half-life of occupancy disappearance of approximately 100minutes (1.67hours).

===Pharmacokinetics===
When administered (non-orally or non-rectally, e.g., intravenously or by injection), as is most common, naloxone has a rapid distribution throughout the body. The mean serum half-life has been shown to range from 30 to 81 minutes, shorter than the average half-life of some opiates, necessitating repeat dosing if opioid receptors must be stopped from triggering for an extended period. Naloxone is primarily metabolized by the liver. Its major metabolite is naloxone-3-glucuronide, which is excreted in the urine. For people with liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease or hepatitis, naloxone usage has not been shown to increase serum liver enzyme levels.

Naloxone has low systemic bioavailability when taken by mouth due to hepatic first-pass metabolism, but it does block opioid receptors that are located in the intestine.

==Chemistry==
Naloxone, also known as N-allylnoroxymorphone or as 17-allyl-4,5α-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one, is a synthetic morphinan derivative and was derived from oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone), an opioid analgesic. Oxymorphone, in turn, was derived from morphine, an opioid analgesic and naturally occurring constituent of the opium poppy. Naloxone is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (–)-naloxone (levonaloxone) and (+)-naloxone (dextronaloxone), only the former of which is active at opioid receptors. The drug is highly lipophilic, allowing it to rapidly penetrate the brain and to achieve a far greater brain to serum ratio than that of morphine. Opioid antagonists related to naloxone include cyprodime, nalmefene, nalodeine, naloxol, and naltrexone.

==History==
Naloxone was patented in 1961 by Mozes J. Lewenstein, Jack Fishman, and the company Sankyo. It was approved for opioid use disorder treatment in the United States in 1971.

==Society and culture==

===Misinformation===

Naloxone has been subject to much inaccurate media reporting and many urban legends about it have become prevalent.

One such myth is that naloxone makes the recipient violent. Another is that events called &quot;Lazarus parties&quot; have taken place, in which people reportedly took fatal overdoses in anticipation of being treated with naloxone; in reality this was a fiction spread by the police. Yet another is the claim that people have indulged in &quot;yo-yoing&quot;, whereby they would take naloxone and opioids simultaneously to enjoy an extreme &quot;high&quot; and subsequent revival; the idea is scientifically nonsensical.

===Names===
Naloxone is its international nonproprietary name, British Approved Name, Dénomination Commune Française, Denominazione Comune Italiana, and Japanese Accepted Name, while naloxone hydrochloride is its United States Adopted Name and British Approved Name (Modified).

The patent has expired and it is available as a generic medication. Several formulations use patented dispensers (spray mechanisms or autoinjectors), and patent disputes over the generic forms of the nasal spray were litigated between 2016 and 2020 when a judge ruled in favor of Teva, the generic manufacturer. Teva announced entry of the first generic nasal spray formulation in December 2021. Brand names of naloxone include Narcan, Kloxxado, Nalone, Evzio, Prenoxad Injection, Narcanti, Narcotan, and Zimhi, among others.

===Legal status and availability to law enforcement and emergency personnel===

Naloxone (Nyxoid) was approved for use in the European Union in September 2017.

In the United States, some nasal naloxone are legally available without a prescription.

As of 2019, officials in 29 states had issued standing orders to enable licensed pharmacists to provide naloxone to patients without the individual first visiting a prescriber. Prescribers working with harm reduction or low threshold treatment programs have also issued standing orders to enable these organizations to distribute naloxone to their clients. A standing order, also referred to as a &quot;non-patient specific prescription&quot; is written by a physician, nurse or other prescriber to authorize medicine distribution outside the doctor-patient relationship. In the case of naloxone, these orders are meant to facilitate naloxone distribution to people using opioids, and their family members and friends. Over 200 naloxone distribution programs utilize licensed prescribers to distribute the drug through such orders, or through the authority of pharmacists (as with California&#x27;s legal provision, AB1535).

Laws and policies in many US jurisdictions have been changed to allow wider distribution of naloxone. In addition to laws or regulations permitting distribution of medicine to at-risk individuals and families, some 36 states have passed laws that provide naloxone prescribers with immunity against both civil and criminal liabilities. While paramedics in the US have carried naloxone for decades, law enforcement officers in many states throughout the country carry naloxone to reverse the effects of heroin overdoses when reaching the location before paramedics. As of 12 July 2015, law enforcement departments in 28 US states are allowed to or required to carry naloxone to quickly respond to opioid overdoses. Programs training fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US, and efforts to integrate opioid fatality prevention into emergency response have grown due to the US overdose crisis.

Following the use of the nasal spray device by police officers on Staten Island in New York, an additional 20,000 police officers will begin carrying naloxone in mid-2014. The state&#x27;s Office of the Attorney General will provide US$1.2 million to supply nearly 20,000 kits. Police Commissioner William Bratton said: &quot;Naloxone gives individuals a second chance to get help&quot;. Emergency Medical Service Providers (EMS) routinely administer naloxone, except where basic Emergency Medical Technicians are prohibited by policy or by state law. In efforts to encourage citizens to seek help for possible opioid overdoses, many states have adopted Good Samaritan laws that provide immunity against certain criminal liabilities for anybody who, in good faith, seeks emergency medical care for either themselves or someone around them who may be experiencing an opioid overdose.

States including Vermont and Virginia have developed programs that mandate the prescription of naloxone when a prescription has exceeded a certain level of morphine milliequivalents per day as preventative measures against overdose. Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in North Carolina, and have been replicated in the US military.

In Canada, naloxone single-use syringe kits are distributed and available at various clinics and emergency rooms. Alberta Health Services is increasing the distribution points for naloxone kits at all emergency rooms, and various pharmacies and clinics province-wide. All Edmonton Police Service and Calgary Police Service patrol cars carry an emergency single-use naloxone syringe kit. Some Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol vehicles also carry the drug, occasionally in excess to help distribute naloxone among users and concerned family/friends. Nurses, paramedics, medical technicians, and emergency medical responders can also prescribe and distribute the drug. As of February 2016, pharmacies across Alberta and some other Canadian jurisdictions are allowed to distribute single-use take-home naloxone kits or prescribe the drug to people using opioids.

Following Alberta Health Services, Health Canada reviewed the prescription-only status of naloxone, resulting in plans to remove it in 2016, making naloxone more accessible. Due to the rising number of drug deaths across the country, Health Canada proposed a change to make naloxone more widely available to Canadians in support of efforts to address the growing number of opioid overdoses. In March 2016, Health Canada did change the prescription status of naloxone, as &quot;pharmacies are now able to proactively give out naloxone to those who might experience or witness an opioid overdose.&quot;

===Community access===
In a survey of US laypersons in December 2021, most people believed the scientifically supported idea that trained bystanders can reverse overdoses with naloxone.

A survey of US naloxone prescription programs in 2010 revealed that 21 out of 48 programs reported challenges in obtaining naloxone in the months leading up to the survey, due mainly to either cost increases that outstripped allocated funding or the suppliers&#x27; inability to fill orders. The approximate cost of a 1ml ampoule of naloxone in the US is estimated to be significantly higher than in most other countries.

Take-home naloxone programs for people who use opioids is underway in many North American cities. CDC estimates that the US programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its use prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths by 2014.

In Australia, some forms of naloxone are available &quot;over the counter&quot; in pharmacies free without a prescription under the Take Home Naloxone programme. &lt;ref name=&quot;doi 10.5694/mja15.01181&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It comes in single-use filled syringe form similar to law enforcement kits as well as nasal sprays. In 2024, those with a prescription can purchase five doses for around AU$32 or just over AU$6 per dose.

In Alberta, in addition to pharmacy distribution, take-home naloxone kits are available and distributed in most drug treatment or rehabilitation centers.

In the European Union, take home naloxone pilots were launched in the Channel Islands and in Berlin in the late 1990s. In 2008, the Welsh Assembly government announced its intention to establish demonstration sites for take-home naloxone, and in 2010, Scotland instituted a national naloxone program. Inspired by North American and European efforts, non-governmental organizations running programs to train drug users as overdose responders and supply them with naloxone are now operational in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, China, Vietnam, and Thailand.

In 2018, a maker of naloxone announced it would provide a free kit including two doses of the nasal spray, as well as educational materials, to each of the 16,568 public libraries and 2,700 YMCAs in the U.S.

<doc id="142821" wikidata="Q269829" url="?curid=142821" title="Placebo">
<text>A placebo ( ) is a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value. Common placebos include inert tablets (like sugar pills), inert injections (like saline), sham surgery, and other procedures.

Placebos are used in randomized clinical trials to test the efficacy of medical treatments. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, any change in the control group is known as the &quot;placebo response&quot;, and the difference between this and the result of no treatment is the &quot;placebo effect&quot;. Placebos in clinical trials should ideally be indistinguishable from so-called verum treatments under investigation, except for the latter&#x27;s particular hypothesized medicinal effect. This is to shield test participants (with their consent) from knowing who is getting the placebo and who is getting the treatment under test, as patients&#x27; and clinicians&#x27; expectations of efficacy can influence results.

The idea of a placebo effect was discussed in 18th century psychology, but became more prominent in the 20th century. Modern studies find that placebos can affect some outcomes such as pain and nausea, but otherwise do not generally have important clinical effects. Improvements that patients experience after being treated with a placebo can also be due to unrelated factors, such as regression to the mean (a statistical effect where an unusually high or low measurement is likely to be followed by a less extreme one). The use of placebos in clinical medicine raises ethical concerns, especially if they are disguised as an active treatment, as this introduces dishonesty into the doctor–patient relationship and bypasses informed consent.

Placebos are also popular because they can sometimes produce relief through psychological mechanisms (a phenomenon known as the &quot;placebo effect&quot;). They can affect how patients perceive their condition and encourage the body&#x27;s chemical processes for relieving pain and a few other symptoms, but have no impact on the disease itself.

==Etymology==
The Latin term (pronounced or ) means &quot;[I] shall be pleasing&quot;. It was used as a name for the Vespers in the Office of the Dead, taken from its incipit, a quote from the Vulgate&#x27;s Psalm 116:9 (Psalm 114:9 in modern bibles), , &quot;[I] shall please the Lord in the land of the living&quot;. From that, a &quot;singer of placebo&quot; became associated with someone who falsely claimed a connection to the deceased to get a share of the funeral meal, and hence a flatterer, and so a deceptive act to please.

==Definitions==
The definition of &quot;placebo&quot; has been debated. One definition states that a treatment process is a placebo when none of the characteristic treatment factors are effective (remedial or harmful) in the patient for a given disease.

In a clinical trial, a &quot;placebo response&quot; is the measured response of subjects to a placebo; the &quot;placebo effect&quot; is the difference between that response and no treatment. The placebo response may include improvements due to natural healing, declines due to natural disease progression, the tendency for people who were temporarily feeling either better or worse than usual to return to their average situations (regression toward the mean), and errors in the clinical trial records, which can make it appear that a change has happened when nothing has changed. It is also part of the recorded response to any active medical intervention.

Measurable placebo effects may be either &quot;objective&quot; (e.g. lowered blood pressure) or &quot;subjective&quot; (e.g. a lowered perception of pain).

==Effects==

Placebo can improve patient-reported outcomes such as pain and nausea. A 2001 meta-analysis of the placebo effect looked at trials in 40 different medical conditions, and concluded the only one where it had been shown to have a significant effect was for pain. Another Cochrane review in 2010 suggested that placebo effects are apparent only in subjective, continuous measures, and in the treatment of pain and related conditions. The review found that placebos do not appear to affect the actual diseases, or outcomes that are not dependent on a patient&#x27;s perception. The authors, Asbjørn Hróbjartsson and Peter C. Gøtzsche, concluded that their study &quot;did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general&quot;. This interpretation has been subject to criticism, as the existence of placebo effects seems undeniable. For example, recent research has linked placebo interventions to improved motor functions in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Other objective outcomes affected by placebos include immune and endocrine parameters, end-organ functions regulated by the autonomic nervous system, and sport performance.

Placebos are believed to be capable of altering a person&#x27;s perception of pain. According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;A person might reinterpret a sharp pain as uncomfortable tingling.&quot;

Measuring the extent of the placebo effect is difficult due to confounding factors. For example, a patient may feel better after taking a placebo due to regression to the mean (i.e. a natural recovery or change in symptoms), but this can be ruled out by comparing the placebo group with a no treatment group (as all the placebo research does). It is harder still to tell the difference between the placebo effect and the effects of response bias, observer bias and other flaws in trial methodology, as a trial comparing placebo treatment and no treatment will not be a blinded experiment. In their 2010 meta-analysis of the placebo effect, Asbjørn Hróbjartsson and Peter C. Gøtzsche argue that &quot;even if there were no true effect of placebo, one would expect to record differences between placebo and no-treatment groups due to bias associated with lack of blinding&quot;.

One way in which the magnitude of placebo analgesia can be measured is by conducting &quot;open/hidden&quot; studies, in which some patients receive an analgesic and are informed that they will be receiving it (open), while others are administered the same drug without their knowledge (hidden). Such studies have found that analgesics are considerably more effective when the patient knows they are receiving them.

===Factors influencing the power of the placebo effect===
A review published in &quot;JAMA Psychiatry&quot; found that, in trials of antipsychotic medications, the change in response to receiving a placebo had increased significantly between 1960 and 2013. The review&#x27;s authors identified several factors that could be responsible for this change, including inflation of baseline scores and enrollment of fewer severely ill patients. Another analysis published in &quot;Pain&quot; in 2015 found that placebo responses had increased considerably in neuropathic pain clinical trials conducted in the United States from 1990 to 2013. The researchers suggested that this may be because such trials have &quot;increased in study size and length&quot; during this time period.

Children seem to have a greater response than adults to placebos.

The administration of the placebos can determine the placebo effect strength. Studies have found that taking more pills would strengthen the effect. Capsules appear to be more influential than pills, and injections are even stronger than capsules.

Some studies have investigated the use of placebos where the patient is fully aware that the treatment is inert, known as an &quot;open-label placebo&quot;. Clinical trials found that open-label placebos may have positive effects in comparison to no treatment, which may open new avenues for treatments, but a review of such trials noted that they were done with a small number of participants and hence should be interpreted with &quot;caution&quot; until further, better-controlled trials are conducted. An updated 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis based on 11 studies also found a significant, albeit slightly smaller overall effect of open-label placebos, while noting that &quot;research on OLPs is still in its infancy&quot;.

If the person dispensing the placebo shows their care towards the patient, is friendly and sympathetic, or has a high expectation of a treatment&#x27;s success, then the placebo is more effectual.

In the 2022 book &quot;Epigenetics and Anticipation&quot; published by Springer, Goli integrates many of the specific and non-specific factors influencing the placebo effect in the perceived healing response formula, developed based on main placebo studies.

=== Depression ===
In 2008, a meta-analysis led by psychologist Irving Kirsch, analyzing data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), concluded that 82% of the response to antidepressants was accounted for by placebos. However, other authors expressed doubts about the used methods and the interpretation of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as the cut-off point for the effect size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data found that the Kirsch study had &quot;important flaws in the calculations&quot;. The authors concluded that although a large percentage of the placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.

Another meta-analysis found that 79% of depressed patients receiving placebo remained well (for 12 weeks after an initial 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants. In the continuation phase however, patients on placebo relapsed significantly more often than patients on antidepressants.

===Psychedelics===
It has been proposed that psychedelics used for therapeutic purposes may act as active &quot;super placebos&quot;.

===Negative effects===
A phenomenon opposite to the placebo effect has also been observed. When an inactive substance or treatment is administered to a recipient who has an expectation of it having a &quot;negative&quot; impact, this intervention is known as a nocebo (Latin = &quot;I shall harm&quot;). A nocebo effect occurs when the recipient of an inert substance reports a negative effect or a worsening of symptoms, with the outcome resulting not from the substance itself, but from negative expectations about the treatment.

Another negative consequence is that placebos can cause side-effects associated with real treatment.

Withdrawal symptoms can also occur after placebo treatment. This was found, for example, after the discontinuation of the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative study of hormone replacement therapy for menopause. Women had been on placebo for an average of 5.7 years. Moderate or severe withdrawal symptoms were reported by 4.8% of those on placebo compared to 21.3% of those on hormone replacement.

==Ethics==
===In research trials===
Knowingly giving a person a placebo when there is an effective treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.

The ethics of placebo-controlled studies have been debated in the revision process of the Declaration of Helsinki. Of particular concern has been the difference between trials comparing inert placebos with experimental treatments, versus comparing the best available treatment with an experimental treatment; and differences between trials in the sponsor&#x27;s developed countries versus the trial&#x27;s targeted developing countries.

Some suggest that existing medical treatments should be used instead of placebos, to avoid having some patients not receive medicine during the trial.

===In medical practice===
The practice of doctors prescribing placebos that are disguised as real medication is controversial. A chief concern is that it is deceptive and could harm the doctor–patient relationship in the long run. While some say that blanket consent, or the general consent to unspecified treatment given by patients beforehand, is ethical, others argue that patients should always obtain specific information about the name of the drug they are receiving, its side effects, and other treatment options. This view is shared by some on the grounds of patient autonomy. There are also concerns that legitimate doctors and pharmacists could open themselves up to charges of fraud or malpractice by using a placebo. Critics also argued that using placebos can delay the proper diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions.

Despite the abovementioned issues, 60% of surveyed physicians and head nurses reported using placebos in an Israeli study, with only 5% of respondents stating that placebo use should be strictly prohibited. A &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; editorial said, &quot;that a patient gets pain relief from a placebo does not imply that the pain is not real or organic in origin...the use of the placebo for &#x27;diagnosis&#x27; of whether or not pain is real is misguided.&quot; A survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo simply because the patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, it would depend on the circumstances.

Referring specifically to homeopathy, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Science and Technology Committee has stated:

In his 2008 book &quot;Bad Science&quot;, Ben Goldacre argues that instead of deceiving patients with placebos, doctors should use the placebo effect to enhance effective medicines. Edzard Ernst has argued similarly that &quot;As a good doctor you should be able to transmit a placebo effect through the compassion you show your patients.&quot; In an opinion piece about homeopathy, Ernst argues that it is wrong to support alternative medicine on the basis that it can make patients feel better through the placebo effect. His concerns are that it is deceitful and that the placebo effect is unreliable. Goldacre also concludes that the placebo effect does not justify alternative medicine, arguing that unscientific medicine could lead to patients not receiving prevention advice.
Placebo researcher Fabrizio Benedetti also expresses concern over the potential for placebos to be used unethically, warning that there is an increase in &quot;quackery&quot; and that an &quot;alternative industry that preys on the vulnerable&quot; is developing.

==Mechanisms==
The mechanism for how placebos could have effects is uncertain. From a sociocognitive perspective, intentional placebo response is attributed to the “ritual effect” that induces anticipation for transition to a better state. A placebo presented as a stimulant may trigger an effect on heart rhythm and blood pressure, but when administered as a depressant, the opposite effect.

===Psychology===
In psychology, the two main hypotheses of the placebo effect are expectancy theory and classical conditioning.

In 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different. According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Similarly, the appearance of effect can result from classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect, and make different kinds of contributions. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those who think a treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those who do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.

Additionally, motivation may contribute to the placebo effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning is derived from the culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment.

===Placebo analgesia===
Functional imaging upon placebo analgesia suggests links to the activation, and increased functional correlation between this activation, in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, orbitofrontal and insular cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, the brainstem&#x27;s periaqueductal gray matter, and the spinal cord.

Since 1978, it has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release of endogenous opioids in the brain. Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray on spinal nociceptive reflexes, while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.

Functional imaging upon placebo analgesia has been summarized as showing that the placebo response is &quot;mediated by &#x27;top-down&#x27; processes dependent on frontal cortical areas that generate and maintain cognitive expectancies. Dopaminergic reward pathways may underlie these expectancies&quot;. &quot;Diseases lacking major &#x27;top-down&#x27; or cortically based regulation may be less prone to placebo-related improvement&quot;.

===Brain and body===
In conditioning, a neutral stimulus saccharin is paired in a drink with an agent that produces an unconditioned response. For example, that agent might be cyclophosphamide, which causes immunosuppression. After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself is able to cause immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response via neural top-down control. Such conditioning has been found to affect a diverse variety of not just basic physiological processes in the immune system but ones such as serum iron levels, oxidative DNA damage levels, and insulin secretion. Recent reviews have argued that the placebo effect is due to top-down control by the brain for immunity and pain. Pacheco-López and colleagues have raised the possibility of &quot;neocortical-sympathetic-immune axis providing neuroanatomical substrates that might explain the link between placebo/conditioned and placebo/expectation responses&quot;. There has also been research aiming to understand underlying neurobiological mechanisms of action in pain relief, immunosuppression, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and depression.

Dopaminergic pathways have been implicated in the placebo response in pain and depression.

==Confounding factors==
Placebo-controlled studies, as well as studies of the placebo effect itself, often fail to adequately identify confounding factors. False impressions of placebo effects are caused by many factors including:
* Regression to the mean (natural recovery or fluctuation of symptoms)
* Additional treatments
* Response bias from subjects, including scaling bias, answers of politeness, experimental subordination, conditioned answers;
* Reporting bias from experimenters, including misjudgment and irrelevant response variables.
* Non-inert ingredients of the placebo medication having an unintended physical effect

==History==

The word placebo was used in a medicinal context in the late 18th century to describe a &quot;commonplace method or medicine&quot; and in 1811 it was defined as &quot;any medicine adapted more to please than to benefit the patient&quot;. Although this definition contained a derogatory implication it did not necessarily imply that the remedy had no effect.

It was recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries that drugs or remedies often were perceived to work best while they were still novel:

Placebos have featured in medical use until well into the twentieth century. An influential 1955 study entitled &quot;The Powerful Placebo&quot; firmly established the idea that placebo effects were clinically important, and were a result of the brain&#x27;s role in physical health. A 1997 reassessment found no evidence of any placebo effect in the source data, as the study had not accounted for regression to the mean.

===Placebo-controlled studies===
The placebo effect makes it more difficult to evaluate new treatments. Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment. The subjects in such trials are blinded as to whether they receive the treatment or a placebo. If a person is given a placebo under one name, and they respond, they will respond in the same way on a later occasion to that placebo under that name but not if under another.

Clinical trials are often double-blinded so that the researchers also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or placebo treatment. The placebo effect in such clinical trials is weaker than in normal therapy since the subjects are not sure whether the treatment they are receiving is active.

<doc id="142822" wikidata="Q827375" url="?curid=142822" title="The Green Goddess (1930 film)">
<text>The Green Goddess is a 1930 American pre-Code film directed by Alfred E. Green. It was a remake of the 1923 silent film, which was in turn based on the play of the same name by William Archer. It was produced by Warner Bros. using their new Vitaphone sound system, and adapted by Julien Josephson.

It stars George Arliss, Alice Joyce (in her final film role), Ralph Forbes and H.B. Warner. Arliss and Ivan F. Simpson played the same parts in all three productions, while Joyce reprised her role from the earlier film. Arliss was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance.

==Plot==
A small plane carrying three British citizens — Major Crespin (H.B. Warner), his estranged wife Lucilla (Alice Joyce), and pilot Dr. Traherne (Ralph Forbes) — becomes lost and is forced to crash land in the tiny realm of Rukh, somewhere near the Himalaya Mountains. The Raja (George Arliss) who rules the land welcomes them.

As it happens, the Raja&#x27;s three brothers are soon to be executed for murder by the British. When the three plane-crash survivors appear, the Raja&#x27;s subjects become convinced that their Green Goddess has delivered three victims into their hands for revenge. The three are to be killed once the Raja&#x27;s three brothers are dead. The Raja professes no great love for his brothers, as they had posed a danger to the succession of his own children, but he sees no reason to anger his people by protecting his British guests. When he becomes attracted to Lucilla, however, he offers to spare her life if she will become his wife. She refuses.

The prisoners become aware that the Raja has a telegraph, operated by the Raja&#x27;s renegade British exile and chief assistant, Watkins (Ivan F. Simpson). Hoping to send for help, they try to bribe Watkins, but when they realize he is only leading them on, they throw him off the balcony to his death. Major Crespin manages to send a message before the Raja&#x27;s men break into the room. The Raja personally shoots Crespin in the back, killing him in mid-transmission.

The next day, Traherne and Lucilla are taken to the temple of the Green Goddess. Once more, the Raja renews his offer to Lucilla, but is again turned down. Given a moment alone, Traherne and Lucilla confess their love for each other. Then, in the nick of time, six British biplanes appear in the skies over Rukh. Lt. Cardew (Reginald Sheffield) lands and demands the release of the couple. The Raja gives in.

==Cast==
* George Arliss as The Raja
* Ralph Forbes as Dr. Traherne
* H.B. Warner as Major Crespin
* Alice Joyce as Lucilla
* Ivan F. Simpson as Watkins
* Reginald Sheffield as Lieutenant Cardew
* Betty Boyd as An Ayah
* Nigel De Brulier as Temple Priest

==Production== 
&quot;The Green Goddess&quot; was filmed in 1929 and completed before &quot;Disraeli&quot; (1929) but was held out of release until later at the request of George Arliss because he felt that &quot;Disraeli&quot; was a better vehicle for his sound debut.

&quot;The Green Goddess&quot; first was adapted for cinema in 1923. Produced by Distinctive Productions, it was directed by Sidney Olcott and played by George Arliss, Alice Joyce and Jetta Goudal.

==Adaptations to radio==
&quot;The Green Goddess&quot; was adapted as a one-hour radio play on the January 6, 1935 broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, starring Claude Rains.

It was adapted to radio again by Orson Welles on The Campbell Playhouse on February 10, 1939 with Welles as The Rajah and Madeleine Carroll as Lucille.

==Preservation status==
*The film survives with copies at the Library of Congress and Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research.

<text>This list of Australian Aboriginal group names includes names and collective designations which have been applied, either currently or in the past, to groups of Aboriginal Australians. The list does not include Torres Strait Islander peoples, who are ethnically, culturally and linguistically distinct from Australian Aboriginal peoples, although also an Indigenous Australian people.

Typically, Aboriginal Australian mobs are differentiated by language groups. Most Aboriginal people could name a number of groups of which they are members, each group being defined in terms of different criteria and often with much overlap. Many of the names listed below are properly understood as language or dialect names; some are simply the word meaning &quot;man&quot; or &quot;person&quot; in the associated language; some are endonyms (the name as used by the people themselves) and some exonyms (names used by one group for another, and not by that group itself), while others are demonyms (terms for people from specific geographical areas).

==Notes==
# This name is one of the names used on the widely used &quot;Aboriginal Australia Map&quot;, David Horton (ed.), 1994 published in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia&quot; by AIATSIS. Early versions of the map also divided Australia into 18 regions (Southwest, Northwest, Desert, Kimberley, Fitzmaurice, North, Arnhem, Gulf, West Cape, Torres Strait, East, Rainforest, Northeast, Eyre, Riverine, Southeast, Spencer and Tasmania); the region of the tribes which are depicted in this map are shown in the last column of this table.
# This name is the main name used in Norman Tindale&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes&quot;. Each has a separate article under the name listed there, and alternative names are also listed. In most cases (but not all) the name in the left column &quot;Group name&quot; is also the main name used by Tindale.

<doc id="142829" wikidata="Q1478602" url="?curid=142829" title="Point of no return">
<text>The point of no return (PNR or PONR) is the point beyond which one must continue on one&#x27;s current course of action because turning back is no longer possible, being too dangerous, physically difficult, or prohibitively expensive to be undertaken. The point of no return can be a calculated point during a continuous action (such as in aviation). A particular irreversible action (such as setting off an explosion or signing a contract) can be a point of no return.

== Origins and spread of the expression ==
The phrase &quot;point of no return&quot; originated as a technical term in air navigation to refer to the time and/or location during a flight at which the aircraft no longer has enough fuel to return to its originating airfield. Important decisions may need to be made prior to the point of no return, since it will be unsafe to turn around and fly back if the pilot changes their mind after that point. Otherwise, it may correspond to the aircraft&#x27;s maximal safe range in a situation where the only possible landing site is the takeoff site, for example in the case of an aircraft to an aircraft carrier that is underway and distant from any airfield. In those conditions, an aircraft must always have enough fuel for a return flight, so the &quot;point of no return&quot; may represent the point before which the pilot must return or else risk catastrophe.

It can also mean the instance in which an aircraft taxis down a runway, gaining a certain speed, and must become airborne in lieu of a crash or explosion on the runway (V1 speed)—for example, Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s takeoff in &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; in 1927 in which there was uncertainty about the plane&#x27;s ability to take off from a 5,000-foot mud-soaked runway while fully loaded with aviation fuel.

The first major metaphorical use of the term in popular culture was in the 1947 novel &quot;Point of No Return&quot; by John P. Marquand. It inspired a 1951 Broadway play of the same name by Paul Osborn. The novel and play concern a pivotal period in the life of a New York City banker. In the course of the story, the character faces two &quot;point of no return&quot; realities: first, that his quest for a big promotion will mean either triumph or a dead end to his career, and second, that he can never go back to the small-town life he abandoned as a young man.

==Related expressions==
There are a number of phrases with similar or related meaning:

The point of safe return (F) is the last point on a route at which it is possible to safely return to the departure airfield with the required fuel reserves still available in the tanks. Continuing past the PSR, the aircraft must either land at its intended destination or divert and land at another nearby airfield should an emergency arise.

*&quot;Beyond a certain point there is no return. This point has to be reached.&quot; (Original German: &quot;&quot;) This statement appears in the book (&quot;Reflections on Sin, Suffering, Hope and the True Way&quot;) by Franz Kafka.
*&quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot; is a metaphor for deliberately proceeding past a point of no return. The phrase originates with Julius Caesar&#x27;s seizure of power in the Roman Republic in 49 BC. Roman generals were strictly forbidden from bringing their troops into the home territory of the Republic in Italy. On 10 January, Caesar led his army across the Rubicon River, crossing from the province of Cisalpine Gaul into Italy. After this, if he did not triumph, he would be executed. Therefore, the term &quot;the Rubicon&quot; is used as a synonym to the &quot;point of no return&quot;.
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;The die is cast&quot;), which is reportedly what Caesar said at the crossing of the Rubicon. This metaphor comes from gambling with dice: once the die or dice have been thrown, all bets are irrevocable, even before the dice have come to rest.

The following expressions also express the idea of a point of no return.

*Burn one&#x27;s bridges. This expression is derived from the idea of burning down a bridge after crossing it during a military campaign, leaving no choice but to continue the march. Figuratively, it means to commit oneself to a particular course of action by making an alternative course impossible. It is most often used in reference to deliberately alienating persons or institutions whose cooperation is required for some action. For instance, &quot;On my last day at my old job, I told my boss what I really think about the company. I guess I burned my bridges.&quot;

*Burn one&#x27;s boats. This is a variation of &quot;burning one&#x27;s bridges&quot;, and alludes to certain famous incidents where a commander, having landed in a hostile country, ordered his men to destroy their ships, so that they would have to conquer the country or be killed.
**One such incident was in 711 AD, when Muslim forces invaded the Iberian Peninsula. The commander, Tariq bin Ziyad, ordered his ships to be burned.
**Another such incident was in 1519 AD, during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Hernán Cortés, the Spanish conquistador, scuttled his ships, so that his men would have to conquer or die.
**A third such incident occurred after the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers reached Pitcairn Island.
**Two similar stratagems were used during the Chu–Han Contention (206–202 BCE); these have led to Chinese idioms, elaborated below.
**Another incident is recorded in Burmese history. In the Battle of Naungyo during the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War in 1538, the Toungoo armies led by Gen. Kyawhtin Nawrahta (later Bayinnaung) faced a superior force of Hanthawaddy Kingdom on the other side of a river. After crossing the river on a pontoon bridge (rafts in another version) Bayinnaung ordered the bridge to be destroyed. This action was taken to spur his troops forward in battle and provide a clear signal that there would be no retreat.
*&quot;Break the kettles and sink the boats (破釜沉舟)&quot;. This is an ancient Chinese saying, which refers to Xiang Yu&#x27;s order at the Battle of Julu (207 BC); by fording a river and destroying all means of re-crossing it, he committed his army to a struggle to the end with the Qin and eventually achieved victory.
* &quot;Fighting a battle with one&#x27;s back facing a river&quot; (背水一戰). A similar saying from the same period, which originated in Han Xin&#x27;s order at the Battle of Jingxing (204 BCE).
*&quot;Fait accompli&quot; (&quot;accomplished deed&quot;, from the verb &quot;faire&quot;, to do), a term of French origin denoting an irreversible deed, a done deal.

* Can&#x27;t unring a bell, North American English phrase also denoting an irreversible deed. 
* Physiology: PONR may also refer to the moment, when a human male is sufficiently sexually aroused, beyond which ejaculation will inevitably occur. Recognizing and maintaining arousal approaching the PONR facilitates enhanced physical endurance and can promote a blissful state.
* Line in the sand - an expression to mean that once a decision is made it is not possible to be reversed.
* Red line (phrase) - an expression to mean that if a certain extreme action is taken, consequences would be incurred.
*The arrow has been launched from the bow (&quot;ok yaydan çıktı&quot;). A Turkish expression meaning a path of no return has been taken.

<text>Red Deer is a city in Alberta, Canada, located midway on the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor. Red Deer serves central Alberta, and its key industries include health care, retail trade, construction, oil and gas, hospitality, manufacturing and education. It is surrounded by Red Deer County and borders on Lacombe County. The city is in aspen parkland, a region of rolling hills, alongside the Red Deer River.

== History ==
The area was inhabited by First Nations including the Blackfoot, Plains Cree and Stoney before the arrival of European fur traders in the late eighteenth century. A First Nations trail ran from the Montana Territory across the Bow River near present-day Calgary and on to Fort Edmonton, later known as the Calgary and Edmonton Trail. The trail crossed the Red Deer River at a wide, stony shallows. The &quot;Old Red Deer Crossing&quot; is upstream from the present-day city.

Cree people called the river , which means &quot;Elk River.&quot; European arrivals sometimes called North American elk &quot;red deer,&quot; after the related Eurasian species, and later named the community after the river. The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a calque of the English name (, literally &quot;red type of deer&quot;), while the name of the river itself is still or &quot;elk river.&quot;

First Nations on the north side of the river entered into Treaty 6 in 1876 and on the south side Treaty 7 in 1877. Farmers and ranchers began to settle on the fertile lands.

A trading post and stopping house were built at the Crossing in 1882. This became Fort Normandeau during the 1885 North-West Rebellion.

;Leonard Gaetz
Leonard Gaetz gave a half-share of he had acquired to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first trains arrived in 1891.

;1900 to 1929
Following World War I, Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city.

Bird watcher Elsie Cassels helped to establish the Gaetz Lakes bird sanctuary.

;1930 to 1945
During Great Depression of the 1930s, Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.

In World War II, a large army training camp was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now. Two training airfields were built south of the city at Penhold and Bowden.

;Post–Second World War
Red Deer expanded rapidly following the discovery of major oil reserves in Alberta in the late 1940s. Red Deer became a centre for oil and gas and related industries, such as the Joffre Cogeneration Plant.

North Red Deer was amalgamated in 1948.

Government and administrative services include a hospital, a courthouse and a provincial building.

The railway moved to the outskirts and passenger train service ceased. The CPR bridge is now a walking trail.

Red Deer is Alberta&#x27;s third largest city, with a slightly higher population than Lethbridge.

<text>RADARSAT-1 was Canada&#x27;s first commercial Earth observation satellite. It utilized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to obtain images of the Earth&#x27;s surface to manage natural resources and monitor global climate change. As of March 2013, the satellite was declared non-operational and is no longer collecting data.

== Mission ==
RADARSAT-1 was launched at 14:22 UTC on 4 November 1995, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, into a Sun-synchronous orbit (dawn-dusk) above the Earth with an altitude of and inclination of 98.60°. Developed under the management of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) in co-operation with Canadian provincial governments and the private sector, it provided images of the Earth for both scientific and marketing purposes. RADARSAT-1&#x27;s images were useful in many fields, including agriculture, cartography, hydrology, forestry, oceanography, geology, ice and ocean monitoring, arctic surveillance, and detecting ocean oil slicks.

== History ==
The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) RADARSAT-1 project was conceived in the early 1980s and included discussions with NASA.

NASA provided the Delta II launch vehicle to launch RADARSAT-1 and access to the NASA Deep Space Network (NASA DSN) in exchange for access to its data. Estimates are that the project, excluding launch, cost CA$620 million. The Canadian federal government contributed about CA$500 million, the four participating provinces (Québec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and British Columbia) about CA$57 million, and the private sector about CA$63 million.

RADARSAT International, Inc. (RSI), a Canadian private company, was created in 1989 to process, market and distribute RADARSAT-1 data. (RADARSAT International, Inc. (RSI) was later acquired by MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates.) In 2006, RSI was rebranded MDA Geospatial Services International or MDA GSI.

== Payload ==
RADARSAT-1 used a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor to image the Earth at a single microwave frequency of 5.3 GHz, in the C band (wavelength of 5.6 cm). The SAR support structure was designed and manufactured by Northrop Grumman Astro Aerospace and deployed to in length on orbit. Unlike optical satellites that sense reflected sunlight, SAR systems transmitted microwave energy towards the surface and recorded the reflections. Thus, Radarsat-1 imaged the Earth, day or night, in any atmospheric condition, such as cloud cover, rain, snow, dust or haze.

Each of RADARSAT-1&#x27;s seven beam modes offered a different image resolution. The modes included Fine, which covers an area of () with a resolution of ; Standard, which covered an area of () and had a resolution of ; and ScanSAR wide, which covered a () area with a resolution of . RADARSAT-1 also had the unique ability to direct its beam at different angles.

== Orbit ==
With an orbital period of 100.70 minutes, RADARSAT-1 circled the Earth 14 times a day. The orbit path repeated every 24 days, meaning that the satellite was in exactly the same location and could take the same image (same beam mode and beam position) every 24 days. This was useful for interferometry and detecting changes at that location that took place during the 24 days. Using different beam positions, a location could also be scanned every few days.

RADARSAT-1 was a right-looking satellite, meaning that the microwave beam transmits and receives on the right side of the satellite, relative to its orbital path. As it descends in its orbit from the North Pole, it faces west, and when it ascends from the South Pole, it faces east. Locations could therefore be imaged from opposite sides. Combined with the different beam modes and positions, this provided users with many possible perspectives from which to image a location.

== End of service ==
On 4 November 2010, RADARSAT-1 celebrated its 15-year service anniversary. It outlived its planned five-year lifetime by a wide margin. Radarsat-2 was launched on 14 December 2007 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan

RADARSAT-1 covered the Arctic daily, and most of Canada every 72 hours depending on instrument orientation and mode. It covered the entire Earth every 24 days.

On 29 March 2013, RADARSAT-1 experienced a technical problem. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) assembled a team of engineers, who conducted an extensive investigation. Following numerous attempts to resolve the problem, the CSA, in consultation with its commercial data distributor MDA Geospatial Services Inc. concluded that RADARSAT-1 was no longer operational.

<text>Wallace Fitzgerald Beery (April 1, 1885 – April 15, 1949) was an American film and stage actor. He is best known for his portrayal of Bill in &quot;Min and Bill&quot; (1930) opposite Marie Dressler, as General Director Preysing in &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932), as the pirate Long John Silver in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934), as Pancho Villa in &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; (1934), and his title role in &quot;The Champ&quot; (1931), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Beery appeared in some 250 films during a 36-year career. His contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stipulated in 1932 that he would be paid $1 more than any other contract player at the studio. This made Beery the highest-paid film actor in the world during the early 1930s. He was the brother of actor Noah Beery and uncle of actor Noah Beery Jr.

For his contributions to the film industry, Beery was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

==Early life==

Beery was born the youngest of three boys on April 1, 1885, in Clay County, Missouri, near Smithville. The Beery family left the farm in the 1890s and moved to nearby Kansas City, Missouri, where his father was a police officer. A fourth brother, Charles, was born in 1880 but survived only a day after his birth. There might have been an older sister but information is faint.

Beery attended the Chase School in Kansas City and took piano lessons as well, but showed little love for academic matters. He ran away from home twice, the first time returning after a short time, quitting school and working in the Kansas City train yards as an engine wiper. Beery ran away from home a second time at age 16 and joined the Ringling Brothers Circus as an assistant elephant trainer. He left two years later after being clawed by a leopard.

==Career==

===Early career===
Wallace Beery joined his older brother Noah in New York City in 1904, finding work in comic opera as a baritone, and appeared on Broadway and in summer stock theatre. He was in &quot;The Belle of the West&quot; in 1905. His most notable early role came in 1907 when he starred in &quot;The Yankee Tourist&quot; to good reviews.

===Comedy film star – Essanay Studios===
In 1913, he moved to Chicago to work for Essanay Studios. His first movie was likely a comedy short, &quot;His Athletic Wife&quot; (1913).

Beery was then cast as Sweedie, a Swedish maid character he played in drag in a series of short comedy films from 1914 to 1916. &quot;Sweedie Learns to Swim&quot; (1914) co-starred Ben Turpin. &quot;Sweedie Goes to College&quot; (1915) starred Gloria Swanson, whom Beery married the following year.

Other Beery films (mostly shorts) from this period included &quot;In and Out&quot; (1914), &quot;The Ups and Downs&quot; (1914), &quot;Cheering a Husband&quot; (1914), &quot;Madame Double X&quot; (1914), &quot;Ain&#x27;t It the Truth&quot; (1915), &quot;Two Hearts That Beat as Ten&quot; (1915), and &quot;The Fable of the Roistering Blades&quot; (1915).

&quot;The Slim Princess&quot; (1915), with Francis X. Bushman, was one of his earliest feature-length films. Beery also did &quot;The Broken Pledge&quot; (1915) and &quot;A Dash of Courage&quot; (1916), both with Swanson.

Beery played a German soldier in &quot;The Little American&quot; (1917) with Mary Pickford, directed by Cecil B. De Mille. He did some comedies for Mack Sennett, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s First False Step&quot; (1917) and &quot;Teddy at the Throttle&quot; (1917), but he gradually left that genre and specialized in portrayals of villains prior to becoming a major leading man during the sound era.

===Villainous roles===
In 1917, Beery portrayed Pancho Villa in &quot;Patria&quot; at a time when Villa was still active in Mexico. (Beery reprised the role 17 years later in &quot;Viva Villa!&quot;.)

Beery was a villainous German in &quot;The Unpardonable Sin&quot; (1919) with Blanche Sweet. For Paramount, he did &quot;The Love Burglar&quot; (1919) with Wallace Reid; &quot;Victory&quot; (1919), with Jack Holt; &quot;Behind the Door&quot; (1919), as another villainous German; and &quot;The Life Line&quot; (1919) with Holt.

Beery was the villain in five major releases in 1920: &quot;813&quot;; &quot;The Virgin of Stamboul&quot; for director Tod Browning; &quot;The Mollycoddle&quot; with Douglas Fairbanks, in which Fairbanks and Beery fist fought as they tumbled down a steep mountain; and in the noncomedic Western &quot;The Round-Up&quot; starring Roscoe Arbuckle as an obese cowboy in a well-received serious film with the tagline &quot;Nobody loves a fat man.&quot; Beery continued his villainy cycle that year with &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, playing Magua.

Beery had a supporting part in &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1920) with Rudolph Valentino. He was a villainous Tong leader in &quot;A Tale of Two Worlds&quot; (1921) and was the bad guy again in &quot;Sleeping Acres&quot; (1922), &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (1922), and &quot;I Am the Law&quot; (1922), which also featured his brother Noah Beery Sr.

===Historical films===

Beery had a large then-rare heroic part as King Richard I (Richard the Lion-Hearted) in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1922), starring Douglas Fairbanks as Robin Hood. The lavish movie was a huge success and spawned a sequel the following year starring Beery in the title role of &quot;Richard the Lion-Hearted&quot;.

Beery had an important unbilled cameo as &quot;the Ape-Man&quot; in &quot;A Blind Bargain&quot; (1922) starring Lon Chaney (Beery is seen crouching, in full ape-man make-up, in the background of some of the movie&#x27;s posters), and a supporting role in &quot;The Flame of Life&quot; (1923). He played another historical ruler, King Philip IV of Spain, in &quot;The Spanish Dancer&quot; (1923) with Pola Negri.

Beery starred in an action melodrama, &quot;Stormswept&quot; (1923) for FBO Films alongside Noah Beery Sr. The tagline on the movie&#x27;s posters was &quot;Wallace and Noah Beery – The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen.&quot;

Beery played his third royal, the Duc de Tours, in &quot;Ashes of Vengeance&quot; (1923) with Norma Talmadge, then did &quot;Drifting&quot; (1923) with Priscilla Dean for director Browning.

Beery had the title role in &quot;Bavu&quot; (1923), about Bolsheviks and the Russian Revolution. He co-starred with Buster Keaton in the comedy &quot;Three Ages&quot; (1923), the first feature Keaton wrote, produced, directed, and starred in.

Beery was a villain in &quot;The Eternal Struggle&quot; (1923), a Mountie drama, produced by Louis B. Mayer, who eventually became crucial to Beery&#x27;s career. He was reunited with Dean and Browning in &quot;White Tiger&quot; (1923), then played the title role in the aforementioned &quot;Richard the Lion-Hearted&quot; (1923), a sequel to &quot;Robin Hood&quot; based on Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Talisman&quot;; a print of &quot;Richard the Lion-Hearted&quot; is held at the Archives du Film du CNC in Bois d&#x27;Arcy.

Beery was in &quot;The Drums of Jeopardy&quot; (1923) and had a supporting role in &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1924) for director Frank Lloyd. He also appeared in a supporting role for Clarence Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Signal Tower&quot; (1925) starring Virginia Valli and Rockliffe Fellowes.

===Paramount===

Beery signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He had a support role in &quot;Adventure&quot; (1925) directed by Victor Fleming.

At First National, he was given the star role of Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s dinosaur epic &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925), arguably his silent performance most frequently screened in the modern era. Beery was top billed in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Cargo&quot; (1925) for Victor Fleming, and supported in &quot;The Night Club&quot; (1925), &quot;The Pony Express&quot; (1925) for James Cruze, and &quot;The Wanderer&quot; (1925) for Raoul Walsh.

Beery starred in a comedy with Raymond Hatton, &quot;Behind the Front&quot; (1926), and he was a villain in &quot;Volcano!&quot; (1926). He was a bos&#x27;n in &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; (1926) for director James Cruze, with Charles Farrell in the romantic lead.

Beery had the title role in the baseball movie &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; (1927). He was reunited with Hatton in &quot;Fireman, Save My Child&quot; (1927) and &quot;Now We&#x27;re in the Air&quot; (1927). The latter also featured Louise Brooks, who was Beery&#x27;s costar in &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; (1928), directed by William Wellman, which was Paramount&#x27;s first part-talkie movie.

He made a fourth comedy with Hatton, &quot;Wife Savers&quot; (1929), then Beery starred in &quot;Chinatown Nights&quot; (1929) for Wellman, produced by a young David O. Selznick. This film was shot silent with the voices dubbed in by the actors afterward, which worked spectacularly well with Beery&#x27;s resonant voice, although the technique was not used again during the silent era for another full-length feature. Beery then played in &quot;Stairs of Sand&quot; (1929), a Western also starring Jean Arthur, before being fired by Paramount.

===MGM===


Irving Thalberg signed Beery to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) as a character actor. The association began well when Beery played the savage convict Butch, a role originally intended for Lon Chaney (who died that same year), in the highly successful 1930 prison film &quot;The Big House&quot;, directed by George W. Hill; Beery was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Beery&#x27;s second film for MGM was also a huge success: &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1930), an early widescreen picture in which he played Pat Garrett. He supported John Gilbert in &quot;Way for a Sailor&quot; (1930) and Grace Moore in &quot;A Lady&#x27;s Morals&quot; (1930), portraying P. T. Barnum in the latter.

====Stardom====
Beery was well established as a leading man and top-rank character actor. The picture that really made him one of the cinema&#x27;s foremost stars was &quot;Min and Bill&quot; (1930) opposite Marie Dressler and directed by George W. Hill, a sensational success.

Beery made a third film with Hill, &quot;The Secret Six&quot; (1931), a gangster movie with Jean Harlow and Clark Gable in key supporting roles. The picture was popular, but was surpassed at the box office by &quot;The Champ&quot;, which Beery made with Jackie Cooper for director King Vidor. The film, especially written for Beery, was another box-office sensation. Beery shared the Best Actor Oscar with Fredric March. Though March received one vote more than Beery, Academy rules at the time—since rescinded—defined results within one vote of each other as &quot;ties.&quot; (An alternate account has MGM head Louis B. Mayer storming backstage at the Oscars and demanding that March and Beery share that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Actor since the vote was so close.)

Beery&#x27;s career went from strength to strength. &quot;Hell Divers&quot; (1932), a naval airplane epic also starring a young Clark Gable billed under Beery, was a big hit. So, too, was the all-star &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932), in which Beery was billed fourth, under Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, and Joan Crawford, one of the very few times he would not be top billed for the rest of his career. In 1932, his contract with MGM stipulated that he be paid a dollar more than any other contract player at the studio, making him the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor.

Beery was a German wrestler in &quot;Flesh&quot; (1932), a hit directed by John Ford, but Ford removed his directorial credit before the film opened, so the picture screened with no director listed despite being labeled &quot;A John Ford Production&quot; in the opening title card. Next Beery was in another all-star ensemble blockbuster, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933), with Jean Harlow holding her own as Beery&#x27;s comically bickering wife. This time, Beery was billed third, under Marie Dressler and John Barrymore.

Beery was lent to the new 20th Century Pictures for the boisterously fast-paced comedy/drama &quot;The Bowery&quot; (1933), also starring George Raft, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray, and featuring Pert Kelton, under the direction of Raoul Walsh. The picture was a smash hit.

Back at MGM, he played the title role of Pancho Villa in &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; (1933) and was reunited with Dressler in &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; (1933), a massive hit. He was Long John Silver in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934), described as a box-office &quot;disappointment&quot; despite being MGM&#x27;s third-largest hit of the season, and remains currently viewed as featuring one of Beery&#x27;s iconic performances.

Beery returned to 20th Century Productions for &quot;The Mighty Barnum&quot; (1934), in which he played P. T. Barnum again. Back at MGM, he was a kindly sergeant in &quot;West Point of the Air&quot; (1935) and was in an all-star spectacular, &quot;China Seas&quot; (1935), this time billed beneath Clark Gable.

&quot;O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1935) reunited Beery and Jackie Cooper. He had the lead as the drunken uncle in MGM&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; (1936) and went back to 20th Century – now 20th Century Fox – for &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; (1936) with Barbara Stanwyck.

At MGM, he was in &quot;Old Hutch&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Good Old Soak&quot; (1937), then he was back at Fox for &quot;Slave Ship&quot; (1937), taking second billing under Warner Baxter, a rarity for Beery after &quot;Min and Bill&quot; catapulted his career into the stratosphere in 1931, during which he received top billing in all but six films (&quot;Min and Bill&quot;, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, &quot;China Seas&quot; with Gable and Harlow, and &quot;Slave Ship&quot;).

====Decline====
The status of Beery&#x27;s films went into a decline. After an abrupt European vacation, Beery was in &quot;The Bad Man of Brimstone&quot; (1938) with Dennis O&#x27;Keefe (and Noah Beery Sr. in a cameo role as a bartender), &quot;Port of Seven Seas&quot; (1938) with Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, &quot;Stablemates&quot; (1938) with Mickey Rooney, &quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; (1939) with Robert Taylor, &quot;Sergeant Madden&quot; (1939) with Tom Brown, &quot;Thunder Afloat&quot; (1939) with Chester Morris, &quot;The Man from Dakota&quot; (1940) with Dolores del Río, and &quot;20 Mule Team&quot; (1940) with Marjorie Rambeau, Anne Baxter, and Noah Beery Jr., enjoying top billing in all of them.
&quot;Wyoming&quot; (1940) teamed Beery with Marjorie Main. After &quot;The Bad Man&quot; (1941), which also stars Lionel Barrymore and future President of the United States Ronald Reagan, and was the remake of a Walter Huston picture, MGM reunited Beery and Main in &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1941), &quot;The Bugle Sounds&quot; (1941), and &quot;Jackass Mail&quot; (1942).

Beery appeared in a war film, a Technicolor comedy titled &quot;Salute to the Marines&quot; (1943), then was back with Main in &quot;Rationing&quot; (1944). &quot;Barbary Coast Gent&quot; (1944), an extremely broad Western comedy in which Beery played a bombastic con man, teamed him with Binnie Barnes. He did another war film, &quot;This Man&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1945), then made another Western with Main, &quot;Bad Bascomb&quot; (1946), a huge hit, helped primarily by Margaret O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s casting.

&quot;The Mighty McGurk&quot; (1947) put Beery with another child star of the studio, Dean Stockwell. &quot;Alias a Gentleman&quot; (1947) was the first of Beery&#x27;s films to lose money during the sound era. Beery received top billing for the hit &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1949), a popular musical featuring Elizabeth Taylor. Beery&#x27;s last film, again featuring Main, &quot;Big Jack&quot; (1949), also lost money according to Mannix&#x27;s reckoning. Beery died of a heart attack three days after the picture&#x27;s release.

=== Working relationship with peers ===

Beery was considered misanthropic and difficult to work with by many of his colleagues. Robert Young described Beery as a &quot;shitty person&quot;. On set, he often never bothered to learn his lines and instead chose to take from other actors&#x27; characters and then resent it when his theft was pointed out. When prompting for another actor&#x27;s close-up, Beery would read the wrong lines, making it harder for his co-stars to meet their marks. Beery was &quot;loathed by everybody, and happily oblivious.&quot;

Mickey Rooney was one of Beery&#x27;s few co-stars to consistently speak highly of him in subsequent decades. In his memoir, Rooney described Beery as &quot;... a lovable, shambling kind of guy who never seemed to know that his shirttail belonged inside his pants, but always knew when a little kid actor needed a smile and a wink or a word of encouragement.&quot; He did concede that &quot;not everyone loved [Beery] as much as I did.&quot; Rooney noted that Howard Strickling, MGM&#x27;s head of publicity, once went to Louis B. Mayer to complain that Beery was stealing props from the studio&#x27;s sets. &quot;And that wasn&#x27;t all&quot;, Rooney continued. &quot;He went on for some minutes about the trouble that Beery was always causing him ... Mayer sighed and said, &#x27;Yes, Howard, Beery&#x27;s a son of a bitch. But he&#x27;s &quot;our&quot; son of a bitch.&#x27; Strickling got the point. A family has to be tolerant of its black sheep, particularly if they brought a lot of money into the family fold, which Beery certainly did.&quot;

Child actors, in particular, recalled unpleasant encounters with Beery. Jackie Cooper, who made several films with him early in his career, called him &quot;a big disappointment.&quot; Cooper accused Beery of upstaging and other attempts to undermine his performances out of what Cooper presumed was jealousy. He recalled impulsively throwing his arms around Beery after one especially heartfelt scene, only to be gruffly pushed away. Child actress Margaret O&#x27;Brien claimed that she had to be protected by crew members from Beery&#x27;s insistence on constantly pinching her.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and children ===
==== First marriage ====
On March 27, 1916, at the age of 30, Beery married 17-year-old actress Gloria Swanson in Los Angeles. The two had co-starred in &quot;Sweedie Goes to College.&quot; Although Beery had enjoyed popularity with his &quot;Sweedie&quot; shorts, his career had taken a dip, and during the marriage to Swanson, he relied on her as a breadwinner. According to Swanson&#x27;s autobiography, Beery raped her on their wedding night, and later tricked her into swallowing an abortifacient when she was pregnant, which caused her to lose their child. Swanson filed for divorce in 1917 and it was finalized in 1918.

==== Second marriage and adoption ====
On August 4, 1924, Beery married actress Rita Gilman &quot;(née&quot; Mary Areta Gilman; 1898–1986) in Los Angeles. The couple adopted Carol Ann Priester (1930–2013), daughter of Rita Beery&#x27;s mother&#x27;s half-sister, Juanita Priester &quot;(née&quot; Caplinger; 1899–1931) and her husband, Erwin William Priester (1897–1969). After years of marriage, Rita filed for divorce on May 1, 1939, in Carson City, Ormsby County, Nevada. Within 20 minutes of filing, she won the decree. Rita remarried 15 days later, on May 16, 1939, to Jessen Albert D. Foyt (1907–1945), filing her marriage license with the same county clerk in Carson City.

==== Second adoption ====
Around December 1939, Beery, recently divorced, adopted a seven-month-old girl, Phyllis Ann Beery. Phyllis appeared in MGM publicity photos when adopted, but was never mentioned again. Beery told the press he had taken the girl in from a single mother, recently divorced, but he had filed no official adoption papers.

==== Paternity suit ====

On February 13, 1948, Gloria Schumm (or Gloria Smith Beery, &quot;née&quot; Florence W. Smith; 1916–1989) filed a paternity suit against Beery. Beery, through his lawyer, Norman Ronald Tyre (1910–2002), initially offered $6,000 as a settlement, but denied being the father. She had given birth on February 7, 1948, to Johan Richard Wallace Schumm. In 1944, Schumm divorced Stuttgart-born Hollywood actor Hans Schumm (&quot;né&quot; Johann Josef Eugen Schumm; 1896–1990), but remarried him August 21, 1947, after realizing that she was pregnant. Prior to remarrying Schumm, she met with Beery at his home, where he gave her the name and address of a physician to submit an examination. At or around that time, she also asked Beery to marry her to &quot;legitimatize the expected child&quot; (her words), which Beery refused.

According to newspapers, Gloria claimed to have been intimate with Wallace Beery on or about May 1, 1947, at his home in Beverly Hills (in the court proceedings, however, she claimed it had occurred on May 17). Beery conceded that he had known Gloria for about 15 years, and that under the pseudonym &quot;Gloria Whitney&quot;, she had played bit roles in six films in which he starred. She again separated from Hans Schumm on April 15, 1948.

=== Alleged fatal altercation ===
In December 1937, comedic actor and Three Stooges founder Ted Healy was involved in a drunken altercation at Cafe Trocadero on the Sunset Strip. E. J. Fleming, in his 2005 book, &quot;The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine&quot;, asserts that Healy was attacked by three men: future James Bond producer Albert &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli, local mob figure Pat DiCicco (who was Broccoli&#x27;s cousin as well as the former husband of Thelma Todd and the future husband of Gloria Vanderbilt), and Wallace Beery. Fleming writes that this beating led to Healy&#x27;s death a few days later.

There is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present. Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fistfight with Healy at the Trocadero. The official autopsy names Healy&#x27;s cause of death as acute toxic nephritis secondary to acute and chronic alcoholism.

=== Hobbies ===
Beery owned and flew his own planes, including a Howard DGA-11. On April 15, 1933, he was commissioned a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy Reserve at NRAB Long Beach. One of his proudest achievements was catching the largest giant black sea bass in the world — — off Santa Catalina Island in 1916, a record that stood for 35 years.

=== Politics and activism ===
In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order creating Jackson Hole National Monument to protect the land adjoining the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. Local ranchers, outraged at the loss of grazing lands, compared FDR&#x27;s action to Hitler&#x27;s taking of Austria. Led by an aging Beery, they protested by herding 500 cattle across the monument lands without a permit.

Beery supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.

=== Death ===
Beery died of a heart attack on April 15, 1949, collapsing while reading a newspaper at his Beverly Hills home. His body was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. The inscription on his grave reads, &quot;No man is indispensable, but some are irreplaceable.&quot;

Beery died intestate. In the paternity suit, Gloria Schumm&#x27;s attorneys demanded $104,135 against Beery&#x27;s $2,220,000 estate. In February 1952, Judge Newcomb Condee approved a $26,750 settlement from the estate. Gloria Schumm accepted the settlement, and Beery&#x27;s paternity of Johan Schumm was not acknowledged.

When Mickey Rooney&#x27;s father died less than a year later, Rooney arranged to have him buried next to his old friend. &quot;I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side,&quot; he wrote.

==Legacy==
For his contributions to the film industry, Wallace Beery posthumously received a motion-picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, located at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard.

Beery is mentioned in the film &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, in which the lead character has been hired to write a wrestling screenplay to star Beery. Another Coen brothers film, &quot;Hail, Caesar!,&quot; features a mockingly named &quot;Wallace Beery Conference Room&quot; scene within a Hollywood studio.

<doc id="142837" wikidata="Q1579747" url="?curid=142837" title="The Big Pond">
<text>The Big Pond is a 1930 American pre-Code romantic comedy film based on a 1928 play of the same name by George Middleton and A. E. Thomas. The film was written by Garrett Fort, Robert Presnell Sr. and Preston Sturges, who provided the dialogue in his first Hollywood assignment, and was directed by Hobart Henley. The film stars Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert, and features George Barbier, Marion Ballou, and Andrée Corday, and was released by Paramount Pictures.

&quot;The Big Pond&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Maurice Chevalier. It also provided Chevalier with his first American hits &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot; by Irving Kahal, Pierre Norman and Sammy Fain and &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Sunlight, Lovin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot; by Al Sherman and Al Lewis.

==Plot==
During a vacation in Venice, Barbara Billings (Claudette Colbert), daughter of a prominent American chewing gum magnate, falls in love with Pierre Mirande (Maurice Chevalier), a French tour guide from a noble family that lost its fortune during World War I. Pierre loves Barbara in return and sings to her that &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot;. Although Barbara&#x27;s mother (Marion Ballou) likes Pierre, her father (George Barbier) and her fiancé Ronnie (Frank Lyon) see him as a fortune-hunting foreigner. In order to get rid of him, Barbara&#x27;s father decides to give him a job doing the hardest work at his factory across the &quot;big pond&quot; in New York City.

Despite doing tough work, Pierre genuinely enjoys his job, impressing his coworker (Nat Pendleton). He also captivates his landlady (Andrée Corday) and her young helper (Elaine Koch) with his Parisian charm and humor. Unfortunately, Pierre becomes exhausted from his work and falls asleep on the night that he is to attend Barbara&#x27;s party. He is then fired when he is wrongly accused of spilling illicit rum on chewing gum samples. However, the incident inspires him to devise a new product for the company – rum-flavored chewing gum. The product is a success. He wins back his job and finds favor with Barbara&#x27;s father, who promotes him.

Although Pierre hopes to use his new position to marry Barbara, he neglects his relationship with her in the process. While he plans to open a new branch of the company in Cleveland and to adopt &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love&quot; as a new sales jingle, a frustrated Barbara declares that she will marry Ronnie instead. However, Pierre whisks her away in a speedboat and the two reconcile and embrace.

==Cast==
*Maurice Chevalier as Pierre Mirande
*Claudette Colbert as Barbara Billings
*George Barbier as Mr. Billings
*Marion Ballou as Mrs. Billings
*Andrée Corday as Toinette
*Frank Lyon as Ronnie
*Nat Pendleton as Pat O&#x27;Day
*Elaine Koch as Jennie

==Songs==
*&quot;Livin&#x27; in the Sunlight, Lovin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot; by Al Sherman and Al Lewis
*&quot;This Is My Lucky Day&quot; by Lew Brown, B. G. DeSylva and Ray Henderson
*&quot;Mia Cara&quot; and &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot; by Irving Kahal, Pierre Norman and Sammy Fain

==Production==
&quot;The Big Pond&quot; and its French language version &quot;La grande mare&quot; were shot simultaneously at the Paramount Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, New York City. Maurice Chevalier, Claudette Colbert, Andrée Corday and Nat Pendelton played the same roles in both versions.

==Awards==
Maurice Chevalier was nominated for a 1930 Academy Award for &quot;Best Actor in a Leading Role&quot; for his performance in &quot;The Big Pond&quot; as well as his performance in &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929).

==French version==
The French language version of &quot;The Big Pond&quot;, which was filmed simultaneously with the English version, was called &quot;La grande mare&quot;. The cast was:

*Maurice Chevalier as &quot;Pierre Mirande&quot;
*Claudette Colbert as &quot;Barbara Billings&quot;
*Henry Mortimer as &quot;Mr. Billings&quot;
*Maude Allen as &quot;Mrs. Billings&quot;
*Andrée Corday as &quot;Toinette&quot;
*William B. Williams as &quot;Ronnie&quot;
*Nat Pendleton as &quot;Pat O&#x27;Day&quot;
*Loraine Jaillet as &quot;Jennie&quot;

Writer Preston Sturges was fluent in French, but additional dialogue was provided by Jacques Bataille-Henri. The technical credits for the two versions are the same, except the editing for the French version was done by Barney Rogan. One critic noted that the French-speaking audience sounded as though they had picked up on risqué lines that must have been edited-out of the English-language version, due to the Production Code. Chevalier said that this lent extra charm to the French-language versions of his films.

<doc id="142839" wikidata="Q479257" url="?curid=142839" title="Stone tool">
<text>Stone tools have been used throughout human history but are most closely associated with prehistoric cultures and in particular those of the Stone Age. Stone tools may be made of either ground stone or knapped stone, the latter fashioned by a craftsman called a flintknapper. Stone has been used to make a wide variety of tools throughout history, including arrowheads, spearheads, hand axes, and querns. Knapped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the tool stone raw material is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.

The study of stone tools is a cornerstone of prehistoric archaeology because they are essentially indestructible and therefore a ubiquitous component of the archaeological record. Ethnoarchaeology is used to further the understanding and cultural implications of stone tool use and manufacture.

Knapped stone tools are made from cryptocrystalline materials such as chert, flint, radiolarite, chalcedony, obsidian, basalt, and quartzite via a splitting process known as lithic reduction. One simple form of reduction is to strike stone flakes from a nucleus (core) of material using a hammerstone or similar hard hammer fabricator. If the goal is to produce flakes, the remnant lithic core may be discarded once too little remains. In some strategies, however, a flintknapper makes a tool from the core by reducing it to a rough unifacial or bifacial preform, which is further reduced by using soft hammer flaking or by pressure flaking the edges. More complex forms of reduction may produce highly standardized blades, which can then be fashioned into a variety of tools such as scrapers, knives, sickles, and microliths.

==Evolution==
Archaeologists classify stone tools into industries (also known as complexes or technocomplexes) that share distinctive technological or morphological characteristics.

In 1969 in the 2nd edition of &quot;World Prehistory&quot;, Grahame Clark proposed an evolutionary progression of flint-knapping in which the &quot;dominant lithic technologies&quot; occurred in a fixed sequence from Mode 1 through Mode 5. He assigned to them relative dates: Modes 1 and 2 to the Lower Palaeolithic, 3 to the Middle Palaeolithic, 4 to the Upper Paleolithic, and 5 to the Mesolithic, though there were other lithic technologies outside these Modes. Each region had its own timeline for the succession of the Modes: for example, Mode 1 was in use in Europe long after it had been replaced by Mode 2 in Africa.

Clark&#x27;s scheme was adopted enthusiastically by the archaeological community. One of its advantages was the simplicity of terminology; for example, the Mode 1 / Mode 2 Transition. The transitions are currently of greatest interest. Consequently, in the literature the stone tools used in the period of the Palaeolithic are divided into four &quot;modes&quot;, each of which designates a different form of complexity, and which in most cases followed a rough chronological order.

===Pre-Mode I===
;Kenya
Stone tools found from 2011 to 2014 at the Lomekwi archeology site near Lake Turkana in Kenya, are dated to be 3.3 million years old, and predate the genus &quot;Homo&quot; by about one million years. The oldest known &quot;Homo&quot; fossil is about 2.4–2.3 million years old compared to the 3.3 million year old stone tools. The stone tools may have been made by &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, the species whose best fossil example is Lucy, which inhabited East Africa at the same time as the date of the oldest stone tools, a yet unidentified species, or by &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot; (a 3.2 to 3.5-million-year-old Pliocene hominin fossil discovered in 1999). Dating of the tools was done by dating volcanic ash layers in which the tools were found and dating the magnetic signature (pointing north or south due to reversal of the magnetic poles) of the rock at the site.

;Ethiopia
Grooved, cut and fractured animal bone fossils, made by using stone tools, were found in Dikika, Ethiopia near (200 yards) the remains of Selam, a young &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; girl who lived about 3.3 million years ago.

===Mode I: The Oldowan Industry===

The earliest stone tools in the era of genus &quot;Homo&quot; are Mode 1 tools, and come from what has been termed the Oldowan Industry, named after the type of site (many sites, actually) found in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, where they were discovered in large quantities. Oldowan tools were characterised by their simple construction, predominantly using core forms. These cores were river pebbles, or rocks similar to them, that had been struck by a spherical hammerstone to cause conchoidal fractures removing flakes from one surface, creating an edge and often a sharp tip. The blunt end is the proximal surface; the sharp, the distal. Oldowan is a percussion technology. Grasping the proximal surface, the hominid brought the distal surface down hard on an object he wished to detach or shatter, such as a bone or tuber. Experiments with modern humans found that all four Oldowan knapping techniques can be invented by knapping-naive participants, and that the resulting Oldowan tools were used by the experiment participants to access a money-baited box.

The earliest known Oldowan tools yet found date from 2.6 million years ago, during the Lower Palaeolithic period, and have been uncovered at Gona in Ethiopia. After this date, the Oldowan Industry subsequently spread throughout much of Africa, although archaeologists are currently unsure which Hominan species first developed them, with some speculating that it was &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot;, and others believing that it was in fact &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. &quot;Homo habilis&quot; was the hominin who used the tools for most of the Oldowan in Africa, but at about 1.9-1.8 million years ago &quot;Homo erectus&quot; inherited them. The Industry flourished in southern and eastern Africa between 2.6 and 1.7 million years ago, but was also spread out of Africa and into Eurasia by travelling bands of &quot;H. erectus&quot;, who took it as far east as Java by 1.8 million years ago and Northern China by 1.6 million years ago.

===Mode II: The Acheulean Industry===

Eventually, more complex Mode 2 tools began to be developed through the Acheulean Industry, named after the site of Saint-Acheul in France. The Acheulean was characterised not by the core, but by the biface, the most notable form of which was the hand axe. The Acheulean first appears in the archaeological record as early as 1.7 million years ago in the West Turkana area of Kenya and contemporaneously in southern Africa.

The Leakeys, excavators at Olduvai, defined a &quot;Developed Oldowan&quot; Period in which they believed they saw evidence of an overlap in Oldowan and Acheulean. In their species-specific view of the two industries, Oldowan equated to &quot;H. habilis&quot; and Acheulean to &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Developed Oldowan was assigned to &quot;habilis&quot; and Acheulean to &quot;erectus&quot;. Subsequent dates on &quot;H. erectus&quot; pushed the fossils back to well before Acheulean tools; that is, &quot;H. erectus&quot; must have initially used Mode 1. There was no reason to think, therefore, that Developed Oldowan had to be &quot;habilis&quot;; it could have been &quot;erectus&quot;. Opponents of the view divide Developed Oldowan between Oldowan and Acheulean. There is no question, however, that &quot;habilis&quot; and &quot;erectus&quot; coexisted, as &quot;habilis&quot; fossils are found as late as 1.4 million years ago. Meanwhile, African &quot;H. erectus&quot; developed Mode 2. In any case a wave of Mode 2 then spread across Eurasia, resulting in use of both there. &quot;H. erectus&quot; may not have been the only hominin to leave Africa; European fossils are sometimes associated with &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;, a contemporary of &quot;H. erectus&quot; in Africa.

In contrast to an Oldowan tool, which is the result of a fortuitous and probably unplanned operation to obtain one sharp edge on a stone, an Acheulean tool is a planned result of a manufacturing process. The manufacturer begins with a blank, either a larger stone or a slab knocked off a larger rock. From this blank he or she removes large flakes, to be used as cores. Standing a core on edge on an anvil stone, he or she hits the exposed edge with centripetal blows of a hard hammer to roughly shape the implement. Then the piece must be worked over again, or retouched, with a soft hammer of wood or bone to produce a tool finely knapped all over consisting of two convex surfaces intersecting in a sharp edge. Such a tool is used for slicing; concussion would destroy the edge and cut the hand.

Some Mode 2 tools are disk-shaped, others ovoid, others leaf-shaped and pointed, and others elongated and pointed at the distal end, with a blunt surface at the proximal end, obviously used for drilling. Mode 2 tools are used for butchering; not being composite (having no haft) they are not very effective killing instruments. The killing must have been done some other way. Mode 2 tools are larger than Oldowan. The blank was ported to serve as an ongoing source of flakes until it was finally retouched as a finished tool itself. Edges were often sharpened by further retouching.

===Mode III: The Mousterian Industry===

Eventually, the Acheulean in Europe was replaced by a lithic technology known as the Mousterian Industry, which was named after the site of Le Moustier in France, where examples were first uncovered in the 1860s. Evolving from the Acheulean, it adopted the Levallois technique to produce smaller and sharper knife-like tools as well as scrapers. Also known as the &quot;prepared core technique&quot;, flakes are struck from worked cores and then subsequently retouched. The Mousterian Industry was developed and used primarily by the Neanderthals, a native European and Middle Eastern hominin species, but a broadly similar industry is contemporaneously widespread in Africa.
===Mode IV: The Aurignacian Industry===
The widespread use of long blades (rather than flakes) of the Upper Palaeolithic Mode 4 industries appeared during the Upper Palaeolithic between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, although blades were produced in small quantities much earlier by Neanderthals. The Aurignacian culture seems to have been the first to rely largely on blades. The use of blades exponentially increases the efficiency of core usage compared to the Levallois flake technique, which had a similar advantage over Acheulean technology which was worked from cores.

====Expansion to the New World====

As humans spread to the Americas in the Late Pleistocene, Paleo-Indians brought with them related stone tools, which evolved separately from Old World technologies. The Clovis point is the most widespread example of Late Pleistocene points in the Americas, dating to about 13,000 years ago.

===Mode V: The Microlithic Industries===

Mode 5 stone tools involve the production of microliths, which were used in composite tools, mainly fastened to a shaft. Examples include the Magdalenian culture. Such a technology makes much more efficient use of available materials like flint, although required greater skill in manufacturing the small flakes. Mounting sharp flint edges in a wood or bone handle is the key innovation in microliths, essentially because the handle gives the user protection against the flint and also improves leverage of the device.

===Neolithic industries===


In prehistoric Japan, ground stone tools appear during the Japanese Paleolithic period, that lasted from around 40,000 BC to 14,000 BC. Elsewhere, ground stone tools became important during the Neolithic period beginning about 10,000 BC. These ground or polished implements are manufactured from larger-grained materials such as basalt, jade and jadeite, greenstone and some forms of rhyolite which are not suitable for flaking. The greenstone industry was important in the English Lake District, and is known as the Langdale axe industry. Ground stone implements included adzes, celts, and axes, which were manufactured using a labour-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against an abrasive stone, often using water as a lubricant. Because of their coarse surfaces, some ground stone tools were used for grinding plant foods and were polished not just by intentional shaping, but also by use. Manos are hand stones used in conjunction with metates for grinding corn or grain. Polishing increased the intrinsic mechanical strength of the axe. Polished stone axes were important for the widespread clearance of woods and forest during the Neolithic period, when crop and livestock farming developed on a large scale. They are distributed very widely and were traded over great distances since the best rock types were often very local. They also became venerated objects, and were frequently buried in long barrows or round barrows with their former owners.

During the Neolithic period, large axes were made from flint nodules by knapping a rough shape, a so-called &quot;rough-out&quot;. Such products were traded across a wide area. The rough-outs were then polished to give the surface a fine finish to create the axe head. Polishing increased the strength and durability of the product. There were many sources of supply, including Grimes Graves in Suffolk, Cissbury in Sussex and Spiennes near Mons in Belgium to mention but a few. In Britain, there were numerous small quarries in downland areas where flint was removed for local use, for example.

Many other rocks were used to make axes from stones, including the Langdale axe industry as well as numerous other sites such as Penmaenmawr and Tievebulliagh in Co Antrim, Ulster. In Langdale, there many outcrops of the greenstone were exploited, and knapped where the stone was extracted. The sites exhibit piles of waste flakes, as well as rejected rough-outs. Polishing improved the mechanical strength of the tools, so increasing their life and effectiveness. Many other tools were developed using the same techniques. Such products were traded across the country and abroad.

==Aboriginal Australian use==

Stone axes from 35,000 years ago are the earliest known use of a stone tool in Australia. Other stone tools varied in type and use among various Aboriginal Australian peoples, dependent on geographical regions and the type and structure of the tools varied among the different cultural and linguistic groups. The locations of the various artefacts, as well as whole geologic features, demarcated territorial and cultural boundaries of various linguistic and cultural groups&#x27; lands. They developed trade networks, and showed sophistication in working many different types of stone for many different uses, including as tools, food utensils and weapons, and modified their stone tools over the millennia to adapt to changing environments. Oral traditions carried the skills down through the ages.

Complex stone tools were used by the Gunditjmara of western Victoria until relatively recently. Many examples are now held in museums.

Flaked stone tools were made by extracting a sharp fragment of stone from a larger piece, called a core, by hitting it with a &quot;hammerstone&quot;. Both the flakes and the hammerstones could be used as tools. The best types of stone for these tools are hard, brittle stones, rich in silica, such as quartzite, chert, flint, silcrete and quartz (the latter particularly in the Kimberleys of Western Australia). These were quarried from bedrock or collected as pebbles from watercourses and beaches, and often carried for long distances. The flake could be used immediately for cutting or scraping, but were sometimes modified in a process called reduction to sharpen or resharpen the flake.

Across northern Australia, especially in Arnhem Land, the &quot;Leilira blade&quot;, a rectangular stone flake shaped by striking quartzite or silcrete stone, was used as a spear tip and also as a knife, sometimes long. Tasmania did not have spears or stone axes, but the peoples there used tools which were adapted to the climate and environment, such as the use of spongolite. In north-western Australia, &quot;Kimberley point&quot;, a small triangular stone point, was created using kangaroo bone which had been shaped with stone into an awl, to make small serrations in the blade.

Apart from being used as weapons and for cutting, grinding (grindstones), piercing and pounding, some stones, notably ochres, were used as pigment for painting.

==Modern uses==
Stone tools are still one of the most successful technologies used by humans.

The invention of the flintlock gun mechanism in the sixteenth century produced a demand for specially shaped gunflints. The gunflint industry survived until the middle of the twentieth century in some places, including in the English town of Brandon.

Threshing boards with lithic flakes are used in agriculture from Neolithic, and are still used today in the regions where agriculture has not been mechanized and industrialized.

Glassy stones (flint, quartz, jasper, agate) were used with a variety of iron pyrite or marcasite stones as percussion fire starter tools. That was the most common method of producing fire in pre-industrial societies. Stones were later superseded by use of steel, ferrocerium and matches.

For specialist purposes glass knives are still made and used today, particularly for cutting thin sections for electron microscopy in a technique known as microtomy. Freshly cut blades are always used since the sharpness of the edge is very great. These knives are made from high-quality manufactured glass, however, not from natural raw materials such as chert or obsidian. Surgical knives made from obsidian are still used in some delicate surgeries, as they cause less damage to tissues than surgical knives and the resulting wounds heal more quickly. In 1975, American archaeologist Don Crabtree manufactured obsidian scalpels which were used for surgery on his own body.

<doc id="142840" wikidata="Q2251736" url="?curid=142840" title="Promethea">
<text>Promethea is a comic book series created by Alan Moore, J. H. Williams III and Mick Gray, published by America&#x27;s Best Comics/WildStorm.

It tells the story of Sophie Bangs, a college student from an alternate futuristic New York City in 1999, who embodies the powerful entity known as Promethea whose task it is to bring the Apocalypse.

Originally published as 32 issues from 1999 to 2005, the series has been re-published into five graphic novels and one hard-back issue. Moore weaves in elements of magic and mysticism along with superhero mythology and action, spirituality and the afterlife (in particular the Tree of Life) and science-fiction. &quot;Promethea&quot; includes wide-ranging experimentation with visual styles and art.

==Plot summary==
In the 5th century AD, a Christian mob threatens the home of a magician in Hellenistic Egypt. He tells his daughter Promethea to flee into the desert, hoping the gods of the ancient world will preserve her. The story shifts to New York City in the late 20th century. Sophie Bangs is hoping to interview a woman named Barbara Shelley for a college paper on &quot;Promethea&quot;, a character who seems to recur in literature and pop culture through the centuries. Shelley is hostile to her and warns: &quot;You don&#x27;t wanna go looking for folklore. And you especially don&#x27;t want folklore to come looking for you&quot;. After departing, Sophie is tracked and attacked by a creature known as a Smee. Just as things look bleakest for Sophie, she is rescued by Barbara, who has mystical powers and is now dressed as Promethea. She informs Sophie that the only reason she would be attacked is if someone suspects she will become the next vessel for Promethea (Barbara is the current). It turns out that Promethea is called to the world when someone uses their imagination to make her real. As they hide from the pursuing Smee, the weakened and fatally injured Barbara instructs Sophie to write a poem about Promethea hoping Sophie is indeed the successor and the creative expression is a way to get Sophie in the correct state of mind to allow herself to become Promethea. Barbara&#x27;s idea works and from that night Sophie, having defeated the Smee, becomes the next Promethea.

The story continues with Sophie/Promethea learning about Promethea and the previous individuals who have in the past been the vessels for Promethea. In the days that follow, the hospital where Barbara lies is attacked by demons, an act that leads to Barbara&#x27;s death. This motivates Sophie to learn more about magic, mysticism and the Tree of Life and its spheres in order to find Barbara and help her seek Steve Shelly, Barbara&#x27;s dead husband. Throughout their climb up the spheres of Tree of Life Sophie/Promethea and Barbara encounter difficulties such as imprisonment by the demon Asmodeus, as well as meeting figures such as Sophie&#x27;s father Juan (who died when she was little), Barbara&#x27;s guardian angel Boo-Boo and Promethea&#x27;s father, who she has not seen since his murder in 411 A.D. Eventually Barbara and Steve find each other and are re-incarnated as twins (who Sophie ends up looking after at the end of the book). Having been gone a whole summer, Sophie is unaware the FBI has been tracking Promethea, and want to take her into custody for the events Promethea has caused throughout the years. Moments before the FBI arrives, Sophie&#x27;s mother instructs her to run away (just as Promethea&#x27;s father had centuries earlier).

Three years pass and Sophie, having abandoned her duties as Promethea, hides in Millennium City under the alias Joey Estrada with new boyfriend Carl. However, after being found by the FBI and Tom Strong, Sophie reluctantly becomes Promethea and in turn carries out one final task; bringing about the end of the world.

==References, criticisms, and developments==
The series is, by Moore&#x27;s own admission, didactic: &quot;There are 1000 comic books on the shelves that don&#x27;t contain a philosophy lecture and one that does. Isn&#x27;t there room for that one?&quot; As suggested by the title &quot;Promethea&quot;, which implies the feminine version of the mythological Prometheus, the title also participates in the subgenre of feminism in superhero comics. In making his lead character an aspiring poet whose words conjure the malleable form of a literary goddess—as well as the non-linear narratives and references to literary theory and alternative philosophies—Moore&#x27;s thematics are closely aligned with the countercultural theory and politics of &quot;écriture féminine&quot;.

Subjects dealt with in this series include the occult, the tarot and Hermetic Qabalah. The comic is laden with mythological mystical symbolism, drawing in many religious and cultural references. Real people who appear in Promethea include Aleister Crowley, John Dee, Austin Osman Spare, and John Kendrick Bangs (who in the comic is distantly related to Sophie Bangs).

In January 2018, DC Comics, the owner of the America&#x27;s Best Comics / WildStorm imprint, introduced Promethea into its mainstream continuity by way of the comic &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #24. The controversial storyline involved Promethea assisting various superheroes in fighting a villain called the Queen of Fables. Artist J. H. Williams III was reported as having no prior knowledge of the introduction of the character into DC Comics&#x27; broader continuity, and is quoted as saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t in good conscience condone this happening in any form at all&quot;.

==Main characters==
===Promethea===
Promethea is a young girl whose father is killed by a Christian mob in Alexandria in 411 AD. After escaping the mob, alone in the desert she is taken in hand by the god Thoth-Hermes, who tells her that if she goes with him/them into the Immateria, a plane of existence home to the imagination, she will no longer be just a little girl but a story living eternally. &quot;Promethea&quot; thereafter manifests through a series of individuals or vessels who have channeled her energy through the power of imagination.

Since the incident with the little girl in Alexandria, there have been eight known Promethea vessels. Six are characters in the story, the other two are told as two individuals, one Christian and one Muslim, who live during the Crusades and fight each other. As there should only ever be one active Promethea at any one moment in history, the fight causes Promethea great pain, something that is repeated when Stacia/Grace fights Sophie/Promethea. It could be argued that there is a ninth Promethea vessel – Stacia Vanderveer. However, Stacia is only a vessel for Grace Brannagh, a dead woman who once herself was Promethea and not the original little girl.

===Sophie Bangs/Joey Estrada===
The protagonist of the series, Sophie becomes Promethea after tracing the character&#x27;s history in literature for a college paper. Her personality as Sophie is initially somewhat timid; by the end of the book she becomes an adept magician and confident young woman. She is the most powerful Promethea to date, and the only one not to have been killed during her time as Promethea. She changes her name to Joey after running away to Millennium City to escape the FBI and her duties as Promethea.

===Barbara Shelley/Boo-Boo Ramirez===
The wife of comic book writer Steven Shelley, Barbara became Promethea when her husband began projecting Barbara&#x27;s characteristics onto the Promethea character in his comics. During her passage in the afterlife, Barbara meets her guardian angel Boo-Boo (Barbara&#x27;s old nickname) who is in fact the younger, beautiful and independent young woman she used to be. By the time she finds her husband, she and Boo-Boo become one person.

===Stacia Vanderveer===
Sophie&#x27;s best friend, Stacia is an extremely cynical and sarcastic college student. During an attack at the hospital she was visiting Sophie in, Sophie uses Stacia as a vessel for Grace Brannagh to help the fight. While Sophie journeyed to find Barbara in the afterlife, Stacia/Grace were re-instated to temporarily serve as acting Promethea, leading Stacia and Grace to fall in love. After Sophie&#x27;s return, Stacia and Grace refused to relinquish the Promethea title, but were forced to by a court hearing in the Immateria. After the Apocalypse, Stacia and former FBI Agent Ball become lovers, while Stacia still has sexual liaisons with Grace in the Immateria.

===Grace Brannagh===
An illustrator who created a series of covers for pulp magazine fantasy stories about Promethea, which were written by several writers under the pseudonym &quot;Marto Neptura&quot;. Brannagh was the most proficient fighter of all the Prometheas. She held the Promethea mantle from 1920 to 1939. In a text article in &quot;Promethea&quot; #1, Brannagh&#x27;s style is compared to that of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; illustrator Margaret Brundage.

===Jack Faust===
Jack Faust is a magician who first approaches Sophie in order to confuse her during her first days as Promethea. Jack is first seen as a handsome young man, but is actually revealed to be older, balding and overweight. Jack promises to teach Sophie magic if she (in her Promethea form) agrees to have sex with him. At first Sophie declines, but later agrees, knowing this knowledge will help her travel in the afterlife and help Barbara.

==Recurring characters==
===William &quot;Bill&quot; Woolcott===
The only man to assume the role of Promethea, Bill Woolcott was a gay comic artist who became Promethea by drawing her. He was the longest-lasting Promethea, from 1939 to 1969, and acted as a &quot;science-hero&quot; in the ABC universe with Tom Strong during that period. Bill/Promethea most resembles a 1960s version of Wonder Woman. Bill was shot in the head by Promethea&#x27;s lover, FBI Agent Dennis Drucker, who reacted violently when he discovered that his lover was (in a manner of speaking) transgender. Drucker spent several decades in an insane asylum tortured by guilt for having killed Promethea, while Bill/Promethea spent similar time in the Immateria blaming herself for not having told him the truth. The two are reunited during the Apocalypse.

===Anna===
The poet Charlton Sennet, in the 1770s, projected Promethea&#x27;s likeness onto his housemaid Anna, transforming her into his dream lover. This Promethea bore him a child, but the baby evaporated on birth, since in a sense it was only &quot;half-real&quot;, an amalgamation of the physical nature of Charlton Sennet and the metaphysical nature of Promethea. Anna died in childbirth, leaving Charlton alone (his wife deserted him after finding him in bed with Anna/Promethea).

===Margaret Taylor Case===
The writer of a William Randolph Hearst-syndicated comic strip titled &quot;Little Margie in Misty Magic Land&quot;, Case wrote Promethea into her comic book as a helpful spirit to the titular young adventurer, and ended up personifying Promethea to help soldiers on the battlefield from 1900 to 1920, in a manner similar to the legendary Angels of Mons. Little Margie also dwells in the Immateria alongside Case and the other past Prometheas, where she is regarded as little more than a pest who interrupts &quot;serious&quot; conversation with her childlike observations, styled after the remarks of the character Nemo in the early 20th-century newspaper strip &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;. Margaret committed suicide during her tenure as Promethea.

===Five Swell Guys===

The Five Swell Guys are a team of &quot;science-heroes&quot;, and the only such team in New York City. There is similarity between them and The Fantastic Four, with their floating platform and their specialized members. The team meet Sophie Bangs in the first issue, and then meet Promethea in the third issue, after one is badly hurt.

===Weeping Gorilla Comix===

The &quot;Weeping Gorilla Comix&quot; is a series of one-panel comics featuring a weeping gorilla, with a thought bubble pronouncing some thoughtful phrase, usually cynical and self-pitying in nature: &quot;Why do good things happen to bad people?&quot;, &quot;Who remaindered the book of Love?&quot;, &quot;She gets the kids and the house. I get the car&quot;, etc. The whole concept is an industry joke about the supposed tendency for comics to get increased sales from a picture of a gorilla, a weeping character, or the color purple on the cover. Occasionally Moore shows snippets of the gorilla&#x27;s foil, the Chucklin&#x27; Duck, who is happy-go-lucky and naively optimistic, with smug saying such as &quot;Heh heh! I got out of internet trading just in time!&quot;. Both the Weeping Gorilla and Chucklin&#x27; Duck motifs were used in the &quot;Greyshirt: Indigo Sunset&quot; series by Rick Veitch, and a Weeping Gorilla Comix panel makes a cameo appearance in the story &quot;King Solomon Pines&quot; in &quot;Tom Strong&#x27;s Terrific Tales&quot; #5 (scripted by Leah Moore and illustrated by Sergio Aragones). The &quot;Tesla Strong&quot; miniseries included, amongst various versions of Solomon, one who resembled the Weeping Gorilla.

<text>Ronald Charles Colman (9 February 1891 – 19 May 1958) was an English-born actor, starting his career in theatre and silent film in his native country, then emigrating to the United States where he had a highly successful Hollywood film career. He starred in silent films and successfully transitioned to sound, aided by a distinctive, pleasing voice. He was most popular during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. He received Oscar nominations for &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1929), &quot;Condemned&quot; (1929) and &quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1942). Colman starred in several classic films, including &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1935), &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937). He also played the starring role in the Technicolor classic &quot;Kismet&quot; (1944), with Marlene Dietrich, which was nominated for four Academy Awards. In 1947, he won an Academy Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for the film &quot;A Double Life&quot;.

Colman was an inaugural recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in motion pictures. He was awarded a second star for his television work.

==Early years==
Ronald Charles Colman was born in Richmond, Surrey, England, the third son (his eldest brother died in infancy in 1882) and fifth child of Charles Colman, a silk merchant and mantle manufacturer, and his wife Marjory Read Fraser. His surviving siblings were Gladys, Edith, Eric and Freda. He was a cousin of the Labour politician Grace Colman.

He attended Hadleigh House School in Littlehampton where he discovered that he enjoyed acting, despite his shyness. Later he was educated at Rolandseck School in Ealing under the German-born headmaster Ernst Felix Marx (1858-1942). He intended to study engineering at Cambridge, but his father&#x27;s sudden death from pneumonia in 1907 made it financially impossible.

==First World War==
While working as a clerk with Watts, Watts &amp; Co., Ltd. (managers of the Britain Steamship Company) in the City of London, Colman joined the London Scottish Regiment in 1909 for four years. At the outbreak of the First World War, he quit his job the next day and rejoined his regiment. He was now Private No. 2148 with the 1/14th (County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment (London Scottish). On the 15 September 1914, the battalion embarked at Southampton in the SS Winifred and arrived the next day at Le Havre. Six weeks later, the London Scottish were driven to Ypres to reinforce the front. At Ypres, Colman was said to have &quot;had the decidedly unpleasant experience of being buried alive by the explosion of a shell&quot;, and was dug out unharmed. Later that day, the battalion was moved to Wytschaete, where it engaged in the Battle of Messines on the next day, the 31 October 1914. Colman was seriously wounded in his ankle, which gave him a limp that he sought to hide throughout his acting career: &quot;Disability. Fracture of Ankle (Rt.) In action near Ypres 31-10-14. Man states that when advancing a shell burst near him, and he was thrown heavily injuring his right foot either by the fall or his foot being struck. There is considerable thickening of Rt. ankle. There is also some tenderness and after walking any distance there is pain and lameness.&quot; He was treated at the field ambulance and was transferred to England the next day. Colman was admitted to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London where he stayed from 6 to 11 November 1914. Having sufficiently recovered, he was transferred to the 3/14 battalion of the London Scottish and was sent to Perth, where he did light clerical duty and lived at Strathview (No. 75 - 77), Muirton Place. About half a year later, on 6 May 1915, he was declared &quot;No longer fit physically for war service&quot; and discharged. His military character was given as &quot;Very good. Honest, sober and trustworthy.&quot; Colman was awarded a pension as well as the Victory Medal, the British War Medal, the 1914 Star with clasps and roses and the Silver War Badge. In 1928 he was made an honorary life member of the London Scottish. His fellow Hollywood actors Claude Rains, Herbert Marshall, Cedric Hardwicke, and Basil Rathbone all saw service with the London Scottish in the war.

==Career==
===Concert parties and amateur stage===

 About the same time when he joined the London Scottish, Colman took to the stage and soon established himself as a member of the performing community in Ealing. Between 1909 and 1914, he appeared solo and with various concert parties and amateur dramatics groups. He began with banjo solos at benefit concerts and two years later joined the short-lived Pierrot troupes The Tangerines and The Summer ‘Uns, who only had one performance. In 1912, while on the Isle of Wight, he and some friends formed The Mad Medicos, who performed under his direction. A part of this troupe then became The Popinjays, again under Colman’s direction, until George Denby (c. 1889-1951) took over. Besides banjo solos and duets, Colman’s repertoire included songs and duets like „Two Little Sausages“ (Lionel Monckton) and musical monologues, recitals of poems like &quot;The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God&quot;, funny stories and above all character sketches from Dickens such as Uriah Heep, John Brodie and Martin Chuzzlewit. At „An Evening With Dickens“, he played Charles Darnay in three scenes from &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. He also staged three pieces of his own: the duologues &quot;My Pierrot&quot; and &quot;A Knotty Problem&quot; and the miniature revue &quot;Come Inside&quot;. When Colman rejoined the Popinjays in July 1916 for performances at the Pavilion in Derby, between theatre engagements, there is a marked change in his repertoire: The character sketch is now of a Chelsea Pensioner, and he recites &quot;Spotty, a Tale of the Trenches&quot;.

Besides these performances, Colman also appeared on the amateur stage. He made his debut as Freddy Fitzfoodle in &quot;Rich Miss Rustle&quot; at Victoria Hall, Ealing, on 11 November 1909. In 1910 followed the one-act plays &quot;Barbara&quot; and &quot;Lights Out&quot; and &quot;Spoiling the Broth&quot;. In October and November of the same year, he sang and danced as Bill Bobstay in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; with the West Middlesex Operatic Society. In 1911 he appeared in the farcical comedy &quot;Jane&quot; and in the next year as Samson Quayle in &quot;A Tight Corner&quot;. Around this time Colman joined the Bancroft Dramatic Club, which had been founded in 1892 by Sir Squire Bancroft and performed mainly at the King’s Hall Theatre on the premises of the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden. Among its vice presidents were actors like George Alexander, Johnston Forbes-Robertson and Ellen Terry. With the Bancroft D. C., Colman appeared in six plays between 1911 and 1914: &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;, &quot;Priscilla Runs Away&quot;, &quot;The Dancing Girl&quot;, &quot;The Passing of the Third Floor Back&quot;, &quot;Fanny’s First Play&quot;, and &quot;Sowing the Wind&quot;. He also performed in &quot;Mr. Steinman’s Corner&quot; and as Douglas Cattermole in &quot;The Private Secretary&quot; with Vivian Parrott’s Amateur Dramatic Society.

===Theatre===

Colman had sufficiently recovered from his wartime injuries to appear at the London Coliseum on 19 June 1916 as Rahmat Sheikh in &quot;The Maharani of Arakan&quot;, with Lena Ashwell, at the Playhouse in December that year as Stephen Weatherbee in the Charles Goddard/Paul Dickey play &quot;The Misleading Lady&quot;, and at the Court Theatre in March 1917 as Webber in &quot;Partnership&quot;. At the same theatre, the following year he appeared in Eugène Brieux&#x27;s &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;. At the Ambassadors Theatre in February 1918, he played George Lubin in &quot;The Little Brother&quot;. In 1918, he toured the UK as David Goldsmith in &quot;The Bubble&quot; and as Wilfred Carpenter in &quot;The Live Wire&quot;.

In 1920, Colman went to America and toured with Robert Warwick in &quot;The Dauntless Three&quot; and subsequently toured with Fay Bainter in &quot;East Is West&quot;. He married his first wife, Thelma Raye, in 1920; they divorced in 1934. At the Booth Theatre in New York City in January 1921, he played the Temple Priest in William Archer&#x27;s play &quot;The Green Goddess&quot;. With George Arliss at the 39th Street Theatre in August 1921, he appeared as Charles in &quot;The Nightcap&quot;. In September 1922, he had great success as Alain Sergyll at the Empire Theatre in New York City in &quot;La Tendresse&quot;, which was to be his final stage work.

===Film===

Colman had first appeared in films in Britain in 1917 and 1919 for director Cecil Hepworth. He subsequently acted for the old Broadwest Film Company in &quot;Snow in the Desert&quot;. While he was on stage in New York City in &quot;La Tendresse&quot;, director Henry King saw him and engaged him as the leading man in the 1923 film &quot;The White Sister&quot;, opposite Lillian Gish. He was an immediate success. Thereafter, Colman virtually abandoned the stage for film. 

He became a very popular silent film star in both romantic and adventure films, among them &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; (1925), &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1926), &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Winning of Barbara Worth&quot; (1926). His dark hair and eyes and his athletic and riding ability (he did most of his own stunts until late in his career) led reviewers to describe him as a &quot;Valentino type&quot;. He was often cast in similar, exotic roles. Towards the end of the silent era, Colman was teamed with Hungarian actress Vilma Bánky under Samuel Goldwyn; the two were a popular film team, rivalling Greta Garbo and John Gilbert.

Although he was a huge success in silent films, he was unable to capitalise on one of his chief assets until the advent of the talking picture – &quot;his beautifully modulated and cultured voice&quot; also described as &quot;a bewitching, finely modulated, resonant voice&quot;. Colman was often viewed as a suave English gentleman, whose voice embodied chivalry and mirrored the image of a &quot;stereotypical English gentleman&quot;. Commenting on Colman&#x27;s appeal, English film critic David Shipman stated that Colman was &quot;the dream lover – calm, dignified, trustworthy. Although he was a lithe figure in adventure stories, his glamour – which was genuine – came from his respectability; he was an aristocratic figure, without being aloof.&quot;

His first major talkie success was in 1930, when he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for two roles – &quot;Condemned&quot; and &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot;. He thereafter appeared in a number of notable films: &quot;Raffles&quot; in 1930, &quot;Clive of India&quot; and &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in 1935, &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; in 1936, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; and &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; in 1937, &quot;If I Were King&quot; in 1938, and &quot;Random Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; in 1942. He won the Best Actor Oscar in 1948 for &quot;A Double Life&quot;. He next starred in a screwball comedy, 1950&#x27;s &quot;Champagne for Caesar&quot;.

At the time of his death, Colman was contracted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the lead role in &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;. After Colman&#x27;s death, however, the film transferred production from MGM Studios in Culver City, California to MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, England. George Sanders, who married Colman&#x27;s widow, Benita Hume, was cast in the role intended for Colman.

===Fame===
Colman has been mentioned in many novels, but he is specifically mentioned in Ralph Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Man&quot; because of his charming, well-known voice. The main character of this novel says that he wishes he could have a voice like Colman&#x27;s because it is charming, and relates the voice to that of a gentleman or a man from &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Colman was indeed very well known for his voice. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says that Colman had a &quot;resonant, mellifluous speaking voice with a unique, pleasing timbre&quot;. Along with his charming voice, Colman had a very confident performing manner that helped make him a major star of sound films.

===Radio and television===
As early as 1942, Colman joined forces with several other Hollywood luminaries to inaugurate international broadcasts by the CBS radio network over La Cadena de las Americas (The Network of the Americas) under the supervision of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs chaired by Nelson Rockefeller. In the process, he contributed substantially to the implementation of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives throughout South America during World War II.
Colman&#x27;s vocal talents contributed to National Broadcasting Company programming on D-Day, 6 June 1944. On that day, Colman read &quot;Poem and Prayer for an Invading Army&quot; written by Edna St. Vincent Millay for exclusive radio use by NBC.

Beginning in 1945, Colman made many guest appearances on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; on radio, alongside his second wife, stage and screen actress Benita Hume, whom he married in 1938. Their comedy work as Benny&#x27;s perpetually exasperated next-door neighbors led to their own radio comedy &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; from 1950 to 1952, created by &quot;Fibber McGee &amp; Molly&quot; mastermind Don Quinn, on which the Colmans played the literate, charming president of a middle American college and his former-actress wife. Listeners were surprised to discover that the episode of 24 January 1951, &quot;The Goya Bequest&quot; – a story examining the bequest of a Goya painting that was suspected of being a fraud hyped by its late owner to avoid paying customs duties when bringing it to the United States – was written by Colman himself, who poked fun at his accomplishment while taking a rare turn giving the evening&#x27;s credits at the show&#x27;s conclusion.

&quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; ran on NBC radio from 1950 to 1952; an adaptation of the same name was on CBS television for the 1954–55 season.

Colman was also the host and occasional star of the syndicated anthology &quot;Favorite Story&quot; (1946–49). Of note was his narration and portrayal of Scrooge in a 1948 adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==Death==
In 1957, Colman had surgery for a lung infection, and suffered from ill health afterwards. He was hospitalized and died on 19 May 1958, aged 67, from acute emphysema in Santa Barbara, California, and was interred in the Santa Barbara Cemetery. He had a daughter, Juliet Benita (born 1944), with his second wife, Benita Hume.

==Awards, honours and legacy==
Colman was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Actor. At the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony he received a single nomination for his work in two films; &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1929) and &quot;Condemned&quot; (1929). He was nominated again for &quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1942), before winning for &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), in which he played the role of Anthony John, an actor playing Othello who comes to identify with the character. He also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in 1947 for &quot;A Double Life&quot;. In 2002, Colman&#x27;s Oscar statuette was sold at auction by Christie&#x27;s for US$174,500.

Colman was a recipient of the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

Colman has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, one for motion pictures at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard and one for television at 1623 Vine Street.

He is the subject of a biography written by his daughter Juliet Benita Colman in 1975: &quot;Ronald Colman: A Very Private Person&quot;.

The Dublin slang term &quot;ronnie&quot;, referring to a moustache, derives from Colman&#x27;s thin moustache.

==Writing==
When asked what his choice would be if he had to take up another profession, Colman answered: Writing. As a young entertainer, he had written three short pieces for the stage (see above) and also several articles that were published in magazines. In 1922, when he was looking for work in New York, he wrote a script called „The Amazing Experiment“. After his arrival in Hollywood, Samuel Goldwyn asked him to contribute a number of autobiographical pieces for the publicity department. Later, in 1951, he wrote two episodes for the radio show &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot;, „The Goya Bequest“ and „Halloween“. In the next year, he adapted „The Lost Silk Hat“ with Milton Merlin from a story by Lord Dunsany for the television show „Four Star Playhouse“. However, despite tempting offers, Colman never wrote his memoirs.

<text>Bulldog Drummond is a 1929 American pre-Code crime film in which Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond helps a beautiful young woman in distress. The film stars Ronald Colman as the title character, Claud Allister, Lawrence Grant, Montagu Love, Wilson Benge, Joan Bennett, and Lilyan Tashman. Produced by Samuel Goldwyn and directed by F. Richard Jones, the movie was adapted by Sidney Howard from the play by H. C. McNeile (credited onscreen as &quot;Sapper&quot;).

Colman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and William Cameron Menzies for Best Art Direction.

Two previous Bulldog Drummond films had been produced: &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1923) and &quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Third Round&quot; (1925). The 1929 film was the first Bulldog Drummond movie with sound, and was also Ronald Colman&#x27;s first talkie. A series of Drummond movies followed, beginning with &quot;Temple Tower&quot; made in the UK in 1930; see the main article on Bulldog Drummond for a complete list.
==Plot==
Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond, a demobilised British captain bored with civilian life, places a personal advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; offering his services for &quot;any excitement&quot;. One of the many replies intrigues him: Phyllis Benton claims she is in great danger. He immediately sets out for the Green Bay Inn, where she has reserved some rooms for him. Unable to persuade him to give up this mad adventure, his friend Algy Longworth follows after, dragging Drummond&#x27;s valet, Danny, along.

Phyllis turns out to be all Drummond had hoped for: beautiful and desperately in need of help. Her wealthy uncle, John Travers, is being treated in a hospital by a Dr. Lakington for a nervous breakdown, but she is sure there is something wrong about the hospital and Dr. Lakington, and that she is being watched constantly. She runs away when she spots the outline of two eavesdropping men (Algy and Danny), much to Drummond&#x27;s annoyance. She is caught and taken to Dr. Lakington&#x27;s Nursing Home by Carl Peterson, Irma and the doctor.

When Drummond follows, he witnesses Travers&#x27; unsuccessful attempt to escape. Drummond drives away, but returns stealthily and rescues Phyllis. Sending her off with Algy and Danny, he sneaks back once more and overhears Irma convince the others to stay and try to get Travers&#x27; signature on a document transferring securities and jewels to them. Drummond manages to save Travers.

However, he makes a serious error when he takes Travers back to the inn. The villains soon arrive there. Drummond manages to disguise himself as Travers; the crooks take him back, along with Phyllis. When they realise they have the wrong man they threaten to torture Phyllis. Drummond tells them Travers is hidden at the inn (whereas he is really being driven to London). While Peterson and Irma go to check, Drummond is freed by Phyllis before Lakington can kill him. He strangles the doctor. Drummond disarms Peterson when he returns, but his gang pose as policemen and take him away. Phyllis persuades Drummond to let them go, telling him she loves him.

==Critical reaction==

Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;the happiest and most enjoyable entertainment of its kind that has so far reached the screen&quot;, and recommended it to those who had harsh words for the burgeoning phenomenon of motion pictures with sound. Hall lauded the film for going beyond a mere filmed version of the stage show, and the &quot;artistry&quot; with which director F. Richard Jones fashioned his scenes with an eye toward humor and thrills. Hall also praised the technical achievement of the sound quality, and the performances of Ronald Colman, Montagu Love and Lilyan Tashman.

<text>Lawrence Mervil Tibbett (November 16, 1896 – July 15, 1960) was an American opera singer and recording artist who also performed as a film actor and radio personality. A baritone with large, deep, and dark-timbred voice. His dynamic range (in his prime) ranged from forceful fortes to delicate pianissimos, he sang leading roles with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City more than 600 times from 1923 to 1950. He performed diverse musical theatre roles, including Captain Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in a touring show.

==Biography==
Lawrence Tibbett was born Lawrence Mervil Tibbet (with a single final &quot;t&quot;) on November 16, 1896, in Bakersfield, California. His father was a part-time deputy sheriff, killed in a shootout with outlaw Jim McKinney in 1903. Tibbett grew up in Los Angeles, earning money by singing in church choirs and at funerals. He graduated from Manual Arts High School in 1915. A year later, he met his future wife, Grace Mackay Smith, who rented a room in his mother&#x27;s house. During World War I, he served in the Merchant Marine, after which he found employment singing as prologue to silent movies at the Grauman &quot;Million Dollar&quot; Theater in downtown Los Angeles.

Tibbett studied in New York City with Frank La Forge and in 1923 at the age of 26, he signed his first contract, for $60 per week, with the Metropolitan Opera, using the name &quot;Tibbett&quot;. The Met mistakenly added the extra &quot;t&quot; to his last name on his contract and he decided to keep the new spelling. Over the ensuing years, with the Met, he built a hugely successful career, displaying an outstanding voice, immaculate musicianship, and a strong stage presence.

His Met roles included Valentin in Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, Silvio, and later, Tonio, in Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; and the King&#x27;s Herald in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. He first achieved national recognition playing Ford in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. Tibbett traveled to California in 1927 to sing the lead role in the Grove Play &quot;St. Francis of Assisi&quot;, and it was during that trip to San Francisco when he met ex-New Yorker Jennie Marston Burgard (daughter of New York banker Edgar L. Marston), whom he married in 1932. During the 1930s, Tibbett toured Europe and Australia, performing on stage or giving recitals in London, Paris, Prague and Vienna as well as in Sydney and Melbourne.
Tibbett made his first recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1926. He recorded exclusively for Victor/RCA Victor for his entire career.
In the early 1930s, Tibbett also appeared in movies, after getting his start at Neely Dickson&#x27;s Hollywood Community Theater. His sojourn in Hollywood proved brief, although he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his first film, &quot;The Rogue Song&quot;, a 1930 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production with Laurel and Hardy, shot in two-color Technicolor (only a few minutes of footage of the film, as well as the complete soundtrack, is known to survive today). Soon after, he starred in another MGM musical film, &quot;New Moon&quot;, opposite Grace Moore and &quot;The Cuban Love Song&quot; (1931), with Lupe Vélez. In 1935, he appeared in &quot;Metropolitan&quot; for 20th Century-Fox. This film is notable for its extensive segments of Tibbett&#x27;s performing operatic arias in a stage setting. He also starred in the film &quot;The Prodigal&quot; in 1931 with Esther Ralston and Roland Young in which he sings &quot;Without a Song.&quot; His final film was &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; in 1936. Also during the 1930s, Tibbett had a domestic radio program sponsored by the Packard Motor Car Company of America on which he sang formal music. The company chose him to announce the Packard 120 to the world on air; he drove one. When the firm wanted to sell less expensive cars, they persuaded him to add popular tunes to his repertoire in order to boost sales. He also appeared on &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;.

In 1936, with violinist Jascha Heifetz, he founded the American Guild of Musical Artists, the most important labor union for solo performing artists. He was the guild&#x27;s proactive president for 17 years. His forceful and articulate advocacy of artistic causes was unique in its day.

In January 1937, during a rehearsal onstage at the Met for Richard Hageman&#x27;s opera &quot;Caponsacchi&quot;, Tibbett accidentally stabbed a long-time member of the chorus, Joseph Sterzini, during a fight scene, causing a small wound in Sterzini&#x27;s hand. Sterzini, who suffered from high blood pressure, died later that day.

After his operatic career concluded, Tibbett performed in musicals and plays in the early 1950s. He spent a summer in stock as the Reverend Davidson in &quot;Rain&quot; and played Captain Hook in a short-lived tour of the John Burrell staging of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; that was mounted for Jean Arthur and featured a musical score by the young Leonard Bernstein. Veronica Lake played Peter. Most notably, Tibbett took over the Italian operatic bass Ezio Pinza&#x27;s role in &quot;Fanny&quot; during its original run on Broadway.

==Later years and death==
In later years Tibbett served as host of a radio show featuring historic recordings of operatic singers. He leavened matters with reminiscences of his own stage experiences. Suffering from severe arthritis and years of heavy drinking, he aged prematurely as his health worsened. He died on July 15, 1960, after hitting his head on a table during a fall in his apartment.
The &quot;Time&quot; obituary said of him:
&quot;Tibbett had a big, bronzelike, dramatically eloquent voice that combined ringing power with remarkable agility ... he left behind not only the echoes of a great voice but the memory of a performer who could feel equally at home with high art and popular entertainment, suggesting that there is a magical link between the two.&quot; He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

Tibbett&#x27;s operatic recordings made in the United States for the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor during the 1920s and 1930s are regarded as among the better performances of this period. Many of these recordings are available on LP and CD re-issues. &quot;Dear Rogue: A Biography of the American Baritone Lawrence Tibbett&quot;, a comprehensive story of his personal life and musical career, by Hertzel Weinstat and Bert Wechsler, was published in 1996 by Amadeus Press of Portland, Oregon.

==Famous roles==

Although regarded as a dashing, compelling actor as well, Tibbett&#x27;s true fame stems from the fact that he has long been considered to be, in terms of sheer voice, one of the better baritones to appear at the Metropolitan Opera. His voice was large, with a dark timbre approaching that of a bass, and he commanded a full range of dynamics in his prime, from powerful fortes to delicate pianissimos. He was renowned for his affinity with the works of Verdi, notably his breakthrough role of Ford in &quot;Falstaff&quot;, the title role in &quot;Simon Boccanegra,&quot; and Iago in &quot;Otello&quot;. He was also an imposing, sinister Scarpia in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, a swaggering Escamillo in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, and a powerful Tonio in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;.

In addition, Tibbett created leading roles in a number of American operas, including Louis Gruenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, based on Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play. (He sang this in blackface; the character of Brutus Jones is an African-American). He starred in Howard Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Merry Mount&quot;, as well as &quot;The King&#x27;s Henchman&quot; and &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot;, operas by Deems Taylor. Tibbett performed the roles of Porgy and Jake in the first album of selections from George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, two roles which, on stage, usually are performed by black singers. Gershwin was present at the recording sessions. Continuing in this vein, Tibbett made a recording of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s song &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; from &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

Marston Records released a 10-CD set of Tibbett&#x27;s recordings in March 2024.

<doc id="142849" wikidata="Q6309165" url="?curid=142849" title="Julio César Chávez vs. Meldrick Taylor">
<text>[[Julio César Chávez]] vs. [[Meldrick Taylor]], billed as Thunder Meets Lightning, was a professional boxing match contested on March 17, 1990, for the WBC and IBF light welterweight championship. Its title was an allusion to the punching power of Chávez and fast hand speed of Taylor. Chavez won the fight by a controversial TKO of Taylor only two seconds before the end of the twelfth and last round, while he was behind on the score cards. The fight would later be named &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fight of the Year for 1990, and later the &quot;Fight of the Decade&quot; for the 1990s.

==Background==
Julio César Chávez had an undefeated record of 68–0 with 55 wins by knockout and had won world championships in three weight classes: super featherweight, lightweight and, the previous year against Roger Mayweather, the WBC light welterweight title.

Meldrick Taylor had won, at only 17 years, a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics. He also had an undefeated professional record and had won the IBF light welterweight title in 1988 from Buddy McGirt.

This fight was the third title defense for both boxers and a unification fight of the WBC and IBF title.

The fight took place only one month after Mike Tyson&#x27;s upset loss to James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas.

==The fight==
Taylor&#x27;s hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. He frequently hit Chávez with combinations and danced around the other man, making it difficult for Chávez, a skilled combination puncher who relied on an accumulation of damage to knock out his foes, to land more than one blow at a time. But coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chávez. While Taylor was ahead on the score cards late into the fight, he was dazed, especially after the end of the 11th round when Taylor nearly went into Chávez&#x27; corner, until referee Richard Steele directed him back to his own.

Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges, (Dave Moretti and Jerry Roth had the score 107–102 and 108–101 respectively for Taylor, while Chuck Giampa had Chávez ahead 105–104). However Taylor&#x27;s trainer Lou Duva told him that he needed to win the final round. Taylor showed signs of exhaustion, which included staggering around the ring, visibly wobbling as he moved. At one point, he fell to the canvas after missing Chávez with a wild left.

With about a minute left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches, and Taylor responded by mockingly feigning weakness. Finally, with 25 seconds left, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner. Chávez then dropped him with a right hand. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet while still holding the ropes and was given the mandatory standing 8-count. Referee Richard Steele then asked Taylor twice if he was okay, received no reaction and then signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout.

==Aftermath==
To this day, Steele&#x27;s decision to stop the fight remains debated.

Chávez&#x27; status was cemented by the bout, and for the next several years he was widely considered the best fighter in the world. His unbeaten streak would stretch to 89–0–1 before he suffered his first loss, to Frankie Randall. Towards the end of his career Chávez began to cut easily, a tendency that cost him several fights. Like many fighters, he continued to fight even after time had diminished his skills, and would go in and out of retirement several times. He retired for good after a loss on September 17, 2005, in a bout where he claimed to have injured his hand. His final career record stands at 108–6–2. He holds several records, including for most title defenses and championship fights.

It is popularly believed that Meldrick Taylor was never the same physically or psychologically after the Chavez bout. Sportswriter William Nack claimed that Taylor&#x27;s &quot;prime&quot; was literally beaten out of him. Dr. Flip Homansky, who examined Taylor following the fight, said that Taylor suffered broken bones behind the eye and received a transfusion for blood loss because of a cut lower lip.

Taylor would continue fighting and succeed in winning the WBA welterweight title in 1991, which he lost in 1992. He was knocked out in a rematch with Chávez in 1994, his last title fight.

Meldrick Taylor still resides in his native Philadelphia. On May 15, 2009, Taylor released a book titled &quot;Two Seconds From Glory&quot; detailing the fight with Julio Cesar Chávez along with other controversial subjects.

==Undercard==
Confirmed bouts:
*Greg Page knocks out Martis Fleming at 1:36 of round 1.

<text>The Rogue Song is a 1930 American pre-Code romantic and musical film that tells the story of a Russian bandit who falls in love with a princess, but takes his revenge on her when her brother rapes and kills his sister. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production was directed by Lionel Barrymore and released in two versions, with and without sound. Hal Roach wrote and directed the Laurel and Hardy sequences and was not credited. The film stars Metropolitan Opera singer Lawrence Tibbett—who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance—and Catherine Dale Owen. Laurel and Hardy were third-billed; their sequences were filmed at the last minute and interspersed throughout the film in an attempt to boost its potential box-office appeal.

This film, MGM&#x27;s first all-talking Technicolor film, is partially lost as there are no known complete prints of this film. Fragments do exist.

==Plot==
The story takes place in the Russian Empire in the year 1910. Yegor (Lawrence Tibbett), a dashing (as well as singing) bandit leader meets Princess Vera (Catherine Dale Owen) at a mountain inn. They fall in love, but the relationship is shattered when Yegor kills Vera&#x27;s brother, Prince Serge, for raping his sister, Nadja, and driving her to suicide. Yegor kidnaps Vera, forcing her to live a life of lowly servitude among the bandits. Vera manages to outwit Yegor, who is captured by soldiers and flogged. Vera begs Yegor&#x27;s forgiveness. Although still in love with each other, they realize they cannot be together.

==Laurel and Hardy==

There were eight comic episodes throughout the film in which Laurel and Hardy appeared. One of these has survived on film. In this scene, there is a storm and a tent is blown away revealing Stan and Oliver. They try to sleep without any cover. A bear enters a cave. Stan and Oliver decide to seek shelter in the cave and, because it is so dark, they can&#x27;t see the bear. Oliver thinks that Stan is wearing a fur coat. The bear begins to growl. Stan and Oliver flee.

Another segment, in which Laurel swallows a bee, has also survived on the trailer to the film, which has survived almost intact.

==Production==

The film is MGM&#x27;s first all-talking, all-color (Technicolor) production. It was also the screen debut of Lawrence Tibbett, a world-renowned star of the Metropolitan Opera. The film is notable today as Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s first and only appearance in a color feature film (all of their feature films before and after were shot in black-and-white; their only other professionally shot color film was the wartime short &quot;The Tree in a Test Tube&quot;), although they were only minor players in the film.

The film was adapted by John Colton and Frances Marion from the operetta &quot;Gipsy Love&quot;, book by Robert Bodanzky and A. M. Willner, music by Franz Lehár.

Production was supervised by Paul Bern, and the anticipated 30-day shooting schedule began on August 29, 1929. The studio executives&#x27; response to the daily &quot;rushes&quot; was that the film was not working well and needed help. MGM borrowed Laurel and Hardy from Hal Roach, and after negotiations between Roach and Thalberg, Roach agreed to write and direct their scenes. The final film has eight scenes with the comedy duo. Principal photography ended on October 11.

==Release==
The film premiered in Hollywood at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on January 17, 1930.

Although Laurel and Hardy were minor players in the film, opera star Lawrence Tibbett was virtually unknown in much of the United States. As a result, in many places the film was advertised as &quot;Laurel &amp; Hardy in &quot;The Rogue Song&quot;&quot;.

==Preservation status==
Although the film is considered to be lost, as there are no known complete prints, some fragments have been found. A two and a half minute fragment that had been cut out of the film by a local projectionist was found in a bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1981, it featured a comic segment with Laurel and Hardy hiding in a cave in which a bear has taken shelter. Another 500 foot piece, about 10 minutes long, which showed a ballet sequence by Albertina Rasch was found in Maine in 1998 and was restored by UCLA. Another reel of assorted clips is in the Czech Film Archive; it was screened at a convention in 1995. Another short fragment shows Lawrence Tibbett singing to Catherine Dale Owen as they are caught in a storm.

The film&#x27;s trailer, which includes Laurel and Hardy, is extant except for the first 60 seconds, which were lost due to decomposition; the remainder was transferred to safety stock by UCLA. In the trailer, Tibbett sings &quot;White Dove&quot; to Owen. A short segment featuring the comics Laurel &amp; Hardy is also seen in which Laurel has apparently swallowed a bee.

In addition to those film fragments, the complete soundtrack of the film and the trailer survived because it was re-recorded on Vitaphone disks for theaters that did not have optical sound systems, such as the Movietone system, which MGM usually utilized.

The estate of Lawrence Tibbett held a color copy of the entire &quot;Rogue Song&quot; for many years after his death. Tibbett liked the film and showed it frequently to his friends. The late Allan Jones was a regular visitor and friend and reportedly gained possession of the print, which his son Jack Jones destroyed because of nitrate film decomposition. Tibbett had recorded some of the songs from the film in studio recordings released by RCA Victor.

YouTube currently (November 2020) contains a reconstruction of the entire film, utilizing the complete soundtrack, the half hour or so of existing footage, and stills from the film.

MGM held the negative of reel four until early 1974.
