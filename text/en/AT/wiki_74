<text>The Canon of Medicine (; ; ) is an encyclopedia of medicine in five books compiled by Persian physician-philosopher Avicenna (, ibn Sina) and completed in 1025. It is among the most influential works of its time. It presents an overview of the contemporary medical knowledge of the Islamic world, which had been influenced by earlier traditions including Greco-Roman medicine (particularly Galen), Persian medicine, Chinese medicine and Indian medicine. Its translation from Arabic to Latin in 12th century Toledo greatly influenced the development of medieval medicine. It became the standard textbook for teaching in European universities into the early modern period.

&quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; remained a medical authority for centuries. It set the standards for medicine in medieval Europe and the Islamic world and was used as a standard medical textbook through the 18th century in Europe. It is an important text in Unani medicine, a form of traditional medicine practiced in India.

==Title==
The English title &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; is derived from the common medieval Latin &quot;Canon Medicinae,&quot; itself a translation of the original Arabic (), with the same meaning. &quot;Canon&quot; (often translated in English as &quot;law&quot; or &quot;legal code&quot;) here connotes an ordered system, or complete, universal encyclopedia. The common medieval version of the title was &quot;Liber Canonis&quot;.

==Development==
The medical traditions of Galen, and thereby Hippocrates, had dominated Islamic medicine from its beginnings. Avicenna sought to fit these traditions into Aristotle&#x27;s natural philosophy. He began writing the &quot;Canon&quot; in Gorganj, continued in Rey and completed it in Hamadan in 1025. The result was a &quot;clear and ordered &quot;summa&quot; of all the medical knowledge of Ibn Sīnā&#x27;s time&quot;. It served as a more concise reference in contrast to Galen&#x27;s twenty volumes of medical corpus.

==Overview==

&quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; is divided into five books:
#Essays on basic medical and physiological principles, anatomy, regimen and general therapeutic procedures.
#List of medical substances, arranged alphabetically, following an essay on their general properties.
#Diagnosis and treatment of diseases specific to one part of the body
#Diagnosis and treatment of conditions covering multiple body parts or the entire body.
#Formulary of compound remedies.

Books 1, 3, and 4 are each further divided into parts (&quot;fanns)&quot;, chapters (&quot;ta’līms),&quot; subchapters (&quot;jumlahs)&quot;, sections (&quot;faṣls&quot;), and subsections (&quot;bābs&quot;).

==Book 1==
Book 1 is made up of six theses which give a general description of medicine in general, the cosmic elements that make up the cosmos and the human body, the mutual interaction of elements (temperaments), fluids of the body (humours), human anatomy, and physiology. The book explains the causes of health and disease. Avicenna believed that the human body cannot be restored to health unless the causes of both health and disease are determined. He defined medicine (&quot;tibb&quot;) as follows:

===Thesis I Definition and Scope of Medicine===
Avicenna begins part one by dividing theoretical medicine and medical practice. He describes what he says are the &quot;four causes&quot; of illness, based on Aristotelian philosophy: The material cause, the efficient cause, the formal cause, and the final cause:

#Material Cause: Avicenna says that this cause is the human subject itself, the &quot;members or the breath&quot; or &quot;the humours&quot; indirectly.
#Efficient Cause: The efficient cause is broken up into two categories: The first is &quot;Extrinsic&quot;, or the sources external to the human body such as air or the region we live in. The second efficient cause is the &quot;Intrinsic&quot;, or the internal sources such as our sleep and &quot;its opposite-the waking state&quot;, the &quot;different periods of life&quot;, habits, and race.
#Formal Cause: The formal cause is what Avicenna called &quot;the constitutions; the compositions&quot;. According to Oskar Cameron Gruner, who provides a treatise within Avicenna&#x27;s Canon of Medicine, this was in agreement with Galen who believed that the formal cause of illness is based upon the individual&#x27;s temperament.
#Final Cause: The final cause is given as &quot;the actions or functions&quot;.

===Thesis II The Elements of Cosmology===
Avicenna&#x27;s thesis on the elements of the cosmos is described by Gruner as &quot;the foundation of the whole &quot;Canon&quot;&quot;. Avicenna insists here that a physician must assume the four elements that are described by natural philosophy, although Avicenna makes it clear that he distinguishes between the &quot;simple&quot; element, not mixed with anything else, and what we actually experience as water or air, such as the sea or the atmosphere. The elements we experience are mixed with small amounts of other elements and are therefore not the pure elemental substances. The &quot;light&quot; elements are fire and air, while the &quot;heavy&quot; are earth and water:

#The Earth: Avicenna upholds Aristotelian philosophy by describing Earth as an element that is geocentric. The Earth is at rest, and other things tend towards it because of its intrinsic weight. It is cold and dry.
#The Water: Water is described as being exterior to the sphere of the Earth and interior to the sphere of the Air, because of its relative density. It is cold and moist. &quot;Being moist, shapes can be readily fashioned (with it), and as easily lost (and resolved).&quot;
#The Air: The position of Air above Water and beneath Fire is &quot;due to its relative lightness&quot;. It is &quot;hot and moist&quot;, and its effect is to &quot;rarefy&quot; and make things &quot;softer&quot;.
#The (sphere of the) Fire: Fire is higher than the other elements, &quot;for it reaches to the world of the heavens&quot;. It is hot and dry; it traverses the substance of the air, and subdues the coldness of the two heavy elements; &quot;by this power it brings the elementary properties into harmony.&quot;

===Thesis III The Temperaments===
The &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; divides the thesis on temperaments into three subsections; a general overview, one based on members of the body, and temperaments based on age.

====I The Temperaments (General description)====
The temperaments are reported to be the interaction between the four different element&#x27;s qualities, such as the conflict between dryness, wetness, cold, and hot. Avicenna suggests that these qualities battle between each other until an equilibrium state is reached and this state is known as the temperaments.

The &quot;Canon&quot; also adopted the ancient theory of Four Temperaments and extended it to encompass &quot;emotional aspects, mental capacity, moral attitudes, self-awareness, movements and dreams&quot;. This expanded theory of four temperaments is given in the following table:

;The Eight Varieties of Equipoise
Canon describes humans as having eight different &quot;varieties of equipoise&quot;, or differing temperaments. The temperaments fall under two categories; In relation to beings other than men and in relation to the individual himself.

;A. In relation to beings other than men
i. &quot;the equability of the temperament seen in man as compared with other creatures&quot;
ii. the temperament of other human beings
:Avicenna describes a hot versus cold / moist versus dry equilibrium between the members of the human body. The heart, for example, is hot and must be in equilibrium of other cold parts of the body such as the brain. When this equilibrium between these members are achieved, the person is considered to be in &quot;ideal equability&quot;.
iii. external factors &quot;such as race, climate, atmosphere&quot;
:This third gauge for temperament assumes that each race has their own equilibrium. As an example he says, &quot;The Hindus, in health, have a different equability to the Slaves, and so on.&quot; Avicenna explains that the differing climates contribute to differing temperaments among the races.
iv. in relation to extreme climates
;B. In relation to the individual himself
v. &quot;as compared to another person&quot;
:Although Avicenna had listed the fifth mode &quot;as compared to another person&quot;, he seems to contradict that statement by explaining that every individual has a temperament that is unique to themselves and unlike anyone else.
vi. comparison of the individual himself
vii. comparing one member of the body with another member of the body
:The &quot;Canon&quot; here makes the distinction of the members into categories of their individual &quot;moistness&quot;, &quot;dryness&quot;, &quot;hotness&quot;, and &quot;coldness&quot;.
viii. comparison of a member to itself

&quot;The Canon&quot; continues to explain the sun&#x27;s position in relation to ideal temperament and the role that climate and human skin play. Organs are nowhere near ideal in temperament, but skin comes the closest. Avicenna says that the hand, especially the palm and the tip of the index finger, is the most sensitive of all and attuned to tactile contact. Medicine is described as &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;, not based upon its actual temperature but with regard to how it relates to the temperament of the human body.

&quot;The Canon&quot; then describes when temperaments are unequal, in other words, illness. Avicenna separates these into two categories, which are fairly self explainable within the context of what he had already defined as the temperaments.
;A. Simple &quot;intemperaments&quot;
#Hot temperament (hotter than normal)
#Cold temperament (colder than normal)
#Dry temperament (drier than usual)
#Moist temperament (more moist than usual)

;B. Compound &quot;intemperaments&quot;
The compound intemperaments are where two things are wrong with the temperament, i.e. hotter and moister; hotter and drier; colder and moister; colder and drier. There are only four because something cannot be simultaneously hotter and colder or drier and moister. The four simple temperaments and four compound intemperaments can each be divided into &quot;Those apart from any material substance&quot; and &quot;Those in which some material substance is concerned&quot;, for a total of sixteen intemperaments. Examples of the sixteen intemperaments are provided in the &quot;third and fourth volumes.&quot;

====II The Temperament of the Several Members====
Each member of the body is described to be given each its individual temperament, each with its own degree of heat and moisture. Avicenna lists members of the body in &quot;order of degree of Heat&quot;, from hottest to coldest.
#The breath and &quot;the heart in which it arises&quot;; 
#The blood; which is said to be generated from the liver; 
#The liver, which may be looked upon as concentrated blood; 
#The flesh, which would be as hot as the liver were it not for the nervous tissue which pervades it; 
#The muscles, which are cooler than the flesh because of their tendons and ligaments, as well as the nerves; 
#The spleen, which is colder because of the faex of the blood;
#The kidneys;
#The wall of the arteries;
#The veins;
#The skin of the palms and soles.

Then a list is given of coldest members to hottest.
#The serious humour;
#The hairs;
#The bones;
#The cartilage;
#The ligaments;
#The tendon;
#The membranes;
#The nerves;
#The spinal cord;
#The brain;
#The fat;
#The oil of the body; 
#The skin.

Then a list is given in order of moisture. Avicenna credits Galen with this particular list.
#The serious humour
#The blood
#The oil
#the fat
#the brain
#the spinal cord
#the breasts and the testicles
#the lung
#the liver
#the spleen
#the kidneys
#the muscles
#the skin

Finally, a list is given in order of dryness
#the hair
#the bone
#cartilage
#ligaments
#tendons
#sereous membranes
#arteries
#veins
#motor nerves
#heart
#sensory nerves
#skin

====III The Temperaments Belonging to Age====

&quot;The Canon&quot; divides life into four &quot;periods&quot; and then subdivides the first period into five separate categories.

The following table is provided for the four periods of life:
Avicenna says that the third period shows signs of decline in vigor and some decline in intellectual power. In the fourth period, both vigor and intelligence decline.

Avicenna divides the beginning stage of life in the following table, according to Oskar Cameron Gruner&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;:
Avicenna generalizes youth as having a &quot;hot&quot; temperament, but comments that there is controversy over which periods of youth are hotter. The general notion that youth are &quot;hot&quot; in temperament is due to youth&#x27;s supposed relationship to members of the body that are hot. For example, blood was considered &quot;hot&quot; as was mentioned earlier, therefore youth is assumed to be hot partially due to blood being more &quot;plentiful&quot; and &quot;thicker&quot;, according to Avicenna. Evidence for youth having an excess of blood is suggested by Avicenna&#x27;s observation that nose bleeds are more frequent within youth. Other contributing factors are the youth&#x27;s association with sperm and the consistency of their bile. Further description of youth in regards to heat and moisture is given with respect to sex, geographical location, and occupation. &quot;The Canon&quot; says, for example, that females are colder and more moist.

===The Humours===
&quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; is based upon the Four Humours of Hippocratic medicine, but refined in various ways. In disease pathogenesis, for example, Avicenna &quot;added his own view of different types of spirits (or vital life essences) and souls, whose disturbances might lead to bodily diseases because of a close association between them and such master organs as the brain and heart&quot;. An element of such belief is apparent in the chapter of &quot;al-Lawa&quot;, which relates &quot;the manifestations to an interruption of vital life essence to the brain.&quot; He combined his own view with that of the Four Humours to establish a new doctrine to explain the mechanisms of various diseases in another work he wrote, &quot;Treatise on Pulse&quot;:



====Definition of body fluid====
&quot;The Canon&quot; defines a humour as &quot;that fluid, moist &#x27;body&#x27; into which our aliment is transformed&quot;, and lists the four primary types of fluids as sanguineous, serous, bilious, and atrabilious. The secondary fluids are separated into &quot;non-excrementitious&quot; and &quot;excrementitious&quot;.

====The sanguineous humour====
Avicenna calls this humour &quot;the most excellent of all&quot; the humours. This section describes blood and compares its healthy states with its unhealthy states. Avicenna describes healthy blood as &quot;red in colour, has no unpleasant odour, and has a very sweet taste.&quot; Abnormality of the blood stems from a change in temperament or an unhealthy humour has polluted it.

====The serous humour====
The serous humour is described as a sweet fluid that is cold and moist in relation to blood and bilious humours. Serous humour resembles blood and is necessary for body tissues for two reasons: to provide the tissue with nutrients as an auxiliary and to keep the bones and tissues moist.

====The bilious humour====
The bilious humour is red and clear in colour and is light and pungent. It can pursue two routes, either into the blood or the gallbladder. When it passes into the blood, its function is to attenuate the blood in such a way, that it enables the blood to transverse the very minutest channels of the body. The part which flows to the gallbladder is needed, since it cleanses the entire body of superfluity and nourishes the gallbladder.

====The atrabilious humour====
The atrabilious humor is considered dry and cold, created from sediment of good blood. It originates from the liver and then travels to either the blood or spleen. That which goes to the blood aids in nourishment for things like the bones, as well as strengthens the blood. The spleen receives what is not needed in the blood, and nourishes the spleen, helps clean the body, and controls appetite. Excrementitious atrabilious humor is described as a bitter ash.

===Anatomy or &quot;The Members&quot;===
In his thesis on &quot;The Members&quot;, Avicenna explains that the humours help to make up the members of the body, gives a general description and how to repair them.
Some are &quot;simple members&quot; or &quot;elementary tissue&quot; such as bone, cartilage and tendons. Some are &quot;compound members&quot; such as the heart, the liver, and the brain. He also categorizes these into vital organs and auxiliary organs.
Avicenna continues to classify the organs by different systems. &quot;According to actions&quot; organizes members by what they do. &quot;According to their origin&quot; classifies members by assuming that each member originates from the blood or from male or &quot;female sperm&quot;.

===General Physiology===
In the thesis on General Physiology or &quot;The Faculties of the Body&quot;, Avicenna separates life into three different categories: Vital, Natural, and Animal. He contrasts Galen&#x27;s view that the brain is the &quot;chief seat of sentient life&quot; with Aristotle&#x27;s view that the heart is the source of all the body&#x27;s faculties, saying that if physicians considered the matter carefully they would agree with Aristotle that the heart was the ultimate source of all the faculties, even if (for example) the brain is where the rational faculty manifests itself.

==Book 2 Materia Medica==
Book 2 (the Materia Medica) of the &quot;Canon&quot; alphabetically lists about 800 &quot;simple&quot; medical substances that were used at the time. The substances are simple in the sense of not being compounded with other substances. The first part gives general rules about drugs and a treatise on what was called &quot;the science of powers of medicines&quot;. The second part is a list of 800 simple floral, mineral, and animal substances. Each entry contains the substance&#x27;s name, its criteria of goodness (which sometimes describes how the substance is found in nature), and its nature or primary qualities. Next are listed one or more of 22 possible general actions, followed by specific properties listed according to a grid of 11 disease types. Finally, potential substitutes for the substances are given.

The &quot;Canon&quot; contains seven rules for experimenting with new drugs, taken partly from Galen.

#&quot;The drug must be free from any acquired quality&quot;; for example from being exposed to heat or cold or stored in close proximity to other substances.
#&quot;The experiment must done on a single, not a composite condition&quot;; in other words it should not be tested on a patient who has complex or multiple illnesses.
#&quot;The drug must be tested on two contrary conditions&quot;; a drug may act directly on a disease but also it may be effective against a different disease by relieving its symptoms.
#&quot;The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease...it is best to experiment first using the weakest [dosage] and then increase it gradually until you know the potency of the drug, leaving no room for doubt.&quot;
#&quot;One should consider the time needed for the drug to take effect. If the drug has an immediate effect, this shows that it has acted against the disease itself.&quot;
#&quot;The effect of the drug should be the same in all cases or, at least, in most. If that is not the case, the effect is then accidental, because things that occur naturally are always or mostly consistent.&quot;
#&quot;Experiments should be carried out on the human body [...] the quality of the medicine might mean that it would affect the human body differently from the animal body...&quot;

==Book 3 Special Pathology==
Book 3 is arranged by body part, progressing from the top of the body to the bottom of the body and covering the function and diseases of each organ, as well as the etiology, symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for each disease discussed. The third book is also divided into several sections, including:

1. Head, Eye, Ear, Nose, Mouth, Throat, Teeth

2. Chest, Lung, Heart

3. Alimentary tract: stomach, intestines; liver, gall-bladder, and spleen

4. Urinary system

5. Conception, Pregnancy, the Uterus, Diseases of women.

6. The Muscles, The Joints, The Feet.

7. Special subjects: The intemperaments of the Brain; Headache; diseases of the Brain, Epilepsy, Paralysis.

The information presented in Book 3 of the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; represents some of Avicenna&#x27;s most important contributions to several fields of study, including atherosclerosis, pulsology, migraines, cataracts, vasovagal syncope, and neuroscience.

=== Stroke ===
Strokes are described in extensive detail in Book 3 of the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;. First, two causes of stroke are identified: blockage of vessels in the brain, and blockage of the affective spirit of the brain, a cause that can only be explained using theories on humoral medicine. The blockage of vessels is then further subdivided into two sub-types: collapse and ischemia.[11]

Following this description of the causes of stroke, Avicenna discusses how the blocking agents are derived from the blood or phlegm humors, and how these are most abundant in people with wet and cold natures. Book 3 of the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; also lists several manifestations of stroke: asphyxia, hemiplegia, &quot;headache with jugular vein engorgement, dizziness, vertigo, darkened vision, tremor, anxiety, weakness, grinding teeth during sleep, and dark urine with particles&quot;, and it distinguishes between the different causes and types of stroke: cold stroke, coma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and trauma. Finally, Book 3 discusses several treatments for stroke including the use of herbal medicines and &quot;non-pharmacological interventions such as venesection and dry or wet cupping on the lower neck and upper back&quot;. While the accounts of the causes and treatments of stroke are based upon theories of humoral medicine, these descriptions are still similar to the modern understanding of strokes.

=== Neuroscience ===
Book 3 also contains an extensive chapter about neuroscience, which &quot;begins by explaining the structure and function of the nervous system, ...parts of the brain, the spinal cord, the ventricles, meninges, nerves and roots, ... [and] neurological and neuropsychological disorders, including signs and symptoms and treatment strategies&quot;.

Furthermore, several specific neurological conditions are described, including: epilepsy, apoplexy and stroke, paralysis, vertigo, spasm, wry mouth, tremor, meningitis, amnesia and dementia, head injuries and traumas, hysteria and conversion disorder, fainting and stupor, nervous tic, sexual disorders, love sickness, delusion and hallucination, insomnia, sopor, nightmare, mania and psychosis, melancholia, paranoia, asthenia, hydrocephalus, and sciatica. Book 3 of the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; also describes fifteen kinds of headaches, as well as descriptions of treatments for each of these conditions that are divided into three steps:

1. Change of lifestyle

2. Simple medicines

3. Compound medicines

Surgical intervention and other non-pharmacological strategies were also recommended in some cases, such as electrical shocks to treat epilepsy.

==Book 4 Special Diseases Involving More Than One Member==
Book 4 covers diseases that affect the whole body such as fevers or poisons, or conditions that could happen to any part of it such as wounds or bone fractures. The book &quot;concludes with a treatise on personal hygiene, emphasizing care of the hair, skin, nails, body odor, and the treatment of overweight or underweight persons.&quot;

In Book 4 – as with other ancient Islamic medical writings – large sections were devoted to covering fevers in great detail. Several types of fevers were distinguished, partly based on the location of the factors causing each specific illness:

1. Ephemeral (involving the pneuma)

2. Putrid (putrefaction of humoral residues)

3. Hectic (occurring in a major organ)

Each of these classifications were further subdivided: for example, Avicenna also listed 23 different types of ephemeral fevers in Book 4 of the &quot;Canon of Medicine.&quot;

==Book 5 Formulary==

Book 5 (the Formulary) lists 650 compound drugs, attributing them to various Arabic, Indian and Greek sources. Avicenna added comments, highlighting differences between recipes from different sources, and sometimes giving his recipe. He also gave his opinion of the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of some remedies and gave details of where particular ingredients came from and how they were prepared. He favoured proven remedies which had been tested through experience, cautioning that compounds could have unexpected or much stronger effects than might be expected from the effects of the individual components.

==Legacy and reception==

The &quot;Qanun&quot; was translated into Latin as &quot;Canon medicinae&quot; by Gerard of Cremona. (Confusingly, there appear to have been two men called Gerard of Cremona, both translators of Arabic texts into Latin. Ostler states that it was the later of these, also known as Gerard de Sabloneta, who translated the &quot;Qanun&quot; (and other medical works) into Latin in the 13th century.) The encyclopaedic content, systematic arrangement, and combination of Galen&#x27;s medicine with Aristotle&#x27;s science and philosophy helped the &quot;Canon&quot; enter European scholastic medicine. Medical scholars started to use the &quot;Canon&quot; in the 13th century, while university courses implemented the text from the 14th century onwards. The &quot;Canon&quot;″s influence declined in the 16th century as a result of humanists&#x27; preference in medicine for ancient Greek and Roman authorities over Arabic authorities, although others defended Avicenna&#x27;s innovations beyond the original classical texts. It fell out of favour in university syllabi, although it was still being taught as background literature as late as 1715 in Padua.

The earliest known copy of volume 5 of the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; (dated 1052) is held in the collection of the Aga Khan and is housed in the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The earliest printed edition of the Latin &quot;Canon&quot; appeared in 1472, but only covering book 3. Soon after, eleven complete incunables were published, followed by fourteen more Latin editions in the 16th century until 1608.

In addition to Latin, the &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; was translated into Hebrew by Nathan ha-Meati during the 13th century, and complete translations were also made into Turkish and Persian during the 18th century.

William Osler described the &quot;Canon&quot; as &quot;the most famous medical textbook ever written,&quot; noting that it remained &quot;a medical bible for a longer time than any other work.&quot;

<text>Limnology ( ; ) is the study of inland aquatic ecosystems. 
The study of limnology includes aspects of the biological, chemical, physical, and geological characteristics of fresh and saline, natural and man-made bodies of water. This includes the study of lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, springs, streams, wetlands, and groundwater. Water systems are often categorized as either running (lotic) or standing (lentic).

Limnology includes the study of the drainage basin, movement of water through the basin and biogeochemical changes that occur en route. A more recent sub-discipline of limnology, termed landscape limnology, studies, manages, and seeks to conserve these ecosystems using a landscape perspective, by explicitly examining connections between an aquatic ecosystem and its drainage basin. Recently, the need to understand global inland waters as part of the Earth system created a sub-discipline called global limnology. This approach considers processes in inland waters on a global scale, like the role of inland aquatic ecosystems in global biogeochemical cycles.

Limnology is closely related to aquatic ecology and hydrobiology, which study aquatic organisms and their interactions with the abiotic (non-living) environment. While limnology has substantial overlap with freshwater-focused disciplines (e.g., freshwater biology), it also includes the study of inland salt lakes.

==History==
The term limnology was coined by François-Alphonse Forel (1841–1912) who established the field with his studies of Lake Geneva. Interest in the discipline rapidly expanded, and in 1922 August Thienemann (a German zoologist) and Einar Naumann (a Swedish botanist) co-founded the International Society of Limnology (SIL, from Societas Internationalis Limnologiae). Forel&#x27;s original definition of limnology, &quot;the oceanography of lakes&quot;, was expanded to encompass the study of all inland waters, and influenced Benedykt Dybowski&#x27;s work on Lake Baikal.

Prominent early American limnologists included G. Evelyn Hutchinson and Ed Deevey. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Edward A. Birge, Chancey Juday, Charles R. Goldman, and Arthur D. Hasler contributed to the development of the Center for Limnology.

==General limnology==

===Physical properties===
Physical properties of aquatic ecosystems are determined by a combination of heat, currents, waves and other seasonal distributions of environmental conditions. The morphometry of a body of water depends on the type of feature (such as a lake, river, stream, wetland, estuary etc.) and the structure of the earth surrounding the body of water. Lakes, for instance, are classified by their formation, and zones of lakes are defined by water depth. River and stream system morphometry is driven by underlying geology of the area as well as the general velocity of the water. Stream morphometry is also influenced by topography (especially slope) as well as precipitation patterns and other factors such as vegetation and land development. Connectivity between streams and lakes relates to the landscape drainage density, lake surface area and lake shape. 
Other types of aquatic systems which fall within the study of limnology are estuaries. Estuaries are bodies of water classified by the interaction of a river and the ocean or sea. Wetlands vary in size, shape, and pattern however the most common types, marshes, bogs and swamps, often fluctuate between containing shallow, freshwater and being dry depending on the time of year. The volume and quality of water in underground aquifers rely on the vegetation cover, which fosters recharge and aids in maintaining water quality.

====Light interactions====
Light zonation is the concept of how the amount of sunlight penetration into water influences the structure of a body of water. These zones define various levels of productivity within an aquatic ecosystems such as a lake. For instance, the depth of the water column which sunlight is able to penetrate and where most plant life is able to grow is known as the photic or euphotic zone. The rest of the water column which is deeper and does not receive sufficient amounts of sunlight for plant growth is known as the aphotic zone. The amount of solar energy present underwater and the spectral quality of the light that are present at various depths have a significant impact on the behavior of many aquatic organisms. For example, zooplankton&#x27;s vertical migration is influenced by solar energy levels.

====Thermal stratification====
Similar to light zonation, thermal stratification or thermal zonation is a way of grouping parts of the water body within an aquatic system based on the temperature of different lake layers. The less turbid the water, the more light is able to penetrate, and thus heat is conveyed deeper in the water. Heating declines exponentially with depth in the water column, so the water will be warmest near the surface but progressively cooler as moving downwards. There are three main sections that define thermal stratification in a lake. The epilimnion is closest to the water surface and absorbs long- and shortwave radiation to warm the water surface. During cooler months, wind shear can contribute to cooling of the water surface. The thermocline is an area within the water column where water temperatures rapidly decrease. The bottom layer is the hypolimnion, which tends to have the coldest water because its depth restricts sunlight from reaching it. In temperate lakes, fall-season cooling of surface water results in turnover of the water column, where the thermocline is disrupted, and the lake temperature profile becomes more uniform. In cold climates, when water cools below 4oC (the temperature of maximum density) many lakes can experience an inverse thermal stratification in winter. These lakes are often dimictic, with a brief spring overturn in addition to longer fall overturn. The relative thermal resistance is the energy needed to mix these strata of different temperatures.

====Lake Heat Budget====
An annual heat budget, also shown as θa, is the total amount of heat needed to raise the water from its minimum winter temperature to its maximum summer temperature. This can be calculated by integrating the area of the lake at each depth interval (Az) multiplied by the difference between the summer (θsz) and winter (θwz) temperatures or formula_1Az(θsz-θwz)

===Chemical properties===
The chemical composition of water in aquatic ecosystems is influenced by natural characteristics and processes including precipitation, underlying soil and bedrock in the drainage basin, erosion, evaporation, and sedimentation. All bodies of water have a certain composition of both organic and inorganic elements and compounds. Biological reactions also affect the chemical properties of water. In addition to natural processes, human activities strongly influence the chemical composition of aquatic systems and their water quality.

&quot;Allochthonous&quot; sources of carbon or nutrients come from outside the aquatic system (such as plant and soil material). Carbon sources from within the system, such as algae and the microbial breakdown of aquatic particulate organic carbon, are &quot;autochthonous&quot;. In aquatic food webs, the portion of biomass derived from allochthonous material is then named &quot;allochthony&quot;. In streams and small lakes, allochthonous sources of carbon are dominant while in large lakes and the ocean, autochthonous sources dominate.

==== Oxygen and carbon dioxide ====
Dissolved oxygen and dissolved carbon dioxide are often discussed together due their coupled role in respiration and photosynthesis. Dissolved oxygen concentrations can be altered by physical, chemical, and biological processes and reaction. Physical processes including wind mixing can increase dissolved oxygen concentrations, particularly in surface waters of aquatic ecosystems. Because dissolved oxygen solubility is linked to water temperatures, changes in temperature affect dissolved oxygen concentrations as warmer water has a lower capacity to &quot;hold&quot; oxygen as colder water. Biologically, both photosynthesis and aerobic respiration affect dissolved oxygen concentrations. Photosynthesis by autotrophic organisms, such as phytoplankton and aquatic algae, increases dissolved oxygen concentrations while simultaneously reducing carbon dioxide concentrations, since carbon dioxide is taken up during photosynthesis. All aerobic organisms in the aquatic environment take up dissolved oxygen during aerobic respiration, while carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct of this reaction. Because photosynthesis is light-limited, both photosynthesis and respiration occur during the daylight hours, while only respiration occurs during dark hours or in dark portions of an ecosystem. The balance between dissolved oxygen production and consumption is calculated as the aquatic metabolism rate.

Vertical changes in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen are affected by both wind mixing of surface waters and the balance between photosynthesis and respiration of organic matter. These vertical changes, known as profiles, are based on similar principles as thermal stratification and light penetration. As light availability decreases deeper in the water column, photosynthesis rates also decrease, and less dissolved oxygen is produced. This means that dissolved oxygen concentrations generally decrease as you move deeper into the body of water because of photosynthesis is not replenishing dissolved oxygen that is being taken up through respiration. During periods of thermal stratification, water density gradients prevent oxygen-rich surface waters from mixing with deeper waters. Prolonged periods of stratification can result in the depletion of bottom-water dissolved oxygen; when dissolved oxygen concentrations are below 2 milligrams per liter, waters are considered hypoxic. When dissolved oxygen concentrations are approximately 0 milligrams per liter, conditions are anoxic. Both hypoxic and anoxic waters reduce available habitat for organisms that respire oxygen, and contribute to changes in other chemical reactions in the water.

==== Nitrogen and phosphorus ====
Nitrogen and phosphorus are ecologically significant nutrients in aquatic systems. Nitrogen is generally present as a gas in aquatic ecosystems however most water quality studies tend to focus on nitrate, nitrite and ammonia levels. Most of these dissolved nitrogen compounds follow a seasonal pattern with greater concentrations in the fall and winter months compared to the spring and summer. Phosphorus has a different role in aquatic ecosystems as it is a limiting factor in the growth of phytoplankton because of generally low concentrations in the water. Dissolved phosphorus is also crucial to all living things, is often very limiting to primary productivity in freshwater, and has its own distinctive ecosystem cycling.

===Biological properties===
====Role in ecology====
Lakes &quot;are relatively easy to sample, because they have clear-cut boundaries (compared to terrestrial ecosystems) and because field experiments are relatively easy to perform.&quot;, which make then especially useful for ecologists who try to understand ecological dynamics.

====Lake trophic classification====
One way to classify lakes (or other bodies of water) is with the trophic state index. An oligotrophic lake is characterized by relatively low levels of primary production and low levels of nutrients. A eutrophic lake has high levels of primary productivity due to very high nutrient levels. Eutrophication of a lake can lead to algal blooms. Dystrophic lakes have high levels of humic matter and typically have yellow-brown, tea-coloured waters. These categories do not have rigid specifications; the classification system can be seen as more of a spectrum encompassing the various levels of aquatic productivity.

== Tropical limnology ==
Tropical limnology is a unique and important subfield of limnology that focuses on the distinct physical, chemical, biological, and cultural aspects of freshwater systems in tropical regions. The physical and chemical properties of tropical aquatic environments are different from those in temperate regions, with warmer and more stable temperatures, higher nutrient levels, and more complex ecological interactions. Moreover, the biodiversity of tropical freshwater systems is typically higher, human impacts are often more severe, and there are important cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence the use and management of these systems.

== Professional organizations ==
People who study limnology are called limnologists. These scientists largely study the characteristics of inland fresh-water systems such as lakes, rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands. They may also study non-oceanic bodies of salt water, such as the Great Salt Lake. There are many professional organizations related to limnology and other aspects of the aquatic science, including the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, the Asociación Ibérica de Limnología, the International Society of Limnology, the Polish Limnological Society, the Society of Canadian Limnologists, and the Freshwater Biological Association.

<doc id="145244" wikidata="Q1839277" url="?curid=145244" title="Fozzie Bear">
<text>Fozzie Bear is a Muppet character from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, best known as the insecure and comedically fruitless stand-up comic&quot;.&quot; Fozzie is an orange-brown bear who often wears a brown pork pie hat and a pink and white polka dot necktie. The character debuted on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, as the series&#x27; resident comedian, a role where he uses the catchphrase &quot;Wocka wocka!&quot; to indicate that he had completed a joke. He was often the target of ridicule, particularly from balcony hecklers Statler and Waldorf. Fozzie was performed by Frank Oz until 2000, after which Eric Jacobson became the character&#x27;s principal performer.

==History==
Fozzie Bear was specifically created to act as a &quot;second banana&quot; to Kermit the Frog. He was built around the concept of a comedian in the style of Red Skelton and Milton Berle. Designed by Michael K. Frith, the origin of Fozzie&#x27;s name has been traditionally thought to be a pun of performer Frank Oz&#x27;s name (F.Oz). It was also believed that the character was actually named after Al Fuzzie, the mascot of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority in the mid-1970s; Henson&#x27;s wife, Jane, was a member of the sorority. However, Oz confirmed on Twitter in 2018 that Fozzie was named after Franz Fazakas, a Muppet workshop person, who was nicknamed &quot;Faz&quot;. Fazakas created the original puppet&#x27;s ear-wiggling effects.

Fozzie Bear was originally Oz&#x27;s main character. The popularity of Miss Piggy overtook Fozzie&#x27;s, but he remained popular. One of his largest roles ever was in &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;, where he took all of his friends to his mother&#x27;s farm for Christmas.

In 1988, Fozzie was featured in the VHS release &quot;Hey, You&#x27;re as Funny as Fozzie Bear&quot;, part of the Jim Henson Company&#x27;s &quot;Play-Along Video&quot; series. In the video, Fozzie instructs young viewers in various comedy techniques. The concept for the &quot;Play-Along Video&quot; came from Jim Henson&#x27;s idea that television could be used as an interactive medium and encourage children&#x27;s creativity.

During the 1990s, his roles became much smaller, due to the fact that Oz had turned his focus to directing non-Muppet films and reduced his time with the Muppets. Fozzie was only a supporting character in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, and &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, and only appeared in six episodes of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;. However, he returned to prominence when Eric Jacobson took over in 2002, beginning with &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;, in which Fozzie was the focus of a number of scenes.

An original puppet is kept in the teddy bear museum in Newby Hall near Ripon, UK.

===Performers===
Frank Oz first performed Fozzie in 1976 on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. He remained Fozzie&#x27;s main performer until his departure from the cast in 2000. In 2002, Eric Jacobson became Fozzie&#x27;s main performer and has continued to perform the character since then.

Kevin Clash and John Kennedy puppeteered Fozzie for much of the production of &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, respectively, with Oz dubbing Fozzie&#x27;s voice. Victor Yerrid performed Fozzie for a 2006 Disney Cruise Line stage show, &quot;Muppets Ahoy!&quot;. Voice actor Greg Berg provided Fozzie&#x27;s voice for the Saturday morning cartoon &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, as well as its short-lived spin-off, &quot;Little Muppet Monsters&quot;. In the reboot of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, Fozzie is voiced by Eric Bauza.

==Characterization==
===Origins and personality===
Frank Oz has described Fozzie as &quot;desperately insecure&quot; and cites the character&#x27;s close friendship with Kermit the Frog to be essential to his core. Oz elaborated that &quot;with Kermit, he would want to find a way to be funny. That&#x27;s not altruistic for Fozzie. He&#x27;s not trying to make people feel better. He just wants to be a great comedian. But the main thing is that he would need to be with Kermit. He feels alone without Kermit.&quot;

Being best friends, Fozzie and Kermit have frequently been paired together in many movies, books, and specials. In &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, Fozzie is the first Muppet that Kermit meets on his journey. After Fozzie&#x27;s unsuccessful comedy performance at the El Sleezo Cafe, Kermit invited Fozzie to come to Hollywood with him. The two friends sing the duet &quot;Movin&#x27; Right Along&quot; in the film. Several episodes show Fozzie as dedicated to Kermit, usually responding to his instructions with a chipper &quot;Yes sir&quot;. On those rare occasions when Kermit must be away from the theater, he invariably leaves Fozzie in charge of the show, although he equally invariably regrets it (due to the bear&#x27;s lack of skill as a showrunner). In &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, Fozzie and Kermit are portrayed as twin brothers.

Fozzie&#x27;s mother, Emily Bear (performed by Jerry Nelson), appeared in &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; special. To Fozzie&#x27;s surprise, she was friends with Statler and Waldorf, despite the heckling they inflict on him. Fozzie also has a cousin who appeared in the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; as an audience member, also performed by Frank Oz. In one episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, he begged the other audience members not to insult his cousin Fozzie, and has a friend named Jasmine the tortoise. In &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, Fozzie makes reference to his uncle, whose Studebaker he traded in while his uncle was hibernating.

===On &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;===
In the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the show&#x27;s opening featured Fozzie telling a joke during an instrumental portion of the theme song. Fozzie was often featured in a sketch where he did a comedy monologue, in which Statler and Waldorf would heckle him (he was their favorite victim). In the second season, Fozzie&#x27;s comedy routines often had gimmicks such as ventriloquism or performing on roller skates. As the series progressed, he did fewer comedy routines, becoming more involved in the show as a whole. He also performed as a magician occasionally.

Occasionally, Fozzie uses Jewish humor on the show, a nod to Frank Oz&#x27;s Jewish heritage and the Borscht Belt comics that were widely popular in the mid-20th century. For example, &quot;The Telephone Pole Bit&quot; included a reference to Frank Oz&#x27;s Polish Jewish father, and in Fozzie&#x27;s magic act, he pulls a rabbi out of his hat.

Though his main job was to be the show&#x27;s comedian, he has had a number of other roles on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. He sang and danced in many musical numbers, and frequently acted in sketches (most famously his recurring sketch &quot;Bear On Patrol&quot; where he plays an unlucky police officer). He also often helps backstage and even attempts to plan out the show in one episode, and write the script in another.

In one episode, he and his mother Emily do a performance of Knees Up Mother Brown, in which he sings and Emily dances as Mother Brown in the chorus.

In Episode 115, Fozzie constantly annoys Kermit with a running gag, delivering a number of pun items, such as a &quot;wire&quot; and a &quot;letter&quot; for Kermit the Frog which turned out to be a clothes wire and the letter R, respectively.

Another running gag is Fozzie&#x27;s hat—as a bear, he is naturally covered with fur, all over. However, upon removing his hat, it is clear that his head shape is modeled on the pate of a bald headed man—thus, the juxtaposition of being both furred and bald simultaneously. This was referenced in the 2011 film &quot;The Muppets&quot;, where he saw an old picture of himself at the Muppet Theater and ridiculed the &quot;&#x27;80s haircut&quot; he sported back then.

Fozzie was also frequently teamed up with Rowlf the Dog. In Episode 101, Fozzie plays a western bandit to Rowlf&#x27;s role as a western hero. Fozzie also appeared in two &quot;Veterinarian&#x27;s Hospital&quot; sketches, in which Rowlf starred as Dr. Bob.

In Episode 218, Rowlf learns that Fozzie could play the piano, and they play the piano together in a performance of &quot;English Country Garden&quot;. Rowlf has also played back-up to Fozzie&#x27;s renditions of &quot;Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee (An Actor&#x27;s Life for Me)&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Rhythm&quot;. During the latter number, Rowlf attempts to help Fozzie with his singing but is finally reduced to changing the hapless bear&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;I &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; Got Rhythm&quot;. The young incarnations of Fozzie and Rowlf are also frequently paired together on &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;.

<text>Swarthmore College ( , ) is a private liberal arts college in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1864, with its first classes held in 1869, Swarthmore is one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. It was established as a college under the Religious Society of Friends. By 1906, Swarthmore had dropped its religious affiliation and officially became non-sectarian.

Swarthmore is an exclusively undergraduate four-year institution. It is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative academic arrangement with Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College. Swarthmore is also affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania through the Quaker Consortium, which allows students to cross-register for classes at all four institutions.

Swarthmore&#x27;s alumni include six Nobel Prize winners, 13 MacArthur Foundation fellows, as well as winners of the Tony Awards, Grammy Awards, Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, and the Guggenheim Fellowship.

==History==
The name &quot;Swarthmore&quot; has its roots in early Quaker history. In England, Swarthmoor Hall near the town of Ulverston, Cumbria, (previously in Lancashire), was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when George Fox, fresh from his epiphany atop Pendle Hill in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded the couple of his views. Swarthmore was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled &quot;The Quakers&quot;).

The college was founded in 1864 by Deborah Fisher Wharton, along with her industrialist son, Joseph Wharton, together with a committee of members of the Hicksite Yearly Meetings of Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. It is the only college founded by the Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends: previous Quaker institutions, like nearby Haverford College, were Orthodox in their founding history. Swarthmore held its first classes in 1869 and Edward Parrish (1822–1872) was the first president. Lucretia Mott (1793–1880) and Martha Ellicott Tyson (1795–1873) were among those Friends who insisted that the new college of Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years. His daughter, Helen Magill, (1853–1944), was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877, she was the first woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D.

In the early 1900s, the college had a major collegiate American football program during the formation period of the soon-to-be nationwide sport (playing Navy, Princeton, Columbia and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life. The 1921 appointment of Frank Aydelotte as president began the development of the school&#x27;s current academic focus, particularly with his vision for the Honors program based on his experience as a Rhodes Scholar.

During World War II, Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a U.S. Navy commission.

Wolfgang Köhler, Hans Wallach, and Solomon Asch were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left Nazi Germany because of its discriminatory policies. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his noted conformity experiments at Swarthmore.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of new buildings: Sharples Dining Hall in 1964, Worth Health Center in 1965, the Dana/Hallowell Residence Halls in 1967, and Lang Music Building in 1973. They also saw a 1967 review of the college initiated by President Courtney Smith, a black protest movement, in which African-American students conducted an eight-day sit-in in the admissions office in 1969 to demand increased black enrollment – the sit-in abruptly ended after Smith&#x27;s death from a heart attack on January 16 – and the establishment of both a Black Cultural Center (1970) and Women&#x27;s Resource Center (1974). The Environmental Studies program and the Intercultural Center were established in 1992, and in 1993 the Lang Performing Arts Center was opened; the Kohlberg Hall was then established in 1996.

In 1999 the college began purchasing renewable energy credits in the form of wind power, and in the 2002–2003 academic year it constructed its first green roof. In 2008, Swarthmore&#x27;s first mascot, Phineas the Phoenix, made its debut.

In February 2025, the university saw a student-led sit-in at the college&#x27;s Parrish Hall that drew the attention of the FBI under the second Trump administration; during the peaceful demonstration, students pushed for the university to divest its endowment funds from companies linked to Israel.

==Academics==

Swarthmore&#x27;s Oxbridge tutorial-inspired Honors Program, introduced in 1922, allows students to take double-credit seminars from their third year, and they often write honors theses. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three 10-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20–30-page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their final year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded &quot;Highest Honors&quot;; others are either awarded &quot;High Honors&quot; or &quot;Honors&quot;; rarely, a student is denied Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admission to the Honors program.

Uncommon for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an engineering program in which, at the completion of four years&#x27; work, students are granted a B.S. in engineering. Other notable programs include minors in peace and conflict studies, cognitive science and interpretation theory.

Swarthmore has an undergraduate student enrollment of 1,620 (for the 2016–2017 year) and 187 faculty members (99% with a terminal degree), for a student-faculty ratio of 8:1. The small college offers more than 600 courses per year in over 40 courses of study.

Its most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
* Economics (53)
* Biology/Biological Sciences (37)
* Computer &amp; Information Sciences (36)
* Engineering (23)
* Mathematics (18)
* Research &amp; Experimental Psychology (16)

===Rankings===
Some sources, including &quot;Greene&#x27;s Guides&quot;, have termed Swarthmore one of the &quot;Little Ivies&quot;. In its 2025 college ranking, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Swarthmore as the third-best liberal arts college in the nation, behind Williams and Amherst. Since the inception of the &quot;U.S. News&quot; rankings, Amherst, Williams and Swarthmore are the only colleges to have been ranked for the number one liberal arts college. Swarthmore has been ranked the number one liberal arts college in the country six times.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Swarthmore 27th in its 2024-25 ranking of the top 500 U.S. colleges, universities and service academies .

Swarthmore ranked third among all institutions of higher education in the United States as measured by the percentage of graduates who went on to earn Ph.D.s between 2013 and 2022.

In 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013, Swarthmore was named the #1 &quot;Best Value&quot; private college by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;. Overall selection criteria included more than 30 factors in three areas: academics, costs and financial aid. Swarthmore was also placed on &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; Financial Aid Honor Roll along with twelve other institutions for receiving the highest possible rating in its ranking methodology.

===Admissions===
The college is considered by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as &quot;most selective&quot;, with 10.7% of the 9,383 applicants accepted during the 2016–2017 admissions cycle. The number of applicants was the highest in the college&#x27;s history and among the highest overall of any liberal arts college. The college saw increases in the number of underrepresented students, first-generation college students, and international students. The college reports that &quot;Twenty-five percent of the admitted students are among the first generation in their family to attend college&quot; and &quot;Of the admitted students attending high schools reporting class rank, 94 percent are in the top decile&quot;. The class of 2022 admissions statistics have been fully released, where 13,012 applicants resulted in 1013 admits for an admit rate of 7.78%.

In 2012, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; gave Swarthmore a 99 out of 99 on their Admissions Selectivity Rating.

===Graduates===
At Swarthmore, 15% of earners of undergraduate degrees immediately enter graduate or professional school, and, within five years of graduation, 75% of alumni enter these programs. Alumni of the school earn graduate degrees most commonly at institutions that include Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, Princeton University, Brown University, the University of Cambridge, Columbia University and the University of Chicago. At graduate programs, the most common fields for Swarthmore graduates to enter are math &amp; physical sciences, humanities, social sciences, life sciences and engineering.

PayScale reports that Swarthmore graduates have an average starting salary of $70,800 and an average mid-career salary of $142,900, making their salaries the 31st highest among all college and university graduates with only a bachelor&#x27;s. This puts them above larger institutions such as Vanderbilt, Brown and Johns Hopkins—ranked 70th, 33rd and 95th, respectively. Swarthmore is also ninth among liberal arts colleges alone.

== Endowment and tuition fees ==
As a need-blind school, Swarthmore makes admission decisions and financial aid decisions independently. The cost of tuition, student activity fees, room and board for the 2024–25 academic year was $85,802 (tuition fees were $65,058). The college meets 100% of admitted student demonstrated need without use of student loans, an important distinction from the many schools that meet 100% of demonstrated need, but only through loans (which must be repaid) rather than institutional grant- and scholarship-based funding (which does not require repayment). Financial aid is accessed by 56% of the student body, and the average financial aid award was $50,361 during the 2017–18 year.

Swarthmore has the eleventh largest endowment per undergraduate in the country. Operating revenue for the 2016 fiscal year was $148,086,000, over 50% of which was provided by the endowment. Swarthmore ended a $230 million capital campaign on October 6, 2006, when President Bloom declared the project completed, three months ahead of schedule. The campaign, christened the &quot;Meaning of Swarthmore&quot;, had been underway officially since the fall of 2001. Out of the college&#x27;s alumni, 87% participated in the effort. Swarthmore&#x27;s endowment at the end of the 2019 fiscal year was $2.13 billion. Endowment per student was $1,370,157 for the same year, one of the highest rates in the country.

At the end of 2007, the Swarthmore Board of Managers approved the decision for the college to eliminate student loans from all financial aid packages. Instead, additional aid scholarships are granted.

==Campus==

The campus consists of , based on a north–south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses campus radio station WSRN-FM as well as the weekly student newspaper, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

From the SEPTA Swarthmore commuter train station and the borough of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is coterminous with the grounds of the Scott Arboretum, cited by some as a main staple of the campus&#x27;s renowned beauty. In 2011, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; named Swarthmore one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms Willets, Mertz, Worth, The Lodges, Alice Paul and David Kemp. To the west are the dorms Wharton, Dana, Hallowell and Danawell, along with the Scott Amphitheater, an open wooded outdoor amphitheater, in which graduations and college collections (meetings) are held. The Crum Woods extend westward from the main campus, and many buildings on the forest side of the campus incorporate views of the woods. South of Parrish is the Dining Center, attached to the former Sharples dining hall, and other smaller buildings. Dormitories Palmer, Pittenger, Roberts, and the NPPR Apartments are south of the railroad station, as are the athletic facilities, while the Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.

The college has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.

===Friends Historical Library===
Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve and make available archival, manuscript, printed and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present. Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women&#x27;s rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education and business in Britain and America. The library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.

Within the archives is what was formerly known as the Jane Addams Peace Collection and later called the Swarthmore College Peace Collection (SCPC). The SCPC includes papers from Jane Addams&#x27; collection and material from over 59 countries. The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Addams, is part of the collection. The SCPC states that &quot;Well over fifty percent of all the holdings in the Peace Collection concern women&#x27;s activism around the world.&quot; The SCPC was started when Lucy Biddle Lewis, a member of the board of managers, discovered that Addams was burning her old papers, and convinced her to donate them instead to the Friends Historical Library. After World War II, the librarian at Princeton University, Julian P. Boyd, appraised the papers in the SCPC&#x27;s collection and found that they were of &quot;rare historic value&quot;.

==Student life==
One thousand six hundred and forty-seven students (colloquially referred to as &quot;Swatties&quot;) attend Swarthmore . The median family income of Swatties is $165,500, with 53% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 18.2% from the bottom 60%.

===Mock trial===
Founded in 2000, the Swarthmore mock trial team placed tenth at the 2000 American Mock Trial Association (AMTA) National Championship Tournament and was awarded &quot;Best New School&quot;. Dennis Cheng &#x27;01 was awarded the prestigious &quot;Spirit of AMTA&quot; award in 2000. Swarthmore&#x27;s team placed second at the 2001 AMTA National Championship Tournament. The Swarthmore Mock Trial program has also won numerous accolades and boasted a team of over 25 members for the 2013–2014 season. The 2010–2011 competitive season resulted in all three teams competing at Regional Championships, two teams going on to Opening Round Championships, and one team qualifying and competing at the 2011 National Championships held in Des Moines, Iowa, where the team placed 15th in their division. Other successes included placing first at the Philadelphia Regional competition in February 2011, and winning the University of Massachusetts Amherst&#x27;s invitational tournament in February 2014.

===Greek life===
Until 2019, two Greek organizations existed on the campus in the form of fraternities: Delta Upsilon and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. A third, Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, maintained a chapter on campus from 1906 to 1991 and continues strong alumni involvement.

Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system, and leading to a 79-year ban. However, in September 2012, the college announced that the ban on sororities would be reversed as of the 2013 term, citing Title IX regulations. The four women who helped overturn the ban subsequently spearheaded the reestablishment of a Kappa Alpha Theta chapter the following spring. The announcement sparked controversy on campus; a petition seeking a referendum to continue the ban was dismissed, again citing a legal opinion that to disallow the sorority chapter would be a violation of Title IX regulations. The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. A further non-binding referendum was later distributed, but by then the controversy had cooled: Of the six items on the referendum, only one passed, which asked &quot;Do you support admitting students of all genders to sororities and fraternities?&quot; No action was taken on the referendum.

In April 2019, two student publications, &quot;Voices&quot; and &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, published leaked minutes from Swarthmore&#x27;s chapter of Phi Psi dating from 2013 to 2016. The 116-page document contained a plethora of misogynistic, racist, and homophobic jokes and slurs as well as pornographic images and evidence of hazing. Students responded by calling for the college&#x27;s administration to immediately terminate all fraternity leases on campus, staging a sit-in at the Phi Psi house until the demands were met. Both Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi announced their voluntary disbandment on April 30, 2019. President Valerie Smith subsequently announced on May 10, 2019, that Greek letter organizations were no longer allowed at Swarthmore.

==Media==
===&quot;The Swarthmore Phoenix&quot;===

&quot;The Swarthmore Phoenix&quot; has been the independent campus newspaper of Swarthmore College since 1881 or 1882. The phoenix has deep roots in Swarthmore lore. When the college&#x27;s iconic Parrish Hall was gutted by fire in 1881, it was immediately rebuilt, rising, some noted, from the ashes like the bird found in Egyptian and Greek mythology. Thereafter, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; became the name of the campus newspaper.

With an early staff that often numbered fewer than ten people, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; was first published monthly, then moved to a bi-weekly schedule in 1894. It is now published weekly. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; first appeared online in September 1995. The newspaper is printed by Hocking News in Lancaster County.

===&quot;Voices&quot; (and &quot;The Daily Gazette&quot;)===
&quot;Voices&quot; was founded in 2017 as &quot;an online news publication solely dedicated to centering marginalized voices and creating space for them to tell their own stories&quot;, in response to controversial articles about African-American protests in the already-existing online publication &quot;The Daily Gazette&quot;. In May 2018, &quot;The Daily Gazette&quot;, which had been published since 1996, merged with &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

===Magazines===

There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published semi-annually at the end of each semester.

One is &quot;Spike&quot;, Swarthmore&#x27;s humor magazine, founded in 1993. The others are literary magazines, including &quot;Nacht&quot;, which publishes long-form non-fiction, fiction, poetry and artwork; &quot;Small Craft Warnings&quot;, which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; &quot;Scarlet Letters&quot;, which publishes women&#x27;s literature; &quot;Enie&quot;, for Spanish literature; &quot;Visibility Zine&quot;, for literature and art by historically marginalized groups; &quot;OURstory&quot;, for literature relating to diversity issues; &quot;Bug-Eyed Magazine&quot;, a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature (SWIL); &quot;Remappings&quot; (formerly &quot;CelebrASIAN&quot;), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; &quot;Alchemy&quot;, a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; &quot;Mjumbe&quot;, published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An erotica magazine, &quot;!&quot; (pronounced &quot;bang&quot;) was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, &quot;Untouchables&quot;. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a photography magazine, &quot;Pun/ctum&quot;, which features work from students and alumni.

===Radio station===
WSRN 91.5 FM is the college radio station. It has a mix of indie, rock, hip-hop, electronic dance, folk, world, jazz and classical music, as well as a number of radio talk shows. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the 1969 black protest movement extensively. In the 1990s, WSRN centered its programming on the immensely popular &quot;Hank and Bernie Show&quot;, starring undergraduates Hank Hanks and Bernie Bernstein. Hank and Bernie conducted wide-ranging and entertaining interviews of sports stars and cultural icons such as Lou Piniella, Mark Grace, Jake Plummer, Greg Ostertag, Andy Karich and Mark &quot;the Bird&quot; Fidrych, and also engaged the Swarthmore community in discussions on campus issues and current events. Upwards of 90 percent of the Swarthmore community would tune in to the Hank and Bernie Show and many members of the surrounding villages and towns would also listen and call in. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival. Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000 and the effects of the September 11 attacks on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN&#x27;s lineup is &quot;Oído al Tambor&quot;, which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show&#x27;s concept was revived by the show &quot;Rayuela&quot;, which has been running since September 2009.
==Societies and groups==
===A cappella===
The collegiate a cappella groups include Sixteen Feet, the college&#x27;s oldest group (founded in 1981), as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group (founded in 1983), and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Essence of Soul is the college&#x27;s all-black group. The youngest group, OffBeat was founded in the fall of 2013 as a group open to all genders and identities. In addition, Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the Tri-College Consortium and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. The groups, self-run as volunteer clubs with college support, travel to other schools to participate in concerts. Once every semester, all of the school&#x27;s a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree, which includes visiting groups from other colleges and universities.

===Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association===
Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year. A fire horn, colloquially deemed the &quot;fire moose&quot;, is located within the Swarthmore campus and its sound has become a fixture of campus life.

===Swarthmore College Computer Society===
Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run volunteer organization independent of the official ITS department of the college. SCCS operates a set of servers that provide web applications for the Swarthmore College community, e-mail accounts, Unix shell login accounts, server storage space and webspace to students, professors, alumni and other student-run organizations. SCCS hosts over 100 mailing lists used by various student groups, and over 130 organizational websites. SCCS also provides a computer lab and gaming room, located in Clothier basement beneath Essie Mae&#x27;s snack bar.

====Impact====
In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a slashdotting while hosting a copy of the Diebold memos on behalf of the student group Free Culture Swarthmore, then known as the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant DMCA takedown request received by the college&#x27;s ITS department.

SCCS was noted in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; article &quot;Top 20 Wired Colleges&quot; as one of the reasons for ranking Swarthmore #4 on that list.

Three SCCS-related papers have been accepted for publication at the USENIX Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference, one of which was awarded Best Paper.

==Athletics==
Swarthmore&#x27;s athletic department has 22 varsity intercollegiate sports teams including badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The football team was controversially eliminated in 2000, along with wrestling and, initially, badminton. The Board of Managers cited lack of athletes on campus and difficulty of recruiting as reasons for terminating the programs.

The department also offers a number of club sport options, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, fencing and squash. The participation rate of students in intercollegiate or club sports is 40 percent.

Swarthmore is a charter member of the Centennial Conference, a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland and is a member of NCAA Division III.

The men&#x27;s basketball team is currently coached by Landry Kosmalski who was named Division III&#x27;s National Coach of the Year in 2020. In the 2018–19 season, the Garnet reached the NCAA Division III Championship Game for the first time but lost to the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh 96–82. The 2019–20 team began the season 26–0 and were the last unbeaten team remaining out of all of Division I, II and III. The Garnet were ranked No. 1 in the nation by D3hoops.com for the entirety of the season, becoming the first team to be ranked at the top of that poll from start to finish.

Swarthmore has won 26 Centennial Conference team championships and claims four national championships in men&#x27;s lacrosse in 1900, 1904, 1905 and 1910, four national championships in men&#x27;s tennis in 1977, 1981, 1985 and 1990, two men&#x27;s tennis doubles national championships in 1976 and 1985, and two individual championships in women&#x27;s track and field in 2016 and 2023.

<doc id="145249" wikidata="Q159835" url="?curid=145249" title="Batman, Turkey">
<text>Batman () is a city and capital of Batman District in Batman Province, Turkey. It lies on a plateau, above sea level, near the confluence of the Batman River and the Tigris and had a population of 452,157 in 2021. It is populated by Kurds.

The Batı Raman oil field, which is the largest oil field in Turkey, is located just outside the city. Batman has a local airport and a military airbase, which was used for transit of aircraft and helicopters in some search and rescue operations during the Gulf War.

Until the 1950s, Batman was a village, with a population of about 3,000. However, oil fields were discovered around it in the 1940s that resulted in a rapid development of the area and in the inflow of workforce from other parts of Turkey. In 1957, the village was renamed Batman, after the river namesake, received a city status and became a district center. Over the next 50 years, a significant amount of Batman&#x27;s one-story buildings were rebuilt as multi-story buildings. As a result, its population grew to many times its previous size. A km long oil pipeline was built in 1967 from Batman to the port city of Dörtyol near the easternmost point of the Mediterranean coast in order to transport the crude oil from the Batman refinery. In 1990, the city became the capital of Batman Province.

Apart from oil, which is by far the dominant commodity of the region, Batman produces beverages, processed food, chemicals, furniture, footwear, machinery and transport equipment. A university was established in 2007, Batman University, and is part of the Erasmus foreign student exchange program.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The Batman Province contains the strategic Tigris River with fertile lands by its sides, as well as rocky hills with numerous caves providing a natural shelter. As a result, it was inhabited from prehistoric times, likely from the Neolithic (Paleolithic) period, according to archeological evidence. First documented evidence of settlements in the province dates back to the 7th century BC. An artificial &quot;island&quot; was created in this marshy area, which was named &quot;elekhan&quot; and stood independent for 194 years from 546 BC until the invasion of Alexander the Great in 352 BC. The Batman Province was a religious center in the 4th–6th centuries AD and was part of the Byzantine Empire for seven centuries. In the 11th–12th centuries became under the control of the Great Seljuq Empire and Artuqids and became a prominent outpost of the Silk Road. This area was populated by Syriac Christians and had a significant presence of Pontic Greeks, Assyrians, Baghdadi Jews and Armenians; these peoples lived in the region from 500 BC to the late 19th century. Significant changes in its management and language were brought in 1515 by Mahmoud Pasha Elekhani. It is believed that a variant of his name, &quot;Elah&quot;, was transformed into &quot;Iluh&quot; and gave the old name to the Batman city.

=== During Sayfo ===
During Sayfo a resistance mounted by the Assyrian population in the city of Batman, facing relentless persecution and violence at the hands of Kurdish tribes, employing guerrilla tactics and utilizing their intimate knowledge of the city&#x27;s streets and alleyways, the defenders of Batman fought, and resist the forces of Kurds but the defense of Batman was ultimately suppressed.

=== Modern history ===

The locality was made the capital of a district in the Siirt Province in 1957 and as the Batman province was founded in May 1990, also its capital. The city was connected with Istanbul in 1944 by a railway line. This was the major transportation route until the 1950s when highways gradually became more important. Until the 1950s, Batman was a village of some 3,000 people; it was called Iluh and belonged to the Siirt Province. It was first located in the Elmedin district of Siirt. The entire district disappeared in the early 1926 due to the flood of the Batman River. After that, Iluh became part of Beşiri sub-province. On 2 September 1957, the village became a district center and renamed Batman after the river flowing nearby, which was known under its modern name since at least the 19th century. On 16 May 1990, it was designated the capital of the Batman Province.

This administrative evolution reflected the rapid growth of the city owing to its oil extraction and refinement industries. Oil was found in the region in the 1930s and the oldest in Turkey refinery was built in 1955 to process crude oil of the Raman and Garzan areas. The refinery is operated by Tüpraş, it has a processing capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per year and storage capacity of 253 billion m3 (330,000 million cubic yards).

Development of the oil fields outside the city resulted in a rapid growth of Batman beginning in the 1950s. As a result, the city was declared a &quot;Priority Region for Development&quot;. A high school was established in the city in 1975 and most one-story houses were rebuilt into multi-story buildings. However, the large inflow of labor for the oil industry resulted in construction of hundreds of unauthorized small buildings on the outskirts of the city. Because of the wind direction, most industrial complexes were located in the southern and south-eastern areas.

== Kurdish–Turkish conflict ==
The oil-related development of Batman also resulted in relocation of Turkish people into a mostly Kurd-populated Batman Province. This has brought ethnic conflicts that escalated in the 1990s. More than 180 civilians were killed in the Batman city area by unidentified gunmen between 1992 and 1993. In June 2000, the then-Mayor Abdullah Akın attempted to rename up to 200 streets, and give them names of events of the Kurdish history or of people who supported the Kurdish culture. A Turkish court did not allow some names, but other names passed. In 2010, the city was the location for the first Kurdish film festival in Turkey. In the opening ceremony a letter of the imprisoned mayor Nejdet Atalay was read out in the Kurdish language highlighting the struggles the Kurds have to go through in Turkey that does not recognize the Kurdish language.

==Politics==
In the local elections in December 1977, a candidate who openly supported Kurdish rights, Edip Sönmez, won the elections. He was murdered in 1979. The Kurdish Mayors Abdullah Akın (1999–2002), Hüseyin Kalkan (2002–2009) and Nejdet Atalay have all faced prosecutions and were in prison. The former mayor of Batman Nejdet Atalay, was a member of the Democratic Society Party (DTP) until the Constitutional Court of Turkey banned that party on 11 December 2009 for alleged ties to the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party. This decision banned him and 35 other members of the now-disbanded political party from joining any political party for five years. In 2014 Sabri Özdemir won the elections. But he was suspended as mayor in October 2015 for &quot;Self governance&quot; remarks and later dismissed.

In the local elections of March 2019, Mehmet Demir was elected Mayor of Batman, but on 23 February 2020, he was dismissed and a trustee was appointed. Kaymakam is Osman Bilici.

==Demographics==
According to the national census data collected between 1990 and 2000, the population of Batman is growing at a rate of 5% per year. By 2008, it reached a population of 298,342, with a male to female ratio of 1.015. According to the 2000 census, about 50% of population is married and has about 5 children per family. About 5 people are living together in one house as family. The unemployment rate is about 20% for males and 10% for females. Kurdish is the main first-language in the city.

==Industry==
Batman&#x27;s primary commodity is oil, as there are multiple oil fields in the nearby area. These oil fields have spurred the creation of multiple pipelines to transmit oil to and from several important cities. Apart from oil, which is by far the dominant commodity of the region, Batman produces beverages, processed food, chemicals, furniture, footwear, machinery and transport equipment.

=== Oil fields ===
Search for oil in the Batman Province started in 1935. On 20 April 1940, oil was found at a depth of at the Raman oil field, located south-east of Batman. The first experimental well began producing 10 tonnes (about ) of oil per day on 6 June 1940. The field was set to be expanded for commercial production by 1945, but the production was delayed to 1947 due to the lack of storage. To solve this, a small refinery was built at the site with a capacity of 9 tonnes/day in 1947, and in November 1948 a bigger refinery capable of processing up to 200 tonnes/day was completed in Batman. An even bigger refinery (330 tonnes/d) was completed in Batman in 1955. Several other oil fields were discovered later around Batman, the largest being Batı Raman oil field, which produces about of oil daily.

=== Pipelines ===
A km long oil pipeline was built in 1967 from Batman to Dörtyol, a port city located near the easternmost point of the Mediterranean coast, to transport the crude oil from the Batman region. The pipeline has an annual capacity of 3.5 million tonnes and was transporting about (about 2.7 million tonnes) in the 1990s and about twice less between 2003 and 2007. Another, short pipeline long connected Batman with Şelmo, which is the location of the second largest oil field in Turkey. It transferred between 1.5 and of oil per year between the years of 1990 and 2007. Both pipelines are operated by BOTAŞ.

==Education and sports==

=== Education ===
According to the census of 2000, 15% males and 43% females of Batman were categorized as illiterate. Within the literate part, about 33% males and 29% females have not finished secondary school, 3.3% males and 0.9% females had university education, and about 13% males and 3.8% females had completed a high-school or an equivalent program. There are 71 elementary and 12 high schools in Batman.

==== Batman University ====
The city also has a university, Batman University, which was founded on 27 May 2007. It employs about 140 staff members and has the faculties of Science and Letters, Technical Education, and Engineering, which mostly cover topics about engineering, business, and administration. About 2,500 students, who come from different parts of Turkey, study at the university. The university is part of the Erasmus foreign student exchange program.

=== Sports ===
Association football is the most popular sport in Batman. The city has a professional football club, Batman Petrolspor, which was formed in 1960 and plays in the third division TFF Third League. The club was named after the petroleum industry of the city. Another local football team, 72 Batmanspor, participates in the Amateur League. There is a football stadium in Batman, which has a seating capacity of 4,900 spectators.

Another popular sport is wrestling. Freestyle wrestlers from Batman have won national competitions, and Ali Riza Alan won gold in 1970 and silver in 1974 in world championships in the weight category under . The major sport venue of Batman, Atatürk Sports Hall, can accommodate 1,000 spectators and supports many athletics, such as badminton, basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, folk dance, handball, martial arts (such as kurash, judo, aikido, wushu, karate and taekwondo), table tennis, volleyball and swimming.

==Transportation==
Batman is connected by highways and railway with the nearby cities of Diyarbakır and Kurtalan and with the capital Ankara. The distance (using highways) to Istanbul is , to Ankara , and to İzmir . There is also a regional airport outside of Batman at , which provides direct flights to İzmir, Ankara and Istanbul. The airport is combined with the military Batman Air Base. The base was renovated after the US-Turkey agreement in 1982 to make the base available for US tactical aircraft acting within NATO forces. This allowed them to patrol the region of Caucasus, Turkey and Iran without refueling. The base was then used for aid delivery and rescue missions in Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.

==Geography==

Batman is built on a flat plateau elevated at above the sea level, though there is a declining slope of up to 0.6° in the northeastern and southern areas. There are almost no forests in and around the city. The Iluh River, a tributary of the Batman River, flows through the city. The soil mostly consists of soft and porous clay; it is unstable and is easily eroded with rain and floods of the Batman and Iluh rivers. The floods usually occur between March and May, although they sometimes occur between October and November. Major floods occurred in 1969 (April, 60 buildings damaged), 1972 (April and May, 210 buildings damaged), 1991 (November, 500 buildings flooded), 1995 (March, nearly 1000 buildings submerged and 450 damaged) and 2006 (October, 11 people died and 20 injured).

== Climate ==
Batman has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cs&quot;). Summers in the city are, on average, one of the hottest in the nation, averaging in July. Rainfall is almost non-existent during the summer months, with many summer months passing by without measurable precipitation. Winters are cool and wet with frosty nights. Snowfall is sporadic between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, with a record snow depth of .

<text>A batman or orderly is a soldier or airman assigned to a commissioned officer as a personal servant. Before the advent of motorized transport, an officer&#x27;s batman was also in charge of the officer&#x27;s &quot;bat-horse&quot; that carried the officer&#x27;s kit during a campaign. This British English term is derived from the obsolete &quot;bat&quot;, meaning &quot;pack saddle&quot; (from French &quot;bât&quot;, from Old French &quot;bast&quot;, from Late Latin &quot;bastum&quot;).

== Duties ==

A batman&#x27;s duties could include:

* acting as a &quot;runner&quot; to convey orders from the officer to subordinates
* maintaining the officer&#x27;s uniform and personal equipment as a valet
* driving the officer&#x27;s vehicle, sometimes under combat conditions
* acting as the officer&#x27;s bodyguard in combat
* digging the officer&#x27;s foxhole in combat, giving the officer time to direct his unit
* other miscellaneous tasks the officer does not have time or inclination to do

The action of serving as a batman was called &quot;batting&quot;. In armies where officers typically came from the upper class, it was not unusual for a former batman to follow the officer into later civilian life as a domestic servant.

== By country ==
=== France ===

In the French Army the term for batman was &quot;ordonnance&quot; (&quot;orderly&quot;). Batmen were officially abolished after World War II. However, in the 1960s there were still batmen in the French Army.

=== Germany ===
In the German Army the batman was known as &quot;Ordonnanz&quot; (&quot;orderly&quot;) from the French &quot;ordonnance&quot;, or colloquially as &quot;Putzer&quot; (&quot;cleaner&quot;) or as &quot;Bursche&quot; (&quot;boy&quot; or &quot;valet&quot;).

The main character Švejk of the antimilitarist, satirical novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; by the Czech author Jaroslav Hašek is the most famous portrayal of a batman drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. (The 1967 German song &quot;Ich war der Putzer vom Kaiser&quot; is actually based on the British instrumental hit &quot;I Was Kaiser Bill&#x27;s Batman&quot; of the same year, with original German lyrics.)

=== India ===
The old British term &quot;orderly&quot; continued into the post-independence Indian Army. It has now, however, been replaced with the Hindi word &quot;sahayak&quot;, which translates as &quot;assistant&quot; or &quot;helper&quot;. There have been suggestions to do away with the practice, as the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force already have.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh Army, officers and officer cadets have civilian orderlies. In Bangladesh Air Force, they are called batmen.

=== Italy ===
In the Italian Army the term for batman was &quot;attendente&quot;, from the Italian verb &quot;attendere&quot; (same meaning of the English verb &quot;to attend&quot;). &quot;Attendenti&quot; were eventually abolished in 1971.

=== Nigeria ===
The term &quot;Orderly&quot; is in use for both the military and police assistants.

=== Pakistan ===
The term &quot;batman&quot; in the Pakistan Army dates from the period of the British Indian Army. In the modern Pakistan Army, civilian personnel are employed in this role and are designated as NCB (Non-Combatant Bearer) or (Non-Commissioned Batman). The term implies that the present-day batman is not a soldier or part of the fighting cadre of the army, and works only as a personal servant to each officer.

The employment of NCBs in the Pakistan Air Force and the Pakistan Navy is not officially recognized. However, both these services pay their officers an extra allowance comparable to the average pay of a household servant.

=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===
The Imperial Russian Army used the term &quot;denshchik&quot; () for a batman. In the Russian Empire higher-ranking cavalry officers often chose Cossacks for these roles as they could be reasonably depended on to survive combat, and were also known for resourcefulness on campaign. However, they were hired help, and had to be provided with a horse also. The lower-ranking officers from serf-owning families brought a servant from home they were familiar with, particularly the infantry and artillery officers that did not require additional protection in combat, and tended to leave the servants with the unit baggage train. After the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire (1861), many officers went on campaign without servants.

Although the positions were abolished in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, the recognition that higher-ranking officers required assistance soon fostered an unofficial reintroduction of the role through secondment of an NCO to the officer&#x27;s staff, usually also as the driver, which also at one stage became their unofficial role and title as many officers often &quot;lived&quot; out of their vehicles. The term was borrowed from the French, but adopted to Russian pronunciation as &quot;ordinarets&quot; ().

Several &quot;ordirnartsy&quot; of the marshals and generals commanding fronts and armies during the Second World War wrote memoirs about their service. For example, Zhukov&#x27;s &quot;driver&quot; was a semi-professional racing car driver Aleksandr Nikolaevich Buchin who met Zhukov by accident on the first day of the war when Zhukov&#x27;s previous elderly driver failed to get the vehicle he was in out of the rut. Buchin drove Zhukov throughout the war and although he began the war as a private, he ended the war with the rank of captain. Buchin wrote his memoirs called &quot;One hundred and seventy thousand kilometres with Zhukov&quot;, at the suggestion of the marshal in the 1970s.

=== Sweden ===
&quot;Kalfaktor&quot;, derived from calefactory and entering the Swedish language during the 17th century, was a soldier assigned to tend to an officer from the rank of platoon leader and higher. The duties was mainly focused on practicalities like maintaining the officer&#x27;s personal equipment and uniform, make sure meals and sleeping quarters are prepared and so forth, but also to remind the officer to get rest when needed and to avoid unnecessary risks.

=== Turkey ===
The term &quot;emir eri&quot; (literally &quot;order private&quot;) was used for a soldier that attends an officer. The practice was abolished in 1950.

=== United Kingdom ===

The official term used by the British Army in the First World War was &quot;soldier-servant&quot;. Every officer was assigned a servant, usually chosen by the officer from among his men. The term &quot;batman&quot; replaced this in the inter-war years. Batmen were among the casualties of the Great Depression, and by the Second World War only senior officers of the army and Royal Air Force were officially assigned batmen, with junior officers usually sharing the services of one batman among several officers. However, for infantry officers at the platoon and company levels, many of the batman&#x27;s operational duties were still carried out by a designated runner taken from elsewhere in the formation, though without the prestige and privileges that the role previously held. Batwomen also served in the women&#x27;s services.

Batman was usually seen as a desirable position. The soldier was exempted from more onerous duties and often got better rations and other favours from his officer. Senior officers&#x27; batmen usually received fast promotion to lance-corporal, with many becoming corporals and even sergeants. The position was generally phased out after the war. Officers of the Household Division, however, still have orderlies, because of the high proportion of ceremonial duties required of them.

In the Royal Navy, stewards performed many of the duties of batmen in the other services. Aboard ship, only captains and admirals were assigned personal stewards, with the other officers being served by a pool of officers&#x27; stewards. Most vessels carried at least two stewards, with larger vessels carrying considerably more.

The Royal Marines used the term Marine Officer&#x27;s Attendant (MOA).

The term &quot;orderly&quot; was often used instead of &quot;batman&quot; in the colonial forces, especially in the British Indian Army. The orderly was frequently a civilian instead of a soldier. However, from 1903 to 1939 four Indian officers from different regiments were appointed each year to serve as &quot;King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Indian Orderly Officers&quot; in attendance on the monarch in London. While performing some routine orderly functions the main role of these officers was to represent the Indian Army in full dress uniform at ceremonial functions in front of the British public who might otherwise seldom be made aware of its existence.

In the British Armed Forces, the term &quot;batman&quot; or &quot;batwoman&quot; was formerly also applied to a civilian who cleaned officers&#x27; messes or married quarters. In the Royal Air Force, free married quarters cleaning services were phased out for all officers except squadron leaders or above in command appointments as of 1 April 1972.

One famous example of officer and batman during the Second World War was British actor David Niven and fellow actor Peter Ustinov. Niven and Ustinov were working on the film &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;, as actor and writer, respectively, but the difference in their ranks—Niven was a Lieutenant-Colonel and Ustinov a private—made their association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven&#x27;s batman.

At the start of the Battle of Gazala in the Second World War, Major General Frank Messervy was captured by the Germans on 27 May 1942, but having removed all insignia, managed to bluff the Germans into believing he was a batman. As such, he was not closely guarded by his captors and managed to escape with other members of his staff to rejoin Division HQ the following day.

=== United States ===
Aides are junior commissioned officers who are available to support some of the needs of general officers who serve in command positions in the rank of brigadier general and above, and those of Flag Officers in the grade of Rear Admiral (lower half) and above in the Navy and Coast Guard. These aides &quot;perform tasks and details that, if performed by general or flag officers, would be at the expense of the officer’s primary military and official duties.&quot; Their assistance, however, is restricted to those tasks which are directly related to the officer&#x27;s official duties.

In addition to officers being assigned as aides de camp, all the US Services, including the US Coast Guard, also use enlisted personnel in support of General Officers and Flag Officers. This program is officially known as the Enlisted Aide Program. Generally the personnel are military cooks; however, in recent years, any enlisted person could volunteer to serve in this position. They attend a joint service course for Enlisted Aides and advanced culinary course for cooks. Many are often sent on to education outside the military to become chefs and butler training. Some will also be used as stewards and stewardess on very senior officer aircraft. In addition General and Flag officers are assigned a driver. Drivers may get additional training but not always in driving, taking their service&#x27;s or another service&#x27;s driver course and or other government agency&#x27;s driving schools. Only personnel in the Enlisted Aide Program can serve as an Enlisted Aide. Drivers, admin personnel and others on the personal staff are often but not always selected locally.

Ordinarily, enlisted service members would be prohibited from performing services as an aide. &quot;No officer may use an enlisted member as a servant for duties that contribute only to the officer&#x27;s personal benefit and that have no reasonable connection with the officer&#x27;s official responsibilities, according to the Department of Defense instruction 1315.09 for Enlisted Aides.

In the United States Army the term &quot;striker&quot; or &quot;dog robber&quot; (a slang term implying that the soldier ate table scraps otherwise given to the officer&#x27;s pet dog) was unofficially used, although that could also be applied to a junior officer who acted as a gofer to somebody with high rank. The actor James Garner played such a role in the film &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964).

== Fiction ==

In Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s novel &quot;Whose Body?&quot; (1923) and subsequent novels, Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s valet Mervyn Bunter was also his batman during World War I. 

In the novella &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1933), Mr. Chipping&#x27;s former student, Peter Colley, is killed during the Great War attempting to save the life of his batman and childhood antagonist-cum-friend, Perkins.

Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s &quot;Good Soldier Švejk&quot; begins his WWI military career as a batman to army chaplain Otto Katz; Katz loses him at cards to Senior Lieutenant Lukáš, whose batman he then becomes.

In DC Comics media, Alfred Pennyworth (Batman&#x27;s butler, created in 1943) has been referred to multiple times as &quot;Batman&#x27;s batman.&quot; Currently unsubstantiated rumors have it that Alfred was also Thomas Wayne&#x27;s (Bruce Wayne&#x27;s late father) batman when both men were in military service.

In the &quot;Eagle&quot; comic strip &quot;Dan Dare&quot; (first published in 1950), Digby is Dan&#x27;s batman.

J. R. R. Tolkien took the relationship of his characters Samwise Gamgee and Frodo Baggins (introduced in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in 1954) from his observations while in military service during World War I of the relationship between a batman and his officer.

In 1967, the pseudonymous Whistling Jack Smith (actually a session vocalist) recorded an all-whistling number called &quot;I Was Kaiser Bill&#x27;s Batman&quot;, which went Top 5 in the UK. Despite a title that baffled most Americans (who no doubt were thinking of the other Batman), the tune hit number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

In the musical film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), Caractacus Potts&#x27;s father was Lord Scrumptious&#x27;s batman.

In the BBC sitcom &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; (1989), set during World War I, actor Tony Robinson portrays Private S. Baldrick, the bumbling and incompetent batman to Captain Edmund Blackadder. In the earlier series, taking place between the 1400s and the early 1800s, he plays Edmund Blackadder&#x27;s dogsbody Baldrick, a similar, non-military role.

In the &quot;Honor Bound&quot; book series (1993–2012), the character of Sergeant Major Enrico Rodriguez served in this capacity to Cletus Frade&#x27;s father.

In the television show &quot;Archer&quot; (created in 2009), the eponymous character&#x27;s valet, Woodhouse, was the batman of his superior officer in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War.

In the television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2010–2015), Lord Grantham&#x27;s valet, Mr Bates, was his batman in the Boer War; it also appears that William Mason was assigned to be Matthew Crawley&#x27;s batman in the First World War.

In the television series 
&quot;Blunt Talk&quot; (2015–2016), Adrian Scarborough played Harry Chandler, Falklands War veteran and former Royal Marines lance corporal turned Walter&#x27;s valet.

In the 2012 novel &quot;Cold Days&quot; by Jim Butcher, the lead character, Harry Dresden is assigned a batman, and initially both Harry and Cat Sith are very unhappy with this assignment.

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;, the main character serves as batman to her lieutenant.

Frank Herbert’s 1984 novel &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Patrin, the aide of Miles Teg, is referred to as the Bashar’s Batman.

In the Hungarian movie Taxidermia (2006) Vendel Morosgoványi serves as a batman condemned to performing menial duties for the officer and his family while sleeping in an unheated shack next to the latrines. He frequently escapes into fantasy. So realistic are these fantasies that in one ambiguous instance, Morosgoványi sleeps with and impregnates the lieutenant&#x27;s wife and &quot;wakes up&quot; to find himself engaged in an act of sodomy with a slaughtered pig.

The film Journey&#x27;s End, and the 1928 stage play, are largely concerned with the comings and goings of the officers of a Company on the line in France. A small cadre of servants also housed in the officers&#x27; dugout have numerous lines, and their operations and especially the interactions with the officers are seen in some detail. The most senior of these soldier-servants, and the cook for all the officers is played in the 2017 film by Toby Jones.

In the novel Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, the batman of a Colonel, now serving him as a butler, helps fill up the radiator of Mr. Stevens car with water.

In the Vorkosigan Saga books, most notably Shards of Honour, Barrayar and Mirror Dance by Lois McMaster Bujold the use of a Batman is mentioned several times, in Shards of Honour Bothari is formerly Vorrutyers batman and in Mirror Dance Mark Vorkosigan while pretending to be his identical brother several times is offered by another character who is delivering his equipment to be his batman.

<doc id="145252" wikidata="Q6633142" url="?curid=145252" title="List of people on the postage stamps of the United States">
<text>This article lists people who have been featured on United States postage stamps, listed by their name, the year they were first featured on a stamp, and a short description of their notability. Since the United States Post Office (now United States Postal Service or USPS) issued its first stamp in 1847, over 4,000 stamps have been issued and over 800 people featured. People have been featured on multiple stamps in one issue, or over time, such as various Presidents of the United States. Through the years, a person has had to be deceased before their face appeared on a stamp, though the USPS will document that a stamp has commemorated people, living or deceased, without including their actual face on the stampsuch as the image of a yellow submarine from the 1969 eponymous album cover shown on the 1999 stamp commemorating four people (three then-still alive) who collectively formed The Beatles.

For the purpose of this list, &quot;featured&quot; may mean:
# The likeness of a person,
# The name of a person, or
# People who have neither their likeness nor name on a stamp, but are documented by the United States Postal Service as being the subject of a stamp (see Reference).

<text>The Batman River is a major tributary of the Tigris in southeast Turkey. The region along the Batman River is known for its oil fields.

== Course ==
The river originates in Turkey&#x27;s Anti-Taurus Mountains (at the Sason and Genç mountains) and flows approximately from north to south, passing near the city of Batman and forming a natural border between the Batman Province and Diyarbakır Province. The historic Malabadi Bridge (built in 1146–1147) crosses the river near the town of Silvan.

The river is widest at about right after exiting the dam, but then narrows to about and forms numerous splits along its way to the Tigris. Its riverbed is irregular in many places, promoting flooding. A tributary of Batman, the Iluh River, originates in the Raman Mountain on the south of the Batman city and flows north-west through the city into the Batman River. Despite being a small river, absent on most maps, Iluh plays an important role for the province because its spring floods affect the provincial capital. The floods of Iluh and Batman rivers occur between March and May and sometimes in October or November. Major floods occurred in 1969 (April, 60 buildings damaged), 1972 (April and May, 210 buildings damaged), 1991 (November, 500 buildings flooded), 1995 (March, nearly 1000 buildings submerged and 450 damaged) and 2006 (October, 11 people died and 20 injured).

== Name ==
In Antiquity, the Batman River was known as &quot;Kalat&quot;. This name meant &quot;bride&quot; to the Syriac people who populated the area, and was translated into Greek as &quot;Nymphios&quot; (Νυμφίος, Latinized &quot;Nymphius&quot;) and &quot;Nymphaios&quot; (Νυμφαῖος, Latinized &quot;Nymphaeus&quot;). Among Arabs it was known as &quot;Satidama&quot;, meaning &quot;the bloody&quot; reflecting the battles fought near it. 

In international literature, the name Batman came into use in the 19th century, whereas in the 18th century and before it was mostly referred to as Nymphius, among other names. The origin of the name &quot;Batman&quot; is unclear: it might be a shortening of the name of the tall Bati Raman mountain located nearby or refer to the unit of weight used in the Ottoman Empire.

== History ==
The river served as a natural border between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia and saw major battles in 583 and 591 AD. The main citadel on the river was Martyropolis, modern-day Silvan.

The Batman Dam (, B. de Batman on the map) was built in 1999 in the upstream (), together with the associated reservoir and hydroelectric power plant.

== Wildlife ==
The Batman River loach (&quot;Paraschistura chrysicristinae&quot;) is a critically endangered fish native to the Batman and Ambar rivers. The fish is endangered by drought, habitat destruction, and habitat fragmentation from construction of the Batman Dam. It had not been observed since 1974 and was feared to be extinct until a 2021 expedition netted 14 fish living above the Batman Dam.

<text>György Sándor Ligeti (; ; 28 May 1923 – 12 June 2006) was a Hungarian-Austrian composer of contemporary classical music. He has been described as &quot;one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century&quot; and &quot;one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time&quot;.

Born in Romania, he lived in the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic before emigrating to Austria in 1956. He became an Austrian citizen in 1968. In 1973 he became professor of composition at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg, where he worked until retiring in 1989. His students included Hans Abrahamsen, Unsuk Chin and Michael Daugherty. He died in Vienna in 2006.

Restricted in his musical style by the authorities of Communist Hungary, only when he reached the West in 1956 could Ligeti fully realise his passion for avant-garde music and develop new compositional techniques. After experimenting with electronic music in Cologne, Germany, his breakthrough came with orchestral works such as &quot;Atmosphères&quot;, for which he used a technique he later dubbed micropolyphony. After writing his &quot;anti-anti-opera&quot; &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;, Ligeti shifted away from chromaticism and towards polyrhythm for his later works.

He is best known by the public through the use of his music in film soundtracks. Although he did not directly compose any film scores, excerpts of pieces composed by him were taken and adapted for film use. The sound design of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s films, particularly the music of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, drew from Ligeti&#x27;s work.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ligeti was born in 1923 at Diciosânmartin (&quot;Dicsőszentmárton&quot;; renamed to Târnăveni in 1941) in Romania, to Dr. Sándor Ligeti and Dr. Ilona Somogyi. His family was Hungarian Jewish. He was the great-grandnephew of violinist Leopold Auer and second cousin of Hungarian philosopher Ágnes Heller. Some sources say he was Auer&#x27;s grandnephew, rather than great-grandnephew.

Ligeti recalled that his first exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation between Romanian-speaking town police. Before that, he didn&#x27;t know that other languages existed. He moved to Cluj with his family when he was six years old. He did not return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, Northern Transylvania became part of Hungary following the Second Vienna Award, thus Cluj became part of Hungary as well.

In 1941 Ligeti received his initial musical training at the conservatory in Kolozsvár (Cluj), and during the summers privately with Pál Kadosa in Budapest. In 1944, Ligeti&#x27;s education was interrupted when he was sent to a forced labor brigade by the Horthy regime during events of the Holocaust. His brother Gábor, age 16, was deported to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and both of his parents were sent to Auschwitz. His mother was the only person to survive in his immediate family.

Following World War II, Ligeti returned to his studies in Budapest, graduating in 1949 from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. He studied under Pál Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas, Zoltán Kodály and Sándor Veress. He conducted ethnomusicological research into the Hungarian folk music of Transylvania. However, after a year he returned to Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, this time as a teacher of harmony, counterpoint, and musical analysis. He secured this position with the help of Kodály and held it from 1950 to 1956. As a young teacher, Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending the lectures of an older colleague, the conductor, and musicologist Lajos Bárdos, a conservative Christian whose circle represented a safe haven for Ligeti. The composer acknowledged Bárdos&#x27;s help and advice in the prefaces to his two harmony textbooks (1954 and 1956). Due to the restrictions of the communist government, communications between Hungary and the West by then had become difficult, and Ligeti and other artists were effectively cut off from recent developments outside the Eastern Bloc.

===After leaving Hungary===
In December 1956, two months after the Hungarian uprising was violently suppressed by the Soviet Army, Ligeti fled to Vienna with his ex-wife Vera Spitz. They remarried in 1957 and had a son together. He would not see Hungary again for fourteen years, when he was invited there to judge a competition in Budapest. On his rushed escape to Vienna, he left most of his Hungarian compositions in Budapest, some of which are now lost. He took only what he considered to be his most important pieces. He later said, &quot;I considered my old music of no interest. I believed in twelve-tone music!&quot; He eventually took Austrian citizenship in 1968.

A few weeks after arriving in Vienna, Ligeti left for Cologne. There he met several key avant-garde figures and learned more contemporary musical styles and methods. These people included the composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig, both then working on groundbreaking electronic music. During the summer, he attended the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. Ligeti worked in the Cologne Electronic Music Studio with Stockhausen and Koenig and was inspired by the sounds he heard there. However, he produced little electronic music of his own, instead concentrating on instrumental works which often contain electronic-sounding textures.

After about three years&#x27; working with them, he fell out with the Cologne School of Electronic Music, because there was much factional in-fighting: &quot;there were a lot of political fighting because different people, like Stockhausen, like Kagel wanted to be first. And I, personally, have no ambition to be first or to be important.&quot;

Between 1961 and 1971 he was guest professor for composition in Stockholm. In 1972 he became composer-in-residence at Stanford University in the United States.

In 1973 Ligeti became professor of composition at the Hamburg Hochschule für Musik und Theater, eventually retiring in 1989. While he was living in Hamburg, his wife Vera remained in Vienna with their son, Lukas, who later also became a composer.

Invited by Walter Fink, Ligeti was the first composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1990.

Apart from his far-reaching interest in different styles of music, from Renaissance to African music, Ligeti was also interested in literature (including the writers Lewis Carroll, Jorge Luis Borges, and Franz Kafka), painting, architecture, science, and mathematics. He was especially fascinated by the fractal geometry of Benoit Mandelbrot and the writings of Douglas Hofstadter.

===Death===

Ligeti&#x27;s health deteriorated after the turn of the millennium; he died in Vienna on 12 June 2006, at the age of 83. Although it was known that he had been ill for several years and had used a wheelchair for the last three years of his life, his family declined to release details of the cause of his death.

Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel and Art Secretary both paid tribute to Ligeti. His funeral was held at Feuerhalle Simmering. The memorial concert was performed by Pierre-Laurent Aimard and the Arnold Schoenberg Choir. His ashes were buried at Vienna Central Cemetery in a &quot;grave of honor&quot; ().

He was survived by his wife Vera and son Lukas. The latter is a composer and percussionist based in the United States.

==Music==
===Compositions in Hungary===
Many of Ligeti&#x27;s earliest works were written for chorus and included settings of folk songs. His largest work in this period was a graduation composition for the Budapest Academy, entitled &quot;Cantata for Youth Festival&quot;, for four vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra. One of his earliest pieces now in the repertoire is his &quot;Cello Sonata&quot;, a work in two contrasting movements that were written in 1948 and 1953. It was initially banned by the Soviet-run Composer&#x27;s Union and was not performed publicly for a quarter of a century.

Ligeti&#x27;s earliest works are often an extension of the musical language of Béla Bartók. Even his piano cycle &quot;Musica ricercata&quot; (1953), though written according to Ligeti with a &quot;Cartesian&quot; approach, in which he &quot;regarded all the music I knew and loved as being... irrelevant&quot;, the piece has been described by one biographer as from a world very close to Bartók&#x27;s set of piano works, &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot;. Ligeti&#x27;s set comprises eleven pieces in all. The work is based on a simple restriction: the first piece uses exclusively one pitch A, heard in multiple octaves, and only at the very end of the piece is a second note, D, heard. The second piece uses three notes (E, F, and G), the third piece uses four, and so on, so that in the final piece all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are present.

Shortly after its composition, Ligeti arranged six of the movements of &quot;Musica ricercata&quot; for wind quintet under the title &#x27;Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet&#x27;. The Bagatelles were performed first in 1956, but not in their entirety: the last movement was censored by the Soviets for being too &#x27;dangerous&#x27;.

Because of Soviet censorship, his most daring works from this period, including &quot;Musica ricercata&quot; and his String Quartet No. 1 &quot;Métamorphoses nocturnes&quot; (1953–1954), were written for the &#x27;bottom drawer&#x27;. Composed of a single movement divided into seventeen contrasting sections linked motivically, the First String Quartet is Ligeti&#x27;s first work to suggest a personal style of composition. The string quartet was not performed until 1958, after he had fled Hungary for Vienna.

===From 1956 to &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;===

Upon arriving in Cologne, Ligeti began to write electronic music alongside Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig at the electronic studio of West German Radio (WDR). He completed only two works in this medium, however—the pieces &quot;Glissandi&quot; (1957) and &quot;Artikulation&quot; (1958)—before returning to instrumental music. A third work, originally entitled &quot;Atmosphères&quot; but later known as &quot;Pièce électronique Nr. 3&quot;, was planned, but the technical limitations of the time prevented Ligeti from realizing it completely. It was finally realised in 1996 by the Dutch composers Kees Tazelaar and Johan van Kreij of the Institute of Sonology.

Ligeti&#x27;s music appears to have been subsequently influenced by his electronic experiments, and many of the sounds he created resembled electronic textures. Ligeti coined the term &quot;micropolyphony&quot; to describe the texture of the second movement of &quot;Apparitions&quot; (1958–59) and &quot;Atmosphères&quot; (1961). This texture is a similar to that of polyphony, except that the polyphony is obscured in a dense and rich stack of pitches. Micropolyphony can be used to create the nearly static but slowly evolving works such as &quot;Atmosphères&quot; in which the individual instruments become hidden in a complex web of sound. According to Ligeti, after &quot;Apparitions&quot; and &quot;Atmosphères&quot;, he &quot;became famous&quot;.

With &quot;Volumina&quot; (1961–62, revised 1966) for solo organ, Ligeti continued with clusters of notes, translated into blocks of sound. In this piece, Ligeti abandoned conventional music notation, instead using diagrams to represent general pitch areas, duration, and flurries of notes.

&quot;Poème symphonique&quot; (1962) is a work for one hundred mechanical metronomes during his brief acquaintance with Fluxus movement.

&quot;Aventures&quot; (1962), like its companion piece &quot;Nouvelles Aventures&quot; (1962–65), is a composition for three singers and instrumental septet, to a text (of Ligeti&#x27;s own devising) that is without semantic meaning. In these pieces, each singer has five roles to play, exploring five areas of emotion, and they switch from one to the other so quickly and abruptly that all five areas are present throughout the piece.

&quot;Requiem&quot; (1963–65) is a work for soprano and mezzo-soprano soloists, twenty-part chorus (four each of soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), and orchestra. Though, at about half an hour, it is the longest piece he had composed up to that point, Ligeti sets only about half of the Requiem&#x27;s traditional text: the &quot;Introitus&quot;, the &quot;Kyrie&quot; (a completely chromatic quasi-fugue, where the parts are a montage of melismatic, skipping micropolyphony), and the &quot;Dies irae&quot;—dividing the latter sequence into two parts, &quot;De die judicii&quot; and &quot;Lacrimosa&quot;.

&quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; (1966) is a 16-voice &quot;a cappella&quot; piece whose text is also associated with the Latin Requiem.

Ligeti&#x27;s Cello Concerto (1966), which is dedicated to Siegfried Palm, is composed of two movements: the first begins with an almost imperceptible cello which slowly shifts into static tone clusters with the orchestra before reaching a crescendo and slowly decaying, while the second is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody on the part of the cello.

&quot;Lontano&quot; (1967), for full orchestra, is another example of micropolyphony, but the overall effect is closer to harmony, with complex woven textures and opacity of the sound giving rise to a harmonious effect. It has become a standard repertoire piece.

String Quartet No. 2 (1968) consists of five movements. They differ widely from each other in their types of motion. In the first, the structure is largely broken up, as in &quot;Aventures&quot;. In the second, everything is reduced to very slow motion, and the music seems to be coming from a distance, with great lyricism. The &quot;pizzicato&quot; third movement is a machine-like studies, hard and mechanical, whereby the parts playing repeated notes create a &quot;granulated&quot; continuum. In the fourth, which is fast and threatening, everything that happened before is crammed together. Lastly, in strong contrast, the fifth movement spreads itself out. In each movement, the same basic configurations return, but each time their colouring or viewpoint is different, so that the overall form only really emerges when one listens to all five movements in context.

&quot;Ramifications&quot; (1968–69), completed a year before the Chamber Concerto, is scored for an ensemble of strings in twelve parts—seven violins, two violas, two cellos and a double bass—each of which may be taken by one player or several. The twelve are divided into two numerically equal groups but with the instruments in the first group tuned approximately a quarter-tone higher (four violins, a viola and a cello). As the group play, the one tuned higher inevitably tends to slide down toward the other, and both get nearer each other in pitch.

In the &quot;Chamber Concerto&quot; (1969–70), several layers, processes and kinds of movement can take place on different planes simultaneously. In spite of frequent markings of &quot;senza tempo&quot;, the instrumentalists are not given linear freedom; Ligeti insists on keeping his texture under strict control at any given moment. The form is like a &quot;precision mechanism&quot;. Ligeti was always fascinated by machines that do not work properly and by the world of technology and automation. The use of periodic mechanical noises, suggesting not-quite-reliable machinery, occurs in many of his works. The scoring is for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe (doubling oboe d&#x27;amore and cor anglais), clarinet, bass clarinet (doubling second clarinet), horn, trombone, harpsichord (doubling Hammond organ), piano (doubling celesta), and solo string quintet. He also wrote a Double Concerto for Flute, Oboe &amp; Orchestra (1972).

Most of these compositions establish timbre, rather than the traditionally-favored dimensions of pitch and rhythm, as their principal formal parameter, a practice that has come to be known as sonorism. From the 1970s, Ligeti turned away from sonorism and began to concentrate on rhythm. Pieces such as &quot;Continuum&quot; (1968) and &quot;Clocks and Clouds&quot; (1972–73) were written before he heard the music of Steve Reich and Terry Riley in 1972. But the second of his &quot;Three Pieces for Two Pianos&quot; (1976), entitled &quot;Self-portrait with Reich and Riley (and Chopin in the background)&quot;, commemorates this affirmation and influence. During the 1970s, he also became interested in the polyphonic pipe music of the Banda-Linda tribe from the Central African Republic, which he heard through the recordings of one of his students.

In 1977, Ligeti completed his only opera, &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;, thirteen years after its initial commission. Loosely based on Michel de Ghelderode&#x27;s 1934 play, &quot;La balade du grand macabre&quot;, it is a work of Absurd theatre—Ligeti called it an &quot;anti-anti-opera&quot;—in which Death (Nekrotzar) arrives in the fictional city of Breughelland and announces that the end of the world will occur at midnight. Musically, &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; draws on techniques not associated with Ligeti&#x27;s previous work, including quotations and pseudo-quotations of other works and the use of consonant thirds and sixths. After &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;, Ligeti would abandon the use of pastiche, but would increasingly incorporate consonant harmonies (even major and minor triads) into his work, albeit not in a diatonic context.

===After &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;===
After &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;, Ligeti struggled for some time to find a new style. Besides two short pieces for harpsichord, he did not complete another major work until the Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano in 1982, over four years after the opera. His music of the 1980s and 1990s continued to emphasise complex mechanical rhythms, often in a less densely chromatic idiom, tending to favour displaced major and minor triads and polymodal structures. During this time, Ligeti also began to explore alternate tuning systems through the use of natural harmonics for horns (as in the Horn Trio and Piano Concerto) and scordatura for strings (as in the Violin Concerto). Additionally, most of his works in this period are multi-movement works, rather than the extended single movements of &quot;Atmosphères&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Polyphony&quot;.

From 1985 to 2001, Ligeti completed three books of Études for piano (Book I, 1985; Book II, 1988–94; Book III, 1995–2001). Comprising eighteen compositions in all, the Études draw from a diverse range of sources, including gamelan, African polyrhythms, Béla Bartók, Conlon Nancarrow, Thelonious Monk, and Bill Evans. Book I was written as preparation for the Piano Concerto, which contains a number of similar motivic and melodic elements. Ligeti&#x27;s music from the last two decades of his life is unmistakable for its rhythmic complexity. Writing about his first book of Piano Études, the composer claims this rhythmic complexity stems from two vastly different sources of inspiration: the Romantic-era piano music of Chopin and Schumann and the indigenous music of sub-Saharan Africa.

The difference between the earlier and later pieces lies in a new conception of pulse. In the earlier works, the pulse is something to be divided into two, three and so on. The effect of these different subdivisions, especially when they occur simultaneously, is to blur the aural landscape, creating the micropolyphonic effect of Ligeti&#x27;s music.

On the other hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as &quot;Continuum&quot;—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit, which cannot be divided further. Different rhythms appear through multiplications of the basic pulse, rather than divisions: this is the principle of African music seized on by Ligeti. It also appears in the music of Philip Glass, Steve Reich and others; and significantly it shares much in common with the additive rhythms of Balkan folk music, the music of Ligeti&#x27;s youth. He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as &quot;the greatest discovery since Webern and Ives... something great and important for all music history! His music is so utterly original, enjoyable, perfectly constructed, but at the same time emotional... for me it&#x27;s the best music of any composer living today.&quot;

In 1988, Ligeti completed his Piano Concerto, writing that &quot;I present my artistic credo in the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot;: I demonstrate my independence from criteria of the traditional avantgarde, as well as the fashionable postmodernism.&quot; Initial sketches of the Concerto began in 1980, but it was not until 1985 that he found a way forward and the work proceeded more quickly. The Concerto explores many of the ideas worked out in the Études but in an orchestral context.
In 1993, Ligeti completed his Violin Concerto after four years of work. Like the Piano Concerto, the Violin Concerto uses the wide range of techniques he had developed up until that point as well as the new ideas he was working out at the moment. Among other techniques, it uses a passacaglia, &quot;microtonality, rapidly changing textures, comic juxtapositions... Hungarian folk melodies, Bulgarian dance rhythms, references to Medieval and Renaissance music and solo violin writing that ranges from the slow-paced and sweet-toned to the angular and fiery.&quot;

Other notable works from this period are the Viola Sonata (1994) and the &quot;Nonsense Madrigals&quot; (1988–93), a set of six a cappella compositions that set English texts from William Brighty Rands, Lewis Carroll, and Heinrich Hoffman. The third Madrigal is a setting of the English alphabet.

Ligeti&#x27;s last works were the &quot;Hamburg Concerto&quot; for solo horn, four natural horns and chamber orchestra (1998–99, revised 2003, dedicated to Marie-Luise Neunecker), the song cycle &quot;Síppal, dobbal, nádihegedűvel&quot; (&quot;With Pipes, Drums, Fiddles&quot;, 2000), and the eighteenth piano étude &quot;Canon&quot; (2001). The printed score and the manuscript of the &quot;Hamburg Concerto&quot; contain numerous errors and inconsistencies. The revision of the piece, realized by the Italian composer Alessio Elia and published in the book &quot;The Hamburgisches Konzert by György Ligeti&quot;, published by Edition Impronta, was used for the first revised performance of this work, realized by the Concerto Budapest Ligeti Ensemble with Szabolcs Zempléni as solo horn. The orchestra should have been conducted by Peter Eötvös, replaced due to indisposition by Gergely Vajda. Additionally, after &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;, Ligeti planned to write a second opera, first to be based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; and later on Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, but neither came to fruition.
==Legacy==
Ligeti has been described as &quot;together with Boulez, Berio, Stockhausen, and Cage as one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time&quot;. From about 1960, Ligeti&#x27;s work became better known and respected. His best-known work was written during the period from &quot;Apparitions&quot; to &quot;Lontano&quot;, which includes &quot;Atmosphères&quot;, &quot;Volumina&quot;, &quot;Aventures&quot; and &quot;Nouvelles Aventures&quot;, &quot;Requiem&quot;, &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;, and his Cello Concerto; as well as his opera &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot;. In recent years, his three books of piano études have also become well known and are the subject of the &quot;Inside the Score&quot; project of pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard.

===Music in the films of Stanley Kubrick===
Ligeti&#x27;s music is best known to the public not acquainted with 20th century classical music for its use in three films of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s, which gained him a world-wide audience. The soundtrack to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; includes excerpts from four of his pieces: &quot;Atmosphères&quot;, &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;, &quot;Requiem&quot; and &quot;Aventures&quot;. &quot;Atmosphères&quot; is heard during the &quot;Star Gate&quot; sequence, with portions also heard in the Overture and Intermission. &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; is heard in the moon-bus scene en route to the Tycho monolith. The &quot;Kyrie&quot; sequence of his &quot;Requiem&quot; is heard over the first three monolith encounters. An electronically altered version of &quot;Aventures&quot;, unlisted in the film credits, is heard in the cryptic final scenes. The music was used, and in some cases modified, without Ligeti&#x27;s knowledge, and without full copyright clearance. When he learned about the use of his music in the film, he &quot;successfully sued for having had his music distorted&quot; and they settled out of court. Kubrick sought permission and compensated Ligeti for use of his music in later films.

&quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; was used again in Peter Hyams&#x27;s 1984 sequel to &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;.

A later Kubrick film, &quot;The Shining&quot;, uses small portions of &quot;Lontano&quot; for orchestra.

One motif from the second movement of Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Musica ricercata&quot; is used at pivotal moments in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. At the German premiere of that film, by which time Kubrick had died, his widow was escorted by Ligeti himself.

===Music in other films and media===

Ligeti&#x27;s work has also been used in numerous films by other directors. &quot;Lontano&quot; was also used in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2010 psychological thriller film &quot;Shutter Island&quot;. The first movement of the Cello Concerto was used in the Michael Mann 1995 crime film &quot;Heat&quot;. The &quot;Requiem&quot; was used in the 2014 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;. The Cello Concerto and the Piano Concerto were used in Yorgos Lanthimos&#x27; 2017 film &quot;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&quot;.

His music has also been used in television and radio. &quot;Lontano&quot;, &quot;Atmosphères&quot;, and the first movement of the Cello Concerto were used in Sophie Fiennes&#x27;s documentary &quot;Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow&quot;, about the German post-war artist Anselm Kiefer. &quot;Lontano&quot;, &quot;Melodien&quot;, and &quot;Volumina&quot; were used in Fit the First, Fit the Fifth, and of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; as background music to sections of narrative from the Guide.

<doc id="145261" wikidata="Q496879" url="?curid=145261" title="Spectre (DC Comics character)">
<text>The Spectre is the name of several antiheroes who appear in American comic books published by DC Comics. The original version first appeared in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #52 (February 1940). The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Bernard Baily although some sources attribute creator credit solely to Siegel, limiting Baily to the artist assigned to the feature.

The Spectre is a divine entity representing vengeance on behalf of The Presence, considered God in the context of Abrahamic religion. Initially a demon named Aztar, he rebelled against God but later sought forgiveness and was granted a divine role. As the Spectre, Aztar possesses immense power, making him one of the most formidable beings in the DC Universe. He is bound to a human host who assists him in judging the transgressions of humanity and other beings, determining suitable punishments. These judgments are often delivered in a harsh and creatively ironic manner. The Spectre has had multiple hosts throughout its history. The primary host is [[Jim Corrigan|James &quot;Jim&quot; Corrigan]], a Gotham City detective who was killed and resurrected as the Spectre. [[Hal Jordan]] also became the Spectre to redeem himself after his actions as Parallax, becoming a force of redemption. [[Crispus Allen]], another Gotham detective, served as a host despite his doubts about God&#x27;s existence.

The character has appeared in various media adaptations. Most notable, the character appeared within the Arrowverse. One version appears on &quot;Constantine&quot; portrayed by Emmett J. Scanlan and another alternate version appears in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover, portrayed by Stephen Lobo. 

==Publication history==
===Golden Age version===
The Spectre debuted in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #52 (February 1940) when hard-boiled cop Jim Corrigan, on his way with his fiancée Clarice to their engagement party, is murdered by thugs who stuff him into a barrel filled with cement, which is then thrown into a body of water. Corrigan&#x27;s spirit is refused entrance into the afterlife, and is instead sent back to Earth by an entity referred to only as &quot;the Voice&quot; to eliminate evil.

The Spectre seeks bloody vengeance against Corrigan&#x27;s murderers in grim, supernatural fashion. One of them was turned into a skeleton upon touching him. Corrigan soon creates his signature costume, breaks off his romance with Clarice, and continues to live as Jim Corrigan, assuming the secret identity of the Spectre whenever he is needed. He eventually turns down an offer to relinquish his mission to destroy all evil.

The Spectre soon is awarded charter membership in the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America in &quot;All Star Comics&quot;. Jim Corrigan is resurrected in &quot;More Fun&quot; #75 (January 1942), after which the Spectre&#x27;s ghostly form enters and emerges from Jim Corrigan, functioning independently of him. During the mid-1940s, the popularity of superhero comics began to decline and the Spectre was reduced to playing the role of guardian angel to a bumbling character called &quot;Percival Popp, the Super Cop&quot;, who first appeared in &quot;More Fun&quot; #74 (December 1941). When Corrigan enlisted in the military and departed to serve in World War II, in &quot;More Fun&quot; #90 (April 1943), the Spectre became permanently invisible, becoming a secondary player in his own series. The feature&#x27;s final installment was in issue #101 (February 1945) and the Spectre made his last appearance in the superhero group the Justice Society of America at roughly the same time in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #23 (winter 1944–1945).

===Silver Age version===
In the mid-1950s and 1960s Silver Age of Comic Books, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the Spectre and returned him to the role of an avenging spirit, beginning in &quot;Showcase&quot; #60 (February 1966). Under writer Gardner Fox and penciller Murphy Anderson, his power was vastly increased, at times approaching omnipotence. A 1987 magazine retrospective on the character said this revival had been initially announced as a team-up with Doctor Mid-Nite. After a three-issue try-out in &quot;Showcase&quot;, the Spectre appeared in the superhero-team comic &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #46–47 in that year&#x27;s team-up of the titular group and its 1940s predecessors, the Justice Society of America, written by Gardner Fox. A few months later, he co-starred with the Silver Age Flash in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #72 (July 1967).

The Spectre was given his own title, premiering in December 1967, while simultaneously making another appearance in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #75 (January 1968), this time teamed with Batman. In &quot;The Spectre&quot;, the creative credits varied in the 10 issues published, with introduction of a then-newcomer to comics, Neal Adams, who drew issues #2–5 and wrote issues #4–5. For its final two issues, the comic became in effect a horror anthology, with the title character being little more than a narrator in several short stories. The Spectre title suffered from the same problem that vexed the Golden Age series: writing meaningful stories using a character who was virtually omnipotent.

This era&#x27;s end came at the climax of a JLA/JSA crossover when Doctor Fate frees the Ghostly Guardian from a crypt in time to block a collision between Earth-One and Earth-Two caused by an alien device planted inside the android Red Tornado. The Spectre&#x27;s body is torn apart when Doctor Fate creates a massive explosion to destroy the device and return the colliding Earths to their own dimensions.

===Bronze Age version===

In the 1970s, DC revived the Spectre again in the superhero anthology series &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;. Editor Joe Orlando explained that this was the Earth-One version of the Spectre, though some at DC said otherwise. Later stories explained that the Spectre had moved from Earth-Two and taken over the body of the Jim Corrigan of Earth-One. Beginning with the 12-page &quot;The Wrath of ... the Spectre&quot; in issue #431 (February 1974), writer Michael Fleisher and artist Jim Aparo produced 10 stories through issue #440 (July 1975) that became controversial for what was considered gruesome, albeit bloodless, violence. Comics historian Les Daniels commented that the Spectre had

In the series&#x27; letter column, some fans indicated uneasiness with this depiction. In issue #435 (October 1974), Fleisher introduced a character that shared their concerns, a reporter named Earl Crawford. The series was cancelled with three scripts written, but not yet drawn. Several years later, these remaining three chapters were penciled by Aparo, lettered and inked by others, and published in the final issue of &quot;Wrath of the Spectre&quot;, a four-issue miniseries in 1988 that reprinted the 10 original Fleisher-Aparo stories in its first three issues and three newly drawn stories in the fourth one. Fleisher had stated in 1980 that only two scripts were left undrawn.

The Spectre also made a guest appearance in the &quot;Doctor Thirteen&quot; feature in &quot;Ghosts&quot; #97–99 (February–April 1981) and would go on to periodic guest appearances in such other DC titles as &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; and &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;.

A new Spectre series was planned for 1986, with Steve Gerber as writer and Gene Colan as penciler. However, Gerber missed the deadline for the first issue so that he could watch the last day of shooting on the film &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; and DC cancelled the series in response.

Among the many changes made to DC Comics&#x27; characters during the latter half of the 1980s following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries, the Spectre fought the Anti-Monitor largely depowered. Prior to this, the Spectre is revealed to be guarding an entrance to Hell in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 2) Annual #2 by writer Alan Moore and artists Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben. Then, in the conclusion to Moore&#x27;s &quot;American Gothic&quot; storyline in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 2) #35-50, the Spectre is defeated by the Great Evil Beast. Next, in the &quot;Last Days of the Justice Society of America&quot; special, the Spectre fails to resolve a situation and is punished by God for his failure.

In his fourth solo series and second self-titled comic, &quot;The Spectre&quot;, under writer Doug Moench, Corrigan became the central figure in this story of an occult-oriented private detective agency. The Spectre&#x27;s powers were significantly reduced here, with even the act of emerging from Corrigan&#x27;s physical body being painful to both. This run ended with issue #31 (November 1989). A few months after this, the Spectre had a cameo in writer Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, a four-issue miniseries starring many DC occult characters.

===Modern Age version===
Three years after the cancellation of the Doug Moench version, the Spectre was again given his own series, this time written by writer and former theology student John Ostrander, who chose to re-examine the Spectre in his aspects as both the embodied Avenging Wrath of the Murdered Dead and as a brutal 1930s policeman.

Ostrander placed the Spectre in complex, morally ambiguous situations that posed certain ethical questions, one example being: What vengeance should be wrought upon a woman who killed her abusive husband in his sleep? Other notable dilemmas included:

* The nation of Vlatava, the history of which was an endless cycle of civil war, ethnic cleansing, retribution, and blood feuds that had endured for centuries. The Spectre responded by judging the whole nation guilty, razing the land and killing the entire population except for two opposing politicians, one of them the supervillain Count Vertigo.
* The pending execution of a wrongfully convicted man. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after the Spectre threatened to kill the entire population of the state of New York in retribution, arguing that if the execution was carried out, the &quot;people of the state of New York&quot; would become guilty of murder in his eyes.
* A 90-year-old woman who had spent her entire life trying to atone for the single murder she had secretly committed in the 1920s. The Spectre found her on her deathbed.

Ostrander also added several new concepts into the Spectre&#x27;s history: He revealed that the Spectre was meant to exist as the embodiment of the Wrath of God, and Jim Corrigan was but the latest human spirit assigned to guide him while he existed on Earth. It was also shown that the Spectre was a fallen angel named Aztar who had participated in Lucifer&#x27;s rebellion, but then repented, and that serving as the embodiment of God&#x27;s anger was its penance.

Furthermore, the Spectre was not the first embodiment of God&#x27;s anger, but was the replacement for the previously minor DC character Eclipso. Ostrander chose to portray this as a distinction between the Spectre&#x27;s pursuit of &quot;vengeance&quot; and Eclipso&#x27;s pursuit of &quot;revenge&quot;. In a historical context, Eclipso was responsible for the biblical Flood, while the Spectre was the Angel of Death who slew the firstborn Egyptian children. The Spectre and Eclipso have battled numerous times through history, but neither entity can be fully destroyed.

The Spectre has also played a pivotal role in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot; storylines. In both cases, in the final struggle against the main villain (the Anti-Monitor and Parallax, respectively), the Spectre is the only hero capable of standing against the villains directly, allowing the other heroes time to put a plan into action that would destroy the villains once and for all.

Although all of these versions are usually considered to be from the Earth-Two of the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC Multiverse (the same continuity started during the Golden Age), an Earth-One version of the Spectre was shown to team up with Batman and Superman on a few occasions.

===Hal Jordan, Spirit of Redemption===
Eventually, Corrigan&#x27;s soul finds peace. He relinquishes the Spectre-Force and goes on to Heaven. The role of the Spectre is later assumed by Hal Jordan, the spirit of the former Green Lantern, during the &quot;Day of Judgment&quot; storyline written by Geoff Johns, when a fallen angel attempts to gain the Spectre&#x27;s power. Corrigan is asked to come back, but refuses as he has found peace. The Spectre-Force chooses Jordan as his new host because Jordan seeks to atone for his universe-threatening actions as the villainous Parallax. His next appearance was in a four-part story arc in &quot;Legends of the DC Universe&quot; #33–36. In the series &quot;The Spectre&quot; (vol. 4), written by J. M. DeMatteis, Jordan bends the Spectre&#x27;s mission from one of vengeance to one of redemption and makes appearances elsewhere in the DC Universe, such as advising Superman during the &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; storyline or helping Wally West keep his family safe by erasing public knowledge of his true identity.

In the 2001 Green Arrow storyline &quot;Quiver&quot; written by Kevin Smith and the final Supergirl story arc, &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; by Peter David, revealed that the Spectre (Hal Jordan) is aware of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. He is one of the few DC Universe characters with this knowledge.

After &quot;The Spectre&quot; (vol. 4) was cancelled, Jordan was forced to return, temporarily, to the Spectre&#x27;s mission of vengeance, following a confrontation between the new Justice Society of America and the Spirit King. The Spirit King had managed to &quot;resurrect&quot; the ghosts of all those the Spectre had damned to Hell, as Hal&#x27;s attempt to turn the Spectre&#x27;s mission to redemption weakened his hold on the damned. The JSA attempted to keep the spirits contained, but ultimately they were only defeated when Hal &#x27;accepted&#x27; his original mission of vengeance, concluding that his goal of redemption was only about helping himself. In &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;, written by Johns, the Spectre-Force&#x27;s decision of choosing Jordan as his host was retconned into being not because of Jordan&#x27;s worthiness, but as an effort to destroy the Parallax entity, which was infecting Jordan&#x27;s soul. After the Spectre-Force was able to purge Parallax from Jordan, it departed to move on to the next recipient of the spirit.

===&quot;Day of Vengeance&quot;===

Without a human host, the Spectre-Force becomes unstable and goes on a vengeance-fueled rampage. Not only is it killing murderers, it also kills people for minor crimes, such as petty theft. Its lack of a human host deprives it of the ability to effectively judge the sins in their appropriate context. As detailed in the miniseries &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot;, Jean Loring is transformed into the new Eclipso. She goes after the Spectre and seduces him into removing all magic in the DC Universe. Eclipso explains to the Spectre that all things that follow the rules of the physical universe follow God&#x27;s law. Anything that breaks those rules thus breaks God&#x27;s law and is therefore evil. Consequently, as magic breaks the rules of the physical universe, it is an originating source of tremendous evil (this line of logic makes sense to the unstable Spectre-Force). The Spectre destroys magical constructs, institutions that teach magic and magical dimensions. In one such dimension, his acts include the mass murder of over 700 battle-hardened magicians. His actions cause havoc to other very powerful magic-based characters:

* The Phantom Stranger – The Spectre turns him into a mouse.
* Black Adam – He fights the Spectre when the spirit invades his kingdom of Kahndaq and causes plagues of destruction.
* Doctor Fate – He is imprisoned in a dimension inside his helmet.
* Madame Xanadu – Her eyes are destroyed (and made incapable of restoration through magic) by the Spectre to prevent her from reading her magical tarot cards.
* Raven – She can no longer properly control her powers.
* The wizard Shazam – Despite the intervention of his champion Captain Marvel, Shazam is killed by the Spectre.

The Spectre also destroys the magic-fueled kingdom of Atlantis (the home of Aquaman) during his rampage.

In &quot;Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special&quot; #1, the Spectre kills Nabu, the last of the Great Lords of the Ninth Age and the Presence&#x27;s attention is finally drawn into action. The Spectre is once again forced into a human host, stopping his mad rampage. Nabu reveals before dying that originally he and the other Lords had been working towards forming the perfect host for the Spectre, but those plans are cut short.

The text of the story is unclear on who the Great Lords were. Nabu (introduced in 1942 as the powerful entity responsible for Kent Nelson becoming Doctor Fate) was one of the Lords of Order. The Spectre had apparently killed the others, along with their counterparts the Lords of Chaos, with the exception of Mordru and Amethyst (whom he battled on Gemworld). Amethyst is among those gathered by the Phantom Stranger to aid in rebuilding the Rock of Eternity, and survives into the Tenth Age.

Alexander Luthor also revealed that he was indirectly responsible for the Spectre&#x27;s actions in &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot;. Under Alexander Luthor&#x27;s orders, the Psycho-Pirate gave Eclipso&#x27;s diamond to Jean Loring, making her manipulate the Spectre-Force so that magic could be undone and used as fuel for Luthor&#x27;s Multiverse tower.

===Crispus Allen===
In &quot;Gotham Central&quot; #38, Crispus Allen is killed by a corrupt policeman coincidentally named Jim Corrigan (not the same Corrigan that was formerly associated with the Spectre). While Allen&#x27;s body is in the morgue, the Spectre-Force is forced against its will to enter Crispus Allen, taking Allen as its new host.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
During the 2009–2010 &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Black Hand reveals that the Spectre must be moved out of the way in order for the universe to be at peace. For that, he uses the Black Lantern Pariah, who unleashes more black rings which latch themselves onto Crispus&#x27; body (who was killed by Eclipso), turning him into a Black Lantern and sealing the Spectre-Force inside its host. Changing into a giant version, the Black Lantern Spectre declares that it wants Hal Jordan back. The Phantom Stranger and Blue Devil work together in an attempt to distract the Black Lantern Spectre from seeking out Hal Jordan. The Phantom Stranger manages to temporarily free the real Spectre, only for the Black Lantern to repress it again and, discarding the Stranger and Blue Devil, leaves to carry out its intention to cast vengeance on Hal Jordan.

In Coast City, Hal Jordan encounters the Black Lantern Spectre. Using the real Spectre-Force&#x27;s power to protect itself, it is rendered immune to the combination of emotional lights that usually destroy Black Lanterns. Knowing that the Spectre is afraid of Parallax, Jordan allows himself to be possessed by the fear entity once more to stop him. The powers of the Spectre also become of interest to the Red Lantern Corps leader Atrocitus, as he senses the Spectre&#x27;s real nature despite being influenced by the black ring: an embodiment of rage and vengeance. Atrocitus desires to harness the spirit&#x27;s power for his corps and his own vengeance against the Guardians of the Universe. Parallax tears into the Black Lantern&#x27;s body, freeing the real Spectre-Force and destroying the facsimile. Atrocitus attempts to turn the Spectre into his own rage entity but fails, the Spectre telling him that &quot;he is God&#x27;s rage&quot; and of the true rage entity and warning him not to trifle with it. Parallax then attempts to destroy the Spectre, who uses his own fear of the entity coupled with the love Carol Ferris feels for Hal, to separate Parallax from its host. The Spectre then confronts Nekron, the master of the Black Lanterns, but discovers that Nekron is without a soul and is thus immune to his powers. The Spectre is then removed from the battlefield by Nekron to parts unknown.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
In the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; storyline, the Spectre resurfaces, again with Crispus Allen as its host, in the hills of Montana on the trail of the Butcher, the Red Lantern entity. The Spectre confronts Atrocitus once again when the two locate the Butcher, who is about to possess a man whose daughter had been killed by a death row inmate. Despite the Spectre&#x27;s attempts to stop it, the Butcher succeeds, killing the criminal. The Butcher then attempts to possess Atrocitus, revealing that Atrocitus had a wife and children who were killed in the Manhunters&#x27; attack. With the Spectre&#x27;s help, Atrocitus wards off the Butcher and imprisons it within his power battery. The Spectre attempts to judge the man that the Butcher possessed, but Atrocitus argues that his method of judgment is flawed. The Spectre calls off his judgment and is unable to judge Atrocitus, discovering that his mission is a &quot;holy&quot; one, although he warns Atrocitus that this will not last forever.

===&quot;Rise of Eclipso&quot;===
The Spectre later appears during James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Rise of Eclipso&quot; storyline in &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. In the story, Eclipso captures the angel Zauriel and begins to torture him to draw the attention of the Spectre. The plan succeeds, with the Spectre traveling to the moon to rescue Zauriel, only to be ambushed by Jade and the members of the Justice League&#x27;s reserve roster, all of whom had been brainwashed by Eclipso. Once the heroes wear the Spectre down, Eclipso confronts his old nemesis and seemingly kills him by cleaving the Spectre in two. Eclipso then absorbs the Spectre&#x27;s immense powers, which he then uses to shatter the moon with a single blow from his sword before attempting to use them to fulfill his sinister agenda. Eclipso is defeated by the reserve Justice League.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
Jim Corrigan is a Gotham City Police Detective whose fiancé is kidnapped. He is guided by the Phantom Stranger on the instructions of the Voice. He leads Corrigan to the abandoned warehouse where his girlfriend is being kept, but this turns out to be a trap. Corrigan and his girlfriend are killed by the kidnappers and he is then transformed into the Spectre, who accuses the Phantom Stranger of betraying him. As the Spectre is about to attack the Phantom Stranger, the Voice intervenes and sends the Spectre off to inflict his wrath on those who are more deserving of it.

It is revealed that the Voice chose Corrigan to be &quot;the mirror of his desire for justice&quot; (though Corrigan believes in vengeance) and imbued him with divine powers. Corrigan returns to work as a police detective in Gotham City, but his rage causes him to practice vengeance rather than justice in his alter ego as the Spectre. The Phantom Stranger attacks Corrigan&#x27;s police precinct, convinced that Corrigan was the one who kidnapped his family out of revenge.
After the two exchange blows physically and verbally, the Voice himself intervenes in the form of a Scottish Terrier (his sense of humor) and informs the Stranger of his mistake, setting him on the right path. The Voice also sets Corrigan straight on his duty, making him realize he is meant to exact justice, not vengeance.

Batman calls in Corrigan and Batwing to investigate Arkham Asylum, because he believes something supernatural is going on and was already busy trying to end a violent gang war in Gotham. Corrigan and Batwing investigate and discover a demonic Deacon Blackfire commanding an army of corrupted humans and demons in the sewers beneath the asylum.

Corrigan eventually joins Gotham&#x27;s Detailed Case Task Force, a small precinct responsible for investigating supernatural events off the books.

== Character overview ==
The Spectre is described as a godlike anti-hero character who punishes those considered evil under the purview of the DC Universe&#x27;s highest authority and adaptation of God in Abrahamic religions, The Presence. While functioning as a cosmic aspect responsible for bringing justice and embodies divine wrath, the Spectre is often characterized as being considered harsh and unforgiving in his punishments. Due to his nature, the Spectre also bonds with a human spirit to keep his powers in check and to temper the entity with a level of empathy. The Spectre is also widely regarded among the most powerful superheroes in the fictional universe and has been portrayed as surpassing other characters possessing substantial supernatural abilities such as Doctor Fate, the Wizard Shazam, and the Lords of Chaos and Order.

=== Spiritual hosts ===
For a time, the Spectre was considered a force of its own but after the death of Jesus, the incarnation of divine wrath was ordained to be bonded to a human soul in order to temper its more violent tendencies. Many incarnations of the Spectre existed prior to Corrigan, with them embodying traits and attributes of divine beings based upon their given beliefs/religion.

==== Chakara ====
The first individual to be bonded to Aztar was retroactively revealed to be a Hindu man from India named Chakara whose family was slain by the necromancer Belatine. Crying out for justice, Chakara is selected to be the first Spirit of Vengeance. Unlike the mainstream versions of the character that followed, Chakara&#x27;s incarnation of the Spectre did not possess the appearance typical of Spectre incarnations but was instead given traits and attributes similar to the Hindu god of destruction, Shiva.

==== James &quot;Jim&quot; Corrigan ====

Jim Corrigan is a detective of New York City who grew up with a abusive father, who was a fundamentalist preacher and taught God&#x27;s wrath came to those who sinned. After enduring abuse for years, Corrigan ran away from home to enlist in the Army before eventually settling as a detective in New York. Arrogant and mean-spirited for a time, Corrigan was eventually killed by mobster Gat Benson in 1940 but found himself bonded to the Spectre (Aztar) as his soul cried for vengeance. While now undead, Corrigan returned to work while also operating as the hero Spectre, eventually becoming a founding member of the Justice Society of America.

==== Hal Jordan ====
A Green Lantern of the Green Lantern Corps, a intergalactic law enforcement organization, Hal was recently deceased but during the Day of Judgement storyline, became the new incarnation of Spectre. Unlike other versions, he viewed himself as a Spirit of Redemption instead of Vengeance. Jordan&#x27;s true purpose as the Spectre was to purge himself of the last vestiges of Parallax&#x27;s evil within his soul before returning to life as Green Lantern.

==== Crispus Allen ====

Crispus Allen is a detective in Gotham City and family man who was considered one of the city&#x27;s most honest cops. Originally from Metropolis, Allen transferred to Gotham and was partnered with fellow detective Renee Montoya. Allen is eventually murdered by a corrupt cop named Jim Corrigan (no known relation to the first Spectre host) but is bonded with Aztar similar to the first host. Unlike the past versions, the Spectre enforces his role as a vengeful spirit (due to events of Day of Vengeance) more hardily while Allen tries to balance him out as a heroic force but also finds himself giving into the same vengeful tendencies as Aztar despite his moralistic background.

== Fictional history ==
The being that eventually would become the Spectre was a fallen angel named Aztar who joined Lucifer Morningstar&#x27;s rebellion. After being cast into Hell alongside those who betrayed God, Aztar begged for forgiveness towards the archangel Michael, who through God appoints him as God&#x27;s wrath but erases all his memories and lifetime experienced as punishment. Now the new embodiment of God&#x27;s wrath and replacing Eclipso, Aztar as the Spectre would be responsible for various acts: the Spectre was the incarnation who carried out the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah detailed in the &quot;Book of Genesis&quot; circa 3000 BCE, the Plagues of Egypt detailed in the &quot;Book of Exodus&quot; despite Nabu of the Lords of Order&#x27;s intervention in 1263 BCE, and the Fall of Jericho described in the &quot;Book of Joshua&quot;. However, the birth of Jesus banished the Specte into limbo due to the former embodying forgiveness, with the embodiments of wrath and forgiveness unable to co-exist simultaneously. 

However, the crucifixion of Jesus recalled the Spectre back, whom sought vengeance but is stopped by the archangel Michael, who subdues the erratic divine force as God decrees the Spectre must be bound to a human spirit due to Jesus&#x27;s example. The first incantation bonded was to an Indian man who was credited instead as a aspect of Shiva when he sought vengeance for necromancer Beltane killing his family. Many other incarnations followed, with them coming against reincarnated forms of Beltane as among the Spectre&#x27;s many enemies.

==Powers and abilities==
An extremely powerful cosmic being, the Spectre is classified as a &quot;judge&quot;, considered one of the most powerful magical forces within the DC Multiverse due to being directly empowered by the Presence; and, when unbound, his power is considered apocalyptic. At his peak, the Spectre possess near omnipotent magical and physical abilities, making him capable of virtually any feat, controlling space, time, reality, and matter. He also has an extensive mastery over other &quot;basic&quot; superpowers such as energy manipulation, superhuman strength, flight and possesses extensive mental abilities capable of inducing illusions and hallucinations. Even when depowered by the Presence, the Spectre remains widely regarded as the most powerful spirit on Earth, possessing a diverse range of abilities. These include the capacity to become intangible, animate and possess objects, intrude upon an individual&#x27;s mind or soul, and draw others into his own being, where his power reigns supreme.

=== Weaknesses ===
The Spectre has several weaknesses, susceptible to powerful forms of magic and requires a human host to function accordingly. He is also subject to specific divine laws and tasks set by the Presence and is vulnerable to the artifact known as the Spear of Destiny, capable of killing him due to its being bathed in the blood of Jesus Christ.

==Other versions==

* Several other incarnations of the Spectre have appeared in the past: one was an Irish woman brutalized by highway men. As the Spectre, her appearance and mannerisms were more akin to a banshee. Other human spirits&#x27; appearance implied them to be Arab and be Native American.

He takes a preacher named Norman McCay through the events of a possible future to determine the source of an impending apocalyptic event as his &quot;faculties are not what they once were&quot; and he requires an outsider&#x27;s perspective to properly judge events. Amidst this, McCay reminds Corrigan of his humanity and befriends him.
* An alternate universe variant of the Spectre named Taylor Pike appears in Tangent Comics. He is a prodigy who bombarded himself with neutrino energy and gained intangibility. Initially operating as a thief, he later joined the Secret Six.

<text>Edgar Jean Faure (; 18 August 1908 – 30 March 1988) was a French politician, lawyer, essayist, historian and memoirist who served as Prime Minister of France in 1952 and again between 1955 and 1956. Prior to his election to the National Assembly for Jura under the Fourth Republic in 1946, he was a member of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN) in Algiers (1943–1944). A Radical, Faure was married to writer Lucie Meyer. In 1978, he was elected to the Académie Française.

==Life==
Faure was born in Béziers, Hérault, to a French Army doctor. He was nearsighted yet a brilliant student since his youth, earning a baccalauréat at 15, as well as a law degree at 19 in Paris. At 21 years of age he became a member of the bar association, the youngest lawyer in France to do so at the time. While living in Paris, he became active in Third Republic politics; he joined the Radical Party in 1929.
During the German occupation of World War II, he joined the French Resistance in the Maquis. In 1942, he fled to Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s headquarters in Algiers, where he was made head of the Provisional Government of the Republic&#x27;s legislative department. At the end of the war, he served as French counsel for the prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials.

In 1946, he was elected to the French Parliament as a Radical. While the popularity of his party declined to less than 10% of the total vote, none of the other parties was able to gain a clear majority. Therefore, early on, his party often played a disproportionately important role in the formation of governments. He thus led the cabinet in 1952 and from 1955 to 1956. Faure was a leader of the more conservative wing of the party, opposing the party&#x27;s left, under Pierre Mendès France.

Faure&#x27;s views changed during the Fourth Republic; after initial opposition to the Fifth Republic (he voted against presidential election by universal suffrage in the 1962 referendum), he eventually became a Gaullist. The Gaullist Party, the Union for the New Republic, sent him on an unofficial mission to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1963. In government he served in successive ministries: Agriculture (1966–1968), National Education (1968–1969, where he was responsible for pushing through reform of the universities) and Social Affairs (1972–1973). He declined to be a candidate at the 1974 presidential election, in which he supported Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing against the Gaullist candidate, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.

He had the reputation of a careerist and the nickname of &quot;weathercock&quot;. He replied with humour, &quot;it is not the weathercock which turns; it is the wind!&quot;

He was a member of the National Assembly for the Jura department from 1946 to 1958, as well as for the Doubs department from 1967 to 1980. He presided over the National Assembly from 1973 to 1978. He sought another term as President of the Assembly President in 1978 but was defeated by Chaban-Delmas. Faure was a Senator from 1959 to 1967 for Jura and again, in 1980, for Doubs. In 1978, he became a member of the Académie Française.

On the regional, departmental and local levels, Edgar Faure was Mayor of Port-Lesney, Jura from 1947 to 1971 and again from 1983 to 1988, as well as Mayor of Pontarlier between 1971 and 1977; he served as President of the General Council of the Jura department from 1949 to 1967, then member of the General Council of the Doubs from 1967 to 1979, President of the Regional Council of Franche-Comté (1974–1981, 1982–1988). He played a key role during the creation and first years of the Assembly of European Regions (AER), becoming his first president in 1985 and staying in that position until 1988.

<doc id="145263" wikidata="Q193427" url="?curid=145263" title="Air gun">
<text>An air gun or airgun is a gun that uses energy from compressed air or other gases that are mechanically pressurized and then released to propel and accelerate projectiles, similar to the principle of the primitive blowgun. This is in contrast to a firearm, which shoots projectiles using energy generated via exothermic combustion (detonation) of chemical propellants, most often black powder or smokeless powder.

Air guns come in both long gun (air rifle) and handgun (air pistol) forms. Both types typically propel metallic projectiles that are either diabolo-shaped pellets or spherical shots called BBs, although in recent years Minié ball-shaped cylindro-conoidal projectiles called slugs are gaining more popularity. Certain types of air guns (usually air rifles) may also launch fin-stabilized projectile such as darts (e.g., tranquilizer guns) or hollow-shaft arrows (so-called &quot;airbows&quot;).

The first air guns were developed as early as the 16th century, and have since been used in hunting, shooting sport and even in warfare. There are three different power sources for modern air guns, depending on the design: spring-piston, pneumatic or bottled compressed gas (most commonly carbon dioxide and recently nitrogen).

==History==

Air guns represent the oldest pneumatic technology. The oldest existing mechanical air gun dates back to about 1580, and is in the Livrustkammaren Museum in Stockholm. This is approximately what most historians recognize as the beginning of the modern air gun.

Throughout 17th to 19th century, air guns in .30 to .51 calibers were used to hunt big game, deer and wild boar. These air rifles were charged using a pump to fill an air reservoir and gave velocities from . They were also used in warfare, the most recognized example being the Girandoni air rifle.

At that time, they had compelling advantages over the primitive firearms of the day. For example, air guns could be discharged in wet weather and rain (unlike both matchlock and flintlock muskets), and discharged much faster than muzzle-loading guns. Moreover, they were quieter than a firearm of a similar caliber, had no muzzle flash, and were smokeless. Thus, they did not disclose the shooter&#x27;s position or obscure the shooter&#x27;s view, unlike the black powder muskets of the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the hands of skilled soldiers, they gave the military a distinct advantage. France, Austria and other nations had special sniper detachments using air rifles. The Austrian 1770 model was named &quot;Windbüchse&quot; (literally &quot;wind rifle&quot; in German). The gun was developed in 1768 or 1769 by the Tyrolean watchmaker, mechanic and gunsmith Bartholomäus Girandoni (1744–1799) and is sometimes referred to as the Girandoni air rifle or Girandoni air gun in literature (the name is also spelled &quot;Girandony&quot;, &quot;Giradoni&quot; or &quot;Girardoni&quot;.) The &quot;Windbüchse&quot; was about long and weighed , about the same size and mass as a conventional musket. The air reservoir was a removable, club-shaped, butt. The &quot;Windbüchse&quot; carried twenty-two .51 caliber (13 mm) lead balls in a tubular magazine. A skilled shooter could fire off one magazine in about thirty seconds. A shot from this air gun could penetrate a wooden board at a hundred paces, an effect roughly equal to that of a modern 9×19mm or .45 ACP caliber pistol.

Circa 1820, the Japanese inventor Kunitomo Ikkansai developed various manufacturing methods for guns, and also created an air gun based on the study of Western knowledge (&quot;rangaku&quot;) acquired from the Dutch in Dejima.
The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804) carried a reservoir air gun. It held 22 .46 caliber round balls in a tubular magazine mounted on the side of the barrel. The butt served as the air reservoir and had a working pressure of . The rifle was said to be capable of 22 aimed shots per minute and had a rifled bore of and a groove diameter .

One of the first commercially successful and mass-produced air guns was manufactured by the William F. Markham&#x27;s Markham Air Rifle Company in Plymouth, Michigan, US. Their first model air gun was the wooden &quot;Challenger&quot;, marketed in 1886. In response, Clarence Hamilton from the neighboring Plymouth Air Rifle Company (later renamed to Daisy Manufacturing Company in 1895) marketed their all-metal Daisy BB Gun in early 1888, which prompted Markham to respond with their &quot;Chicago&quot; model in 1888 followed by the &quot;King&quot; model in 1890. The &quot;Chicago&quot; model was sold by Sears, Roebuck for 73 cents in its catalog. In 1928, the name of the Markham company was changed to King Air Rifle Company after the company was purchased by Daisy in 1916 after decades of intense competition, and continued to manufacture the &quot;King&quot; model air rifle until 1935 before ceasing operation altogether in the 1940s.

From the 1890s onwards, air rifles were used in Birmingham, England for competitive target shooting. Matches were held in public houses and working men&#x27;s clubs, which sponsored shooting teams. This often took the form of Bell Target shooting, where the competitor aims to ring a bell by shooting through a small hole in a steel plate. Prizes, such as a leg of mutton for the winning team, were paid for by the losing team. During this time, over 4,000 air rifle clubs and associations existed across Great Britain, with as many as 1,600 in Birmingham alone. During this time, the air gun was associated with poaching because it could deliver a shot without a significant muzzle report.

Air guns are used for hunting (small to medium game), pest control, recreational shooting (commonly known as plinking) and competitive sports such as the Olympic 10 m air rifle and 10 m air pistol events. Field target (FT) is a competitive form of metallic silhouette shooting in which the targets are animal-shaped steel targets with a &quot;kill zone&quot; cut-out. Hunter field target (HFT) is a variation, using identical equipment, but with differing rules. The distances FT and HFT competitions are shot at range between for HFT &amp; for FT, with varying sizes of &quot;reducers&quot; being used to increase or decrease the size of the kill zone. In the UK, competition power limits are set at the legal maximum for an unlicensed air rifle, i.e. . Air rifle benchrest is an international shooting sport where the objective is to hit a (small) bulls eye target at shooting distance. There are two divisions ARLV and ARHV .

The increasing affordability of higher-power pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) rifles has allowed large projectiles and further target distance for competition purposes. For instance, the Extreme Benchrest competition held annually in Green Valley, Arizona allows calibers up to at 75 yd (68.58 m) while the Big Bore Benchrest arm of the same competition at other localities engages targets at .

== Powerplant ==
The component of an airgun that provides the gas pressure needed to propel projectiles is called its &quot;powerplant&quot;, which uses internally stored pressurized gas; and &quot;compressed gas&quot; (most commonly CO2), which uses external sources of pressurized gas.

=== Spring-piston ===

A spring-piston air gun (also known as a spring gun or simply a &quot;springer&quot;) operates by means of a spring-loaded piston pump assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Traditionally, a grease-lubricated steel coil spring is used as the powerplant main spring. Before shooting, the user needs to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly, which pulls the pump piston rearwards and compresses the main spring until the rear of the piston engages the sear. When shooting, the trigger is pulled and disengages the sear, allowing the main spring to decompress and release its stored elastic potential energy, pushing the piston forward, thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder. Because the pump outlet (located to the front of the pump) is directly behind the pellet seated in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome the static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as &quot;dieseling&quot;, where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g., petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the compression heat like in a diesel engine, and lead to an afterburner effect with (often unpredictable) additional thrusts. This often results in combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle and potential pressure damage to the rubber O-ring seals inside the gun. Dieseling can be made to occur &quot;intentionally&quot; to increase power, by coating the pellet with lubricant or petroleum jelly, although this may result in damage to the breech seal.

Most spring-piston guns are single-shot breechloaders by nature, but multiple-shot repeaters with magazine feeders have been introduced in recent years by manufacturers such as Gamo, Umarex and Hatsan.
Spring-piston guns, especially the high-powered &quot;magnum&quot; guns, are able to achieve muzzle velocities exceeding the speed of sound. The effort required for the cocking stroke is proportional to the designed power of the gun, with higher muzzle velocities requiring a stiffer spring and hence a greater cocking effort. Spring-piston guns have a practical upper limit of for .177 cal (4.5 mm) pellets, as higher velocities cause unstable pellet flight and loss of accuracy. This is due to the extreme buffeting caused when the pellet reaches and surpasses transonic speed, then slows back down and goes through sound barrier again, which is more than enough to destabilize the pellet&#x27;s flight. Shortly after leaving the barrel, the supersonic pellet falls back below the speed of sound and the shock wave overtakes the pellet, causing its flight stability to be disrupted. Drag increases disproportionately as pellet velocity increases, so it is generally better to increase pellet weight to keep velocities subsonic in high-powered guns. Many shooters find that velocities in the range offer an ideal balance between power and accuracy.

Spring guns are typically cocked by one of the following mechanisms:
* Break-barrel — like a break action firearm, the barrel is hinged at the junction with the receiver and is flexed downwards to expose the breech and serves as the cocking lever
* Fixed-barrel – the barrel is fixed to the receiver, and the cocking is done with a separate cocking lever
** Underlever – the cocking lever is located underneath the barrel or the receiver and is flexed downwards during cocking
** Sidelever – the cocking lever is located to the side (usually the right side) of the receiver and is flexed sideways during cocking
** Overlever – the cocking lever is located above the barrel and is flexed upwards during cocking, seen in some air pistols
* Motorized cocking powered by a rechargeable battery (rare)

Spring-piston guns, especially high-powered (&quot;magnum&quot;) models, do still recoil as a result of the mainspring pushing the piston forward. Although the recoil is less than that of some cartridge firearms, it can make the gun difficult to shoot accurately as the spring recoil is in effect while the pellet is still within the barrel. Spring gun recoil also has a sharp forward component, caused by the piston hitting the front end of the pump chamber when the spring has fully decompressed. These rapid double-jerking movements are known to damage scopes not rated for spring gun usage. In addition, the spring often has unpredictable collateral transverse vibrations as well as torquing, both of which can cause accuracy to suffer. These vibrations can be controlled by adding features like close-fitting spring guides or by aftermarket tuning done by gunsmiths who specialize in air gun modifications, a common one being the addition of high viscosity tenacious grease to the spring, which lubricates and serves to dampen vibration.

The better quality spring guns can have very long service lives, being simple to maintain and repair. Because they deliver the same mechanical energy output on each shot, external ballistics are quite consistent. Most Olympic air gun competitions through the 1970s and into the 1980s were shot with spring-piston guns, often of the opposing-piston recoil-eliminating type. Beginning in the 1980s, guns powered by compressed/liquefied carbon dioxide began to dominate the competition. Today, the guns used at the highest levels of competition are powered by compressed air.

==== Gas spring ====
Some newer generation air guns incorporate a gas spring (commonly referred to as a &quot;gas piston&quot;, &quot;gas ram&quot;, &quot;gas strut&quot; or &quot;nitro piston&quot;) instead of a mechanical spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlets and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts as a pneumatic accumulator. Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures within when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, no twisting torque (caused by coil spring expanding) exerted onto the gun, smoother recoil pattern and faster &quot;lock time&quot; (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged), which all result in more consistent accuracy. Gas springs perform more reliably in cold climates than coil springs, because metallic coil springs need to be coated with lubricating grease which often thickens in low temperatures causing the gun to &quot;freeze up&quot;. Gas springs also have less lateral and longitudinal vibrations than coil springs, hence are usually less &quot;hold-sensitive&quot;, making it easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.

=== Pneumatic ===

Pneumatic airguns propel the projectiles by utilizing the pneumatic potential energy within compressed air, which is pressurized beforehand and stored inside the gun, and then released through valves during shooting. Single-stroke and multi-stroke pump guns utilize an on-board hand pump to pressurize air in an internal reservoir tank, while pre-charged pneumatic guns&#x27; reservoirs are filled from an external source using either a high-pressure stand pump or by decanting air from a larger diving cylinder.

====Pump pneumatic====
Pump pneumatic air guns, or pump guns, use a lever-operated onboard air pump to pressurize an internal reservoir, and then discharge the stored compressed air during shooting. Depending on the design, pump guns can be either single-stroke or multi-stroke.

* In &quot;single-stroke&quot; pneumatic air guns (also known as &quot;single pump&quot;) a single motion of the cocking lever is all that is required to mechanically compress the air. The single-pump system has always dominated the casual plinking market, and is usually found in target rifles and pistols, where the higher muzzle energy of a multi-stroke pumping system is not required. Single-stroke pneumatic rifles dominated the national and international ISSF 10 metre air rifle shooting events from the 1970s to the 1990s, until being outperformed by the introduction of pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) guns (discussed below).
* &quot;Multi-stroke&quot; pneumatic air guns (also known as &quot;multi-pump&quot;) use multiple pumpings to achieve variable power levels in order to adapt for both long or short-range shooting. These air guns are usually single-shot, where each shot requires approximately 5 strokes. However, up to five shots are possible, usually requiring approximately 10 to 20 strokes, as long as the air reservoir is capable of storing higher pressure. For safety reasons, most multi-stroke guns are usually designed to have their pump lever jam when the reservoir has reached its maximum pressure limit, so the user can no longer pump the gun until it&#x27;s discharged. The maximum pressure limit for the reservoir is approximately 20 to 30 strokes.

====Pre-charged pneumatic====
Pre-charged pneumatic air guns or PCP have their internal reservoir pre-filled from an external air source (such as a diving cylinder or air compressor, or by manual charging with a high-pressure stand pump), and remain pressurized until depleted after repeated shooting. During shooting, the hammer strikes the reservoir&#x27;s release valve, allowing a set volume of the pressurized air to be discharged into the chamber and propel the projectile. Depending on the release valve design, PCP air guns can be categorized into two types – &quot;unregulated&quot; and &quot;regulated&quot; (which has either a mechanical or electronic regulator valve). In addition to compressed air, custom PCP models using compressed pure nitrogen and even compressed helium have also been recently developed.
Because of the need for cylinders or charging systems, PCP guns have higher initial costs but much lower operating costs when compared to CO2 rifles, and have superior performance over ordinary pump guns. Having no significant movement of heavy mechanical parts during the discharge cycle, PCP airgun designs produce lower recoil, and can shoot as many as 100 shots per charge depending on the tank/reservoir size. The ready supply of air has allowed the development of semi- and fully automatic air guns. PCP guns are very popular in Europe because of their accuracy and ease of use. They are widely utilized in ISSF 10 meter air pistol and rifle shooting events and the sport of Field Target shooting, and are usually fitted with telescopic sights.

Early stand pump designs encountered problems of fatigue (both human and mechanical), temperature warping, and condensation – none of which are beneficial to accurate shooting or the airguns&#x27; longevity. Modern stand pumps have multi-stage chambers and built-in air filtration systems and have overcome many of these problems. Using scuba-quality air decanted from a diving cylinder provides consistently clean, dry, high-pressure air.

During the typical PCP&#x27;s discharge cycle, the hammer of the rifle is released by the sear to strike the bash valve. The hammer may move rearwards or forwards, unlike firearms where the hammer almost always moves forward. The valve is held closed by a spring and the pressure of the air in the reservoir. The pressure of the spring is constant, and the pressure of the air released (which is also known as the &quot;working pressure&quot;) decreases with each successive shot. As a result, when the reservoir pressure is high, the valve opens less fully and closes faster than when the reservoir pressure is lower, resulting in a similar total volume of air flowing past the valve with each shot. This results in a degree of partial self-regulation that gives a greater consistency of velocity from shot to shot, which corresponds to the middle &quot;plateau&quot; phase of the gun&#x27;s shot-to-shot muzzle velocity profile (also known as the &quot;power curve&quot; ). Well-designed PCP will display good shot-to-shot consistency over a long period, as the air reservoir is being depleted.

Other PCP rifles and pistols are regulated, i.e. the firing valve operates within a secondary chamber separated from the main air reservoir by the regulator body. The regulator maintains the pressure within this secondary chamber at a set pressure (lower than the main reservoir&#x27;s) until the main reservoir&#x27;s pressure drops to the point where it can no longer do so. As a result, shot-to-shot consistency is maintained for longer than in an unregulated rifle, and the gun can also output more shots due to reduced waste of reservoir pressure.

=== Compressed gas ===
Compressed gas guns, also known as &quot;CG guns,&quot; are essentially pneumatic airguns utilizing detachable pressure reservoirs in the form of prefilled external gas cylinders (often with built-in regulator valves), and are commonly referred to as &quot;CO2 guns&quot; due to the ubiquitous commercial use of bottled liquid carbon dioxide. However, more recent high-end models sometimes use larger compressed air/nitrogen (known as HPA or &quot;N2&quot;) cylinders, which have higher operating pressures and better thermal stability.

==== CO2 ====
CO2 guns, like other pneumatic guns using compressed air, offer power for repeated shots in a compact package without the need for complex pumping or filling mechanisms. The ability to store power for repeated shots also means that repeating arms are possible. There are many replica revolvers and semi-automatic pistols on the market that use CO2 power. Most CO2 guns use a disposable cylinder called a &quot;Powerlet&quot; cartridge, that is often purchased with of pressurized CO2 gas, although some, usually more expensive models, use larger refillable CO2 reservoirs like those typically used with paintball markers.

CO2 guns are popular for training, as the guns and ammunition are inexpensive, relatively safe to use, and no specialized facilities are needed for safety. In addition, they can be purchased and owned in areas where firearms possession is either strictly controlled or banned outright. Most CO2 powered guns are relatively inexpensive, and there are a few precision target guns available that use CO2.

==== High-pressure air ====
High-pressure air (HPA) system, or &quot;N2&quot;, was originally developed for paintball markers as a replacement for CO2 cartridges, and uses Powerlet interface-compatible diving cylinders filled with either pure nitrogen or compressed air (which is 78% nitrogen). Because nitrogen is more inert than CO2, it remains in the gaseous state longer when compressed; when it expands, it cools due to the Joule-Thomson effect but at a far lower rate than liquid CO2 because there is no change in state from liquid to gas. This thermostability reduces the variation in output pressure associated with rapid successions of firing cycles, improving accuracy and reliability in extreme climates. However, because compressed air is stored at higher pressures (up to ) than liquid CO2 (stored at around ), HPA cylinders are more expensive. Cylinders smaller than may not even last as long as a standard CO2 cartridge when subjected to frequent uses.

It is also possible to power an HPA-compatible gun directly from a plug-in air compressor without using a gas cylinder, though this type of setup is rare.

====Air cartridge system====
First developed in the United Kingdom during the 1980s as the Saxby-Palmer Ensign, and then by Brocock as the &quot;Brocock Air Cartridge System&quot; (BACS) and later into the &quot;Tandem Air Cartridge&quot; (TAC), this variation of the pre-charged pneumatic design have no pressure reservoir built into the gun, but instead use removable and reusable metallic gas cylinders often known as &quot;Brocock cartridges&quot; after its British manufacturer. Each air cartridge is essentially a self-contained gas reservoir housed inside a cartridge case (usually in the size of a .38 Special), with an internal bash valve designed to release the content when the base of the cartridge is struck. Prior to shooting, each cartridge is pre-filled with sufficient compressed air for one shot (typically via a multi-stroke hand pump) and has a .177/.22 caliber pellet pre-seated to its front slot, and the entire cartridge is then inserted into a chamber in the gun barrel. When shooting, the hammer hits the rear of the air cartridge, mimicking the function of a centerfire ammunition. This allows the airgun to be constructed and operated in similar fashions to genuine firearms. It also allows for higher shot consistency because each cartridge can be easily filled to an identical air charge, essentially removing the &quot;power curve&quot; of conventional PCP guns and bypassing any need for regulators. It also simplifies the magazine feed design and eliminates the risk of deforming the projectiles when the action seats each pellet, as the soft lead pellet is protected from contact with the action probe by the harder cartridge casing.

The air cartridge system, both in the rifle and revolver forms, was at the peak of its popularity throughout the 1990s. The popularity of the Brocock range was such that, by 2002, estimates put the number of air cartridge guns in circulation around 70,000-80,000. However, a small number of incidents relating to the alleged illegal conversion of (mainly) Brococks to allow them to discharge live ammunition sparked a media frenzy. In early 2002, the BBC reported that figures from the National Criminal Intelligence Service showed converted Brococks accounted for 35 per cent of all guns recovered by the police, and David McCrone, firearms adviser to the Association of Chief Police Officers and Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; &quot;there is evidence which would justify banning them&quot;. After the UK government implemented the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 in January 2004, it became illegal to possess such airguns without a firearm certificate in the United Kingdom. Brocock subsequently ceased production of all air cartridge systems and turned to focus primarily on PCP airguns.

==Ammunition==
===Pellet===

The most popular ammunition used in rifled air guns is made of lead, a heavy metal. Lead is highly poisonous (whether inhaled or swallowed), affecting almost every organ and system in the human body. For this reason, lead-free pellets are becoming increasingly popular, and are available in all major shapes and styles, just like traditional lead pellets.

By far the most popular shape is the wasp-waisted diabolo pellet, which has two sections – a solid front portion called the &quot;head&quot;, which contains the center of mass and is available in a variety of shapes and styles such as flat (wadcutter), round (domed), cone-shaped (pointed) and pitted (hollow point); and a hollowed, thin-walled conical rear portion called the &quot;skirt&quot;, which expands and fully engages the bore to provide a good seal and thus allows maximal efficiency in pellet propulsion during shooting. In flight, the skirt has greater drag-to-weight ratio than the head and exerts a rearward pull behind the center of mass, similar to that of a shuttlecock. This produces a phenomenon known as &quot;drag stabilization&quot;, which helps to counteract yawing and maintain a consistent flight path. However, the diabolo shape also means that the overall pellet will have poor ballistic coefficient and tends to lose energy quickly and be more unstable especially in the transonic region (272–408 m/s ~ 893–1340 ft/s).
Diabolo pellets are conventionally made from lead, but are widely available in non-lead alternatives, such as tin, or a combination of materials such as steel or gold alloys with polymer tips. A variety of lead-free pellets are offered by all major pellet manufacturers, including H&amp;N Sport, RWS, JSB, Gamo, and others. Since lead is very dense, it has a higher ballistic coefficient than lightweight alternatives such as tin, copper, or plastic. At the present time, the airgun industry does not mass-produce dense alternatives to lead with a high ballistic coefficient for long-range shooting.

==== Slug ====
Some manufacturers also have recently introduced the more cylindro-conoidal-shaped &quot;slug&quot; pellets for the more powerful modern PCP air rifles. Compared to the commonly used diabolo pellets, these slug pellets resemble cast bullets and have more contact surface with the bore and hence need greater propelling force to overcome friction, but have better aerodynamics, ballistic coefficient, and longer effective ranges due to the more aerodynamic shape, however they also require a fully rifled barrel for spin stabilization in flight. Appropriately sized bullets cast from firearm bullet molds can be used in big bore air rifles.
Caution should be used when handling lead projectiles or preparing animals for food, as lead fragments can be easily missed inside the meat. Lead-free slugs in airgun calibers are gradually being developed and becoming available for purchase from manufacturers such as Zan Projectiles, due in part to regulations on hunting with lead projectiles in many areas.

===BB===
The BB shot was once the most common airgun ammunition in the US, thanks to the popularity of Daisy&#x27;s line of BB airguns. A BB is a small metallic ball in 4.5 mm/.177&quot; diameter, typically made of steel (with a copper or zinc coating) or lead. Originally called the &quot;round shot&quot;, the contemporary name came from the &quot;BB&quot;- size lead birdshot used in shotgun shells, which the first BB gun invented in 1886 was designed to shoot. Steel BBs can be acceptably accurate at short distances when fired from properly designed BB guns with smoothbore barrels. Lead #3 buckshot pellets can be used in .25&quot; caliber airguns as if they were large BBs.

Due to the hardness of the steel, steel BBs cannot &quot;take&quot; to rifled barrels, which is why they are undersized (4.4 mm ball against 4.5 mm bore) to allow them to be used in .177&quot; rifled barrels, which when used in this configuration can in effect be considered smoothbore, but with a poorer gas-seal, and if 4.5 mm diameter BBs are used, they would jam in the bore. Therefore, steel BBs lack the spin stabilization required for long-range accuracy, and usage in any but the cheapest rifled guns is discouraged. The softer lead BBs, however, can be used in rifled barrels.

Typically BBs are used for indoor practice, casual outdoor plinking, training children, or to save money, as they are significantly cheaper than pellets. Replica pistols allow people to train with a BB gun, saving a lot of money to centerfire firearm cartridges. Care should be exercised to avoid ricochet, and safety glasses are recommended. Recently, manufacturers have created frangible BBs, which break apart and do not ricochet, reducing the hazards associated with BB guns.

Some shotgunners use sightless BB rifles to train in instinctive shooting. Similar guns were also used briefly by the United States Army in a Vietnam-era instinctive shooting program called &quot;Quick Kill&quot;.

===Darts and arrows===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, air gun darts were popular, largely because they could be reused. Although less popular now, several different types of darts are made to be used in air guns, but it is not recommended that darts be used in air guns with rifled bores or in spring-powered air guns. Air guns that shoot darts are sometimes called &quot;dart guns&quot;, and &quot;tranquilizer guns&quot; if the darts used are loaded with anesthetic (tranquilizer) compounds.

Some modern air guns are designed to discharge arrows and are called &quot;arrow guns&quot; or sometimes &quot;airbows&quot;. These arrows are designed with a hollow shaft that is open in the rear where the nock would normally be. When loaded, the hollow arrow shaft is slid rearwards over a barrel whose external diameter is only fractionally smaller than the shaft&#x27;s interior diameter, providing a close-enough fitting that minimizes rattling and gives a reasonable enveloping seal without causing too much friction. During shooting, the trigger releases high-pressure air from the barrel to the front portion of the hollow arrow shaft, pushing the arrow forward. Such air guns can shoot arrows at launch velocities rivalling or even exceeding high-end crossbows, while retaining consistency of precision unaffected by archer&#x27;s paradox, but they are also more expensive to set up and maintain.

=== Laser beam ===
The modern pentathlon has since 2009 included a laser-run event that replaced the traditional cross country run of 3,200 metres and timed air-pistol shoot. The competitors run 4 laps of 800 m combined with 4 rounds of firing. The pistols used are modified air pistols that fire an eye-safe laser beam towards a target at the same time as a discharge of air. This has made the organisation of the events easier from a safety point of view and allows competitors to travel more easily with their weapons.

===Airsoft pellets===
Airsoft pellets are plastic BBs shot from airsoft guns.

==Calibers==
The most common air gun calibers are
* .177 (4.5 mm): the most common caliber. Mandated by the ISSF for use in international target shooting competition at 10m, up to Olympic level in both rifle and pistol events. It has also been adopted by most National Governing Bodies for domestic use in similar target shooting events. It has the flattest trajectory of all the calibers for a given energy level. At suitable energy levels it can be used effectively for hunting.
* .22 (5.5 mm &amp; 5.6 mm): for hunting and general use. In recent years air rifles and pistols in .22&quot; (and some other calibers) have been allowed for use in both domestic and international target shooting in events not controlled by the ISSF. Most notably in FT/HFT and Smallbore Benchrest competitions. These events often allow the use of any caliber air gun, up to a maximum which is often .22&quot;, rather than a fixed caliber.

Other less common traditional calibers include:
* .20 (5 mm): initially proprietary to the Sheridan multi-pump pneumatic air rifle, later more widely used. 
* .25 (6.35 mm): the largest commonly available caliber for most of the 20th century.
* .30 (7.62 mm): the current largest available for non-PCP powered airguns

Larger caliber air rifles suitable for hunting large animals are offered by major manufacturers. These are usually PCP guns. The major calibers available are:
* .357 (9mm)
* .45 (11.43 mm)
* .50 (12.7 mm)
* .58 (14.5 mm)
* .72 (18.28 mm)

Custom air guns are available in even larger calibers such as 20 mm (0.79&quot;) or .87 (22.1 mm).

== Legislation ==

While in some countries air guns are not subject to any specific regulation, in most, there are laws which differ widely. Each jurisdiction has its definition of an air gun. Regulations may vary for weapons of different bore, muzzle energy, velocity, or ammunition material. Guns designed to fire metal pellets are often more tightly controlled than airsoft weapons. There may be a minimum age for possession, and sales of both air guns and ammunition may be restricted. Some areas require permits and background checks similar to those required for propellant type firearms.

==Safety and misuse==
While historical air guns have been made specifically for warfare, modern air guns can also be deadly. In medical literature, modern air guns have been noted as a cause of death. This has been the case for guns of caliber .177 and .22 that are within the legal muzzle energy of air guns in the United Kingdom.

For reason of safety and security a rule of use of the safety flag has been strictly mentioned by ISSF for the 10m air pistol and rifle shooting sports events.

<text>.177 caliber or 4.5 mm caliber is the smallest diameter of pellets and BB shots widely used in air guns, and is the only caliber generally accepted for formal target competition. It is also sometimes used for hunting small game, like fowl. It is also used in field target competitions, where it competes with .20 caliber (5 mm) and .22 caliber (5.6 mm) rifles.

Steel BBs are typically slightly smaller than lead BBs at diameter, although the bore diameter of the barrel are the same. Some air guns are designed to accept .177 pellets, .177 lead shot, or .175 steel BBs interchangeably.

==Relationship between caliber and trajectory ==
If two guns fire pellets of different weights, the gun firing the lighter pellet must fire it at a higher velocity to achieve the same muzzle energy. This is an important consideration in locations where air guns are legally restricted by muzzle energy. Because a .177 pellet is lighter than a larger caliber pellet of similar design, the .177 pellet can be propelled faster and therefore on a flatter trajectory, without exceeding the legal limit on energy. However, because the lighter projectile has a lower ballistic coefficient, it loses its initial energy to air resistance faster than a heavier, slower pellet. Therefore, a heavier pellet (typically of a larger caliber) may be preferred for hunting.

<doc id="145272" wikidata="Q209055" url="?curid=145272" title="Torquay">
<text>Torquay ( ) is a seaside town in Devon, England, part of the unitary authority area of Torbay. It lies south of the county town of Exeter and east-north-east of Plymouth, on the north of Tor Bay, adjoining the neighbouring town of Paignton on the west of the bay and across from the fishing port of Brixham. In 2011 the built-up area of Torquay had a population of 65,245.

The town&#x27;s economy, like Brixham&#x27;s, was initially based upon fishing and agriculture; however, in the early 19th century, it began to develop into a fashionable seaside resort. Later, as the town&#x27;s fame spread, it was popular with Victorian society. Renowned for its mild climate (at least for England), the town earned the nickname the English Riviera.

The writer Agatha Christie was born in the town and lived at Ashfield in Torquay during her early years. There is an &quot;Agatha Christie Mile&quot;, a tour with plaques dedicated to her life and work.

The poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning lived in the town from 1837 to 1841. This was on the recommendation of her doctor in an attempt to cure her of a disease; the disease is thought likely to have been tuberculosis. Her former home now forms part of the Regina Hotel in Vaughan Parade.

==Name==
Torquay&#x27;s name originates in its being the quay of the ancient village of Torre. In turn, Torre takes its name from the tor, the extensively quarried remains of which can be seen by the town&#x27;s Lymington Road. The original name was thus Torrequay, then Torkay, Torkey and Tor Quay, before the words were joined in Torquay.

==History==

The area comprising modern Torquay has been inhabited since Paleolithic times. Hand axes found in Kents Cavern have been dated as 40,000 years old, and a maxilla fragment, known as Kents Cavern 4, may be the oldest example of a modern human in Europe, dating back to 37,000–40,000 years ago.

Roman soldiers are known to have visited Torquay during the period when Britain was a part of the Roman Empire, leaving offerings at a curious rock formation in Kents Cavern, known as &quot;The Face&quot;.

The first major building in Torquay was Torre Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery founded in 1196. Torquay remained a minor settlement until the Napoleonic wars, when Torbay was used as a sheltered anchorage by the Channel Fleet, and relatives of officers often visited Torquay. The mild climate (for the UK) attracted many visitors who considered the town a convalescence retreat where they could recover from illness away from the cold and cloudy winters of more northerly or easterly locations. The population of Torquay grew rapidly from 838 in 1801, to 24,767 in 1887.
The second phase in the expansion of Torquay began when Torre railway station was opened on 18 December 1848. The improved transport connections resulted in rapid growth at the expense of nearby towns not on Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s railways. The more central Torquay railway station was opened on 2 August 1859 with views of the sea from the platforms. After the growth of the preceding decades, Torquay was granted borough status in 1892.

Torquay Tramways operated electric street trams from 1907. They were initially powered by the unusual Dolter stud-contact electrification so as not to disfigure the town with overhead wires, but in 1911, was converted to more conventional overhead-line supply. The line was extended into Paignton in 1911 but the network was closed in 1934.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#x27;s Torquay Lifeboat Station was at the Ladies Bathing Cove from 1876 until 1923. A second lifeboat was kept at the harbour from 1917 until 1928. Torquay was regarded as a &quot;Spa Town&quot; after the Marine Spa was built on Beacon Hill near the harbour. Originally called the &quot;Bath Saloons complex&quot;, it had an open air tide-filled swimming bath. The complex was opened in 1853 after Beacon Hill headland was dynamited to make space for it. Charles Dickens was said to have made readings there.

During World War I, military hospitals were sited in Torquay – many survivors from the Battle of Gallipoli recuperated in the town – and it was used as a troop staging area. In September 1915, King George V and Queen Mary visited.
During World War II Torquay was regarded as safer than the towns of South East England, and played host to evacuees from the London area. The town did, however, suffer minor bomb damage during the war, mainly from planes dumping excess loads after participating in the Plymouth Blitz. The last air raid on Torquay took place on 29 May 1944, shortly before the D-Day landings in June and, in the months leading up to D-Day, thousands of US Army personnel arrived with the 3204th Quartermaster Service Company billeted in Chelston and Cockington. During Operation Overlord more than 23,000 men of the American 4th Infantry Division departed Torquay for Utah Beach. The loading ramps used by the American army are still visible in front of the Regina Hotel on Vaughan Parade.

The water sport events of the 1948 Summer Olympic Games were held in Torquay, and the Olympic flame brought from London to Torre Abbey Gardens. Although it did not host any Olympic events for the 2012 Summer Olympics, with the sailing taking place in Weymouth, Torbay looked to host teams as a preparation camp and the flame passed through once more on its route around the UK.
After World War II several private high-rise blocks of flats were constructed above the Rock Walk cliffs and harbour, giving the area a Monte Carlo feel.
In 1971, after a tragedy, the Marine Spa was demolished to make way for the ill-fated Coral Island leisure complex. This was characterised by its concrete arches on its uppermost floor and sunbathing decks like those of a cruise liner. The site featured a hexagonal outdoor plunge pool surrounded by sunbathing terraces leading down to Beacon Cove beach. Inside the building were several lounges, a restaurant and a nightclub within the arches of the ancient swimming bath. All levels were served by a hydraulic passenger lift. Coral Island opened in 1977, and closed in 1988. The complex was demolished in 1997, 20 years after its construction. The site remained derelict until 2002 when the Living Coasts coastal zoo was built there.

Torquay also boasted rehabilitation facilities for the blind at America Lodge, which was owned by the RNIB for a number of decades. Like many RNIB properties, this was sold off in the 1990s and the building was subdivided into private apartments.

In the late 1980s, Fleet Street was rebuilt as the Fleet Walk shopping centre which has street-level shops and an upper-level shopping deck. The long, curved building which follows the street is magnolia-coloured and in mock Victorian style. In the late 1990s and early 2000s new pubs and night clubs opened around the harbour, leading to an increase in binge drinking; however, in recent years a better police presence and responsible drinks promotions have improved the situation.

Areas around Torquay have also been affected by either refurbishments or closure. For instance, the Rock Walk located on the town&#x27;s seafront was refurbished through a £3 million funding project, resulting in its reopening on 3 October 2010, as part of the Royal Terrace Gardens festival. In 2013, the Torquay Pavilion was closed after a loss in funding and attempts to reopen it under new funding are ongoing.

==Governance==
There is only one tier of local government covering Torquay, being the unitary authority of Torbay, which covers a larger area than just Torquay, also including Paignton and Brixham. Torbay Council is based in Torquay, having its headquarters at Torquay Town Hall.

Historically, Torquay was in the ancient parish of Tormoham. Until 1835 the parish was controlled by the landowners and the vestry, in the same way as most rural areas. More urban forms of local government began in 1835 when improvement commissioners were appointed for the parish. The unelected commissioners were replaced in 1850 with an elected local board. One of the local board&#x27;s first projects was to build a town hall on Union Street, which was completed in 1852.

In May 1876 the Tormoham Local Board voted to change its name to the Torquay Local Board, acknowledging that Torquay was by then the more commonly-used name for the town; it was said that having a different official name had been causing confusion. In 1892, Torquay was made a municipal borough, governed by a corporate body officially called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Torquay&quot;, but generally known as the corporation or the town council.

The borough was enlarged in 1900 to take in the neighbouring parish of St Marychurch and the Chelston area from the neighbouring parish of Cockington. The rest of Cockington was absorbed into the borough in 1928. In 1911 a new town hall was built at Castle Circus.

In 1968 the borough of Torquay, the urban districts of Paignton and Brixham, and the parish of Churston Ferrers were all abolished. A county borough called Torbay was created to cover the whole area (with some adjustments of the boundaries to neighbouring parishes at the same time). As a county borough, Torbay was administratively independent from Devon County Council. Six years later, in 1974, local government was reformed again, with Torbay becoming a non-metropolitan district and Devon County Council providing county-level services to the area again. Torbay regained its independence from the county council in 1998 when it was made a unitary authority. Torbay remains part of the ceremonial county of Devon for the purposes of lieutenancy.
Torquay (along with part of Paignton) is in the Torbay parliamentary constituency, created in 1974; previous to that, it was in its own eponymous constituency. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament, since 2024 Steve Darling of the Liberal Democrats.

==Geography==

Torquay is situated on the southwestern coast of England, forming one-third of Torbay, on the western side of the bay. It has a mild microclimate, with winters that tend to be mild and wet. A record high temperature of 31.5C was recorded on 14 July 2013, at 5:30 p.m.

The town is made up of a number of small settlements that amalgamated into the town of Torquay. The town&#x27;s historic core consists of Tormohun (also historically known as Tormoham), Wellswood, The Warberries, Upton and Ellacombe and is based upon what was once the holdings of the Palk family. In 1900, Chelston and Livermead, part of the Cockington estate owned by the Mallocks, were annexed by the town and this was followed by the absorption of the former borough of St Marychurch. In this period St Marychurch covered Plainmoor, Watcombe, Babbacombe and Kingskerswell.

Wellswood and the Lincombes were built up by wealthy Victorians who, influenced by their travels around the Mediterranean, built large villas with Italianate features and towers. There are many pine trees, Bay bushes and trees (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;), various palm tree species and &quot;Phormiums&quot;. Cabbage trees or &quot;Torbay Palms&quot; are a notable feature of the area; the trees were introduced into the area from New Zealand in 1820, and since then have flourished.

The main beaches of Torquay are Oddicombe Beach, Meadfoot Beach, Maidencombe, Watcombe, Babbacombe Beach, Anstey&#x27;s Cove, Redgate, Torre Abbey Sands, Corbyn Sands and Institute Beach and Hollacombe Beach. The first two of these held European Blue Flag status in 2012.

The Sticklepath fault line, which runs across Devon from Bideford Bay to Torquay, is one of many geological faults criss-crossing Torbay; the Babbacombe Cliff Railway takes advantage of one of these fault lines.

On the coast of Wellswood is London Bridge, a limestone arch which can be seen from a viewpoint on the South West Coast Path.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Torquay has two railway stations. Torquay railway station is situated near the sea, close to Torre Abbey Sands. Torre railway station is situated a little inland adjacent to the road leading to Newton Abbot. Not all trains stop at Torre. As of 2013, there were plans for station improvements at Torquay and Torre (and at Paignton) and to build a new station at Edginswell.

===Road===
Torquay is connected to the UK motorway network by the A380, which traces the outskirts of the town as Hellevoetsluis Way and Hamelin Way, leading to the A38 and the M5 at Exeter. The A3022 branches from the A380, leading into Torquay as Riviera Way, to the seafront as Newton Road and then Avenue Road, and then on to Paignton as Torbay Road. The A379 runs past the harbour to Babbacombe and St Marychurch, and then north along the coast to Teignmouth. Work on constructing a new dual carriageway on the outskirts of Torquay near the Kingskerswell end was completed in 2015 with a new junction between the A380 South Devon Highway and Torbay Ring Road.

===Bus===
The main bus operator in Torquay is Stagecoach South West. Its service 12 passes through Torquay – between Newton Abbot and Brixham, – while many other routes operate within the town. From 1919 to 1996 Devon General ran buses in Torquay. From 23 May 1965, introduction of the one-way traffic scheme required buses from Paignton to divert via Abbey Road.
==Religion==

&quot;For a summary of the 2001 census results on religion&quot;, see below, Demographics

Torquay has about 60 churches from a wide variety of Christian denominations. Central Church (Methodist and United Reformed Church) has a notable pierced screen wall facade. St Matthias&#x27;s Church, Wellswood, was built as a chapel-of-ease to St Mark&#x27;s, Torwood, in the 1850s and became a parish church in 1880. In the 1970s, the churches of St Mark and Holy Trinity were closed and in 1979, the vicar of St Matthias&#x27;s became rector of the parish of St Matthias, St Mark and Holy Trinity.

St Saviour&#x27;s Church and St Michael&#x27;s Chapel are medieval church buildings, now Anglican. St Saviour&#x27;s originally had no aisles but a north aisle was added in the 14th century. The tower is at the west end and early medieval in date. Over restoration was carried out both on the exterior and interior in 1849. The monuments include one in early Tudor style to Thomas Cary (d. 1567) and another to Thomas Ridgeway (d. 1604) which includes an alabaster effigy. The Chapel of St Michael is only 36 by 15 ft and its floor is the uneven surface of the rock on which it stands. The roof has a barrel vault and the windows are small. The 19th-century Anglican churches of Torquay include All Saints, Bamfylde Road (1884–90, architect John Loughborough Pearson), St John&#x27;s, Montpelier Terrace (1861–71, architect George Edmund Street), St Luke&#x27;s (1863, architect Sir Arthur Blomfield), St Mark&#x27;s, St Mark&#x27;s Road (1856–57, architect Anthony Salvin), St Mary Magdalene, Union Street (1846, architect Anthony Salvin), and St Michael, Pimlico (1877, architect Pritchard). Two Roman Catholic churches, both built in the 19th century and are listed buildings, in Torquay are the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Our Lady Help of Christians and St Denis Church.

The former St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian church (built in 1862) on Torwood Gardens Road closed in 1951, and after a time as a nightclub, was converted to private residences.

There is also a Christadelphian meeting hall in the town.

There is also an Islamic centre and mosque. A United Hebrew Congregation synagogue was closed in 2000, and the congregation dissolved.

==Economy==
===Tourism===


Torquay has numerous tourist attractions, including Kents Cavern, Britain&#x27;s most important Stone Age site, which was home to early humans for some 40,000 years. The floor is composed of several strata, with remains indicating the prehistoric coexistence there of humans and extinct animals. The Rev. J. McEnery explored the cave between 1825 and 1829, and put forth the coexistence theory. The cave was extensively explored from 1865 to 1880 by William Pengelly, who found evidence to support McEnery&#x27;s hypothesis. The caves have attracted many famous people, among them Agatha Christie, Beatrix Potter, King George V and Haile Selassie who was so impressed with his visit that he gave his guide, Leslie Powe a gold sovereign.

On the seafront between the Rock Walk and the Marina is the Victorian Pavilion (pictured). The adjacent &quot;Friends Fountain&quot; complements the Victorian architecture. Just to the side of the fountain in Princess Gardens, directly next to Princess Theatre, is the English Riviera Wheel; a 100 foot high wheel that offers a unique birds eye view of the English Riviera, overlooking Torquay Harbour from a rare perspective.

Torquay Museum, the oldest in Devon, was founded in 1844, by The Torquay Natural History Society. The museum contains extensive geology, natural science, archaeology and ethnography collections of international importance, including the oldest fossil evidence of modern man in north-west Europe. The story of the English Riviera Geopark is told through exhibitions about geology, fossils and archaeology including artefacts from Kents Cavern and other local archaeology. The museum has galleries dedicated to diverse topics such as the life of Agatha Christie, ancient Egypt, explorers and ecology. Another gallery displays replica historic farmhouse interiors.

In 1857, the Bath&#x27;s Saloons complex was built on the promontory overlooking Beacon Cove. This included a ballroom, concert hall and sunlit conservatory and private bathing facilities with, underneath, a large public swimming bath open to the sea. Living Coasts, a coastal zoo owned by Paignton Zoo, was later built on the site of the complex. The stone arches of the public bath were incorporated into the shop at Living Coasts. Development of the site as a marine animal exhibit was first proposed in early 1999 in response to a call from Torbay Council for submissions from interested parties. The project, developed by Kay Elliott architects, included an exhibit to house marine birds, rather than fish, due to the need to avoid duplicating the exhibits at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. The project was subsequently taken on by Paignton Zoo Environmental Park and named Living Coasts. It was announced in June 2020 that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was to close permanently.

Other attractions are the Babbacombe Model Village, which opened in 1963, the Babbacombe Theatre which opened in 1939 and the Princess Theatre. A large tethered balloon offering aerial views of the town operated for several years until it was destroyed by strong winds in January 2012.

From 1875, a number of potteries operated in Torquay, making Torquay pottery for both the tourist trade and the high-end retail market.

===Other===
Torquay was the home of Suttons Seeds until it relocated to the neighbouring town of Paignton in 1998, and Beverage Brands, the owners of the popular and controversial alcoholic brand WKD, was based in the town until 2011.

==Culture==

===Arts===

In the early years of British cinema, Torquay was home to two production companies, Cairns Torquay Films and Torquay And Paignton Photoplay Productions, who in 1920, produced a total of three films between them. 

Recently, Devon Films, based in Torquay, has established itself as the Bay&#x27;s latest film production company.

The Princess Theatre, which is by the side of the harbour, is owned by Torbay Council and operated by ATG (Ambassador Theatre Group). With about 1,500 seats, it is Torquay&#x27;s largest theatre and plays host to touring independent production companies. The Princess Theatre also holds weddings and other functions such as parties and large seminars. TOADS Theatre Company operates the Little Theatre in Meadfoot in the converted St Mark&#x27;s Church, hosting both the company&#x27;s own productions and those of visiting societies. Babbacombe Theatre is located on Babbacombe Downs and describes itself as having the longest-running summer season in the country, which lasts nine months.

Torbay Council, along with other local bodies, administers Creative Torbay, a website for local cultural organisations, creatives and artists to promote their work.

===Media===
Torquay&#x27; local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon, Heart West, and Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly known as Palm 105.5 and The Breeze), which has its studios in Lymington Road in Torquay.

Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Beacon Hill and the local relay TV transmitters.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Herald Express&quot;, which has been published since 1925, after a merger of two papers.

Past newspapers include the &quot;Torquay and Tor General Advertisor and Director&quot;, founded in 1839, which in 1853 became &quot;The Torquay Directory and South Devon Journal&quot; until 1949, finally becoming &quot;The South Devon Journal&quot;, which closed in 1973.

===Sport===
Torquay has a long history of holding sailing events and regattas due to the favourable easterly facing nature of the bay and its popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries. This tradition reached its height in 1948 when the water sport events of the 1948 Summer Olympics were held in Torquay, with the Olympic flame being transferred from London to Torre Abbey Gardens to reside throughout the event.

Torquay is represented in association football in the National League South by Torquay United F.C. The team plays their home matches at Plainmoor and made it on occasion to the third tier of the English football leagues, now known as League One. Torquay United were promoted from the Conference Premier after winning the play-off final at Wembley in June 2009. However, after a poor Football League Two campaign in the 13/14 season, Torquay United came last and were relegated back to the Conference Premier (now the National League). Torquay were relegated previously in 2007 from the Football League after 80 years of membership and spent two years playing in the Conference Premier; this downfall came just three years after promotion from the league&#x27;s basement division and ultimately led to a change in ownership of the club to a consortium of local businessmen and fans.

==Politics==
From 1974, when it was created, until 1997 Torbay constituency was a safe Conservative seat, but Liberal Democrat Adrian Sanders overturned spy writer Rupert Allason&#x27;s majority by just 12 votes in 1997, widened to 6,708 in 2001.

During the 2005 general election, the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, visited the town. However, Sanders retained the seat with 40.8% of the votes (19,317, down from 23,012 in 2001). A swing of 9.7% away from the Liberal Democrats was split between the Conservatives (with a 4.9% swing), Labour – who gained a substantial increase in their vote as support for Lib Dems in 1997 and 2001 moved back and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), whose candidate Graham Booth improved on his deposit-losing 2001 performance with a 4.7% increase in his vote.

In 2005, a referendum was held to appoint Torbay&#x27;s first elected mayor. In the ensuing election in October 2005, the winning candidate was a former Liberal parliamentary candidate, Nicholas Bye, who won the election as a Conservative.

In 2011, Gordon Oliver was elected as Torbay&#x27;s new mayor beating the existing mayor, Nicholas Bye. Oliver finished with 12,716 votes and Bye 9,631 after the two reached the second and final round of counting.

==Education==

Torquay has a number of primary schools, including St Margaret&#x27;s Primary School in St Marychurch which has around 329 pupils and is situated on a large site of over which was formerly a farm.

There are five main secondary schools in the town. Torquay Academy, previously known as Torquay Community School and Audley Park, has had its troubles in the past but since 2001 has come out of Ofsted special measures. The school has had a £26million pound rebuild and, in December 2010 when reassessed by Ofsted, it was told that it had become &quot;a good and improving school&quot;. It changed to academy status in September 2001, sponsored by Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School.

The Spires College (formerly Westlands School) is a combined secondary college and sixth form that takes students of all variations and in 2002 moved to a new building. St Cuthbert Mayne School is a joint Roman Catholic and Church of England secondary school and sixth form.

Torquay&#x27;s other two state secondary schools are selective. They are Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School and Torquay Grammar School for Girls which are available only to those that pass the Eleven plus exam and the schools&#x27; own standardised test. There are also a number of private schools in the area including the Abbey School.

For further education, students can either go to one of the sixth forms at the previously mentioned The Spires, St Cuthbert&#x27;s Mayne or Grammar schools, or they can go to South Devon College which is based in Long Road in Paignton on a new campus that fully opened in January 2006.

==Crime==

==Healthcare==
Torquay has two hospitals, the NHS-run Torbay Hospital which is situated on Newton Road, Shiphay and the private, non-emergency Mount Stuart Hospital run by Ramsay Health Care UK on St Vincent&#x27;s Road, Torre.

==In English culture==
A number of sketches for the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; television show (1969–74) were filmed on location in and around both Torquay and neighbouring Paignton. It was while staying in Torquay at the Gleneagles Hotel with the Python team in 1971, that John Cleese found inspiration (and the setting, although not the actual film location) for the popular sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975, 1979). Incidents during the Pythons&#x27; stay are said to include the owner, Donald Sinclair, having thrown Eric Idle&#x27;s suitcase out of a window in case it contained a bomb. Cleese later described the eccentric owner as, &quot;the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met&quot;, although Sinclair&#x27;s widow has since said her husband was totally misrepresented in the comedy.

In the 1970s, several episodes of the comedy series &quot;The Goodies&quot; were filmed in and around Torquay. In 1979, the town was again the site of filming, when the Ray Winstone, BAFTA nominated drama &quot;That Summer!&quot; was both set in and filmed around the town. In 2003, the movie &quot;Blackball&quot; starring Paul Kaye was set and partly shot there.

In October 2010, it was reported that Bristol-based artist Banksy had painted a mural on the wall of the Grosvenor Hotel in Belgrave Road. The mural shows a child drawing a robot, and uses the vent of an extractor fan as the head of the robot. The painting was vandalised in May 2011. This mural has now been painted over due to the Grosvenor Hotel being refurbished by the new owners (Richardsons) in 2014.

The Victorian mansion in Torquay where Agatha Christie was born and grew up, Ashfield in Barton Road, was demolished in 1961, to build an estate and extension for South Devon College. A blue plaque was unveiled in 2007, marking the spot.

<text>Wittmund is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated in East Frisia, on the North Sea coast. Neighboring districts are (from the east clockwise) Friesland, Leer and Aurich.

==Geography==
The district contains part of the Wadden Sea and of the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park. The coastal areas of the mainland are also known as &quot;Harlinger Land&quot;. The islands of Langeoog and Spiekeroog, both belonging to the East Frisian Islands, are part of this district.

==History==
The district was created by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1885 from the Amt Wittmund, the Amt Esens and the City of Esens. All were previously part of the District of Aurich. In 1977 the district was merged with the District of Friesland; however, the merger was not popular. The merger was declared unconstitutional in 1979 because it violated the rights of the former State of Oldenburg to which Friesland had belonged, and the two districts were re-established in their old boundaries.

==Partnerships==
The district has a partnership with the district of Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt. It was started with German reunification in 1990 to help to establish district administration in former East Germany.

==Coat of arms==

The ship in the coat of arms symbolizes the coastal location of the district. The three sails show heraldic symbols for the district — the front one shows a bear as the symbol of the Attena family from Esens, who ruled in the 14th and 15th century. The legend of the bear saving the City of Esens from its besiegers is associated with Balthasar Oomkens von Esens. The main sail shows two tournament lances as the symbol of the Hero Omken or Hero Oomkens von Esens, taken from the coat of arms of the City of Wittmund. The eagle in the rear sail stands for the castle and Amt Friedeburg.

<text>The Ems ( ; ) is a river in northwestern Germany. It runs through the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, and discharges into the Dollart Bay which is part of the Wadden Sea. Its total length is . The state border between the Lower Saxon area of East Friesland (Germany) and the province of Groningen (Netherlands), whose exact course was the subject of a border dispute between Germany and the Netherlands (settled in 2014), runs through the Ems estuary.

==Course==
The source of the river is in the southern Teutoburg Forest in North Rhine-Westphalia. In Lower Saxony, the brook becomes a comparatively large river. Here the swampy region of Emsland is named after the river. In Meppen the Ems is joined by its largest tributary, the Hase River. It then flows northwards, close to the Dutch border, into East Frisia. Near Emden, it flows into the Dollard bay (a national park) and then continues as a tidal river towards the Dutch city of Delfzijl.

Between Emden and Delfzijl, the Ems forms the border between the Netherlands and Germany and was subject to a mild dispute: the Dutch believed that the border runs through the geographical centre of the estuary, whereas the Germans claimed it runs through the deepest channel (which is close to the Dutch coast). As the parties are now friendly states with an open border, the argument went no further than an agreement to disagree. The issue was settled amicably in October 2014.

It became an active issue in late July 1914, when the Imperial German government began plans to mine the whole of the estuary that they claimed, in preparation for the launching of the Great War. The Dutch envoy in Berlin, Wilem Alexander Frederik Baron Gevers, tactfully announced the boundary was uncertain, and that the dispute was &quot;opgeschort&quot;, which could mean either &quot;suspended&quot; or &quot;resolved&quot;, depending on the context. The Dutch government endorsed the ambiguous declaration, thus relieving itself of an obligation to declare war on Germany for violating its neutrality. After the war, the dispute was resumed.

Past Delfzijl, the Ems discharges into the Wadden Sea, part of the North Sea. The two straits that separate the German island of Borkum from its neighbours Rottumeroog (Netherlands) and Memmert (Germany) continue the name &quot;Ems&quot;, as they are called &quot;Westere(e)ms&quot; and &quot;Osterems&quot; (West and East Ems).

==History==
The Ems was known to several ancient authors: Pliny the Elder in &quot;Natural History&quot; (4.14), Tacitus in the &quot;Annals&quot; (Book 1), Pomponius Mela (3.3), Strabo and Ptolemy, &quot;Geography&quot; (2.10). Ptolemy&#x27;s name for it was the Amisios potamos, and in Latin Amisius fluvius. The others used the same, or Amisia, or Amasia or Amasios. The identification is certain, as it always is listed between the Rhine and the Weser, and was the only river leading to the Teutoburg Forest.

The Amisius flowed from the Teutoburg Forest, home of the Cherusci, with the Bructeri and others bordering the river. These tribes were among the initial Franks. The Romans were quite interested in adding them to the empire, and to that end built a fort, Amisia, at the mouth of the Ems. As the river was navigable to their ships, they hoped to use it to access the tribes at its upper end.

Surrounding the river for most of its length, however, were swamps, bogs and marshes. The Romans found they had no place to stand, could not pick the most favourable ground, because there was none, and could not in general follow the strategies and tactics developed by the Roman army. They were stopped at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, 9 AD, and were checked again 6 years later. The Ems became a road leading nowhere for them, nor were they ever able to bridge the swamps satisfactorily with causeways.

The Dollart Bay near Emden did not exist until 1277, when a catastrophic storm surge flooded 43 parishes and killed an estimated 80,000 people. Most of the land lost in that flood has been reclaimed in a series of initiatives from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. The river in 1277 curved north by Emden, covering the area of the current Emden harbor complex.

Construction of canals in more modern times connected the Ems to other waterways, opening it as a highway of industrial transportation.

<text>Ebroin (died 680 or 681) was the Frankish mayor of the palace of Neustria on two occasions; firstly from 658 to his deposition in 673 and secondly from 675 to his death in 680 or 681. In a violent and despotic career, he strove to impose the authority of Neustria, which was under his control, over Burgundy and Austrasia.

==Life and career==
Following the failed coup of the Pippinid mayor Grimoald the Elder in Austrasia, the Merovingian court resided in Neustria. According to the &quot;Liber historiae Francorum&quot;, during the reign of Chlothar III the mayor Erchinoald of Neustria died. In 659, a council of Franks elected Ebroin as his replacement.

The Life of Saint Eligius records that as of the middle 670s Ebroin had only one child, a son named Bobo; Bobo was then convalescing from an illness contracted during his adolescence. Based on that, Bobo was likely born around 660.

Queen Balthild of Chelles served as regent for her son Chlothar III. After a power struggle with Ebroin, she withdrew to the Abbey of Chelles near Paris in 664.

The English scholar Bede (IV.1) took notice of an anecdote concerning Ebroin in 668. Bede tells that Ebroin waylaid an Englishman returning from Rome, for fear that the Byzantine Emperor (Constans II, residing in Syracuse) was plotting an alliance against his rule. It follows that Ebroin by 668 had arrogated to himself the &quot;de facto&quot; rule of Neustria and so (in theory) &quot;of the Franks&quot;.

It remains unclear how direct was Ebroin&#x27;s influence over the next four years (the &quot;Liber historiae&quot; may imply that Chlothar had roused himself by then), but when Chlothar died in 673 Ebroin was back in charge. Ebroin then raised another brother, Theuderic III, as king of Neustria, without consulting the other nobles. 

Ebroin endeavoured to maintain the union of Neustria and Burgundy, but the great Burgundian nobles wished to remain independent. They rose under bishop Leodegar (or &quot;Léger&quot;) of Autun and Adalrich, Duke of Alsace and offered the crown to Theuderic&#x27;s elder brother Childeric II, then ruling in Austrasia. Childeric replaced Ebroin with his Austrasian Mayor of the Palace, Wulfoald. Eboin&#x27;s life was spared at the intervention of a number of bishops; he was tonsured and confined to Luxeuil. A proclamation was then issued to the effect that each kingdom should keep its own laws and customs, that there should be no further interchange of functionaries between the kingdoms, and that no one should again set up a tyranny like that of Ebroin. Soon, however, Leodegar too was defeated by Wulfoald and the Austrasians, and was himself confined at Luxeuil in 673.

==Return to power==
When Childeric II was murdered at Bondi that year, by a disaffected Frank, Theoderic III was reinstalled as king in Neustria with Leudesius as his mayor. Ebroin and Leodegar took advantage of the confusion to leave the cloister, and soon found themselves once more face to face. Each looked for support to a different Merovingian king, Ebroin even proclaiming a false Merovingian imposter as sovereign. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once again, now with a score to settle with Leodegar.

About 675 Ebroin reimposed his authority over Neustria and most of Burgundy, and induced the Duke of Champagne and the Bishops of Châlons and Valence to attack Autun. They invaded the city and forced it to surrender. Ebroin had Leodegar&#x27;s eyes put out. Ebroin persuaded the king that Childeric&#x27;s murder had occurred under Leodegar&#x27;s instigation; and so the king had Leodegar additionally arrested, tried, and exiled. On 12 October 678 Ebroin had his enemy led away and murdered.

Ebroin meanwhile had defeated the Austrasians at the Battle of Bois-du-Fays, near Laon, uniting France under Neustrian rule. After the battle, Duke Martin of Laon, who had made it back to his city, was lured to Ecry with false assurances on the pretext of negotiations with Theuderic. Martin and his supporters were then killed. 

His triumph, however, was short-lived; he was assassinated in 681, the victim of a combined attack of his numerous enemies.

In 684, Ansoald, bishop of Poitiers in Neustria, the homeland of Leudesius, commissioned a Life of Leodegar the Burgundian. It cast Ebroin as an enemy of God motivated by nothing but ambition and a lust for power. This biography became canonised in the Church to such an extent that Leodegar, too, was canonised as Saint Leger. Tales of Ebroin&#x27;s infamy were also found useful by the Austrasians, whose own ambitious mayoral family commissioned the continuations to the chronicle of Fredegar.

<text>Mount Royal (, ) is a mountain in the city of Montreal, immediately west of Downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the mountain&#x27;s name.

The mountain is part of the Monteregian Hills situated between the Laurentians and the Appalachian Mountains. It gave its Latin name, &quot;Mons Regius&quot;, to the Monteregian chain. The mountain consists of three peaks: Colline de la Croix (or Mont Royal proper) at , Colline d&#x27;Outremont (or Mount Murray, in the borough of Outremont) at , and [[Westmount Summit]] at elevation above mean sea level.

==Geology==
Mount Royal is the deep extension of a vastly eroded ancient volcanic complex, which was probably active about 125 million years ago.

The mountain, along with the other mountains of the Monteregian Hills, was formed when the North American Plate moved westward over the New England hotspot. By a process known as intrusion, magma intruded into the sedimentary rocks underneath the area, producing at least eight igneous stocks. The main rock type is a gabbro composed of pyroxene, olivine and variable amounts of plagioclase. During and after the main stage of intrusion, the gabbros and surrounding rocks were intruded by a series of volcanic dikes and sills. Subsequently, the surrounding softer sedimentary rock was eroded, leaving behind the resistant igneous rock that forms the mountain.

The mineral montroyalite, discovered in Montreal, is named after the mountain that provided the definition sample.

== History ==

The first European to scale the mountain was Jacques Cartier, guided there in 1535 by the people of the village of Hochelaga. He named it in honour of his patron, Francis I of France. He wrote in his journal: &quot;And among these fields is situated and seated the said town of Hochelaga, near to and adjoining a mountain... We named this mountain Mount Royal.&quot;

One theory is that the name of the Island of Montréal derives from &quot;Mont Réal&quot;, as the mountain&#x27;s name was spelled in Middle French (&quot;Mont Royal&quot; in Modern French). However, Cartier&#x27;s 1535 diary entry refers to &quot;le mont Royal.&quot; Another argument, mentioned by the Government of Canada on its website concerning Canadian place names, is that the name Montréal was adopted because a Venetian map from 1556 used the Italian name of the mountain, &quot;Monte Real.&quot; The name was first applied to the island and was unofficially applied to the city, formerly named &quot;Ville-Marie&quot;, by the 18th century.

In 1643, Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve made a pilgrimage to the top of the mountain to fulfill a vow made in the winter season on occasion of a great flood that swept up to the town palisades.

In 1876, land owner and farmer James Swail began planning residential subdivisions on the western slope of Mount Murray, in what is now the Cote-des-Neiges district. In 1906, a large housing development was started in the area, called Northmount Heights, with homes built along what is now Decelles Street by developer Northmount Land Company. Much of this area has since been expropriated by the Université de Montréal.

In 1914–1918, the Mount Royal Tunnel was dug under the mountain by the Canadian Northern Railway, a predecessor of the Canadian National Railway. It is currently used by the Réseau express métropolitain.

The area was briefly considered as a candidate for the site of Expo 67 before the exposition grounds were ultimately built on adjoining islands in the Saint Lawrence River.

The hilly roads of the park have been used for cycle racing since the 1970s, hosting the 1974 UCI Road Cycling World Championships, the individual road race cycling event at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and the subsequent annual races of Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal (1998–2009) and Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal (2010–present).

== Geography ==
=== Topography ===
Mount Royal is about 4 kilometers ( miles) east to west and 2.5 kilometers ( miles) north to south. The mountain emerges from the plains occupied by Montreal and neighboring regions.

=== Road networks ===
Two roads cross the territory:

*The Camillien Houde Way (named Remembrance Road on part of its route)
*Côte-des-Neiges Road

==Natural heritage==
=== Fauna ===
Mount Royal is home to many animal species including gray squirrel, raccoon, fox, marmot, striped skunk, bee and various species of birds.

=== Flora ===
From the point of view of the flora, the mountain shelters a set of natural spaces and semi-natural rich in trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants

==Mount Royal Cross==
The first Mount Royal Cross was placed there in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, the founder of the city, in fulfillment of a vow he made to the Virgin Mary when praying to her to stop a disastrous flood. Today, the mountain is crowned by a illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste and now owned by the city. It was converted to fibre-optic light in 1992, and then to LEDs in 2009. The cross is usually lit in white, but can now be changed to any colour, including the purple traditionally used upon the death of a pope.

Beside the cross, a plaque marks the placement of a time capsule in 1992, during Montréal&#x27;s 350th birthday celebration. It contains messages and drawings from 12,000 children, depicting their visions for the city in the year 2142, when the capsule is scheduled to be opened.

== Mount Royal Park ==
The mountain is the site of Mount Royal Park (), one of Montreal&#x27;s largest greenspaces. The park was originally designed by Frederick Law Olmsted (who also co-designed New York City&#x27;s Central Park) and was inaugurated in 1876, although not completed to his design.

Olmsted had planned to emphasize the mountainous topography through the use of vegetation. Shade trees at the bottom of the carriage path would resemble a valley. As the visitor went higher, the vegetation would get more sparse to give the illusion of exaggerated height. However, Montreal suffered a depression in the mid-1870s and many of Olmsted&#x27;s plans were abandoned. The carriage way was built, but it was done hastily and without regards to the original plan. None of the vegetation choices were followed.

The park contains two belvederes, the more prominent of which is the Kondiaronk Belvedere, a semicircular plaza with a Mount Royal Chalet overlooking Downtown Montreal. Built in 1906, it is named for the Petun chief Kondiaronk, whose influence led to the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701.

Other features of the park are Beaver Lake (a small artificial lake), a snow tube and toboggan run, cross-country skiing trails, a sculpture garden and Smith House, an interpretive centre. At the foot of the hill, overlooking Park Avenue, the park features the George-Étienne Cartier Monument (home to the Tam-Tams) and a gazebo (more properly, a bandstand) which has been named in honour of Mordecai Richler.

The lush forest has been badly damaged, both by Mayor Drapeau&#x27;s so-called morality cuts of the 1950s and by the Ice Storm of 1998, but has since largely recovered. The forest is a green jewel rising above downtown Montreal and is known for its beautiful autumn foliage as well as its extensive hiking and cross-country ski trails. Biking is restricted to the main gravel roads.
From 1885 to 1920, the Mount Royal Funicular Railway brought sightseers to its peak. After it ceased service, Montreal&#x27;s No. 11 streetcar brought visitors to the peak until 1959. A roadway named for longtime but controversial former mayor Camillien Houde now bisects the mountain, although Houde had been opposed to the idea of putting a road through the park.

The park, cemeteries, and several adjacent parks and institutions have been combined into the Mount Royal Natural and Historical District (&quot;Arrondissement historique et naturel du Mont-Royal&quot;) by the provincial government in order to legally protect the rich cultural and natural heritage of the region.

===Parc Tiohtià:ke Otsira&#x27;kéhne===

In June 2017, during the 375th anniversary of Montreal, the city formally named the greenspace surrounding the Outremont peak Parc Tiohtià:ke Otsira&#x27;kéhne, Mohawk for &quot;the place of the big fire,&quot; reflecting how the hill had been used for a fire beacon by First Nations people. It has an area of .

===Wintertime===


Mount Royal Park currently hosts a snow tube and toboggan run on one of the former alpine ski slopes, as well as 7 groomed cross-country ski and snowshoe trails which total , with equipment rental available onsite.

One of the most popular activities to do on Beaver Lake is to skate; this activity is free if you have your own equipment.

The former alpine ski slope featured a T-bar and a drop. Mechanical lift devices were first installed in Mount Royal Park in 1945. In the 1940s, there were two and a half miles of ski slopes available. A ski shop was first installed in the park in 1938. Prior to that, in the 1920s, one of the best ski jumps in Canada was the one on Mount Royal, near Côte-des-Neiges.

Founded in 1840, the now-defunct Montreal Snow Shoe Club, with members drawn from some of Montreal&#x27;s prominent businessmen, would meet each week during the winter at nightfall on Sherbrooke Street near McGill College Avenue to snowshoe through Mount Royal Park, lit by torchlight. Club members began wearing blue tuques on their outings around 1870. Recently, the tradition has been revived as the &quot;Tuques Bleues&quot; celebration by the &quot;Les amis de la montagne&quot;, a charitable organization that works to protect and preserve the park.

=== Tam-Tams ===
In the summer, Mount Royal hosts a popular activity known as Tam-Tams, or the &quot;Tam-Tam Jam&quot;, whereby a number of Montrealers and visitors play hand drums (such as djembes) on the east slope of the mountain, near the George-Étienne Cartier Monument. The Sunday afternoon gatherings attract people of various backgrounds. Often, dozens of tam-tam players perform their art at the same time, encouraging others to dance. In addition, many children and adults participate nearby in a battle with foam-padded weapons.

The Tam-tams began in the late 1970s with a workshop on African drumming at a jazz bar on Ontario Street. It is not organized by the municipal authorities. Despite initial resistance by participants, the city now intervenes in the event, restricting commercial activity to registered members in designated areas and assigning police and first aid technicians to ensure the safety of those present. Although initially controversial in light of the event&#x27;s communal and countercultural vibe (as well as a permissive attitude towards then-illegal cannabis use), the police presence has not led to conflict.

===Jeanne-Mance Park===

Facing the mountain across Park Avenue is Jeanne-Mance Park. A popular recreational area, Jeanne-Mance Park features a playground, a wading pool, tennis courts, various sports fields, and in winter, a skating rink.

==Transmission tower==

The park is also home to the CBC&#x27;s Mount Royal transmitter facility, which comprises two large buildings: one used primarily by the CBC for its 2 Montreal stations, CBMT-DT and CBFT-DT, and one used by the private television stations. There is also a short (about ) candelabra tower, from which nearly all of Montreal&#x27;s television and FM radio stations broadcast. Because of the proximity of this tower to public areas of the park, in recent years significant concerns have been raised about radio-frequency radiation exposure; at several points formerly accessible to park users near the tower, radiation was found to be significantly higher than that permitted for the general public.

The &quot;shortness&quot; indicated above was dictated by the maximum allowable height (1100 feet above sea level) dictated by the federal Department of Transport because of the proximity to the flight path to Trudeau Airport nearby. The engineering challenge was to combine all the desired antennas in the limited space between the mountain top and 1100 feet above sea level, which led to the &quot;candelabra&quot; design.

==Adjacent landmarks==
Outside the park, Mount Royal&#x27;s slopes are also home to such Montreal landmarks as Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory, Canada&#x27;s largest church; McGill University; the Montreal General Hospital; McGill&#x27;s Molson Stadium, home to the CFL&#x27;s Montreal Alouettes; the McTavish reservoir; Université de Montréal; the École Polytechnique de Montréal; the Îlot-Trafalgar-Gleneagles historic block; and some well-off residential neighbourhoods such as Upper Westmount and Upper Outremont.

<text>Luxeuil-les-Bains () is a commune in the Haute-Saône department in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté west of Mulhouse in eastern France.

==History==

Luxeuil (sometimes rendered Luxeu in older texts) was the Roman Luxovium and contained many fine buildings at the time of its destruction by the Huns under Attila in 451. In 590, St Columban here founded the Abbey of Luxeuil, afterwards one of the most famous in Franche-Comté.

In the 8th century, it was destroyed by the Saracens; afterwards rebuilt, monastery and town were devastated by the Normans, Magyars, and Muslims in the 9th century and pillaged on several occasions afterwards. The burning of the monastery and ravaging of the town are commonly used to illustrate the point that no place in Europe was safe during the invasions.

The abbey schools were celebrated in the Middle Ages and the abbots had great influence; but their power was curtailed by the emperor Charles V and the abbey was suppressed at the time of the French Revolution.

<doc id="145295" wikidata="Q719721" url="?curid=145295" title="Wilfrid">
<text>Wilfrid ( – 709 or 710) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Francia, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king&#x27;s son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid&#x27;s absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid&#x27;s appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid&#x27;s return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid&#x27;s retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.

After becoming Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, Theodore of Tarsus resolved the situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the liturgy. However his diocese was very large, and Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking up some of the larger dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore took the opportunity to implement his reforms despite Wilfrid&#x27;s objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope Agatho ruled in Wilfrid&#x27;s favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him.

Wilfrid spent the next few years in Selsey, now in West Sussex, where he founded an episcopal see and converted the pagan inhabitants of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity. Theodore and Wilfrid settled their differences, and Theodore urged the new Northumbrian king, Aldfrith, to allow Wilfrid&#x27;s return. Aldfrith agreed to do so, but in 691 he expelled Wilfrid again. Wilfrid went to Mercia, where he helped missionaries and acted as bishop for the Mercian king. Wilfrid appealed to the papacy about his expulsion in 700, and the pope ordered that an English council should be held to decide the issue. This council, held at Austerfield in South Yorkshire in 702, attempted to confiscate all of Wilfrid&#x27;s possessions, and so Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal against the decision. His opponents in Northumbria excommunicated him, but the papacy upheld Wilfrid&#x27;s side, and he regained possession of Ripon and Hexham, his Northumbrian monasteries. Wilfrid died in 709 or 710. After his death, he was venerated as a saint.

Historians then and now have been divided over Wilfrid. His followers commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; (or &quot;Life of Saint Wilfrid&quot;) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled a large number of monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.

== Background ==

During Wilfrid&#x27;s lifetime Britain and Ireland consisted of a number of small kingdoms. Traditionally the English people were thought to have been divided into seven kingdoms, but modern historiography has shown that this is a simplification of a much more confused situation. A late 7th-century source, the Tribal Hidage, lists the peoples south of the Humber river; among the largest groups of peoples are the West Saxons (later Wessex), the East Angles and Mercians (later the Kingdom of Mercia), and the Kingdom of Kent. Smaller groups who at that time had their own royalty but were later absorbed into larger kingdoms include the peoples of Magonsæte, Lindsey, Hwicce, the East Saxons, the South Saxons, the Isle of Wight, and the Middle Angles. Other even smaller groups had their own rulers, but their size means that they do not often appear in the histories. There were also native Britons in the west, in modern-day Wales and Cornwall, who formed kingdoms including those of Dumnonia, Dyfed, and Gwynedd.

Between the Humber and Forth the English had formed into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, including Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived as an independent power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east a small number of Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts with the rest of the British Isles, and during the early 6th century they emigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain.

Christianity had only recently arrived in some of these kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.

=== Sources ===
The main sources for knowledge of Wilfrid are the medieval &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid&#x27;s death, and the works of the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop&#x27;s lifetime. Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The &quot;Vita&quot; is selective in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid&#x27;s activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid&#x27;s attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen&#x27;s work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the &quot;Vita&quot; is the main source of information on Wilfrid&#x27;s life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid&#x27;s reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints&#x27; lives, as was the case with Stephen&#x27;s work. It appears that the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.

Bede also covers Wilfrid&#x27;s life in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;, but this account is more measured and restrained than the &quot;Vita&quot;. In the &quot;Historia&quot;, Bede used Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; as a source, reworking the information and adding new material when possible. Other, more minor, sources for Wilfrid&#x27;s life include a mention of Wilfrid in one of Bede&#x27;s letters. A poetical &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; by Frithegod written in the 10th century is essentially a rewrite of Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot;, produced in celebration of the movement of Wilfrid&#x27;s relics to Canterbury. Wilfrid is also mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, but as the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was probably a 9th-century compilation, the material on Wilfrid may ultimately have derived either from Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; or from Bede. Another, later, source is the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; written by Eadmer, a 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer and monk from Canterbury. This source is highly influenced by the contemporary concerns of its writer, but does attempt to provide some new material besides reworking Bede.

Many historians, including the editor of Bede&#x27;s works, Charles Plummer, have seen in Bede&#x27;s writings a dislike of Wilfrid. The historian Walter Goffart goes further, suggesting that Bede wrote his &quot;Historia&quot; as a reaction to Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;, and that Stephen&#x27;s work was written as part of a propaganda campaign to defend a &quot;Wilfridian&quot; party in Northumbrian politics. Some historians, including James Fraser, find that a credible view, but others such as Nick Higham are less convinced of Bede&#x27;s hostility to Wilfrid.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood and early education ===
Wilfrid was born in Northumbria around 633. James Fraser argues that Wilfrid&#x27;s family were aristocrats from Deira, pointing out that most of Wilfrid&#x27;s early contacts were from that area. A conflict with his stepmother when he was about 14 years old drove Wilfrid to leave home, probably without his father&#x27;s consent. Wilfrid&#x27;s background is never explicitly described as noble, but the king&#x27;s retainers were frequent guests at his father&#x27;s house, and on leaving home Wilfrid equipped his party with horses and clothes fit for a royal court.

Queen Eanflæd became Wilfrid&#x27;s patroness following his arrival at the court of her husband, King Oswiu. She sent him to study under Cudda, formerly one of her husband&#x27;s retainers, but by that time in about 648 a monk on the island of Lindisfarne. The monastery on the island had recently been founded by Aidan, who had been instrumental in converting Northumbria to Christianity. At Lindisfarne Wilfrid is said to have &quot;learned the whole Psalter by heart and several books&quot;. Wilfrid studied at Lindisfarne for a few years before going to the Kentish king&#x27;s court at Canterbury in 652, where he stayed with relatives of Queen Eanflæd. The queen had given Wilfrid a letter of introduction to pass to her cousin, King Eorcenberht, to ensure that Wilfrid was received by the king. While in Kent, Wilfrid&#x27;s career was advanced by Eanflæd&#x27;s cousin Hlothere, who was later the King of Kent from 673 to 685. The Kentish court included a number of visiting clergymen at that time, including Benedict Biscop, a noted missionary. Wilfrid appears to have spent about a year in Kent, but the exact chronology is uncertain.

=== Time at Rome and Lyon ===

Wilfrid left Kent for Rome in the company of Benedict Biscop, another of Eanflæd&#x27;s contacts. This is the first pilgrimage to Rome known to have been undertaken by English natives, and took place some time between 653 and 658. According to Wilfrid&#x27;s later biographer, Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid left Biscop&#x27;s company at Lyon, where Wilfrid stayed under the patronage of Annemund, the archbishop. Stephen says that Annemund wanted to marry Wilfrid to the archbishop&#x27;s niece, and to make Wilfrid the governor of a Frankish province, but that Wilfrid refused and continued on his journey to Rome. There he learned the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter, and studied the Roman practice of relic collecting. He developed a close friendship with Boniface Consiliarius during his time in Rome. After an audience with the pope, Wilfrid returned to Lyon.

Stephen of Ripon says that Wilfrid stayed in Lyon for three years, leaving only after the archbishop&#x27;s murder. However, Annemund&#x27;s murder took place in 660 and Wilfrid returned to England in 658, suggesting that Stephen&#x27;s chronology is awry. Stephen says that Annemund gave Wilfrid a clerical tonsure, although this does not appear to mean that he became a monk, merely that he entered the clergy. Bede is silent on the subject of Wilfrid&#x27;s monastic status, although Wilfrid probably became a monk during his time in Rome, or afterwards while he was in Gaul. Some historians, however, believe that Wilfrid was never a monk. While in Gaul, Wilfrid absorbed Frankish ecclesiastical practices, including some aspects from the monasteries founded by Columbanus. This influence may be seen in Wilfrid&#x27;s probable adoption of a Frankish ceremony in his consecration of churches later in his life, as well as in his employment of Frankish masons to build his churches. Wilfrid would also have learned of the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; in Gaul, as Columbanus&#x27; monasteries followed that monastic rule.

=== Abbot of Ripon ===
After Wilfrid&#x27;s return to Northumbria in about 658, Cenwalh, King of Wessex, recommended Wilfrid to Alhfrith, Oswiu&#x27;s son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy. Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father&#x27;s rule, and the most likely heir to his father&#x27;s throne as his half-brothers were still young. Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, formed around a group of monks from Melrose Abbey, followers of the Irish monastic customs. Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs; Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled. Wilfrid introduced the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; into Ripon, claiming that he was the first person in England to make a monastery follow it, but this claim rests on the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; and does not say where Wilfrid became knowledgeable about the &quot;Rule&quot;, nor exactly what form of the &quot;Rule&quot; was being referred to. Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by Agilbert, Bishop of Dorchester in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex. Wilfrid was a protégé of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid&#x27;s consecration as a bishop. The monk Ceolfrith was attracted to Ripon from Gilling Abbey, which had recently been depopulated as a result of the plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there. Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow.

== Whitby ==
=== Background to Whitby ===
The Roman churches and those in Britain and Ireland (often called &quot;Celtic&quot; churches) used different methods to calculate the date of Easter. The church in Northumbria had traditionally used the Celtic method, and that was the date observed by King Oswiu. His wife Eanflæd and a son, Alhfrith, celebrated Easter on the Roman date, which meant that while one part of the royal court was still observing the Lenten fast, another would be celebrating with feasting.

Oswiu called a church council held at Whitby Abbey in 664 in an attempt to resolve this controversy. Although Oswiu himself had been brought up in the &quot;Celtic&quot; tradition, political pressures may have influenced his decision to call a council, as well as fears that if dissent over the date of Easter continued in the Northumbrian church it could lead to internal strife. The historian Richard Abels speculates that the expulsion of Eata from Ripon may have been the spark that led to the king&#x27;s decision to call the council. Regional tensions within Northumbria between the two traditional divisions, Bernicia and Deira, appear to have played a part, as churchmen in Bernicia favoured the Celtic method of dating and those in Deira may have leaned towards the Roman method. Abels identifies several conflicts contributing to both the calling of the council and its outcome, including a generational conflict between Oswiu and Alhfrith and the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Deusdedit. Political concerns unrelated to the dating problem, such as the decline of Oswiu&#x27;s preeminence among the other English kingdoms and the challenge to that position by Mercia, were also factors.

=== Synod ===
Wilfrid attended the synod, or council, of Whitby, as a member of the party favouring the continental practice of dating Easter, along with James the Deacon, Agilbert, and Alhfrith. Those supporting the &quot;Celtic&quot; viewpoint were King Oswiu, Hilda, the Abbess of Whitby, Cedd, a bishop, and Colmán of Lindisfarne, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.

Wilfrid was chosen to present the Roman position to the council; he also acted as Agilbert&#x27;s interpreter, as the latter did not speak the local language. Bede describes Wilfrid as saying that those who did not calculate the date of Easter according to the Roman system were committing a sin. Wilfrid&#x27;s speech in favour of adopting Roman church practices helped secure the eclipse of the &quot;Celtic&quot; party in 664, although most Irish churches did not adopt the Roman date of Easter until 704, and Iona held out until 716. Many of the Irish monasteries did not observe the Roman Easter, but they were not isolated from the continent; by the time of Whitby the southern Irish were already observing the Roman Easter date, and Irish clergy were in contact with their continental counterparts. Those monks and clergy unable to accept the Whitby decision left Northumbria, some going to Ireland and others to Iona.

== York ==
=== Elevation to the episcopate ===
After the supporters of the Celtic dating had withdrawn following the Council of Whitby, Wilfrid became the most prominent Northumbrian cleric. As a result, and because of his performance at Whitby, Wilfrid was elected to a bishopric in Northumbria about a year after the council. It is unclear where his diocese was located, although he was considered to be Alhfrith&#x27;s bishop. The &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; states that, nominated by both Oswiu and Alhfrith, he was made bishop at York, and that he was a metropolitan bishop, but York at that time was not a Metropolitan Diocese. Bede says that Alhfrith alone nominated Wilfrid, and that Oswiu subsequently proposed an alternative candidate, &quot;imitating the actions of his son&quot;. Several theories have been suggested to explain the discrepancies between the two sources. One is that Alhfrith wished the seat to be at York, another is that Wilfrid was bishop only in Deira, a third supposes that Wilfrid was never bishop at York and that his diocese was only part of Deira. At that time the Anglo-Saxon dioceses were not strictly speaking geographical designations, rather they were bishoprics for the tribes or peoples.

Wilfrid refused to be consecrated in Northumbria at the hands of Anglo-Saxon bishops. Deusdedit had died shortly after Whitby, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid considered to have been validly consecrated he travelled to Compiègne, to be consecrated by Agilbert, the Bishop of Paris. During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was exposed to a higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example of which is that he was carried to his consecration ceremony on a throne supported by nine bishops.

=== Delays and difficulties ===
Wilfrid delayed his return from Gaul, only to find on his arrival back in Northumbria that Ceadda had been installed as bishop in his place. The reason for Wilfrid&#x27;s delay has never been clear, although the historians Eric John and Richard Abels theorise that it was caused by Alhfrith&#x27;s unsuccessful revolt against Oswiu. They suggest that the rebellion happened shortly after Whitby, perhaps while Wilfrid was in Gaul for his consecration. Because Oswiu knew that Alhfrith had been a supporter of Wilfrid&#x27;s, Oswiu prevented Wilfrid&#x27;s return, suspecting Wilfrid of supporting his rivals. That Ceadda was supported by Oswiu, and Wilfrid had been a supporter of Oswiu&#x27;s son, lends further credence to the theory that Alhfrith&#x27;s rebellion took place while Wilfrid was in Gaul. Stephen of Ripon reported that Wilfrid was expelled by &quot;Quartodecimans&quot;, or those who supported the celebration of Easter on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan, whether or not this was a Sunday. However, as the Irish church had never been Quartodecimans, Stephen in this instance was constructing a narrative to put Wilfrid in the best light.

During his return to Northumbria Wilfrid&#x27;s ship was blown ashore on the Sussex coast, the inhabitants of which were at that time pagan. On being attacked by the locals, Wilfrid&#x27;s party killed the head priest before refloating their ship and making their escape. The historian Marion Gibbs suggests that after this episode Wilfrid visited Kent again, and took part in the diplomacy related to Wigheard&#x27;s appointment to the see of Canterbury. Wilfrid may also have taken part in negotiations to persuade King Cenwalh of Wessex to allow Agilbert to return to his see.

=== Favourable outcome ===
Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid spent the three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon. He occasionally performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river Humber. The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid may not have been allowed to return to Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court, but most historians have argued that Wilfrid was at Ripon.

Wilfrid&#x27;s monasteries in Mercia may date from this time, as King Wulfhere of Mercia gave him large grants of land in Mercia. Wilfrid may have persuaded King Ecgberht of Kent in 669 to build a church in an abandoned Roman fort at Reculver. When Theodore, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, arrived in England in 669 it was clear that something had to be done about the situation in Northumbria. Ceadda&#x27;s election to York was improper, and Theodore did not consider Ceadda&#x27;s consecration to have been valid. Consequently, Theodore deposed Ceadda, leaving the way open for Wilfrid, who was finally installed in his see in 669, the first Saxon to occupy the see of York. Wilfrid spent the next nine years building churches, including at the monastery at Hexham, and attending to diocesan business. He continued to exercise control over his monastic houses of Ripon and Hexham while he was bishop. Oswiu&#x27;s death on 15 February 670 eliminated a source of friction and helped to assure Wilfrid&#x27;s return.

While at York, Wilfrid was considered the &quot;bishop of the Northumbrian peoples&quot;; Bede records that Wilfrid&#x27;s diocese was contiguous with the area ruled by Oswiu. The diocese was restricted to north of the Humber, however. Wilfrid may also have sought to exercise some ecclesiastical functions in the Pictish kingdom, as he is accorded the title &quot;bishop of the Northumbrians and the Picts&quot; in 669. Further proof of attempted Northumbrian influence in the Pictish regions is provided by the establishment for the Picts in 681 of a diocese centred on Abercorn, in the old territory of the British kingdom of Gododdin. The grants of land to Wilfrid west of the Pennines testify to Northumbrian expansion in that area. The &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; claims that Wilfrid had ecclesiastical rule over Britons and Gaels. In 679, while Wilfrid was in Rome, he claimed authority over &quot;all the northern part of Britain, Ireland and the islands, which are inhabited by English and British peoples, as well as by Gaelic and Pictish peoples&quot;.

=== Diocesan affairs ===
Wilfrid did not attend the Council of Hertford held in September 672, but he did send representatives. Among the council&#x27;s resolutions was one postponing a decision on the creation of new dioceses, which affected Wilfrid later. Another ruling confirmed that the Roman calculation for the date of Easter should be adopted, and that bishops should act only in their own dioceses. During the middle 670s Wilfrid acted as middleman in the negotiations to return a Merovingian prince, Dagobert II, from his exile in Ireland to Gaul. Wilfrid was one of the first churchmen in Northumbria to use written charters as records of gifts to his churches. He ordered the creation of a listing of all benefactions received by Ripon, which was recited at the dedication ceremony.

Wilfrid was an advocate for the use of music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;, which has led to the assumption that the &quot;Vita&quot; was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid&#x27;s long-time companions. Recent scholarship has come to believe that the &quot;Vita&quot; was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid in the last years of Wilfrid&#x27;s life, not a close companion.

Wilfrid introduced the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; into the monasteries he founded. It appears likely that he was the first to introduce the Benedictine Rule into England, as evidence is lacking that Augustine&#x27;s monastery at Canterbury followed the &quot;Rule&quot;. He also was one of the first Anglo-Saxon bishops to record the gifts of land and property to his church, which he did at Ripon. Easter tables, used to calculate the correct date to celebrate Easter, were brought in from Rome where the Dionysiac Easter tables had been recently introduced. He set up schools and became a religious advisor to the Northumbrian queen Æthelthryth, first wife of Ecgfrith. Æthelthryth donated the land at Hexham where Wilfrid founded a monastery and built a church using some recycled stones from the Roman town of Corbridge. When Wilfrid arrived in York as bishop the cathedral&#x27;s roof was on the point of collapse; he had it repaired and covered in lead, and had glass set in the windows.

The historian Barbara Yorke says of Wilfrid at this time that he &quot;seems to have continued a campaign against any survival of &#x27;Irish errors&#x27; and distrusted any communities that remained in contact with Iona or other Irish religious houses which did not follow the Roman Easter&quot;. He also worked to combat pagan practices, building a church at Melrose on a pagan site. Contemporaries said of him that he was the first native bishop to &quot;introduce the Catholic way of life to the churches of the English&quot;. He did not neglect his pastoral duties in his diocese, making visits throughout the diocese to baptise and perform other episcopal functions, such as consecrating new churches. Some of the monasteries in his diocese were put under his protection by their abbots or abbesses, who were seeking someone to help protect their endowments. In ruling over such monasteries, Wilfrid may have been influenced by the Irish model of a group of monasteries all ruled by one person, sometimes while holding episcopal office.

Wilfrid was criticised for dressing his household and servants in clothing fit for royalty. He was accompanied on his travels by a retinue of warriors, one of whom, while at York, Wilfrid sent to abduct a young boy who had been promised to the church but whose family had changed their mind. Wilfrid also educated young men, both for clerical and secular careers.

== Expulsion ==

=== Dispute with the king ===

In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was expelled from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid&#x27;s position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid&#x27;s expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth&#x27;s entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues that they had been part of the queen&#x27;s dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid&#x27;s close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid&#x27;s monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.

Theodore took advantage of the situation to implement decrees of some councils on dividing up large dioceses. Theodore set up new bishoprics from Wilfrid&#x27;s diocese, with seats at York, Hexham, Lindisfarne, and one in the region of Lindsey. The Lindsey see was quickly absorbed by the Diocese of Lichfield, but the other three remained separate. The bishops chosen for these sees, Eata at Hexham, Eadhæd at Lindsey, and Bosa at York, had all either been supporters of the &quot;Celtic&quot; party at Whitby, or been trained by those who were. Eata had also been ejected from Ripon by Wilfrid. The new bishops were unacceptable to Wilfrid, who claimed they were not truly members of the Church because of their support for the &quot;Celtic&quot; method of dating Easter, and thus he could not serve alongside them. Another possible problem for Wilfrid was that the three new bishops did not come from Wilfrid&#x27;s monastic houses nor from the communities where the bishops&#x27; seats were based. This was contrary to the custom of the time, which was to promote bishoprics from within the locality. Wilfrid&#x27;s deposition became tangled up in a dispute over whether or not the Gregorian plan for Britain, with two metropolitan sees, the northern one set at York, would be followed through or abandoned. Wilfrid seems to have felt that he had metropolitan authority over the northern part of England, but Theodore never acknowledged that claim, instead claiming authority over the whole of the island of Britain.

=== Appeal to Rome ===
Wilfrid went to Rome after his expulsion to appeal against Theodore and Ecgfrith&#x27;s decisions, the first Englishman to challenge a royal or ecclesiastical decision by petitioning the papacy. On the way he stopped at the court of Aldgisl, the Frisian king in Utrecht for most of 678. Wilfrid had been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, and ended up in Frisia according to some historians. Others state that he intended to journey via Frisia to avoid Neustria, whose Mayor of the Palace, Ebroin, disliked Wilfrid. He wintered in Frisia, avoiding the diplomatic efforts of Ebroin, who according to Stephen attempted to have Wilfrid killed. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid&#x27;s biographer says that most of the nobles converted, but the success was short-lived. After Frisia, he stopped at the court of Dagobert II in Austrasia, where the king offered Wilfrid the Bishopric of Strasbourg, which Wilfrid refused. Once in Italy, Wilfrid was received by Perctarit, a Lombard king, who gave him a place at his court.

Pope Agatho held a synod in October 679, which although it ordered Wilfrid&#x27;s restoration and the return of the monasteries to his control, also directed that the new dioceses should be retained. Wilfrid was given the right to replace any bishop in the new dioceses to whom he objected. The council had been called to deal with the Monothelete controversy, and Wilfrid&#x27;s concerns were not the sole focus of the council. In fact, the historian Henry Chadwick thought that one reason Wilfrid secured the mostly favourable outcome was that Agatho wished for Wilfrid&#x27;s support and testimony that the English Church was free of the monothelete heresy. Although Wilfrid did not win a complete victory, he did secure a papal decree limiting the number of dioceses in England to 12. Wilfrid also secured the right for his monasteries of Ripon and Hexham to be directly supervised by the pope, preventing any further interference in their affairs by the diocesan bishops.

Wilfrid returned to England after the council via Gaul. According to Stephen of Ripon, after the death of Dagobert II, Ebroin wished to imprison Wilfrid, but Wilfrid miraculously escaped. In 680 Wilfrid returned to Northumbria and appeared before a royal council. He produced the papal decree ordering his restoration, but was instead briefly imprisoned and then exiled by the king. Wilfrid stayed for a short time in the kingdom of the Middle Angles and at Wessex, but soon took refuge in Sussex with King Æthelwealh of Sussex.

== Missions in Sussex ==

Wilfrid spent the next five years preaching to, and converting the pagan inhabitants of Sussex, the South Saxons. He also founded Selsey Abbey, on an estate near Selsey of 87 hides, given to Wilfrid by Æthelwealh, king of the South Saxons. Bede attributes Wilfrid&#x27;s ability to convert the South Saxons to his teaching them how to fish, and contrasts it with the lack of success of the Irish monk Dicuill. Bede also says that the Sussex area had been experiencing a drought for three years before Wilfrid&#x27;s arrival, but miraculously when Wilfrid arrived, and started baptising converts, rain began to fall. Wilfrid worked with Bishop Erkenwald of London, helping to set up the church in Sussex. Erkenwald also helped reconcile Wilfrid and Theodore before Theodore&#x27;s death in 690. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh died during an invasion of his kingdom by Cædwalla of Wessex. Wilfrid previously had contact with Cædwalla, and may have served as his spiritual advisor before Cædwalla&#x27;s invasion of Sussex. After Æthelwealh&#x27;s death and Cædwalla&#x27;s accession to the throne of Wessex, Wilfrid became one of the new king&#x27;s advisors, and the king was converted. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh&#x27;s grant of land in the Selsey area and Wilfrid built his cathedral church near the entrance to Pagham Harbour, believed to be what is now Church Norton.

Cædwalla sent Wilfrid to the Isle of Wight, which was still pagan, with the aim of converting the inhabitants. The king also gave Wilfrid a quarter of the land on the island as a gift. In 688, the king relinquished his throne and went on a pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised, but died shortly after the ceremony. Wilfrid was probably influential in Cædwalla&#x27;s decision to be baptised in Rome.

During his time in Sussex Wilfrid was reconciled with Archbishop Theodore; the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid may have been involved in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.

== Return to Northumbria and exile ==

=== Return from exile ===
In 686 Wilfrid was recalled to Northumbria after the death of Ecgfrith in battle with the Picts. During the 680s Theodore had created two more dioceses in Northumbria, at Ripon, and at Abercorn in the Pictish kingdom, but both were short-lived. After Ecgfrith&#x27;s death, Theodore wrote to the new king of Northumbria, Aldfrith, and to Æthelred, king of Mercia and the Abbess of Whitby, Ælfflæd, suggesting that an agreement be made allowing Wilfrid&#x27;s return to Northumbria. Aldfrith agreed, Wilfrid returned to the north, and Bosa was removed from York. Wilfrid did not recover the whole of his previous bishopric however, as Hexham and Lindisfarne remained separate sees.

Wilfrid appears to have lived at Ripon, and for a time he acted as administrator of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert&#x27;s death in 687. In 691, the subdivision issue arose once more, along with quarrels with King Aldfrith over lands, and attempts were made to make Wilfrid either give up all his lands or to stay confined to Ripon. A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source of dispute. When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York.

Something of the reception to Wilfrid&#x27;s expulsion can be picked up in a Latin letter which has survived only in an incomplete quotation by William of Malmesbury in his &quot;Gesta pontificum Anglorum&quot;. We have it on William&#x27;s authority that the letter was written by Aldhelm of Malmesbury and addressed to Wilfrid&#x27;s abbots. In it, Aldhelm asks the clergymen to remember the exiled bishop &quot;who, nourishing, teaching, reproving, raised you in fatherly love&quot; and appealing to lay aristocratic ideals of loyalty, urges them not to abandon their superior. Neither William nor the citation itself gives a date, but the letter has been assigned to Wilfrid&#x27;s exile under Aldfrith in the 690s.

=== Mercia ===
During his stay in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop with the consent of King Æthelred. Information on Wilfrid&#x27;s life at this time is meagre, as the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; says little of this period. He is generally considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham. Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the Frisians, which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more successful than his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.

Wilfrid was present at the exhumation of the body of Queen Æthelthryth at Ely Abbey in 695. He had been her spiritual adviser in the 670s, and had helped the queen become a nun against the wishes of her husband King Ecgfrith of Northumbria. The queen had joined Ely Abbey, where she died in 679. The ceremony in 695 found that her body had not decayed, which led to her being declared a saint. Wilfrid&#x27;s testimony as to the character and virginity of Æthelthryth was recorded by Bede.

In about 700, Wilfrid appealed once more to Pope Sergius I over his expulsion from York, and the pope referred the issue back to a council in England. In 702 King Aldfrith held a council at Austerfield that upheld Wilfrid&#x27;s expulsion, and once more Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the pope. The &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; gives a speech, supposedly delivered by Wilfrid there, in defence of Wilfrid&#x27;s record over the previous 40 years. The council was presided over by Berhtwald, the new archbishop of Canterbury, and the decision of the council was that Wilfrid should be deprived of all his monasteries but Ripon, and that he should cease to perform episcopal functions. When Wilfrid continued his appeal to the papacy, his opponents had him and his supporters excommunicated.

=== Rome and final return to Northumbria ===
On his way to Rome Wilfrid stopped in Frisia to visit Willibrord. Following Wilfrid&#x27;s arrival in Rome Pope John VI held a council, which declared that the King of Northumbria should follow the earlier papal decrees restoring Wilfrid to his see. Wilfrid was disconcerted to find that the papal court spoke Greek, and his biographer noted that Wilfrid was displeased when the pope discussed the appeal with advisers in a language Wilfrid could not understand. The pope also ordered another council to be held in Britain to decide the issue, and ordered the attendance of Bosa, Berhtwald and Wilfrid. On his journey back to England Wilfrid had a seizure at Meaux, but he had returned to Kent by 705.

Aldfrith died soon after Wilfrid&#x27;s arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been considered one of Wilfrid&#x27;s friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid to stay out of Northumbria. Eadwulf&#x27;s reign lasted only a few months before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith&#x27;s son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid may have been one of Osred&#x27;s chief supporters, along with Oswiu&#x27;s daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John&#x27;s transfer from Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death.

== Other aspects ==

=== Cult of St Oswald ===

Sometime after the translation of the relics of Oswald of Northumbria to Bardney Abbey by Osthryth between 675 and 679, Wilfrid, along with Hexham Abbey, began to encourage and promote the cult of the dead king. Barbara Yorke sees this advocacy as a major factor in the prominence given to Oswald in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. Historian D. P. Kirby regards Wilfrid&#x27;s championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid&#x27;s expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald&#x27;s branch of the Northumbrian royal family over his own. One of Wilfrid&#x27;s protégés, Willibrord, became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid&#x27;s example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid&#x27;s followers.

=== Monastic network ===
Wilfrid&#x27;s network of monasteries extended across at least three of the kingdoms of England in his day. They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120 followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated that one reason for Wilfrid&#x27;s exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert.

Wilfrid was a prolific founder of churches, which he then controlled until his death, and was a great fundraiser, acquiring lands and money from many of the kings he was in contact with. He was also noted for his ability to attract support from powerful women, especially queens. Queen Eanflæd, his first patron, introduced him to a number of helpful contacts, and he later attracted the support of Queen Æthelthryth, who gave the endowment for Hexham Abbey. Ælfflæd, sister of King Aldfrith of Northumbria and daughter of Wilfrid&#x27;s old patron Queen Eanflæd, helped to persuade the Northumbrians to allow Wilfrid to return from his last exile.

=== Builder and artistic patron ===
Wilfrid built a church capable of accommodating a congregation of 2,000 at Hexham, using stone from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The 12th-century writer Ailred of Rievaulx, whose family helped restore Hexham, credited Wilfrid as the designer of a church beautifully embellished with paintings and sculpture. It appears that the churches at Hexham and Ripon (which Wilfrid also built) were aisled basilicas, of the type that was common on the continent. Ripon was the first church in Northumbria to incorporate a &quot;porticus&quot;, similar to those of churches in Kent. 12th-century pilgrims&#x27; accounts declared that the church at Hexham rivalled those of Rome. The crypts at both Ripon and Hexham are unusual, and perhaps were intended by Wilfrid to mimic the Roman catacombs which he had seen on his travels. They are still extant, although the fabric of Wilfrid&#x27;s churches above ground has been replaced by later structures. The churches were finished with glazed windows, made by glassmakers brought over from the continent.

As well as his building projects Wilfrid also commissioned works to embellish the churches, including altar cloths made of silk woven with gold threads, and a gospel book written on parchment dyed purple, with gold lettering. The gospels were then enclosed in a gold book cover set with gems. When the church he had built at Ripon was consecrated, a three-day feast was held to accompany the ceremony.

== Resignation and death ==
After his final return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at Ripon, where he lived until his death during a visit to Oundle, at the age of 75. A little over a year before his death in either 709 or 710 Wilfrid suffered another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for the disposition of his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near the altar of his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb. Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protégé who had accompanied him to Rome in 703. The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid&#x27;s death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and a spectacular white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest.

Wilfrid left large sums of money to his monastic foundations, enabling them to purchase royal favour. Soon after his death a &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;, was written by Stephen of Ripon, a monk of Ripon. The first version appeared in about 715 followed by a later revision in the 730s, the first biography written by a contemporary to appear in England. It was commissioned by two of Wilfrid&#x27;s followers, Acca of Hexham, and the Abbot of Ripon, Tatbert. Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; is concerned with vindicating Wilfrid and making a case for his sainthood, and so is used with caution by historians, although it is nevertheless an invaluable source for Wilfrid&#x27;s life and the history of the time.

== Legacy ==

Wilfrid&#x27;s feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were celebrated in early medieval England, but the April date appeared first in the liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid&#x27;s body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened at the spot where the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid&#x27;s relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod&#x27;s later poem on Wilfrid&#x27;s life. However, according to Byrhtferth&#x27;s &quot;Vita Sancti Oswaldi&quot;, or &quot;Life of Saint Oswald&quot;, Oda&#x27;s nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid&#x27;s relics were placed in their own shrine.

After the Norman Conquest of England, devotion continued to be paid to Wilfrid, with 48 churches dedicated to him and relics distributed between 11 sites. During the 19th century, the feast of Wilfrid was celebrated on the Sunday following Lammas in the town of Ripon with a parade and horse racing, a tradition which continued until at least 1908. Wilfrid is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion. He is usually depicted either as a bishop preaching and baptising or else as a robed bishop holding an episcopal staff.

Wilfrid was one of the first bishops to bring relics of saints back from Rome. The papacy was trying to prevent the removal of actual body parts from Rome, restricting collectors to things that had come in contact with the bodily remains such as dust and cloth. Wilfrid was known as an advocate of Benedictine monasticism, and regarded it as a tool in his efforts to &quot;root out the poisonous weeds planted by the Scots&quot;. He built at Ripon and Hexham, and lived a majestic lifestyle. As a result of his various exiles, he founded monastic communities that were widely scattered over the British Isles, over which he kept control until his death. These monastic foundations, especially Hexham, contributed to the blending of the Gaelic and Roman strains of Christianity in Northumbria, which inspired a great surge of learning and missionary activity; Bede and Alcuin were among the scholars who emerged from Northumbrian monasteries influenced by Wilfrid. Missionaries inspired by his example went from Northumbria to the continent, where they converted pagans in Germany and elsewhere.

One commentator has said that Wilfrid &quot;came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age&quot;. Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that &quot;Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility&quot;. The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that &quot;Wilfrid&#x27;s character was such that he seems to have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure&quot;. His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid&#x27;s devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid&#x27;s many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.

The historian Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid&#x27;s life as follows: &quot;Wilfrid left a distinctive mark on the character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, was he a man greatly interested in learning, and perhaps he would have been more at home as a member of the Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison.&quot; R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was &quot;the greatest papal enthusiast of the century&quot;. James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him &quot;He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman.&quot;

<text>Famagusta, also known by several other names, is a city located in the eastern coast Cyprus. It is located east of the capital, Nicosia, and possesses the deepest harbour of the island. During the Middle Ages (especially under the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice), Famagusta was the island&#x27;s most important port city and a gateway to trade with the ports of the Levant, from where the Silk Road merchants carried their goods to Western Europe.

==Names==
The city was known as Arsinoe or Arsinoë (, &quot;Arsinóē&quot;) in antiquity, after Ptolemy II of Egypt&#x27;s sister and wife Arsinoe II.

By the 3rd century, the city appears as Ammochostos ( or , &quot;Ammókhōstos&quot;, &quot;Hidden in Sand&quot;) in the &quot;Stadiasmus Maris Magni&quot;. This name is still used in modern Greek with the pronunciation , while it developed into Latin , French , Italian , and English during the medieval period. Its informal modern Turkish name Mağusa () came from the same source. On 25 December 1975, the formal name in Northern Cyprus was changed by an act of parliament to Gazimağusa () with the addition of the title , meaning &quot;veteran&quot;.

In the early medieval period, the city was also known as New Justiniana (, &quot;Néa Ioustinianía&quot;) in appreciation for the patronage of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, whose wife Theodora was born there.

The old town of Famagusta has also been nicknamed &quot;the City of 365 Churches&quot; from the legend that, at its peak, it boasted a church for every day of the year.

==History==
The city was founded around 274 BC, after the serious damage to Salamis by an earthquake, by Ptolemy II Philadelphus and named &quot;Arsinoe&quot; after his sister. Arsinoe was described as a &quot;fishing town&quot; by Strabo in his &quot;Geographica&quot; in the first century BC. In essence, Famagusta was the successor of the most famous and most important ancient city of Cyprus, Salamis. According to Greek mythology, Salamis was founded after the end of the Trojan War by Teucros, the son of Telamon and brother of Aedes, from the Greek island of Salamis.

===Byzantine Empire===
The city experienced great prosperity much later, during the time of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. To honor the city, from which his wife Theodora came, Justinian enriched it with many buildings, while the inhabitants named it New Justiniania to express their gratitude. In , when the neighboring cities were destroyed by Arab raiding, the inhabitants of these cities moved to Famagusta, as a result of which the city&#x27;s population increased significantly and the city experienced another boom.

===Arab conquest===
Later, when Jerusalem was occupied by the Arabs, the Christian population fled to Famagusta, as a result of which the city became an important Christian center, but also one of the most important commercial centers in the eastern Mediterranean.

===Medieval Famagusta===

The turning point for Famagusta was 1192 with the onset of Lusignan rule. It was during this period that Famagusta developed as a fully-fledged town. It increased in importance to the Eastern Mediterranean due to its natural harbour and the walls that protected its inner town. Its population began to increase. This development accelerated in the 13th century as the town became a centre of commerce for both the East and West. An influx of Christian refugees fleeing the downfall of Acre (1291) in Palestine transformed it from a tiny village into one of the richest cities in Christendom.

In 1372 the port was seized by Genoa and in 1489 by Venice. This commercial activity turned Famagusta into a place where merchants and ship owners led lives of luxury. By the mid-14th century, Famagusta was said to have the richest citizens in the world. The belief that people&#x27;s wealth could be measured by the churches they built inspired these merchants to have churches built in varying styles. These churches, which still exist, were the reason Famagusta came to be known as &quot;the district of churches&quot;. The development of the town focused on the social lives of the wealthy people and was centred upon the Lusignan palace, the cathedral, the Square and the harbour.

===Ottoman Famagusta===

In 1570–1571, Famagusta was the last stronghold in Venetian Cyprus to hold out against the Turks under Mustafa Pasha. It resisted a siege of thirteen months and a terrible bombardment, until at last the garrison surrendered. The Ottoman forces had lost 50,000 men, including Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s son. Although the surrender terms had stipulated that the Venetian forces be allowed to return home, the Venetian commander, Marco Antonio Bragadin, was flayed alive, his lieutenant Tiepolo was hanged, and many other Christians were killed.
With the advent of the Ottoman rule, Latins lost their privileged status in Famagusta and were expelled from the city. Greek Cypriots natives were at first allowed to own and buy property in the city, but were banished from the walled city in 1573–74 and had to settle outside in the area that later developed into Varosha. Turkish families from Anatolia were resettled in the walled city but could not fill the buildings that previously hosted a population of 10,000. This caused a drastic decrease in the population of Famagusta. Merchants from Famagusta, who mostly consisted of Latins that had been expelled, resettled in Larnaca and as Larnaca flourished, Famagusta lost its importance as a trade centre. Over time, Varosha developed into a prosperous agricultural town thanks to its location away from the marshes, whilst the walled city remained dilapidated.

In the walled city, some buildings were repurposed to serve the interests of the Muslim population: the Cathedral of St. Nicholas was converted to a mosque (now known as Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque), a bazaar was developed, public baths, fountains and a theological school were built to accommodate the inhabitants&#x27; needs. Dead end streets, an Ottoman urban characteristic, was imported to the city and a communal spirit developed in which a small number of two-storey houses inhabited by the small upper class co-existed with the widespread one-storey houses.

===British rule===
With the British takeover, Famagusta regained its significance as a port and an economic centre and its development was specifically targeted in British plans. As soon as the British took over the island, a Famagusta Development Act was passed that aimed at the reconstruction and redevelopment of the city&#x27;s streets and dilapidated buildings as well as better hygiene. The port was developed and expanded between 1903 and 1906 and Cyprus Government Railway, with its terminus in Famagusta, started construction in 1904. Whilst Larnaca continued to be used as the main port of the island for some time, after Famagusta&#x27;s use as a military base in World War I trade significantly shifted to Famagusta. The city outside the walls grew at an accelerated rate, with development being centred around Varosha. Varosha became the administrative centre as the British moved their headquarters and residences there and tourism grew significantly in the last years of the British rule. Pottery and production of citrus and potatoes also significantly grew in the city outside the walls, whilst agriculture within the walled city declined to non-existence.

New residential areas were built to accommodate the increasing population towards the end of the British rule, and by 1960, Famagusta was a modern port city extending far beyond Varosha and the walled city.

The British period saw a significant demographic shift in the city. In 1881, Christians constituted 60% of the city&#x27;s population while Muslims were at 40%. By 1960, the Turkish Cypriot population had dropped to 17.5% of the overall population, while the Greek Cypriot population had risen to 70%. The city was also the site for one of the British internment camps for nearly 50,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust trying to emigrate to Palestine.

===From independence to the Turkish invasion===

From independence in 1960 to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus of 1974, Famagusta developed toward the south west of Varosha as a well-known entertainment and tourist centre. The contribution of Famagusta to the country&#x27;s economic activity by 1974 far exceeded its proportional dimensions within the country. Whilst its population was only about 7% of the total of the country, Famagusta by 1974 accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus, concentrating mainly on light industry compatible with its activity as a tourist resort and turning out high-quality products ranging from food, beverages and tobacco to clothing, footwear, plastics, light machinery and transport equipment. It contributed 19.3% of the business units and employed 21.3% of the total number of persons engaged in commerce on the island. It acted as the main tourist destination of Cyprus, hosting 31.5% of the hotels and 45% of Cyprus&#x27; total bed capacity. Varosha acted as the main touristic and business quarters.

In this period, the urbanisation of Famagusta slowed down and the development of the rural areas accelerated. Therefore, economic growth was shared between the city of Famagusta and the district, which had a balanced agricultural economy, with citrus, potatoes, tobacco and wheat as main products. Famagusta maintained good communications with this hinterland. The city&#x27;s port remained the island&#x27;s main seaport and in 1961, it was expanded to double its capacity in order to accommodate the growing volume of exports and imports. The port handled 42.7% of Cypriot exports, 48.6% of imports and 49% of passenger traffic.

There has not been an official census since 1960 but the population of the town in 1974 was estimated to be around 39,000 not counting about 12,000–15,000 persons commuting daily from the surrounding villages and suburbs to work in Famagusta. The number of people staying in the city would swell to about 90,000–100,000 during the peak summer tourist period, with the influx of tourists from numerous European countries, mainly Britain, France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. The majority of the city population were Greek Cypriots (26,500), with 8,500 Turkish Cypriots and 4,000 people from other ethnic groups.

===From the Turkish reinvasion to the present===

During the second phase of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 14 August 1974 the Mesaoria plain was overrun by Turkish tanks and Famagusta was bombed by Turkish aircraft. It took two days for the Turkish Army to occupy the city, prior to which Famagusta&#x27;s entire Greek Cypriot population had fled into surrounding fields. As a result of Turkish airstrikes dozens of civilians died, including tourists.

Unlike other parts of the Turkish-controlled areas of Cyprus, the Varosha suburb of Famagusta was fenced off by the Turkish army immediately after being captured and remained fenced off until October 2020, when the TRNC reopened some streets to visitors. Some Greek Cypriots who had fled Varosha have been allowed to view the town and journalists have been allowed in.

UN Security Council resolution 550 (1984) considers any attempts to settle any part of Famagusta by people other than its inhabitants as inadmissible and unjust and calls for the transfer of this area to the administration of the UN. The UN&#x27;s Security Council resolution 789 (1992) also urges that with a view to the implementation of resolution 550 (1984), the area at present under the control of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus be extended to include Varosha.

== Cityscape==

Famagusta&#x27;s historic city centre is surrounded by the fortifications of Famagusta, which have a roughly rectangular shape, built mainly by the Venetians in the 15th and 16th centuries, though some sections of the walls have been dated earlier times, as far as 1211. Some important landmarks and visitor attractions in the old city are:
* The Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque
* The Othello Castle
* Palazzo del Provveditore - the Venetian palace of the governor, built on the site of the former Lusignan royal palace
* St. Francis&#x27; Church
* Sinan Pasha Mosque
* Church of St. George of the Greeks
* Church of St. George of the Latins
* Twin Churches
* Nestorian Church (of St George the Exiler)
* Namık Kemal Dungeon
* Agios Ioannis Church
* Venetian House
* Akkule Masjid
* Mustafa Pasha Mosque
* Ganchvor monastery

In an October 2010 report titled &quot;Saving Our Vanishing Heritage&quot;, Global Heritage Fund listed Famagusta, a &quot;maritime ancient city of crusader kings&quot;, among the 12 sites most &quot;On the Verge&quot; of irreparable loss and destruction, citing insufficient management and development pressures.

==Economy==
Famagusta is an important commercial hub of Northern Cyprus. The main economic activities in the city are tourism, education, construction and industrial production. It has a 115-acre free port, which is the most important seaport of Northern Cyprus for travel and commerce. The port is an important source of income and employment for the city, though its volume of trade is restricted by the embargo against Northern Cyprus. Its historical sites, including the walled city, Salamis, the Othello Castle and the St Barnabas Church, as well as the sandy beaches surrounding it make it a tourist attraction; efforts are also underway to make the city more attractive for international congresses. The Eastern Mediterranean University is also an important employer and supplies significant income and activity, as well as opportunities for the construction sector. The university also raises a qualified workforce that stimulates the city&#x27;s industry and makes communications industry viable. The city has two industrial zones: the Large Industrial Zone and the Little Industrial Zone. The city is also home to a fishing port, but inadequate infrastructure of the port restricts the growth of this sector. The industry in the city has traditionally been concentrated on processing agricultural products.

Historically, the port was the primary source of income and employment for the city, especially right after 1974. However, it gradually lost some of its importance to the economy as the share of its employees in the population of Famagusta diminished due to various reasons. However, it still is the primary port for commerce in Northern Cyprus, with more than half of ships that came to Northern Cyprus in 2013 coming to Famagusta. It is the second most popular seaport for passengers, after Kyrenia, with around 20,000 passengers using the port in 2013.

== Politics ==
The mayor-in-exile of Famagusta is Simos Ioannou. Süleyman Uluçay heads the Turkish Cypriot municipal administration of Famagusta, which remains legal as a communal-based body under the constitutional system of the Republic of Cyprus.

Since 1974, Greek Cypriots submitted a number of proposals within the context of bicommunal discussions for the return of Varosha to UN administration, allowing the return of its previous inhabitants, requesting also the opening of Famagusta harbour for use by both communities. Varosha would have been returned to Greek Cypriot control as part of the 2004 Annan Plan but the plan had been rejected by a majority(3/4) of Greek Cypriot voters.

==Culture==

The walled city of Famagusta contains many unique buildings. Famagusta has a walled city popular with tourists.

Every year, the International Famagusta Art and Culture Festival is organized in Famagusta. Concerts, dance shows and theater plays take place during the festival.

A growth in tourism and the city&#x27;s university have fueled the development of Famagusta&#x27;s vibrant nightlife. Nightlife in the city is especially active on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights and in the hotter months of the year, starting from April. Larger hotels in the city have casinos that cater to their customers. Salamis Road is an area of Famagusta with a heavy concentration of bars frequented by students and locals.

Famagusta&#x27;s Othello Castle is the setting for Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;. The city was also the setting for Victoria Hislop&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Sunrise,&quot; and Michael Paraskos&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;In Search of Sixpence.&quot; The city is the birthplace of the eponymous hero of the Renaissance proto-novel &quot;Fortunatus&quot;.

==Sports==

Famagusta was home to many Greek Cypriot sport teams that left the city because of the Turkish invasion and still bear their original names. Most notable football clubs originally from the city are Anorthosis Famagusta FC and Nea Salamis Famagusta FC, both of the Cypriot First Division, which are now based in Larnaca. Usually Anorthosis Famagusta fans are politically right wing where Nea Salamis fans are left wing.

Famagusta is represented by Mağusa Türk Gücü in the Turkish Cypriot First Division. Dr. Fazıl Küçük Stadium is the largest football stadium in Famagusta. Many Turkish Cypriot sport teams that left Southern Cyprus because of the Cypriot intercommunal violence are based in Famagusta.

Famagusta is represented by DAÜ Sports Club and Magem Sports Club in North Cyprus First Volleyball Division. Gazimağusa Türk Maarif Koleji represents Famagusta in the North Cyprus High School Volleyball League.

Famagusta has a modern volleyball stadium called the Mağusa Arena.

==Education==

The Eastern Mediterranean University was founded in the city in 1979. The Istanbul Technical University founded a campus in the city in 2010.

The Cyprus College of Art was founded in Famagusta by the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos in 1969, before moving to Paphos in 1972 after protests from local hoteliers that the presence of art students in the city was putting off holidaymakers.

<text>In economics, a transaction cost is a cost incurred when making an economic trade when participating in a market. 

The idea that transactions form the basis of economic thinking was introduced by the institutional economist John R. Commons in 1931. Oliver E. Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Transaction Cost Economics&quot; article, published in 2008, popularized the concept of transaction costs. Douglass C. North argues that institutions, understood as the set of rules in a society, are key in the determination of transaction costs. In this sense, institutions that facilitate low transaction costs can boost economic growth.

Alongside production costs, transaction costs are one of the most significant factors in business operation and management.

==Definition==
Williamson defines transaction costs as a cost innate in running an economic system of companies, comprising the total costs of making a transaction, including the cost of planning, deciding, changing plans, resolving disputes, and after-sales. According to Williamson, the determinants of transaction costs are frequency, specificity, uncertainty, limited rationality, and opportunistic behavior. 

Douglass North states that there are four factors that comprise transaction costs – &quot;measurement&quot;, &quot;enforcement&quot;, &quot;ideological attitudes and perceptions&quot;, and &quot;the size of the market&quot;. &quot;Measurement&quot; refers to the calculation of the value of all aspects of the good or service involved in the transaction. &quot;Enforcement&quot; can be defined as the need for an unbiased third party to ensure that neither party involved in the transaction reneges on their part of the deal. These first two factors appear in the concept of &quot;ideological attitudes and perceptions&quot;, North&#x27;s third aspect of transaction costs. Ideological attitudes and perceptions encapsulate each individual&#x27;s set of values, which influences their interpretation of the world. The final aspect of transaction costs, according to North, is &quot;market size&quot;, which affects the partiality or impartiality of transactions. 

Dahlman categorized the content of transaction activities into three broad categories:
* &quot;Search and information costs&quot; are costs such as in determining that the required good is available on the market, which has the lowest price, etc.
*&quot;Bargaining and decision costs&quot; are the costs required to come to an acceptable agreement with the other party to the transaction, drawing up an appropriate contract and so on. In game theory this is analyzed for instance in the game of chicken. On asset markets and in organizational economics, the transaction cost is some function of the distance between the supply and demand.
* &quot;Policing and enforcement costs&quot; are the costs of making sure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract, and taking appropriate action, often through the legal system, if this turns out not to be the case.
Steven N. S. Cheung defines transaction costs as any costs that are not conceivable in a &quot;Robinson Crusoe economy&quot;—in other words, any costs that arise due to the existence of institutions. For Cheung, term &quot;transaction costs&quot; are better described as &quot;institutional costs&quot;. Many economists, however, restrict this definition to exclude costs internal to an organization. 

== History ==
The idea that transactions form the basis of an economic theory was introduced by the institutional economist John R. Commons in 1931. He said that:

The term &quot;transaction cost&quot; is frequently and mistakenly thought to have been coined by Ronald Coase, who used it to develop a theoretical framework for predicting when certain economic tasks would be performed by firms, and when they would be performed on the market. While he did not coin the specific term, Coase indeed discussed &quot;costs of using the price mechanism&quot; in his 1937 paper &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot;, where he first discusses the concept of transaction costs, marking the first time that the concept of transaction costs was introduced into the study of enterprises and market organizations. The term &quot;Transaction Costs&quot; itself can be traced back to the monetary economics literature of the 1950s, and does not appear to have been consciously &#x27;coined&#x27; by any particular individual.

Transaction cost as a formal theory started in the late 1960s and early 1970s. And refers to the &quot;Costs of Market Transactions&quot; in his seminal work, &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; (1960). 

Arguably, transaction cost reasoning became most widely known through Oliver E. Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Transaction Cost Economics&quot;. Today, transaction cost economics is used to explain a number of different behaviours. Often this involves considering as &quot;transactions&quot; not only the obvious cases of buying and selling, but also day-to-day emotional interactions and informal gift exchanges. Williamson was one of the most cited social scientists at the turn of the century, and was later awarded the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.

Technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution such as distributed ledger technology and blockchains may reduce transaction costs when compared to traditional forms of contracting.

== Examples ==
A supplier may bid in a very competitive environment with a customer to build a widget. To make the widget, the supplier needs to build specialized machinery that cannot be used to make other products. Once the contract is awarded to the supplier, the relationship between customer and supplier changes from a competitive environment to a monopoly/monopsony relationship, known as a bilateral monopoly. This means that the customer has greater leverage over the supplier. To avoid these potential costs, &quot;hostages&quot; may be swapped, which may involve partial ownership in the widget factory and revenue sharing.

Car companies and their suppliers often fit into this category, with the car companies forcing price cuts on their suppliers. Defense suppliers and the military appear to have the opposite problem, with cost overruns occurring quite often. 

An example of measurement, one of North&#x27;s four factors of transaction costs, occurs when roving bandits calculate the success of their banditry based on how much money they can take from their citizens. Enforcement, the second of North&#x27;s factors of transaction costs, may take the form of a mediator in dealings with the Sicilian mafia when it is not certain that both parties will maintain their end of the deal.

== Differences from neoclassical microeconomics ==

Williamson argues in &quot;The Mechanisms of Governance&quot; (1996) that Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) differs from neoclassical microeconomics in the following points:
The transaction costs frameworks reject the notion of instrumental rationality and its implications for predicting behavior. Whereas instrumental rationality assumes that an actor&#x27;s understanding of the world is the same as the objective reality of the world, scholars who focus on transaction costs note that actors lack perfect information about the world (due to bounded rationality).

== Game theory ==
In game theory, transaction costs have been studied by Anderlini and Felli (2006). They consider a model with two parties who together can generate a surplus. Both parties are needed to create the surplus. Yet, before the parties can negotiate about dividing the surplus, each party must incur transaction costs. Anderlini and Felli find that transaction costs cause a severe problem when there is a mismatch between the parties&#x27; bargaining powers and the magnitude of the transaction costs. In particular, if a party has large transaction costs but in future negotiations it can seize only a small fraction of the surplus (i.e., its bargaining power is small), then this party will not incur the transaction costs and hence the total surplus will be lost. It has been shown that the presence of transaction costs as modelled by Anderlini and Felli can overturn central insights of the Grossman-Hart-Moore theory of the firm.

== Evaluative mechanisms ==
Oliver E. Williamson&#x27;s theory of evaluative mechanisms assess economic entitles based on eight variables: bounded rationality, atmosphere, small numbers, information asymmetric, frequency of exchange, asset specificity, uncertainty, and threat of opportunism.

* Bounded Rationality: refers to the physical and mental, intellectual, emotional and other restrictions imposed by people participating in the transaction in order to maximize their interests.
* Atmosphere: The reason for increasing the difficulty of the transaction here is mostly because both parties to the transaction remain suspicious of the transaction, and the two sides are hostile to each other. Such a relationship cannot achieve a harmonious atmosphere, let alone a harmonious transaction relationship. This will cause both parties to increase security measures and increase expenditure during the transaction process.
* Small Numbers: Because the number of the two parties is not equal, the number of available transaction objects is reduced, and the market will be dominated by a few people, which leads to higher market expenditures. The main reason here is that some deals are too proprietary.
* Information Asymmetric: The pioneers in the market will control the direction of the market, and will know the information that is more beneficial to their own development earlier, and often these information will make opportunists and uncertain environments finalized, which will form a unique information gap. so as to form a transaction and obtain a profit
* Frequency of exchange: Frequency of exchange refers to buyer activity in the market or the frequency of transactions between the parties occurs. The higher the frequency of transactions, the higher the relative administrative and bargaining costs.
* Asset specificity: Asset specificity consist of site, physical asset, and human asset specificity. The asset specific investment is a specialized investment, which does not have market liquidity. Once the contract is terminated, the asset specific investment cannot to be redeployed. Therefore, a change or termination of this transaction will result in significant loss.
* Uncertainty: Uncertainty refers to the risks that may occur in a market exchange. The increase of environmental uncertainty will be accompanied by the increase of transaction cost, such as information acquisition cost, supervision cost and bargaining cost.
* Threat of opportunism: Threat of opportunism is attributed to human nature. Opportunistic behavior of vendors can lead to higher transaction coordination costs or even termination of contracts. A company can use governance mechanism to reducing the threat of opportunism.

<text>Benedict Biscop ( – 690), also known as Biscop Baducing, was an Anglo-Saxon abbot and founder of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Priory (where he also founded the famous library) and was considered a saint after his death.

It has been suggested that Baducing appears as [[Biscop Beding]] the son of Beda Bubbing, King of Mercia in the Lyndsey/Lindfearnan lists of geneaologies held by the Anglian Collection and great-grandfather of Alfred The Great.

==Life==

===Early career===
Benedict, born of a noble Northumbrian family, was for a time a thegn of King Oswiu of Bernicia () At the age of 25 ( 653) Benedict made the first of his five trips to Rome, accompanying his friend Saint Wilfrid the Elder. However Wilfrid was detained in Lyon &quot;en route&quot;. Benedict completed the journey on his own, and when he returned to England was &quot;full of fervour and enthusiasm ... for the good of the English Church&quot;.

Benedict made a second journey to Rome twelve years later. Alchfrith of Deira, a son of King Oswiu, intended to accompany him, but the king refused to grant permission. On this trip Biscop met Acca and Wilfrid. On his return journey to England Benedict stopped at Lérins, a monastic island off the Mediterranean coast of Provence, which had by then adopted the Rule of St. Benedict. During his two-year stay there, from 665 to 667, he underwent a course of instruction, taking monastic vows and the name of &quot;Benedict&quot;.

Following the two years in Lérins Benedict made his third trip to Rome. At this time Pope Vitalian commissioned him to accompany Archbishop Theodore of Tarsus back to Canterbury in 669. On their return Archbishop Theodore appointed Benedict as abbot of SS. Peter and Paul&#x27;s, Canterbury, a role he held for two years.

===Bibliophile===
Benedict Biscop, the Bibliophile, assembled a library from his travels. His second trip to Rome had been a book-buying trip. Overall, the collection had an estimated 250 titles of mostly service books. The library included scripture, classical, and secular works.

===Founder===

Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted Benedict land in 674 for the purpose of building a monastery. He went to the Continent to bring back masons who could build a monastery in the Pre-Romanesque style. Benedict made his fifth and final trip to Rome in 679 to bring back books for a library, saintly relics, stonemasons, glaziers, and a grant from Pope Agatho granting his monastery certain privileges. Benedict made five overseas voyages in all to stock the library.

In 682 Benedict appointed Eosterwine as his coadjutor and the King was so delighted at the success of St Peter&#x27;s, he gave him land in Jarrow and urged him to build a second monastery. Benedict erected a sister foundation (St Paul) at Jarrow. He appointed Ceolfrid as the superior, who left Wearmouth with 20 monks to start the foundation in Jarrow. Bede, one of Benedict&#x27;s pupils, tells us that he brought builders and glass-workers from Francia to erect the buildings in stone.

He drew up a rule for his community, based on that of Benedict and the customs of seventeen monasteries he had visited. He also engaged Abbot John, Arch-cantor of St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome, to teach Roman chant at these monasteries.

In 685, Ecgfrith granted the land south of the River Wear to Biscop. Separated from the monastery, this would be known as the &quot;sundered land,&quot; which in time would become the name of the wider urban area.

Benedict&#x27;s idea was to build a model monastery for England, sharing his knowledge of the experience of the Church in Europe. It was the first ecclesiastical building in Britain to be built in stone, and the use of glass was a novelty for many in 7th-century England. It eventually possessed what was a large library for the time – several hundred volumes – and it was here that Benedict&#x27;s student Bede wrote his famous works. The library became world-famous and manuscripts that had been copied there became prized possessions throughout Europe, including especially the Codex Amiatinus, the earliest surviving manuscript of the complete Bible in the Latin Vulgate version.

===Death===
For the last three years of his life Benedict was bed-ridden. He suffered his affliction with great patience and faith. He died on 12 January 690.

===Veneration===
A sermon of Bede (Homily 17) indicates that there was a very early public cult of Biscop; for his feast, but it became more widespread only after the translation of his relics to Thorney under Ethelwold . He is recognised as a saint by the Christian Church, which holds his feast day on 12 January.

Benedict is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 12 January. The parish church in Wombourne, Staffordshire is the only one in England dedicated to Benedict.

The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates him as a saint and celebrates his feast day on 12th January on the New Calendar.

<doc id="145299" wikidata="Q1314988" url="?curid=145299" title="Roche Abbey">
<text>Roche Abbey is a now-ruined abbey in the civil parish of Maltby, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. It is in the valley of Maltby Dyke, known locally as Maltby Beck, and is administered by English Heritage. It is a scheduled monument and Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Early history==

The abbey was founded in 1147 when the stone buildings were raised on the north side of the beck. The co-founders of Roche were Richard de Busli, likely the great-nephew of the first Roger de Busli, the Norman magnate builder of Tickhill Castle, and Richard FitzTurgis. According to the Monasticon Anglicanum, the two Richards gave land to the monks on each side of the stream on the understanding that abbey should be built on whichever side was considered most stable for building and that both of them would receive as much credit as the other, with the one whose land was rejected being held to the same level of thanks, regardless of whose side of the stream it was built on.

When the monks first arrived in South Yorkshire from Newminster Abbey in Northumberland, they chose the most suitable side of the stream that runs through the valley to build their new Cistercian monastery. Twenty-five years later, at the end of the century, the Norman Gothic great church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, had been finished, as well as most of the other buildings. The control of the abbey was vested in the de Vesci family, lords of Rotherham, who in turn subfeuded the land to Richard FitzTurgis, lord of Wickersley (and who took Wickersley as his surname).

From the start, the Abbey of Roche, built for the so-called White Monks, as the Cistercians were known, had an almost otherworldly air. It was, after all, built at the northern end of an area once covered by Sherwood Forest, and it was said that Robin Hood went to Mass here. (A diocesan pilgrimage is still made today on Trinity Sunday.) At its height it supported a community of around 175 men, of whom about 60 were choir monks, the remainder being lay brothers, a Cistercian innovation.

Eventually, on the death of co-founder FitzTurgis, control of the abbey passed to his son Roger, now &#x27;de Wickersley&#x27;, and then eventually to a granddaughter Constantia, who married William de Livet (Levett), a family of Norman origin who were lords of the nearby village of Hooton Levitt (or Levett). The abbey continued in the Levett family until 1377, when John Levett sold his rights in the abbey to the London merchant Richard Barry. By the time of the dissolution full control of Roche Abbey was held by Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, who came in for numerous grants at the Dissolution as he was married to the niece of King Henry VIII.

==Despoliation==

The Roche Abbey records have been either lost or destroyed, so there are no accounts of the abbey&#x27;s activities, other than that there were 14 monks and an unknown number of novices at the time of the dissolution by Henry VIII on 23 June 1538. It was this that led to the abbey being reduced to ruins, although the surviving parts of the walls of the north and south transepts are still impressive. The local community at time of the dissolution decided they had first right of claim on Roche Abbey and its possessions. Timber, lead and stone were also removed in vast quantities.

Between 1567–1591, Michael Sherbrook wrote an influential account of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, &quot;The Falle of Religiouse Howses, Colleges, Chantreys, Hospitalls, &amp;c&quot;. Sherbrook was rector of nearby Wickersley while writing, and included a section on Roche Abbey. Sherbrook was a child at the time of the suppression and the account, &quot;the most complete from any religious institution in England&quot;, was related to Sherbook by his uncle who had been present at the spoliation of the abbey.

Sherbook&#x27;s account gives the impression of a frenzy with looting by locals, and that the spoliation at Roche Abbey happened in a short space of time. Reassessment of the source and comparison with the treatment of other religious houses suggests a more organised and structured approach, with lead from the roofs likely removed by Cromwell&#x27;s men. A grant of 1546 mentions valuable materials, such as lead and glass, still on the site which the archaeologist Hugh Willmott suggests indicates that the process of spoliation took a longer time than implied by Sherbook.

Left in ruin, the land passed through many private hands until the 4th Earl of Scarbrough decided it needed revitalising to enhance his adjoining family seat at Sandbeck Park. Lord Scarborough enlisted the talents of Capability Brown. With an astonishing disregard for history, Brown demolished buildings, built large earth mounds and turfed the whole site. Until the end of the 19th century Roche Abbey remained buried beneath Brown&#x27;s work and wooded parkland. But subsequent excavation in the 1920s returned Roche to its former splendour.

==The abbey today==
The site is now in the care of English Heritage. The cliff path walk provides access to a view across the abbey grounds where its layout can be appreciated. Many of the buildings are low-standing but the walls of the church still stand to full height and the gothic French idealism thrust into its design and architecture is visible. Later additions to the buildings included a kitchen area and abbot&#x27;s quarters, built on the other side of the beck and accessed by a bridge which still stands. The monks&#x27; latrines were over Maltby Beck so the running water took away the waste. The stream was dammed higher up to ensure fast-flowing water: quite a modern facility for the 13th century. There are several local legends concerning ghosts, tunnels to other buildings, and even a lost wishing well.

==Burials at the abbey==

The nave was the burial place for the lay brothers but others outside the immediate abbey community buried here include Peryn of Doncaster and his wife, Ysabel. There is also a tomb of the 14th-century Rilston family, presumably local worthies.

<text>Robert Raikes (&quot;the Younger&quot;) (14 September 1735 – 5 April 1811) was an English philanthropist and Anglican layman. He was educated at The Crypt School in Gloucester. He was noted for his promotion of Sunday schools.

==Family==
Raikes was born at Ladybellegate House, Gloucester, in 1736, the eldest child of Mary Drew and Robert Raikes, a newspaper publisher. He was baptised on 24 September 1736 at St Mary de Crypt Church in Gloucester. On 23 December 1767 he married Anne Trigge, with whom he had three sons and seven daughters: their oldest son, the Rev. Robert Napier Raikes, was the father of General Robert Napier Raikes of the Indian Army, while another son, William Henley Raikes, was a colonel in the Coldstream Guards and fought for the British in the Napoleonic Wars. Raikes&#x27;s great-granddaughter Caroline Alice Roberts (1848–1920) was a fiction writer who married the composer Sir Edward Elgar.

==Sunday schools==

Robert was a pioneer of the Sunday school movement, although he did not start the first Sunday School. Some already existed such as that founded by Hannah Ball in High Wycombe, or the one founded in 1751 in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham which is the first documented known case.

He inherited a publishing business from his father, becoming proprietor of the &quot;Gloucester Journal&quot; in 1757. He then moved the business into Robert Raikes&#x27; House in 1758. The movement started with a school for boys in the slums. Raikes had become interested in prison reform, specifically with the conditions in Gloucester gaol and saw that vice would be better prevented than cured. He saw schooling as the best intervention. The best available time was Sunday as the boys were often working in the factories the other six days. The best available teachers were lay people. The textbook was the Bible, and the originally intended curriculum started with learning to read and then progressed to the catechism.
 
Raikes used the paper to publicise the schools and bore most of the cost in the early years. The movement began in July 1780 in the home of a Mrs Meredith. Only boys attended, and she heard the lessons of the older boys who coached the younger. Later, girls also attended. Within two years, several schools opened in and around Gloucester. He published an account on 3 November 1783 of Sunday schools in his paper, and later word of the work spread through the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and in 1784, a letter to the &quot;Arminian Magazine&quot;.

The original schedule for the schools, as written by Raikes was &quot;The children were to come after ten in the morning, and stay till twelve; they were then to go home and return at one; and after reading a lesson, they were to be conducted to Church. After Church, they were to be employed in repeating the catechism till after five, and then dismissed, with an injunction to go home without making a noise.&quot;

There were disputes about the movement in the early years. The schools were derisively called &quot;Raikes&#x27; Ragged School&quot;. Criticisms raised included that it would weaken home-based religious education, that it might be a desecration of the Sabbath, and that Christians should not be employed on the Sabbath. Some leading ecclesiastics—among them Bishop Samuel Horsley—opposed them on the grounds that they might become subservient to purposes of political propagandism. &quot;Sabbatarian disputes&quot; in the 1790s led many Sunday schools to cease their teaching of writing. Notwithstanding all this, Adam Smith gave the movement his strongest commendation: &quot;No plan has promised to effect a change of manners with equal ease and simplicity since the days of the Apostles.&quot;

Despite the controversy, the Sunday Schools grew at a phenomenal rate. By 1788 there were 300,000 children attached to local Sunday Schools. By 1831, Sunday schools in Great Britain were teaching weekly 1,250,000 children, approximately 25 percent of the population. By 1910 there were over 5,500,000 in Sunday Schools throughout the UK. As these schools preceded the first state funding of schools for the general public, they are seen as the forerunners of the current English school system.

<text>Howell Harris (; 23 January 1714 – 21 July 1773) was a Calvinistic Methodist evangelist. He was one of the main leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century, along with Daniel Rowland and William Williams Pantycelyn.

==Life==

Harris was born at Trefeca, near Talgarth in Brecknockshire on 23 January 1714. He was the youngest of five children of Howel ap Howel, alias Harris (c. 1672–1731), a carpenter, and his wife, Susannah (died 1751), daughter of Thomas Powell. The family originally hailed from Carmarthenshire, but had settled in Trefeca in 1700, where Howell Sr had purchased a small landholding. Harris&#x27;s oldest brother Joseph trained as a blacksmith, but went on to secure a post at the Royal Mint after studying in London. His other brother Thomas made his name as a tailor to wealthy clients and amassed enough income to purchase estates in Tregunter and Trefeca, and other properties nearby. He served as High Sheriff of Brecknockshire in 1768.

Harris underwent religious conversion in March 1735 after hearing a parish-church sermon by the Rev. Pryce Davies on the Sunday before Easter, on the necessity of partaking of Holy Communion. This led to several weeks of self-examination, which reached a climax at Communion on Whit Sunday, May 1735. After what is described as answering the devil&#x27;s accusations, he received Communion and became convinced he had received mercy through the blood of Christ, which gave him a sense of great joy. He immediately began to tell others of this and hold meetings in his home to encourage others to seek the same assurance of Christ&#x27;s forgiveness.

He failed to be accepted for ordination in the Church of England because of views held to be &quot;Methodist&quot;. Instead he became a travelling preacher, tirelessly determined to spread the word through Wales. His preaching often led him into personal danger, persecution and hardship before he gained a following. From 1738 he was supported by Marmaduke Gwynne, a local squire and early convert.

In 1750 Harris retreated to his home at Trefeca, having fallen out with a fellow evangelist, Daniel Rowland, and become the subject of public scandal for his close friendship with &quot;Madam&quot; Sidney Griffith. In 1752 he was inspired by the example of the Moravians to found a religious community there known as &quot;Teulu Trefeca&quot; (The Trefeca family) with himself as &quot;Father&quot;.

Harris had not given up preaching and resumed his former activities in 1763, after a reconciliation with Rowland. He died ten years later and was buried close to his birthplace at Talgarth, where 20,000 people are said to have attended his funeral. There is a memorial to him at Rhydyclafdy, near Pwllheli, where he preached.

He was effectively the founder of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, also known as the Calvinistic Methodist Church.

==The papers of Howell Harris==
Harris kept a detailed diary and carefully filed the letters he sent and received during his ministry. His papers offer a first-hand account of the Welsh Methodist revival. After his death, they were left to gather dust for over a century before O. M. Edwards, in the 1880s, noted their importance and suggested they ought to be cared for. By this time, the former home of Harris at Trefeca had been turned into a college, whose deputy head, Edwin Williams, took on the task of putting the papers in order. They were kept there until 1910, when the Presbyterian Church of Wales, as their ostensible owner, decided to set up a committee to take care of them and study them.

By 1913 the scale of the work needing to be done on the papers became apparent. Many of the papers were in Latin, and it was estimated that it would take much of a decade and a vast sum of money to ready them for publication. In 1913, it was decided it would be a better use of resources to set up a Historical Society of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, which would publish a regular journal that would include some of Harris&#x27;s papers.

Probably around 1932, the papers were moved from Trefeca to the denomination&#x27;s theological college in Aberystwyth. These papers, along with others from Coleg y Bala (an old college of the denomination in Bala, North Wales), were taken in 1934 to be stored safely at the National Library of Wales. There the papers remain in the vaults to this day. Revd Dr Geraint Tudur (son of R. Tudur Jones), formerly Lecturer in Church History at University of Wales, Bangor, and subsequently General Secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, published a biography: &quot;Howell Harris: From Conversion to Separation, 1735–1750&quot; (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000).

<text>William Williams, Pantycelyn (c. 11 February 1717 – 11 January 1791), also known as William Williams, Williams Pantycelyn, and Pantycelyn, was generally seen as Wales&#x27;s premier hymnist. He is also rated among the great literary figures of Wales, as a writer of poetry and prose. In religion he was among the leaders of the 18th-century Welsh Methodist revival, along with the evangelists Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland.

==Life==

Williams was born in 1717 at Cefn-coed farm in the parish of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn near Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, the son of John and Dorothy Williams. John died in 1742 and Dorothy later moved to the nearby farm of Pantycelyn (&quot;Holly Hollow&quot;). William Williams himself is often referred to as Pantycelyn.

The family were Nonconformists. He was educated locally and then at a nonconformist academy near Talgarth. He had intended to study medicine, but this changed in 1737–1738, when he was converted by the preaching of the evangelical Methodist revivalist Howell Harris in Talgarth.

For much of his life, Williams lived in the parish of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn. He died at Pantycelyn in January 1791 at the age of 74 and is buried in Llanfair-ar-y-bryn churchyard. He is also commemorated by a memorial chapel in Llandovery.

==Religious figure==

William Williams felt called to the priesthood; and in 1740, despite his family&#x27;s links with the Nonconformist branch of Christianity, he took deacon&#x27;s orders in the Established Anglican Church. (Since disestablishment in 1920, the Anglican church in Wales has been known as the Church in Wales.)

His first appointment was as curate to Theophilus Evans (1693–1767) in the parishes of Llanwrtyd, Llanfihangel Abergwesyn and Llanddewi Abergwesyn. Around this time he became involved in the Methodist movement and in June 1742 his disapproving parishioners reported his activities to the Archdeacon&#x27;s Court in Brecon. Methodism was originally a reformist faction within the Church of England and was not intended to be a separatist movement or church. It was nevertheless seen as a threat to the Anglican establishment, and in 1743, when Williams duly applied for ordination as a priest, his application was refused because of his Methodist connection. Rather than a comfortable, conformist career in the Anglican Church, he chose a financially precarious, but perhaps spiritually richer life as a Methodist preacher.

The key years in the foundation of English Methodism were between 1739, when the brothers Charles and John Wesley, both Anglican priests, broke with the Moravian church and set up their own first chapel in Bristol, and 1743, when they drew up their &quot;General Rules&quot;. This was, unfortunately, the very time that Williams was beginning his own career in the Church and partly explains the hostility he experienced from his congregation and from the hierarchy. Williams paid a higher price for his beliefs than did the Wesleys. Williams was shut out of the Establishment at the start of his career, whilst the Wesleys had already been ordained.

Welsh Methodism predates 1739 and can be traced back to the conversions of the two main leaders of the Welsh Methodists, Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland, in 1735. It was an indigenous, parallel movement to its sister movement in England, and the Welsh Methodists were mainly Calvinists, who worked much more closely with George Whitefield than they did with John Wesley.

Charles Wesley declared that his own Methodism was not incompatible with his Anglicanism and he was buried as an Anglican. John Wesley&#x27;s doctrine was more favourable to Arminianism than to Calvinism. In Wales, however, most Methodists followed Calvinist teaching, and this led to great tensions between the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists and the Wesleyan Methodists, especially after the Wesleyan Methodists began actively evangelising in Welsh-speaking Wales from 1800 onwards. In 1811, the Welsh Calvinist Methodists, now usually called the Presbyterian Church of Wales, seceded from the Anglican Church and ordained their own ministers. Had he lived a little longer, Williams Pantycelyn would no doubt have approved of these moves, because as a Methodist, he himself became a firm advocate of Calvinist Reformation doctrine and frequently invoked stern warnings against Arminianism, Arianism, Socinianism, Sandemanianism and other teachings. [&quot;See:&quot; G. T. Hughes: p. 7].

Williams Pantycelyn travelled throughout Wales (he is said to have partly supported his ministry by selling tea) preaching the doctrine of Calvinistic Methodism. He needed to be not only a theologian and an advocate for the new Connexion, but also an organiser and administrator. His converts gathered in (fellowship meetings). Williams had to organise, and then maintain, these as he went around the country. Each successful visit to a new locality in turn required a new . Although he was not alone in his mission, the workload and mental burden must have been considerable. By the same token, it must have been deeply rewarding to see the community grow and thrive over the years and to reflect on the alternative life he had forsaken, as the priest of some obscure rural Anglican parish in mid-Wales.

Together with Harris and Rowland, William Williams &quot;Pantycelyn&quot; is acknowledged as a leader of the Methodist Revival in Wales in the 18th century and as the &quot;literary voice&quot; &quot;par excellence&quot; of that movement.

==Literary figure==

William Williams Pantycelyn was not merely an important figure in the religious life in Wales, he was also one of the most important influences on Welsh language culture, not just in his own lifetime, but on into the 19th and 20th centuries. He is particularly known as a hymn writer and his ability earned him the accolade (&#x27;The Sweet Songster&#x27;), echoing the description of King David as &quot;the sweet psalmist of Israel&quot; ().

His literary output has been analysed in Saunders Lewis&#x27;s book &quot;Williams Pantycelyn&quot; (1927).

===Hymns===
He wrote some of his work in English, but the great majority in his native Welsh. He published his first work in 1744: this was the first part of , a collection of hymns in Welsh. It was followed by further collections:
*1751: (Hosannah to the Son of David). 
*1759: (Some hymns and divine songs).
*1762: (The songs of those on the crystal sea).
*1763: (Farewell seen, and welcome unseen things).
*1771: &quot;Gloria in excelsis&quot;.
*1772: &quot;O&#x27;er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness&quot;
*1774: (A few hymns).
*1782: (Some new hymns).

He also published two collections of English hymns:
*1759: &quot;Hosannah to the son of David&quot;.
*1772: &quot;Gloria in excelsis&quot;.

Undoubtedly his best known hymn is &quot;&quot; (in English, &quot;Lord, lead thou through the wilderness&quot;). This was soon translated into English by Peter Williams: &quot;Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah&quot; or &quot;Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer&quot;. It is usually sung to the tune &quot;Cwm Rhondda&quot; by John Hughes.

===Poetry===
His hymns were not his only major contribution to the success of Calvinistic Methodism. He wrote two long poems on theological and religious themes:
*1756: (A view of Christ&#x27;s kingdom). The history of salvation and God&#x27;s grace in Christ. 
*1764: (Life and death of Theomemphus). The religious experience of conversion and Christian living.

He also wrote a series of elegies in memory of various Methodist and other Christian leaders, including: Griffith Jones of Llanddowror, Howel Davies (the Pembrokeshire preacher), George Whitefield, and Daniel Rowland.

===Prose works===
Williams wrote original prose works and also translated others from English. Most were intended to assist the members of the Methodist fellowships he established.

He wrote about the 1762 Revival:
*1762: (Martha Philopur&#x27;s letter to the Reverend Philo Evangelius her teacher), followed by:
*1763: (Philo-Evangelius&#x27;s reply to Martha Philopur). 
These works were intended to defend and teach the significance of the 1762 revival at Llangeitho. 
The 1762 revival was a powerful one, which manifested its power physically. As a result, Methodists in Wales were often known as Jumpers.

*1762 to 1779: (Pantheologia, or a History of all the World&#x27;s Religions).
*1767: (Crocodile of the River of Egypt).
*1768: (A history of the life and death of three men of Sodom and Egypt).
*1774: (Aurora Borealis: The Northern Lights).

He wrote practical guides for a Christian life:
*1777: (Teacher of the Nuptials or the marriage guide), and:
*1777: (A gateway to the experience meeting).
These were for the converts who were members of the or societies.

<text>The Wartburg () is a castle originally built in the Middle Ages. It is situated on a precipice of to the southwest of and overlooking the town of Eisenach, in the state of Thuringia, Germany. It was the home of St. Elisabeth of Hungary, the place where Martin Luther translated the New Testament of the Bible into German, the site of the Wartburg festival of 1817 and the supposed setting for the possibly legendary &quot;Sängerkrieg&quot;. It was an important inspiration for Ludwig II when he decided to build Neuschwanstein Castle. 

Wartburg is the most visited tourist attraction in Thuringia after Weimar. Although the castle today still contains substantial original structures from the 12th through 15th centuries, much of the interior dates back only to the 19th century. In 1999, Wartburg Castle was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its quintessential medieval architecture and its historical and religious significance.

==Etymology==
The name of the castle is probably derived from , a watchtower, in spite of a tradition which holds that the castle&#x27;s founder, on first laying eyes on the site, exclaimed, &quot;Warte, Berg—du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!&quot; (&quot;Wait, mountain—you shall bear my castle!&quot;). It is a German play on words for mountain (&quot;Berg&quot;) and fortress (&quot;Burg&quot;), coupled with a further play on &quot;warte&quot; (wait) and &quot;Warte&quot; (&quot;watchtower&quot;).

==Location==

Wartburg is located on a precipice to the southwest of, and overlooking the town of Eisenach, in the state of Thuringia, Germany. The hill is an extension of Thuringian Forest, overlooking &quot;Mariental&quot; to the south-east and the valley of the Hörsel to the north, through which passed the historical Via Regia. The Rennsteig passes not far to the south of the castle.

== History ==
The castle&#x27;s foundation was laid about 1067 by the Thuringian count of Schauenburg, Louis the Springer ( &quot;Ludwig der Springer&quot; ), a relative of the Counts of Rieneck in Franconia. Together with its larger sister castle Neuenburg in the present-day town of Freyburg, the Wartburg secured the extreme borders of his traditional territories.
Louis the Springer is said to have had clay from his lands transported to the top of the hill, which was not quite within his lands, so he might swear that the castle was built on his soil.

The castle was first mentioned in a written document in 1080 by Bruno, Bishop of Merseburg, in his &quot;De Bello Saxonico&quot; (&quot;The Saxon War&quot;) as &quot;Wartberg&quot;.

During the Investiture Controversy, Louis&#x27;s henchmen attacked a military contingent of King Henry IV of Germany. The count remained a fierce opponent of the Salian rulers, and upon the extinction of the line, his son Louis I was elevated to the rank of a Landgrave in Thuringia by the new German king Lothair of Supplinburg in 1131.

From 1172 to 1211, the Wartburg was one of the most important princes&#x27; courts in the German Reich. Hermann I supported poets like Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach who wrote part of his &quot;Parzival&quot; here in 1203.

The castle thus became the setting for the legendary &quot;Sängerkrieg&quot;, or Minstrels&#x27; Contest in which such &quot;Minnesänger&quot; as Walther von der Vogelweide, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Albrecht von Halberstadt (the translator of Ovid) and many others supposedly took part in 1206/1207. The legend of this event was later used by Richard Wagner in his opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

At the age of four, St. Elisabeth of Hungary was sent by her mother to the Wartburg to be raised to become consort of Landgrave Ludwig IV of Thuringia. From 1211 to 1228, she lived in the castle and was renowned for her charitable work. In 1221, Elisabeth married Ludwig. In 1227, Ludwig died on the Crusade and she followed her confessor Father Konrad to Marburg. Elisabeth died there in 1231 at the age of 24 and was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church just five years after her death.

In 1247, Heinrich Raspe, the last landgrave of Thuringia of his line and an anti-king of Germany, died at the Wartburg. He was succeeded by Henry III, Margrave of Meissen.

In 1320, substantial reconstruction work was done after the castle had been damaged in a fire caused by lightning in 1317 or 1318. A chapel was added to the Palas.

The Wartburg remained the seat of the Thuringian landgraves until 1440.

From May 1521 to March 1522, Martin Luther stayed at the castle under the name of &quot;Junker Jörg&quot; (the Knight George), after he had been taken there for his safety at the request of Frederick the Wise following his excommunication by Pope Leo X and his refusal to recant at the Diet of Worms. It was during this period that Luther translated the New Testament from ancient Greek into German in just ten weeks. Luther&#x27;s was not the first German translation of the Bible but it quickly became the most well known and most widely circulated.

From 1540 until his death in 1548, , an Anabaptist farmer from Herda, was held captive in the dungeon of the south tower, because he refused to abjure anabaptism. After his death, he was buried in the Wartburg near the chapel of St. Elisabeth. In 1925, a handwritten signature of Fritz Erbe was found on the prison wall.

Over the next centuries, the castle fell increasingly into disuse and disrepair, especially after the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War when it had served as a refuge for the ruling family.
In 1777, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stayed at the Wartburg for five weeks, making various drawings of the buildings.
On 18 October 1817, the first Wartburg festival took place. About 500 students, members of the newly founded German Burschenschaften (&quot;fraternities&quot;), came together at the castle to celebrate the German victory over Napoleon four years before and the 300th anniversary of the Reformation, condemn conservatism and call for German unity under the motto &quot;Honour - Freedom - Fatherland&quot;. Speakers at the event included Heinrich Hermann Riemann, a veteran of the Lützow Free Corps, the philosophy student Ludwig Rödiger, and Hans Ferdinand Massmann.

With the permission of the absent chaplain Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, the Code Napoléon and other books were burned &#x27;in effigy&#x27;: instead of the costly volumes, scraps of parchment with the titles of conservative books (including August von Kotzebue&#x27;s &quot;History of the German Empires&quot;) were placed on the bonfire. Karl Ludwig Sand, who would assassinate Kotzebue two years later, was among the participants.

This event and a similar gathering at Wartburg during the Revolutions of 1848 are considered seminal moments in the movement for German unification.

During the rule of the House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Grand Duke Karl Alexander ordered the reconstruction of Wartburg in 1838. The lead architect was , for whom it became a life&#x27;s work. In fact, it was finished only a year after his death in 1889.

Drawing on a suggestion by Goethe that the Wartburg would serve well as a museum, Maria Pavlovna and her son Karl Alexander also founded the art collection (&quot;Kunstkammer&quot;) that became the nucleus of today&#x27;s museum.

The reign of the House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach ended in the German Revolution in 1918. In 1922, the &quot;Wartburg Stiftung&quot; (Wartburg Foundation) was established to ensure the castle&#x27;s maintenance.

After the end of World War II, Soviet occupation forces took the renowned collection of weapons and armour. Its whereabouts still remain unknown. The &quot;&quot; (the armoury) of the Wartburg used to contain a notable collection of about 800 pieces, from the splendid armour of King Henry II of France, to the items of Frederick the Wise, Pope Julius II and Bernhard von Weimar. All these objects were taken by the Soviet Occupation Army in 1946 and have disappeared in the Soviet Union. Two helmets, two swords, a prince&#x27;s and a boy&#x27;s armour, however, were found in a temporary store at the time and a few pieces were given back by the USSR in the 1960s. The new Russian Government has been petitioned to help locate the missing treasures.

Under communist rule during the time of the GDR extensive reconstruction took place in 1952-54. In particular, much of the palas was restored to its original Romanesque style. A new stairway was erected next to the palas.

In 1967, the castle was the site of celebrations of the GDR&#x27;s national jubilee, the 900th anniversary of the Wartburg&#x27;s foundation, the 450th anniversary of the beginning of Luther&#x27;s Reformation and the 150th anniversary of the Wartburg Festival.

In 1983, it was the central point of the celebrations on account of the 500th birthday of Martin Luther.

== Architecture ==
===Palas===

The largest structure of the Wartburg is the &quot;Palas&quot;, originally built in late Romanesque style between 1157 and 1170. It is considered the best-preserved non-ecclesial Romanesque building north of the Alps.

The Palas features rooms like the &quot;Rittersaal&quot; and the &quot;Speisesaal&quot; which have been reconstructed as closely as possible to the original Romanesque style and which contain original structures (pillars or roof elements). However, many of the rooms mostly reflect the tastes of the 19th and 20th centuries and the image of the Middle Ages prevalent at the time: the &quot;Elisabeth-Kemenate&quot; was fitted with mosaics showing the life of St. Elisabeth (created in 1902–06) on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the &quot;Sängersaal&quot; (with frescoes of the &quot;Sängerkrieg&quot; by Moritz von Schwind) and the &quot;Festssaal&quot; on the top floor. The latter also features frescoes by Schwind (on the triumph of Christianity) and served as the inspiration for the &quot;Sängerhalle&quot; at Neuschwanstein Castle. The Wartburg&#x27;s &quot;Sängersaal&quot; is the setting for Act II of Tannhäuser. None of the wallpaintings, including those in the &quot;Landgrafenzimmer&quot; or the &quot;Elisabethengalerie&quot;, are actually medieval in origin, but were created in the 19th century.

===Other structures===
The drawbridge and barbican offer the only access to the castle and have been largely unchanged since medieval times.

&quot;Vorburg&quot; is the area immediately inside the first gate. It dates to the 14th/15th century and is made up of several half-timbered buildings: the &quot;Elisabethengang&quot; (covered walkway), the &quot;Vogtei&quot; (Bailiff&#x27;s lodge), the &quot;Margarethengang&quot; (covered walkway) and the &quot;Ritterhaus&quot; (Knights&#x27; House).

The &quot;Lutherstube&quot; in the &quot;Vogtei&quot;, where Martin Luther stayed when he was in the castle, also features paintings by Lucas Cranach.

The &quot;Bergfried&quot; (donjon) was completed in 1859 and sits on the foundations of a medieval keep. It is topped by a landmark three-meter-tall .

The &quot;Neue Kemenate&quot; (New Bower, 1853–1860) today exhibits the art treasures of the Wartburgsammlung, including paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder and sculptures from the workshop of Tilman Riemenschneider.

The Romanesque &quot;Südturm&quot; or South Tower was built in 1318. Together with the Palas it is the oldest part of the castle. A dungeon is located below.

In 1999, UNESCO added Wartburg Castle to the World Heritage List as an &quot;Outstanding Monument of the Feudal Period in Central Europe&quot;, citing its &quot;Cultural Values of Universal Significance&quot;.

For a while, the status of Wartburg as a World Heritage site was endangered by plans to build very tall wind turbines on Milmesberg near Marksuhl. However, in November 2013, the investor agreed not to build the turbines and a regional planning update has banned such structures within sight of Wartburg in the future.

==Today==
Wartburg is a popular tourist destination, the most-visited site in Thuringia after Weimar. It is accessible to visitors and guided tours offer access to the interior of the buildings. In addition, there is a museum in the castle. Children can ride donkeys up the hill. The &quot;Festsaal&quot; is used regularly for staging the opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, as well as concerts and other events. There is also a hotel, located right next to the castle, originally built during the castle&#x27;s reconstruction in the 19th century.

Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States, visited the Wartburg castle, as well as the Bach House, on 14 May 1998 during his state visit to Germany.

== Legacy ==
For centuries, the Wartburg has been a place of pilgrimage for many people from within and outside Germany, for its significance in German history and in the development of Christianity. Several places (especially US towns founded by Lutherans) and a local brand of automobile have been named after the Wartburg. Wartburg College in Iowa, United States, is named in commemoration of Martin Luther&#x27;s receiving refuge at the castle and because of the college&#x27;s forest location and its Thuringian heritage. Wartburg Theological Seminary, also located in Iowa was named in commemoration of Wartburg Castle. The main complex at Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary resembles the Wartburg.

The Wartburgkreis is named after the castle, although Wartburg is located outside the district. Eisenach, originally part of the district, became &quot;kreisfrei&quot; (&quot;district-free&quot;) in 1998.

<text>Ecgfrith (; ; 64520 May 685) was the King of Northumbria from 670 until his death on 20 May 685. He ruled over Northumbria when it was at the height of its power, but his reign ended with a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Nechtansmere against the Picts of Fortriu in which he lost his life.

==Early life==
Ecgfrith was born in 645 or less likely 646 to king Oswiu of Northumbria and his wife Eanflæd. At about the age of 10, Ecgfrith was held as a hostage at the court of Queen Cynewise, wife of King Penda of Mercia. Penda was eventually defeated and killed in the Battle of the Winwaed by Oswiu, a victory which greatly enhanced Northumbrian power. To secure his hegemony over other English kingdoms Oswiu arranged a marriage between Ecgfrith and Æthelthryth, a daughter of Anna of East Anglia.

==King of Northumbria==
In 671, Ecgfrith defeated the Picts at the Battle of Two Rivers, and as a result in the Northumbrians took control of Pictland for the next fourteen years. Around the same time, Æthelthryth wished to leave Ecgfrith to become a nun. Eventually, in about 672, Æthelthryth persuaded Ecgfrith to allow her to become a nun, and she entered the monastery of the Abbess Æbbe, who was aunt to King Ecgfrith, at Coldingham. A year later, Æthelthryth became founding abbess of Ely. Her taking the veil may have led to a long quarrel with Wilfrid, Bishop of York, which ended with Wilfrid&#x27;s expulsion from his Episcopal see. Ecgfrith married as his second wife Eormenburg (or Iurminburh). She and Bishop Wilfrid became bitter enemies.

In 674, Ecgfrith repelled the Mercian king Wulfhere, which enabled him to seize the Kingdom of Lindsey. In 679, he fought the Mercians again, now under Wulfhere&#x27;s brother Æthelred who was married to Ecgfrith&#x27;s sister Osthryth, at the Battle of the Trent. Ecgfrith&#x27;s own brother Ælfwine was killed in the battle and following intervention by Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lindsey was returned to the Mercians.

In June 684, Ecgfrith sent a raiding party to Brega in Ireland under his general Berht, which resulted in the seizing of a large number of slaves and the sacking of many churches and monasteries. The reasons for this raid are unclear, though it is known that Ecgfrith acted against the warnings of Ecgberht of Ripon and that the raid was condemned by Bede and other churchmen.

In 685, against the advice of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, Ecgfrith led a force against the Picts of Fortriu, who were led by his cousin Bridei mac Bili. On 20 May, Ecgfrith was slain at the age of 40, having been lured by a feigned flight to the mountains, at what is now called the Battle of Dun Nechtain, located at either Dunnichen in Angus or Dunachton in Badenoch. This defeat, in which most of Ecgfrith&#x27;s army was lost, severely weakened Northumbrian power in the north and Bede dates the beginning of the decline of the kingdom of Northumbria from Ecgfrith&#x27;s death and wrote that following Ecgfrith&#x27;s death, &quot;the hopes and strengths of the English realm began &#x27;to waver and to slip backward ever lower&#x27;&quot;. The Northumbrians never regained the dominance of central Britain lost in 679; nor of northern Britain lost in 685. Nevertheless, Northumbria remained one of the most powerful states of Britain and Ireland well into the Viking Age. Ecgfrith was buried on Iona and succeeded by his illegitimate half-brother, Aldfrith.

==Northumbrian Monasticism==
Like his father before him, Ecgfrith supported the religious work of Benedict Biscop in the kingdom and gave him 70 hides of land near the mouth of the River Wear in 674 to undertake the building of a monastery dedicated to St. Peter. About ten years later, he made a second gift of land, 40 hides on the River Tyne at Jarrow, for the establishment of a sister house dedicated to St. Paul. These two houses came to be known as the Monastery of Wearmouth and Jarrow, an establishment made famous by the scholar Bede, who, at the age of seven, was put into the care of Benedict Biscop at Wearmouth and remained for the rest of his life as a monk. His &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; was completed there in 731.

==Coinage==
Ecgfrith appears to have been the earliest Northumbrian king, and perhaps the earliest of the Anglo-Saxon rulers, to have issued the silver penny, which became the mainstay of English coinage for centuries afterwards. Coins had been produced by the Anglo-Saxons since the late 6th century, modelled on the coins being produced by the Merovingians in Francia, but these were rare, the most common being gold &quot;&quot; (shillings) or &quot;thrymsas&quot;. Ecgfrith&#x27;s pennies, also known as &quot;sceattas&quot;, were thick and cast in moulds, and were issued on a large scale.

<text>Matthew Cook (born February 7, 1970) is a mathematician and computer scientist who is best known for having proved Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s conjecture that the Rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing-complete.

==Biography==
Cook was born in Morgantown, West Virginia and grew up in Evanston, Illinois. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Illinois and the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. In 1987, Cook qualified as a member of the six-person US team to the International Mathematical Olympiad and won a bronze medal. In 1990, Cook went to work for Wolfram Research, makers of the computer algebra system Mathematica. He did his doctoral work in Computation and Neural Systems at Caltech from 1999 to 2005. He is now at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at Zurich in Switzerland.

==Work with Stephen Wolfram==
In the 1990s Cook worked as a research assistant to Stephen Wolfram, assisting with work on Wolfram&#x27;s book, &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;. Among other things, he developed a proof showing that the Rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing-complete.

Cook presented his proof at the Santa Fe Institute conference CA98 before the publishing of Wolfram&#x27;s book—an action that led Wolfram Research to accuse Cook of violating his NDA and resulted in the blocking of the publication of the proof in the conference proceedings.
&quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; was released in 2002 with an outline of the proof. In 2004, Cook published his proof in Wolfram&#x27;s journal &quot;Complex Systems&quot;.

<text>General Sir William Fenwick Williams, 1st Baronet of Kars (4 December 180026 July 1883) was a Nova Scotian military leader for the British during the Victorian era.

Williams is remembered for his defence of the town of Kars during the Crimean War. He with other British officers inspired the poorly equipped Turkish soldiers to repel Russian attacks by General Murav’ev on the besieged town for three months, causing 6,000 Russian casualties. They were forced to surrender due to starvation, disease and shortage of ammunition. However, they surrendered on their own terms, with the officers being allowed to retain their swords. Williams was imprisoned at Ryazan, but he was treated very well and released at the end of the Crimean War in 1856. Before returning home he was introduced to Tsar Alexander II.

Many other honours were bestowed upon Williams, and in 1865–1867, he was appointed the first Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, where he was born.

==Early life==

He was born in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, the second son of Commissary-General Thomas Williams, barrack-master at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He was, however, widely rumoured to be the illegitimate son of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn; this would make him Queen Victoria&#x27;s half-brother. Williams never denied this, but it is not thought to be true.

==Career==

Williams was educated at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. He entered the Royal Artillery as second lieutenant in 1825. His services were lent to Turkey in 1841, and he was employed as a captain in the arsenal at Constantinople. He was British commissioner in the conferences preceding the treaty of Erzurum in 1847, and again in the settlement of the Ottoman-Iranian boundary in 1848. He was appointed CB in 1852.

=== Crimean War ===

Promoted colonel, he was British commissioner with the Turkish army in Anatolia in the Crimean War (Russian War) of 1854–56, and, having been made a pasha (general/governor/lord) with the degree of &quot;ferik&quot; (major-general), he commanded the Turkish troops at the defence of the town of Kars during the Crimean War. He with other British officers inspired the poorly equipped Turkish soldiers to repel Russian attacks by General Muravyov on the besieged town for three months causing 6,000 Russian casualties. They were forced to surrender due to starvation, disease and shortage of ammunition. However, they surrendered on their own terms, with the officers being allowed to retain their swords. Williams was imprisoned at Ryazan but he was treated very well and released at the end of the Crimean War in 1856. Before returning home he was introduced to Tsar Alexander II.

Williams had put up such an honourable defence of the city that Muravyov stated: &quot;General Williams, you have made yourself a name in history, and posterity will stand amazed at the endurance, courage and the discipline which the siege has called forth in the remains of the army.&quot;

A baronetcy with pension for life, the KCB, the grand cross of the Legion of Honour and of the Order of the Medjidie, the freedom of the City of London with a sword of honour, and the honorary degree of DCL of Oxford University, were the distinctions conferred upon him.
Promoted major-general in November 1855 on his return from captivity in Russia, he held the Woolwich command, and represented the borough of Calne in parliament from 1856 to 1859. In the lead up to the American Civil War, from 1859 to 1864, he held the position of Commander-in-Chief, North America, and was responsible for preparations for war with the United States in the case that relations broke down. The most severe strain in relations occurring during the Trent Affair. He was promoted to lieutenant-general and appointed colonel-commandant Royal Artillery in 1864.

== Governorships ==

He held the governorship of Nova Scotia from 1865 to 1867. After Canadian Confederation in 1867, Williams continued in office as the first Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and the governorship of Gibraltar from September 1870 to 1876. He was advanced to GCB in 1871 and Constable of the Tower of London in 1881.

==Later life==

He died in a hotel in Pall Mall on 26 July 1883 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. The portrait by William Gush was painted for the Parliament House, Halifax, Nova Scotia and hangs to this day in Province House, Halifax.

<doc id="145315" wikidata="Q272212" url="?curid=145315" title="Æthelred of Mercia">
<text>Æthelred (; died after 704) was king of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died from an illness. Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the Kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia&#x27;s possession. However, Æthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors&#x27; domination of southern Britain.

He was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church&#x27;s diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria. Æthelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; Æthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria.

Æthelred&#x27;s wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 Æthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere&#x27;s son Coenred. Æthelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there. Ceolred, who was Æthelred&#x27;s son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that Æthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

==Mercia in the seventh century==
By the 7th century, England was almost entirely divided into kingdoms ruled by the Anglo-Saxons who had come to Britain two hundred years before. The kingdom of Mercia occupied what is now the English midlands. The origin of the kingdom is not recorded, but royal genealogies preserved in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the Anglian collection agree that the royal houses were descended from a founder named Icel; the Mercian royal house is hence known as the Iclingas. The earliest Mercian king about whom definite historical information has survived is Penda of Mercia, Æthelred&#x27;s father. The larger neighbouring kingdoms included Northumbria to the north, recently united from its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira, East Anglia to the east, and Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south.

According to &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, a history of the English church written by the 8th-century monk Bede, there were seven early Anglo-Saxon rulers who held &quot;imperium&quot;, or overlordship, over the other kingdoms. The fifth of these was Edwin of Northumbria, who was killed at the battle of Hatfield Chase by a combined force including Cadwallon, a British king of Gwynedd, and Penda. After Edwin&#x27;s death, Northumbria briefly fell apart into its two subkingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Within a year Oswald, Edwin&#x27;s nephew, killed Cadwallon and reunited the kingdoms, subsequently re-establishing Northumbrian hegemony over the south of England. In 642 Penda killed Oswald at the battle of Maserfield, and Northumbria was again divided. Oswald&#x27;s son Oswiu succeeded to the throne of Bernicia, and Osric&#x27;s son Oswine to Deira, the southern of the two kingdoms.

In 655, Oswiu defeated and killed Penda at the Battle of the Winwaed. Oswiu installed Peada, a son of Penda, as king of southern Mercia and ruled the northern half himself; after Peada was murdered in 656 Oswiu took direct control of all of Mercia. A coup in 658 threw off Northumbrian overlordship and established Wulfhere as king. By the early 670s, Wulfhere had become the most powerful king in southern Britain, with an effective hegemony over all the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except for Northumbria.

The main source for this period is Bede&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work also provides valuable information about the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. For Wessex and Kent, Bede had informants who supplied him with details of the church&#x27;s history in each province, but he appears to have had no such contact in Mercia, about which he is less well-informed. A further source for this period is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, compiled at the end of the 9th century in Wessex. The &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods.

==Ancestry and early reign==
Æthelred was the son of Penda of Mercia. Penda&#x27;s queen, Cynewise, is named by Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and so it is likely but not certain that she was Æthelred&#x27;s mother. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; gives Penda&#x27;s age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty years old at the time of his death, which is generally thought unlikely as two of his sons (Wulfhere and Æthelred) were young when he was killed. At least as likely is that Penda was fifty years old at his death, rather than at his accession. Æthelred&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes Wulfhere as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he and Æthelred were in their middle teens at that time. The early sources do not say whether Æthelred was older or younger than Wulfhere.

Nothing is known of Æthelred&#x27;s childhood. He had another brother, Peada, and two sisters, Cyneburh and Cyneswith; it is also possible that Merewalh, king of the Magonsæte, was Æthelred&#x27;s brother.

In 674, according to Stephen of Ripon, Wulfhere &quot;stirred up all the southern nations against [Northumbria]&quot;, but he was defeated by Oswiu&#x27;s son Ecgfrith who forced him to surrender Lindsey, and to pay tribute. Wulfhere survived the defeat, but died in 675, possibly of disease, and Æthelred became king.

The first recorded act of Æthelred&#x27;s reign is in 676, when his armies ravaged Kent, destroying Rochester, the seat of the bishops of West Kent. The reason for his attack is not recorded, but he may have wished to prevent King Hlothhere of Kent from regaining control of Surrey, which had been recently brought into the Mercian orbit by Wulfhere. It may also be that Æthelred sought revenge for the murder of the sons of Eormenred of Kent; the murders had been instigated by Ecgberht of Kent, Hlothhere&#x27;s brother, and it is possible that Æthelred was the uncle of the murdered princes. A third suggestion is that the kings of Essex solicited the invasion, in response to recent Kentish attempts to gain dominance over the East Saxons. Regardless of the reason, Hlothhere was likely then forced to accept Æthelred&#x27;s overlordship. The damage to the see of Rochester was so great that the incumbent bishop, Putta, retired from his diocese; his appointed successor, Cwichhelm, also gave up the see &quot;because of its poverty&quot;.

Early in Æthelred&#x27;s reign, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, began a substantial reorganization of the church in Mercia. In 675 he removed Winfred from his position as Bishop of Lichfield, and over the next four years he divided the vast Mercian see into the five dioceses of Leicester, Lichfield, Worcester, Dorchester and Hereford. Æthelred was a devout king, &quot;more famed for his pious disposition than his skill in war&quot;, and he made several gifts of land to the expanding church, including grants at Tetbury, Long Newnton, and Somerford Keynes. There is also a tradition that Æthelred was associated with the founding of Abingdon Abbey, in southern Oxfordshire.

==Relations with Northumbria==
Mercia had been in conflict with Northumbria since at least 633, when Penda of Mercia defeated and killed Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. However, there were diplomatic marriages between the two kingdoms: Æthelred&#x27;s sister Cyneburh married Alhfrith, a son of Oswiu of Northumbria, and both Æthelred and his brother Peada married daughters of Oswiu. Cyneburh&#x27;s marriage to Alhfrith took place in the early 650s, and Peada&#x27;s marriage, to Ealhflæd, followed shortly afterwards; Æthelred&#x27;s marriage, to Osthryth, is of unknown date but must have occurred before 679, since Bede mentions it in describing the Battle of the Trent, which took place that year.

Bede does not mention the cause of the battle, simply saying that it occurred in the ninth year of Ecgfrith&#x27;s reign. He is more informative on the outcome. Ælfwine, the young subking of Deira, was killed; Ælfwine was brother to Osthryth and Ecgfrith, and was well liked in both Mercia and Northumbria since Æthelred&#x27;s marriage to Osthryth. According to Bede, his death threatened to cause further strife between the two kingdoms, but Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, intervened:Theodore, the beloved of God, enlisting God&#x27;s help, smothered the flames of this awful peril by his wholesome advice. As a result, peace was restored between the kings and peoples, and in lieu of further bloodshed the customary compensation was paid to King Ecgfrith for his brother&#x27;s death.

Æthelred took possession of Lindsey again after the battle; the change in control this time was lasting, and Lindsey remained part of Mercia until the Viking invasion of the 9th century remade the map of England. Conflict between Northumbria and Mercia did not completely cease after this date: Scottish annals record that Æthelbald, an 8th-century Mercian king, ravaged Northumbrian territory in 740 while King Eadberht of Northumbria was absent fighting the Picts. However, the Battle of the Trent effectively ended Northumbrian involvement in southern Britain.

A conflict between Bishop Wilfrid of York and the church and secular establishment led to Wilfrid&#x27;s expulsion from Northumbria and the division of his vast diocese, and Æthelred sided with Ecgfrith against Wilfrid. After Ecgfrith&#x27;s death in 685, Archbishop Theodore arranged a reconciliation between Wilfrid and Aldfrith, Ecgfrith&#x27;s successor, but in 692 Aldfrith and Wilfrid fell out and Wilfrid went into exile in Mercia. Æthelred now supported Wilfrid, making him bishop of the Middle Angles, and defending him at the Council of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case before an assembly of bishops led by Archbishop Berhtwald of Canterbury. Æthelred&#x27;s support for Wilfrid embroiled him in dispute with both Canterbury and Northumbria, and it is not clear what his motive was, though it may be relevant that some of Wilfrid&#x27;s monasteries were in Mercian territory.

==The southern kingdoms==
Two charters of 681 show Æthelred granting land near Tetbury, on what is now the border between Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. This may indicate that Æthelred was able to extend Mercian influence further into the territory of the West Saxons, as Wulfhere had done before him. The West Saxons managed a significant military resurgence under Cædwalla, king of Wessex from about 685 to 688, but when Cædwalla departed for Rome on pilgrimage there may have been internal strife before Ine, his successor, took the throne. Cædwalla had successfully conquered the kingdoms of Sussex and Kent, and his abdication may have contributed to the unsettled history of the southeast over the next few years. In Kent, Oswine emerged as king, though only in eastern Kent; the western half of the kingdom was ruled by Swæfheard, son of Sæbbi, the king of Essex. It is possible that Æthelred provided support to both Swæfheard and Oswine; for each king a charter survives in which Æthelred confirms land grants they made in Kent, and Æthelred&#x27;s invasion of Kent in 676 indicates his opposition to the traditional Kentish royal house. A charter of Swæfheard&#x27;s dated 691 is also of interest as it indicates that Æthelred had invaded Kent; it has been suggested that Æthelred intended to place Wilfrid in the Archbishop&#x27;s seat at Canterbury, but if so he was unsuccessful. Alternatively, Æthelred may have needed assistance in Kent from the East Saxons who may have been independent of Mercia for a decade or more by that time. The East Saxons did return to the Mercian orbit over the next few years: a charter of Æthelred&#x27;s, dated between 693 and 704, shows him granting land to Wealdhere, the bishop of London, and in 704 Æthelred consented to a grant made by Swæfheard. The latter charter also appears to show that a &quot;comes&quot;, or local official, was put in place by the Mercians to protect their interests.

Despite this evidence of Mercian involvement in the southeast there is very little indication that Æthelred had expansionist ambitions to the south. The increasing strength of the West Saxons under Cædwalla and Ine would have limited Mercian opportunities in that direction. The Northumbrians were no longer a distraction; they had been contained north of the Humber since the Battle of the Trent, and became even less of a threat after their disastrous defeat in 685 at the hands of the Picts. A possible explanation is that Æthelred was preoccupied with war with the Welsh. It was also at this time that the Hwicce came more definitely into the Mercian orbit. The last Hwiccean ruler to take the title of king was Oshere, who died in 685; but from the mid-670s he sought Æthelred&#x27;s consent for his grants, and Æthelred regarded him as a subking. Further evidence of Æthelred&#x27;s involvement among the Hwicce comes from a charter in which he grants land for a minster in Gloucestershire, in Hwiccean territory; the charter is generally thought to be a fabrication, but it appears to be based on an authentic earlier source.

==Abdication and final years==
Osthryth was murdered in 697, for reasons unknown; according to Bede the murderers were &quot;her own people, the Mercian chieftains&quot;. Bede records that Peada&#x27;s death, forty years earlier, stemmed from &quot;the treachery, it is said, of his own wife&quot;; Peada&#x27;s wife was Ealhflæd, Osthryth&#x27;s sister. Hence Osthryth&#x27;s murder may have been in revenge for Peada&#x27;s assassination, though it has also been interpreted more directly as a sign of continuing hostility between Northumbria and Mercia. Osthryth was buried at Bardney in Lindsey, the monastery where, at her urging, the relics of her uncle, Oswald of Northumbria, were kept and revered, though evidence of resistance at Bardney to the cult of Oswald is also indicative of the poor relations between the two kingdoms.

In 704, Æthelred abdicated to become a monk and abbot at Bardney, leaving the kingship to his nephew Coenred. Seventh century Mercian rulers often patronised religious establishments outside the Mercian heartlands, perhaps as a way of gaining support in outlying provinces. Æthelred&#x27;s and Osthryth&#x27;s interest in Bardney is consistent with this pattern. The encouragement of the cult of royal saints in areas beyond the central Mercian lands also seems to have been a deliberate policy, and both Æthelred and Osthryth were later revered as saints at Bardney. It appears that Æthelred continued to have influence in the kingdom after his abdication: a passage in Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; shows Æthelred summoning Coenred to him and advising him to make peace with Wilfrid. The date of Æthelred&#x27;s death is not recorded; though it is known that he was buried at Bardney.

Æthelred had at least one son, Ceolred. According to the thirteenth-century &quot;Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham&quot;, Ceolred was not the son of Osthryth, although it does not name Ceolred&#x27;s mother, and in the view of the historian Ann Williams this may mean that Æthelred remarried after Osthryth&#x27;s death. However, Susan Kelly states that Osthryth was &quot;most likely (though not certainly)&quot; Ceolred&#x27;s mother. Ceolred succeeded to the throne in 709, after Coenred abdicated in 709 to go to Rome on pilgrimage. One version of the regnal lists for Mercia shows a king named Ceolwald reigning after Ceolred, and it is possible that Ceolwald, if he existed, was also a son of Æthelred&#x27;s.

<text>Douglas, occasionally spelt [[Douglas (surname)|Douglass]]&quot;,&quot; is a Scottish surname. It is thought to derive from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;dubh glas&quot;, meaning &quot;black stream&quot;. There are numerous places in Scotland from which the surname is derived. The surname has developed into the given name Douglas. Douglas is a habitational name, which could be derived from any of the many places so-named. While there are numerous places with this name in Scotland, it is thought, in most cases, to refer to Douglas, South Lanarkshire, the location of Douglas Castle, the chief stronghold of the Lords of Douglas. The Scottish Gaelic form of the given name is ; the Irish-language forms are and &quot;Dubhghlas&quot;, which are pronounced . According to George Fraser Black, in southern Argyllshire the surname is an Anglicised form of the surnames &quot;MacLucas&quot;, &quot;MacLugash&quot; (which are derived from the Gaelic &quot;Mac Lùcais&quot;).
