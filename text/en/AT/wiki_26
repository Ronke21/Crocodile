<text>McKinley is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was around 418 at the 2000 census. The census-designated place of Jump River is located partially in the town.

==History==
Some of the earliest European Americans to walk the six mile square that would become McKinley were the U.S. government&#x27;s surveyors. In 1847 they surveyed the outline of the township on foot with chain and compass. Then others came back in 1855 to survey all the section lines. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains several Swamps and some of considerable extent. They are all unfit for cultivation. The Meadow and Alder Bottoms are all subject to be overflowed to a depth of 1 too 2 feet And are good for Hay. The Surface is level apart is upland where the Soil is 2d rate. This Township is heavily timbered and is chiefly composed of Hemlock, Yellow Birch, Balsam and White Pine. The undergrowth is generally thick and is composed of Hemlock Balsam and Hazel. Balsam and Elm line the Margins of Meadow and Alder Bottoms. The River Enters the Township near the SE corner of Section 12 and flows a West SouthWesterly course, with a Rapid current and is from 2 too 4 feet deep, and is adapted to the forming of a good motive power for mills. There is no improvements in this Township.&quot;

The federal government granted the first land patents in McKinley in 1860, giving four 160-acre parcels along the Jump River in sections 30 and 29 (around the modern Geise/Winger neighborhood) to Belinda Bonesteel and Harrison Hobart. These grants were payment to descendants of Ah-Pashe-Aien, Ke-Woi-Tch-Ke-Tas-Shew, Ky-Sha-Shek and Ky-Ny-Wack-Um, who had served in the Black Hawk War in Captain Augustin Grignon&#x27;s Menominee Volunteers thirty years before. Apparently they had sold their long-awaited payment for their military service to Bonesteel and Hobart. The largest grantee was Ezra Cornell, who received many half-sections in McKinley in 1868 and 1869 to help finance the new Cornell University under the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act.

A map of the square that would become McKinley shows no roads and no settlers. At that time only a few forties were still owned by the government. Most were in private hands, with the largest landowners being Cornell University, Chippewa Lumber and Boom, J. Paul and M.W. Simmonds. 

In 1902 a town of McKinley was carved out of the larger town of Westboro, which had previously spanned the width of Taylor County. This McKinley included the present-day towns of McKinley and Jump River until 1923. Then the town of Jump River was split off, leaving McKinley with its present boundaries.

Around 1904 McKinley gained a new connection to the outside world when the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railroad built its track arcing across the east side of the township and down along the river bottom to Jump River. With that means of transport in place, the Northwestern Lumber Company began logging in the area, with temporary railroad spurs reaching to logging camps scattered around the township. Spur 5 followed the course of modern Spur Road/Spur 5 east of Sunnyside Road, then continued to the Jump River. West of Sunnyside Spur 5 generally ran south of modern Spur Road, with temporary branches to different logging camps, and eventually connected with the Owen and Northern Railroad south of Sheldon. Spur 4 branched out through the part of the township north of the river. A timetable from 1906 indicates that the train from Stanley steamed through the township around 10:30am every day except Sunday, then chugged up from the river and headed back south around noon.

Starting in 1906 a developer T.H. Field tried to create a village of Field in McKinley, kitty-corner across the river and the railroad from the new community of Jump River. He had the town platted and managed to establish a post office named Field and perhaps some sort of hotel, some homes, and a sawmill. But he couldn&#x27;t get the SM&amp;P to stop on his side of the river, and his dream eventually grew up in weeds.

The 1911 plat map shows the SM&amp;P again, but now with a further rail segment north of the river heading toward Walrath. That 1911 map shows only a few roads. A few settlers had homes along the river and along what would become the east end of Buckhorn Road. The rest of the township was owned by lumber companies, with the Northwestern Lumber Company owning over half the land. This is in contrast to down by Gilman, which the same plat book shows was filling in, and over by Medford where the Wisconsin Central had been operating for almost forty years, where some townships were nearly completely settled by this time. McKinley was late to settle.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.8 square miles (92.8 km2), of which, 35.8 square miles (92.6 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) of it (0.20%) is water.

The Jump River, Alder Creek, and Shoulder Creek flow through the township, all generally heading to the west-southwest. The part of the township north of the river is dominated by low ridges running parallel to the river. They could be drumlins left by a glacial advance, or they could mask shapes of the rock beneath the glacial till. South of the river the land is mostly gently rolling glacial till, interrupted by patches of hills, with heavier soil in the low spots.

Several man-made flowages are in a part of the Pershing Wildlife Area on the southern edge of the town. 

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 418 people, 139 households, and 104 families residing in the town. The population density was 11.7 people per square mile (4.5/km2). There were 186 housing units at an average density of 5.2 per square mile (2.0/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.76% white, and 0.24% from two or more races.

There were 139 households, out of which 37.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.9% were married couples living together, 7.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.5% were non-families. 19.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.01 and the average family size was 3.50.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 34.4% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 18.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $36,528, and the median income for a family was $43,906. Males had a median income of $22,303 versus $23,333 for females. The per capita income for the town was $16,276. About 6.7% of families and 13.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.6% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Molitor is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 324 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.0 square miles (93.1 km2), of which, 35.3 square miles (91.4 km2) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.7 km2) of it (1.86%) is water.

Most of Molitor is hilly, with small glacial lakes. It lies within the Perkinstown terminal moraine, which is described under Taylor County. Among the hills are some flat areas with rims which were the bottoms of ice-walled lakes after the last glacier receded.

Three of Taylor County&#x27;s twelve state natural areas lie in this town: Lost Lake Esker SNA, Twin Lakes Bog SNA, and Mondeaux Hardwoods SNA.

==History==
The east side of the six mile (10 km) square that would become Molitor, which lies on the Fourth Principal Meridian, was first surveyed in May 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in the winter of 1857 and 1858 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and over frozen swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains numerous Tamarac and Cedar swamps but very few of much extent and Generally unfit for cultivation. The Surface is Broken and mostly 2nd rate soil and not very good for cultivation. Timber is very heavy all over the Township. Chiefly Hemlock Birch Pine and Tamarac. Tamarac and Spruce Trees principally line the Streams. There are several lake in this Township but not of much extent. There are numerous small streams running in a Northerly(?) direction (?) of which are generally Swampy among those are the East Branch of Yellow River raises in the South Easter portion of the Township and runs in a Northwesterly direction through the Township it flows(?) in a gentle current Deep and narrow not well adapted for good motive power or mills.&quot;

An 1880 map of central Wisconsin shows nothing of note in what would become Molitor except a patch of cranberries near the north fork of the Yellow River. The Town of Molitor was organized in 1886.

By 1900, a road of some sort ran across much of the south end of the town, following the course of modern Keyes Avenue. Sideroads reached to the north and south, but no more than a mile. Along those roads, the maps show about fifteen settlers&#x27; homesteads. The map shows a sawmill on Kleutsch land where modern Kleutsch Drive is. A school and church are at the junction of Keyes and Division Drive, and other schools were near Sackett Lake and the intersection of Keyes and Lake 19 Road. Four parcels in the southeast quarter were owned by Molitors. The northern half was unsettled yet, with Chippewa Lumber and Boom owning the largest portion, followed by the Wisconsin Central Railroad. The map showed a logging dam on the Yellow River in Section 10 on land owned by the Shaw Tannery.

The 1911 plat map shows not a lot of change. The roads had extended another mile and a few more settlers had taken up residence in the south. The Molitor name was replaced by other owners. A road clearly followed the course of modern County M. In the north, the Northwestern Lumber Co. had bought Chippewa Lumber and Boom&#x27;s land, and there were still no roads and few settlers.

In 1933, much of Molitor was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 263 people, 100 households, and 80 families residing in the town. The population density was 7.5 people per square mile (2.9/km2). There were 142 housing units at an average density of 4.0 per square mile (1.6/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.48% White, 0.38% Native American, 0.76% from other races, and 0.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.76% of the population.

There were 100 households, out of which 31.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.0% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.0% were non-families. 17.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 25.1% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 27.8% from 25 to 44, 28.5% from 45 to 64, and 11.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 113.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $37,500, and the median income for a family was $43,750. Males had a median income of $28,750 versus $20,568 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,804. About 13.1% of families and 13.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.7% of those under the age of eighteen and none of those 65 or over.

<doc id="139829" wikidata="Q1886442" url="?curid=139829" title="Pershing, Wisconsin">
<text>Pershing is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 180 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Donald is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.8 square miles (92.8 km2), of which 35.7 square miles (92.4 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.4 km2) (0.45%) is water.

The water consists mostly of man-made flowages in the Pershing Wildlife Area, and the Fisher River, which crosses Pershing from east to west.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Pershing was first surveyed in 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government, then again in 1852. Then in 1855 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and slogging through the swamps on foot, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
 &quot;This Township contains several swamps and one in the SE corner of considerable extent. They are all unfit for cultivation. The meadow and Alder bottoms are all subject to be overflowed to a depth of 1 to 2 feet and are good for Hay. The surface is generally low and level a part is upland where the soil is 2d rate. This township is heavily timbered and is chiefly composed of Hemlock and Y. Birch on low level land and on uplands Sugar, Linden W. Pine and Balsam. The undergrowth is Generally thick and is composed of Hemlock Balsam and Hazel. Balsam and Elm line the margins of the Meadow and Alder bottoms. There is no improvements on this Township.&quot;

Pershing was logged starting in the late 1800s. Around 1903 the Eau Claire, Chippewa Falls, and Northeastern Railway (a.k.a. the Omaha) built its line across the township, running just south of modern County M. Around 1905 the Wisconsin Central Railway built the line which would become the Soo Line and on which trains run to this day. At the junction of the two lines the community of Donald rose.

The 1911 plat map of the six mile square that would become Pershing shows the two railroads in place. Some sort of road parallels the Omaha, following the course of modern County M. Another road follows the course of modern Gilman Drive, heading south from M toward Gilman. Outside of Donald, all the land in the township appears to be owned by logging companies. There is not a single settler&#x27;s home, though the same set of maps in 1911 has a fair number of settlers in what would become Aurora and a smattering around both Hannibal and Jump River. Among the lumber companies, the largest landholders are the Northwestern Lumber Co., J.S. Owen, Fountain-Campbell Lumber Co., Mississippi River Lumber Co., A. Brown, and H. Lindemann.

By the 1913 plat map, a new road had appeared, following the course of modern County H to the north of M. Most of the land is still owned by lumber companies, but a few settlers&#x27; homes exist, mostly along the road that would become M, but also two along what would become H. These were the start of the shift from logging to farming.

That transition accelerated as more land was cut off and the choice trees ran out. The Omaha railroad shut down in 1939. In early August 1936 more than two thirds of Pershing was burned by wildfires, forcing fifteen families to flee their homes.

The Pershing Wildlife Area began in 1953 as a public hunting ground when Taylor County leased some less-desirable land in the towns of Pershing, Cleveland and McKinley to the state. In 1960 the county donated 3,400 acres and it has been managed by the DNR since. It now totals 7,900 acres - much of it wetlands enhanced with manmade flowages and small ponds dug into marshy areas - managed mainly for waterfowl and sharp-tailed grouse.

As of 2023, Donald is practically a ghost town with only a few houses remaining. Canadian National trains rumble by, but never stop. Much of Pershing is farmed by families: dairy, beef and crops.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 180 people, 70 households, and 45 families residing in the town. The population density was 5.0 people per square mile (1.9/km2). There were 92 housing units at an average density of 2.6 per square mile (1.0/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.56% of the population.

There were 70 households, out of which 28.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.0% were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.3% were non-families. 28.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.22.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.8% under the age of 18, 8.3% from 18 to 24, 22.8% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 20.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 120.3 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $27,083, and the median income for a family was $60,833. Males had a median income of $33,750 versus $35,417 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,607. About 8.8% of families and 14.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.6% of those under the age of eighteen and 22.2% of those sixty-five or over.

<text>Roosevelt is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 444 at the 2000 census. The village of Lublin lies within the town of Roosevelt. The unincorporated community of Bellinger is also located partially in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 34.5 square miles (89.4 km2), of which, 34.4 square miles (89.1 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.38%) is water.

On the east edge of Roosevelt is Diamond Lake, a Wisconsin State Natural Area, which is managed as an ecological reference area.

==History==
In July 1847 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed the boundaries of the six mile square which would become Roosevelt. Then in June 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Surface of This Township is generally Broken Soil(?) poor 3rd Rate. Timber is principally Hemlock. There is Some little White Pine Scattered through the Township but of poor quality. The Township is well watered with numerous Small Streams. There are no Settlers in the Township.&quot;

Around 1900 most of what would become Roosevelt was owned by lumber companies, with the Northwestern Lumber Company owning the most, especially in the south half, and Chippewa Lumber and Boom Co. owning some large blocks in the north. A map shows a logging dam on the Eau Claire River in section 31. No homesteads appeared on the map at this time. Big changes were coming soon.
Around 1905 the J.S. Owen Company built a rail line for the Wisconsin Central Railway heading northwest across the town for Ladysmith and Superior. That same year the Taylor County Board created the Town of Roosevelt, splitting it off from the initial Town of Little Black, which had spanned the width of Taylor County.

The 1911 plat map of Roosevelt shows the Wisconsin Central/Soo Line cutting across the township from southeast to northwest, passing through Lublin. From Lublin, The Owen Lumber Company has a logging spur branching off to Diamond Lake and beyond. A road of some sort heads west from Lublin, following the course of modern County F. More roads cover the southwest corner of the town, which is pretty well settled, with many of the names Polish. The map shows two schools in this area and one back in Lublin. There is also a well-settled block northeast of Lublin. This settlement around Lublin and its continuation into what is now Taft were by far the largest collection of farmer-settlers in western Taylor County at this time - much more than around Gilman. Other than those settled areas, most of the town was in the hands of Chippewa Lumber and Boom Co., State Land Co., and the American Immigration Co. The transition from logging to farming was well underway.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 444 people, 149 households, and 116 families residing in the town. The population density was 12.9 people per square mile (5.0/km2). There were 169 housing units at an average density of 4.9 per square mile (1.9/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White.

There were 149 households, out of which 34.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.1% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.1% were non-families. 18.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.98 and the average family size was 3.42.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.7% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 22.5% from 25 to 44, 23.9% from 45 to 64, and 17.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 112.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.6 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $32,000, and the median income for a family was $37,750. Males had a median income of $26,786 versus $24,500 for females. The per capita income for the town was $15,476. About 10.4% of families and 9.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.5% of those under age 18 and 17.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Notable people==

* Joseph Sweda, Wisconsin State Representative, farmer, and businessman, lived in the town; Sweda served as chairman of the Roosevelt Town Board

<doc id="139832" wikidata="Q1888112" url="?curid=139832" title="Taft, Wisconsin">
<text>Taft is a town in the southwest corner of Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 361 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Bellinger is located partially in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.6 square miles (94.8 km2), of which, 36.5 square miles (94.5 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) (0.35%) is water.

Taft lies within the Perkinstown terminal moraine, a line of hills left when the Chippewa lobe of the last glacier stopped advancing and retreated, described further under Taylor County geography. An esker wanders through the northwest corner of Taft, and ice-walled lake plains are interspersed among the choppy hills. Peat soils have developed in some low spots.

==History==
In July 1847 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed the boundaries of the six mile square which would become Taft. This was repeated in late 1848. Then in June 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Surface of this Township is generally Broken Soil 3rd rate producing but little vegetation the Surface of the land being generally covered with a thick heavy moss(?). There are numerous Swamp in the Township Some of which are of considerable extent. The Timber in the Swamps is principally Tamarac. The dry land is timbered mostly with Hemlock. There are Some Scattering groves of White Pine though of poor quality and not valuable for lumber. The Township is well watered with numerous Small Streams which rise in the Swamps. There are no Settlers in the Township.&quot;

By 1900, most of what would become Taft was owned by lumber companies. The Northwestern Lumber Company owned a large block in the southeast corner and had built its Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway into that block three or four miles. The other largest landholders were Chippewa Lumber and Boom Co., and Lindsay &amp; Phelps. One settler is marked on the map for the whole section: Hobbs has a homestead near Otter Creek.

By 1911 the SM&amp;P had pushed all the way through the town and far beyond. Some sort of road followed the course of modern County F across the middle of the township, and the north-bound jog continued up what is now Skyline Drive. Another road followed the course of modern highway 73 south to the county line, and that southeast corner has a fairly complete road grid, though these roads must have been crude. In this corner the Northwestern Lumber Co. had succeeded in selling most of its logged land to settlers, most with Polish names. In 1911 there were far more settlers here and around Lublin than anywhere else in western Taylor County. The rest of Taft had a few settlers at this time, with most of the land still in lumber company hands - Chippewa Lumber and Boom holding the majority.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 361 people, 120 households, and 84 families residing in the town. The population density was 9.9 people per square mile (3.8/km2). There were 132 housing units at an average density of 3.6 per square mile (1.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.51% White, 0.55% Native American, 0.28% Asian, 1.11% from other races, and 0.55% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 1.39% of the population.

There were 120 households, out of which 40.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.2% were married couples living together, 2.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.2% were non-families. 20.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.01 and the average family size was 3.64.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 34.3% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 25.5% from 25 to 44, 17.2% from 45 to 64, and 15% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 119.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $37,500, and the median income for a family was $41,071. Males had a median income of $24,615 versus $21,429 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,447. About 5.6% of families and 8.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.4% of those under age 18 and 13.3% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Westboro is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 660 at the 2000 census. The census-designated place of Westboro is located in the town. The unincorporated community of Queenstown is also located in the town.

==Geography==

Westboro is the largest town in Taylor County. Instead of the typical six miles by six, it is six by twenty miles. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 125.4 square miles (324.9 km2), of which, 124.1 square miles (321.4 km2) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.5 km2) (1.07%) is water.

Westboro contains three of Taylor County&#x27;s twelve Wisconsin State Natural Areas: Kidrick Swamp SNA, Silver Creek &amp; Mondeaux River SNA, and part of Mondeaux Hardwoods SNA.

==History==

In 1847, surveyors working for the U.S. government walked the six mile squares that would become the town of Westboro. They marked off the outlines of those squares on foot using compass and chain. A crew came back in 1858 to survey all the section lines. When done, the deputy surveyor filed a general description for each six-mile square. Of them, the description of west-central Westboro (T33N R1W) is clearest: &quot;This Township contains a few Tamarac and Cedar Swamps of Small extent, most of them unfit for cultivation. The surface is a Rolling Soil first and Second rate. Timber chiefly Hemlock Birch, Maple, Pine, Tamarac and Cedar. There is a large Windfall runs across the North West corner bears in South West and North East Direction Timber Decayed and grown to second Growth Popler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is several creeks in this Township among which is the Yellow River runs in a North Westerly course across the South West corner of the Township. It is a deep and narrow Stream flows in a gentle current, not good for forming Motive Power for Mill. There is another Stream of considerable extent enters the Township near the South East corner and runs in a gentle current Northwesterly. It is a deep narrow Stream banks low and principally lined with Alder.&quot;

A different surveyor in 1862 was more enthusiastic about east-central Westboro, the six mile square where most of the population is today: &quot;A large portion of this Township is valuable for its splendid White Pine, also for its good soil. The surface is rolling and Timber heavy.&quot;

In the early 1870s the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company built its line up from Medford through the forest that would become Westboro. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for 18 miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd-numbered sections. The railroad established stations at Whittlesey, Chelsea, and what would become the village of Westboro. Settlers first arrived in 1874. When Taylor County was formed in 1875, the Town of Westboro was six miles north to south same as today, but it spanned the full width of the county, including all modern towns from McKinley to Rib Lake.

In 1878 John Duncan had a &quot;pole line&quot; tramway hauling logs north along Fisher Creek to the millpond in Westboro to feed to his sawmill. The pole line was a track of hardwood saplings spiked to hardwood ties, over which horses pulled carts loaded with wood.

By 1880 the town had a population of 230. The village had two sawmills, two stores, two hotels, three saloons, and a school. Outside the railroad and the village, an 1880 map shows some sort of road running east three miles from town to James Lake. Another road runs two miles west, running north of Silver Creek. Then this road joins with what is labelled &quot;Winter Road.&quot; This was a logging tote road which followed Silver Creek west through the forests, then crossed over to the Yellow River watershed and followed that river into Chippewa County. This trail was used to shuttle supplies to logging camps during the winter logging season. During this phase the loggers focused on cutting white pine - the most valuable tree - floating the logs down Silver Creek and the Yellow River in spring log drives.

In 1885 the town of Rib Lake was split off from the east end of Westboro.

A map from around 1900 shows a good number of homesteads along the railroad and along the two roads previously mentioned. A rail spur had been built from Chelsea toward Rib Lake across the south end of the town and across the end of Wellington Lake. That railroad track was paralleled by some sort of road following the course of modern highway 102, with settlers along it. Many settlers had established homesteads around Chelsea and a road zigzagged along the course of modern Chelsea Avenue west of Shearer Lake. A rural school was marked on that road. Another school was marked two miles to the north on what would become Rindt Road, near more homesteads. Another was where modern Gunnar Road meets Fischer Creek Road and another east of Westboro on what would become Lucia Road. West of Westboro was another rural school on a forerunner of Silver Creek Road. A little further west, that road turned south and crossed Silver Creek, turning west again to follow the course of modern County D almost ten miles beyond the Mondeaux River, then turning north, where a handful of homesteads cluster. Beyond that, no homesteads or roads are marked in the township until the Broederville settlement on the Jump River - then a part of Westboro. Major landholders were the Wisconsin Central Railroad throughout most of the area, J. Duncan near his sawmill in Westboro, N. Wisconsin Land Company, Ramsay Land Company, and along the Yellow River, Chippewa Lumber and Boom and W.J.Starr.

In 1902 the western twelve miles of Westboro was split off into a new Town of McKinley, which then included the modern town of Jump River.

The 1911 plat maps show more roads and more homesteads. On the east end around the railroad, a few roads had been extended and some lumber company land had been split up and sold to settlers. Not a lot had changed since 1900, but a new railroad wound west through the forests. This was the Westboro Logging Line, a logging railroad started in 1900 by the Heidrich and Matson Lumber Company, which had bought Duncan&#x27;s sawmill in Westboro and his timber holdings. In 1902 that company was in turn bought by Pennsylvania investors and renamed the Westboro Lumber Company. The Westboro Logging Line eventually reached twelve miles west of Westboro, across Mondeaux Creek to the north fork of the Yellow River. On the 1911 map a new rural school and a few more settlers had appeared on what is now Heldstab Road. Beyond that, a few families had settled out near where the Jump River fire lookout would later be built, with a new rural school nearby. Other than that, the west end was still owned by companies, with the Wisconsin Central Railway and the Yellow River Lumber Company holding the largest shares.

In 1933 much of the cut-over west half of the town of Westboro was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest. Starting that year, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Mondeaux developed the Mondeaux Dam Recreation Area.

<text>Blair is a city in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, along the Trempealeau River. The population was 1,325 at the 2020 census. Blair is on the former Green Bay and Western Railroad, which ran down the Trempealeau River valley to Winona, Minnesota.

==History==
The city was first settled during the 1850s. The majority of the city&#x27;s population are descended from Norwegian settlers, with a smaller group descended from German settlers. The city&#x27;s Norwegian heritage is represented by annual lefse and lutefisk suppers at the churches and a love of polka music. A lefse company is located in Blair.

The city&#x27;s name was changed from Porterville in 1873 when the Green Bay and Western Railroad was routed through the city. The new name of Blair came from one of the railroad&#x27;s chief investors, John Insley Blair. At one time, during the heyday of railroads, a branch line connected the GB&amp;W with the nearby village of Ettrick, although it was later abandoned. The railroad continues to operate, although under a different name.

The city has avoided the fate of some small towns in the Midwest which slowly lost population due to young people leaving for jobs elsewhere. The population of Blair nearly doubled in the years between 1950 and 2000. During the 1950s and earlier annual floods during the snow melt were often experienced, but better farming techniques now make flooding rare. More recently, a number of Amish farming families have settled in the area and their horse-drawn carriages are sometimes seen on the roads. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Two highways connect to the city: Highway 53, a north-south route, and Highway 95, an east-west route. The closest large cities are Eau Claire to the north and La Crosse to the south. Whitehall, the county seat, is seven miles away. The rural area surrounding Blair is in the Town of Preston. Nearby communities include Taylor, Arcadia, Independence, Hixton, and Galesville.

The Trempealeau River near Blair was dammed to create Lake Henry, named after one of the first settlers.

Blair is in the Driftless Area, which was undisturbed by the last great glacial flow over North America. The area is also known as the Coulee Region, characterized by rolling hills. The forested hills are favored by deer hunters. Pheasants and grouse are also hunted. Local streams are fished for trout, which are stocked.

<text>Eleva ( ) is a village within the Town of Albion in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, along the Buffalo River. The population was 670 at the 2010 Census and reached 685 in the 2020 Census.

==History==
Before white settlement, Lakota and Ho-Chunk Indians controlled the area that would become Eleva, but Ojibwe territory lay only ten miles north, across the Chippewa River. The first settlers in what would become the town of Albion arrived in 1856. Most settled east of the future Eleva, around what would be called Hamlin, on the stage road from Whitehall to Eau Claire. In these early days some Indians still migrated through in the spring and fall, camping just west of where Eleva would grow. William Moon, one of the first settlers, harvested potatoes that first fall of 1856 - the first harvest in Albion. In following years more settlers arrived, and began growing wheat and corn.

The first building in what would become Eleva was constructed in 1863, when Joseph and Elizabeth Cooper built a cabin of tamarack logs near Big Creek. They left when Joseph volunteered in the Union Army, but returned to their cabin after the war. David J. O&#x27;dell settled nearby in 1867.

In 1876 John Redford and Marsh Goddard arrived, starting a combination general store and blacksmith shop. Goddard hauled most of his goods by horse and wagon from the train station in Augusta. That same year, Philo Englesby built a hotel. The following year E.J. Carpenter started a grist mill on Big Creek which ground wheat between two big flat stones. That year the community added a second general store, a hardware store, a drug store, a confectionery, a meat shop, and a boarding house. Perhaps because the community was growing so fast, an 1877 map labelled it &quot;New Chicago.&quot;

The village was platted in 1877. The source of the name &quot;Eleva&quot; has long been debated, with these possible origins:

# Some say &quot;Eleva&quot; is how Indians pronounced &quot;I leave you&quot; when they left.
# Some say it was named after a place in Ireland.
# Some say that &quot;ELEVA&quot; was painted on a grain elevator, and then winter struck before the painter could finish &quot;TOR&quot;. Newcomers assumed the letters were the name of the village.
# Some say the town was named after a French village by Goddard, who was from France.
# Some say it was named for Goddard&#x27;s daughter Eva, who died young.

The community&#x27;s first school was built in 1885, but it was two miles east, called Grant School for the farmer who rented the school land. This Grant was also the chairman of the school district, and a second cousin of President Ulysses S. Grant. A post office called &quot;Eleva&quot; started operation in one of the town&#x27;s stores the same year. 

In 1889 Nathaniel Foster&#x27;s &quot;Fairchild and Mississippi Railroad&quot; reached Eleva, following the Buffalo (then Beef) River. Foster added a lumber yard in Eleva and the railroad built a depot in 1890. A few years later Foster&#x27;s railroad was acquired by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway.

In 1890 Henry Ruseling replaced his old stone grist mill with the modern-for-the-time Eleva Roller Mills, powered by water or coal, producing 50 barrels of wheat per day. That year, the town built its own school in town, serving grades one through eight. The town was booming, with two elevators, a cheese factory, a flour and feed mill, a hardware store, a drug store, a printer, a photographer, a tailor, a shoemaker, two plumbers, two blacksmiths, a doctor, an implement dealer, two hay buyers, and two livestock dealers. The town had no saloons. With all these services in Eleva and the railroad bypassing Hamlin two miles to the east, Hamlin gradually dried up.

In 1901 the Osseo Telephone Company opened an exchange in Eleva. In 1902 Eleva incorporated as a village, with population around 314. That same year, Eleva replaced its 1890 school with a new brick school that taught grades one through ten, making it a state-graded school. The following year the Bank of Eleva was organized.

In 1914 the village began to furnish electric service. At first the electricity was on only in the evenings, with extended hours on Tuesdays so the women could do their ironing.

In 1917, Eleva&#x27;s school became a high school, running through grade twelve. That served the community until 1950, when the shared Eleva-Strum high school was built midway between the two towns. Eleva itself built a new grade school in 1960.

<text>Independence is a city in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,498 at the 2020 census. It is located at the confluence of Elk Creek and the Trempealeau River.

==History==
Unless otherwise noted, the history below is taken from a local historical album published for the city&#x27;s centennial in 1976.

Independence is in the Town of Burnside, which corresponds with one of the townships created under the Land Ordinance of 1785. Shortly after the naming of Burnside in 1863, settlers from Europe and the Eastern United States began arriving in significant numbers.
The city of Independence owes its existence to a railroad and a man named David M. Kelly. Running almost parallel to the Trempealeau River is the Green Bay and Western Railroad, which is part of a line originally intended to run from Green Bay, Wisconsin to Wabasha, Minnesota. Kelly was an enthusiastic promoter of building a depot for the new line in Burnside.

After much disagreement and dispute over its location, Green Bay and Lake Pepin (as the company was then known) agreed to build a depot if $5,000 could be raised by the residents to finance construction. The money was raised, and Kelly bought the land for the depot in 1876. He founded a village on the land and named it Independence in honor of the nation&#x27;s centennial of independence. The village was incorporated in 1885 and became a city in 1942.

Independence has outlived the depot that was once at its heart. The line began at Green Bay but eventually reached Winona, Minnesota instead of Wabasha. Passenger service was never very profitable. Under the inexorable pressure of the automobile, passenger service ended in 1949, but freight trains still use the line today.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. It is within the Driftless Zone of the Midwest.

Just upstream from the intersection between Elk Creek and the Trempealeau is the dam impounding Bugle Lake. The present dam was built in 1935 as part of the Works Progress Administration. It replaced an earlier dam that had been built by a resident named W.S. Newton. It later broke and flooded all of Arcadia, Wisconsin in 2011. Bugle Lake has peaceful canoeing, and a small park covers the island in the lake.

==Beaver Controversy==
Recently a movement called &quot;Save Taryn&#x27;s Beaver&quot; was launched to save a family of beavers on upper Weister Creek. The beaver is a keystone species, increasing trout and bird biodiversity in its territory through creation of beaver ponds and wetlands. Options to manage the problem include beaver relocation, killing or installation of Flow devices to regulate pond height. The town of Clinton, Wisconsin is holding hearings to decide the fate of the Weister Creek beavers on May 12, 2010. At the first hearing, May 12, 70 citizens showed up and it was standing room only in a debate between those who wanted to protect the beavers versus those who feared further road damage or loss of pastureland to wetland. Bill Quackenbush, a representative of the Ho Chunk Tribal Nation, suggested that the Vernon County Board, which recently was awarded $1.2 million in funds from the Ho Chunk Nation to use on county projects, help defray the cost of installation of fencing and flow devices to lower the height of the beaver dam and protect Dell Road. The next hearing will be May 26.

At the start of the weekend, a small troll, standing several inches tall, is hidden somewhere within the city limits. A clue is posted downtown on each of the three days until someone finds the troll. The prize for retrieving the troll is $50.

<text>Eagle River is a city and the county seat of Vilas County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,628 at the 2020 census. Because of the many lakes in the area, the city is a popular vacation and retirement destination. The area contains many condominiums, seasonal vacation homes, and hunting cabins.

==History==
Eagle River was the site of the first permanent Native American settlement in the Wisconsin Northwoods, located on the shores of Watersmeet Lake where the Wisconsin River and Chain O&#x27; Lakes meet. These early Natives, who were called Old Copper Indians, were succeeded by the Woodland Indians from 2,600 B.C. to 800 A.D. These Natives were probably the ancestors of the Chippewa, Potawatomi, and Menominee.

The first recorded white settler in what became Vilas County was a man named Ashman who established a trading post in Lac du Flambeau in 1818. Eagle River&#x27;s name was derived from the abundance of eagles nesting along the river. It is believed that Bethuel Draper and &quot;Dutch Pete&quot; Cramer camped in the area in 1853 and were responsible for naming the community. A settlement grew as other families settled in the area in 1857. The town of Eagle River was created by an act of the state legislature in 1885. Vilas County was set off from Oneida County on April 12, 1893 and named for William Freeman Vilas, a migrant from Vermont. Vilas had served for Wisconsin in the United States Senate from 1891 to 1897. In the 1850s migrants from New England, primarily from Vermont and Connecticut, constructed a number of wagon roads and trails through Vilas County including the Ontonogan Mail Trail and a Military Road from Fort Howard to Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor, Michigan.

Eagle River is known as the &quot;Snowmobile Capital of the World&quot; because of the World Championship Snowmobile Derby held for over 50 years at an ice oval on the north side of the city. There are over 500 miles of groomed snowmobile trails in the county. The World Snowmobile Headquarters and International Snowmobile Hall of Fame are located in Eagle River.

The Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame is in Eagle River Stadium in Eagle River. The stadium is home to the Eagle River Falcons in the GLHL.

Eagle River has a public golf course, ERGC, located at 457 East McKinley Street near the airport.

Although Eagle River, WI is known for its sports and recreation, there wasn&#x27;t always a dedicated space for students and community members. During the New Deal Era, many men were unemployed and the need for a job was at an all-time high. With a population of 1,386, this W.P.A New Deal project employed 25 men who contributed to 9,940 hours of work in 4 months in 1937. Efforts made by the W.P.A not only provided much-needed space for local students but also helped keep the town’s vibrant sports culture, which continues to thrive today.

<text>Manitowish Waters is a town in Vilas County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 572 in the 2018 census. The unincorporated community Manitowish Waters, is also located within the town.

== History ==
In 1934, at the Little Bohemia Lodge on Little Star Lake, the FBI and Dillinger Gang were involved in a shootout, which resulted in the accidental shooting death of one local Civilian Conservation Corps worker and severely injuring two other workers by federal agents who mistook them for members of the gang. Agent W. Carter Baum was also shot and killed by Baby Face Nelson in a brief gunfight a short distance away, which resulted in another special agent and a local constable being wounded. All six members of the gang escaped the incident unharmed.

The lodge, then owned by Emil Wanatka, remains in existence as a restaurant today without lodging. Bullet holes in the building&#x27;s siding and windows from the shootout are still visible. Personal items left behind by the hasty departure of the Dillinger Gang members have been preserved and are on display. In the summer of 2008, the Little Bohemia Lodge was used in the filming of a re-creation of these events in the 2009 Michael Mann film &quot;Public Enemies&quot;, a movie about Dillinger and the FBI starring Johnny Depp as John Dillinger and Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis.

American businesspeople and political donors Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein are currently considered the &quot;main benefactors&quot; of Manitowish Rivers, owning a hotel, a condominium complex, a lakefront pavilion, a restaurant, a spa, a coffee shop, and two gift shops in the city, as well as numerous private residences. This is controversial among permanent residents of the town, as even though the Uihleins have invested more than 6.5 million dollars in the town between 2007 and 2015, the residents complain that they are &quot;left in the dark&quot; about Uihlein projects and that the Uihleins exert unfair influence over long-standing local businesses.

The area that is today Phelps was originally inhabited by the Chippewa Indian people. In the early 18th century, French trappers and fur traders settled in the area. Lac Vieux Desert served as a crossroads for this trade. Due to the abundance of healthy forest in the area, the logging business first arrived to exploit this resource in 1896. A large Finnish population moved to the town, significantly increasing its population, between 1906 and 1912.

In 1836, Colonel Samuel Phoenix spotted a rack of elk antlers in a tree and proclaimed the area as &quot;Elk Horn.&quot;

The area&#x27;s beauty and fertile soil led Daniel Bradley, his brother Milo, and LeGrand Rockwell to create a community in the area. Its growth to a population of 539 led to the first town meeting in 1846. Elkhorn was designated county seat that same year because of its location in Walworth County.

In 1851, Elkhorn became the location of the Walworth County Fair, which is now hosted annually at the Walworth County Fairgrounds. The Walworth County Fair is the largest county fair in Wisconsin.

In the 1870s, saline water from springs located in Elkhorn was believed to cure rheumatism.

Because the city places Christmas decorations around its center, Elkhorn has been called the &quot;Christmas Card Town&quot; since before World War II. This tradition is celebrated every year by an annual oil painting by local artist Jan Castle Reed. These watercolor paintings are turned into Christmas cards.

Elkhorn is also known for the folklore of the Beast of Bray Road, a supposed werewolf type creature that has become the focus of books, documentaries, and other media including 2005 movie, The Beast of Bray Road.

<text>Lake Geneva is a city in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Located in Walworth County and situated on Geneva Lake, it was home to 8,277 people as of the 2020 census, up from 7,651 at the 2010 census. It is located southwest of Milwaukee and northwest of Chicago.

Given its relative proximity to the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas, Lake Geneva has become a popular resort town that thrives on tourism. Since the late 19th century, it has been home to numerous lakefront mansions owned by wealthy Chicagoans as second homes, leading it to be nicknamed the &quot;Newport of the West.&quot;

==History==
Originally called &quot;Maunk-suck&quot; (&quot;Big Foot&quot;)&quot; after the man who led the local band of the Potawatomi in the first half of the 19th century, the city was later named Geneva after the town of Geneva, New York, which government surveyor John Brink thought it resembled. To avoid confusion with the nearby town of Geneva, Wisconsin, it was later renamed &quot;Lake Geneva&quot;&quot;.&quot;

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, a number of wealthy and prominent Chicago industrialists fled to the shores of Geneva Lake—then a popular summer camp destination—by train. Many of the families built palatial summer homes on the lake, which led it to be nicknamed the &quot;Newport of the West.&quot; Lake Geneva remains a popular summer tourism destination for boating, water sports, and viewing the mansions, which can be seen from the public Geneva Lake Shore Path. Two historic Lake Geneva mansions are open to the public: the Baker House, built in 1885, now a bed-and-breakfast; and Black Point, the lakefront summer estate built for beer baron Conrad Seipp in 1888 in the nearby town of Linn, now a Wisconsin Historical Society museum. Other famous residents who built or have owned mansions on Geneva Lake include the Wrigleys, the Schwinns, Otto Young, and Richard Driehaus.

In 1954, Lake Geneva was one of the three finalists for the location of the new United States Air Force Academy, but lost to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

In 1968, Hugh Hefner built his first Playboy resort in Lake Geneva. It closed in 1981 and was converted in 1982 to the Americana Resort, and in 1993 to the Grand Geneva Resort.

Royal Recorders (formerly Shade Tree Studios) was a Lake Geneva music recording studio where artists such as Ministry, Cheap Trick, Queensrÿche, Crash Test Dummies, Nine Inch Nails, and Skid Row recorded albums.

Lake Geneva was also home to TSR, Inc., the original publisher of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game, until its takeover by Wizards of the Coast in 1997.

<text>Williams Bay is a village in Walworth County, Wisconsin, United States. It is one of three municipalities on Geneva Lake. The population was 2,953 at the 2020 census. On June 22, 2024 the town was hit by an EF-1 tornado, there were no injuries or fatalities, but the storm caused some areas of considerable damage.

==History==
The village was named for Captain Israel Williams of Massachusetts, who, with several of his sons, settled in the area in 1837. Much of the surrounding area was settled in the early 19th century by surveyors plotting roadways from the East.

Williams Bay became a vacation spot for wealthy Chicagoans displaced by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The village continues to attract vacationers from Chicago, Milwaukee and elsewhere.

In 1873, mail jumping was established on Geneva Lake as a means to provide postal service via boat to lakeside homes. The tradition is ongoing. Each year between June 15 and September 15, jumpers deliver mail to piers along the lake on behalf of the US Postal Service.

In 1886, a training camp was established by leaders of the YMCA at Williams Bay. The camp&#x27;s programs later evolved into George Williams College, an independent institution of higher education based in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago and later in Downers Grove, Illinois. The Williams Bay site continued to be used as a summer training camp. The college was later absorbed by Aurora University.

The village is internationally recognized as the home of the Yerkes Observatory which was established by the University of Chicago in 1897. The building was designed by Henry Ives Cobb, while the grounds were designed by John Charles Olmsted. The observatory&#x27;s Greco-Roman façade has intricate stonework and carvings. The observatory houses the world&#x27;s largest refracting (lens) telescope, the great 40-inch, which saw first light in May 1897. The Observatory&#x27;s first Director was George Ellery Hale, who went on to establish Mount Wilson Observatory in Southern California. The observatory has been an important center of astronomical research. &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; was previously published at the observatory and the facility was the site of the first meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 1899. Albert Einstein visited the observatory during his first trip to the United States in 1921. The facility is operated by the Yerkes Future Foundation.

The Williams Bay Air Force Station served as a general surveillance radar station from 1950 to 1960. A historical marker on the site commemorates the 755th Radar Squadron.

In October 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led a three-day retreat of fellow activists and supporters at Conference Point Center. The purpose of the retreat was to develop a strategy to protest racial segregation in Chicago. The resulting plan became known as the Chicago Freedom Movement.

<doc id="139920" wikidata="Q2542618" url="?curid=139920" title="Sharp (music)">
<text>In music, sharp – eqv. &#x27; (from French) or &#x27; (from Greek ) – means higher in pitch. The sharp symbol, , indicates that the note to which the symbol is applied is played one semitone higher. The opposite of sharp is flat, indicating a lowering of pitch. The symbol derives from a square form of the letter &quot;b&quot; (see History of notation of accidentals for more information).

== Examples ==
The sharp symbol is used in key signatures or as an accidental applied to a single note. The staff below has a key signature with three sharps (A major or its relative minor, F minor). The sharp symbol placed on the note indicates that it is an A instead of an A.

:&lt;score&gt; {
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { \key a \major ais1 } }
&lt;/score&gt;
In twelve-tone equal temperament tuning (the predominant system of tuning in Western music), raising a note&#x27;s pitch by a semitone results in a note that is enharmonically equivalent to the adjacent named note. In this system, A and B are considered to be equivalent. However, in the majority of tuning systems, this is not the case.

== Variants ==
A double sharp () is indicated by the symbol and raises a note by two chromatic semitones. Historically, a double sharp was sometimes written , or .
:&lt;score&gt; { \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { bisis1 } }&lt;/score&gt;

A half sharp, or demisharp () raises a note by approximately a quarter tone. A sharp-and-a-half, three-quarter-tone sharp, or sesquisharp () raises a note by three quarter tones.

:&lt;score&gt;{
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { dih1 eisih } }&lt;/score&gt;

Although very uncommon, a triple sharp ( or ) can sometimes be found. It raises a note by three semitones or a whole tone and semitone. (For example, F is enharmonic with G.) 
:&lt;score&gt; { \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; {
 \tweak Accidental.stencil #ly:text-interface::print \tweak Accidental.text \markup { \concat { \sharp \doublesharp}} bis1
} }&lt;/score&gt;
== Key signature ==
In a key signature, sharps or flats are placed to the right of the clef. The pitches indicated apply in every measure and octave.

The order of sharps in key signature notation is F, C, G, D, A, E, B. Starting with no sharps or flats (C major), adding the first sharp (F) indicates G major, adding the next (C) indicates D major, and so on through the circle of fifths.

Some keys (such as C major with seven sharps) may be written as an enharmonically equivalent key (D major with five flats in this case). In rare cases, the sharp keys may be extended further, G → D → A → E → B → F → C, requiring double sharps in the key signature: F, C, G, D, A, E, B. These are called &quot;theoretical key signatures&quot;. This principle applies similarly to the flat keys.

== Temporary accidental ==
When used as a temporary accidental sign, sharps apply to the note on which they are placed, and to all subsequent similar notes in the same measure and octave. the sharp symbol is placed to the left of the note head.
:&lt;score&gt; { \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { bis1 } }&lt;/score&gt;
Temporary accidentals apply to the note on which they are placed, and to subsequent similar notes in the same measure. In modern notation they do not apply to notes in other octaves or measure, but this was not always the convention. If a sharp is used as an accidental, it can be cancelled on a subsequent similar note in the staff, measure and octave by using a flat () or a natural ().
:&lt;score&gt;{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \key c \major \time 4/4 bis&#x27;2 bes&#x27; bis&#x27; b&#x27;}&lt;/score&gt;

== Unicode ==
In Unicode, assigned sharp signs are as follows:
* 
* 
== Other notation and usage ==
* The sharp symbol () resembles the number (hash) sign (#), in that both have two intersecting sets of parallel double lines. While the number sign may have a pair of horizontal lines, the sharp sign has a pair of slanted lines that rise from left to right instead, to avoid obscuring the staff lines. The other set of parallel lines are vertical in the sharp sign, while the number sign (#) may have slanted lines instead. It is also etymologically independent from the number sign. Likewise, while the double-sharp sign resembles a bold-face lower-case x it needs to be typographically distinct.
* Historically, lowering a double sharp to a single sharp could be notated using a natural and sharp sign (♮♯) or vice-versa (♯♮) instead of the conventional sharp sign (♯), but the natural sign is often omitted in modern notation. The similar principle of the natural sign notation can apply when canceling a triple sharp or beyond. The combination can be also written when changing a flat to a sharp.

<text>Addison is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,341 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated communities of Addison, Allenton, Aurora, Nenno, and Saint Anthony are located with the town. The unincorporated community of Saint Lawrence is also located partially in the town.

==History==
In the early 19th century when the first white settlers arrived in Southeastern Wisconsin, the Potawatomi and Menominee Native Americans inhabited the land now occupied by the Town of Addison. In 1831, the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington. The Potawatomi surrendered their land claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The first white settlers were farmers who arrived in 1843 and 1844. The Town of Addison incorporated on January 21, 1846. At the time, it included the land that would become the Town of Wayne, which was partitioned from Addison on March 11, 1848. Many of the early settlers were German immigrants who operated crop and dairy farms.

Several small unincorporated hamlets formed in Addison, the largest of which is Allenton. Located on the east branch of the Rock River, the community formed in 1882 around a depot of the Wisconsin Central Railroad. In its early years, the hamlet provided a market for farmers to sell their produce, a bank, and a sawmill.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.2 square miles (93.7 km), all of it land.

<text>Barton is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,546 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Young America is located in the town.

==History==
The settlement of Barton began in 1845, when a land surveyor named Barton Salisbury arrived in the area from Mequon, and identified the rapids on the Milwaukee River as a potential source of hydropower. He built a sawmill, and soon other settlers arrived in the area, which was called Salisbury&#x27;s Mills at the time. Salisbury went on to found the Village of Newburg before he died in a construction accident in 1849.

In 1848, the state legislature created the Town of Newark from land that had previously been part of the Town of West Bend, and in 1853 the Washington County Board of Supervisors changed the name to the Town of Barton in honor of Barton Salisbury.

Many sawmills and gristmills sprang up on the river in the town&#x27;s early years, and by 1855, the town&#x27;s population was over 1,000, making it larger than neighboring West Bend. The first settlers were predominantly German immigrant farmers. The first church was a German Methodist church established in 1850. In 1852, the non-German settlers in the town organized the Presbyterian Society of Newark. The first Roman Catholic service in the town was held on Christmas Day, 1857. On August 12, 1858, an Austrian missionary named Father Caspar Rehrl established the Roman Catholic Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes in Barton and built the historic St. Agnes Convent and School. In its early years, the order was dedicated to education, and sisters worked in rural schools in Barton and surrounding communities.

In April of 1925, the Village of Barton was incorporated out of some of the town&#x27;s land. A vote was held in the Town of Barton to determine if a village should be incorporated on April 21st, 1925. The results of the vote were 134 in favor and 90 opposed. Later on September 12th, 1961 another vote was held in the city of West Bend and the village of Barton to determine if the village should consolidate into the city. The results in the village of Barton were 384 in favor and 187 opposed, while in West Bend it was 1,147 in favor and 643 opposed. The village was annexed by the City of West Bend on November 1, 1961. In the 21st century, much of the Town of Barton&#x27;s land is used for agriculture.

<text>Erin is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,664 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Thompson is located in Erin.

Erin is home to Erin Hills golf course which hosted the 2017 U.S. Open golf tournament.

==History==
Until the 1830s, the Erin area was home to Menominee and Potawatomi Native Americans Native American oral traditions claimed that Jesuit missionaries were the first white people to arrive in the area, possibly as early as the 1670s. Some historians have claimed that Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet stopped in the Erin area on their 1673–1674 journey to find the Rock River and planted a wooden cross on the summit of Holy Hill. However, no one has been able to determine with certainty who the first explorers to visit the area were, because Jesuit accounts often do not describe landmarks with specific enough details for historians to draw definitive conclusions.

The Potawatomi surrendered their claims to the land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Potawatomis moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Itinerant Native Americans lived in Washington County into the late 19th century, when many of them gathered in northern Wisconsin to form the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The Wisconsin Territorial Legislature created the Town of Erin on January 16, 1846. It was possibly named for Erin, the romantic, Hiberno-English name for Ireland, from which many many of the early settlers had emigrated. As recently as 1940, nearly ninety percent of the town&#x27;s population claimed Irish descent.

Since its founding, Erin has been a primarily agricultural community, with dairy farming playing an important role in the local economy. Early businesses included blacksmiths, general stores, and creameries that supported the local farmers.

Since the town&#x27;s first decades, Erin has had a large Catholic community. In the 1860s, a Catholic priest built a log chapel dedicated as a shrine to Mary Help of Christians on the summit of Holy Hill. The site attracted many pilgrims, and the log chapel was replaced with a brick church in 1881. In 1906, a group of Discalced Carmelite friars from Bavaria settled at Holy Hill and built a monastery in 1920. By 1925, the church could no longer accommodate the growing number of pilgrims, and between 1926 and 1931 two new churches were erected. Holy Hill has become one of the most visited Catholic pilgrimage sites in the Midwest, and was made a minor basilica in 2006.

For the first century of its history, the town&#x27;s population remained fairly stable, but following World War II, the town grew dramatically, with the population quadrupling between 1950 and 2010. Some areas saw the development of residential subdivisions, and beginning in the 1960s some residents opposed the suburbanization of the town. However, even today most of Erin remains a rural, agricultural community.

Farmington is located in the Kettle Moraine region of Wisconsin, home to unique geographical features formed by the Laurentide Ice Sheet, a massive glacier that covered much of Canada and the northern United States during the prehistoric Wisconsin glaciation. The town contains many kames, eskers, drumlins, kettles, rivers, and streams created by the glacier.

The north branch of the Milwaukee River flows through the town, as do Stony Creek and Wallace Creek. The town&#x27;s lakes, including Ehne Lake, Erler Lake, Green Lake, Lake Twelve, and Miller Lake, were are kettle lakes, created by the glaciers.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.7 square miles (95.0 km2), of which, 36.4 square miles (94.2 km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8 km2) of it (0.82%) is water.

==History==

The Farmington area&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants were pre-Columbian Mound Builders, who constructed effigy mounds sometime between 650 CE and 1300 CE. They survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants. They constructed tools from bone, wood, stone, and occasionally copper. They also made pottery. They were semi-nomadic. They built effigy mounds shaped like mammals, reptiles, birds and other creatures, both real and mythical, as well as conical, oval, and linear mounds, some of which contain human burials. At least forty-seven mounds, known as the Hagner Group, existed in Farmington. Some mounds were destroyed by white settlers to create farm fields, but twenty-eight survive as of 2020 in Lizard Mound County Park.

In the early 19th century, Farmington was home to Potawatomi and Menominee Native Americans. The Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government in 1831 through the Treaty of Washington. The Potawatomi surrendered the land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Native Americans who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

Farmington was part of the Town of West Bend until February 11, 1847, when the Wisconsin Territorial legislature created the Town of Clarence, which was renamed the Town of Farmington on March 11, 1848. The early settlers were predominantly German and Irish immigrants.

In the early 1850s, a group of immigrants from Saxony established Fillmore in the eastern part of the town. They named the settlement for Millard Fillmore, who was president at the time. Fillmore is the location of the 1855 Saxonia House brewery, which was a gathering place for locals. In 1862, some of the Saxon immigrants organized the Farmington Turnverein, a German cultural association, and in 1868, they built the Fillmore Turner Hall, which still stands as of 2020.

In 1854, Harlow Bolton established the Boltonville settlement on Stony Creek in the northeastern part of the town. The early settlers used the creek to power grist and saw mills. There was also a cheese factory, as well as shops, a post office, and a school.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, dairy farming was widespread in Farmington, leading to the construction of numerous cheese factories, including an 1871 factory in Orchard Grove and an 1881 factory in Cheeseville.

Farmington saw significant population growth in the final decades of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st century. The economy is still primarily agricultural, with roughly 60% of the land devoted to farming.

===Historic Places===
Farmington is home to four sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places:

*Lizard Mound County Park: A well-preserved cluster of twenty-eight pre-Columbian effigy mounds, including a 250-foot lizard mound, similarly sized panther and bird mounds, and smaller linear and conical mounds.

<text>Hartford is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. A portion of the city of Hartford within Washington County is located adjacent to the town, but the two are politically independent. The population of the town was 4,031 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Pike Lake is located in the town. The unincorporated community of Saint Lawrence is also located partially in the town.

==History==
In the early 19th century, Hartford was inhabited by the Potawatomi and Menominee people, who had a trading post on the Rubicon River and a village on the eastern shore of Pike Lake. In 1831, the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington, and the Potawatomi surrendered their land claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. However, when the first white settlers arrived in 1843, they found that the Potawatomi were still living at the Pike Lake village. Some Native Americans remained in the area and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Native people who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

In July 1843, Timothy Hall became the first white person to purchase and settle land in the Hartford area, although when he arrived he found a Canadian named Jehial Case squatting near his land. Later that year, German immigrant settlers John Theil and Nicolaus Simon surveyed the Hartford area and determined that the Rubicon River would be a suitable location for a hydropowered mill. The following year, James and George Rossman joined Simon and Theil&#x27;s venture. The men purchased forty acres abutting the rapids of the Rubicon River in what would become the City of Hartford and constructed a dam and a sawmill that harnessed the river&#x27;s power to make lumber from the old-growth forests covering the area. In 1846, a third Rossman brother, Charles, arrived in Hartford and constructed a gristmill to process grain grown by the settlers. On January 31, 1846, the land incorporated as the Town of Wright, before the name was changed to the Town of Hartford in February 1847, after Hartford, Connecticut. The early settlers cleared land for farming; constructed roads; created a post office; erected churches, the first being the First Congregational Church of Hartford which formed in 1847, and was followed by Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, and Catholic churches in the 1850s; and established businesses to serve the town&#x27;s agricultural economy, including equipment wholesalers, general stores, and dry goods dealers.

The La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad was constructed through the community in 1855, and while rail connections were important to Hartford&#x27;s growth into the early 1900s, the company failed in 1861. Many local landowners had taken out mortgages on land for the railroad in exchange for company shares. The company&#x27;s failure left the landowners with mortgages to pay off, creating a local crisis in which some families were forced to sell their farms. The &quot;Hartford Home League&quot; newspaper started during the crisis to advocate for the farmers.

The community&#x27;s early years saw increasing tension between the white settlers and their Native American neighbors. For example, on August 25, 1861, a group of approximately a dozen Native Americans were living near Horicon Marsh, northwest of Hartford. They owned a horse, which got loose and wandered into a neighboring settler&#x27;s cornfield. The settler shot and killed the horse, and the Native Americans vowed revenge. The story traveled quickly, becoming increasingly exaggerated as it spread. By the time the story reached Hartford on August 26, the dozen peaceful Native Americans had been transfigured into an army of 5,000 warriors preparing to massacre the settlers in the area. Many able-bodied men in Hartford armed themselves, formed a war party, and set out to fight the Native Americans. But when they arrived at Horicon Marsh they found that the threat was entirely fictional. The incident caused widespread fear among the Native Americans as well as in the surrounding communities. 

The City of Hartford incorporated out of some of the town&#x27;s land in 1883, and shifted from being a small market town serving the local farmers to being a larger industrial community, including the Kissel Motor Car Company; the International Stamping Company, which manufactured automobile parts; the Hartford Canning Company, which process local farmers&#x27; crops—particularly peas, which were a cash crop in the area; the knitting mills of the Paramount Knitting Company; a glove factory; three tanneries; and a brewery.

During World War II, the Town of Hartford&#x27;s farmers were affected by labor shortages, and in the summer of 1944, the U.S. military tried to remedy the problem by contracting German prisoners of war to work on pea farms. Initially, the prisoners were transported from a requisitioned hotel on Lake Keesus in Waukesha County. In October 1944, the military requisitioned the Schwartz Ballroom in the City of Hartford to serve as a prisoner of war camp for 600 Germans. The prisoners were contracted to work on farms as well as in canneries, hemp mills, dairy facilities, and tanneries. The camp closed in January 1946 and the prisoners were repatriated to Germany.

<text>Polk is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,938 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated communities of Ackerville, Cedar Creek, Cedar Lake, Diefenbach Corners, Mayfield, and Rugby Junction are located in the town. The town derives its name from James K. Polk, 11th U.S. president, who was in office when the town incorporated in 1846.

==History==
In the early 19th century, Polk was home to Potawatomi Native Americans, who surrendered the land to the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Potawatomis moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. One band of strolling Potawatomi travelled through Dodge, Jefferson, and Washington counties, and was led by Chief Kewaskum, who had a camp on Pike Lake, west of the Polk area. Kewaskum was friendly with the white settlers who began arriving in the 1840s. He died sometime between 1847 and 1850, and the early settlers named the Village of Kewaskum in his honor. Itinerant Potawatomis lived in Washington County into the late 19th century, when many of them gathered in northern Wisconsin to form the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

In 1843, William Williamson purchased forty acres of land and became the first white settler in the area. Densmore Maxon was another early settler, arriving in 1844 to purchase forty acres along Cedar Creek and build one of the first sawmills in the area. Maxon would become a prominent figure in the community&#x27;s early political scene. Baruch Schleisinger Weil arrived in 1845, purchasing nearly 2,000 acres and building a general store to supply settlers. The Town of Polk was organized on January 21, 1846, and named for James K. Polk, who was then President of the United States.

In 1855, Weil worked to have the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad pass through the Polk with a large depot on his land in Schleisingerville (present-day Slinger). The train also stopped at a station in the hamlet of Ackerville in the town. While the railroad initially led to local economic growth, the company failed in 1861. Many local landowners had taken out mortgages on land for the railroad in exchange for company shares. The company&#x27;s failure left the landowners with mortgages to pay off, creating a local crisis in which some families were forced to sell their farms. The railroad was purchased and operated by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad in 1863, and Schleisingerville continued to grow, incorporating as a village out of some of the town&#x27;s land in 1869.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the surrounding villages of Jackson, Richfield and Slinger, have annexed land from the town as they have grown and suburbanized. Despite losing some of its geographic area, the Town of Polk&#x27;s population has more than doubled since 1960.

<text>Richfield is a village in Washington County, Wisconsin, and is on the edge of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Area . United States. The population was 11,739 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated community of Hubertus, as Well as the Former Communities of Pleasant Hill and Plat are located in the village, as well as the communities of Colgate and Lake Five, which are partially located in Richfield. It is the birthplace of Alex Kister, who is revered for helping pioneer analog horror&#x27;s newfound fame.

==History==
The Richfield area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Menominee and Potawatomi peoples. In 1831, The Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington, and the Potawatomi surrendered claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually, the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

On May 31, 1841, a land speculator named Samuel Spivey purchased 600 acres of land in the Richfield, becoming the first white landowner in the Richfield area and marking the beginning of early settlement. Several weeks later, on July 9, 1841, Jacob Snyder purchased land in the area and settled in Richfield, becoming the first white permanent resident. By 1843, German immigrants − particularly from Hesse-Darmstadt − were building farms in the area, and the community began to form. A group of German Catholics built the community&#x27;s first church in 1845 and dedicated it to Saint Hubertus. Today, the community that formed around the church also bears the saint&#x27;s name.

The Town of Richfield was organized on January 21, 1846, and by 1848 almost all of the town&#x27;s land was owned by Irish and German immigrant farmers. Wheat farming dominated the local economy until 1880, when dairy farming became more popular in Richfield and the state at large.

The La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad was constructed through the community in 1855, and while it initially led to local economic growth, the company failed in 1861. Many local landowners had taken out mortgages on land for the railroad in exchange for company shares. The company&#x27;s failure left the landowners with mortgages to pay off, creating a local crisis in which some families were forced to sell their farms.

In the early 20th century, camps and other recreational facilities began to spring up on the shores of the numerous kettle lakes in Richfield, including YMCA Camp Minikani on Lake Amy Belle, which was founded in 1919.

The town was primarily agricultural until the 1970s when suburbanization led to increased real estate development and a decline in farming. On November 6, 2007, voters approved the town&#x27;s incorporation as the Village of Richfield by a margin of 3 to 1. The town became a village on February 13, 2008.

<text>Slinger (formerly Schleisingerville) is a village in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 5,992 at the 2020 census, and Slinger is on the outer edge of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Area

==Toponymy==
The village was originally known as Schleisingerville, after Baruch Schleisinger Weil, a merchant and politician who developed the community as a railroad stop in the 1840s and 1850s. Locals sometimes abbreviated the four-syllable name to &quot;Slinger,&quot; and on May 3, 1921, the village residents overwhelmingly voted to make Slinger the official name.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the Slinger area was home to Potawatomi Native Americans, who surrendered the land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Potawatomis moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. One band of strolling Potawatomi travelled through Dodge, Jefferson, and Washington counties, and was led by Chief Kewaskum, who had a camp on Pike Lake, west of Slinger. Kewaskum was friendly with the white settlers who began arriving in the 1840s. He died sometime between 1847 and 1850, and the early settlers named the Village of Kewaskum in his honor. Itinerant Potawatomis lived in Washington County into the late 19th century, when many of them gathered in northern Wisconsin to form the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

Baruch Schleisinger Weil, a Jewish-American immigrant from Strasbourg, Alsace, laid the village&#x27;s foundation when he bought 2,000 acres of land in Washington County on November 1, 1845. He soon built a general store to serve local farmers, loggers and Native Americans, and later opened a distillery. Other merchants and manufacturers, including blacksmiths, shoemakers, wagon makers and tanners, began settling in the area, which was called &quot;Schleisingerville&quot; in Weil&#x27;s honor. For the first two decades of its history, the community was part of the Town of Polk, which was organized on January 21, 1846.

In 1850, Weil opened a post office and in 1855 he worked to have the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad pass through the community. The rail line was completed on August 23, 1855. The village grew because of its rail connections and incorporated out of some of the Town of Polk&#x27;s land in 1869.

<text>Trenton is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,440 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Myra is located within the town.

==Geography==
The Milwaukee River bisects the Town of Trenton. The north branch of Cedar Creek runs through the town. Wallace Lake is in the northwestern corner of the town on the boundary with the Town of Barton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 33.5 square miles (86.7 km2), of which, 33.4 square miles (86.5 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) of it (0.21%) is water.

==History==
Potawatomi and Menominee Native Americans lived along the Milwaukee River until the 1830s. In 1836, land speculators, including Milwaukee founder Solomon Juneau bought land in what would become the Town of Trenton. However, permanent settlers did not arrive in the area until 1845. Many of the early settlers were German immigrant farmers. Dairy farming has been the main economic activity for much of the town&#x27;s history, and the Wallau Dairy Company of West Bend operated a large cheese factory on the town&#x27;s west side in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The Town of Trenton was incorporated on March 11, 1848.

In 1848, Barton Salisbury built a dam on the Milwaukee River to generate power for his feed and saw mills. The area around his mills would become the Village of Newburg, the most significant settlement in Trenton.

As early as 1848, a group of Free Will Baptists from New England settled in northwestern Trenton, near Wallace Lake. They were led by Reverend Comfort Babcock Waller, who also founded a Free Will Baptist community in Scott, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. The group performed immersion baptisms on the lake&#x27;s northeastern shore, even going so far as to cut holes in the ice to baptize their members in the dead of winter. The community members dispersed in the 1860s; some of them established a new church in nearby Boltonville in 1872.

In November 1862 during the American Civil War, the draft was unpopular with some residents. On the day Trenton men were being drafted at the courthouse in West Bend, a mob disrupted the proceedings and forced the draft commissioner to flee to Milwaukee. On November 22, 1862, the commissioner returned to West Bend with six companies of the 30th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment to prevent further disruptions.

Bohemian immigrants settled in the community of Myra in the 19th century.

In the 20th century, Trenton lost some of its geographic area when the neighboring City of West Bend annexed land for residential subdivisions, commercial developments and the West Bend Municipal Airport. Additionally, Newburg incorporated as a village in 1973 out of the town&#x27;s land.

In the 21st century, Trenton has become a commuter town with approximately half of its residents working outside Washington County.

<text>Wayne is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,182 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated communities of Kohlsville and Wayne are located in the town.

==History==
In the early 19th century when the first white settlers arrived in Southeastern Wisconsin, the Potawatomi and Menominee Native Americans inhabited the land now occupied by the Town of Wayne. In 1831, the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington. The Potawatomi surrendered their land claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1833) required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Native people who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The first white settlers arrived in 1846, when the land was part of the Town of Addison and largely covered with dense hardwood forests. The Town of Wayne incorporated on March 11, 1848, and was named for General Anthony Wayne, who served in the American Revolution. The first settlers were mostly Yankees and Irish immigrants, but beginning around 1850 many German immigrants began to settle in the town, and by 1880 the population was almost entirely of German descent.

The town population remained small throughout its history. Unlike neighboring towns, Wayne never had any railroad connections, and the hamlets of Kohlsville, St. Kilians, and Wayne Center remained rural communities that served the local farmers, unlike hamlets in neighboring towns which grew and prospered with construction of new railroads. Beginning in the 1970s, Wayne&#x27;s population began to increase, nearly doubling from 1,214 in 1970 to 2,169 in 2010. However, as of the 2010s, Wayne has the second-lowest housing density in Washington County, and more than 60 percent of the land is zoned agricultural.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.8 square miles (92.7 km2), all of it land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,727 people, 582 households, and 485 families residing in the town. The population density was 48.2 people per square mile (18.6/km2). There were 597 housing units at an average density of 16.7 per square mile (6.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.25% White, 0.23% Native American, 0.12% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, and 0.35% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.17% of the population.

There were 582 households, out of which 38.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 77.3% were married couples living together, 3.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.5% were non-families. 10.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.97 and the average family size was 3.24.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.6% under the age of 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 32.4% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 8.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.7 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $61,033, and the median income for a family was $64,297. Males had a median income of $41,200 versus $23,889 for females. The per capita income for the town was $21,995. About 0.8% of families and 2.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under age 18 and 4.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Hygena Spring #2==

In the late 1860s, Waukesha County was known as the “Saratoga of the West” due to plentiful, clean, and pure springs. At a time when many major municipal water supplies were tainted, the springs of Waukesha County were believed to have healing properties. They drew thousands of visitors to the springs and bath houses located in the county.

During the early 1890s, local entrepreneur James M McElroy hatched a plan to pipe water from the Hygeia Spring, located in the Town of Waukesha, more than 100 miles to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Despite the fresh water of Lake Michigan, the Chicago River was contaminated with raw sewage, and many feared the water shortage would dissuade people from attending the exhibition. McElroy was to receive 8.5 cents per gallon, after commission, for shipping the water from Waukesha to Chicago.

On May 12, 1892, a trainload of laborers and iron pipe were forced to retreat from the spring when village residents, armed with cannons and rifles, ordered them to leave the spring alone. Locals feared the mass pumping from the spring would destroy other springs in the area. After this mishap, McElroy purchased a spring outside of the Town of Waukesha in what is now the Village of Big Bend. He called it Hygena Springs II. McElroy did build his 100-mile pipe to Chicago, but once the water reached the exhibition, it was said to be stale and tasteless.

Hygena Spring II still flows today. Though the spring is located on private property, the owners allow the public to enjoy the water.

<text>Butler is a village in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,787 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The village of Butler exists due to the railroad. It began in the season of fall in 1909, when people from the Milwaukee, Sparta, and North Western Railway (a division of the Chicago and North Western Railway) visited farmers living on the eastern area of 124th Street and bought their land to start railroad yards around the City of Milwaukee to relieve congestion in the downtown rail yards. These railroad yards were called &quot;New Butler&quot;. Butler was probably named for William Butler, a large property owner in the area who had emigrated from England in the mid-1840s. In 1911, the settlement of &quot;New Butler&quot; was started within Waukesha County, Wisconsin. This community was started by railroad workers and their families and was incorporated with 200 people on May 5, 1913, from what land that was previously parts of the towns of Brookfield and Menomonee. The village grew as more railroad activities started, and allowed real estate speculators to buy parcels of additional land for development. In 1926 the &quot;New&quot; was removed from the name of the village.

<text>Chenequa is a village in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. It encompasses all of Pine Lake, a southern portion of North Lake, and the western portion of Beaver Lake. The population was 526 at the 2020 census. The village was incorporated in 1928.

==History==
The first settlers in the area were Gustaf Unonius; his wife, Charlotta Margareta Ohrstromer; her nursemaid; Christine Soedergren; Carl Groth; and Wilhelm Pearmain.

The village was formed from the Town of Merton in 1928 by wealthy Milwaukeeans who owned summer homes in the area and were concerned about the level of police protection provided. Forming their own village allowed them to have their own police department. The town of Merton, which objected to the formation of the village because of the loss of tax revenue, filed suit to prevent the incorporation. It was supported by hundreds of town residents who filed petitions with the court. In January 1928, the court determined that the village of Chenequa could incorporate. The judge addressed the local residents&#x27; complaint that the public would be shut off from access to the lake by stating that, &quot;There is no merit to such contention.

<doc id="139950" wikidata="Q7001368" url="?curid=139950" title="Flat (music)">
<text>In music, flat means lower in pitch. It may either be used generically, meaning any lowering of pitch, or refer to a particular size: lowering pitch by a chromatic semitone. A flat is the opposite of a sharp () which raises pitch by the same amount that a flat lowers it.

The flat symbol () is used in two ways: It is placed in key signatures to mark lines whose notes are flattened throughout that section of music; it may also be an &quot;accidental&quot; that precedes an individual note and indicates that the note should be lowered temporarily, until the following bar line.

== Pitch change ==
The flat symbol, , is a stylised lowercase &quot;b&quot;, derived from Italian &quot;be molle&quot; for &quot;soft B&quot; and German &quot;blatt&quot; for &quot;planar, dull&quot;. It indicates that the note to which it is applied is played one semitone lower, or in modern tuning exactly 100 cents.

In traditional and modern microtonal temperaments the size of sharps or flats (chromatic semitones) is normally smaller than the size of the diatonic semitones found between or In those tuning systems, the size of the shift made by the symbol usually conforms to the smaller-sized lowering of pitch; however, for some tuning systems it may instead be replaced by a different symbol for raising and lowering pitch, depending on the author&#x27;s preference and the intricacy of any microtuning involved.

== Related symbols ==
A &quot;double flat&quot; lowers a note by two semitones, or a whole step.
:&lt;score&gt;{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { beses1 } }&lt;/score&gt;

A &quot;quarter-tone flat&quot;, &quot;half flat&quot;, or &quot;demiflat&quot; indicates the use of quarter tones; it may be marked with various symbols including a flat with a slash () or a reversed flat sign (). A &quot;three-quarter-tone flat&quot;, &quot;flat and a half&quot; or &quot;sesquiflat&quot;, is represented by a demiflat and a whole flat ().

The symbols , , , among others, represent &quot;comma&quot; flat or eighth-tone flat, or a quarter of a flat (not to be confused with the larger quarter tone).

:&lt;score&gt;{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { ceh1 deseh } }&lt;/score&gt;

Although very rarely used, a &quot;triple flat&quot; can sometimes be found. It lowers a note three semitones, or a whole tone and a semitone. (For example, B는 is enharmonic with A♭.)
:&lt;score&gt; {
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; {
 \tweak Accidental.stencil #ly:text-interface::print \tweak Accidental.text \markup { \concat { \flat \doubleflat }}beses1
&lt;/score&gt;
The symbol of a &quot;quadruple flat&quot; , or beyond could be used, but would be extremely rare in ordinary temperament.
:&lt;score&gt;{
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; {
 \tweak Accidental.stencil #ly:text-interface::print \tweak Accidental.text \markup { \concat { \doubleflat \doubleflat }}beses1
} }&lt;/score&gt;

== Flats used in key signatures ==
The order of &quot;flats&quot; added onto the key signature is
: B, E, A, D, G, C, F.
The corresponding order of &quot;keys&quot; is off by one:
: F, B, E, A, D, G, C.
Starting with no sharps or flats (C major), adding the first flat (B) indicates F major; adding the next (E) indicates B major, and so on, backwards through the circle of fifths.

Some keys (such as C major with seven flats) may be written as an enharmonically equivalent key (B major with five sharps in this case). In rare cases, the flat keys may be extended further:
: F → B → E → A → D → G → C 
requiring double flats in the key signature. These are called &quot;theoretical key signatures&quot;, based on the impracticality of their use, rather than the simpler, equivalent key in This principle applies similarly to the sharp keys.

=== Key signature example ===
The staff below shows a key signature with three flats (E major or its relative minor C minor), followed by a note with a flat preceding it: The flat symbol placed on the note indicates that it is a D.

:&lt;score&gt;{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { \key es \major des1 } }&lt;/score&gt;

In 12 tone equal temperament lowering a note&#x27;s pitch by a semitone results in a note that is enharmonically equivalent to the adjacent named note. In this system, B and A are considered to be equivalent. In most tuning systems, however, this is not the case.

== Temporary accidentals ==
When flats are used as a temporary accidental sign, the flat symbol is placed to the left of the note head.&lt;score&gt; { \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { bes1 } }&lt;/score&gt;
Temporary accidentals apply to the note on which they are placed, and to all subsequent similar notes in the same measure and octave. In modern notation they do not apply to notes in other octaves, but this was not always the convention. To cancel an accidental signature later in the same staff, measure and octave, another accidental such as a natural (♮) or a sharp (♯) may be used.

&lt;score&gt;{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \key c \major \time 4/4 bes&#x27;2 b&#x27; bes&#x27;! bis&#x27;}&lt;/score&gt;
==Other notation and usage==

* Historically, raising a double flat to a single flat would be notated using a natural and flat sign (♮♭) or vice-versa (♭♮) instead of the conventional flat sign (♭). In modern notation the leading natural sign is often omitted. The similar principle of the natural sign notation can apply when canceling a triple flat or beyond. The combination can be also written when changing a flat to a sharp.
*:&lt;score&gt;{
\omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&quot; { beses2 bes2 \accidentalStyle modern beses2 bes2
&lt;/score&gt; 
* In environments where the symbol is not supported, or in specific text notation, a double flat can be written as , two lower-case b&#x27;s (), etc. Likewise, a triple flat can also be written as , etc.
* In environments where the or 𝄳 symbol is not supported, or in specific text notation, a half flat can be written as , etc. Likewise, a flat and a half can also be written as ♭, , etc.
* To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a flat as an accidental to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.

The boundaries originally included what are now Pewaukee, Brookfield, and Menomonee Falls before those three were also granted town status in 1839. The town government of Lisbon first met on April 15, 1842, in the future Lisbon Plank Schoolhouse.

The village of Sussex was founded in the middle of the town in 1924, and over time annexed pieces of the town of Lisbon. The town&#x27;s economy relied on farms and stone quarries for much of its history. Lannon stone, a glacial dolomitic limestone, continues to be mined in the town along with gravel deposits.

Lisbon sought incorporation in 2011 and 2020 before the state approved the town&#x27;s efforts to proceed with a referendum, which was held in January 2023. Residents approved incorporation as a village, which was certified by the state in February 2023.

<text>Menomonee Falls is a village in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. Its population was 38,527 at the 2020 census, making it the most-populous village in Wisconsin. It is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==

The area that became Menomonee Falls was first inhabited by Native Americans, including the people of the Menominee and Chippewa tribes. The town of Menomonee was created in December 1839.

The Menomonee Falls area continued to grow throughout the 1870s. By 1890, the population of the area was 2,480. In 1892, a section of the town of Menomonee was incorporated as the village of Menomonee Falls. In 1894, the first village board was elected and the first village fire department formed. After becoming a village, many important buildings were built, including the village hall/fire station, Menomonee Falls High School, and the Wisconsin Sugar Factory. The Wisconsin Sugar Factory employed as many as 500 laborers and produced up to 15 million pounds of sugar annually.

The first public telephone service was offered in 1902; a local electricity plant offered a substitute for kerosene lamps by 1907; water mains were installed in the 1910s; and the first sewer lines were laid in 1924. New neighborhoods were developed and the Menomonee Falls Public Library was built. The village&#x27;s second bank, the Farmers and Merchants Bank, was established in 1908 by attorney Samuel A. Connell. By 1910, automobiles started being sold in the village, which led to an increase in paved roads. By 1919, Highway 15 connected Menomonee Falls to Milwaukee and Illinois and, by 1922, to Green Bay.

In the early 20th century, a new municipal building was built to house village offices, the fire department, the police department, and a new Menomonee Falls Public Library. A subdivision named Hiawatha Heights added 58 single-family homes with 95% of the home buyers relocating from Milwaukee. By 1940, the population had risen to 3,674. Along with all of this, the building of shopping areas had begun, including the Hiawatha Shopping Center, which today can be seen along Appleton Avenue, with Krueger&#x27;s Entertainment and Pop&#x27;s Custard as the main attractions. In the 1950s, more subdivisions were built, and US 41 was completed. This increased the attractiveness of Menomonee Falls, as an easy commute to Milwaukee jobs was now possible. In 1958, the village of Menomonee Falls annexed the remainder of the Town of Menomonee, which increased the total area from 2 to 32 square miles and the population from 4,500 to 12,000.

In the 1960s, the school district built six new schools because of population growth in the baby-boom era. In 1965, a can manufacturing plant with a capacity of 150 million cans per year was established in the village, owned by Containers, Inc., a joint venture of the Miller Brewing Company and Carnation Company. &quot;By the end of the 1960s, 48% of the population in the village was 19 years old or under.&quot; Both a better park system and better public services were developed. Several full-time police officers were hired, along with full-time firefighters. Shopping centers were developed and major employers established in the village, including Harley-Davidson and Wacker Neuson. Old structures were razed to make way for several new streets.

Near the end of the 20th century, Menomonee Falls continued to grow in population. Between 1990 and 2010, the population had grown by almost 9,000. New subdivisions and apartments were built in the community. Reports in 2016 state, &quot;As of 2016, the Village had an estimated 36,907 residents and had become an important economic hub of Greater Milwaukee area.&quot; Major business developments include Kohl&#x27;s Corporate campus and the Westbrook Corporate Center. A new village hall/municipal center was built and a new library.

Southwestern portions of Menomonee Falls lie within the Hamilton School District, which also serves all of the communities of Sussex, Lannon, and Butler, portions of Lisbon, and a small part of Pewaukee.

In 2023, $250,000 were cut from the Menomonee Falls Public Library budget and three library board members were ousted with little to no transparency to the public. Fears mounted that the board would close the library because residents are, according to Brad Jubber, the village board representative on the Library Board at the time, &quot;affluent and can buy their own books.&quot;

<text>Muskego () is a city in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 25,032. It is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

The name Muskego is derived from the Potawatomi Indian name for the area, &quot;Mus-kee-Guaac&quot;, meaning sunfish. The Potawatomi were the original inhabitants of Muskego. Muskego is the fifth-largest community in Waukesha County, and has a large Norwegian American population. There are three lakes within the city&#x27;s boundaries.

==History==
The history of Muskego started originally as the home of the Potawatomi, who named it &quot;Mus-kee-Guaac&quot;, which means &quot;sunfish&quot;. The first European came in 1827 and a few years later (1833), the Potawatomi tribe ceded their lands in Wisconsin to the United States government. The first permanent settlers, coming from New Hampshire, were the Luther Parker family.

Once an agricultural area, Muskego was incorporated as a city in 1964. When it became a city it included the unincorporated communities of Durham Hill and Tess Corners. With an increase in housing developments in the city, it has become a bedroom community for Milwaukee.

===Muskego Beach Amusement Park===
Muskego Beach Amusement Park (1861–1967), later known as DandiLion Park (1968–1977), was a popular amusement park located on the southern bank of Little Muskego Lake. It was at some point home of the world&#x27;s fastest roller coaster.

Charles Rose, operator of Wisconsin State Fair Park, purchased Muskego Beach Amusement Park from Mrs. William Boszhardt in 1944. After World War II, he reopened it. The park included rides, games of chance, the Tailspin wooden roller coaster (1955) and was a venue for musical bands. Charles Rose died in 1963 and five years later, Willard Masterson purchased the park. He renamed it &quot;DandiLion Park&quot; and added more amusement rides. In 1974, an eleven-year-old boy fell from the Ferris wheel and died.

Bass Bay has a maximum depth of and has a bottom substrate of predominantly muck with some isolated sandy shoreline areas.

Little Muskego Lake is a flow-through lake with extensive shallow margins and a single deep basin. Located in the northwestern quadrant of the city, the lake has a maximum depth of and averages deep. The bottom substrate predominantly consists of silt or muck. Residents and visitors to Little Muskego Lake enjoy a variety of lake-related recreational activities, including boating, skiing, sailing, and fishing. The Muskego Waterbugs perform a water ski show in front of Idle Isle Park each Wednesday evening throughout the summer. The lake contains many fish species including: largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and several panfish species. Most of the shores of Little Muskego Lake are developed with residential housing.

Lake Denoon is a lake in the southwestern portion of the city and is also partially located in the Town of Norway, Wisconsin. The lake has a glacially formed kettle basin that reaches a maximum depth of with bottom substrates varying from sands and gravel to muck. An outlet stream on the south end drains to Ke-Nong-Go-Mong (Long) Lake in Racine County. A cattail island and an extent of cattail shoreline are found on the lake&#x27;s west end. The remaining lakeshore is mostly developed with residential housing.

A plan to drain the lakes, which were described as a stagnant nuisance, was proposed in 1854.

<text>New Berlin () is a city in eastern Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 40,451 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==Pronunciation==
Area residents put the accent on the first syllable of Berlin (), rather than the second.

==History==
The first settlers, Sidney Evans and P.G. Harrington, arrived in the northeastern part of what is now New Berlin in 1836. The area first came under local government in 1838 as part of the Town of Muskego, which at the time was composed of New Berlin and Muskego. The area that is now New Berlin was separated from Muskego in 1839 and named the Town of Mentor.

On January 13, 1840, Mentor became New Berlin. It was named by Evans after his hometown, New Berlin, New York. The town remained a rural and agricultural area until the 1940s, when the westward migration to the suburbs from Milwaukee began. Between 1850 and 1950, New Berlin&#x27;s population went from 1,293 to 5,334. Ten years later, in 1960, the population had nearly tripled to 15,788. The Town of New Berlin became the City of New Berlin with its incorporation in 1959.

Large-scale growth occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly as a result of the construction of the New Berlin Industrial Park, which began in 1964. The park comprises three separate business parks encompassing , including Moorland Road Industrial Park, New Berlin Industrial Park and MSI/Lincoln Avenue Industrial Park.

The School District of New Berlin&#x27;s school board voted to close Glen Park Elementary School in 2012. This resulted in around 300 students being transferred to either Elmwood, Ronald Reagan, or Orchard Lane elementary schools before the Fall term in 2012. In 2015, the building began functioning as a middle and high school for Heritage Christian Schools, which had acquired the property in 2014. Heritage Christian Schools was originally established in 1973 under the name Bethel Christian Academy, operating in affiliation with the Bethel Baptist Church. In 1975, the institution restructured as a non-denominational K–8 school and adopted the name Heritage Christian Schools. Over time, the school expanded its educational offerings to include high school programs.

Interstate 43 was expanded at the Moorland Road exit to accommodate a growing number of commuters. The new interchange has a two-lane roundabout that has been the center of a great deal of controversy because of the high number of accidents and traffic backups on 43.

==Geography==
New Berlin is located at (42.979063, −88.109188). It straddles the Sub-Continental Divide, which runs north–south through the eastern part of the city.

The remaining area is within the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence River drainage basin.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Environment==
An oil spill occurred at Moorland Auto Repair in New Berlin on March 16, 2023. The spill was caused by employees attempting to move a 350-gallon oil storage tote that became damaged in the process. The oil then entered the city&#x27;s stormwater system, a retention pond, and the creek behind the homes along Mark Drive. The property owner did not report the spill to the city or the Department of Natural Resources, as required by law. The incident was not reported until March 22, when a resident reported a strong petroleum smell. First responders deployed containment booms and oil spill mats to reduce the spread of oil. City officials at the time made statements about the expected lengthy cleanup. The city spent tens of thousands of dollars on cleanup efforts.

==Infrastructure==
The Utility Service Area is supplied with water from Lake Michigan, which is purchased from the Milwaukee Water Works. In the eastern portion of the city, wastewater is returned to Lake Michigan via the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District sewer system. The western portions of the city, outside of the Utility Service Area, use groundwater/private wells as their water supply source. Four municipal wells act in a reserve capacity. The groundwater acquired from these wells is found in two distinct shallow water bearing geologic formations, or aquifers. The water from these aquifers is radium compliant.

New Berlin is located mainly north of Interstate 43 on the latter&#x27;s course from Beloit to Milwaukee and Green Bay, and south of Interstate 94 between Waukesha and Milwaukee. WIS 59 runs through the northern border of the city as Greenfield Road. Other major roads include Moorland Road, and National Avenue (old WIS 15). The Union Pacific line between Milwaukee and Waukesha runs through New Berlin. The line once had passenger service until the 1950s and extended to Lancaster.

<text>North Prairie is a village in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. It is located in the Town of Genesee, near the town&#x27;s southwestern corner. The population was 2,202 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Thomas Sugden and two fellow prospectors from Mukwonago named the village in 1826 (they had gotten this far, &quot;and, as they did not go any farther north, they concluded to call this North Prairie&quot;). Blacksmiths from Eagle, Chas. Raynaus and Mr. Denny, were the first settlers to arrive that following year, although the first claim came from Stillman Smith. Farmers began to settle the North Prairie in the 1830s to raise their prize livestock and grain. The population grew and in 1840 Raynaus began the first school from his house.

By 1850 the village had a general store and post office. The Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad went through in 1852, but the village remained mostly rural. North Prairie would later become one of the area&#x27;s more noted residential centers. A rumor of oil in 1866 enabled the North Prairie Petroleum Company to fund $50,000 &quot;to dig a hole &amp; extract oil or minerals,&quot; but this venture was a failure.

St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church was built in 1877 and North Prairie later incorporated in 1919. Morey Milk Condensery opened a plant in 1917 and by 1920 North Prairie saw a jump in growth due to this industry. Morey Milk employed over 200 people and became a primary source of income to more than 85% of the village households. The plant was sold in 1924 and is no longer in operation.

In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2003, the previous owners of Bill&#x27;s Self-Service and Mini-Mart, Bill and Avis McKenzie, described how the village boomed in the 1940s and 1950s. &quot;We had three grocery stores, a hardware store, a mill, a granary, a post office, a drug store with eating counter, a few taverns with eating space, and three service stations, which at that time all had garages for car repair... One by one, they left town. Now we have one tavern, two service stations, a diner - and Bill&#x27;s Service.&quot;

<text>Clintonville is a city in Waupaca County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,591 at the 2020 census. The area that became Clintonville was first settled in March, 1855.

==History==
Clintonville lies within ancestral Menominee territory. In the Menominee language, it is known as &quot;Omīniahkan,&quot; &quot;place where pigeons are hunted&quot;. It was ceded to the United States by the Menominee in 1836 through the Treaty of the Cedars, an agreement to sell over four million acres to the United States as part of the negotiations about how to accommodate the Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brothertown peoples who were being removed from New York to Wisconsin. After this, the area around Clintonville became available for purchase by white American settlers.

In March, 1855 Norman Clinton and his family U. P. Clinton, Boardman Luman, and Mandy settled along the bank of the Pigeon River. They built the first establishment that grew into the city of Clintonville. The home they built was constructed of poles covered with hemlock boughs. It was used until a more suitable home built of logs could be constructed. They had drinking water from two large springs located on the bank of the river “Whose delicious water had flowed unmolested since the creation of the Universe.”

In March 2012, mysterious booms were heard by some in the city. The U.S. Geological Survey detected a 1.5 magnitude microearthquake nearby on March 21 that geophysicists said might have produced the sounds.

The Town of Lind was established on March 5, 1852, as one of the first towns in Waupaca County, along with Centerville (now Little Wolf), Dayton, Embarrass, Mukwa, Waupaca, and Weyauwega. The town was named for Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind. The first town meeting was held at the house of Thomas Spencer, where the following set of first officers were elected.

* Chairman: Lyman Dayton
* Supervisors: J.W. Chandler, Charles Beadleston
* Justices of the Peace: J.H. Jones, S. Warner
* Town Clerk: J.L. Rice

==Education==
The town was served by 7 &quot;one-room&quot; schools throughout the 1800s and 1900s. However, today, students in Lind attend Waupaca High School or Weyauwega-Fremont High School. One brick school, at the intersection of County Road A and County Road EE, closed in 1960 and is currently used as the town hall and community center. A small playground and artesian well are also located on the property.

<text>Little Wolf is a town in Waupaca County, Wisconsin, United States.

== History ==
The town was first settled by William Goldberg in 1848, who was joined by George E. and J.P. More in 1849, and James and Peter Meiklejohn in 1850. The first settlements straddled the river on the southern border of the township. The town was at first known as Centerville, and was organized on March 5, 1852. On November 15, 1854, the town changed its name to Little Wolf. After Jack Brickley built the first bridge across the river in 1858, it was also known as Brickley Bridge, but the name Little Wolf stuck after A. P. Jones established a new town post office in January 1859.

The Town of Royalton separated from Little Wolf in 1853. The towns Town of Union was separated from Little Wolf in 1857, with the Town of Dupont separating from the Town of Union in 1864.

The area grew fairly quickly in just ten years. Goldberg and the Mores built a sawmill there in 1849. Andrew Van Adestine fired up a smithy, Dan Smith and A. P. Jones opened groceries, and Jack Brickley bridged the river. Although Peter Meiklejohn set aside a room in his house for the village&#x27;s first teacher, Miss Fortner, to use as a class room in 1853, the village raised a school house in 1857, the same year that Meikeljohn opened a grist mill on the southwest bank of the river. A two-story hotel, also operated by the Meiklejohns, stood near the grist mill.

Little Wolf never grew much bigger, though, and probably began to decline in the 1870s, after another lumbermill was built upriver in 1871, and the railroad was routed through Manawa in 1873. Until recently, the hotel and the foundations of the grist mill were all that remained to show that the village ever existed. Today, even the hotel is gone.
