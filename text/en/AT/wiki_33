<text>My Bloody Valentine (often stylised in all lowercase or abbreviated as MBV) are an Irish-English rock band formed in Dublin in 1983 and consisting since 1987 of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar, sampler) and Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums, sampler), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). Their work is characterized by distorted guitar textures, subdued androgynous vocals, and unorthodox production techniques. They are widely cited as a pioneering act in the shoegaze genre.

Following several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released several successful EPs and the albums &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; (1988) and &quot;Loveless&quot; (1991) on the label; the latter is often described as their magnum opus. However, My Bloody Valentine were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album&#x27;s extensive production costs. In 1992, the band signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive.

Googe and Ó Cíosóig left the band in 1995; they were followed by Butcher in 1997. Unable to complete a follow-up to &quot;Loveless&quot;, Shields isolated himself and, in his own words, &quot;went crazy&quot;. In 2007, My Bloody Valentine reunited and subsequently embarked on a world tour. They released the compilation &quot;EP&#x27;s 1988-1991&quot; in 2012. Their long-delayed third studio album, , was released in 2013 to critical acclaim and was supported by further touring.

==History==

===1978–1985: Formation===
In 1978, Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig were introduced to each other at a karate tournament in South Dublin. The duo became friends in what has been described as &quot;an almost overnight friendship&quot; and later formed the Complex, a punk rock band, with Liam Ó Maonlaí, Ó Cíosóig&#x27;s friend from Coláiste Eoin. The band, who performed &quot;a handful of gigs&quot; consisting of Sex Pistols and Ramones songs, disbanded when Ó Maonlaí left to form Hothouse Flowers. Shields and Ó Cíosóig later formed A Life in the Day, a post-punk trio, but failed to secure performances with more than a hundred people present.

Following A Life in the Day&#x27;s dissolution, Shields and Ó Cíosóig formed My Bloody Valentine in early 1983 with bass player Mark Loughlin (nowadays recording as The Engineer) and lead vocalist David Conway. Conway, who performed under the pseudonym Dave Stelfox, suggested a number of potential band names, including the Burning Peacocks and performed a single gig under that name before the quartet changed the name to My Bloody Valentine. At the time the band saw the trailer for My Bloody Valentine on a rented VHS movie that they were watching during downtime on a weekend rehearsal at Kevin Shields parents home. Subsequently Shields has claimed he was unaware that My Bloody Valentine was the title of a 1981 Canadian slasher film when the name was suggested. 
Second guitarist Stephen Ivers also joined the band at this time
My Bloody Valentine experienced a number of line-up changes during their initial months. Lead guitarist Stephen Ivers and bassist Loughlin were recruited in April 1983 and the band would often rehearse near Smithfield and Temple Bar in rehearsal spaces owned by Alan Furlong. Walsh, who booked some of the band&#x27;s early performances, said the rehearsals were &quot;too noisy&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot; that &quot;next door were giving out hell&quot;. Loughlin left the band in December 1983 and was replaced by Paul Murtagh, who left the band in early 1984. In March 1984, Shields, Ivers and Conway recorded the band&#x27;s first demo on a four-track recorder in Shields&#x27; parents&#x27; home in Killiney. Shields and Ó Cíosóig overdubbed bass and drum tracks at Litton Lane Studios, and the tape was later used to secure a contract with Tycoon Records.

Soon after recording the demo, Ivers left My Bloody Valentine and Conway&#x27;s girlfriend, Tina Durkin, joined as a keyboard player. Around this time, Conway, on the suggestion of Shields, contacted Gavin Friday, the lead vocalist of the post-punk band Virgin Prunes. According to Shields, Conway approached Friday in Finglas, asked him for advice and was told to &quot;get out of Dublin.&quot; Shields agreed with the advice, commenting in January 1991 that &quot;there was no room for us&quot; in Ireland; Ó Cíosóig explained that the Irish music scene was not receptive to their style. Friday provided the band with contacts that secured them a show in Tilburg, Netherlands. The band relocated to the Netherlands after the show and lived there for a further nine months, opening for R.E.M. on one occasion on 8 April 1984. Due to a lack of opportunities and a lack of correct documentation, the band relocated to West Berlin, Germany in late 1984 and recorded their debut mini album, &quot;This Is Your Bloody Valentine&quot; (1985). The album failed to receive much attention and the band returned temporarily to the Netherlands, before settling in London in the middle of 1985.

===1985–1986: Independent releases===
Following their relocation to London in 1985, members of My Bloody Valentine lost contact with each other while looking for accommodation and Tina Durkin, not confident in her abilities as a keyboard player, left the band. When the remaining three members regained contact with one another, the band decided to audition bassists, as they lacked a regular bassist since their formation. Shields acquired Debbie Googe&#x27;s telephone number from a contact in London, invited her to audition and subsequently recruited her as a bassist. Googe managed to attend rehearsals, which were centered around her day job. Rehearsal sessions were regularly held at Salem Studios, which was connected to the independent record label Fever Records. The label&#x27;s management were impressed with the band and agreed to release an extended play, provided the band would finance the recording sessions themselves. Released in December 1985, &quot;Geek!&quot; failed to reach the band&#x27;s expectations; however, soon after its release, My Bloody Valentine were performing on the London gig circuit, alongside bands such as Eight Living Legs, Kill Ugly Pop and The Sting-rays.

Due to the band&#x27;s slow progress, Shields contemplated relocating to New York City, where members of his family were living at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. &quot;The New Record by My Bloody Valentine&quot;, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength of the release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.

===1987: Lazy Records and Butcher&#x27;s recruitment===

In early 1987, My Bloody Valentine signed to Lazy Records, another independent record label, which was founded by the indie pop band the Primitives and their manager, Wayne Morris. My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s first release on the label was the single &quot;Sunny Sundae Smile&quot;, released in February 1987. It peaked at number 6 on the UK Indie Singles Chart and the band toured following its release. After a number of performances throughout the U.K., the band managed to secure a support slot with the Soup Dragons, but on that tour in March 1987, David Conway announced his decision to leave the band, citing a gastric illness, disillusionment with music and ambitions to become a writer.

Conway&#x27;s departure left the band without a lead vocalist, and Shields, Ó Cíosóig and Googe advertised in the local music press for a new singer. The audition process, which Shields described as &quot;disastrous and excruciating,&quot; was unsuccessful because he had mentioned the Smiths in the advertisements &quot;because [he] liked their melodies,&quot; attracting a number of vocalists whom he called &quot;fruitballs.&quot; Although considering forming another group, the band experimented with vocalists Bilinda Butcher and Joe Byfield, both of whom had been recommended to the band by other musicians. Butcher, whose musical experience consisted of playing classical guitar as a child and singing and playing tambourine &quot;with some girlfriends for fun,&quot; had learned that My Bloody Valentine needed a backing vocalist from her partner, who had met Ó Cíosóig on a ferry from the Netherlands. At her audition, she sang &quot;The Bargain Store,&quot; a song from Dolly Parton&#x27;s 1975 album of the same name. She was invited to join the group, with Byfield deemed unsuitable as a lead vocalist.

Following Butcher&#x27;s recruitment, Shields shared lead vocals with her. Commenting on the transition, Shields noted that Butcher &quot;sounded all right and she could sing one of our songs, we just had to show her how to play guitar.&quot; Shields was initially reluctant to take on a vocal role within the band, but said that he had &quot;always sung in the rehearsal room [...] and made up the melodies.&quot; With the new lineup in place, the band intended to drop the My Bloody Valentine moniker, but according to Ó Cíosóig and Shields, the band was unable to decide on a name and kept the moniker &quot;for better or for worse.&quot;

Under pressure from Lazy Records to release a full-length album, the band compromised and agreed to release a single and subsequent mini-album, citing the need for time to stabilize their new lineup. &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot;, a three-track single, was released in November 1987 and &quot;Ecstasy&quot; was released a month later. Both received moderate critical acclaim, and peaked at number 13 and 12 on the independent singles and albums chart, respectively. However, &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot; was described as &quot;certainly the better of the two releases&quot;, as &quot;Ecstasy&quot; was plagued by production difficulties, including errors in the mastering process. &quot;Ecstasy&quot; was criticised as the product of &quot;a group who appeared to have run out of money halfway through recording,&quot; which was later confirmed, as the band were funding the studio sessions themselves. My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s contract with Lazy stated that the label would handle promotion of releases, whereas the band would finance the recording sessions. Following their departure from Lazy, which later rereleased &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot; and &quot;Ecstasy&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Ecstasy and Wine&quot; (1989) without the band&#x27;s consent, Rough Trade Records offered a deal to finance the recording and release of a full-length album, but the band turned it down.

===1988–1991: Creation Records and &quot;Loveless&quot;===

In January 1988, My Bloody Valentine performed in Canterbury, opening for Biff Bang Pow!, a band that featured Creation Records founder Alan McGee. After &quot;blowing [Biff Bang Pow!] off the stage,&quot; My Bloody Valentine were described as &quot;the Irish equivalent to Hüsker Dü&quot; by McGee, who approached the band after the show and invited them to record and release a single on Creation. The band recorded five songs at a studio in Walthamstow, East London in less than a week. In August 1988, they released the &quot;You Made Me Realise&quot; EP, which was received well by the independent music press and, according to AllMusic&#x27;s Nitsuh Abebe, &quot;made critics stand up and take notice of the brilliant things My Bloody Valentine were up to ... it developed some of the stunning guitar sounds that would become the band&#x27;s trademark.&quot; It debuted at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart. Following the success of &quot;You Made Me Realise&quot;, the band released their debut full-length studio album, &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot;, in November 1988. Recorded in rural Wales, the album was a major success, receiving widespread critical acclaim, peaking at number 1 on the UK Indie Chart and influencing a number of &quot;shoegazing&quot; bands, who according to AllMusic, &quot;worked off the template My Bloody Valentine established with [the album].&quot;

In February 1989, My Bloody Valentine began recording their second studio album at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London. Creation Records believed that the album could be recorded &quot;in five days,&quot; but it soon &quot;became clear that wasn&#x27;t going to happen.&quot; Following several unproductive months, during which Shields assumed main duties for the musical and technical aspects of the sessions, the band relocated to a total of 19 other studios and hired a number of engineers, including Alan Moulder, Anjali Dutt and Guy Fixsen. Because of the extensive recording time, Shields and Alan McGee agreed to release another EP, and the band released &quot;Glider&quot; in April 1990. Containing the lead single &quot;Soon&quot;, the EP peaked at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart and the band toured in the summer of 1990 to support its release. In February 1991, while still recording their second album, My Bloody Valentine released &quot;Tremolo&quot;, which was another critical success and topped the UK Indie Chart.

Released in November 1991, &quot;Loveless&quot; was rumoured to have cost more than £250,000 and bankrupted Creation Records, claims that Shields has denied. Critical reception to &quot;Loveless&quot; was nearly unanimous with praise, although the album was not a commercial success; it peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart internationally. McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon after the release of &quot;Loveless&quot; because of the album&#x27;s extensive recording period and his interpersonal problems with Shields. However, &quot;Loveless&quot; proved to have a lasting influence, inspiring bands such as Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins, Mogwai, Nine Inch Nails and more.

===1992–1997: Island Records and breakup===
My Bloody Valentine signed with Island Records in October 1992 for a reported £250,000 contract. The band&#x27;s advance went toward the construction of a home studio in Streatham, South London, which was completed in April 1993. Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into &quot;semi-meltdown,&quot; according to Shields, who was rumoured to have been suffering from writer&#x27;s block. The band remained largely inactive, but they recorded and released two cover songs from 1993 to 1996—a rendering of &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot; by Louis Armstrong for &quot;Peace Together&quot; and a cover of &quot;Map Ref. 41°N 93°W&quot; by Wire for the tribute album &quot;Whore: Tribute to Wire&quot;.

In 1995, Debbie Googe and Colm Ó Cíosóig left My Bloody Valentine. Googe, who briefly worked as a taxi driver following her departure, formed the indie rock supergroup Snowpony with Katharine Gifford, who also performed with Stereolab and Moonshake. Ó Cíosóig relocated to the United States, forming Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions with Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star. Shields and Butcher attempted to record a third studio album that Shields claimed would be released in 1998. Butcher departed the band in 1997. Unable to finalise a third album, Shields isolated himself, and, in his own words, &quot;went crazy,&quot; drawing comparisons in the music press to the eccentric behavior of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd. Shields later became a touring member of Primal Scream, collaborated with a number of artists including Yo La Tengo, Dinosaur Jr. and Le Volume Courbe and recorded songs for the soundtrack to the 2003 film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.

Rumours have spread among fans that albums worth of material had been recorded and shelved prior to the band&#x27;s breakup. In 1999, it was reported that Shields had delivered 60 hours of material to Island Records, and Butcher confirmed that there existed &quot;probably enough songs to fill two albums.&quot; Shields later admitted that at least one full album of &quot;half-finished&quot; material was abandoned, stating &quot;it was dead. It hadn&#x27;t got that spirit, that life in it.&quot;

===2007–2013: Reunion and &quot;m b v&quot;===
In August 2007, reports emerged suggesting that My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. Similar reports had circulated in 2003 stating that Shields, Butcher and Ó Cíosóig were together in Berlin to rerecord five songs originally recorded for &quot;Glider&quot; that would be included in an upcoming box set. In 2007, reports suggested that the band were to perform at a series of Pod-organised concerts at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham, Dublin. Shields later confirmed the reunion and said that the band&#x27;s third studio album, which he had begun recording in 1996, was near completion. Three live shows in the U.K. were announced in November 2007, and on 13 June 2008, My Bloody Valentine performed in public for the first time in 16 years with two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.
My Bloody Valentine embarked upon an extensive worldwide tour throughout summer and autumn 2008. The band performed at European music festivals, including the Roskilde Festival in Roskilde, Denmark, Øyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway and Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Ireland, as well as the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata, Japan. From 19 to 21 September, the band curated and performed at the 2008 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in New York and later performed throughout North America, including dates in Chicago, Toronto, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin. The band spent £200,000 on equipment for their world tour, which was their first since 1992 in support of &quot;Loveless&quot;.

Following additional touring in 2009, My Bloody Valentine dedicated their time to completing their third album. Rumours of a box set, which had circulated in April 2008 following a listing on HMV Japan&#x27;s web site, recirculated. In March 2012, after a number of reported delays, Sony Music Ireland announced the release of the compilation album &quot;EP&#x27;s 1988–1991&quot;—a collection of the band&#x27;s Creation Records extended plays, singles and unreleased tracks. The compilation album was released on 4 May 2012 along with remastered versions of &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot;.
In November 2012, Kevin Shields announced plans to release My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s third album online before the end of the year. In December, the band announced on Facebook that the album was completed and mastered, and on 27 January 2013, during a warmup show at Electric Brixton in London, Shields told the audience that the album &quot;might be out in two or three days.&quot; The album, titled , was released through the band&#x27;s official website on 2 February 2013, and the resulting high traffic crashed the site. Upon its release, received &quot;universal acclaim,&quot; according to Metacritic, and the band went on a worldwide tour.

===2013–present: Future plans===
In 2013, Shields announced plans to release a My Bloody Valentine EP &quot;of all-new material,&quot; which would be followed by a fourth studio album. In September 2017, it was reported that Shields was working on material for a new My Bloody Valentine album that was projected for release in 2018. As of 2018, two EPs were expected to be released in 2019, but all previously announced release estimates have not been met.

In April 2020, American clothing brand Supreme announced a collaboration with My Bloody Valentine, licensing the album art of &quot;Glider&quot;, &quot;Feed Me With Your Kiss&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot; for the company&#x27;s Spring 2020 clothing collection.

On 29 March 2021, My Bloody Valentine published a promotional video which features the cover art of previous releases as well as the text &quot;31 03&quot;. On 31 March 2021, it was announced that My Bloody Valentine signed with Domino Recording Company. The band&#x27;s full discography from 1988 to 2013 was made available on streaming services worldwide for the first time, as well as announcing CD and LP re-releases of their music for 21 May. While promoting My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s re-releases, Shields confirmed that the band is working on new material, and said that they plan on finishing a melodic, song-oriented album and a more experimental album.

In 2022, My Bloody Valentine accused music streaming service Spotify of showing &quot;fake lyrics&quot; which the band called &quot;completely incorrect and insulting&quot;.

On November 25, 2024, the band announced a one-off concert (its first in seven years) to take place on November 22, 2025 at the 3Arena in Dublin.

==Style==
===Influences===
My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s musical style progressed throughout their career. The band were originally influenced by post-punk acts such as The Birthday Party, The Cramps and Joy Division; according to author Mike McGonial the band &quot;brought together the least interesting elements&quot; of their influences. They were also influenced by certain dark post-punk bands who were experimenting: &quot;the best of all was Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure and Killing Joke&quot;. Their debut mini album, &quot;This is Your Bloody Valentine&quot; (1985), incorporated a further gothic rock sound which AllMusic referred to as &quot;unfocused and derivative&quot;. However, when the band began experimenting with pop melodies on &quot;The New Record by My Bloody Valentine&quot; (1986), it marked &quot;a vital point in the development of their sound&quot;, which was influenced primarily by The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band later took a &quot;rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock&quot; with their two successive releases, &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot; and &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1987). &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; and its preceding releases were influenced by American bands, most notably the distorted guitar-based noise rock of Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth, as well as the experimental dream pop of British group A.R. Kane, during which time Shields developed his trademark guitar techniques.

The band were further influenced by dance music and especially hip hop, of which Shields said &quot;it beats the shit out of most rock music when it comes to being experimental, it&#x27;s been a constant source of inspiration to us.&quot; Shield&#x27;s experimentation with guitar tone would be influenced by sampled sounds employed by Public Enemy and the Bomb Squad, which Shields described as &quot;half-buried or muted, a real sense of sounds being semi-decayed, or destroyed, but then re-used.&quot; The band experimented with samplers around the time of the &quot;Glider EP&quot;, utilizing them to play back and manipulate their own guitar feedback and vocals on keyboards; by the time of the &quot;Tremolo EP&quot;, they had acquired an Akai sampler. In the mid-1990s, Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig recorded music influenced by the rapid rhythms of the UK&#x27;s underground jungle and drum and bass scenes.

===Sound===

One of the most recognisable aspects of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s music is Shields&#x27; electric guitar sound, which &quot;use[s] texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes.&quot; During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, to allow him to manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved &quot;a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus&quot;, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Shields&#x27; most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from an Alesis Midiverb II or Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as &quot;glide guitar&quot;. Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large number of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, in the closing song &quot;You Made Me Realise&quot;, My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise, which can last for half an hour and often reaches 130 dB. Shields later remarked &quot;it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We just liked the fact that we could see a change in the audience at a certain point.&quot;

Bilinda Butcher&#x27;s vocals have been referred to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s sound, alongside Shields&#x27; guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot;, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said &quot;influenced [her] sound&quot; by making them &quot;more dreamy and sleepy&quot;. The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described the band&#x27;s vocals as androgynous.

===Lyrical themes===
My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band&#x27;s lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are &quot;a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness&quot;. Butcher herself has referred to a lot of the lyrics as &quot;plain nonsense.&quot; According to Butcher, she &quot;didn&#x27;t have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment.&quot; Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: &quot;He [Shields] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words.&quot; Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted. Of this, Shields spoke:
Words are extremely important in the sense that we&#x27;ve spent way more time on the lyrics than ever on the music. Music is spontaneous and it&#x27;s either good or bad so you just take it or leave it. Where lyrics, all the stuff comes out and then we usually just finish them right before we have to sing so it&#x27;s usually these nights of eight or ten hours just trying to desperately make sure it&#x27;s going to be as good as possible, even though most of it&#x27;s there anyway and it&#x27;s always been there. There&#x27;s nothing worse than bad lyrics. For me a bad lyric is a lyric that jumps out at you, and that&#x27;s offensive, it takes you completely away from enjoying the music.

==Legacy==
My Bloody Valentine are regarded by some as the pioneers of the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegaze, a term coined by &quot;Sounds&quot; journalists in the 1990s to describe certain bands&#x27; &quot;motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor&quot;. The band&#x27;s releases on Creation Records influenced shoegaze acts, including Slowdive, Ride and Lush, and are regarded as providing a platform to allow the bands to become recognised. Following the release of &quot;Loveless&quot; (1991), My Bloody Valentine were &quot;poised for a popular breakthrough&quot;, although never achieved mainstream success. However, the band are noted to have been &quot;profoundly influential in the direction of &#x27;90s alternative rock&quot;, according to AllMusic. In 2017, a study of AllMusic&#x27;s database indicated My Bloody Valentine as its 26th most frequently cited influence on other artists.

Several alternative rock bands have cited My Bloody Valentine as an influence. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan was influenced by &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; upon its release and attempted to recreate its sound on the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Gish&quot; (1991), particularly the closing track &quot;Daydream&quot; which Corgan described as &quot;a complete rip-off of the My Bloody Valentine sound.&quot; The Smashing Pumpkins two successive studio albums, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; (1993) and &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; (1995), were also influenced by the band. Courtney Love cited the band as an influence on Hole&#x27;s third album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (1998).

Other bands and artists that have cited My Bloody Valentine as an influence include American Football, Veruca Salt, Mogwai, Oneohtrix Point Never, Thursday, Naked Giants, and Quicksand.

Actor Michael Imperioli of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; fame has cited My Bloody Valentine as one of his favorite bands, and described seeing them live as &quot;a very profound experience, very physical and very visceral&quot;.

<text>Aer Lingus ( ; an anglicisation of the Irish , meaning &quot;air fleet&quot;) is the flag carrier of Ireland. Founded by the Irish Government, it was privatised between 2006 and 2015, and it is now a wholly owned subsidiary of International Airlines Group (IAG). The airline&#x27;s head office is on the grounds of Dublin Airport in Cloghran, County Dublin.

Formed in 1936, Aer Lingus is a former member of the Oneworld airline alliance, which it left on 31 March 2007. After the takeover by IAG, it was expected that Aer Lingus would re-enter Oneworld, however, at a press briefing on 15 November 2017 the airline&#x27;s then CEO Stephen Kavanagh stated that the airline has &quot;no plans to join Oneworld&quot;. The airline has codeshares with Oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam members, as well as interline agreements with Etihad Airways, JetBlue Airways and United Airlines. Aer Lingus has a hybrid business model of low-cost and traditional carriers, operating a mixed fare service on its European routes and full service, two-class flights on transatlantic routes.

Ryanair owned over 29% of Aer Lingus stock and the Irish state owned over 25% before being bought out by IAG in 2015. The state had previously held an 85% shareholding until the Government&#x27;s decision to float the company on the Dublin and London stock exchanges on 2 October 2006. The principal group companies include Aer Lingus Limited, Aer Lingus Beachey Limited, Aer Lingus (Ireland) Limited and Dirnan Insurance Company Limited, all of which are wholly owned.

On 26 May 2015, after months of negotiations on a possible IAG takeover, the Irish government agreed to sell its 25% stake in the company. Ryanair retained a 30% stake in Aer Lingus which it agreed to sell to IAG on 10 July 2015 for €2.55 per share. In August 2015, Aer Lingus&#x27; shareholders officially accepted IAG&#x27;s takeover offer. IAG subsequently assumed control of Aer Lingus on 2 September 2015.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Aer Lingus was founded on 15 April 1936, with a capital of £100,000. Its first chairman was Seán Ó hUadhaigh. Pending legislation for Government investment through a parent company, Aer Lingus was associated with Blackpool and West Coast Air Services which advanced the money for the first aircraft, and operated with Aer Lingus under the common title &quot;Irish Sea Airways&quot;. Aer Lingus Teoranta was registered as an airline on 22 May 1936. The name &quot;Aer Lingus&quot; was proposed by Richard F O&#x27;Connor, who was County Cork Surveyor, as well as an aviation enthusiast.
On 27 May 1936, five days after being registered as an airline, its first service began between Baldonnel Airfield in Clondalkin, Dublin and Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport, the United Kingdom, using a six-seater de Havilland DH.84 Dragon biplane (registration EI-ABI), named &quot;Iolar&quot; (Eagle).

Later that year, the airline acquired its second aircraft, a four-engined biplane de Havilland DH.86 Express named &quot;Éire&quot;, with a capacity of 14 passengers. This aircraft provided the first air link between Dublin and London by extending the Bristol service to Croydon. At the same time, the DH.84 Dragon was used to inaugurate an Aer Lingus service on the Dublin-Liverpool route.

The airline was established as the national carrier under the Air Navigation and Transport Act (1936). In 1937, the Irish government created Aer Rianta (now called Dublin Airport Authority), a company to assume financial responsibility for the new airline and the entire country&#x27;s civil aviation infrastructure. In April 1937, Aer Lingus became wholly owned by the Irish government via Aer Rianta.

The airline&#x27;s first General Manager was Dr J.F. (Jeremiah known as &#x27;Jerry&#x27;) Dempsey, a chartered accountant, who joined the company on secondment from Kennedy Crowley &amp; Co (predecessor to KPMG) as Company Secretary in 1936 (aged 30) and was appointed to the role of General Manager in 1937. He retired 30 years later in 1967 at the age of 60.

In 1938, a de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide replaced &quot;Iolar&quot;, and the company purchased a second DH.86B. Two Lockheed 14s arrived in 1939, Aer Lingus&#x27; first all-metal aircraft.
In January 1940, a new airport opened in the Dublin suburb of Collinstown and Aer Lingus moved its operations there. It purchased a new DC-3 and inaugurated new services to Liverpool and an internal service to Shannon. The airline&#x27;s services were curtailed during World War II with the sole route being to Liverpool or Barton Aerodrome Manchester depending on the fluctuating security situation.

=== Post-war expansion ===
On 9 November 1945, regular services were resumed with an inaugural flight to London. From this point Aer Lingus aircraft, initially mostly Douglas DC-3s, were painted in a silver and green livery. The airline introduced its first flight attendants.

In 1946, a new Anglo-Irish agreement gave Aer Lingus exclusive UK traffic rights from Ireland in exchange for a 40% holding by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA). Because of Aer Lingus&#x27; growth the airline bought seven new Vickers Viking aircraft in 1947, however, these proved to be uneconomical and were soon sold.
In 1947, Aerlínte Éireann came into existence to operate transatlantic flights to New York City from Ireland. The airline ordered five new Lockheed L-749 Constellations, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. John A Costello, the incoming Fine Gael Taoiseach (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from a small country like Ireland.
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus introduced routes to Brussels, Amsterdam via Manchester and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure, the airline became one of the early purchasers of Vickers Viscount 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954. In 1952, the airline expanded its all-freight services and acquired a small fleet of Bristol 170 Freighters, which remained in service until 1957.

Prof. Patrick Lynch was appointed the chairman of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in 1954 and served in the position until 1975. In 1956, Aer Lingus introduced a new, green-top livery with a white lightning flash down the windows and the Irish flag displayed on the fin.

=== First transatlantic service ===
On 28 April 1958, Aerlínte Éireann operated its first transatlantic service from Shannon to New York. In 1960, Aerlínte Éireann was renamed Aer Lingus.

Aer Lingus bought seven Fokker F27 Friendships, which were delivered between November 1958 and May 1959. These were used in short-haul services to the UK, gradually replacing the Dakotas, until Aer Lingus replaced them in 1966 with secondhand Viscount 800s.

The airline entered the jet age on 14 December 1960 when it received three Boeing 720 for use on the New York route and the newest Aer Lingus destination Boston.

In 1963, Aer Lingus added Aviation Traders Carvairs to the fleet. These aircraft could transport five cars which were loaded into the fuselage through the nose of the aircraft. The Carvair proved to be uneconomical for the airline partly due to the rise of auto ferry services, and the aircraft were used for freight services until disposed of.

The Boeing 720s proved to be a success for the airline on the transatlantic routes. To supplement these, Aer Lingus took delivery of its first larger Boeing 707 in 1964, and the type continued to serve the airline until 1986.

=== Jet aircraft ===
Conversion of the European fleet to jet equipment began in 1965 when the BAC One-Eleven started services on continental Europe. The airline adopted a new livery in the same year, with a large green shamrock on the fin. In 1966, the remainder of the company&#x27;s shares held by Aer Rianta were transferred to the Minister for Finance.
In 1966, the company added routes to Montreal and Chicago. In 1968, flights from Belfast, in Northern Ireland, to New York City started, however, it was soon suspended due to the beginning of the Troubles. Aer Lingus introduced Boeing 737s to its fleet in 1969 to cope with the high demand for flights between Dublin and London. Later, Aer Lingus extended the 737 flights to all of its European networks.

In 1967, after 30 years of service, General Manager Dr J.F. Dempsey signed the contract for the airline&#x27;s first two Boeing 747 aircraft before he retired later that year.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===

On 6 March 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of the first of two Boeing 747s for use on the transatlantic routes. The company later purchased a third for its fleet but quickly offered it for lease because it was not initially profitable for the company to fly 747s across the Atlantic. In 1974, Aer Lingus unveiled a new livery which eliminated the word &quot;International&quot; and/or &quot;Irish&quot; from the fuselage titles. The livery included a dark green cheatline, light green upper surfaces and tail, split by a thinner blue line, plus a large white shamrock on the tail fin.

In 1977, Aer Lingus recruited its first female pilot, Gráinne Cronin – the airline was the second in Europe (after SAS) to introduce female pilots.

In September 1979, Aer Lingus became the first European airline other than Alitalia to be used by Pope John Paul II, when he flew aboard a specially modified Boeing 747 (EI-ASI or St. Patrick) from Rome to Dublin and later from Shannon to Boston. In the early 1980s, the 707s were phased out.
In 1984, the airline formed a fully owned subsidiary, Aer Lingus Commuter, so that Aer Lingus could fly to larger cities in Ireland and Britain whose flying time from Dublin did not require jet aircraft. These services employed five of the Belfast-built Short 360 after conducting a trial with the Short 330. Around this time Aer Lingus purchased a majority shareholding in the cargo airline Aer Turas, owner of some DC-8 freighter jets.

Between 1987 and 1989, new Boeing 737s arrived to replace the older ones, and six Fokker 50s were added to the &quot;Commuter&quot; fleet. During 1990, after the passage of the deregulation act for the airline industry in Ireland, Aer Lingus reconsidered its operational policies. It retired the BAC One-Elevens and replaced them with five new 737s. In 1991, four Saab 340Bs arrived at the commuter division to replace the Short 360 aircraft. By 1992, Aer Lingus&#x27;s entire original 737-200 fleet had been replaced and it was now the first carrier in the world operating all three versions of the second-generation 737. These were the −300, −400 and −500 series, although the −300 did not stay long in Aer Lingus service.

In 1994, Aer Lingus started direct services between Dublin and the United States using the Airbus A330 and in May of that year, Aer Lingus operated the first A330-300 ETOPS service over the North Atlantic. This led to the phasing out of the Boeing 747 and the briefly operated Boeing 767-300ER. On 2 October 1995, the Boeing 747 service ceased operations after twenty-five years of service. By that time, over eight million people had travelled across the Atlantic in Aer Lingus Boeing 747s. The late 1990s saw Aer Lingus return to Belfast with service to New York via Shannon. It also added Newark Liberty International Airport as a destination, but discontinued these flights in 2001.

The first Airbus short-haul aircraft arrived in 1998 in the form of the A321, initially to mainly operate the Dublin-Heathrow route. Six were delivered in 1998 and 1999 and three of these continue in service today. The first A320 was delivered in 2000, with three more added to the fleet by 2001.

=== 2000s to 2010s ===
On 1 February 2001, Aer Lingus Commuter merged back into the mainline operation. The business was severely affected by the 9/11 attacks in the United States. In response, the airline cut staff numbers and destinations and reduced its fleet. As a result, it weathered the storm and returned to profit, largely through lowering the airline&#x27;s cost base, updating the fleet with modern Airbus equipment and developing new routes to mainland European destinations. Aer Lingus had previously largely neglected mainland Europe in favour of US and British destinations. It positioned itself as competition to the European no-frills airlines while offering intercontinental flights, phased-out Business class travel for short-haul flights, but retained cargo services on a small number of routes.

A large order for A320 aircraft saw deliveries commencing in 2004 and continuing to 2011. The delivery of these aircraft allowed the withdrawal of the Boeing 737. On 29 October 2005, Aer Lingus withdrew its last two 737 aircraft from service, marking the end of Boeing aircraft at Aer Lingus, and the beginning of an all-Airbus fleet.

On 27 October 2005, Aer Lingus announced its first scheduled service to Asia from March 2006 as Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, where Chief Executive Dermot Mannion was based when at Emirates. Despite the Aer Lingus press release describing it as the first long-haul service outside the United States, there had in fact been a previous service to Montreal from 1966 to 1979. The great circle distance of is comparable to the service to Chicago. At the same time, Mannion linked the funding of new long-haul aircraft to replace the A330 fleet with the privatisation of the airline. The Dubai service ceased in March 2008 as the airline sought to increase its market share in the newly liberalised transatlantic market.

On 6 June 2007, Aer Lingus strengthened its relationship with the European manufacturer by ordering six of the new A350-900 and six A330-300. These were used to expand long-haul operations as well as replace three older models. Deliveries of the A330 began in February 2009. In 2011, Aer Lingus switched their remaining three A330 orders to A350-900s, with delivery no sooner than 2017. The A350 orders were subsequently assumed by IAG in 2015.

==== Flotation ====

In preparation for the commercial flotation of Aer Lingus on the Dublin stock market, the Irish government agreed to abolish the Shannon Stopover from the end of 2006 in stages.

The company began conditional (or &quot;grey-market&quot;) share dealings on 27 September 2006 and was formally admitted to the Official Lists of the Irish Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange on 2 October 2006. At the time of the flotation, the Irish government maintained a 28% shareholding, while employees held 15%. The stock IPO offer price was €2.20.

Aer Lingus withdrew from the Oneworld airline alliance on 31 March 2007, instead, entering into bilateral agreements with airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Delta Air Lines, KLM, and United Airlines. Aer Lingus explained the move stating the carrier was repositioning as a low-cost carrier, which did not fit with Oneworld&#x27;s pitch to the premium international frequent flyer.

On 6 February 2007, however, the airline announced its intention to form a new alliance with JetBlue. This new alliance was to act as a weblink between the two airlines, enabling Aer Lingus customers to book JetBlue destinations from the Aer Lingus website. In 2008, it also announced an alliance with United Airlines for connecting services within the US.

With the flotation of Aer Lingus on the stock exchange, Aer Lingus had planned to expand its route network, but this was put on hold due to the economic situation.

==== First Ryanair takeover bid (2006) ====
On 5 October 2006, Ryanair launched a bid to buy Aer Lingus. Ryanair CEO Michael O&#x27;Leary said the move was a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to form an Irish airline. The &quot;new&quot; airline would carry over 50 million passengers a year. Ryanair said it had bought a 16% stake in Aer Lingus and was offering €2.80 for the remaining shares, a premium over the €2.20 the shares were trading for. The firm was trading at €1.13bn but Ryanair&#x27;s offer valued it at €1.48bn. On the same day Aer Lingus rejected Ryanair&#x27;s takeover bid. On 5 October 2006, Ryanair confirmed it had raised its stake to 19.2%, and said it had no problem in the Irish Government keeping its 28.3%. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that the Government would possibly seek judgement from the courts, and referral to competition authorities in Dublin – although this would be automatic under European regulation, as the combined group would control 78% of the Dublin – London passenger air traffic.

On 29 November 2006, Ryanair confirmed it had taken its stake to 26.2%.

On 21 December 2006, Ryanair announced it was withdrawing its bid for Aer Lingus, with the intent of pursuing another bid soon after the European Commission finishes investigating the bid. The EC has been concerned that the takeover would reduce consumer choice and increase fares.

On 27 June 2007, the European Commission announced its decision to block the bid on competition grounds saying the two airlines controlled more than 80% of all European flights to and from Dublin Airport.

==== Cross border expansion ====
On 7 August 2007, the airline announced that it would establish its first base outside the Republic of Ireland at Belfast International Airport in Northern Ireland. Services from Belfast International commenced in December 2007. , the airline had three Airbus A320 aircraft based at the airport, serving eleven European destinations. Significantly, this move restored the Belfast International to London Heathrow Airport link and Aer Lingus cooperated with its codeshare partner British Airways on this route to connect with BA&#x27;s network at Heathrow. To do so, the airline discontinued its Shannon-Heathrow service, a move that generated political controversy in the west of Ireland, particularly as the Shannon-London route was still profitable. The airline predicted that this move would add one million additional passengers annually. The Shannon to Heathrow service has since been reinstated.

After five years at Belfast International Airport, Aer Lingus announced on 19 July 2012 that it would be moving its operations to George Best Belfast City Airport. The airline transferred its Belfast – London Heathrow flights to there, and also announced the operation of a thrice-daily London Gatwick service (no longer operated), and on 31 March 2013, launched services to Faro and Málaga. Aer Lingus based two aircraft in Belfast City Airport for the Winter 2012–2013 season and a third aircraft arrived for the Summer 2013 season.

==== Open Skies ====
On 22 March 2007, as a result of the EU–US Open Skies Agreement, Aer Lingus announced three new long-haul services to the United States. From Autumn 2007, Aer Lingus commenced direct flights to Orlando, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.-Dulles, facilitated by the arrival of two new Airbus A330 aircraft in May 2007. The airline also serves Boston (Logan International Airport), Chicago (O&#x27;Hare International Airport), and New York (JFK Airport). Aer Lingus ended its Middle-Eastern Route to Dubai in March 2008 and ended its Los Angeles route in November 2008. The Washington D.C. and the San Francisco routes were discontinued . Services from Washington, D.C., resumed on 28 March 2010 when the airline began flights from Washington, D.C., to Madrid, Spain in a joint venture with United Airlines. The airline terminated this route on 30 October 2012. Service to San Francisco resumed on 2 April 2014. Dublin–Washington Dulles service began in May 2015. The Dublin–Los Angeles route was reintroduced on 4 May 2016. Other US destinations include Hartford, introduced on 28 September 2016; Seattle, introduced on 18 May 2018; Minneapolis-St Paul, introduced on 1 July 2019.

==== Effect of 2008 recession ====
After reporting losses of €22 million for the first half of the year, in October 2008, Aer Lingus announced a €74 million cost-saving plan. This plan included cutting up to 1,500 jobs, scaled back ground operations at Cork airport, and outsourced all ground staff at Dublin airport. This met with a largely negative response particularly from trade unions.

In December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that the Shannon – Heathrow service would resume from 29 March 2009 following new arrangements with the trade unions on staff costs and the Shannon Airport Authority on airport charges. However at the end of June 2009 the company had accumulated losses of €93 million and Chairman Colm Barrington confirmed this situation could not continue. In October 2009, newly appointed Chief Executive Christoph Mueller announced a radical cost-cutting plan that would lead to the loss of 676 jobs at the company and see pay and pension reductions for those being retained. The total plan aimed to achieve savings of €97 million between then and 2011. As a six-week consultation process began, Mueller refused to rule out further cuts in the future.

==== Second Ryanair takeover bid (2008/2009) ====

On 1 December 2008, Ryanair launched a second takeover bid of Aer Lingus, making an all-cash offer of €748 million (£619mil; US$950mil). The €1.40 offer was a 28% premium on the average closing price of Aer Lingus stock during the 30 days to 28 November 28 (€1.09), but half what Ryanair had offered in 2006. Ryanair said, &quot;Aer Lingus, as a small, stand-alone, regional airline has been marginalised and bypassed as most other EU flag carriers consolidate.&quot; The two airlines would operate separately and Ryanair claimed that it would double the Aer Lingus short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 and create 1,000 new jobs. The Aer Lingus Board rejected the offer and advised its shareholders to take no action. The offer was eventually rejected by a majority of the other shareholders. It was the second failed attempt by Michael O&#x27;Leary to take over the national flag carrier. Ryanair initially left the offer open to Aer Lingus until it withdrew the bid on 28 January 2009. The Irish Government slammed O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s offer as &quot;undervaluing the airline&quot; and stated that a Ryanair takeover would have a &quot;significant negative impact&quot; on competition in the industry and on the Irish consumer. Ryanair repeatedly stated that another bid was unlikely, but it kept a stake in Aer Lingus, prompting an investigation by competition regulators in the UK.

In June 2009, Aer Lingus re-branded its &quot;Premier Class&quot; to the new &quot;Business Class&quot;.

==== Gatwick base ====
On 19 December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that it would open a base at Gatwick Airport. Four aircraft were based there beginning April 2009, serving eight destinations that included Dublin, Faro, Knock, Málaga, Munich, Nice, Vienna and Zürich. CEO Dermot Mannion also said the company expects to increase the number of aircraft based at Gatwick to eight within 12 months.

, the airline based an additional A320 aircraft at Gatwick, bringing the total number to five and making Gatwick its biggest base outside Ireland. This resulted in six new routes to Bucharest, Eindhoven, Lanzarote, Tenerife, Vilnius and Warsaw which commenced in late October 2009. The Gatwick to Nice route was suspended for the winter months.

On 8 January 2010, due to the weak demand in air travel, Aer Lingus announced that it was to reduce the number of aircraft based at Gatwick from five to three. The three remaining aircraft were to operate the carrier&#x27;s services to Dublin, Knock and Málaga as well as a new route to Cork.

In January 2011, Aer Lingus announced a new daily service from Gatwick to Shannon starting at the end of March. The service has since been suspended. The service to Málaga was suspended in January 2012 and the base closed in 2015. The Gatwick to Cork route ended 27 October 2012. A new service from Gatwick to Belfast City Airport started on 28 October, operating three times per day, and follows the airline&#x27;s move from Belfast-International Airport to Belfast City Airport. That service was suspended on 27 April 2016.

==== Appointment of Christoph Mueller as CEO ====
On 6 April 2009, CEO Dermot Mannion announced his resignation from the airline after four years as Chief Executive. He was replaced by German-born Christoph Müller (alternative spelling &quot;Mueller&quot;), former head of TUI Travel and Sabena, who joined Aer Lingus on 1 October 2009.

On 2 December 2009, Aer Lingus announced that talks with its unions had broken down. As a result, the board voted to reduce capacity, and with it associated jobs, as a response. According to Mueller, concessions offered by unions were of a short-term nature, and the airline was asked for high compensation in return. Aer Lingus did not identify the routes or jobs to be cut, but they would most likely &quot;commence immediately and will be compulsory,&quot; according to Mueller.
 all employees&#x27; groups had passed votes on the acceptance of the &#x27;Greenfield&#x27; cost-cutting plans which were expected to save €57M annually. Once implemented the second phase of cost-cutting was to commence which aimed to save €40M annually by reducing &#x27;back office staff&#x27; numbers by up to 40% according to the CEO.

Mueller indicated that Aer Lingus intended to reposition itself again, moving away from head-to-head competition with Ryanair in the low-cost sector to a more hybrid model with a stronger emphasis on service. As part of this move, Aer Lingus entered talks to join an airline alliance again, having left Oneworld in 2007.

Aer Lingus announced on 15 June 2010 that it would suspend services from Shannon to Boston and New York (JFK) for 11 weeks beginning January 2011.

==== 75th anniversary ====
Aer Lingus celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011. On 26 March, the company presented its latest aircraft which has been painted in the 1960s livery and the crew was wearing a selection of historical uniforms.

==== Third Ryanair takeover bid (2012) ====
On 19 June 2012, Ryanair announced its intention to launch another bid to take over Aer Lingus, at €1.30 per share, for a total of €694 million. Ryanair expressed the hope that the competition authorities would not block this attempt, pointing to the recent takeovers of bmi and Brussels Airlines by International Airlines Group (IAG) (parent company of Iberia and British Airways) and Lufthansa, respectively.
On 20 June 2012, Aer Lingus issued a press release stating that having reviewed Ryanair&#x27;s proposed offer, the company board rejected it and advised the company&#x27;s shareholders not to take any action concerning it. The statement pointed out that any offer from Ryanair was unlikely to be capable of completion due to, firstly, the EU Commission&#x27;s 2007 decision to block the airline&#x27;s bid for Aer Lingus at the time, and, secondly, the UK Competition Commission&#x27;s ongoing investigation of Ryanair&#x27;s minority stake in Aer Lingus. Furthermore, the press release stated that the Aer Lingus board believed that Ryanair&#x27;s offer undervalued Aer Lingus, considering the airline&#x27;s profitability and balance sheet, including cash reserves over €1 billion ().

On 27 February 2013, the European Commission blocked the third attempt by Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus, stating that the merger would have damaged consumers&#x27; choice and resulted in increased fares.

==== Virgin Atlantic wet-lease agreement ====

In December 2012, following the acquisition of British Midland International by British Airways, Virgin Atlantic was awarded slots to fly domestic routes in the UK from Heathrow Airport, ending the monopoly on these services that BA had held since its successful takeover. Aer Lingus supplied on a wet lease agreement four Airbus A320-214 aircraft (painted in Virgin&#x27;s colours but under Irish registration) as well as crew for these services, which operated from London Heathrow to Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Manchester. Services began on 31 March 2013 to Manchester. This wet-lease agreement ended in September 2015, as Virgin Atlantic cancelled its domestic services.

==== Long-haul expansion ====
In July 2013, expansion into North America was announced launching in 2014; including a direct service from Dublin to San Francisco five times weekly and a daily service from Dublin to Toronto to be operated by Air Contractors with Boeing 757s on behalf of the airline. It was also announced that transatlantic services from Shannon to Boston and New York would operate daily all year round from January 2014 to Boston and from March 2014 to New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport; however, the airline would lease Boeing 757 aircraft from Air Contractors to operate these routes, rather than using its Airbus A330 aircraft as it had done before. In addition, Aer Lingus service to Washington Dulles airport resumed 1 May 2015, with four flights weekly, and flights to Los Angeles, Newark, Miami, Philadelphia, and Seattle all started between 2015 and 2018. Flights from Dublin to Minneapolis operated from 2019 until being suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic; they were scheduled to resume 29 April 2024.

On 24 March 2021, Aer Lingus announced the launch of four new routes from Manchester Airport; New York John F Kennedy and Orlando from 29 July 2021, Barbados from 20 October 2021 and Boston from summer 2022.

==== Change of CEO ====
On 18 July 2014, Aer Lingus said it had &quot;been agreed&quot; between the company and Mueller that he would step down as CEO and director in May 2015. Mueller left to join Malaysia Airlines as part of its restructuring exercise. On 16 February 2015 the company announced that the new CEO and director would be Stephen Kavanagh, beginning 1 March 2015. As of 1 January 2019, Sean Doyle became the new Aer Lingus CEO. As of 6 April 2021 Lynne Embleton became the new Aer Lingus CEO.

==== IAG takeover (2014/2015) ====
On 14 December 2014, International Airlines Group (IAG), owner of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, launched a €1 billion takeover-bid (€2.30 per-share) for Aer Lingus Group plc. The Aer Lingus Board rejected the offer on 16 December 2014, with Aer Lingus commenting that the offer was, &quot;preliminary, highly conditional and non-binding&quot;. It was further noted: &quot;The board has reviewed the proposal and believes that it fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and its attractive prospects. Accordingly, the proposal was rejected&quot;.

On 9 January 2015, Aer Lingus rejected a second bid from IAG, proposing a €2.40 per-share takeover. On 24 January 2015, IAG launched a third bid for Aer Lingus, proposing a €2.55 per-share takeover offer, totalling close to €1.4 billion. On 27 January 2015, Aer Lingus&#x27;s board announced that &quot;the financial terms of IAG&#x27;s third proposal for the airline are at a level it is willing to recommend&quot;, Aer Lingus said it noted, &quot;IAG&#x27;s intentions regarding the future of the company, in particular, that Aer Lingus would operate as a separate business with its own brand, management and operations&quot;.

On 26 May 2015, the Irish Government agreed to the sale of its 25% shareholding to IAG, with a takeover now dependent on Ryanair&#x27;s position on the matter. On 10 July 2015, Ryanair voted to sell its nearly 30% stake in the airline. The takeover was later approved by the EU and US regulators subject to IAG giving up five slot pairs at London Gatwick Airport. On 2 September 2015, IAG assumed control of Aer Lingus. On 17 September 2015, following completion of the acquisition by IAG, the company&#x27;s shares were withdrawn from the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.

=== 2020s ===

On 25 February 2020, Aer Lingus noted it had been advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs that travel restrictions were being placed on several Italian towns within Italy&#x27;s Lombardy region as a result of an outbreak of COVID-19 there, however stated all flights would continue to operate, further advising all flights operated would continue to comply with guidelines locally from the HSE as well as from the WHO and EASA.

On 28 February, Aer Lingus had been informed that a passenger had travelled with COVID-19 on a service from Milan-Linate to Dublin and that it was cooperating fully with the HSE and Department for Foreign Affairs. Four Aer Lingus cabin crew were also placed into self-isolation from the flight in question. The following day, Aer Lingus announced flight suspensions to Northern Italy, subsequently extending this on 10 March to all services to Italy.

On 13 March, Donald Trump, then President of the United States, announced a European travel ban which initially exempted Ireland, however this was extended to cover Ireland the following day. Aer Lingus subsequently announced network-wide reductions which eventually saw its network of flights reduced by 95%, the airlines plan for its biggest summer schedule within its history was scuppered as a result of what became a global pandemic. In a temporary measure, the airline confirmed it was cutting hours and salaries for all employees by 50%.

Later that month on 29 March, Aer Lingus flight EI9019 from Beijing, China touched down at Dublin Airport carrying vital PPE for Ireland&#x27;s health service workers, it marked the start of hundreds of flights the carrier was expected to operate to/from China on request of the Government.

With just 5% of scheduled flights operating, it was announced on 1 May 2020 that Aer Lingus was seeking 900 job cuts. The airline subsequently entered into talks with trade unions about changes to work practices and proposed job cuts, Aer Lingus CEO Sean Doyle commented that it would take years for the aviation industry to recover. Aer Lingus later confirmed it was seeking further temporary pay cuts and changes to work practices in a cost saving exercise, advising that its 2021 schedule would be at least 20% lower than planned. Job cuts were confirmed later that month, those holding temporary contracts were made redundant and cabin crew based in Shannon were informed that they would be temporarily laid off as the airline was not operating services from there.

On 13 June, media reporting indicated broad acceptance of proposed measures based on a final draft document between Aer Lingus and Trade Unions, however the following day the union Fórsa representing over 1,400 Aer Lingus cabin crew advised of its intention to ballot members. The airline stated on 15 June, that if acceptance was not agreed by 6pm that evening, it would withdraw its offer and implement them unilaterally with a 70% cut to employees&#x27; wages excluding pilots. As the deadline passed the airline initiated the action to implement the changes angering Trade Unions representing the majority of Aer Lingus employees. On 17 June, the airline agreed to allow a ballot for up to two weeks for its pilots for changes to work practices and recovery of salaries.

In June 2021, the airline said it wanted to freeze workers&#x27; pay for five years while it is proposing sharp cuts in rates paid to new cabin and crew staff.

In 2024, IAG announced that Aer Lingus will no longer be the worldwide launch operator of the Airbus A321XLR as originally planned. Due to ongoing labour disputes, the first aircraft will be relocated to sister company Iberia instead.

On 23 October 2024, it was reported that Aer Lingus will be introducing a new non-stop direct route between Dublin and Indianapolis, beginning 3 May 2025. The route is seen as a major milestone for the airline as currently there is no direct non-stop flights to the capital city of Indiana. Aer Lingus will be offering four flights per week using its Airbus A321XLR aircraft.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Business trends ===
Key trends for Aer Lingus are (as at year ending 31 December):

=== Ownership and structure ===
Aer Lingus was listed on the Irish and London Stock Exchanges, under ticker EIL1 on the Irish Stock Exchange and ticker AERL on the London Stock Exchange. However it was delisted on 17 September 2015 following its majority acquisition by IAG. Shareholdings () are:

==== Aer Lingus Cargo ====
Aer Lingus Cargo is the airline&#x27;s cargo division. It uses reserved areas of passenger aircraft cargo-holds. Aer Lingus Cargo is available on all routes to the US from Dublin and Shannon. Cargo services are also offered on most European routes and some routes to the UK, the division subsequently rebranded as IAG Cargo.

==== Aer Lingus Regional ====
Aer Lingus Regional flights have been operated by Emerald Airlines on a franchise basis since 17 March 2022.

Aer Lingus had a franchise agreement with Irish regional airline Stobart Air (formerly Aer Arann), under which Stobart Air operated several routes under the Aer Lingus Regional brand, livery and flight code. Stobart Air had not operated any flights under its own RE code since April 2012, and all its routes were transferred to Aer Lingus with flight numbers in the EI3XXX range. Stobart Air was placed into liquidation in June 2021; Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer stepped in to operate the routes on a temporary basis.

=== Business model ===
Aer Lingus adopted a &quot;small frills&quot; strategic approach – a hybrid between a traditional legacy airline and a low-cost carrier. The difference lies in the services offered on short-haul and long-haul flights with meals offered free on the latter only.

The new strategy required considerable negotiation with the unions, and a consensus was reached that lower costs and a reinvention of the airline were necessary for its survival. The union concessions that arose from the negotiations were detrimental to the airline&#x27;s image however; by 2003 the wage freeze had been lifted and there were 3,800 voluntary redundancies with no forced layoffs. These factors contributed to the airline&#x27;s reported profits in 2002, 2003 and 2005, with only a small loss recorded in 2004.

=== Head office ===


The Aer Lingus head office is located on the grounds of Dublin Airport in Fingal, County Dublin. Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) renovated an existing building to create Aer Lingus&#x27;s headquarters.

The HOB Site, the former head office site includes the former head office building, the services annexe, the Iolar House, the Mock-Up Building, the ALSAA swimming pool, and various smaller structures and buildings. The Head Office Building housed the corporate head office of Aer Lingus and its subsidiaries, and many administrative functions, employees, and car parking spaces, were located in this building. The Iolar House and Mock-Up Building housed training facilities for Aer Lingus crew and office space. This former head office is proximate to the former Ryanair head office. Brian Lavery of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 2004 that the proximity, described by Lavery as &quot;a few parking lots away,&quot; was &quot;a symbol of just how close the competition is to home.&quot; In 2010, Aer Lingus announced that it surrendered the lease on its head office building to the Dublin Airport Authority and that it would move its employees to Hangar 6 and other buildings in the airline&#x27;s property portfolio during the year of 2011. The airline said that its head office building, which was stated by the &quot;International Business Times&quot; to require refurbishing, was too large for the company&#x27;s needs following the &quot;Greenfield&quot; cost reduction programme. On 8 November 2011 Aer Lingus signed the contract with the Dublin Airport Authority for the surrender of the leasehold interest in the HOB Site. Aer Lingus would pay €22.15 million and interest to the DAA, with €10.55 million being paid over ten years in annual payments, with each being equal size. The payments will involve a 5% interest rate per annum. The former HOB Site was redeveloped into Dublin Airport Central, with the Dublin Airport Authority planning to spend €10 million. The former head office became One, Dublin Airport Central.

=== Employee relations ===
On 30 May 2014, Aer Lingus cabin crew staged a 24-hour strike resulting in the cancellation of around 200 flights and the disruption of travel plans by up to 200,000 people. The workers were seeking changes to their rosters, which the airline said that if implemented would mean the loss of 300 jobs in Ireland, which would have to be relocated to North America.

=== Sponsorships ===
Aer Lingus sponsored the Irish Times International Fiction Prize from 1989 to 1992, when it was also known as the Irish Times/Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize.

On 30 April 2015, it was announced that Aer Lingus would become the official airline of the Irish Rugby Team. On the same day, it was announced that one aircraft was to be renamed &quot;Green Spirit&quot; and wear a special livery for the Irish Rugby Team. Another aircraft would also be painted in the same livery.

== Destinations and hubs ==

As of June 2024, Aer Lingus flies to 93 destinations throughout Asia, Europe and North America; including destinations in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

In October 2022, it was announced that Aer Lingus operations between Belfast City and London Heathrow would transfer to Aer Lingus UK due to Brexit-related requirements that a European carrier could no longer fly domestic routes within the United Kingdom. These flights were operated by British Airways under wet-lease terms using the Aer Lingus UK flight numbers and callsigns.

=== Hubs ===

Aer Lingus currently has five hubs:

* Dublin – Aer Lingus uses Dublin as its primary hub for almost all transatlantic and international flights, serving many European, American, African, Asian, South American and a majority of their UK-based routes. Dublin serves as the airline’s primary maintenance base.
* Cork – Despite a cut back in operations in recent years, Cork is still an important base for Aer Lingus. There are three aircraft based at the airport operating 10 services to the UK, and Europe. 
* Shannon – In smaller operations Aer Lingus serves Shannon as a secondary hub for onward connections onto transatlantic flights. Aer Lingus operate short-haul flights to London-Heathrow and Paris-Charles de Gaulle which they use to feed their daily transatlantic flights to and from Boston and New York-JFK. 
* Belfast – The service provided from Belfast is primarily within the UK but some international European flights operate into Belfast. After Brexit, Aer Lingus moved to provide more UK service out of Belfast than Dublin as travel laws affected the operations.
* Manchester – Aer Lingus bases two Airbus A330 aircraft and serves Barbados, New York-JFK and Orlando from its Manchester hub.

=== Codeshare agreements ===
Aer Lingus has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Air Canada
* Alaska Airlines
* American Airlines
* British Airways
* Iberia
* JetBlue
* Loganair
* Qatar Airways
* Vueling

== Fleet ==

=== Current fleet ===
, Aer Lingus operates an all-Airbus fleet composed of the following aircraft:

Aer Lingus aircraft are named after Christian saints from Ireland.

===Fleet development===

In January 2017, Aer Lingus announced its intention to finalise an order for eight A321LR twinjets to develop thinner transatlantic routes which cannot be operated profitably and fuel efficiently using A330s. As of November 2018, the airline has orders for 14 A321LRs.

At the 2019 Paris Air Show, IAG agreed to purchase 14 Airbus A321XLR aircraft, eight for delivery to Iberia and six to Aer Lingus, with options for a further 14 of the aircraft. The first aircraft will be delivered in 2025.
In April 2020, Aer Lingus terminated their contract with the Irish airline CityJet which operated two BAE Avro RJ85&#x27;s on behalf of the airline. The aircraft were primarily used for the Dublin to London-City route.

=== Historical fleet ===


=== Livery ===
On 17 January 2019, Aer Lingus unveiled a new brand and livery. The refreshed brand includes a new typeface, refreshed shamrock and a new colour scheme. The new livery consists of a white fuselage and teal engines and tail. All Aer Lingus aircraft were expected to receive the new livery by the end of 2021, although some aircraft with the older livery are still in service as of 2024.

== Services ==
===In-flight services===
From 2015 to 2016, Aer Lingus sold pre-packaged Tayto sandwiches on board some of their flights. In 2018, the company announced that it would offer a complimentary glass of wine or beer on transatlantic flights. That year the company also announced plans to offer free wifi to Smart Fare transatlantic economy customers. In 2019, Aer Lingus introduced AerSpace, its premium economy class.

=== Frequent-flyer programme ===
AerClub is Aer Lingus&#x27; frequent-flyer programme. It launched in November 2016, taking over from the airline&#x27;s previous programme, Gold Circle. AerClub consists of four tiers: the entry-level Green, Silver, Platinum, and Concierge. The club uses Avios points as its member currency.

== Accidents and incidents ==

Aer Lingus has a good safety record, with no crash fatalities in over 55 years. It has had 12 incidents, including six accidents which left aircraft written-off (of which three were fatal) and one hijacking.

*On 10 January 1952, a Douglas DC-3 registered EI-AFL and named &quot;St. Kevin&quot; was en route from Northolt to Dublin. It flew into a mountain wave triggered by Snowdon and an area of extreme turbulence, then crashed in a peat bog near Llyn Gwynant in Snowdonia, killing all 20 passengers and 3 crew. It was the company&#x27;s first fatal accident.
*On 1 January 1953, a Douglas DC-3 registered EI-ACF and named &quot;St Kieran&quot; made a forced landing near the town of Spernall, England. Both engines failed after running out of fuel while en route from Dublin to Birmingham. All of the 25 passengers and crew survived. The aircraft was later written off.
*On 22 June 1967, a Vickers Viscount registered EI-AOF on a pilot-training flight stalled and spun into the ground near Ashbourne, killing all three crew.
*On 21 September 1967, a Vickers Viscount registered EI-AKK flying from Dublin to Bristol encountered problems whilst landing, damaging its wingtip and no.4 propeller on the runway. A go-around was attempted, but rapidly aborted; the aircraft then belly-landing and sliding beyond the end of the runway. All 21 of the passengers and crew survived, but the aircraft was written off.
*On 24 March 1968, Aer Lingus Flight 712, a flight from Cork to London operated by a Vickers Viscount registered EI-AOM, crashed into the sea off the southeast coast of Ireland near Tuskar Rock. All 57 passengers and four crew perished. The crash is generally known as the Tuskar Rock Air Disaster in Ireland. Part of the aircraft&#x27;s elevator spring tab was found some distance from the rest of the wreckage, suggesting that it had become detached at an earlier stage. However, the original accident report published in 1970, reached no definitive conclusion about the cause of the crash but did not exclude the possibility that another aircraft or airborne object was involved. Following persistent rumours that the aircraft&#x27;s demise was linked with nearby British military exercises, a review of the case files by the Air Accident Investigation Unit took place in 1998. This review identified several maintenance and record-keeping failures and concluded that the original report failed to adequately examine alternative hypotheses not involving other aircraft. A subsequent investigation concluded that the accident followed an initial unspecified event involving the tail structure, subsequently leading to a major structural failure of the port tailplane. The exact cause was not positively identified, but was likely due to corrosion, fatigue, or possibly a birdstrike. The possibility that another aircraft was involved was ruled out.
*On 2 May 1981, Aer Lingus Flight 164 from Dublin to London was hijacked and diverted to Le Touquet – Côte d&#x27;Opale Airport in France. While authorities negotiated with the hijacker by radio in the cockpit, French special forces entered the rear of the aircraft and overpowered him. None of the passengers or crew were injured during the hijacking. The official record shows the reason as &quot;One hijacker demanded to be taken to Iran. Plane stormed/hijacker arrested. Duration of the hijacking: less than one day.&quot; while various media reports indicated that the man, Laurence Downey (a former Trappist monk), demanded that the Pope release the third secret of Fátima.
*On 31 January 1986, Aer Lingus Flight 328, a Short 360 registration EI-BEM on a flight from Dublin to East Midlands Airport, struck power lines and crashed short of the runway. There were no fatalities but two passengers were injured in the accident.
*On 9 June 2005, Aer Lingus Flight 132, an Airbus A330 registration EI-ORD, nearly collided with US Airways Flight 1170 at Logan International Airport in Boston, after both flights were given nearly simultaneous clearances for takeoff on intersecting runways. The US Airways flight kept its nose down on the runway for an extended amount of time to go underneath the Aer Lingus flight and avoided a collision. There were no fatalities.
*On 22 December 2024, an Aer Lingus ATR 72 (operated by Emerald Airlines) flight code EA701P, suffered a nose wheel collapse on landing at Belfast City Airport. As the flight was a positioning flight, no passengers were onboard and no injuries or casualties were reported. It was reported that there were severe winds in the vicinity at the time.

<text>Alfred Friedrich Delp (; 15 September 1907 – 2 February 1945) was a German Jesuit priest and philosopher of the German Resistance. A member of the inner Kreisau Circle resistance group, he is considered a significant figure in Catholic resistance to Nazism. Falsely implicated in the failed 1944 July Plot to overthrow Adolf Hitler, Delp was arrested and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1945.

== Early life and education ==
Alfred Delp was born in Mannheim, Grand Duchy of Baden, to a Catholic mother Maria, née Bernauer and a Protestant father Johann Adam Friedrich Delp. Although he was baptised as a Catholic, he attended a Protestant elementary school and was confirmed in the Lutheran church in 1921. This was due to the influence of his paternal grandmother. Following a bitter argument with the Lutheran pastor, he requested and received the sacraments of First Communion and Confirmation in the Catholic Church. His Catholic pastor recognized the boy&#x27;s intelligence and love for learning and arranged for him to study at the &quot;Goetheschule&quot; in Dieburg. Possibly because of the dual upbringing, he became later an ardent proponent of radically better relations between the Churches.

Thereafter, Delp&#x27;s youth was moulded mainly by the Bund Neudeutschland Catholic youth movement. Immediately after passing his Abitur – in which he was top of his class – he joined the Society of Jesus in 1926. Following philosophy studies at Pullach, he worked for 3 years as a prefect and sports teacher at Stella Matutina Kolleg in Feldkirch, Austria, where in 1933, he first experienced the Nazi regime, which forced an exodus of virtually all German students from Austria and thus the Stella Matutina by means of a punitive 1000 Mark fine to be paid by anyone entering Austria. With his Director, Fr Otto Faller and Professor Alois Grimm, he was among the first to arrive in the Black Forest, where the Jesuits opened Kolleg St. Blasien for some 300 students forced out of Austria. After St. Blasien, he completed his theology studies in Valkenburg, The Netherlands (1934–1936), and in Frankfurt (1936–1937).

== Ministry ==
In 1935, Delp published his &quot;Tragic Existence&quot;, propagating a God-based humanism and reviewing the existentialism of Martin Heidegger. In 1937, Delp was ordained a Catholic priest in Munich. Delp had wanted to study for a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Munich, but he was refused admission to the university for political reasons. From 1939 on, he worked on the editorial staff of the Jesuit journal &quot;Stimmen der Zeit&quot; (&quot;Voices of the Times&quot;), until the Nazis suppressed it in April 1941. He was then assigned as rector of St. Georg Church, part of Heilig-Blut Parish in the Munich neighbourhood Bogenhausen. He preached both at Heilig-Blut and St. Georg, and also secretly helped Jews who were escaping to Switzerland through the underground.

== Resistance ==
Outspoken opposition to the Nazis by individual Jesuits resulted in harsh response from government officials, including imprisonment of priests in concentration camps. The government takeover of church property, &quot;Klostersturm&quot;, resulted in the loss of valuable properties such as that of &quot;Stimmen der Zeit&quot;, and limited the work of the Jesuits in Germany. The Jesuit provincial, Augustin Rösch, Delp&#x27;s superior in Munich, became active in the underground resistance to Hitler.

Rösch introduced Delp to the Kreisau Circle. As of 1942, Delp met regularly with the clandestine group around Helmuth James Graf von Moltke to develop a model for a new social order after the Third Reich came to an end. Delp&#x27;s role was to explain Catholic social teaching to the group, and to arrange contacts between Moltke and Catholic leaders, including Archbishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin and Bishop Johannes Dietz of Fulda.

== Arrest and trial ==
After the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler failed, a special Gestapo commission arrested and interrogated all known members of the Resistance. Delp was arrested in Munich on 28 July 1944 (eight days after Claus von Stauffenberg&#x27;s attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life), although he was not directly involved in the plot. He was transferred to Tegel Prison in Berlin. While in prison, he secretly began to say Mass and wrote letters, reflections on Advent, on Christmas, and other spiritual subjects, which were smuggled out of the prison before his trial. On 8 December 1944, Delp had a visit from Franz von Tattenbach SJ, sent by Rösch to receive his final vows to the Jesuit Order. This was supposedly forbidden, but the attending policemen did not understand what was going on. Delp wrote on the same day, “It was too much, what a fulfillment, I prayed for it so much, I gave my life away. My chains are now without any meaning, because God found me worthy of the &#x27;Vincula amoris&#x27; (chains of love)”.

He was tried, together with Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, Franz Sperr, and Eugen Gerstenmaier, before the People&#x27;s Court (&quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;) on 9–11 January 1945, with Roland Freisler presiding. Delp, von Moltke, and Sperr were sentenced to death by hanging for high treason and treason. The court had dropped the charge against Delp of being aware of the 20 July plot, but his dedication to the Kreisau Circle, his work as a Jesuit priest, and his Christian-social worldview were enough to seal his fate.

== Execution ==
While he was in prison, the Gestapo offered Delp his freedom in return for leaving the Jesuits, but he rejected it. Delp, like all prisoners connected with 20 July, was required to wear handcuffs day and night. Prisoners being taken to execution were handcuffed with their hands behind their backs. The sentence was carried out on 2 February 1945 at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. The next day, Roland Freisler was killed in an air-raid. A special order by Heinrich Himmler required that the remains of all prisoners executed in connection with 20 July Plot be cremated, and their ashes scattered over the sewage fields. Accordingly, the body of Alfred Delp was cremated and his ashes disposed of in an unknown location near Berlin.

== Posthumous honours ==
In September 1949, the superior Fr Otto Faller at Kolleg St. Blasien unveiled memorial plaques for Delp and Alois Grimm, both former educators and teachers slain by the Nazis. Thirty years later, Kolleg St. Blasien named its new theatre hall after Delp. The Alfred Delp Memorial Chapel in Lampertheim was consecrated on 2 February 1965, on the 20th anniversary of his death. Many schools in Germany are named after Alfred Delp, among them one in Bremerhaven. In Mannheim, a Catholic student residence is named for him. The guesthouse on the campus of Canisius College in Berlin also bears his name. In Dieburg, the uppermost level at the Gymnasium, the Alfred Delp School, the Catholic community centre, the Father Delp House, and a street are named after him. The Bundeswehr named its barracks in Donauwörth the &quot;Alfred-Delp-Kaserne&quot;. In 1955, the Wasserburgerstrasse, a street in Munich-Bogenhausen where Eva Braun resided beginning in 1935, has been renamed Delpstrasse.

Delp&#x27;s name was included among the almost other 900 Catholics in a list of people having suffered a violent death for adherence to the Christian faith, published in 1999 as &quot;Zeugen für Christus. Das deutsche Martyrologium des 20. Jahrhunderts&quot; (&quot;Witnesses for Christ. The German Martyrology of the 20th century&quot;), prepared by Mgr Helmut Moll under the auspices of the German Bishops&#x27; Conference.

== Beatification process ==
Delp&#x27;s final parish in Munich sent documentation supporting the start of his official beatification process to the Archbishop of Berlin, Cardinal Georg Sterzinsky, in January 1990.

== Writings ==
Delp&#x27;s book &quot;In the Face of Death&quot;, published in 1956, gathered together his meditations, notes, fragments of his diary and letters, written during his six months imprisonment, and has been compared to Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Papers from Prison&quot;. It is the first part of a trilogy that includes &quot;Committed to the Earth&quot; and &quot;The Mighty God&quot;. The American edition of his &quot;Prison Meditations&quot; (1963) had an introduction by Thomas Merton, who considered him a mystic and among the most insightful writers of his time. The German edition of his &quot;Collected Works&quot; (1982–1988) was edited by Fr. Roman Bleistein SJ in five volumes.

Delp is best known for his writings that were smuggled out of prison. Because he was imprisoned during the Christmas season, many of these are on the theme of Advent and the coming of Jesus. In one of his last letters, Delp wrote, &quot;...all of life is Advent&quot;. Many Christians continue to read and be inspired by Delp&#x27;s life and witness.

== Quotes ==
*God does not need great pathos or great works. He needs greatness of hearts. He cannot calculate with zeroes
*It is the time of sowing, not of harvesting. God is sowing; one day He will harvest again. I will try to do one thing. I will try to at least be a healthy and fruitful seed, falling into the soil. And into the Lord God&#x27;s hand.
*Whoever does not have the courage to make history, becomes its poor object. Let&#x27;s do it!
*Many of the things that are happening today would never have happened if we had been living in that longing, that disquiet of heart which comes when we are faced with God, and when we look clearly at things as they really are. If we had done this, God would have withheld his hand from many of the things that now shake and crush our lives. We would have come to terms with and judged the limits of our own competence.
*When we get out of here, we will show, that (ecumenicism) is more than personal friendship. We will continue to carry the historical burden of our separated churches, as baggage and inheritance. But never again shall it became shameful to Christ. Like you, I do not believe in the utopia of complete unity stews. But the one Christ is undivided, and when undivided love leads to Him, we will do better than our fighting predecessors and contemporaries.
*If there was a little more light and truth in the world through one human being, his life has had meaning.
*In half an hour, I&#x27;ll know more than you do.
*We need people who are moved by the horrific calamities and emerge from them with the knowledge that those who look to the Lord will be preserved by Him, even if they are hounded from the earth.
*Someday, others shall be able to live better and happier lives because we died.

<text>A gold rush or gold fever is a discovery of gold—sometimes accompanied by other precious metals and rare-earth minerals—that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune. Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia, Greece, New Zealand, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, the United States, and Canada while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere. 

In the 19th century, the wealth that resulted was distributed widely because of reduced migration costs and low barriers to entry. While gold mining itself proved unprofitable for most diggers and mine owners, some people made large fortunes, and merchants and transportation facilities made large profits. The resulting increase in the world&#x27;s gold supply stimulated global trade and investment. Historians have written extensively about the mass migration, trade, colonization, and environmental history associated with gold rushes.

Gold rushes were typically marked by a general buoyant feeling of a &quot;free-for-all&quot; in income mobility, in which any single individual might become abundantly wealthy almost instantly, as expressed in the California Dream.

Gold rushes helped spur waves of immigration that often led to the permanent settlement of new regions. Activities propelled by gold rushes define significant aspects of the culture of the Australian and North American frontiers. At a time when the world&#x27;s money supply was based on gold, the newly-mined gold provided economic stimulus far beyond the goldfields, feeding into local and wider economic booms.

The Gold Rush was a topic that inspired many TV shows and books considering it was a very important topic at the time. During various gold rushes, many books were published including &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, which had much success during the period.

Gold rushes occurred as early as the times of ancient Greece, whose gold mining was described by Diodarus Sicules and Pliny the Elder.

==Surviving the gold rush==

Within each mining rush there is typically a transition through progressively higher capital expenditures, larger organizations, and more specialized knowledge.

A rush typically begins with the discovery of placer gold made by an individual. At first the gold may be washed from the sand and gravel by individual miners with little training, using a gold pan or similar simple instrument. Once it is clear that the volume of gold-bearing sediment is larger than a few cubic metres, the placer miners will build rockers or sluice boxes, with which a small group can wash gold from the sediment many times faster than using gold pans. Winning the gold in this manner requires almost no capital investment, only a simple pan or equipment that may be built on the spot, and only simple organisation. The low investment, the high value per unit weight of gold, and the ability of gold dust and gold nuggets to serve as a medium of exchange, allow placer gold rushes to occur even in remote locations.

After the sluice-box stage, placer mining may become increasingly large scale, requiring larger organisations and higher capital expenditures. Small claims owned and mined by individuals may need to be merged into larger tracts. Difficult-to-reach placer deposits may be mined by tunnels. Water may be diverted by dams and canals to placer mine active river beds or to deliver water needed to wash dry placers. The more advanced techniques of ground sluicing, hydraulic mining and dredging may be used.

Typically the heyday of a placer gold rush would last only a few years. The free gold supply in stream beds would become depleted somewhat quickly, and the initial phase would be followed by prospecting for veins of lode gold that were the original source of the placer gold. Hard rock mining, like placer mining, may evolve from low capital investment and simple technology to progressively higher capital and technology. The surface outcrop of a gold-bearing vein may be oxidized, so that the gold occurs as native gold, and the ore needs only to be crushed and washed (free milling ore). The first miners may at first build a simple arrastra to crush their ore; later, they may build stamp mills to crush ore at greater speed. As the miners venture downwards, they may find that the deeper part of vein contains gold locked in sulfide or telluride minerals, which will require smelting. If the ore is still sufficiently rich, it may be worth shipping to a distant smelter (direct shipping ore). Lower-grade ore may require on-site treatment to either recover the gold or to produce a concentrate sufficiently rich for transport to the smelter. As the district turns to lower-grade ore, the mining may change from underground mining to large open-pit mining.

Many silver rushes followed upon gold rushes. As transportation and infrastructure improve, the focus may change progressively from gold to silver to base metals. In this way, Leadville, Colorado started as a placer gold discovery, achieved fame as a silver-mining district, then relied on lead and zinc in its later days. Butte, Montana began mining placer gold, then became a silver-mining district, then became for a time the world&#x27;s largest copper producer.

==By region==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
Various gold rushes occurred in Australia over the second half of the 19th century. The most significant of these, although not the only ones, were the New South Wales gold rush and Victorian gold rush in 1851, and the Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s. They were highly significant to their respective colonies&#x27; political and economic development as they brought many immigrants, and promoted massive government spending on infrastructure to support the new arrivals who came looking for gold. While some found their fortune, those who did not often remained in the colonies and took advantage of extremely liberal land laws to take up farming.

Gold rushes happened at or around:
In New Zealand the Otago gold rush from 1861 attracted prospectors from the California gold rush and the Victorian gold rush and many moved on to the West Coast gold rush from 1864.

===North America===
The first significant gold rush in the United States was in Cabarrus County, North Carolina (east of Charlotte), in 1799 at today&#x27;s Reed&#x27;s Gold Mine. Thirty years later, in 1829, the Georgia Gold Rush in the southern Appalachians occurred. It was followed by the California Gold Rush of 1848–55 in the Sierra Nevada, which captured the popular imagination. The California Gold Rush led to an influx of gold miners and newfound gold wealth, which led to California&#x27;s rapid industrialization, as businesses sprung up to serve the increased population and financial and political institutions to handle the increased wealth. One of these political institutions was statehood; the need for new laws in a sparsely-governed land led to the state&#x27;s rapid entry into the Union in 1850.

The gold rush in 1849 also stimulated worldwide interest in prospecting for gold, leading to further rushes in Australia, South Africa, Wales and Scotland. Successive gold rushes occurred in western North America: Fraser Canyon, the Cariboo district and other parts of British Columbia, in Nevada, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, and western New Mexico Territory and along the lower Colorado River. There was a gold rush in Nova Scotia (1861–1876) which produced nearly 210,000 ounces of gold. Resurrection Creek, near Hope, Alaska was the site of Alaska&#x27;s first gold rush in the mid–1890s. Other notable Alaska Gold Rushes were Nome, Fairbanks, and the Fortymile River.

One of the last &quot;great gold rushes&quot; was the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon Territory (1896–99). This gold rush is featured in the novels of Jack London, and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;. Robert William Service depicted in his poetries the Gold Rush, especially in the book &quot;The Trail of &#x27;98&quot;. The main goldfield was along the south flank of the Klondike River near its confluence with the Yukon River near what was to become Dawson City in Yukon Territory, but it also helped open up the relatively new US possession of Alaska to exploration and settlement, and promoted the discovery of other gold finds.

The most successful of the North American gold rushes was the Porcupine Gold Rush in Timmins, Ontario area. This gold rush was unique compared to others by the method of extraction of the gold. Placer mining techniques were not able to be used to access the gold in the area due to it being embedded into the Canadian Shield, so larger mining operations involving significantly more expensive equipment was required. While this gold rush peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, it is still active today with over 200 million ounces of gold having been produced from the region. The gold deposits in this area are identified as one of the largest in the world.

===Africa===
In South Africa, the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in the Transvaal was important to that country&#x27;s history, leading to the founding of Johannesburg and tensions between the Boers and British settlers as well as the Chinese miners.

South African gold production went from zero in 1886 to 23% of the total world output in 1896. At the time of the South African rush, gold production benefited from the newly discovered techniques by Scottish chemists, the MacArthur-Forrest process, of using potassium cyanide to extract gold from low-grade ore.

===South America===
The gold mine at El Callao (Venezuela), started in 1871, was for a time one of the richest in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating an English colony on Venezuelan territory. 

Between 1883 and 1906 Tierra del Fuego experienced a gold rush attracting many Chileans, Argentines and Europeans to the archipelago. The gold rush began in 1884 following discovery of gold during the rescue of the French steamship &quot;Arctique&quot; near Cape Virgenes.

==Mining industry today==
There are about 10 to 30 million small-scale miners around the world, according to Communities and Small-Scale Mining (CASM). Approximately 100 million people are directly or indirectly dependent on small-scale mining. For example, there are 800,000 to 1.5 million artisanal miners in Democratic Republic of Congo, 350,000 to 650,000 in Sierra Leone, and 150,000 to 250,000 in Ghana, with millions more across Africa.

In an exclusive report, Reuters accounted the smuggling of billions of dollars&#x27; worth of gold out of Africa through the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East, which further acts as a gateway to the markets in the United States, Europe and more. The news agency evaluated the worth and magnitude of illegal gold trade occurring in African nations like Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia, by comparing the total gold imports recorded into the UAE with the exports affirmed by the African states. According to Africa&#x27;s industrial mining firms, they have not exported any amount of gold to the UAE – confirming that the imports come from other, illegal sources. As per customs data, the UAE imported gold worth $15.1 billion from Africa in 2016, with a total weight of 446 tons, in variable degrees of purity. Much of the exports were not recorded in the African states, which means a huge volume of gold imports were carried out with no taxes paid to the states producing it.

<text>Yazdegerd II (also spelled Yazdgerd and Yazdgird; ), was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 438 to 457. He was the successor and son of Bahram V ().

His reign was marked by wars against the Eastern Roman Empire in the west and the Kidarites in the east, as well as by his efforts and attempts to strengthen royal centralisation in the bureaucracy by imposing Zoroastrianism on the non-Zoroastrians within the country, namely the Christians. This backfired in Armenia, culminating in a large-scale rebellion led by the military leader Vardan Mamikonian, who was ultimately defeated and killed at the Battle of Avarayr in 451. Nevertheless, religious freedom was subsequently allowed in the country.

Yazdegerd II was the first Sasanian ruler to assume the title of &quot;kay&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), which evidently associates him and the dynasty to the mythical Kayanian dynasty commemorated in the Avesta. His death led to a dynastic struggle between his two sons Hormizd III and Peroz I for the throne, with the latter emerging victorious.

== Etymology ==
The name of Yazdegerd is a combination of the Old Iranian &quot;yazad yazata&quot;- &quot;divine being&quot; and &quot;-karta&quot; &quot;made&quot;, and thus stands for &quot;God-made&quot;, comparable to Iranian &quot;Bagkart&quot; and Greek &quot;Theoktistos&quot;. The name of Yazdegerd is known in other languages as; Pahlavi &quot;Yazdekert&quot;; New Persian &quot;Yazd(e)gerd&quot;; Syriac &quot;Yazdegerd&quot;, &quot;Izdegerd&quot;, and &quot;Yazdeger&quot;; Armenian &quot;Yazkert&quot;; Talmudic &quot;Izdeger&quot; and &quot;Azger&quot;; Arabic &quot;Yazdeijerd&quot;; Greek &quot;Isdigerdes&quot;.

== War with the Romans ==

In 438, shah Bahram V () died, and was succeeded by Yazdegerd II. His western neighbours, the Romans, had since their peace treaty with Iran in 387 agreed that both empires were obligated to cooperate in the defense of the Caucasus against nomadic attacks. The Romans helped in the defense of the Caucasus by paying the Iranians roughly 500 lbs (226 kg) of gold at irregular intervals. While the Romans saw this payment as political subsidies, the Iranians saw it as tribute, which proved that Rome was the deputy of Iran. The Roman emperor Theodosius II&#x27;s unwillingness to continue the payment made Yazdegerd II declare war against the Romans, which had ultimately little success for either side.

The Romans were invaded in their southern provinces by the Vandals, causing Theodosius II to ask for peace and send his commander, Anatolius, personally to Yazdegerd II&#x27;s camp. In the ensuing negotiations in 440, both empires promised not to build any new fortifications in Mesopotamia and that the Sasanian Empire would get some payment in order to protect the Caucasus from incursions.

== War with the Huns ==

Since the reign of Shapur II (), Iran had to deal with nomadic invaders in the east known as &quot;Iranian Huns&quot; and made up of Hephthalites, Kidarites, Chionites and Alkhans). They seized Tokharistan and Gandhara from Shapur II and his Kushano-Sasanian clients, and eventually Kabul from Shapur III (). Archaeological, numismatic, and sigillographic evidence demonstrates the Huns ruled a realm just as refined as that of the Sasanians. They swiftly adopted Iranian imperial symbolism and titulature. Their coins also imitated Sasanian imperial coinage. The modern historian Richard Payne states: &quot;Far from the destructive &quot;xyonan&quot; of the Iranian accounts or the marauding barbarians of the Roman historians, the Hun kingdoms of post-Iranian Central Asia were city-based, tax-raising, ideologically innovative states the kings of kings found themselves hard pressed to unseat&quot;. Hard-pressed by the Huns, Iran fought an almost uninterrupted war with them on its northern and northeastern marches, notably under Bahram V and Yazdegerd II, who both attempted to regain Tokharistan, but only succeeded in preserving Abarshahr. The Sasanian efforts were disrupted in the early 5th century by the Kidarites, who forced Yazdegerd I (), Bahram V, and/or Yazdegerd II to pay them tribute. Although this did not trouble the Iranian treasury, it was nevertheless humiliating. Yazdegerd II eventually refused to pay tribute.

In 450, he launched an expedition into deep Kidarite territory in Central Asia, raiding and capturing forts and cities, which resulted in the accumulation of many captives and riches. In 453, he moved his court to Nishapur in Abarshahr to face the threat from the Kidarites and left his minister (&quot;wuzurg framadar&quot;) Mihr Narseh in charge of the Sasanian Empire. He spent many years at war against the Kidarites. His forces initially suffered a severe defeat, but fighting continued. According to the &quot;Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr&quot; (&quot;The Provincial Capitals of Iran&quot;), Yazdegerd II fortified the city of Damghan and turned it into a strong border post against the Kidarites. It was sometime during this period that Yazdegerd II created the province of &quot;Eran-Khwarrah-Yazdegerd&quot; (&quot;Iran, glory of Yazdegerd&quot;), which was in the northern part of the Gurgan province. After he managed to secure the eastern portion of his empire against the Kidarite incursions, Yazdegerd II shifted his focus on Armenia and Caucasian Albania to defend the Caucasus with the Romans against the increasing Hun threat.

== Religious policy ==

The policies of Yazdegerd II have been a matter of discussion; Arabic and Persian sources emphasize his personal piety and hostility towards the aristocracy, while Armenian and Syriac sources describe him as a religious fanatic. The latter aspect is often stressed in modern historiography. The unsteadiness of the empire was ever-increasing under Yazdegerd II, who had an uneasy relationship with the aristocracy and was facing a great challenge by the Kidarite in the east. At the beginning of Yazdegerd II&#x27;s reign, he suffered several defeats at the hands of the Kidarites, for which he put the blame on the Christians, due to much of his cavalry consisting of Iberians and Armenians. Persecutions of Christians first started in 446 with the Christian nobles of Karkh in Mesopotamia. He later shifted his focus towards the Christian aristocracy of Iberia and Armenia. Yazdegerd II&#x27;s persecutions of non-Zoroastrians generally seem to have been limited, with the aristocracy being the primary target.

Yazdegerd II had originally continued his father&#x27;s policies of appeasing the magnates. However, after some time, he turned away from them and started a policy of his own. When the magnates told him that his new policies had offended the people, he disagreed, saying that: &quot;it is not correct for you to presume that the ways in which my father behaved towards you, maintaining you close to him, and bestowing upon you all that bounty, are incumbent upon all the kings that come after him ... each age has its own customs&quot;. Yazdegerd II, however, was still fully aware of the longstanding conflict between the crown and the nobility and priesthood, which had culminated in the murder of several Sasanian monarchs. 

Yazdegerd II&#x27;s primary goal throughout his reign was thus to combat the internal and external issues posing a danger to country by strengthening the royal centralisation of the bureaucracy, which demanded the cooperation of the aristocracy. The justification behind this is later apparent when Yazdegerd II appointed Adhur-Hormizd as the new governor (&quot;marzban&quot;) of Armenia in 451, putting an end to the persecution of non-Zoroastrians in Armenia and allowing religious freedom in the country. This would have been an unlikely decision to have been made by a religious fanatic. Indeed, according to the modern historian Scott McDonough, the Zoroastrian faith was perhaps a &quot;test of personal loyalty&quot; for Yazdegerd II. He also targeted Zoroastrian aristocrats, dismantling their advantage of entry to the court and castrated men in his field armies to generate eunuchs more dutiful to him than to their own families. However, Yazdegerd II&#x27;s policy of integrating the Christian nobility into the bureaucracy still had problematic consequences; before the appointment of Adhur-Hormizd, Armenia had been plunged into a major rebellion. The cause of the rebellion was the attempt of Mihr Narseh to impose the Zurvanite variant of Zoroastrianism in Armenia. His intentions differed from those of Yazdegerd II. As a result, many of the Armenian nobles (but not all) rallied under Vardan Mamikonian, the supreme commander (&quot;sparapet&quot;) of Armenia. The Armenian rebels tried to appeal to the Romans for help, but to no avail. Meanwhile, another faction of Armenians, led by the &quot;marzban&quot; Vasak Siwni allied themselves with the Sasanians.

On 2 June 451, the Sasanian and rebel forces clashed at Avarayr, with the Sasanians emerging victorious. Nine generals, including Vardan Mamikonian, were killed, with a large number of the Armenian nobles and soldiers meeting the same fate. The Sasanians, however, had also suffered heavy losses due to the resolute struggle by the Armenian rebels. Although Yazdegerd II put an end to the persecutions in the country afterward, tensions continued until 510 when a kinsman of Vardan Mamikonian, Vard Mamikonian, was appointed &quot;marzban&quot; by Yazdegerd II&#x27;s grandson, Kavad I ().

Jews were also the subject of persecution under Yazdegerd II; he is said to have issued decrees prohibiting them from observing the Sabbath openly, and ordered executions of several Jewish leaders. This resulted in the Jewish community of Spahan publicly retaliating by flaying two Zoroastrian priests alive, leading in turn to more persecutions against the Jews.

== Personality ==
Yazdegerd II was an astute and well-read ruler whose motto was &quot;Question, examine, see. Let us choose and hold that which is best&quot;. He is generally praised in Persian sources, and is described as a compassionate and benevolent ruler. He is commended for abandoning his father&#x27;s overindulgence in hunting, feasting, and having long audience sessions. According to the medieval historians Ibn al-Balkhi and Hamza al-Isfahani, he was known as &quot;Yazdegerd the Gentle&quot; (&quot;Yazdegerd-e Narm&quot;). However, the favorable account of Yazdegerd II is due to his policy of persecuting non-Zoroastrians within the empire, which appeased the Iranian aristocracy and especially the Zoroastrian priesthood, which sought to use the Sasanian Empire to impose their authority over the religious and cultural life of its people. This is the opposite of the policy of his grandfather and namesake, Yazdegerd I (known as the &quot;sinner&quot;), who is the subject of hostility in Persian sources due to his tolerant policy towards his non-Zoroastrian subjects, and his refusal to comply with the demands of the aristocracy and priesthood.

== Fortifications ==
In the 440s, Yazdegerd II had a mudbrick defensive system constructed at Derbent to fend off incursions from the north. An inscription on one of its walls report that the tribute paid by the Romans was used for the renewal of the fortress. Near the city, he founded the fortified settlement of Shahristan-i Yazdegerd (present-day ruins of Torpakh-kala), which became the main hub of the soldiers stationed in the region, whose leader held the title of &quot;&quot;marzban&quot; of Chol&quot;. According to the New Persian chronicle &quot;Tarikh-i Yazd&quot; (&quot;History of Yazd&quot;) of 1441, the city of Yazd in central Iran was refounded by Yazdegerd II.

== Coin mints and imperial ideology ==

The reign of Yazdegerd II marks the start of a new inscription on the Sasanian coins; &quot;mazdēsn bay kay&quot; (&quot;The Mazda-worshipping majesty, the king&quot;), which displays his fondness of the legendary Avestan dynasty, the Kayanians, who also used the title of &quot;kay&quot;. This is due to a shift in the political perspective of the Sasanian Empire−originally disposed towards the West, was now changed to the East. This shift, which had already started under Yazdegerd I and Bahram V, reached its zenith under Yazdegerd II and his son and successor Peroz I (). It may have been triggered due to the advent of hostile tribes on the eastern front of Iran. The war against the Hunnic tribes may have awakened the mythical rivalry existing between the Iranian Kayanian rulers and their Turanian enemies, which is demonstrated in the Younger Avesta. It may have thus been as a result of the conflict between Iran and its eastern enemies, that resulted in the adoption of the title of &quot;kay&quot;, used by the very same Iranian mythical kings in their war against the Turanians in the East.

Likewise, it was most likely during this period that legendary and epic texts were collected by the Sasanians, including the legend of the Iranian hero-king Fereydun (Frēdōn in Middle Persian), who split up his kingdom among his three sons; his eldest son Salm receiving the empire of the West, Rome; the second eldest Tur receiving the empire of the East, Turan; and the youngest Iraj receiving the heartland of the empire, Iran. Accordingly, influenced by the texts about the Kayanians, Yazdegerd II may believed to be the heir of the Fereydun and Iraj, thus possibly deeming not only Roman domains in West as belonging to Iran, but also the eastern domains of the Huns. Thus the Sasanians may have sought to symbolically assert their rights over those lands by assuming the Kayanian title of &quot;kay&quot;. The traditional titulature of &quot;King of Kings&quot; was generally missing from Yazdegerd II&#x27;s coinage.

A new design also appeared on the reverse of the Sasanian coins, where the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants, now imitates them in a more venerated manner. This presumably further demonstrates Yazdegerd II&#x27;s fealty to Zoroastrianism. The provinces of Asoristan and Khuzistan provided the most mints for Yazdegerd II in the west, whilst the provinces of Gurgan and Marw provided the most in the east, undoubtedly to support the Sasanians in their wars on the two fronts.

== Death and succession ==
Yazdegerd II died in 457; he had reportedly not designed a successor and instead—according to the medieval historian al-Tha&#x27;alibi—entrusted the task to the elite. Civil war soon followed; his eldest son Hormizd III ascended to the throne at the city of Ray in northern Iran, while Peroz fled to the northeastern part of the empire and began raising an army in order to claim the throne for himself. The empire thus fell into a dynastic struggle and became divided. The mother of the two brothers, Denag, temporarily ruled as regent of the empire from its capital, Ctesiphon.

<text>Yazdegerd I (also spelled Yazdgerd and Yazdgird; ) was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 399 to 420. A son of Shapur III (), he succeeded his brother Bahram IV () after the latter&#x27;s assassination.

Yazdegerd I&#x27;s largely-uneventful reign is seen in Sasanian history as a period of renewal. Although he was periodically known as &quot;the Sinner&quot; in native sources, Yazdegerd was more competent than his recent predecessors. He enjoyed cordial relations with the Eastern Roman Empire and was entrusted by Arcadius with the guardianship of the latter&#x27;s son Theodosius. Yazdegerd I is known for his friendly relations with Jews and the Christians of the Church of the East, which he acknowledged in 410. Because of this, he was praised by Jews and Christians as the new Cyrus the Great (, king of the Iranian Achaemenid Empire who liberated the Jews from captivity in Babylon).

The king&#x27;s religious, peaceful policies were disliked by the nobility and Zoroastrian clergy, whose power and influence he strove to curb. This eventually backfired, and Yazdegerd I met his end at the hands of the nobility in the remote northeast. The nobles then sought to stop Yazdegerd&#x27;s sons from ascending the throne; his eldest son, Shapur IV, was quickly killed after his accession and replaced with Khosrow. Another son, Bahram V, hurried to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon with an Arab army and pressured the nobility to acknowledge him as shah.

== Etymology ==
The name Yazdegerd is a combination of the Old Iranian &quot;yazad / yazata&quot; (divine being) and &quot;-karta&quot; (made) – &quot;God-made&quot;, comparable to the Iranian &quot;Bagkart&quot; and Greek &quot;Theoktistos&quot;. It is known in other languages as Yazdekert (Pahlavi); Yazd[e]gerd (New Persian); Yazdegerd, Izdegerd and Yazdeger (Syriac); Yazkert (Armenian); Izdeger and Azger (in the Talmud); Yazdeijerd (Arabic), and Isdigerdes (Greek).

== Background ==

Yazdegerd I was the son of Shapur III (). When Yazdegerd I&#x27;s brother Bahram IV () was assassinated in 399, he succeeded him. Yazdegerd I inherited an empire which had been through tumultuous times; his three previous predecessors, Bahram IV, Shapur III and Ardashir II, had been murdered by the nobility. Most of the high nobility belonged to the powerful Parthian noble families (known as the &quot;wuzurgan&quot;) who were centered on the Iranian Plateau. The backbone of the Sasanian feudal army, they were largely autonomous.

The Sasanian shahs had little control of the &quot;wuzurgan&quot;, and attempts to restrict them were usually costly to the shah (as indicated by the fate of the three previous shahs). The Parthian nobility worked for the Sasanian shah for personal benefits, out of loyalty, and (possibly) an awareness of the Aryan, ie. Iranian, kinship they shared with their Persian overlords. Late in Yazdegerd&#x27;s reign, the powerful Parthian House of Suren became powerful associates of the shah and played a key role in the affairs of the empire. The authority of the Suren family flourished until the end of the reign of Yazdegerd&#x27;s grandson, Yazdegerd II ().

== Relations with the Eastern Roman Empire ==

During Yazdegerd I&#x27;s rule, his western neighbours in the Eastern Roman Empire were in turmoil; the Ostrogoths were raiding the Balkans, the Franks had begun a rebellion, a civil war was raging, and the eastern provinces were rioting. Instead of exploiting the empire&#x27;s weakened state, Yazdegerd I had Roman Christian prisoners who were saved after an Iranian victory over the Huns returned to Roman territory. The Roman emperor Arcadius () asked Yazdegerd for aid to guarantee the succession of his young son, Theodosius, as a result of the shah&#x27;s generosity.

This account is only mentioned by the 6th-century Roman historian Procopius and was questioned by his fellow Roman historian Agathias, who wrote that the report was &quot;on the lips&quot; of &quot;Roman commoners and aristocrats alike&quot; but was absent from contemporary sources. Yazdegerd I agreed to act as Theodosius&#x27; protector, however, and threatened to wage war against whoever sought to put him in danger. According to Procopius, &quot;Loyally observing the behests of Arcadius, [Yazdegerd] adopted and continued without interruption a policy of profound peace with the Romans, and thus preserved the empire for Theodosius.&quot; The shah sent Antiochus, &quot;a most remarkable and highly educated advisor and instructor&quot;, to educate Theodosius.

== Relations with the Christians ==
=== Background ===

Yazdegerd I, like all other Sasanian rulers, was an adherent of Zoroastrianism. One of his predecessors, the powerful Sasanian shah Shapur II (), was thought to have brutally persecuted the Christians of Iran from 340 to 379 in a &quot;Great Persecution&quot;. Although later shahs – Yazdegerd I, Bahram V (), Yazdegerd II (), Peroz I (), Khosrow I () and Khosrow II () – were also said to have persecuted the Church of the East, the church quickly expanded. According to hagiographical sources, this was due to the &quot;unwavering hostility of Zoroastrian religious authorities toward Christians.&quot;

Persecution of the Christians, however, was limited to their religious leaders who had failed to meet the commitment demanded of them by the court. Although Shapur II disciplined leading priestly leaders for insubordination, neither he nor his court persecuted the Christian population as a whole; the &quot;Great Persecution&quot; was fictional. According to the modern historian Eberhard Sauer, Sasanian shahs persecuted other religions only when it was in their urgent political interest to do so. Shapur II&#x27;s killing of Christians was due to the priestly leaders&#x27; refusal to participate more fully in the management of the empire. This was finally achieved during Yazdegerd&#x27;s reign, when the priestly leaders agreed to cooperate with the court.

=== Establishment of the Iranian church ===

Yazdegerd I&#x27;s reign was a landmark for the Christians in Iran. With the counsel of Roman bishop Marutha, he acknowledged the Church of the East in 410; this led to the establishment of the Iranian church, which would declare its independence from the Roman church in 424. Yazdegerd&#x27;s decree has been called the Sasanian version of the 313 Edict of Milan by Roman emperor Constantine the Great (). Churches, shrines to martyrs, and monasteries were soon established under Iranian bureaucracy. They were near the court in the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon, indicating the consent of Yazdegerd (who financed churches with East Syrian or Roman diplomats as their main patrons). One of his gestures of generosity was to permit Christians to bury their dead, which Zoroastrians believed tainted the land.

The number of Christian elites in the bureaucracy increased, a flow which continued until the fall of the empire in 651. Although priestly leaders such as Shemon Bar Sabbae and his colleagues had zealously opposed Shapur II&#x27;s request to participate in the imperial bureaucracy, the bishops began operating as agents of Iran (dissociating themselves from Zoroastrianism) during the fifth century. Yazdegerd made use of the priestly leaders, sending the Patriarch of the Catholicos of Ctesiphon to mediate between himself and his brother (the governor of Pars, in southern Iran). Another patriarch was Yazdegerd&#x27;s ambassador to Theodosius. The shah does not seem to have had much knowledge of Christianity, and was (like Shapur II) more interested in improving his empire&#x27;s political and economic capabilities. Owing to his tolerant treatment of the Christians, he is described in their chronicles as a &quot;noble soul&quot; and a second Cyrus the Great (), the founder of the Iranian Achaemenid Empire.

=== Persecution ===
At the end of Yazdegerd&#x27;s reign, his tolerance of the Christians was tested by their recklessness. Abda, the bishop of Ohrmazd-Ardashir in Khuzestan, and a band of Christian priests and laity levelled a Zoroastrian fire temple in ; the court summoned them to answer for their actions. Yazdegerd was said to ask Abda, &quot;Since you are the chief and leader of these men, why do you allow them to despise our kingdom, to transgress against our command, and to act in accordance with their own will? Do you demolish and destroy our houses of worship and the foundations of our fire temples, which we have received from the fathers of our fathers to honor?&quot; Although Abda hesitated to answer, a priest in his entourage replied: &quot;I demolished the foundation and extinguished the fire because it is not a house of God, nor is the fire the daughter of God.&quot; Demolishing a fire temple was reportedly a way of broadcasting the &quot;victory of Christianity.&quot;

Abda refused to have the fire temple rebuilt, and he and his entourage were executed. At another location, a priest had a sacred fire put out and celebrated mass there. Yazdegerd I, forced to yield to pressure from the Zoroastrian priesthood, changed his policy towards the Christians and ordered them persecuted. Probably due to his change of policy, Yazdegerd appointed Mihr Narseh of the Suren family as his minister (&quot;wuzurg framadar&quot;). This brief persecution did not mar Yazdegerd I&#x27;s representation in Christian sources, some of which justified his actions.

== Relations with the Jews ==

The Jews of Iran were treated so generously and respectfully by Yazdegerd I that their exilarch called him the new Cyrus the Great, who liberated the Jews from captivity in Babylon. Although Yazdegerd reportedly greeted the rabbis pleasantly and quoted scriptures to them, the report may be the product of biased Jewish historiography. He had a Jewish wife, Shushandukht, the daughter of the exilarch. The identity of her father is obscure; he may have been Mar Kahana I, Mar Yemar, or Mar Zutra. The Middle Persian geography text &quot;Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr&quot; (&quot;The Provincial Capitals of Iran&quot;) reports that Yazdegerd had Jews settled in Spahan at Shushandukht&#x27;s request, and she was the mother of his son Bahram V. According to the Iranologist Ernst Herzfeld, the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai in Hamadan was not the burial site of Esther and Mordechai but that of Shushandukht.

== Personality and relations with nobility and clergy ==
Roman sources describe Yazdegerd I as an astute, benevolent and friendly ruler. Said to be well-read, &quot;from the start&quot; he was known for &quot;nobility of character&quot; and as a champion of &quot;the poor and the wretched.&quot; Persian and Arabic sources, however, call him a &quot;sinner&quot; (&quot;bazehkar&quot; or &quot;bezehgar&quot;) and &quot;outcast&quot; (&quot;dabhr&quot;). They describe him as a monarch who misused his authority by intimidating and suppressing the nobility and Zoroastrian clergy. This hostile view of Yazdegerd is due to his peaceful attitude towards the Romans and his religious tolerance of the country&#x27;s non-Zoroastrians (the Christians and Jews).

The hostility of the priesthood towards Yazdegerd was due to his execution of several Zoroastrian priests who disapproved of his friendly management of the religious minorities. Well aware of the fate of his predecessor, Yazdegerd I could not put his trust in the nobility and prevented them from acquiring excessive influence at the expense of royal power; therefore, he was at odds with the nobility and clergy. Yazdegerd was more competent than his recent predecessors, however, and his reign is seen in Sasanian history as a period of renewal.

== Coins and imperial ideology ==

Yazdegerd I&#x27;s coins portray him wearing a combination of the dome-shaped crown used by Ardashir II and two merlons and a crescent moon on the top. His reign marks a shift in the political perspective of the Sasanian Empire, which (originally disposed towards the West) moved to the East. The shift may have been triggered by hostile tribes in eastern Iran. The war with the Iranian Huns may have reawakened the mythical rivalry between the mythological Iranian Kayanian rulers and their Turanian enemies, which is illustrated by Younger Avestan texts. The title of &quot;Ramshahr&quot; (peacekeeper in [his] dominion) was added to the traditional &quot;King of Kings of the Iranians and non-Iranians&quot; on Yazdegerd&#x27;s coins. In the Middle Persian heroic poem &quot;Ayadgar-i Zariran&quot; (&quot;The Testament of Zarer&quot;), the title was used by the last Kayanian monarch (Vishtaspa) and occurs in the 10th-century Zoroastrian &quot;Denkard&quot;. Sasanian interest in Kayanian ideology and history continued until the end of the empire.

Under Yazdegerd I, a mint was established in the city of Yazd (under the mint abbreviation of &quot;YZ&quot;), which demonstrates its increasing importance. A mint was also established in Gurrah, and possibly Gahrum.

== Building activities ==
Yazdegerd I is notable for having ordered the renewal of a number cities, which include Qumis, Hamadan, Susa, Shushtar, and Spahan. His military commanders are said to have founded the cities of Aqda and Maybud.

== Death and succession ==

Yazdegerd I died in 420. According to 5th-century Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, his cause of death was disease. According to an old, popular legend mentioned by Ferdowsi in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, however, he was kicked to death by a white horse which suddenly arose from the Chishmih-i Su or Chishmih-i Sabz (the green spring) adjacent to the city of Tus in the eastern province of Abarshahr. The horse was said to suddenly disappear afterwards. German orientalist Theodor Nöldeke surmised that &quot;Ferdowsi had fecklessly grafted this tradition onto traditions of his hometown, Tus&quot;, and the murder may have taken place in Gurgan; the legend predated Ferdowsi&#x27;s work. Whether Yazdegerd&#x27;s death was in Tus or Gurgan, the legend was probably fabricated by the Parthian nobility who had Yazdegerd I killed in the distant northeast (the traditional homeland of the Parthians and part of the fiefdom of three strong Parthian families, including the Kanarangiyan, who were based in the Tus region).

The nobility and clergy, who despised Yazdegerd I, now strove to strip his sons of kingship. Three are known: Shapur, Bahram and Narseh. Shapur (the governor-king of Armenia) rushed to Ctesiphon and assumed the crown as Shapur IV, but was betrayed by his courtiers and killed. The nobility then placed Bahram IV&#x27;s son, Khosrow, on the throne. Bahram, who had grown up in the Lakhmid court of al-Hira, arrived in Ctesiphon with an Arab army and pressured the nobility to acknowledge him as Shah Bahram V. His brother, Narseh, was appointed governor of Abarshahr.

<doc id="140677" wikidata="Q208463" url="?curid=140677" title="Yazdegerd III">
<text>Yazdegerd III (Romanized &quot;Yazdgerd&quot;, &quot;Yazdgird&quot;) was the last Sasanian King of Kings from 632 to 651. His father was Shahriyar and his grandfather was Khosrow II.

Ascending the throne at the age of eight, the young shah lacked authority and reigned as figurehead, whilst real power was in the hands of the army commanders, courtiers, and powerful members of the aristocracy, who engaged in internecine warfare. The Sasanian Empire was weakened severely by these internal conflicts, resulting in invasions by the Göktürks from the east, and Khazars from the west. Yazdegerd was unable to contain the Rashidun conquest of Iran, and spent most of his reign fleeing from one province to another in the vain hope of raising an army. Yazdegerd met his end at the hands of a miller near Marw in 651, bringing an end to the last pre-Islamic Iranian empire after more than 400 years of rule.

== Etymology ==
The name of Yazdegerd is a combination of the Old Iranian &quot;yazad yazata&quot;- &quot;divine being&quot; and &quot;-karta&quot; &quot;made&quot;, and thus stands for &quot;God-made&quot;, comparable to Iranian &quot;Bagkart&quot; and Greek &quot;Theoktistos&quot;. The name of Yazdegerd is known in other languages as follows: Pahlavi &quot;Yazdekert&quot;; New Persian &quot;Yazd(e)gerd&quot;; Syriac &quot;Yazdegerd&quot;, &quot;Izdegerd&quot;, and &quot;Yazdeger&quot;; Armenian &quot;Yazkert&quot;; Talmudic &quot;Izdeger&quot; and &quot;Azger&quot;; Arabic &quot;Yazdeijerd&quot;; Greek &quot;Isdigerdes&quot;.

== Background ==
Yazdegerd was the son of prince Shahriyar and the grandson of the last prominent shah of Iran, Khosrow II (), who was in 628 overthrown and executed by his own son Kavad II, who proceeded to have all his brothers and half-brothers executed, including Shahriyar. This dealt a heavy blow to the empire, which it would never recover from. Furthermore, the fall of Khosrow II also culminated in a civil war lasting four years, with the most powerful members of the nobility gaining full autonomy and starting to create their own government. The hostilities between the Persian (&quot;Parsig&quot;) and Parthian (&quot;Pahlav&quot;) noble-families were also resumed, which split up the wealth of the nation. A few months later, a devastating plague swept through the western Sasanian provinces, killing half of its population including Kavad II.

He was succeeded by his eight-year-old son Ardashir III, who was killed two years later by the distinguished Sasanian general Shahrbaraz, who was in turn murdered forty days later in a coup by the &quot;Pahlav&quot; leader Farrukh Hormizd, who installed the daughter of Khosrow II, Boran, on the throne. She was deposed a year later, and a succession of rulers followed one another, until Boran was sovereign once more in 631, only to be killed the following year, seemingly by the &quot;Parsig&quot; leader Piruz Khosrow. The most powerful magnates in the empire, Rostam Farrokhzad and Piruz Khosrow, now threatened by their own men, eventually agreed to work together, and installed Yazdegerd III on the throne, thus putting an end to the civil war. He was crowned in the Anahid fire-temple in Istakhr, where he had been hiding during the civil war. The temple was the very place where the first Sasanian shah Ardashir I () had crowned himself, indicating that the reason behind Yazdegerd&#x27;s coronation at the same place was due to hopes for a rejuvenation of the empire. He was almost the last living member of the House of Sasan. Most scholars agree that Yazdegerd was eight years old at his coronation.

== Reign ==
===Conditions of the empire===

Yazdegerd, however, did not have the authority required to bring stability to his extensive empire, which was swiftly falling apart due to ceaseless internal conflicts between the army commanders, courtiers, and powerful members of the aristocracy, who were fighting amongst themselves and wiping each other out. Many of the governors of the empire had proclaimed independence and carved out their own kingdom. The governors of the provinces of Mazun and Yemen had already asserted their independence during the civil war of 628–632, thus resulting in the disintegration of Sasanian rule in the Arabian Peninsula, which was uniting under the banner of Islam. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that the Sasanians had most likely lost much of their possessions after Khosrow II&#x27;s execution in 628.

The empire was starting to look more like the Parthian feudal system before the fall of the Arsacid Empire. Yazdegerd, although being acknowledged as the rightful monarch by both the &quot;Parsig&quot; and &quot;Pahlav&quot; factions, does not seem to have held sway over all of his empire. Indeed, during the first years of his rule coins were only minted in Pars, Sakastan, and Khuzestan, approximately corresponding to the regions of the southwest (&quot;Xwarwarān&quot;) and southeast (&quot;Nēmrōz&quot;), where the &quot;Parsig&quot; was based. The &quot;Pahlav&quot;, who were mainly based in the northern portion of the empire, refused to mint coins of him. Even in the south Yazdegerd&#x27;s rule was not seemingly secure; a Sasanian claimant to the throne, Khosrow IV, minted coins at Susa in Khuzestan around this time, which he would do till 636. According to Rezakhani, Yazdegerd seemingly did not control Mesopotamia, including the capital of Ctesiphon. He argues that the conspiring aristocrats and the population of Ctesiphon, &quot;do not appear to have been too successful or eager in bringing Yazdgerd to the capital.&quot;

The empire was also at the same time invaded on all fronts; by the Göktürks in the east, and by Khazars in the west, who raided Armenia and Adurbadagan. The Sasanian army had been heavily weakened due to the war with the Byzantines and internal conflict. The circumstances were so chaotic, and the condition of the nation so alarming, that &quot;the Persians openly spoke of the imminent downfall of their empire, and saw its portents in natural calamities.&quot;

===Early clash with the Muslim Arabs===

In May 633, the Muslims defeated a Sasanian force under Azadbeh near the important strategic Sasanian city of Hira, which was shortly afterwards occupied. After the fall of Hira, Yazdegerd began to pay greater attention to the Muslims; Rostam Farrokhzad sent an army under the Persian military officer Bahman Jadhuyih and the Armenian military officer Jalinus against the Muslims. Rostam is known to have told Bahman secretly that: &quot;if Jalinus returns to the like of his defeat, then cut off his head.&quot; The Sasanian army managed to defeat the Muslims at the Battle of the Bridge.

In 636, Yazdegerd III ordered Rostam Farrokhzad to subdue the invading Arabs and then told him: &quot;Today you are the [most prominent] man among the Iranians. You see that the people of Iran have not faced a situation like this since the family of Ardashir I assumed power.&quot; Envoys then came to Yazdegerd III asking him to consider the dismissal of Rostam in order to replace him with someone around whom the people would rally.

Yazdegerd III asked Rostam for an assessment of the Arab forces since they had camped at Qadisiyyah. Rostam Farrokhzad stated that the Arabs were &quot;a pack of wolves, falling upon unsuspecting shepherds and annihilating them.&quot; Yazdegerd III responds to Rostam by saying

=== Last stand ===
However, the Sasanian army suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah, with Rostam, Bahman, Jalinus and two Armenian princes named Grigor II Novirak and Mushegh III Mamikonian being killed during the battle. The Arabs then marched towards the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon without meeting any resistance. Yazdegerd took his treasury, and along with 1,000 of his servants fled to Hulwan in Media, leaving Rostam Farrokhzad&#x27;s brother Farrukhzad in charge of Ctesiphon. Farrukhzad, however, did not attempt any resistance and also went to Hulwan. The Arabs subsequently reached Ctesiphon, besieged the western parts of the city, and soon occupied all of it. The Iranian defeat at the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah has often been described as a turning point in the Arab invasion of Iran. However, in reality, it was far from it. The battle served as a wake-up call for the Iranian armies, who became conscious that persistent factionalism could result in their inevitable destruction. Al-Tabari emphasizes this, stating that after the fall of Ctesiphon &quot;the people... were about to go their separate ways, they started to incite one another: &#x27;If you disperse now, you will never get together again; this is a spot that sends us in different directions&#x27;.&quot;

In April 637, the Arabs defeated another Sasanian army at the Battle of Jalula. After this defeat, Yazdegerd fled deeper into Media. He subsequently raised a new army and sent it to Nahavand to retake Ctesiphon and prevent any further Muslim advances. The army that Yazdegerd sent seemed such a serious threat that it led Umar to combine the Arab forces of Kufa and Basra under Al-Nu&#x27;man ibn Muqrin and send them against the Sasanians with reinforcements from Syria and Oman. The battle is said to have lasted several days. It resulted in major losses on both sides, including the death of al-Nu&#x27;man ibn Muqrin and the Iranian generals Mardanshah and Piruz Khosrow. The Battle of Nahavand in 642 was the second military disaster for the Sasanians after the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah.

===Flight===
After the Sasanian disaster, Yazdegerd fled to Isfahan, and raised a small army under a certain military officer named Siyah, who had lost his property to the Arabs. However, Siyah and the rest of the army mutinied against Yazdegerd, and agreed to help the Arabs in return for places to live. Meanwhile, Yazdegerd had arrived in Estakhr, where he tried organizing a base for resistance in the province of Pars. However, in 650, Abdullah ibn Aamir, the governor of Basra, invaded Pars and put an end to the Persian resistance. Estakhr was made into ruins after the battle and a force of 40,000 defenders including many Persian nobles were killed. After the Arab conquest of Pars, Yazdegerd fled to Kirman while being pursued by an Arab force. Yazdegerd managed to flee from the Arab force in a snowstorm at Bimand.

After arriving at Kirman, Yazdegerd became unfriendly with the &quot;marzban&quot; (general of a frontier province, &quot;margrave&quot;) of Kirman, and then left Kirman for Sakastan. Another Basran army later arrived which defeated and killed the &quot;marzban&quot; of Kirman in a bloody fight. When Yazdegerd arrived at Sakastan he lost the support of the governor of Sakastan by demanding tax from him. Yazdegerd then headed for Merv to join the leader of the Turks. However, when he arrived in Khorasan the inhabitants did not agree with Yazdegerd&#x27;s decision to continue waging war and told him that it was better if he made peace with the Arabs; Yazdegerd, however, refused. Sakastan was later taken by the Arab forces after a bloody fight around 650–652. Yazdegerd was also supported by the Principality of Chaghaniyan, which sent him troops to aid him against the Arabs. When Yazdegerd arrived in Marw (in what is today&#x27;s Turkmenistan) he demanded tax from the &quot;marzban&quot; of Marw, losing also his support and making him ally with Nezak Tarkan, the Hephthalite ruler of Badghis, who helped him defeat Yazdegerd and his followers.

====Chinese assistance====
After Yazdegerd III started to suffer from the onslaught of the Muslim Arabs, he soon sent an envoy to the Chinese court in 639 &quot;for offering tribute”. As he continued to suffer defeats from the Arabs, he again sent envoys to China, in 647 and 648, in order to “seek assistance from the Chinese court with the hope to form a new army&quot;. Some form of help would only arrive in 661, after Peroz III, the son of Yazdegerd, again sent envoys in 654 and 661. The Chinese established a &quot;Persian military commandery&quot; (波斯都督府) in the city of Zābol (疾陵城 &quot;Jilingcheng&quot;) in Tokharistan, and Peroz was appointed as Military Commander (都督 &quot;Dudu&quot;). Only in 679 would a Chinese army accompany Narsieh, the exiled son of Peroz, in order to restore him to the Sasanian throne, but the army stopped in Tokharistan and instead repelled the invasion of Western Turkic Khan Ashina Duzhi, leaving Narsieh to fight against the Muslim Arabs for the next twenty years.

===Death, legacy and personality===
After his defeat, Yazdegerd sought refuge at a miller near Marw, who, however, murdered him in 651. According to Kia, the miller had reportedly killed Yazdegerd in order to obtain his jewelry, whilst &quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot; states that the miller was sent by Mahoe Suri.

Regardless, the death of Yazdegerd marked the end of the Sasanian Empire, and made it less difficult for the Arabs to conquer the rest of Iran. All of Khorasan was soon conquered by the Arabs, who would use it as a base to attack Transoxiana. The death of Yazdegerd thus marked the end of the last pre-Islamic Iranian empire after more than 400 years of rule. An empire–which had a generation earlier briefly conquered Egypt and Asia Minor, even reaching as a far as Constantinople, fell to a force of lightly equipped Arabs that were used to skirmishes and desert warfare. The heavy Sasanian cavalry was too sluggish and systematized to contain them; employing light-armed Arab or East Iranian mercenaries from Khorasan and Transoxiana would have been much more successful.

Yazdegerd was according to tradition buried by Christian monks in a tall tomb that was situated in a garden decorated with silk and musk. His funeral and the construction of a mausoleum for his body near Merv was organized by the Nestorian bishop Elijah - in memory of the fact that the Shahanshah&#x27;s grandmother Shirin was a Christian. Mahoe, for his part in the murder of the Sassanian king, had his arms, legs, ears and nose cut off by the Turks, who eventually left him die under the scorching summer sun. The corpse of Mahoe was then burned at the stake, along with the bodies of his three sons.

The monks cursed Mahoe and made a hymn to Yazdegerd, mourning the fall of a &quot;combative&quot; king and the &quot;house of Ardashir I&quot;. Whether this event was factual or not, it emphasizes that the Christians of the empire remained loyal to the Zoroastrian Sasanians, even possibly more than the Iranian nobles who had deserted Yazdegerd. Indeed, there were close links between the late Sasanian rulers and Christians, whose conditions had greatly improved compared to that of the early Sasanian era. Yazdegerd&#x27;s wife was according to folklore a Christian, whilst his son and heir, Peroz III was seemingly an adherent of Christianity, and even had a church built in Tang China, where he had taken refuge. Yazdegerd became remembered in history as a martyred prince; many rulers and officers would later claim being a descendant of him in Islamic Iran.

Yazdegerd was well educated and cultured, but his arrogance, pride and inability to compare his demands with the real situation led to him constantly falling out with his governors and his influence diminishing as he, pursued by Arabs, moved from one city to another. At each new place, he behaved as if he was still the all-powerful monarch of the kingdom, and not an outcast running away from enemies, which, combined with his military failures, turned many of his most loyal subjects away from him.

==Zoroastrian calendar==
The Zoroastrian religious calendar, which is still in use today, uses the regnal year of Yazdegerd III as its base year, and its calendar era (year numbering system) is accompanied by a Y.Z. suffix.

Magians took Yazdegerd III&#x27;s death as the end of the millennium of Zoroaster and the beginning of the millennium of Oshedar.

<text>Balash (Middle Persian: 𐭥𐭥𐭣𐭠𐭧𐭱𐭩, ) was the Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 484 to 488. He was the brother and successor of Peroz I (), who had been defeated and killed by a Hephthalite army.

== Name ==
&quot;Balāsh&quot; () is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian &quot;Wardākhsh/Walākhsh&quot; (Inscriptional Pahlavi: wrdʾḥšy; late Book Pahlavi forms gwlḥš- &quot;Gulakhsh-&quot; and &quot;Gulāsh-&quot;). The etymology of the name is unclear, although Ferdinand Justi proposes that &quot;Walagaš&quot;, the first form of the name, is a compound of words &quot;strength&quot; (&quot;varəda&quot;), and &quot;handsome&quot; (&quot;gaš&quot; or &quot;geš&quot; in Modern Persian).

The Greek forms of his name are &quot;Blases&quot; () and &quot;Balas&quot; ().

== Reign ==
In 484, Peroz I () was defeated and killed by a Hephthalite army near Balkh. His army was completely destroyed, and his body was never found. Four of his sons and brothers had also died. The main Sasanian cities of the eastern region of Khorasan−Nishapur, Herat and Marw were now under Hephthalite rule. Sukhra, a member of the Parthian House of Karen, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, quickly raised a new force and stopped the Hephthalites from achieving further success. Peroz&#x27; brother, Balash, was elected as shah by the Iranian magnates, most notably Sukhra and the Mihranid general Shapur Mihran.

Immediately after ascending the throne, Balash sought peace with the Hephthalites, which cost the Sasanians a heavy tribute. Little is known about Balash, but he is perceived by eastern sources as a mild and tolerant ruler. He was very tolerant of Christianity, which earned him a reputation among Christian authors, who described him as a mild and generous monarch. Nevertheless, it would seem that Balash was only a nominee of the powerful nobleman and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler Sukhra.

At the announcement of the death of Peroz, the Iranian nobles of Sasanian Armenia, including the prominent nobleman Shapur Mihran, had become eager to go to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon to elect a new sovereign. This had allowed the Armenians under Vahan Mamikonian to proclaim independence from the Sasanians. Given the situation of the weakness in Iran, Balash did not send an army to fight the rebels, which forced him to conclude peace with the Armenians. The conditions of the peace were: all existing fire-altars in Armenia should be destroyed and no new ones should be constructed; Christians in Armenia should have freedom of worship and conversions to Zoroastrianism should be stopped: land should not be allotted to people who convert to Zoroastrianism; the Iranian shah should, in person, administer Armenia and through the aid of governors or deputies. In 485, Balash appointed Vahan Mamikonian as the &quot;marzban&quot; of Armenia. A few months later, a son of Peroz named Zarer rose in rebellion. Balash, with the aid of the Armenians, put down the rebellion, captured and killed him. In 488, Balash, who was an unpopular figure among the nobility and clergy, was deposed after a reign of just four years. Sukhra played a main role in Balash&#x27;s deposition, and appointed Peroz&#x27;s son Kavad as the new shah of Iran.

<text>Bahram I (also spelled Wahram I or Warahran I; ) was the fourth Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 271 to 274. He was the eldest son of Shapur I () and succeeded his brother Hormizd I (), who had reigned for a year.

Bahram I&#x27;s reign marked the end of the Sasanian tolerance towards Manichaeism, and in 274, with the support of the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir, he had Mani imprisoned and executed. Bahram I&#x27;s reign was brief and largely uneventful. He was succeeded by his son Bahram II.

== Name ==
The theophoric name &quot;Bahram&quot; () is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian &quot;Warahrān&quot; (also spelled &quot;Wahrām&quot;), which is derived from the Old Iranian &quot;Vṛθragna&quot;. The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the old Iranian god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was &quot;*Warθagn&quot;. The name is transliterated in Greek as &quot;Baranes&quot;, whilst the Armenian transliteration is &quot;Vahagn/Vrām&quot;. The name is attested in Georgian as &quot;Baram&quot; and Latin as &quot;Vararanes&quot;.

==Life prior to his accession==

Bahram I was the oldest son of Shapur I, the second shah of the Sasanian Empire. He had three younger brothers: Hormizd-Ardashir, Narseh, and Shapur Meshanshah. Although the oldest of Shapur&#x27;s sons, Bahram I was ranked below his brothers, probably due to his mother&#x27;s lowly origin: she was either a minor queen or a concubine. During Shapur&#x27;s reign, Bahram I served as the governor of the newly conquered region of Gilan, situated on the southwest shore of the Caspian Sea. He held the title of &quot;Gelan Shah&quot; (&quot;king of Gilan&quot;). He is mentioned in an inscription on the wall of the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht at Naqsh-e Rostam near Persepolis in southern Iran, which Shapur I had created in order to praise his sons by citing their names and titles.

Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by Hormizd-Ardashir (who became known as Hormizd I), who ruled from May 270 until his death in June 271. Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by his father, ascended with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir. He then made a settlement with Narseh, who agreed to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of Armenia, which was constantly the source of war between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. It is nevertheless likely that despite this settlement, Narseh still viewed Bahram as a usurper.

== Reign ==

The previous Sasanian shahs, including Shapur I, had pursued a policy of religious tolerance towards the non-Zoroastrian minorities in the empire. Although admiring the teachings of his own religion and encouraging the Zoroastrian clergy, Shapur I allowed the Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus to freely practice their own religions. He was also friendly towards Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, who was allowed to preach freely and even act as an escort in Shapur&#x27;s military expeditions. Following Bahram I&#x27;s accession to the throne, the rise of the authority of the Zoroastrian priesthood, and the increasing influence of Kartir, this changed. When Mani arrived at the city of Gundishapur there was uproar, in the same fashion as Jesus&#x27; entry into Jerusalem. After protests from Kartir and the other Zoroastrian priests, Bahram I was persuaded to imprison Mani, who was sentenced to death in 274.

Mani&#x27;s death was followed by the persecution of his followers by Kartir and the Zoroastrian clergy, who moved against the kingdom&#x27;s religious minorities as a way to increase and spread their influence. To the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani had been seen as a heterogeneous philosopher and a threatening pagan, who presented an obscure perception of Zoroastrianism that was tainted by Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian ideas. With the backing of Bahram I, Kartir laid the foundations for a Zoroastrian state church, which led to Bahram being applauded in Sasanian-based sources as a &quot;benevolent and worthy king&quot;. Bahram I was nevertheless, like his predecessors, a &quot;lukewarm Zoroastrian&quot;.

Bahram I died in September 274 and was succeeded by his son Bahram II. Another son of Bahram I, Hormizd I Kushanshah, ruled over the Kushano-Sasanian kingdom in the east, and would later lead a rebellion against Bahram II, which failed. The line of Bahram I continued to rule the Sasanian Empire until 293, when Narseh overthrew the latter&#x27;s grandson Bahram III and proclaimed himself the new shah. The line was thus shifted to Narseh and his descendants, who continued to rule the empire until its fall in 651.

== Coinage, appearance and habits ==
Under Bahram I, the reverse of coins were changed back to the version minted during the reign of Shapur I, with two attendants turning their backs to the fire altar, instead of facing it. The front of Bahram I&#x27;s coins shows him wearing the distinctive crown of the angelic divinity Mithra; a headgear decorated with ray-shaped spikes. A coin of Bahram was seemingly minted at Balkh in Bactria, which makes it the first imperial Sasanian coin (i.e. not Kushano-Sasanian) minted in the former domains of the Kushan Empire, and confirms direct Sasanian rule in the region under Bahram I. The lost &quot;Book of the Portraits of Sasanian Kings&quot; portrayed Bahram I as &quot;standing, holding a lance in the right hand and leaning upon a sword held in the left, and wearing a red gown and trousers and a gold crown topped with a sky-blue globe&quot;.

Bahram I was keen on combat, hunting and feasting, which he regarded as righteousness.

== Rock relief ==

Following the precedent of Ardashir I and Shapur I, Bahram I had an image of his accession carved in a rock relief. It displayed him on horseback, accepting the diadem of kingship from the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda, who is also depicted sitting on a horse. A Middle Persian inscription is written on the relief. According to the archaeologist Erich Schmidt, the relief is &quot;artistically the most appealing example of Sasanian rock sculpture&quot;. When Narseh ascended the throne in 293, he had the rock relief altered, replacing Bahram&#x27;s name with his own.

<doc id="140680" wikidata="Q299255" url="?curid=140680" title="Bahram II">
<text>Bahram II (also spelled Wahram II or Warahran II; ) was the fifth Sasanian King of Kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) of Iran, from 274 to 293. He was the son and successor of Bahram I (). Bahram II, while still in his teens, ascended the throne with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir, just like his father had done.

He was met with considerable challenges during his reign, facing a rebellion in the east led by his brother, the Kushano-Sasanian dynast Hormizd I Kushanshah, who also assumed the title of King of Kings and possibly laid claims to the Sasanian throne. Another rebellion, led by Bahram II&#x27;s cousin Hormizd of Sakastan in Sakastan, also occurred around this period. In Khuzestan, a Zoroastrian factional revolt led by a high-priest (&quot;mowbed&quot;) occurred. The Roman emperor Carus exploited the turbulent situation of Iran by launching a campaign into its holdings in Mesopotamia in 283. Bahram II, who was in the east, was unable to mount an effective coordinated defense at the time, possibly losing his capital of Ctesiphon to the Roman emperor. However, Carus died soon afterwards, reportedly being struck by lightning. As a result, the Roman army withdrew, and Mesopotamia was reclaimed by the Sasanians. By the end of his reign, Bahram II had made peace with the Roman emperor Diocletian and put an end to the disturbances in Khuzestan and the east. 

In the Caucasus, Bahram II strengthened Sasanian authority by securing the Iberian throne for Mirian III, an Iranian nobleman from the House of Mihran. Bahram II has been suggested by scholars to be the first Sasanian ruler to have coins minted of his family. He also ordered the carving of several rock reliefs that unambiguously emphasize distinguished representations of his family and members of the high nobility. He was succeeded by his son Bahram III, who after only four months of reign, was overthrown by Narseh, a son of the second Sasanian ruler, Shapur I ().

== Name ==
His theophoric name &quot;Bahram&quot; is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian &quot;Warahrān&quot; (also spelled &quot;Wahrām&quot;), which is derived from the Old Iranian &quot;Vṛθragna&quot;. The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the old Iranian god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was &quot;*Warθagn&quot;. The name is transliterated in Greek as &quot;Baranes&quot;, whilst the Armenian transliteration is &quot;Vahagn/Vrām&quot;. The name is attested in Georgian as &quot;Baram&quot; and Latin as &quot;Vararanes&quot;.

== Background ==

Bahram II was the eldest son of Bahram I (), the fourth king (shah) of the Sasanian dynasty, and the grandson of the prominent shah Shapur I (). The Sasanians had supplanted the Parthian Arsacid Empire as the sovereigns of Iran in 224, when Ardashir I (Bahram II&#x27;s great-grandfather) defeated and killed its last monarch Artabanus IV () at the Battle of Hormozdgan. A terminus post quem for Bahram II&#x27;s birth is , since that is the date of Shapur I&#x27;s inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht, which mentions the rest of the royal family but not him. His father, Bahram I, although the eldest son of Shapur I, was not considered a candidate for succession, probably due to his mother&#x27;s lowly origin. She was either a minor queen or perhaps even a concubine. Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by his son Hormizd I, who only reigned for a year before he died. Bahram I, with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir, ascended the throne. He then made a settlement with his brother Narseh to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of Armenia, which was constantly the source of conflict between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. Nevertheless, Narseh still most likely viewed Bahram I as a usurper.

== Governorship and accession ==

Bahram was briefly given the governorship of the southeastern provinces of Sakastan, Hind and Turgistan, which Narseh had previously governed. Sakastan was far away from the imperial court in Ctesiphon, and ever since its conquest the Sasanians had found it difficult to control. As a result, the province had since its early days functioned as a form of vassal kingdom, ruled by princes from the Sasanian family, who held the title of &quot;sakanshah&quot; (&quot;King of the Saka&quot;). Bahram I&#x27;s reign lasted briefly, ending in September 274 with his death. Bahram II, still in his teens, succeeded him as shah; he was probably aided by Kartir to ascend the throne instead of Narseh. This most likely frustrated Narseh, who held the title of &quot;Vazurg Šāh Arminān&quot; (&quot;Great King of Armenia&quot;), which was used by the heir to the throne.

Bahram II&#x27;s accession is mentioned in the narratives included in the history of the medieval Iranian historian al-Tabari;

==Reign==
===Wars===

Bahram II was met with considerable challenges during his reign. His brother Hormizd I Kushanshah, who governed the eastern portion of the empire (i.e., the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom), rebelled against him. Hormizd I Kushanshah was the first Kushano-Sasanian ruler to mint coins with the inscription of &quot;Hormizd, the Great Kushan King of Kings&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;Great Kushan King&quot; title. The Kushano-Sasanian king, now laying claims to the title of King of Kings, which had originally also been used by the Kushan Empire, displays a &quot;noteworthy transition&quot; (Rezakhani) in Kushano-Sasanian ideology and self-perception and possibly a direct dispute with the ruling branch of the Sasanian family. Hormizd I Kushanshah was supported in his efforts by the Sakastanis, Gilaks, and Kushans. Another revolt also occurred in Sakastan, led by Bahram II&#x27;s cousin Hormizd of Sakastan, who has been suggested to be the same person as Hormizd I Kushanshah. However, according to the Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani, this proposal must now be disregarded. At the same time, a revolt led by a high-priest (&quot;mowbed&quot;) occurred in the province of Khuzestan, which was seized by the latter for a period.

Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Carus, hearing of the civil war occurring in the Sasanian Empire, chose to take advantage of the situation by making a campaign into the empire in 283. He invaded Mesopotamia while Bahram II was in the east, and even besieged the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon without much fighting. The Sasanians, due to severe internal problems, were unable to mount an effective coordinated defense at the time; Carus and his army may have captured Ctesiphon. However, Carus briefly died afterwards, reportedly being struck by lightning. The Roman army as a result withdrew, and Mesopotamia was re-captured by the Sasanians.

=== Consolidation of the empire ===

The following year, Bahram II made peace with the new Roman emperor Diocletian, who was faced with internal issues of his own. The terms of the peace reportedly divided Armenia between the two empires, with Western Armenia being ruled by the pro-Roman Arsacid prince Tiridates III, and the remaining greater portion being kept by Narseh. However, this division is dismissed by the modern historian Ursula Weber, who argues that it conflicts with other sources, and that the Sasanians most likely kept control over Armenia until the later Peace of Nisibis (299). 

In the same year, Bahram II secured the Iberian throne for Mirian III, an Iranian nobleman from the House of Mihran, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. His motive was to strengthen Sasanian authority in the Caucasus and utilize the position of the Iberian capital Mtskheta as an entrance to the important passes through the Caucasus Mountains. This was of such importance to Bahram II that he allegedly went in person to Mtskheta in order to secure Mirian III&#x27;s position. He also sent one of his grandees named Mirvanoz (also a Mihranid) to the country in order to act as the guardian of Mirian III, who was then aged seven. After Mirian III&#x27;s marriage with Abeshura (daughter of the previous Iberian ruler Aspacures), 40,000 Sasanian &quot;select mounted warriors/cavalry&quot; were subsequently stationed in eastern Iberia, Caucasian Albania and Gugark. In western Iberia, 7,000 Sasanian cavalrymen were sent to Mtskheta to safeguard Mirian III.

By the time of Bahram II&#x27;s death in 293, the revolts in the east had been suppressed, with his son and heir Bahram III being appointed the governor of Sakastan, receiving the title of &quot;sakanshah&quot; (&quot;King of the Saka&quot;). Following Bahram II&#x27;s death, Bahram III, against his own will, was proclaimed shah in Pars by a group of nobles led by Wahnam and supported by Adurfarrobay, governor of Meshan. After four months of reigning, however, he was overthrown by Narseh, who had Wahnam executed. The line of succession was thus shifted to Narseh, whose descendants continued to rule the empire until its fall in 651.

==Relations with Kartir and religious policy==
Before Bahram II, the Sasanian shahs had been &quot;lukewarm Zoroastrians.&quot; He displayed a particular fondness to his name-deity by giving his son the name of Bahram, and by selecting the wings of the god&#x27;s bird, Verethragna, as the central component of his crown. Bahram II, like his father, received the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir well. He saw him as his mentor, and handed out several honors to him, giving him the rank of grandee (&quot;wuzurgan&quot;), and appointing him as the supreme judge (&quot;dadwar&quot;) of the whole empire, which implies that thenceforth priests were given the office of judge. Kartir was also appointed the steward of the Anahid fire-temple at Istakhr, which had originally been under the care of the Sasanian family. The Sasanian kings thus lost much of their religious authority in the empire. The clergy from now on served as judges all over the country, with court cases most likely being based on Zoroastrian jurisprudence, with the exception of when representatives of other religions had conflicts with each other.

It is thus under Bahram II that Kartir unquestionably becomes a powerful figure in the empire; the latter claimed on his inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht that he &quot;struck down&quot; the non-Zoroastrian minorities, such as the Christians, Jews, Mandaeans, Manichaeans, and Buddhists. According to the modern historian Parvaneh Pourshariati: &quot;it is not clear, however, to what extent Kartir&#x27;s declarations reflect the actual implementation, or for that matter, success, of the measures he is supposed to have promoted.&quot; Indeed, Jewish and Christian sources, for example, make no mention of persecutions during this period.

==Coins==

Starting with Bahram II, all the Sasanian shahs are portrayed with earrings on their coins. He is the first shah to have wings on his crown, which refers to the wings of the god&#x27;s bird, Verethragna. Like his predecessors (with the exception of Ardashir I and Shapur I, whose legends were slightly different), Bahram II&#x27;s legend on his coinage was &quot;the Mazda-worshiping, divine Bahram, King of Kings of Iran(ians) and non-Iran(ians), whose image/brilliance is from the gods.&quot;

Several coin types were minted during Bahram II&#x27;s reign; one type imitates him alone; another with him and a female figure; a third one with Bahram II and an unbearded youngster wearing a high tiara (known as a Median bonnet); and a fourth one shows Bahram II with the female figure and the unbearded youngster all together. The female figure is wearing different headdress on some of the coins, sometimes with a boar, griffin, horse or eagle. The precise meaning of these variations is unclear.

As the coins&#x27; legends contain no information regarding the status of these characters, it is difficult to analyze them. The unbearded youngster is usually understood as being the crown prince Bahram III, while the female figure is usually labelled as Bahram II&#x27;s queen Shapurdukhtak, who was his cousin. If the supposition is correct, this would make Bahram II the first (and last) shah to have coins minted of his family. According to the Iranologist Touraj Daryaee, &quot;this is an interesting feature of Bahram II in that he was very much concerned to leave a portrait of his family which incidentally gives us information about the court and the Persian concept of the royal banquet (&quot;bazm&quot;).&quot; The modern historian Jamsheed Choksy has attempted to establish that the female figure in reality illustrates the goddess Anahita, whilst the unbearded youngster illustrates Verethragna. The reverse shows the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants.
== Rock reliefs ==
Various rock reliefs were carved under Bahram II; one of them being at Guyom, 27 km northwest of Shiraz, where Bahram is portrayed standing alone. An additional relief at Sar Mashhad, south of Kazerun, portrays Bahram as a hunter: a dead lion reclines at his feet, and he thrusts his sword into a second lion as it attacks him. His queen Shapurdukhtak is holding his right hand in a signal of safeguard, whilst Kartir and another figure, most likely a prince, are watching. The scenery has been the subject of several symbolic and metaphorical meanings, thought it is most likely supposed to portray a simple royal display of braveness during a real-life hunt. An inscription of Kartir is underneath the relief. A third relief at Sarab-e Bahram, close to Nurabad, and 40 km north of Bishapur, portrays Bahram II facing, with Kartir and Papak, the governor of Iberia, to his left, and two other grandees to his right.
A fourth relief, at Bishapur, portrays Bahram mounted on a horse, whilst facing an Iranian grandee who is escorting a group of six men resembling Arabs in their clothing, arriving with horses and dromedaries. Apparently, it depicts the dimplomatic mission from the Himyarite king Shammar Yahri&#x27;sh at the beginning of his reign. A fifth relief, at Naqsh-e Rostam, portrays Bahram II standing whilst being surrounded by his family members and attendants; to his left are the sculptures of Shapurdukhtak, a prince, the crown prince Bahram III, Kartir, and Narseh. To his right are the sculptures of Papak, and two other grandees. 

A sixth relief, portraying an equestrian combat, was carved directly below the tomb of the Achaemenid King of Kings Darius the Great (). The relief has two panels. The top panel depicts Bahram II&#x27;s war against Carus, which he claims as a victory. The lower panel depicts Bahram II&#x27;s war with Hormizd I Kushanshah. A seventh relief, at Tang-e (or Sarab-e) Qandil, depicts a divine investiture scene, with Bahram II receiving a flower from Anahita. Bahram II also erected two rock reliefs in Barm-e Delak: the first depicts Bahram II giving a flower to Shapurdukhtak; the second depicts Bahram II making gesture of piety, whilst being offered a diadem by a courtier.

== Legacy ==
During the reign of Bahram II, art in Sasanian Iran flourished, notably in the portrayals of the shah and his courtiers. He is the first and only shah to have a woman illustrated on his coins, apart from the 7th-century Sasanian queen Boran (). The modern historian Matthew P. Canepa calls Bahram II a relatively weak shah, whose shortscomings allowed Kartir to take over some of the royal privileges. Military wise, however, Bahram II was more successful, putting an end to the disturbances in Khuzestan and the east, and repelling the Romans from Mesopotamia. According to Daryaee and Rezakhani, Bahram II&#x27;s reign &quot;appears to be one of stability and increasing introspection for the Sasanian administration.&quot;

<text>Bahram III (also spelled Wahram III or Warahran III; , New Persian: ), was the sixth king (shah) of the Sasanian Empire. He was son and successor of Bahram II. As a prelude to his kingship he was viceroy in the province of Sakastan, which had been re-conquered by his father sometime in the 280s.

Bahram III ascended to the throne after his father&#x27;s death in 293. Many nobles considered him too weak to rule, instead pledging allegiance to his grand-uncle Narseh. After reigning for a period of only four months, Bahram III was either captured or more likely killed during a campaign by Narseh, who took his place as king.

== Name ==
His theophoric name &quot;Bahram&quot; is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian &quot;Warahrān&quot; (also spelled &quot;Wahrām&quot;), which is derived from the Old Iranian &quot;Vṛθragna&quot;. The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the old Iranian god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was &quot;*Warθagn&quot;. The name is transliterated in Greek as &quot;Baranes&quot;, whilst the Armenian transliteration is &quot;Vahagn/Vrām&quot;. The name is attested in Georgian as &quot;Baram&quot; and Latin as &quot;Vararanes&quot;.

== Biography ==
In Sasanian Iran, it was customary for kings after conquering a land or people, to give their sons titles showing domination over them. Bahram III gained his title of &quot;sākān shāh&quot; presumably after his father&#x27;s victory over the Sakastan (present day Sistan) region. Also following early Sasanian practices of giving appanage of provinces to princes, Bahram III was appointed to Sakastan, a region of strategic importance in defending the eastern extremes of the kingdom.

Following the death of Bahram II in 293, Bahram III was proclaimed king in Pars by a group of nobles led by Wahnam and supported by Adurfarrobay, King of Meshan. He was still a minor at the time of his ascension, and many nobles (outside his core group of supporters) considered him too weak to properly handle the threat posed by the Romans and the possibility of invasion. They decided to challenge his succession to the throne and instead pledged allegiance to Narseh, the last remaining son of Shapur I, perceived as being a stronger leader and better able to bring glory to Iran.

Four months into Bahram&#x27;s reign, his grand-uncle Narseh was summoned to Mesopotamia at the request of many members of the Iranian nobility. He met them in the passage of Paikuli in the province of Garmekan, where he was firmly approved and likely also declared shah for the first time. The reasons behind the nobles favour of Narseh might have been due to his jurisdiction as governor, his image as an advocate of the Zoroastrian religion and as an insurer for harmony and prosperity of the empire. His ancestry from the early Sasanian family probably also played a role.

In order to avoid bloodshed, Narseh proposed to make peace with both Bahram III and Wahnam. Both seem to have agreed, as no accounts of battles have been made. The reason behind Bahram and Wahnam&#x27;s quick agreement to peace may have been due to desertion amongst many of Bahram&#x27;s men. Bahram abdicated as shah and was probably spared, whilst Wahnam was executed when Narseh entered the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Narseh then summoned the aristocrats to take part in the royal referendum, a ritual which had been used since the first Sasanian shah, Ardashir I (), and which Narseh now made use of in order to gain the approval of the aristocracy as a legitimate ruler instead that of a usurper. Narseh was decisively voted in favour by the majority, and guaranteed &quot;to enter the throne of our father and our forefathers with the help of the Gods, in their name and that of our forefathers.&quot;

== Artifacts ==
Many coins that could be attributed to him are small in number and due to uncertainty, many are often attributed to Narseh. Because many of the coins are attributed to him are smoother than usual the details of his crown are faint. It is believed that he is depicted wearing a gold crown with a crenellated lower rim and two large deer horns or at least replicas of them attached on each side. The Sasani sphere sits between the horns on the front of the crown.

A low relief at the Bishapur archeological site depicts a figure being trampled by a horse. It is assumed that this scene is a representation of either the death of Bahram III or more likely his ally Wahnam.

<text>Agathias Scholasticus (; 582/594) was a Greek poet and the principal historian of part of the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian I between 552 and 558.

== Biography ==
Agathias was a native of Myrina (Mysia), an Aeolian city in western Asia Minor. His father was Memnonius. His mother was presumably Pericleia. A brother of Agathias is mentioned in primary sources, but his name has not survived. Their probable sister Eugenia is known by name. The &quot;Suda&quot; clarifies that Agathias was active in the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian I, mentioning him as a contemporary of Paul the Silentiary, Macedonius of Thessalonica and Tribonian.

Agathias mentions being present in Alexandria as a law student at the time when an earthquake destroyed Berytus (Beirut). The law school of Berytus had been recognized as one of the three official law schools of the empire (533). Within a few years, as the result of the disastrous earthquake of 551, the students were transferred to Sidon. The dating of the event to 551: as a law student, Agathias could be in his early twenties, which would place his birth to .

He mentions leaving Alexandria for Constantinople shortly following the earthquake. Agathias visited the island of Kos, where &quot;he witnessed the devastation caused by the earthquake&quot;. At the fourth year of his legal studies, Agathias and fellow students Aemilianus, John and Rufinus are mentioned making a joint offering to Michael the Archangel at Sosthenium, where they prayed for a &quot;prosperous future&quot;.

He returned to Constantinople in 554 to finish his training, and practised as an advocatus (&quot;scholasticus&quot;) in the courts. John of Epiphania reports that Agathias practiced his profession in the capital. Evagrius Scholasticus and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos describe Agathias as a rhetor (&quot;public speaker&quot;). The &quot;Suda&quot; and a passage of John of Nikiû call him &quot;Agathias the scholastic&quot;. He is known to have served as pater civitatis (&quot;Father of the City&quot;, effectively a magistrate) of Smyrna. He is credited with constructing public latrines for the city. While Agathias mentions these buildings, he fails to mention his own role in constructing them.

Myrina is known to have erected statues to honor Agathias, his father Memnonius, and Agathias&#x27; unnamed brother. He seems to have been known to his contemporaries more as an advocatus and a poet. There are few mentions of Agathias as a historian.

Few details survive of his personal life – mainly in his extant poems. One of them tells the story of his pet cat eating his partridge. Another (Gr.Anth. 7.220) responds to his seeing the tomb of the courtesan Lais of Corinth, implying a visit to that city, which he refers to using the poetic name Ephyra. No full account of his life survives.

==Writings==
Literature, however, was Agathias&#x27; favorite pursuit, and he remains best known as a poet. Of his &quot;Daphniaca&quot;, a collection of short poems in hexameter on &#x27;love and romance&#x27; in nine books, only the introduction has survived. But he also composed over a hundred epigrams, which he published together with epigrams by friends and contemporaries in a &quot;Cycle of New Epigrams&quot; or &quot;Cycle of Agathias&quot;, probably early in the reign of emperor Justin II (r. 565–578). This work largely survives in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;—the edition by Maximus Planudes preserves examples not found elsewhere. Agathias&#x27;s poems exhibit considerable taste and elegance.

He also wrote marginal notes on the &quot;Description of Greece&quot; () of Pausanias.

===Histories===

Almost equally valued are Agathias&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, which he started in the reign of Justin II. He explains his own motivation in writing it, as simply being unwilling to let &quot;the momentous events of his own times&quot; go unrecorded. He credits his friends with encouraging him to start this endeavor, particularly one Eutychianus. This work in five books, &quot;On the Reign of Justinian&quot;, continues the history of Procopius, whose style it imitates, and is the chief authority for the period 552–558. It deals chiefly with the struggles of the Imperial army, under the command of general Narses, against the Goths, Vandals, Franks and Persians.

The work survives, but seems incomplete. Passages of his history indicate that Agathias had planned to cover both the final years of Justin II and the fall of the Huns but the work in its known form includes neither. Menander Protector implies that Agathias died before having a chance to complete his history. The latest event mentioned in the Histories is the death of the Persian king Khosrau I (r. 531–579); which indicates that Agathias was still alive in the reign of Tiberius II Constantine (r. 578–582). The emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) is never mentioned, suggesting that Agathias was dead by 582.

Menander Protector continued the history of Agathias, covering the period from 558 to 582. Evagrius Scholasticus alludes to Agathias&#x27; work, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to have had access to the full History.

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Agathias&#x27;s Histories &quot;abound in philosophic reflection. He is able and reliable, though he gathered his information from eye-witnesses, and not, as Procopius, in the exercise of high military and political offices. He delights in depicting the manners, customs, and religion of the foreign peoples of whom he writes; the great disturbances of his time, earthquakes, plagues, famines, attract his attention, and he does not fail to insert &quot;many incidental notices of cities, forts, and rivers, philosophers, and subordinate commanders.&quot; Many of his facts are not to be found elsewhere, and he has always been looked on as a valuable authority for the period he describes.&quot;

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;The author prides himself on his honesty and impartiality, but he is lacking in judgment and knowledge of facts; the work, however, is valuable from the importance of the events of which it treats&quot;.

Christian commentators note the superficiality of Agathias&#x27; Christianity: &quot;There are reasons for doubting that he was a Christian, though it seems improbable that he could have been at that late date a genuine pagan&quot; (&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;). &quot;No overt pagan could expect a public career during the reign of Justinian, yet the depth and breadth of Agathias&#x27; culture was not Christian&quot; (Kaldellis).

Agathias (&quot;Histories&quot; 2.31) is the only authority for the story of Justinian&#x27;s closing of the re-founded Platonic (actually neoplatonic) Academy in Athens (529), which is sometimes cited as the closing date of &quot;Antiquity&quot;. The dispersed neo-Platonists, with as much of their library as could be transported, found temporary refuge in the Persian capital of Ctesiphon, and afterwards— under treaty guarantees of security that form a document in the history of freedom of thought— at Edessa, which just a century later became one of the places where Muslim thinkers encountered ancient Greek culture and took an interest in its science and medicine.

Agathias&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; are also a source of information about pre-Islamic Iran, providing—in summary form—&quot;our earliest substantial evidence for the Khvadhaynamagh tradition&quot;, that later formed the basis of Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahname&quot; and provided much of the Iranian material for al-Tabari&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;.
Agathias recorded the earliest description of the rules of backgammon, which he calls &quot;τάβλη (tabula)&quot; as it is still called in Greece, in a story relating an unlucky game played by the emperor Zeno. Zeno had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two &quot;blots&quot;, checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.

<text>The &quot;Agosta&quot;-class submarine is a class of diesel-electric attack submarine developed and constructed by the French DCNS in the 1970s to succeed the submarines. The submarines have served in the French Navy as well as exported to the navies of Spain and Pakistan. It also used by Royal Malaysian Navy for the training purpose. They were replaced in French service by the nuclear attack submarines but are still in active service with the navies of Spain and Pakistan. The French Navy grouped this model of submarine in their most capable class as an &quot;océanique&quot;, meaning &quot;ocean-going.&quot;

The &quot;Agosta&quot; class is named for its lead unit, , which in turn was named for the Battle of Augusta () of 22 April 1676.

* PNS/M &quot;Hurmat&quot; (S136) – completed in 1980, originally named &quot;Adventurous&quot;

On 10 September 1974, South Africa announced to expand its submarine arm by entering in defence talks with France to acquire the &quot;Agosta-70&quot;-class submarines. South African Prime Minister P. W. Botha engaged in discussion with acquiring two &quot;Agosta-70&quot;-class submarines with French President Valéry d&#x27;Estaing, and had Capt. L. J. Woodburne as the project-manager of acquisition of &quot;Agosta-70&quot; program in South African Navy. Dubigeon-Normandie, the French contractor, built two Agosta-70 class submarine. However, France denied to order of delivery to South African Navy following the implementation of Resolution 418 (an arms embargo) by the United Nations.

The Agosta-70A class submarines were eventually offered to Pakistan, which Pakistan acquired for its military in 1978 and commissioned in Pakistan Navy in 1979. In Pakistan Navy, there are known as Hashmat Class.

In 1983–1985, the class of submarines were deployed in Arabian Sea to deter the actions of the larger Indian Navy in seaborne theatre. As part of the Cold War operation, they were deployed in the Arabian Sea and later embarked on being deployed on long-range mission to test depth and submerged endurance in Indian Ocean.

== Variants ==
The Agosta-90B-class submarines is an improved version with modern systems, better battery with longer endurance, deeper diving capability, lower acoustic cavitation and better automatic control (reducing crew from 54 to 36). It can be equipped with the MESMA air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. It is capable of carrying a combined load up to 16 torpedoes, SM39 Exocet, and seaborne nuclear cruise missiles.

The submarines were built through the technology transfer by France to Pakistan that resulted in complicated and lengthy negotiations between the Benazir Bhutto government and the Mitterrand administration in 1992, and signed with the Chirac administration in 1992. The &quot;Agosta–90B&quot;s were chosen over the British &quot;Upholder&quot;/&quot;Victoria&quot; class and the project was initially aimed at $520 million but the programme of technology transfer costed $950 million, for which France first provided loans that were paid in five to six years. In 2000, France gave Pakistan the licence to offer commercial production of the submarines to potential customers.

The SM39 was test-fired from a &quot;Khalid&quot;-class submarine in 2001.
* PNS/M &quot;Khalid&quot; (S137) – built in France by DCN Cherbourg, completed in 1999
* PNS/M &quot;Saad &quot; (S138) – assembled in Pakistan with French assistance, completed in 2002
* PNS/M &quot;Hamza&quot; (S139) – built in Pakistan with French assistance, commissioned 14 August 2006
In March 2018, DCNS, the original builder lost a bidding competition to the Turkish firm STM, for mid-life upgrades to the 3 class subs. The upgrades will replace &quot;the submarine’s entire sonar suite, periscope systems, command and control system, radar and electronic support systems. HAVELSAN- [Turkey’s state-controlled military software company] and ASELSAN [Turkish defense contractor]-made systems will also be exported as part of the project.” As well as install a &quot;SharpEye low probability-of-intercept (LPI) radar system aboard&quot; and &quot;make modifications on the pressure hull, the most critical structure in a submarine, by carrying out system-to-system and platform-to-system integrations for various systems, to be provided by local and foreign companies.”

<text>The Hundred Flowers Campaign, also termed the Hundred Flowers Movement () and the Double Hundred Movement (双百方针), was a period from 1956 to 1957 in the People&#x27;s Republic of China during which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by Mao Zedong, proposed to &quot;let one hundred flowers bloom in social science and arts and let one hundred points of view be expressed in the field of science.&quot; It was a campaign that allowed citizens to offer criticism and advice to the government and the party; hence it was intended to serve an antibureaucratic purpose, at least on the Maoists&#x27; part. The campaign resulted in a groundswell of criticism aimed at the Party and its policies by those outside its rank and represented a brief period of relaxation in ideological and cultural control.

The movement was in part a response to tensions between the CCP and Chinese intellectuals. Mao had realized that the CCP&#x27;s control over intellectual life was stifling potentially useful new ideas. He was also worried about the emergence of new party elites who could threaten his position. He sought to use the movement to restrain the new forces within the party. However, criticism quickly grew out of hand and posed a threat to the communist regime. The liberation was short-lived. Afterwards, a crackdown continued through 1957 and 1959, developing into an Anti-Rightist Campaign against those who were critical of the regime and its ideology. Citizens were rounded up in waves by the hundreds of thousands, publicly criticized during struggle sessions, and condemned to prison camps for re-education through labor or execution. The ideological crackdown re-imposed Maoist orthodoxy in public expression, and catalyzed the Anti-Rightist Movement.

==The campaign==
=== Naming ===
The name of the movement consists two parts. The first part &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom&quot; (百花齊放) is originated from a novel named &quot;Flowers in the Mirror&quot; by Qing Author Li Ruzhen; the second part &quot;Let a hundred schools of thoughts contend&quot; (百家爭鳴) comes from &quot;Treatise on Literature&quot; of the Book of Han authored by the Chinese historian Ban Gu:

The slogan was first used by Mao Zedong on May 2, 1956, during a public speech. The name was used to arouse the interest of China&#x27;s intellectuals, referring to the Warring States period when numerous schools of thought competed for ideological, not military, supremacy. Historically, Confucianism, Chinese Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism had gained prominence, and socialism would now face its test. At the time, the movement was opposed by even some of Mao&#x27;s most devout followers, as well as some within the academic circle, most notably, Guo Moruo.

=== Launch (late 1956–early 1957) ===
In March 1951, the Peking Opera Research Institute was considered to be expanded and established as the Chinese Opera Research Institute. Mao was invited to inscribe a dedication for the institute. Meanwhile, half of the people argued that Peking Opera is outdated and that revolutionary opera should be promoted. In late March, Mao inscribed a dedication for the establishment of the Chinese Opera Research Institute: &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom; weed through the old to bring forth the new.&quot; In 1953, Boda Chen, who was in charge of the Committee for the Study of Chinese Historical Issues, sought Mao&#x27;s guidance on the work principles, to which Chairman Mao responded with four characters: &quot;Let a hundred schools of thought contend.&quot; Until April 28, 1956, in his concluding speech at an expanded meeting of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, he mentioned, &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend&quot; in first time. It is suggested that the launching of the campaign was delayed by the shocking impact of the speech denouncing Stalin at the Twentieth Soviet Party Congress in February 1956 delivered by Nikita Khrushchev. 

In the opening stage of the movement, during March and April, issues discussed were relatively minor and unimportant in the grand scheme. Emphasis was placed on a distinction being drawn between &quot;friend and foe&quot;. Intellectuals approached the campaign with suspicion, due to a lack of guidelines on what speech was acceptable; few also had suspicions about whether the campaign was bait, and whether disallowed speech would get them in trouble. Resultantly, the Central Government did not receive much criticism, although there was a significant rise in letters of conservative advice. Premier Zhou Enlai received some of these letters, and once again realized that, although the campaign had gained notable publicity, it was not progressing as had been hoped. Zhou approached Mao about the situation, stating that more encouragement was needed from the central bureaucracy to lead the intellectuals into further discussion. Mao Zedong found the concept interesting and superseded Zhou to take control. Guo Moruo declared that the contending of diverse schools should be guided by the central aim of building a socialist society.

The idea was to have intellectuals discuss the country&#x27;s problems to promote new forms of arts and new cultural institutions. Mao also saw this as the chance to promote socialism, believing that after discussion it would be apparent that socialist ideology was the dominant ideology over capitalism, even amongst non-communist Chinese, and would thus propel the development and spread of the goals of socialism. To this end, in an attempt to reduce hesitancy, intellectuals were invited to forums in which they were allowed to ask exploratory questions, slowly discovering what was deemed acceptable speech. During this time, criticisms were often indirect and lauded the Hundred Flowers campaign itself. In Leknor&#x27;s research, it is stated that the conventional understanding of communication and power is inverted during the campaign since the right to speak up and be heard was not the right resevered for those in powers, but the right to keep one&#x27;s voice out of the unfolding campaign. In other words, students were pressured by teachers to speak out; inferiors were asked to speak by superiors. 

Criticisms became more specific in May, citing the regimentation of education, thought reforms in previous years that were described as &quot;painful&quot;, and the lack of employment prospects for those who went to American and British scholars. Additionally, some recanted their self-criticism and confessions from previous years.

=== Escalation of Criticism (Spring 1957) ===
By the spring of 1957, Mao had announced that criticism was &quot;preferred&quot; and had begun to mount pressure on those who did not turn in healthy criticism on policy to the Central Government. The reception was immediate with intellectuals, who began voicing concerns without any taboo. In the period from 1 May to 7 June that year, millions of letters were pouring into the Premier&#x27;s Office and other authorities.

From May to June 1957, newspapers published a huge range of critical articles. The majority of these critiques argued that the Party had become less revolutionary and more bureaucratic. Nonetheless, most of the commentary was premised on complete acceptance of socialism and the legitimacy of the Communist Party and focused on making the existing socialist system work better.

Criticism increasingly arose from Chinese citizens of varying backgrounds. Peasants criticized the effectiveness of cooperatives and demanded the repossession of their land. Workers argued that the wage system was irrational and complained about the requirement to work overtime without pay. Some individuals even argued that the people were better off under the administration of the KMT. There was even advocation by ethnic minorities within the China to separate from the nation to form independent states.

Others spoke out by putting up posters around campuses, rallying in the streets, holding meetings for CPC members, and publishing magazine articles. A journalist wrote that the party became alienated from the masses and that its members had become &quot;flatterers, sycophants, and yes-men.&quot; One professor mentioned that Marx and Lenin had repeatedly revised their theories and suggested that the two would be displeased if they had seen how strictly the CCP leaders were applying doctrine. Notably, students at Peking University created a &quot;Democratic Wall&quot; on which they criticized the CCP with posters and letters. They protested CPC control over intellectuals, the harshness of previous mass campaigns such as that against counter-revolutionaries, the slavish following of Soviet models, the low standards of living in China, the proscription of foreign literature, economic corruption among party cadres, and the fact that &#x27;Party members [enjoyed] many privileges which make them a race apart&#x27;.

==Effects of the campaign==
On June 8, 1957, the major party newspaper, &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, published an editorial that signaled the conclusion of the Hundred Flowers Campaign. The editorial asserted that &quot;rightists&quot; had exploited the new found freedom to attack the party and undermine the revolution. This, the editorial claimed, amounted to a hostile struggle &quot;between the enemy and the people&quot;, indicating the beginning of a crackdown that later became the Anti-Rightist Campaign led by then party General Secretary Deng Xiaoping. Mao announced that &quot;poisonous weeds&quot; had grown amongst the &quot;fragrant flowers&quot; of the campaign, further terminology which signified the impeding crackdown. 

In a revised version of &quot;On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People&quot;, an essay aimed to revive the Hundred Flowers campaign published on June 19 1957, Mao Zedong clarified the distinction between &quot;beautiful flowers&quot; and &quot;poisonous weeds&quot;;
# Whether they would help to unite the people of various nationalities.
# Whether they were beneficial or harmful to socialism.
# Whether they would consolidate or weaken the people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship.
# Whether they would consolidate democratic centralism.
# Whether they would strengthen or weaken the leadership of the Communist Party of China.
# Whether they would strengthen our &quot;international socialist solidarity&quot;. Later in this version of the speech, &quot;international socialist solidarity&quot; was defined as &quot;To strengthen our solidarity with the Soviet Union, to strengthen our solidarity with all socialist countries - this is our fundamental policy, herein lies our basic interest.&quot;

In July 1957, Mao ordered a halt to the campaign. Unexpected demands for power sharing led to the abrupt change of policy. By that time, Mao had witnessed Nikita Khrushchev denouncing Joseph Stalin and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, events which he felt were threatening. In essence, Mao was threatened by the intellectuals efforts to reclaim the position as loyal guardians of the proper moral framework for the political system.

The campaign made a lasting impact on Mao&#x27;s ideological perception. Mao, who is known historically to be more ideological and theoretical, less pragmatic and practical, continued to attempt to solidify socialist ideals in future movements in a more pragmatic manner, and in the case of the Cultural Revolution, employed more violent means. Another consequence of the Hundred Flowers Campaign was that it discouraged dissent and made intellectuals reluctant to criticize Mao and his party in the future. The Anti-Rightist Movement that shortly followed, and was caused by the Hundred Flowers Campaign, resulted in the persecution of intellectuals, officials, students, artists, and dissidents labeled &quot;rightists&quot;. The campaign led to a loss of individual rights, especially for any Chinese intellectuals educated in Western centers of learning. The campaign was conducted indiscriminately, as numerous individuals were labeled as &quot;rightists&quot; based on anonymous denunciations. Local officials across the country were even assigned quotas for the number of &quot;rightists&quot; they needed to identify and denounce within their units. In the summer and early fall of 1957, roughly four hundred thousand urban residents, including many intellectuals, were branded as rightists and either sent to penal camps or forced into labor in the countryside. While the party attempted to improve relations with intellectuals at the end of the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution obliterated any semblance of intellectual influence and prestige, &quot;very few, if any, intellectuals survived the Cultural Revolution without having suffered physical and psychological abuse&quot;.

The Hundred Flowers Movement was the first of its kind in the history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in that the government opened up to ideological criticisms from the general public. Although its true nature has always been questioned by historians, it can be generally concluded that the events that took place alarmed the central communist leadership. The movement also represented a pattern that has emerged from Chinese history wherein free thought is promoted by the government, and then suppressed by it. A similar surge in ideological thought would not occur again until the late 1980s, leading up to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The latter surge, however, did not receive the same amount of government backing and encouragement.

Another important issue of the campaign was the tension that surfaced between the political center and national minorities. With criticism allowed, some of the minorities&#x27; activists made public their protest against &quot;Han chauvinism&quot; which they saw the informal approach of party officials toward the local specifics.

The prominent party figures&#x27; attitudes toward the campaign is also a prime example of divided opinion on leadership level within the party on the issue of corruption among the party officials. As Lieberthal puts it, &quot;The Chairman…in the Hundred Flowers campaign and in the Cultural Revolution, proved willing to bring in non-party people as part of his effort to curb officiousness by cadres. Other leaders, such as Liu Shaoqi, opposed &quot;rectifying&quot; the party by going outside of its ranks.&quot;

== Debated intention of the campaign ==
Historians debate whether Mao&#x27;s motivations for launching the campaign were genuine. Some find it possible that Mao originally had pure intentions, but later decided to utilize the opportunity to destroy criticism. Historian Jonathan Spence suggests that the campaign was the culmination of a muddled and convoluted dispute within the Party regarding how to address dissent.

Authors Clive James and Jung Chang posit that the campaign was, from the start, a ruse intended to expose rightists and counter-revolutionaries, and that Mao Zedong persecuted those whose views were different from those of the Party. The first part of the phrase from which the campaign takes its name is often remembered as &quot;let a hundred flowers bloom.&quot; This is used to refer to an orchestrated campaign to flush out dissidents by encouraging them to show themselves as critical of the regime, and then subsequently imprison them, according to Chang and James.

In &quot;&quot; by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Chang asserts that &quot;Mao was setting a trap, and...was inviting people to speak out so that he could use what they said as an excuse to victimise them.&quot; Prominent critic Harry Wu, who as a teenager was a victim, later wrote that he &quot;could only assume that Mao never meant what he said, that he was setting a trap for millions.&quot;

One supposedly authentic letter written by Mao indicates that the campaign was a ploy for entrapment from the beginning. Circulated to higher party cadres in mid-May 1957, the letter stated:Things are just beginning to change. The rightist offensive has not yet reached its peak. [The rightists] are still very enthusiastic. We want to let them rage for a while and climb to the very summit.

Mao&#x27;s personal physician, Li Zhisui, suggested that:[The campaign was] a gamble, based on a calculation that genuine counter-revolutionaries were few, that rebels like Hu Feng had been permanently intimidated into silence, and that other intellectuals would follow Mao&#x27;s lead, speaking out only against the people and practices Mao himself most wanted to subject to reform.Indeed, Mao responded to the accusation in July 1, 1956 editorial of People&#x27;s Press: Some say this is a conspiracy. We say this is an open strategy. Because we informed the enemy in advance: only by allowing the monsters and demons to come out of their lairs can we exterminate them; only by letting the poisonous weeds emerge from the ground can we easily uproot them. Don&#x27;t farmers weed several times a year? Weeds, once removed, can still be used as fertilizer. Class enemies will inevitably seek opportunities to express themselves. They are unwilling to accept the downfall of the nation and the rise of communism.Professor Lin Chun characterizes as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; the depiction of the Hundred Flowers campaign as a calculated trap. In her analysis, this depiction is disputed by empirical research from archival sources and oral histories. She writes that many interpretations of the Hundred Flowers campaign &quot;underestimate the fear on the part of Mao and party leadership over an escalating atmosphere of anticommunism within the communist world in the aftermath of the East European uprisings.&quot;

Author Christine Vidal similarly rejects the idea of the campaign as being initially calculated to lure dissidents for later repression, stating that &quot;the repression was not the initial aim of Mao and of his Hundred Flowers policy.&quot;

== Aftermath ==

=== CCP&#x27;s internal perception towards the campaign ===
The party&#x27;s internal attitude towards the campaign can be found in &quot;Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party since the Founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China:&quot;The economic task in 1957, due to the serious implementation of the correct policies of the Party&#x27;s &quot;Eighth National Congress&quot;, was one of the most effective years since the founding of the country. This year, the entire Party launched the Rectification Campaign, mobilizing the masses to criticize and offer suggestions to the Party. This was a normal step in promoting socialist democracy. During the Rectification process, a very small number of bourgeois rightists took the opportunity to advocate for so-called &quot;big revelations and big debates&quot;, launching a brazen attack on the Party and the new socialist system, attempting to replace the leadership of the Communist Party. It was entirely correct and necessary to firmly counteract this attack. However, the Anti-Rightist Campaign was seriously expanded, misclassifying a group of intellectuals, patriots, and Party cadres as &quot;rightists&quot;, resulting in unfortunate consequences.

<doc id="140696" wikidata="Q313644" url="?curid=140696" title="Bahram IV">
<text>Bahram IV (also spelled Wahram IV or Warahran IV; ), was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 388 to 399. He was likely the son and successor of Shapur III ().

Before his accession to the throne, Bahram served as governor of the southeastern province of Kirman. There he bore the title of (meaning &quot;king of Kirman&quot;), which would serve as the name of the city he later founded in western Iran.

His reign as was largely uneventful. In Armenia, he deposed his insubordinate vassal Khosrov IV and installed the latter&#x27;s brother Vramshapuh on the Armenian throne. In 395, the Huns invaded the countryside around the Euphrates and the Tigris, but were repelled. It was under Bahram IV that the use of mint signatures became regular, with several new mints established in his empire. Like his father, Bahram IV was killed by the nobility; he was succeeded by his brother Yazdegerd I.

He is notable for being portrayed on two seals, one during his tenure as ; and the other as .

== Name ==
His theophoric name &quot;Bahram&quot; is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian (also spelled ), which is derived from the Old Iranian . The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the old Iranian god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was . The name is transliterated in Armenian as , whilst the Greek transliteration is . The name is attested in Georgian as &quot;Baram&quot; and Latin as &quot;Vararanes&quot;.

==Early life==
According to the medieval historian al-Tabari (d. 923), Bahram was the son of Shapur II (). However, several other historians, such as Hamza al-Isfahani (d. after 961), state that he was the son of Shapur III (), which is thought to be more likely. Bahram, during the reign of his father, was the governor of the southeastern province of Kirman, and may have built the town of Shiragan, which would serve as the capital of the province for the remainder of the Sasanian period. The town played an important economic role, serving as a mint city. The district it governed was an important agricultural region. According to the medieval geographer Yaqut (d. 1229), Bahram had buildings constructed in the city of Veh-Ardashir. Like many other governors of Kirman, Bahram bore the title of (meaning &quot;king of Kirman&quot;), which would serve as the name of the city he later founded in western Iran. In 388, Bahram succeeded his father, who had been killed by a party of Iranian nobles.

==Reign==

During the reign of Shapur III, an agreement was made between Iran and Rome to partition Kingdom of Armenia. The boundary stretched through Theodosiopolis in the north and Amida in the south, which meant that most of Armenia remained in Sasanian hands. When this treaty exactly took place is unsure; most scholars believe the treaty was made in 387. The pro-Roman king Arshak III () of the Arsacid dynasty soon died, which made the Romans abolish their branch of the Arsacid monarchy and create the province of Western Armenia. The Arsacid monarchy in the Iranian part of Armenia (which became known as Persarmenia) was maintained, with Khosrov IV ruling the country as a Sasanian vassal. Bahram IV began to distrust Khosrov IV, which eventually resulted in Khosrov IV&#x27;s removal and the succession of his brother Vramshapuh. The immediate cause of Khosrov IV&#x27;s removal may have been his appointment of Sahak as the patriarch of Persarmenia without consulting the Iranian court.

In 395, the Huns invaded the Roman provinces of Sophene, Western Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Cappadocia. They reached as far Galatia, taking many captives. They then invaded the Iranian realm, devastating much of the countryside around the Euphrates and the Tigris. A counterattack was soon made, which resulted in the defeat of Hunnic forces and the retrieval of their spoils. Bahram IV allowed the Roman captives to stay at Veh-Ardashir and Ctesiphon, where they were given rations, which included bread, wine and oil. Most of the captives were later returned to their own lands. These Hunnic invasions signaled to the Sasanians that areas of Iran that lacked natural defenses had to be better secured.

In 399, Bahram IV was killed by an arrow during a hunting expedition. The 9th-century historian Dinawari calls the incident an accident, while al-Tabari calls the perpetrators &quot;a group of murderous evildoers&quot;. Modern scholarship agrees that the nobility was behind the murder. According to the modern historian Scott McDonough, Bahram IV was killed for his attempt to reduce the authority of the powerful Parthian noble families (known as the ) who formed the bulk of the Iranian feudal army. Centered on the Iranian plateau, they were largely autonomous. Attempts to curb their authority usually resulted in the &#x27;s murder. Ultimately, the Parthian nobility worked for the for personal benefit, personal oath, and, conceivably, a common awareness of the &quot;Aryan&quot; (Iranian) kinship they shared with their Persian overlords. Bahram IV was succeeded by his brother Yazdegerd I, who, aware of the previous actions of the nobility, strived to restrict their power.

== Personality ==
The assessment of Arabic sources towards Bahram IV is mixed, although he is generally portrayed in a positive light. According to al-Tabari &quot;he governed his subjects in commendable fashion and was praised for his rule&quot;. The 9th-century scholar Ibn Qutaybah mentions &quot;his pursuit of justice and good rule&quot;. Hamza al-Isfahani calls him a &quot;proud but harsh ruler, who neglected his subjects&quot;. The 12th-century historian Ibn al-Balkhi, however, calls him a &quot;self-absorbed king who never held &quot;mazalim&quot;&quot;.

== Coinage ==

On his coinage, Bahram IV is portrayed wearing a crown with wings—a reference to Verethragna. The wings are attached to a mural crown, which was a symbol of the supreme god in Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda. Bahram IV was the first Sasanian monarch to combine two religious components on his crown. Afterwards such crowns became a common feature among the Sasanians. It was also under him that the use of mint signatures became regular. The regularization of mint signatures allows the origin of coins to be more easily identified. Under Bahram IV, the eastern province of Abarshahr produced its largest proportion of coinage (19%) throughout Sasanian history. The large production of coins in the region was to meet the expenditure needed to maintain the large number of troops stationed there.

Like Shapur II, Ardashir II and Shapur III, Bahram IV also minted unique gold coins in the Indian region of Sindh, which may have corresponded to the Sasanian province of Hind. Under Bahram IV, mints were established in the cities of Gundeshapur and Susa in Khuzistan. A mint was also established in the northwestern province of Adurbadagan to support the construction of the Caspian Gates to protect the Caucasus border against Hunnic incursions.

== Seals ==

A seal of Bahram during his tenure as has survived. Written in Middle Persian, its inscription says the following; &quot;Wahrān Kermān Šāh, son of the Mazdā-worshipping Lord Šāpūr, king of kings of Iran and non-Iran, who is a scion of lords&quot;. In addition to that, another seal of Bahram IV has been found dating from his rule as . This seal, currently located in the British Museum, portrays him with his characteristic crown. He is holding a javelin and standing on the body of an unknown fallen foe. This fallen foe resembles the same figure portrayed on the rock relief of Ardashir II, which most likely depicted the Roman emperor Julian, who fell in battle against the Sasanians in 363. It has been suggested that the figure on Bahram IV&#x27;s seal may have been Julian as well, added by Bahram IV to emphasize his own legitimacy and ability through his supposed participation in the formers defeat.

<doc id="140697" wikidata="Q1330003" url="?curid=140697" title="Torpedo tube">
<text>A torpedo tube is a cylindrical device for launching torpedoes.

There are two main types of torpedo tube: underwater tubes fitted to submarines and some surface ships, and deck-mounted units (also referred to as torpedo launchers) installed aboard surface vessels. Deck-mounted torpedo launchers are usually designed for a specific type of torpedo, while submarine torpedo tubes are general-purpose launchers, and are often also capable of deploying mines and cruise missiles. Most modern launchers are standardized on a diameter for light torpedoes (deck mounted aboard ship) or a diameter for heavy torpedoes (underwater tubes), although torpedoes of other classes and diameters have been used.

==Submarine torpedo tube==
A submarine torpedo tube is a more complex mechanism than a torpedo tube on a surface ship, because the tube has to accomplish the function of moving the torpedo from the normal atmospheric pressure within the submarine into the sea at the ambient pressure of the water around the submarine. Thus a submarine torpedo tube operates on the principle of an airlock.

===Torpedo tube operation===
The diagram illustrates the operation of a submarine torpedo tube. The diagram is somewhat simplified but does show the working of a submarine torpedo launch.

A torpedo tube has a considerable number of interlocks for safety reasons. For example, an interlock prevents the breech door and muzzle door from opening at the same time.

The submarine torpedo launch sequence is, in simplified form:


#Open the breech door in the torpedo room. Load the torpedo into the tube.
#Hook up the wire-guide connection and the torpedo power cable.
#Shut and lock the breech door.
#Turn on power to the torpedo. A minimum amount of time is required for torpedo warmup. Fire control programs are uploaded to the torpedo.
#Flood the torpedo tube. This may be done manually or automatically, from sea or from tanks, depending on the class of submarine. The tube must be vented during this process to allow for complete filling and eliminate air pockets which could escape to the surface or cause damage when firing.
#Open the equalizing valve to equalize pressure in the tube with ambient sea pressure.
#Open the muzzle door. If the tube is set up for Impulse Mode the slide valve will open with the muzzle door. If Swim Out Mode is selected, the slide valve remains closed. The slide valve allows water from the ejection pump to enter the tube.
#When the launch command is given and all interlocks are satisfied, the water ram operates, thrusting a large volume of water into the tube at high pressure, which ejects the torpedo from the tube with considerable force. Modern torpedoes have a safety mechanism that prevents activation of the torpedo unless the torpedo senses the required amount of G-force.
#The power cable is severed at launch. However, if a guidance wire is used, it remains connected through a drum of wire in the tube. Torpedo propulsion systems vary but electric torpedoes swim out of the tube on their own and are of a smaller diameter. Torpedoes with diameter and fuel-burning engines usually start outside the tube.
#Once outside the tube the torpedo begins its run toward the target as programmed by the fire-control system. Attack functions are programmed but with wire guided weapons, certain functions can be controlled from the ship.
#For wire-guided torpedoes, the muzzle door must remain open because the guidance wire is still connected to the inside of the breech door to receive commands from the submarine&#x27;s fire-control system. A wire cutter on the inside of the breech door is activated to release the wire and its protective cable. These are drawn clear of the ship prior to shutting the muzzle door.
#The drain cycle is a reverse of the flood cycle; water is returned to the boat&#x27;s tanks and can be moved as necessary. The tube must be vented to completely drain the tube since it is usually by gravity.
#Open the breech door and remove the remnants of the torpedo power cable and the guidance wire basket. The tube must be wiped dry to prevent a buildup of slime. This process is called &quot;diving the tube&quot; and tradition dictates that &quot;ye who shoots, dives&quot;.
#Shut and lock the breech door.

Spare torpedoes are stored behind the tube in racks.

Speed is a desirable feature of a torpedo loading system, but safety is paramount. There are various manual and hydraulic handling systems for loading torpedoes into the tubes. Prior to the , US SSBNs utilized manual block and tackle which took about 15 minutes to load a tube. SSNs prior to the used a hydraulic system that was much faster and safer in conditions where the ship needed to maneuver.
The German Type 212 submarine uses a new development of the water ram expulsion system, which ejects the torpedo with water pressure to avoid acoustic detection.

<doc id="140698" wikidata="Q299271" url="?curid=140698" title="Bahram V">
<text>Bahram V (also spelled Wahram V or Warahran V; ), also known as Bahram Gur (New Persian: , &quot;Bahram the onager [hunter]&quot;), was the Sasanian King of Kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) from 420 to 438.

The son of the incumbent Sasanian shah Yazdegerd I (), Bahram was at an early age sent to the Lahkmid court in al-Hira, where he was raised under the tutelage of the Lakhmid kings. After the assassination of his father, Bahram hurried to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon with a Lakhmid army, and won the favour of the nobles and priests, according to a long-existing popular legend, after withstanding a trial against two lions.

Bahram V&#x27;s reign was generally peaceful, with two brief wars—first against his western neighbours, the Eastern Roman Empire, and then against his eastern neighbours, the Kidarites, who were disturbing the Sasanian eastern provinces. It was also during his reign that the Arsacid line of Armenia was replaced by a &quot;marzban&quot; (governor of a frontier province, &quot;margrave&quot;), which marked the start of a new era in Armenia, known in Armenian historiography as the &quot;Marzpanate period&quot;.

Bahram V is a central figure in several of the most famous works in Persian literature. He is mentioned in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;) written between 977 and 1010, and he is the protagonist of Nizami Ganjavi&#x27;s romantic epic &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; (also known as the &quot;Bahramnameh&quot;), written in 1197. &quot;The Seven Beauties&quot; were princesses, which—in Nizami&#x27;s imagination—became Bahram&#x27;s wives and each received her own residence in his palace. He visited them on a rotating basis, and they entertained him with exciting stories. He is also the focal point in the Hasht-Behesht (&quot;Eight Paradises&quot;), written by Amir Khusrau in ca. 1302.

Bahram V is remembered as one of the most famous kings in Iranian history, due to his cancellation of taxes and public debt at celebratory events, his encouragement of musicians, and his enjoyment of hunting. He was succeeded by his son Yazdegerd II ().

== Name ==
His theophoric name &quot;Bahram&quot; is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian &quot;Warahrān&quot; (also spelled &quot;Wahrām&quot;), which is derived from the Old Iranian &quot;Vṛθragna&quot;. The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the old Iranian god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was &quot;*Warθagn&quot;. The name is transliterated in Greek as &quot;Baranes&quot;, whilst the Armenian transliteration is &quot;Vahagn/Vrām&quot;. The name is attested in Georgian as &quot;Baram&quot; and Latin as &quot;Vararanes Gororanes&quot;.

== Early life and rise to power ==
Bahram V was born around 400; according to folklore, he was born in Rusan, close to the city of Spahan. He was the son of shah Yazdegerd I () and Shushandukht, a daughter of the Jewish exilarch. Richard Frye believes that Yazdegerd I&#x27;s marriage to a daughter of the patriarch of the Jews is &quot;probably folk tales&quot;, while Touraj Daryaee supports this story, stating that the Jews would see Bahram as a Jewish king due to his Jewish mother. Bahram, during his youth, was sent to the Lakhmid court in al-Hira, where he was raised under the tutelage of the Lakhmid king al-Nu&#x27;man I ibn Imru&#x27; al-Qays (r. 390–418). According to the modern historian O. Klíma, Bahram was probably sent there due to a disagreement with his father, while Giusto Traina suggests he was possibly sent there to avoid court intrigues.

At al-Hira, al-Nu&#x27;man provided Bahram with teachers from the Sasanian court, where the latter was taught law, archery, and equestrian arts. Since the death of the powerful Sasanian shah Shapur II (r. 309–379), the aristocrats and priests had expanded their influence and authority at the cost of the Sasanian government, nominating, dethroning, and murdering shahs, which included Yazdegerd I, who was murdered in 420. They now sought to stop the sons of Yazdegerd I from ascending the throne—Shapur IV, who was the eldest son of Yazdegerd I and governor of Armenia, quickly rushed to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon, and ascended the throne. He was, however, shortly after, murdered by the nobles and priests, who elected a son of Bahram IV, Khosrow, as shah.

Bahram was informed about the news of Yazdegerd I&#x27;s death when he was in the Arabian Desert—he opposed the decision of the nobles, and asked al-Mundhir I ibn al-Nu&#x27;man (who had succeeded his father al-Nu&#x27;man I) for military assistance, who agreed to help him. Bahram and al-Mundhir, at the head of an army of numerous soldiers, marched towards Ctesiphon, where Bahram promised that he would not reign like his father Yazdegerd I did. According to a long-existing popular legend written in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;), Bahram suggested that the royal crown and attire should be placed between two lions, and the person who retrieved them by killing the wild animals should be recognized as the shah of Iran.

Khosrow chose to pull out, whilst Bahram withstood the trial and won the throne. Bahram distrusted the nobles, who had been unreliable to the earlier Sasanian shahs, and thus chose instead to seek support from the Zoroastrian priesthood. He was the first Sasanian shah to not be crowned by a noble, but by a chief priest (&quot;mowbed&quot;).
Bahram married an Indian princess and received the port of Debal in Sind as a dowry, together with the adjacent territories. The Indus delta and the coast of Sind were of great commercial and strategic value at that time as well. Bahram also systematically pursued a policy of tribal resettlement in these coastal regions. For instance, a large group of nomadic pastrolists known as Zutt (Jats) from Sind were settled in the marshes of southern Iraq by the emperor.

== Reign ==
===War with Rome===

At the urging of the Zoroastrian priests and the Surenid minister (&quot;wuzurg framadar&quot;) Mihr Narseh, Bahram V began his reign with a systematic persecution of the Christians. The persecuted Christians fled to Roman territory, and were welcomed by the bishop of Constantinople, Atticus, who informed the Emperor of the persecution. The Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II was at the time deeply influenced by his religious sister Pulcheria, and had become more and more interested in Christianity. The Roman-Sasanian relationship already had some friction. The Sasanians had hired some Roman gold-diggers, but now refused to send them back; furthermore, they had also seized the properties of Roman merchants. So, when Sasanian ambassadors reached the Roman court to ask for the fugitives, Theodosius chose to break the peace and declare war, rather than giving them back.

In the year 421, the Romans sent their general Ardaburius with an extensive contingent into Armenia. The Iranian general Narses engaged Ardaburius in battle, but was defeated and forced to retreat. Narses planned to attack Mesopotamia, a Roman province that had been left unguarded, and moved there, but Ardaburius foresaw his enemy&#x27;s plan and intercepted him there. Ardaburius shortly received reinforcements and put the fortress of Nisibis under siege, but withdrew in the face of an advancing army under Bahram, who in turn besieged Theodosiopolis (probably Theodosiopolis in Osroene).

The peace treaty that ended the war (422) was negotiated by the &quot;magister officiorum&quot; Helio. It returned everything to the situation before the war (&quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;). Both parts agreed to reject Arab defectors of the other part, as well as to guarantee liberty of religion in their territories. Furthermore, the Romans also agreed to pay the Iranians for the protection of the pass at the Sasanian city of Derbent in the Caucasus. Since the peace treaty of 387, Iran and Rome had agreed that both empires were obligated to cooperate in the defense of the Caucasus against nomadic attacks. While the Romans saw this payment as political subsidies, the Iranians saw it as tribute, which proved that Rome was the deputy of Iran.

=== War with the Kidarites ===
Since the reign of Shapur II, the Iranians had to deal with nomadic invaders in the east known in scholarship as &quot;Iranian Huns&quot; (i.e. the Hephthalites, Kidarites, Chionites and Alchon Huns). Starting with Yazdegerd I, a shift had begun in the political perspective of the Sasanian Empire, which (originally disposed towards the West) moved to the East. The shift may have been triggered by hostile tribes in eastern Iran. The war with the Iranian Huns may have reawakened the mythical rivalry between the mythological Iranian Kayanian rulers and their Turanian enemies, which is illustrated by Younger Avestan texts. 

While Bahram was occupied with the war with the Romans, his eastern neighbours—Kidarites—crossed the Oxus river and invaded the Sasanian realm, conquering the rich city of Marw and even reaching as far as westwards as Ray. Bahram was thus forced to pay tribute to the Kidarites, in order to stop their incursions into his empire. When he had made peace with the Romans in 422, he started preparing to deal with the Kidarites. Not only was Marw a rich city, but also an important trading spot on the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and continued through Iran to Europe. Bahram first went to the holy temple of Adur Gushnasp in Adurbadagan, where he prayed. He then proceeded to Armenia to recruit additional troops.

Leaving his minister Mihr Narseh as his regent, Bahram passed through the mountain chain on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, eventually reaching Merv. There his forces routed the Kidarites, killing their king in the process and capturing his wife. A general of Bahram pursued the Kidarites into Transoxiana and inflicted another defeat on them. The war was concluded in 427, with Bahram cementing his name as a great champion of Iran. The name of Bahram was long remembered amongst the people of the surrounding area; the Sogdian city of Bukhara would later mint coins with his image. Bahram erected a pillar at the Oxus, which marked that the river constituted his empire&#x27;s eastern frontier. 

In Iranian mythology, the Oxus is often considered the eastern extent of Iran. The heroic archer Arash shot an arrow to the fringe of Khorasan, landing at the Oxus, which thus marked the limit of the Iranian border. Another figure, Esfandiyar, thudded his spear onto the ground at Balkh, warning the Hun king that progressing further would mean an invasion of Iran. Bahram thus believed that he had restored the ancient borders of his realm. He appointed his brother Narseh as the governor of the surrounding region. Bahram also founded (or refounded) the city of Marw-i Rot, near the city of Marw. In order to demonstrate his appreciation to the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda, Bahram bestowed most of his booty to Adur Gushnasp.

=== Incorporation of Armenia ===
Bahram V appointed Artaxias IV as king of Armenia in 422 at the request of the &quot;nakharars&quot;, reportedly on the term that the Armenian prince called himself the Middle Persian name Ardashir. However, the newly appointed king lacked the character he needed to rule and attain respect amongst his countrymen. As a result he fell out with the &quot;nakharar&quot;, who wanted Bahram V to remove Artaxias IV and put it under the direct control of Iran. However, the annexation of Armenia was strongly opposed by the Armenian &quot;katholikos&quot; Sahak, who felt that the rule of a Christian was better than that of a non-Christian regardless of his character or ability. He hoped that the Roman emperor Theodosius II would help the Armenians after he had sorted out his own issues in his empire. 

Regardless, the &quot;nakharar&quot; did not heed to his words, and contacted Bahram V, chastising both Artaxias V and Sahak for supporting the &quot;Greeks&quot;, i.e the Romans. Sahak went to Ctesiphon to request for support; there the bureaucrats urged Sahak to withdraw his support for Artaxias IV, which he refused. Artaxias IV was ultimately deposed and imprisoned, while Armenia was transformed into a Sasanian frontier province, governed by a &quot;marzban&quot; (&quot;margrave&quot;). Sahak was also removed from his office, and a Nestorian Syrian named Bar Kiso was appointed in his stead. The Sasanians were cautious in their efforts to respect the &quot;nakharars&quot;, and only asserted their presence at the Armenian capital of Dvin, which was also the seat of the &quot;marzban&quot;. Not all of the former territory of the Armenian kingdom was made into a province; the Armenian districts of Parskahayk and Paytakaran were incorporated into the province to its south, Adurbadagan.

== Domestic government ==
At the end of Yazdegerd I&#x27;s reign, the powerful Parthian House of Suren became powerful associates of the shah and played a key role in the affairs of the empire. This would continue under Bahram, where Suren power reached its zenith. Mihr Narseh served as the &quot;wuzurg framadar&quot; (&quot;minister&quot;) of the shah, while his three sons also occupied high offices; Zurvandad served as the chief &quot;herbad&quot; of the empire; Mahgushnasp was the &quot;wastaryoshan salar&quot; (&quot;chief agriculturalist&quot;), which meant that he oversaw the affairs of the land tax; Kardar was the &quot;arteshtaran-salar&quot; (&quot;chief of the warriors&quot;), a rank, which according to the medieval historian al-Tabari (d. 923), was higher than that of &quot;spahbed&quot; (&quot;army chief&quot;). The power and influence of the Suren family thus spread over the administrative, financial, and military affairs of the Sasanian Empire. They would continue to enjoy such as high status under Bahram&#x27;s son and successor Yazdegerd II () as well.

The influence of Bahram’s upbringing in the Arab urban center of al-Hira can be illustrated as follows: &quot;It was to al-Hira that the Persian monarch was sent as a prince, to be educated. Here, he was taught music, among other Arab accomplishments. When he ascended to the throne, one of his first edicts was to improve the status of musicians at the Persian court.&quot;

== Coins ==

Bahram V issued coins in gold, silver, copper and lead. They are (as usual in Sasanian numismatics) identifiable by his special headdress, in this case a mural crown topped with a korymbos resting on a crescent, and a round hairball in the king&#x27;s neck. The reverse shows the usual fire-altar, watched by two attendants at its sides. A special variant for Bahram V shows the head of the king in the flame upon the altar. 

The title of Bahram V on his coins was the typical &quot;Mazdēsn bay Warahrān šāhān šāh Ērān ud Anērān kēčihr az yazdān&quot; (&quot;the Mazda-worshiping, divine Bahram, King of Kings of Iran(ians) and non-Iran(ians), whose image/brilliance is from the gods&quot;). On some of rare coins minted in Pars, he is also seen with the title of &quot;kirbakkar&quot; (&quot;beneficent&quot;).

== Death and succession ==
Bahram died in 438; his manner of death is shrouded in mystery. According to the Persian poet Ferdowsi (d. 1020), Bahram died in his sleep; according to the poems &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; and &quot;Hasht-Behest&quot;, he disappeared in a cave whilst chasing an onager. According to other versions by early historians, Bahram either sunk in a swamp, fell into a deep hole, or drowned. The modern historian Richard Payne calls his death &quot;no less ambiguous than that of his father.&quot; Bahram V is remembered as one of the most famous kings in Iranian history, due to his cancellation of taxes and public debt at celebratory events, his encouragement of musicians, and his enjoyment of hunting. He was succeeded by his son Yazdegerd II.

According to the genealogy of the aristocratic Mikalids, the family was descended from Bahram. The Buyid King of Kings Adud al-Dawla () and the Shirvanshahs (861–1538) likewise claimed ancestry from Bahram. The Bahmanis of Deccan India also claimed descent from Bahram.

== In Persian literature ==

Bahram is in Islamic-era literature often known by the epithet of &quot;Gur/Gōr&quot; (&quot;Jur&quot; in Arabic sources), meaning &quot;onager/wild ass&quot;, seemingly due to his fondness of hunting the animal. The onager was the fastest animal in the deserts of Central Asia, even causing difficulties for a experienced rider to catch it. The legend of Bahram &quot;the Wild ass&quot; is based on lost Middle Persian records, such as the &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; (&quot;Book of Lords&quot;). The story of Bahram portrays that of a classic hunter king in Iranian literature, which is associated with the namesake god, known in Avestan as Verethragna. This type of ancient folklore goes back to at least the epic story of ancient Mesopotamian hero Gilgamesh. Later court poets often compared their overlord with ancient figures, such as Rostam or Bahram. In the &quot;Tarikh-i Akbari&quot;, Arif Qandahari compares the hunting skills of the Mughal emperor Akbar () with that of Bahram. He states that &quot;Akbar emptied the land of wild asses and deer, which brought amazement and joy to the soul of Bahram Gur.&quot;

=== &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; ===
&quot;Haft Peykar&quot; () also known as &quot;Bahramnameh&quot; (, &quot;The Book of Bahram&quot;) is a famous romantic epic written in 1197 by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi. A pre-Islamic story of Persian origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, &#x27;Ala&#x27; Al-Din korp Arslan. It is a romanticized biography of Bahram, who is born to Yazdegerd I after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to Ahura Mazda for a child. His adventurous life is already mentioned in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;) of Ferdowsi, which Nizami regularly implies. Nizami primarily overlooks the adventures of Bahram in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, or only mentions them briefly, while focusing on composing new information. He introduces the story by giving a description of the birth of Bahram and his upbringing in the court of the Lakhmid king al-Nu&#x27;man and his fabled palace Khawarnaq. Bahram, whose upbringing is entrusted to al-Nu&#x27;man, becomes a formidable huntsman.

While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name &quot;Haft Paykar&quot; (seven beauties). Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (the traditional Zoroastrian division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them. His father Yazdegerd I passes away and Bahram returns to Iran to claim his throne from pretenders. After some episodes he is recognized as shah and rescues the Iranians from a famine. Once the country is stable, the shah searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides. His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides. The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (the classical planetary system of the Zoroastrian world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet. Bahram is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect. Each of the princesses reside in luxurious pavilions. On each visit, the shah visits the princesses on successive days of the week. 

Each princess relates to the shah a story matching the mood of her respective color. These seven stories comprise roughly half of the whole poem. While the shah is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister takes over his kingdom. Bahram finds out that his realm is in turmoil, the royal treasury has been depleted and the neighboring kingdoms are posed to invade. He clears his mind first by going hunting. After returning from the hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree. The owner of the dog, who was a shepherd, tells the story of how his loyal guard dog had gained sexual favours by a she-wolf in exchange for betraying his flock. He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered. The minister is subsequently put to death and Bahram restores order and orders the seven domes to be converted to Zoroastrian fire temples. Bahram then goes hunting, but in an obscure manner disappears. As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (&quot;gūr&quot;) he instead finds his tomb (&quot;gūr&quot;).

=== Bahram and Azadeh ===

Azadeh (meaning free) was a Roman-slave girl in al-Hira, known for her singing and harpist skills (she played the chang). The young Bahram, during his time at the city, became her owner, and would take her with him whenever he went hunting. During one incident, Bahram bragged to Azadeh about his hunting skills and asked her to choose which gazelle he should shoot. Azadeh replied to him that true skill would be to transform a female gazelle into a male and a male into a female. 

Bahram accomplished this by shooting two arrows into the head of a female gazelle, thus giving her &quot;antlers&quot;. He then shoot at a male, cutting off his antlers. Azadeh, horrified by this, cried out: &quot;This art of yours is from the &quot;daevas&quot; [evil deities]&quot;. Bahram, enraged, threw her to the ground, and trampled her with his camel. The medieval historian al-Tha&#x27;labi (d. 1035/6) reports that al-Mundhir had the incident painted in the Khawarnaq palace at al-Hira. Nizami Ganjavi included the story in his &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; and had it slightly altered; Bahram orders one of his men to kill Fitna (her new name), but she persuades the officer to spare her and lie to Bahram of her death.

The story is likewise mentioned in an altered version in the &quot;Hasht-Behest&quot;, where Azadeh&#x27;s name has been changed to Dilaram (heart&#x27;s ease). In this version Bahram abandons her after she makes him enraged. After days of walking, she finds a skilled musician, who teaches her his craft. One day, word of a skilled female musician reaches Bahram, which leads him to search for her. Bahram eventually finds Dilaram, and asks for her forgiveness. She accepts, and they return to the Khawarnaq palace.

<text>The University of Ottawa (), often referred to as uOttawa or U of O, is a bilingual public research university in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The main campus is located on directly to the northeast of Downtown Ottawa across the Rideau Canal in the Sandy Hill neighbourhood.

The University of Ottawa was first established as the College of Bytown in 1848 by the first bishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa, Joseph-Bruno Guigues. Placed under the direction of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, it was renamed the College of Ottawa in 1861 and received university status five years later through a royal charter. On 5 February 1889, the university was granted a pontifical charter by Pope Leo XIII, elevating the institution to a pontifical university. The university was reorganized on July 1, 1965, as a corporation, independent from any outside body or religious organization. As a result, the civil and pontifical charters were kept by the newly created Saint Paul University, federated with the university. The remaining civil faculties were retained by the reorganized university.

The University of Ottawa is the largest English-French bilingual university in the world. The university offers a wide variety of academic programs, administered by ten faculties: Arts, Education, Engineering, Health Sciences, Law, Medicine, Science, Social Sciences, and the Telfer School of Management. The University of Ottawa Library includes 12 branches, holding a collection of over 4.5 million titles. The university is a member of the Canadian U15 group of research-intensive universities, with a research income of in 2022.

The school is co-educational and enrols almost 40,000 undergraduate and over 6,000 post-graduate students. The school has enrolled 2,300 students into the French Immersion Studies program in fall 2022. The school has approximately 10,600 international students from 150 countries, accounting for 26 per cent of the student population. The university has a network of more than 195,000 alumni. The university&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Gee-Gees and are members of U Sports.

==History==
The university was established on September 26, 1848 as the College of Bytown by the first Roman Catholic bishop of Ottawa, Joseph-Bruno Guigues. He entrusted administration to the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The college was originally located in Lower Town, housed in a wooden building next to the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. However, space quickly became an issue for administrators, triggering two moves in 1852 and a final move to Sandy Hill in 1856. The Sandy Hill property was donated by Louis-Théodore Besserer, where he offered a substantial parcel from his estate for the college. The college was renamed College of Ottawa in 1861, following the city&#x27;s name change from Bytown to Ottawa. In 1866, the college received its first charter, as well as university status, making it the final institution in Canada to receive a royal charter from London before the British North America Act, 1867 made education a provincial responsibility. By 1872 the university had already begun to confer undergraduate degrees, with master&#x27;s degrees coming in 1875 and doctoral degrees in 1888. On February 5, 1889, the university was granted a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII, elevating the university to a pontifical university.

The university faced a crisis when fire destroyed the main building on 2 December 1903. After the fire, the university hired New York architect A. O. Von Herbulis to design its replacement, Tabaret Hall. It was among the first Canadian structures to be completely fireproof, built of reinforced concrete. Women first enrolled in 1919.

In the fall of 1939, a Canadian Officer Training Corp was established at the university, with training beginning in January 1940. The Canadian Officers&#x27; Training Corps, University of Ottawa Contingent, which comprised a company, headquarters and three platoons in 1939, was authorized to become a battalion in 1940. By 1941, the unit swelled to 550 men. An air force Officers&#x27; Training Corp was created in 1942 and a naval Officers&#x27; training corp in 1943. Participation in one of the three corps became mandatory for all students over 18, although they were not obliged to participate in the actual war at the end of their studies. During this time, the Royal Canadian Air Force used parts of the university&#x27;s grounds for training and the university constructed barracks to house members of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps. In total 1,158 students and alumni of the university enrolled the Canadian Forces during the Second World War, of which 50 died overseas. The unit was eventually disbanded during the unification of the Armed Forces in 1968.

The Ottawa architecture firm of Burgess, McLean &amp; MacPhadyen designed the Eastern Ontario Institute of Technology (later to merge with the Ontario Vocational Centre and renamed Algonquin College), opened its new Rideau Campus on a 12-acre city owned Lees Avenue site in 1964. After being unused for a number of years, the midcentury academic complex was sold to the University of Ottawa in January 2007.

The university was reorganized on 1 July 1965 as a corporation independent from any outside body or religious organization, becoming publicly funded. As a result, the civil and pontifical charters were transferred to the newly created Saint Paul University, federated with the corporation, while the remaining civil faculties were retained by the reorganized university.

In 1970, 100 Laurier East became property of the University of Ottawa, acquired at a cost of $1,120,900. Previously named Juniorat du Sacré-Coeur, the property became the university&#x27;s oldest building after it was acquired. At a cost of $28,000, it was built by Joseph Bourque, a Hull contractor and church builder, and completed in 1894. The Juniorat du Sacré-Coeur provided classical education for young men who wished to pursue a religious life and join the Order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The building was expanded in 1937, an expansion that was indistinguishable from the original structure. The huge cross that used to dominate the top of the building was removed after its purchase, leaving only small references to the building&#x27;s religious history as the Juniorat du Sacré-Coeur. The property now houses the university&#x27;s department of Visual Arts. It is located at the corner of Laurier Avenue and Cumberland Street, near the Rideau Canal.

In 1974, a new policy mandated by the Government of Ontario strengthened institutional bilingualism at the university, with specific instructions to further bilingualism and biculturalism and preserve and develop French culture.

In 1989, Dr. Wilbert Keon of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute performed the country&#x27;s first neonatal artificial heart transplant on an 11-day-old baby.

On 11 November 1998, during the University of Ottawa&#x27;s 150th-anniversary celebrations, two war memorial plaques were unveiled in the foyer of Tabaret Hall which honour 1000 graduates of the university community who took part in armed conflict, especially the list of 50 graduates who lost their lives.

The engineering building, Colonel By Hall, was unveiled in September 2005 as a memorial dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel John By, Royal Engineers.

In 2020, the University of Ottawa attracted significant global media attention due to a controversy over academic freedom.

==Campus==
The university&#x27;s main campus is situated within the neighbourhood of Sandy Hill (&quot;Côte-de-Sable&quot;). The main campus is bordered to the north by the ByWard Market district, to the east by Sandy Hill&#x27;s residential area, and to the southwest by Nicholas Street, which runs adjacent to the Rideau Canal on the western half of the university. As of the 2010–2011 academic year, the main campus occupied , though the university owns and manages other properties throughout the city, raising the university&#x27;s total extent to . The main campus moved two times before settling in its final location in 1856. When the institution was first founded, the campus was located next to the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. With space a major issue in 1852, the campus moved to a location that is now across from the National Gallery of Canada. In 1856, the institution moved to its present location.

The buildings at the university vary in age from 100 Laurier (1893) to 150 Louis-Pasteur Private (2018). In 2011 the average age of buildings was 63. In the 2011–2012 academic year, the university owned and managed 30 main buildings, 806 research laboratories, 301 teaching laboratories and 257 classrooms and seminar rooms. The main campus is divided between its older Sandy Hill campus and its Lees campus, purchased in 2007. While Lees Campus is not adjacent to Sandy Hill, it is displayed as part of the main campus on school maps. Lees campus, within walking distance of Sandy Hill, was originally a satellite campus owned by Algonquin College.

An O-Train station, uOttawa station, is situated on the western periphery of the campus adjacent to Nicholas Street and the Rideau Canal.

===Library===

The University of Ottawa Library is a network of twelve locations, and maintains a collection of approximately two million printed books, one million e-books, 423,986 maps, 87,216 music items and more with its collection budget of . The Library has digitized over 20,000 French books and some of the aerial photographs from the National Air Photo Library collection which are in the public domain. In addition, with consent from the National Aboriginal Health Organization&#x27;s (NAHO) Board of Directors, the Library and the Indigenous Program at the Faculty of Medicine archived the NAHO&#x27;s website using Archive It which is no longer publicly available.

The main library is in Morisset Hall, which also houses the Media Centre, Archives and Special Collections, and the Geographic, Statistical and Government Information Centre. The university has five other specialized libraries: the Brian Dickson Law Library, located in Fauteux Hall; the Health Sciences Library, located at the Roger-Guindon campus; the Management Library, located in the Desmarais Building; the Isobel Firestone Music Library, located in Pérez Hall; and the Annex, an off-site storage facility that houses less-used portions of the collection.

The Morisset Library was named for Auguste-Marie Morisset who was a chief librarian from 1934 to 1958 and the Brian Dickson Law Library was named for Brian Dickson who was the chief justice of Canada. The Archives and Special Collections in Morisett Library contains holdings on a variety of subjects, particularly on feminism movement in Canada and it has the largest collection of feminist publications in Canada from periodicals and newsletters including Branching Out and Broadside. In addition, in 2018, the Archives and Special Collections collaborated with the Library and Archives Canada and the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists – Education and Research Institute (INWES-ERI) founded by Monique Frize for the project of Canadian Archive of Women in STEM to develop a search index portal to facilitate discovery in one central location.

In addition to housing the university&#x27;s collections, the library also maintains the Learning Crossroads, which features two lecture halls and more than 1,000 individual and group study rooms. It houses a wide range of cutting-edge technologies like a video wall, featuring a large 8K screen, virtual reality equipment and multimedia studios. The University of Ottawa Library is a member of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries, the Association of Research Libraries, and the Ontario Council of University Libraries.

====History====
The library dates back to the foundation of the institution in 1848. In 1903, the main building of the university where the library was located was destroyed by fire; therefore, all the intellectual treasures were lost. After this fire, it was top priority for the university authorities to rebuild the library and it had received donations from Canadian Federal and Provincial Governments and Foreign governments, particularly from France, United States, Great Britain, and other countries. On October 15, 1932, the Carnegie Corporation of New York informed that a grant of would be donated to the library over a period of three years which was used for the foundation of the library. In addition, in 1938, the French Government donated a gift which allowed the library to purchase books to the value of and the foundation of the Society of Friends of the Library of the University of Ottawa was founded to help the library restore.

===Museum===
The University of Ottawa Museum of Classical Antiquities was established in 1975 as a teaching collection, operated by the Department of Classical and Religious Studies. Composed of artifacts which reflect daily life during the period from the 7th century BC to the 7th century AD, the permanent collection is enhanced by touring exhibitions. The university also houses a student-run gallery space, known as Gallery 115 on the main floor of 100 Laurier East. The student-run gallery provides students the opportunity to work within a gallery setting. It provides graduate and undergraduate students a chance to develop curatorial and administrative skills, as well as, display their own art pieces. In co-operation with the University of Ottawa, the Gallery operates under a democratic structure representing many students enrolled in various programs, including Visual Arts, Art History and Art Administration.

===Housing and student facilities===

Although most students live off-campus, the university has eleven student residences: Leblanc Hall, Marchand Hall, Stanton, Thompson Hall, Hyman Soloway, Friel, Henderson, Rideau, 45 Mann, 90 University and Annex. The university offers a variety of housing options. Four of the seven residences are conventional single and double bedrooms. Brooks and Hyman Soloway are 2–4 bedroom apartment-styled residences, while 90 University is a two bedroom suite-styled residence. On January 24, 2018, the new Annex residence was officially announced to students in an email newsletter from the school&#x27;s &#x27;The Gee&#x27; news outlet. The new residence opened in September 2018; it has 1-5 bedroom units including studio-styled single rooms. In September 2010, 26.2 percent of first-year students lived on campus, part of the 8.8 percent of the overall undergraduate population which lived on campus. Data from 2019 indicate nearly 3,000 students living on campus.

Residents are represented by the Residents&#x27; Association of the University of Ottawa (RAUO). With a mandate to help improve the quality of life in residences, each building elects a representative to the association. The RAUO also provides a political representation on the behalf of the residents. Buildings may collect a small fee, known as the floor fund to pay for the group.

The Jock Turcot University Centre (UCU) is the centre of student life and programming. Located between Montpetit Hall and Morisett Library, the centre was completed in 1973 at a cost of over . In spring of 2017, an expanded rooftop patio was added to the university&#x27;s &#x27;UCU&#x27;, allowing students to have a more open campus in a downtown setting. Funding for the centre was partially offset by the Jock Turcot University Fund, which was set up by the student body. The centre was named after former student federation president Jock Turcot, who was killed in a traffic collision in 1965. The university has over thirty-five dining outlets. This includes several major restaurant chains.

===Off-campus facilities===
Off-campus faculties are located throughout Ottawa. The university owns and operates another campus located in Ottawa&#x27;s Riverview neighbourhood, known as the Health Science or Alta Vista campus. Located on Smyth Road, the Health Science campus is . The campus primarily serves the Faculty of Medicine as well as hosting programs for the Faculty of Health Sciences. Roger Guindon Hall serves as the primary building for students at the campus. The Health Science campus is located in between The Ottawa Hospital and the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, both of which are university-affiliated. Many of the hospital&#x27;s health professionals and researchers teach in the Faculties of Medicine and Health Sciences. Medical and health sciences students learn on the job at The Ottawa Hospital.

The university operates the Centre for Executive Leadership at the World Exchange Plaza. Located on O&#x27;Connor Street in Downtown Ottawa, the centre is primarily used by the Telfer School of Management&#x27;s Executive Master of Business Administration program. The centre includes one amphitheatre-style classroom, seven case rooms for team meetings, collaborative work and/or independent study and conference and boardroom spaces.

The university also maintains a small campus in Kanata focused on encouraging student employment at the many technology companies based in the Kanata North Technology Park.

===Sustainability===

The Office of Campus Sustainability, established in 2006, coordinates, promotes and implements sustainable development activities. The Office of Campus Sustainability is headed by the Sustainable Development Committee. Membership of the committee comprises administrators, students, community groups and the City of Ottawa. Along with the other members of the Council of Ontario Universities, the University of Ottawa signed a pledge in November 2009 known as &quot;Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World&quot;, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility. The university is a signatory of the Talloires Declaration. 

Several programs from the university placed in the 2011 Corporate Knights rankings, which measures how well Canadian universities integrate sustainability into their curriculum. Telfer School of Management ranked fifth in Canada for undergraduate business programs. The Corporate Knights also ranked Telfer eighth in Canada for MBA program. The University of Ottawa has implemented a variety of activities in order to increase sustainability across campus. The university has been working on creating a more sustainable campus through the efforts of the Office of Campus Sustainability.

One of the main programs occurring at the University of Ottawa to promote waste reduction is RecycleMania. RecycleMania is a competition among colleges and universities that occurs within a 10-week period of time. Each school is to report their trash and recycling data which are then ranked according to the largest quantity of recyclables. The purpose of this competition is to see who has the highest recycling rate. As results fluctuate among competitors, schools get more enticed to keep reducing waste. In 2011, the University of Ottawa was awarded first place among Canadian universities in the RecycleMania competition. The university also ranked 14th out of 180 universities in the “waste minimization” category in the international RecycleMania competition. The RecycleMania program will continue to encourage and inform University of Ottawa students on how to change their consumption habits as well as recycle.

One of the newer programs initiated by the University of Ottawa is the Free Store. The Free Store is a location in which students can drop off items they no longer want and pick up items they do want for free. The reason this was created was to reduce consumption by offering free items to students who no longer want items that may be used by someone else. Items that are dropped off include clothing, textbooks, electronics, and office supplies. The Free Store is located at 647 King Edward. In 2007, the Office of Campus Sustainability coined the term “Gratuiterie” as the French translation to their Free Store. Since then, the concept of la Gratuiterie has gained widespread popularity in France, namely in Grenoble where the first Gratuiterie appeared. Since then France has seen a boom of “Gratuiteries” around the country.

On September 1, 2010, the University of Ottawa stopped selling bottled water on campus and created a bottled water ban in order to reduce plastic consumption, and encourage students to carry reusable water bottles and use campus water fountains.
 The University of Ottawa put forth $150,000 to improve the water fountains across campus.

The new Social Sciences Building at the University of Ottawa is the school&#x27;s latest green initiative. The fifteen-storey building that took about four years of planning and construction to complete opened its doors in September 2012. The Social Sciences Building that cost a grand total of $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work. This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities. This building is very different among the rest of the university&#x27;s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof. The green wall is the tallest living biofilter wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building&#x27;s air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn&#x27;t need to be artificially introduced.

The living wall was built on October 14, 2012, by Diamond &amp; Shmitt Architects. Eighty per cent of the building&#x27;s heating will be recycled and created through the building&#x27;s data centres (computer labs, etc.).
 This heating system will also heat nearby buildings including Vanier Hall. Not only has the University of Ottawa stayed true to their reputation of being on the forefront of sustainable living by creating the green wall, but they have also created a green roof, which is potentially the first green roof constructed on a Canadian university campus. The green roof was established in 1971 on the rooftop of the Colonel By building. One of the faculty&#x27;s goals is to achieve a LEED Gold Certification, which is given to green buildings that meet specific environmental guidelines.

In 2006, the University of Ottawa established the first community campus garden. Over the course of the past eight years, the community garden has expanded in terms of the number of plants that occupy it, and has grown into a full-fledged garden containing more than thirty pots in various locations on campus. The community garden is open from early spring until mid-autumn. In addition to the various eco-friendly accomplishments that have been added to the university over the years, in 2005, the university established a boreal forest and wetland environment, and is in the middle of creating a living classroom for students to enjoy. The University of Ottawa is on the rise to being one of the top eco-friendly Canadian universities in North America.

The University of Ottawa has also introduced a bike share program to encourage cycling to and from school. The university offers free bicycle rentals and access to free maintenance and repair workshops. Along with new bike routes and services, the university has enhanced car-pooling and shuttle services, and is served by uOttawa and Lees stations along the Confederation Line, encouraging students to use public transit via a discounted university student bus pass.

The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) provides various activities that attempt to increase sustainability practices among individuals and institutions, promote resource sharing, and make sustainable practices a norm within higher education institutions. The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS), created by AASHE, was designed to provide guidelines for better understanding of sustainability and build a more sustainable community throughout university campuses. It is a way for universities and colleges to measure their sustainability efforts. The program compares higher education facilities’ sustainability initiatives and ranks them based on their efforts. In 2011, the University of Ottawa received a silver star by the STARS program.

The Office of Campus Sustainability continues to create various events and programs to promote sustainability among students at the University of Ottawa. They are responsible for informing students of all initiatives and programs put forth by the university. Eco-friendly initiatives are growing rapidly at the University of Ottawa with the help of the office. One of them is &quot;Cleaning the capital&quot;.

==Administration==

Governance is conducted through the Board of Governors and the Senate, whose roles were established by the University of Ottawa Act, 1965. The Act describes their membership and powers, as well as their principal officers. The Board provides overall governance and management, including financial decisions and the implementation of policies and procedures. The Board consists of an executive committee which includes the Chair of the Board and the Vice-Chair and Chair of the Executive Committee. As stipulated by the act, the board comprises no more than 32 members, appointed or elected by the various parts of the university community. While not stipulated in the act, the board&#x27;s membership includes elected undergraduate and graduate student representatives. The Board includes one honorary member, the current chancellor.

The Senate sets educational policies and the management of academic issues. Such powers include the ability to create and abolish faculties, departments, schools and institutes, academic regulations, admission standards, degree and diploma requirements. It confers certificates, degrees at all levels and with the approval of the board, honorary doctorates. The Senate consists of 72 members including president, who acts as its chair. Other members of the Senate, as mentioned in the act, include the chancellor, the president, vice-presidents and the dean of each faculty, including those of federated universities. While not outlined in the act, the Senate includes students from each faculty.

As stipulated in the act, the chancellor is the university&#x27;s titular head and is accorded a place of honour at commencement exercises and other functions and may preside at examinations. The chancellor is appointed by the board with the concurrence of the Senate and holds the office for one or more four-year terms. The president is the chief executive officer and chairman of the Senate with the responsibility of managing the direction of academic work and general administration, teaching staff, officers, servants and students. The president is appointed by the board and continues until the board votes otherwise. The office was first referred to as superior until the university received a pontifical charter, when the name changed to rector in 1889. In 2004, the English title of rector was replaced with president.

===Finances===
In the 2021-2022 review of financial results, net assets stood at CA$1.793 billion, which is a decrease of $174.7M (8.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021. Revenue increased by $93.9M to reach $1,246.1M, compared to $1,152.2M in 2020–2021. The largest single source of revenue originates from tuition and other fees, along with grant revenue, accounted for 73.4% of total revenue. Expenses increased by $89.3M (7.7%) to $1,160.4M, compared to $1,102.4M in 2020–2021. The increase is due mainly to higher expenses for salaries and benefits, scholarships and financial aid, and additional costs stemming from COVID-19. As stated in the 2021-2022 financial results, its endowment was valued at CA$321.3 million, a $17.5M decrease in endowments compared to the year before due to the reduced market value of investments.

The university was registered as an educational charitable organization in Canada on 1 January 1967. As of 2015, the university was registered primarily as a post-secondary institution. The university&#x27;s Institutional Research and Planning department estimated that its students, staff, visitors and the institution itself brought in an estimated total of into the local economy in 2011.

=== Court Challenges Program ===
Since 2018, the University of Ottawa has been hosting the administration of the modernized Court Challenges Program (CCP) whose decisions are made by experts in human rights and language rights which are independent from both the university and the government. The Department of Canadian Heritage, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, chose the University of Ottawa as the independent organization responsible for implementing and managing the new CCP. The CCP is an administrative unit integrated within the Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute (OLBI) of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ottawa. In selecting a third-party institution to host the CCP, the Government is ensuring that the Program will operate independently to advance the rights and freedoms of all Canadians.

==Academics==
The University of Ottawa is a research university, and a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. It functions on a semester system, operating fall/winter and spring/summer sessions. Undergraduate programs comprise the majority of the school&#x27;s enrolment, with 39,770 full-time and part-time undergraduate students, compared to 8,128 graduate students in fall 2022. Excluding Saint Paul, the university conferred 7,449 bachelor&#x27;s and professional degrees, 208 doctoral degrees, 1,815 master&#x27;s degrees in 2015.

The university also offers students the opportunity to earn credits while studying abroad, through student exchange programs, and summer programs. The university has exchange agreements with over 250 institutions in over 52 countries.

===Bilingualism and biculturalism===
As of 2016, the university was the world&#x27;s largest English-French bilingual university. The university is one of the three bilingual universities in Ontario that is not federated with a larger university. Since its inception the university has seen itself as fostering English-French bilingualism. However, bilingualism was only made an official university policy in 1965 when the Government of Ontario passed &quot;An Act respecting Université d&#x27;Ottawa&quot; through the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Section 4 of that Act specifically states that an object and purpose of the university is &quot;to further bilingualism and biculturalism and to preserve and develop French culture in Ontario&quot;, and &quot;to further ... Christian principles&quot;. Despite that law, these parts of the university&#x27;s mandate are now arguably superseded by the 1982 &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which constitutionalizes multiculturalism (not biculturalism) and freedom of religion.

The university operates the Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute (OLBI). The OLBI was officially opened on 1 July 2007, replacing its predecessor, the Second Language Institute. Both institutes promoted English-French bilingualism, although the OLBI holds an expanded mandate, to strengthen research, innovation and outreach efforts in official languages and bilingualism. The university is a member of the Association of Universities of the Canadian Francophonie, an association which promotes post-secondary education and research in French.

While the university maintains bilingualism as an official policy, students need not be bilingual. Instead, most courses and programs are offered in both languages. As of April 2023, the percentage of students who used French as their primary language of education was at 30 percent (14,218 students), while the number of students which use English as their primary language for education was 70 percent (33,680 students). As of March 2009, 68.6 percent of professors in bilingual positions were considered to be actively bilingual, while bilingual staff comprised 91.5 percent.

===Co-operative education===

The University of Ottawa&#x27;s cooperative education program is an optional program which presents students with the ability to take part in paid work placements as part of their academic program. The program is offered for both undergraduate programs and certain graduate programs. The program was first introduced to the school in 1980. The University of Ottawa&#x27;s co-operative program has expanded since its creation and now stands as the second largest program in Ontario with a placement success rate of over 98 per cent. The co-operative education program is designed to have students alternate between work and study terms, being placed in fields relevant to their area of study. The university&#x27;s co-op program is available for a wide range of programs for undergraduate students and can be offered in French or English, depending on the program.

In terms of national rankings, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ranked the university sixth in their 2023 Medical Doctoral university rankings. Ottawa was ranked in spite of having opted out — along with several other universities in Canada — of participating in Maclean&#x27;s graduate survey since 2006.

The university has also placed in a number of rankings that evaluated the employment prospects of its graduates. The university has an average graduate employment rate of 97 per cent, providing a significant educational, research, and economic benefit to the National Capital Region.

===Research===

The university is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada. Research at the University of Ottawa is managed through the Office of the Vice-President, Research. The university operates 40 research centres and institutes including the André E. Lalonde Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, the Centre for Research in Photonics at the University of Ottawa, the Centre for Research on Educational and Community Services, the Institute for Science, Society and Policy, the Ottawa Health Research Institute and the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. In 2018, Research Infosource ranked Ottawa 9th on their list for top 50 research universities in Canada, with a sponsored research income (external sources of funding) of $324.581 million in 2017. In the same year, the university&#x27;s faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $246,800, while its graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $47,000. The largest source of research funding comes from the federal government, which provided $142.8 million in 2010. This was followed by the provincial government, which provided $31.2 million and the corporate/private sector which provides $25.8 million in research funding.

The university&#x27;s research performance has been noted several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Ottawa 147th in the world, and eighth in Canada.

===Admission===
Admission requirements differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada and international students, due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. The admissions office maintains that an admission rate of at least 73 percent is required, although the rate may increase based on the popularity of a program. In 2018, the secondary school average for admitted applicants to the university was 85.1 per cent. The 2015 acceptance (registrant) rate of first choice student is 45.6 percent. The 2010 secondary school rate for full-time first-year students, including Saint Paul was 82.1 percent. The retention rate for first-time, full-time first year students in 2009 was 86.1 percent.

Students may apply for financial aid such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. Aid may come in the form of loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief and work programs. In 2011–2012, the university provided $71.458 million in financial aid and scholarships.

==Student life==
The two main student unions on administrative and policy issues are the University of Ottawa Students&#x27; Union (UOSU) for all undergraduate students and the Graduate Students&#x27; Association (GSAÉD) for graduate students. Additionally, graduate (and undergraduate) students who are employed as research assistants, teaching assistants, markers, proctors, residence life workers, and lifeguards are members of CUPE2626, a local chapter of the Canadian Union of Public Employees. The union and the university are bound by a collective agreement.

Until December 2018, the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa acted as the undergraduate student union, until it lost its official status, after their agreement was terminated with the university. The university cited the SFUO&#x27;s handling of allegations of financial mismanagement, fraud, and workplace misconduct as the reason. In 2019, students voted to choose a new undergraduate student association in a referendum. On February 11, 2019 the University of Ottawa announced the results of the student referendum. The University of Ottawa announced the University of Ottawa Students’ Union (UOSU) had been selected as the new student union to represent undergraduate students. The university will make its best efforts to have a new agreement in place by May 1, 2019.

In addition, most faculties have student representative bodies. Resident students are represented by the Residents&#x27; Association of the University of Ottawa. More than 175 student organizations and clubs are officially accredited by the student union, covering interests such as academics, culture, religion, social issues and recreation. Many of them centre on the student activity centre. Two non-profit, independent student newspapers publish at the university. &quot;The Fulcrum&quot; publishes in English and is a member of the Canadian University Press, while &quot;La Rotonde&quot; publishes in French. Campus radio station CHUO-FM (89.1 FM), Canada&#x27;s second-oldest, began broadcasting in 1984. The UOSU recognizes three fraternities; Sigma Chi, Sigma Alpha Mu and Omega Theta Alpha; and ten sororities, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Phi, Nu Sigma Pi, Sigma Beta Phi, Xi Delta Theta, Zeta Theta Xi, and Kappa Beta Gamma.

===Athletics===

Athletics and student recreation at the university are managed by Sports Services. Varsity teams compete in either Ontario University Athletics or Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec conference of U Sports, varying by team. The university hosts 29 competitive clubs, including 10 varsity. The first athletic group at the university was formed in 1885, with garnet and grey becoming the official team colours. Shortly thereafter, garnet and grey became the official colours of the university. Varsity teams&#x27; names are a play on the initials of the colours. Varsity teams did not immediately adopt a name, leading others to refer to them by their colours–&quot;Garnet and Grey&quot; in English, &quot;Grenat et Gris&quot; in French. Ottawa sports media referred to the teams as &quot;GG&quot; for the teams, a nickname that could easily be used in both English and French. Eventually the shorthand became official. Because the term gee gee also describes the lead horse in a race, the horse became UOttawa&#x27;s mascot. The university&#x27;s varsity teams share a rivalry with the Carleton Ravens, who both compete in the Capital Hoops Classic basketball game, and the Colonel By Classic ice hockey game, and the Canadian football Panda Game.

The university owns and operates three athletic facilities on the university&#x27;s two campuses. Montpetit Hall and Minto Sports Complex are located on the main campus and another is located on Lees.

Montpetit is centrally located on campus and is the home to the varsity basketball and swimming teams. The Minto Sports Complex houses the university&#x27;s two arena ice rinks, which seat 840 as well as Matt Anthony Field the home of Gee-Gees soccer and rugby, which seats 1,500. In 2013, the university opened Gee-Gees Field a new stadium for its varsity football team located at Lees Campus. The new stadium holds over 4,000 spectators and serves as the first on-campus home to the Gee-Gees football team in 120 years. Along with the stadium came all new facilities including: new team rooms, coaches’ offices, dedicated athletic therapy and video rooms.

All facilities are shared with both recreational users, as well as varsity teams.

The university does not provide full-ride athletic scholarships. On the recreational level, the university&#x27;s sports services operate intramural sport leagues and tournaments with a participation rate of one in eight students. Sports include badminton, volleyball, basketball, swimming, soccer and martial arts.

==Notable people==

<doc id="140700" wikidata="Q191455" url="?curid=140700" title="Shapur I">
<text>Shapur I (also spelled Shabuhr I; ) was the second Sasanian King of Kings of Iran. The precise dating of his reign is disputed, but it is generally agreed that he ruled from 240 to 270, with his father Ardashir I as co-regent until the death of the latter in 242. During his co-regency, he helped his father with the conquest and destruction of the city of Hatra, whose fall was facilitated, according to Islamic tradition, by the actions of his future wife al-Nadirah. Shapur also consolidated and expanded the empire of Ardashir I, waged war against the Roman Empire, and seized its cities of Nisibis and Carrhae while he was advancing as far as Roman Syria. Although he was defeated at the Battle of Resaena in 243 by Roman emperor Gordian III (), he was the following year able to win the Battle of Misiche and force the new Roman emperor Philip the Arab () to sign a favorable peace treaty that was regarded by the Romans as &quot;a most shameful treaty&quot;.

Shapur later took advantage of the political turmoil within the Roman Empire by undertaking a second expedition against it in 252/3–256, sacking the cities of Antioch and Dura-Europos. In 260, during his third campaign, he defeated and captured the Roman emperor, Valerian. He did not seem interested in permanently occupying the Roman provinces, choosing instead to resort to plundering and pillaging, gaining vast amounts of riches. The captives of Antioch, for example, were allocated to the newly reconstructed city of Gundeshapur, later famous as a center of scholarship. In the 260s, subordinates of Shapur suffered setbacks against Odaenathus, the king of Palmyra. According to Shapur&#x27;s inscription at Hajiabad, he still remained active at the court in his later years, participating in archery. He died of illness in Bishapur, most likely in May 270.

Shapur was the first Iranian monarch to use the title of &quot;King of Kings of Iranians and non-Iranians&quot;; beforehand the royal titulary had been &quot;King of Kings of Iranians&quot;. He had adopted the title due to the influx of Roman citizens whom he had deported during his campaigns. However, it was first under his son and successor Hormizd I, that the title became regularised. Shapur had new Zoroastrian fire temples constructed, incorporated new elements into the faith from Greek and Indian sources, and conducted an extensive program of rebuilding and refounding of cities.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Shapur&quot; was a popular name in Sasanian Iran, being used by three Sasanian monarchs and other notables of the Sasanian era and its later periods. Derived from Old Iranian &quot;*xšayaθiya.puθra&quot; (&quot;son of a king&quot;), it must initially have been a title, which became—at least in the late 2nd century CE—a personal name. It appears in the list of Arsacid kings in some Arabic-Persian sources; however, this is anachronistic. Shapur is transliterated in other languages as; Greek &quot;Sapur&quot;, &quot;Sabour&quot; and &quot;Sapuris&quot;; Latin &quot;Sapores&quot; and &quot;Sapor&quot;; Arabic &quot;Sābur&quot; and &quot;Šābur&quot;; New Persian &quot;Šāpur&quot;, &quot;Šāhpur&quot;, &quot;Šahfur&quot;.

== Background ==
According to the semi-legendary &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot;, a Middle Persian biography of Ardashir I, the daughter of the Parthian king Artabanus IV, Zijanak, attempted to poison her husband Ardashir. Discovering her intentions, Ardashir ordered her to be executed. Finding out about her pregnancy, the &quot;mobads&quot; (priests) were against it. Nevertheless, Ardashir still demanded her execution, which led the &quot;mobads&quot; to conceal her and her son Shapur for seven years, until the latter was identified by Ardashir, who chooses to adopt him based on his virtuous traits. This type of narrative is repeated in Iranian historiography. According to 5th-century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, the Median king Astyages wanted to have his grandson Cyrus killed because he believed that he would one day overthrow him. A similar narrative is also found in the story of the mythological Iranian king Kay Khosrow. According to the modern historian Bonner, the story of Shapur&#x27;s birth and uprising &quot;may conceal a marriage between Ardashir and an Arsacid princess or perhaps merely a noble lady connected with the Parthian aristocracy.&quot; On his inscriptions, Shapur identifies his mother as a certain Murrod.

== Background and state of Iran==
Shapur I was a son of Ardashir I and his wife Murrod or Denag. The background of the family is obscure; although based in Pars (also known as Persis), they were not native to the area, and were seemingly originally from the east. The historian Marek Jan Olbrycht has suggested that the family was descended from the Indo-Parthians of Sakastan. Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani also noted similarities between the early Sasanians and the Indo-Parthians, such as their coinage. Yet, he stated that &quot;evidence might still be too inconclusive.&quot;

Pars, a region in the southwestern Iranian plateau, was the homeland of the southwestern branch of the Iranian peoples, the Persians. It was also the birthplace of the first Iranian Empire, the Achaemenids. The region served as the centre of the empire until its conquest by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (). Since the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, Pars was ruled by local dynasts subject to the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. These dynasts held the ancient Persian title of &quot;frataraka&quot; (&quot;leader, governor, forerunner&quot;), which is also attested in the Achaemenid-era. Later under the &quot;frataraka&quot; Wadfradad II (fl. 138 BCE) was made a vassal of the Iranian Parthian (Arsacid) Empire. The &quot;frataraka&quot; were shortly afterwards replaced by the Kings of Persis, most likely at the accession of the Arsacid monarch Phraates II (). Unlike the &quot;fratarakas&quot;, the Kings of Persis used the title of shah (&quot;king&quot;), and laid foundations to a new dynasty, which may be labelled the Darayanids.

Under Vologases V (), the Parthian Empire was in decline, due to wars with the Romans, civil wars and regional revolts. The Roman emperor Septimius Severus () had invaded the Parthian domains in 196, and two years later did the same, this time sacking the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon. At the same time, revolts occurred in Media and Persis. The Iranologist Touraj Daryaee argues that the reign of Vologases V was &quot;the turning point in Parthian history, in that the dynasty lost much of its prestige.&quot; The kings of Persis were now unable to depend on their weakened Parthian overlords. Indeed, in 205/6, Pabag rebelled and overthrew the Bazrangid ruler of Persis, Gochihr, taking Istakhr for himself. Around 208 Vologases VI succeeded his father Vologases V as king of the Arsacid Empire. He ruled as the uncontested king from 208 to 213, but afterwards fell into a dynastic struggle with his brother Artabanus IV, who by 216 was in control of most of the empire, even being acknowledged as the supreme ruler by the Roman Empire. Artabanus IV soon clashed with the Roman emperor Caracalla, whose forces he managed to contain at Nisibis in 217.

Peace was made between the two empires the following year, with the Arsacids keeping most of Mesopotamia. However, Artabanus IV still had to deal with his brother Vologases VI, who continued to mint coins and challenge him. The Sasanian family had meanwhile quickly risen to prominence in Pars, and had now under Ardashir begun to conquer the neighbouring regions and more far territories, such as Kirman. At first, Ardashir I&#x27;s activities did not alarm Artabanus IV, until later, when the Arsacid king finally chose to confront him.

== Early life and co-rule ==

Shapur, as portrayed in the Sasanian rock reliefs, took part in his father&#x27;s war with the Arsacids, including the Battle of Hormozdgan. The battle was fought on 28 April 224, with Artabanus IV being defeated and killed, marking the end of the Arsacid era and the start of 427 years of Sasanian rule. The chief secretary of the deceased Arsacid king, Dad-windad, was afterwards executed by Ardashir I. Ardashir celebrated his victory by having two rock reliefs sculptured at the Sasanian royal city of Ardashir-Khwarrah (present-day Firuzabad) in Pars. The first relief portrays three scenes of personal fighting; starting from the left, a Persian aristocrat seizing a Parthian soldier; Shapur impaling the Parthian minister Dad-windad with his lance; and Ardashir I ousting Artabanus IV. The second relief, conceivably intended to portray the aftermath of the battle, displays the triumphant Ardashir I being given the badge of kingship over a fire shrine from the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda, while Shapur and two other princes are watching from behind. Ardashir considered Shapur &quot;the gentlest, wisest, bravest and ablest of all his children&quot;, and nominated him as his successor in a council amongst the magnates.

==Military career==
===The Eastern Front===
The Eastern provinces of the fledgling Sasanian Empire bordered on the land of the Kushans and the land of the Sakas (roughly today&#x27;s Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan). The military operations of Shapur&#x27;s father Ardashir I had led to the local Kushan and Saka kings offering tribute, and satisfied by this show of submission, Ardashir seems to have refrained from occupying their territories. Al-Tabari alleges he rebuilt the ancient city of Zrang in Sakastan (the land of the Sakas, Sistan), but the only early Sasanian period founding of a new settlement in the East which is certain is the building by Shapur I of Nishapur—&quot;Beautiful (city built) by Shapur&quot;—in Dihistan (former Parthia, apparently lost by the Parthians to the Kushans).

Soon after the death of his father in 241 CE, Shapur felt the need to cut short the campaign they had started in Roman Syria, and reassert Sasanian authority in the East, perhaps because the Kushan and Saka kings were lax in abiding to their tributary status. However, he first had to fight &quot;The Medes of the Mountains&quot;—as we will see possibly in the mountain range of Gilan on the Caspian coast—and after subjugating them, he appointed his son Bahram (the later Bahram I) as their king. He then marched to the East and annexed most of the land of the Kushans, and appointing his son Narseh as Sakanshah—king of the Sakas—in Sistan. In 242 CE, Shapur conquered khwarezm. Shapur could now proudly proclaim that his empire stretched all the way to Peshawar, and his relief in Rag-i-Bibi in present-day Afghanistan confirms this claim. Shapur I claims in his Naqsh-e Rostam inscription possession of the territory of the Kushans (Kūšān šahr) as far as &quot;Purushapura&quot; (Peshawar), suggesting he controlled Bactria and areas as far as the Hindu-Kush or even south of it: 

He seems to have garrisoned the Eastern territories with POW&#x27;s from his previous campaign against the Medes of the Mountains. Agathias claims Bahram II (274–293 CE) later campaigned in the land of the Sakas and appointed his brother Hormizd as its king. When Hormizd revolted, the Panegyrici Latini list his forces as the Sacci (Sakas), the Rufii (Cusii/Kushans) and the Geli (Gelans / Gilaks, the inhabitants of Gilan). Since the Gilaks are obviously out of place among these easterners, and as we know that Shapur I had to fight the Medes of the Mountains first before marching to the land of the Kushans, it is conceivable those Gilaks were the descendants of warriors captured during Shapur I&#x27;s North-western campaign, forcibly drafted into the Sasanian army, and settled as a hereditary garrison in Merv, Nishapur, or Zrang after the conclusion of Shapur&#x27;s north-eastern campaign, the usual Sasanian practise with prisoners of war.

===First Roman war===
Ardashir I had, towards the end of his reign, renewed the war against the Roman Empire, and Shapur I had conquered the Mesopotamian fortresses Nisibis and Carrhae and had advanced into Syria. In 242, the Romans under the father-in-law of their child-emperor Gordian III set out against the Sasanians with &quot;a huge army and great quantity of gold,&quot; (according to a Sasanian rock relief) and wintered in Antioch, while Shapur was occupied with subduing Gilan, Khorasan, and Sistan. There the Roman general Timesitheus fought against the Sasanians and won repeated battles, and recaptured Carrhae and Nisibis, and at last routed a Sasanian army at Resaena, forcing the Persians to restore all occupied cities unharmed to their citizens. &quot;We have penetrated as far as Nisibis, and shall even get to Ctesiphon,&quot; the young emperor Gordian III, who had joined his father-in-law Timesitheus, exultantly wrote to the Senate.

The Romans later invaded eastern Mesopotamia but faced tough resistance from Shapur I who returned from the East. Timesitheus died under uncertain circumstances and was succeeded by Philip the Arab. The young emperor Gordian III went to the Battle of Misiche and was either killed in the battle or murdered by the Romans after the defeat. The Romans then chose Philip the Arab as Emperor. Philip was not willing to repeat the mistakes of previous claimants, and was aware that he had to return to Rome to secure his position with the Senate. Philip concluded a peace with Shapur I in 244; he had agreed that Armenia lay within Persia&#x27;s sphere of influence. He also had to pay an enormous indemnity to the Persians of 500,000 gold denarii. Philip immediately issued coins proclaiming that he had made peace with the Persians (). However, Philip later broke the treaty and seized lost territory.

Shapur I commemorated this victory on several rock reliefs in Pars.

===Second Roman war===
Shapur I invaded Mesopotamia in 250 but again, serious trouble arose in Khorasan and Shapur I had to march over there and settle its affair.

Having settled the affair in Khorasan he resumed the invasion of Roman territories, and later annihilated a Roman force of 60,000 at the Battle of Barbalissos. He then burned and ravaged the Roman province of Syria and all its dependencies.

Shapur I then reconquered Armenia, and incited Anak the Parthian to murder the king of Armenia, Khosrov II. Anak did as Shapur asked, and had Khosrov murdered in 258; yet Anak himself was shortly thereafter murdered by Armenian nobles. Shapur then appointed his son Hormizd I as the &quot;Great King of Armenia&quot;. With Armenia subjugated, Georgia submitted to the Sasanian Empire and fell under the supervision of a Sasanian official. With Georgia and Armenia under control, the Sasanians&#x27; borders on the north were thus secured.

During Shapur&#x27;s invasion of Syria he captured important Roman cities like Antioch. The Emperor Valerian (253–260) marched against him and by 257 Valerian had recovered Antioch and returned the province of Syria to Roman control. The speedy retreat of Shapur&#x27;s troops caused Valerian to pursue the Persians to Edessa, but they were defeated, and Valerian, along with the Roman army that was left, was captured by Shapur Shapur then advanced into Asia Minor and managed to capture Caesarea, deporting hundred upon thousands of Roman citizens to the Sasanian empire. He used these captive Roman citizens to build a dyke near Shushtar, called &quot;Caesar&#x27;s dyke&quot;.

The victory over Valerian is presented in a mural at Naqsh-e Rustam, where Shapur is represented on horseback wearing royal armour and a crown. Before him kneels a man in Roman dress, asking for grace. The same scene is repeated in other rock-face inscriptions.
Christian tradition has Shapur I humiliating Valerian, infamous for his persecution of Christians, by the King of Kings using the Emperor as a footstool to mount his horse, and they claim he later died a miserable death in captivity at the hands of the enemy. However, just as with the above-mentioned Gilaks deported to the East by Shapur, the Persian treatment of prisoners of war was unpleasant but honourable, drafting the captured Romans and their Emperor into their army and deporting them to a remote place, Bishapur in Khuzistan, where they were settled as a garrison and built a weir with bridge for Shapur.

However, the Persian forces were later defeated by the Roman officer Balista and the lord of Palmyra Septimius Odaenathus, who captured the royal harem. Shapur plundered the eastern borders of Syria and returned to Ctesiphon, probably in late 260. In 264 Septimius Odaenathus reached Ctesiphon, but failed to take the city.

The Colossal Statue of Shapur I, which stands in the Shapur Cave, is one of the most impressive sculptures of the Sasanian Empire.

==Interactions with minorities==
Shapur is mentioned many times in the Talmud, in which he is referred to in Jewish Aramaic as &quot;Shabur Malka&quot; (שבור מלכא), meaning &quot;King Shapur&quot;. He had good relations with the Jewish community and was a friend of Shmuel, one of the most famous of the Babylonian &quot;Amoraim&quot;, the Talmudic sages from among the important Jewish communities of Mesopotamia.

==Roman prisoners of war==
Shapur&#x27;s campaigns deprived the Roman Empire of resources while restoring and substantially enriching his own treasury, by deporting many Romans from conquered cities to Sasanian provinces like Khuzestan, Asuristan, and Pars. This influx of deported artisans and skilled workers revitalised Iran&#x27;s domestic commerce.

==Death==
In Bishapur, Shapur died of an illness. His death came in May 270 and he was succeeded by his son, Hormizd I. Two of his other sons, Bahram I and Narseh, would also become kings of the Sasanian Empire, while another son, Shapur Meshanshah, who died before Shapur, sired children who would hold exalted positions within the empire.

==Government==
===Governors during his reign===

Under Shapur, the Sasanian court, including its territories, were much larger than that of his father. Several governors and vassal-kings are mentioned in his inscriptions; Ardashir, governor of Qom; Varzin, governor of Spahan; Tiyanik, governor of Hamadan; Ardashir, governor of Neriz; Narseh, governor of Rind; Friyek, governor of Gundishapur; Rastak, governor of Veh-Ardashir; Amazasp III, king of Iberia. Under Shapur several of his relatives and sons served as governor of Sasanian provinces; Bahram, governor of Gilan; Narseh, governor of Sindh, Sakastan and Turan; Ardashir, governor of Kirman; Hormizd-Ardashir, governor of Armenia; Shapur Meshanshah, governor of Meshan; Ardashir, governor of Adiabene.

===Officials during his reign===
Several names of Shapur&#x27;s officials are carved on his inscription at Naqsh-e Rustam. Many of these were the offspring of the officials who served Shapur&#x27;s father. During the reign of Shapur, a certain Papak served as the commander of the royal guard (&quot;hazarbed&quot;), while Peroz served as the chief of the cavalry (&quot;aspbed&quot;); Vahunam and Shapur served as the director of the clergy; Kirdisro served as viceroy of the empire (&quot;bidaxsh&quot;); Vardbad served as the &quot;chief of services&quot;; Hormizd served as the chief scribe; Naduk served as &quot;the chief of the prison&quot;; Papak served as the &quot;gate keeper&quot;; Mihrkhwast served as the treasurer; Shapur served as the commander of the army; Arshtat Mihran served as the secretary; Zik served as the &quot;master of ceremonies&quot;.

=== Army ===

Under Shapur, the Iranian military experienced a resurgence after a rather long decline in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, which gave the Romans the opportunity to undertake expeditions into the Near East and Mesopotamia during the end of the Parthian Empire. Yet, the military was essentially the same as that of the Parthians; the same Parthians nobles who served the Arsacid royal family, now served the Sasanians, forming the majority of the Sasanian army. However, the Sasanians seem to have employed more cataphracts who were equipped with lighter chain-mail armour resembling that of the Romans.

Although Iranian society was greatly militarised and its elite designated themselves as a &quot;warrior nobility&quot; (&quot;arteshtaran&quot;), it still had a significantly smaller population, was more impoverished, and was a less centralised state compared to the Roman Empire. As a result, the Sasanian shahs had access to fewer full-time fighters, and depended on recruits from the nobility instead. Some exceptions were the royal cavalry bodyguard, garrison soldiers, and units recruited from places outside Iran. The bulk of the nobility included the powerful Parthian noble families (known as the &quot;wuzurgan&quot;) that were centred on the Iranian plateau. They served as the backbone of the Sasanian feudal army and were largely autonomous. The Parthian nobility worked for the Sasanian shah for personal benefit, personal oath, and, conceivably, a common awareness of the &quot;Aryan&quot; (Iranian) kinship they shared with their Persian overlords.

Use of war elephants is also attested under Shapur, who made use of them to demolish the city of Hatra. He may also have used them against Valerian, as attested in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;).

===Monuments===

Shapur I left other reliefs and rock inscriptions. A relief at Naqsh-e Rajab near Estakhr is accompanied by a Greek translation. Here Shapur I calls himself &quot;the Mazdayasnan (worshipper of Ahuramazda), the divine Shapur, King of Kings of the Iranians, and non-Iranians, of divine descent, son of the Mazdayasnan, the divine Ardashir, King of Kings of the Aryans, grandson of the divine king Papak&quot;. Another long inscription at Estakhr mentions the King&#x27;s exploits in archery in the presence of his nobles.

From his titles we learn that Shapur I claimed sovereignty over the whole earth, although in reality his domain extended little farther than that of Ardashir I.
Shapur I built the great town Gundishapur near the old Achaemenid capital Susa, and increased the fertility of the district with a dam and irrigation system—built by Roman prisoners—that redirected part of the Karun River. The barrier is still called &quot;Band-e Kaisar&quot;, &quot;the mole of the Caesar&quot;. He is also responsible for building the city of Bishapur, with the labours of Roman soldiers captured after the defeat of Valerian in 260. Shapur also built a town named Pushang in Khorasan.

===Religious policy===
In all records Shapur calls himself &quot;mzdysn&quot; (&quot;Mazda-worshipping&quot;). His inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht recounts his wars and religious establishments to the same extent. He believed that he had a responsibility; &quot;For the reason, therefore, that the gods have so made us their instrument (dstkrt), and that by the help of the gods we have sought out for ourselves, and hold, all these nations (štry) for that reason we have also founded, province by province, many Varahrān fires (ʾtwry wlhlʾn), and we have dealt piously with many Magi (mowmard), and we have made great worship of the gods.&quot; According to the Zoroastrian priest Kartir, Shapur treated the Zoroastrians generously, and permitted members of their clergy to follow him on his expeditions against the Romans. According to the historian Prods Oktor Skjærvø, Shapur was a &quot;lukewarm Zoroastrian&quot;.

During the reign of Shapur, Manichaeism, a new religion founded by the Iranian prophet Mani, flourished. Mani was treated well by Shapur, and in 242, the prophet joined the Sasanian court, where he tried to convert Shapur by dedicating his only work written in Middle Persian, known as the &quot;Shabuhragan&quot;. Shapur, however, did not convert to Manichaeism and remained a Zoroastrian.

== Coinage and imperial ideology ==

While the titulage of Ardashir was &quot;King of Kings of Iran(ians)&quot;, Shapur slightly changed it, adding the phrase &quot;and non-Iran(ians)&quot;. The extended title demonstrates the incorporation of new territory into the empire, however what was precisely seen as &quot;non-Iran(ian)&quot; (&quot;aneran&quot;) is not certain. Although this new title was used on his inscriptions, it was almost never used on his coinage. The title first became regularised under Hormizd I.

== Cultural depictions ==
Shapur appears in Harry Sidebottom&#x27;s historical fiction novel series as one of the enemies of the series protagonist Marcus Clodius Ballista, career soldier in a third-century Roman army.

<text>Shapur II ( , 309–379), also known as Shapur the Great, was the tenth King of Kings (Shahanshah) of Sasanian Iran. He took the title at birth and held it until his death at age 70, making him the longest-reigning monarch in Iranian history. He was the son of Hormizd II ().

His reign saw the military resurgence of the country and the expansion of its territory, which marked the start of the first Sasanian golden era. Thus, along with Shapur I, Kavad I and Khosrow I, he is regarded as one of the most illustrious Sasanian kings. His three direct successors, on the other hand, were less successful. At the age of 16, he launched enormously successful military campaigns against Arab insurrections and tribes, who knew him as &quot;Dhu&#x27;l-Aktaf&quot; &#x27;he who pierces shoulders&#x27;.

Shapur II pursued a harsh religious policy. Under his reign, the collection of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, was completed, heresy and apostasy were punished, and Christians were persecuted. The latter was a reaction against the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. Shapur II, like Shapur I, was amicable towards Jews, who lived in relative freedom and gained many advantages in his period (&quot;see also Rava&quot;). At the time of Shapur&#x27;s death, the Sasanian Empire was stronger than ever, with its enemies to the east pacified and Armenia under Sasanian control.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Shapur&quot; was a popular name in Sasanian Iran, being used by three Sasanian monarchs and other notables of the Sasanian era. Derived from Old Iranian * &#x27;son of a king&#x27;, it must initially have been a title, which became—at least in the late 2nd century AD—a personal name. It appears in the list of Arsacid kings in some Arabic-Persian sources; however, this is anachronistic. Shapur is rendered variously in other languages: Greek &quot;Sapur&quot;, &quot;Sabour&quot; and &quot;Sapuris&quot;; Latin &quot;Sapores&quot; and &quot;Sapor&quot;; Arabic &quot;Sābur&quot; and &quot;Šābur&quot;; New Persian &quot;Šāpur&quot;, &quot;Šāhpur&quot;, &quot;Šahfur&quot;.

== Accession ==

When Hormizd II died in 309, he was succeeded by his son Adur Narseh, who, after a brief reign which lasted few months, was killed by some of the nobles of the empire. They then blinded Hormizd&#x27;s second son, and imprisoned the third (Hormizd, who afterwards escaped to the Roman Empire). The throne was reserved for another one of Hormizd II&#x27;s children, Shapur II; some sources say that Shapur was born forty days after his father&#x27;s death while others say that he was infant at the time. A legend exists that Shapur was crowned while still unborn, with the crown being placed upon his pregnant mother&#x27;s womb. This story was known to Western historians such as Agathias (6th century), who writes that the magi had prophesied that the child would be a boy. Modern historians C. E. Bosworth and Alireza Shapour Shahbazi consider this story to be fictional. The sex of the infant could not have been known before Shapur&#x27;s birth, writes Bosworth. The crowning of the infant Shapur after the elimination of his older brothers was a means for the nobility and priesthood to gain greater control of the empire. They maintained their control until 325, when Shapur reached maturity at the age of sixteen.

==War with the Arabs (325)==

During the childhood of Shapur II, Arab nomads raided the Sasanian homeland of Pars, particularly the district of Ardashir-Khwarrah and the shore of the Persian Gulf. At the age of 16, Shapur II led an expedition against the Arabs; primarily campaigning against the Iyad tribe in Asoristan and thereafter he crossed the Persian Gulf, reaching al-Khatt, modern Qatif, or present eastern Saudi Arabia. He then attacked the Banu Tamim in the Hajar Mountains. Shapur II reportedly killed a large number of the Arab population and destroyed their water supplies by stopping their wells with sand.

After having dealt with the Arabs of eastern Arabia, he continued his expedition into western Arabia and Syria, where he attacked several cities—he even went as far as Medina. Because of his cruel way of dealing with the Arabs, he was called &quot;Dhu&#x27;l-Aktaf&quot; (&quot;he who pierces shoulders&quot;) by them. Not only did Shapur II pacify the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, but he also pushed many Arab tribes further deep into the Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, he also deported some Arab tribes by force; the Taghlib to Bahrain and al-Khatt; the Banu Abdul Qays and Banu Tamim to Hajar; the Banu Bakr to Kirman, and the Banu Hanzalah to a place near Hormizd-Ardashir. Shapur II, in order to prevent the Arabs from making more raids into his country, ordered the construction of a wall near al-Hira, which became known as (&quot;wall of the Arabs&quot;).

The Zoroastrian scripture &quot;Bundahishn&quot; also mentions the Arabian campaign of Shapur II:
With Eastern Arabia more firmly under Sasanian control, and with the establishment of Sasanian garrison troops, the way for Zoroastrianism was opened. Pre-Islamic Arabian poets often makes mention of Zoroastrian practices, which they must have made contact with either in Asoristan or Eastern Arabia. The Lakhmid ruler Imru&#x27; al-Qays ibn &#x27;Amr, who was originally a vassal of the Sasanians, may have suffered from Shapur II&#x27;s raids in Peninsula. He seemingly swore fealty to the Romans, possibly after the incident.

== War with the Romans ==

=== Objectives ===
Ever since the &quot;humiliating&quot; Peace of Nisibis concluded between Shapur&#x27;s grandfather Narseh and the Roman emperor Diocletian in 298, the borders between the two empires had changed largely in favor of the Romans, who in the treaty received a handful of provinces in Mesopotamia, changing the border from the Euphrates to the Tigris, close to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. The Romans also received control over the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia, and gained control over parts of upper Media in Iran proper. Shapur&#x27;s primary objective was thus to nullify the treaty, which he spent much of his reign trying to accomplish.

Another cause for Shapur&#x27;s wars against the Romans was their attempts to meddle in the domestic affairs of the Sasanian Empire and hurt Shapur&#x27;s kingship by supporting his brother Hormizd, who had been well received at the Roman court by Constantine the Great and made a cavalry commander. Shapur had made fruitless attempts to satisfy his brother, even having his wife sent to him, who had originally helped him escape imprisonment. However, Hormizd had already become an avid philhellene during his stay with the Romans, with whom he felt at home. Another reason was Constantine&#x27;s declaration of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire in 337. He had also declared himself the defender of all the Christians in the world, including those living in the Sasanian realm. 

=== Early campaigns and first war against the Romans ===

In 337, after the accession of Constantius II to the Roman throne, Shapur II, provoked by the Roman rulers&#x27; backing of Armenia and the Armenian kingdom&#x27;s earlier conversion to Christianity, broke the peace concluded in 298 between Narseh (293–302) and Diocletian (284–305), which had been observed for forty years. Most of the fighting during this campaign occurred in Roman Mesopotamia, where Roman fortifications impeded the Persian advance. Nevertheless, Shapur was able to take some forts, such as Vitra. Persian forces also devastated Armenia and captured and blinded the Armenian king Tiran, perhaps in 350. Shapur besieged the Roman fortress city of Nisibis in Mesopotamia thrice (in 338, 346, and 350) and was repulsed each time. During this campaign, the sole engagement between the sides&#x27; main armies was the Battle of Singara (modern-day Sinjar, Iraq) in 344, where Persian forces feinted a retreat and inflicted significant losses on the Roman army. Neither side managed to achieve a decisive advantage, and an invasion of Central Asian nomads in the east forced Shapur to abandon his campaign against Rome by 350. These nomads were likely the Kidarites, who were threatening the Gupta Empire (320–500 CE) in India at the same time. After an extended campaign against the nomads, Shapur forced their king, Grumbates, into an alliance, thus gaining a new ally against the Romans. In particular, Grumbates&#x27;s forces joined the Persians in the Siege of Amida in 359.

=== Second war against the Romans and invasion of Armenia ===
In 356, Shapur rejected a peace overture by Constantius, replying that Rome should return Armenia and other territories lost by Persia in the Treaty of Nisibis. In 359, Shapur II invaded southern Armenia and besieged the fortress of Amida (now Diyarbakır, Turkey). He was joined by King Grumbates&#x27;s forces and other allies. Amida surrendered after a seventy-three-day siege. The city was plundered and its inhabitants were deported to Khuzistan. The delay forced Shapur to halt operations for the winter. Early the following spring he continued his operations against the Roman fortresses, capturing Singara and Bezabde (Cizre?), again at a heavy cost. In the next year Constantius II launched a counterattack, having spent the winter making massive preparations in Constantinople; Shapur, who had meanwhile lost the aid of his Asianic allies, avoided battle, but left strong garrisons in all the fortresses which he had captured. Constantius laid siege to Bezabde, but proved incapable of taking it, and retired on the approach of winter to Antioch, where he died soon after.
Constantius was succeeded by his cousin Julian (361–363), who came to the throne determined to avenge the recent Roman reverses in the east. Though Shapur attempted an honorable reconciliation, warned of the capabilities which Julian had displayed in wars against the Alemanni in Gaul, the emperor dismissed negotiation.

In 363 Julian, at the head of a strong army, advanced to Shapur&#x27;s capital city of Ctesiphon and defeated a presumably larger Sasanian force at the Battle of Ctesiphon; however, he was unable to take the fortified city, or engage with the main Persian army under Shapur II that was approaching. Julian was killed by the enemy in a skirmish during his retreat back to Roman territory. His successor Jovian (363–364) made an ignominious peace in which the districts beyond the Tigris which had been acquired in 298 were given to the Persians along with Nisibis and Singara, and the Romans promised to interfere no more in Armenia. The great success is represented in the rock sculptures near the town Bishapur in Pars (Stolze, &quot;Persepolis&quot;, p. 141); under the hooves of the king&#x27;s horse lies the body of an enemy, probably Julian, and a supplicant Roman, the Emperor Jovian, asks for peace.

According to the peace treaty between Shapur and Jovian, Georgia and Armenia were to be ceded to the Sasanians, and the Romans forbidden from further involvement in the affairs of Armenia. The Armenian King Arshak II, who had joined Julian&#x27;s campaign, was lured to Persia and imprisoned in the Castle of Oblivion (Armenian: ) in Khuzistan. Shapur destroyed many towns in Armenia and deported their inhabitants to Persia. He persecuted the local Christians, erected fire temples and forced conversion to Zoroastrianism. The Persians were assisted in Armenia by the magnates Meruzhan Artsruni and Vahan Mamikonian, who were made governors of the country and one of whom was given Shapur&#x27;s own sister in marriage. However, the Armenian nobles resisted him successfully, secretly supported by the Romans, who sent King Pap, the son of Arshak II, into Armenia. Shapur personally invaded Armenia in response to Pap&#x27;s return, although Pap was restored to the Armenian throne again with the help of a Roman army in approximately spring 370. Persian forces were defeated by a joint Roman-Armenian army in 371, and an army led by Shapur himself was defeated in another battle on the eastern border of Armenia. Eventually, Pap was suspected of colluding with the Persians and was assassinated in 375 by the order of the Roman emperor Valens. Shapur and Valens negotiated inconclusively over the status of Armenia until 377, and Valens&#x27;s defeat and death at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 ended Roman presence in Armenia. Armenia was left in peace for the time being. The country was later partitioned between Rome and Persia in 387, under Shapur&#x27;s son Shapur III. 

In Georgia, then known as Iberia, where the Sasanians were also given control, Shapur II installed Aspacures II of Iberia in the east; however, in western Georgia, Valens also succeeded in setting up his own king, Sauromaces II of Iberia.

Shapur II had conducted great hosts of captives from the Roman territory into his dominions, most of whom were settled in Elam. Here he rebuilt Susa—after having killed the city&#x27;s rebellious inhabitants.

==War in the East==
===Expansion into India (c. 350–358 CE)===
====Gandhara and Punjab====

In the east around 350 CE, Shapur II gained the upper hand against the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom and took control of large territories in areas now known as Afghanistan and Pakistan, possibly as a consequence of the destruction of the Kushano-Sasanians by the Chionites. The Kushano-Sasanian still ruled in the north. Important finds of Sasanian coinage beyond the Indus river in the city of Taxila only start with the reigns of Shapur II () and Shapur III (), suggesting that the expansion of Sasanian control beyond the Indus was the result of the wars of Shapur II &quot;with the Chionites and Kushans&quot; from 350 to 358 CE as described by Ammianus Marcellinus. During the last phase of the reign of Shapur II, a Sasanian mint was established south of the Hindu Kush, the role of which was probably to pay local troops. The Sasanians probably maintained control until Bactria fell to the Kidarites under their ruler Kidara around 360 CE, and Kabulistan fell to the Alchon Huns circa 385 CE.

====Sindh====
In the area of Sindh, from Multan to the mouth of the Indus river, an important series of gold coins started to be issued on the model of the coinage of Shapur II, and would continue down to Peroz I. The coins are not the usual Sasanian imperial type, and the legend around the portrait tends to be degraded Middle Persian in the Pahlavi script, but they have the Brahmi script character &quot;Sri&quot; (meaning &quot;Lord&quot;) in front of the portrait of the King. The coins suggest some sort of Sasanian control of Sind from the time of Shapur II, and a recognition of Sasanian overlordship, but the precise extent of the Sasanian presence or influence is unknown.

===Loss of Bactria to nomadic invaders (c. 360 CE)===
Confrontations with nomadic tribes from Central Asia soon started to occur. Ammianus Marcellinus reports that in 356 CE, Shapur II was taking his winter quarters on his eastern borders, &quot;repelling the hostilities of the bordering tribes&quot; of the Chionites and the Euseni (&quot;Euseni&quot; is usually amended to &quot;Cuseni&quot;, meaning the Kushans), finally making a treaty of alliance with the Chionites and the Gelani in 358 CE.

From around 360 CE, however, during his reign, the Sasanids lost the control of Bactria to invaders from the north, first the Kidarites, then the Hephthalites and the Alchon Huns, who would follow up with the invasion of India. These invaders initially issued coins based on Sasanian designs. Various coins minted in Bactria and based on a Sasanian designs are known, often with busts imitating Sasanian kings Shapur II (r. 309 to 379 CE) and Shapur III (r. 383 to 388 CE), adding the Alchon Tamgha and the name &quot;Alchono&quot; in Bactrian script on the obverse, and with attendants to a fire altar on the reverse.

== Death and succession ==
Shapur died in 379 and was succeeded by his slightly younger brother Ardashir II, who agreed to rule till Shapur&#x27;s son Shapur III reached adulthood. At the time of Shapur&#x27;s death, the Sasanian Empire was stronger than it had ever been, and it was also considerably larger than when he came to the throne, the eastern and western enemies were pacified and Persia had gained control over Armenia. He is regarded as one of the most important Sasanian kings along with Shapur I and Khosrow I, and could after a long period of instability regain the old strength of the Empire. His three successors, however, were less successful than he. Furthermore, his death marked the start of a 125-year-long conflict between the &quot;wuzurgan&quot;, a powerful group of nobility, and the kings, who both struggled for power over Iran.

== Religious policy ==
Under Shapur II&#x27;s reign, the collection of the Avesta was completed, heresy and apostasy punished, and the Christians persecuted (see Abdecalas, Acepsimas of Hnaita and Abda of Kashkar). This was a reaction against the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine.

According to Armenian and primary sources, the Sasanian shahs revered the sun and the moon, with Roman sources stating that Shapur II asserted to be the &quot;brother of the Sun and the Moon&quot; (Latin: &quot;frater Solis et Lunae&quot;). This is however not mentioned in Sasanian sources, which implies that there are two possibilities; one that it is regarding about the angelic divinity Mithra, whilst the other one being that it may be an Indo-Iranian characteristic where the shahs considered their ancestors descendants of Manuchehr (Indic Manu) and his father Wiwahvant (Indic Vivasvant), who were in India associated with the Moon and the Sun.

Shapur&#x27;s own religious beliefs do not seem to have been very strict; he restored the family cult of Anahita in Istakhr and was possibly an adherent of Zurvanism as well as promoting the official orthodox variant of Zoroastrianism.

=== Towards Christians ===
Initially, Shapur II was not hostile to his Christian subjects, who were led by Shemon Bar Sabbae, the Patriarch of the Church of the East. However, the conversion of Constantine the Great to Christianity caused Shapur to start distrusting his Christian subjects. He started seeing them as agents of a foreign enemy. The wars between the Sasanian and Roman empires turned Shapur&#x27;s mistrust into hostility. After the death of Constantine, Shapur II, who had been preparing for a war against the Romans for several years, imposed a double tax on his Christian subjects to finance the conflict. Shemon, however, refused to pay the double tax. Shapur started pressuring Shemon and his clergy to convert to Zoroastrianism, which they refused to do. It was during this period the &#x27;cycle of the martyrs&#x27; began during which &#x27;many thousands of Christians&#x27; were put to death. During the following years, Shemon&#x27;s successors, Shahdost and Barba&#x27;shmin, were also martyred.

Barbasceminus, bishop of Seleucia and Ctesiphon from 342, was executed on 14 January 346 with sixteen of his clergy.
A near-contemporary fifth-century Christian work, the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of Sozomen, contains considerable detail on the Persian Christians martyred under Shapur II. Sozomen estimates the total number of Christians killed as follows:

== Imperial beliefs and numismatics ==
According to Ammianus Marcellinus, Shapur II fought the Romans in order to &quot;re-conquer what had belonged to his ancestor&quot;. It is not known who Shapur II thought his ancestor was, probably the Achaemenids or the legendary Kayanian dynasty. During the reign of Shapur II, the title of &quot;the divine Mazda-worshipping, king of kings of the Iranians, whose image/seed is from the gods&quot; disappears from the coins that were minted. He was also the last Sasanian king to claim lineage from the gods.

Under Shapur II, coins were minted in copper, silver and gold, however, a great amount of the copper coins were made on Roman planchet, which is most likely from the riches that the Sasanians took from the Romans. The weight of the coins also changed from 7.20 g to 4.20 g.

== Building activity ==
Besides the construction of the &quot;war-i tāzigān&quot; near al-Hira, Shapur II is also known to have created several other cities. He created a royal city called Eranshahr-Shapur, where he settled Roman prisoners of war. He also rebuilt and repopulated Nisibis in 363 with people from Istakhr and Spahan. In Asoristan, he founded Wuzurg-Shapur (&quot;Great Shapur&quot;), a city on the west side of the Tigris. He also rebuilt Susa after having destroyed it when suppressing a revolt, renaming it Eran-Khwarrah-Shapur (&quot;Iran&#x27;s glory [built by] Shapur&quot;).

==Offspring==
Besides his son Shapur III, Shapur II had a daughter, Zurvandukht, who was named after Zurvan, a deity in Zoroastrianism. She is attested only in the 5th-century Armenian history &quot;Buzandaran Patmutʻiwnkʻ&quot; as the wife of the Armenian king Khosrov IV.

<doc id="140703" wikidata="Q310267" url="?curid=140703" title="Shapur III">
<text>Shapur III ( ), was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 383 to 388. He was the son of Shapur II () and succeeded his uncle Ardashir II (). 

His reign was largely uneventful; to the west, a dispute with the Romans over Armenia was eventually settled through diplomacy, partitioning the area between the two empires in a manner which left most of it under Sasanian control. To the east, Shapur III lost control of the important mint city Kabul to the Alchon Huns.

He is notable for having a rock relief carved at Taq-e Bostan, depicting a scene of him along with his father. He was the penultimate monarch to have a rock relief carved, the last one being Khosrow II (), who mimicked and magnified Shapur III&#x27;s work. The king died in 388, after reigning for five years. He was crushed by the collapsing weight of his own tent, after some conspiring nobles had cut its ropes. His son Bahram IV succeeded him.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Shapur&quot; was a popular name in Sasanian Iran, being used by three Sasanian monarchs and other notables of the Sasanian era and its later periods. Derived from Old Iranian &quot;*xšayaθiya.puθra&quot; (&quot;son of a king&quot;), it must initially have been a title, which became—at least in the late 2nd century AD—a personal name. It appears in the list of Arsacid kings in some Arabic-Persian sources, however, this is anachronistic. Shapur is transliterated in other languages as; Greek &quot;Sapur&quot;, &quot;Sabour&quot; and &quot;Sapuris&quot;; Latin &quot;Sapores&quot; and &quot;Sapor&quot;; Arabic &quot;Sābur&quot; and &quot;Šābur&quot;; New Persian &quot;Šāpur&quot;, &quot;Šāhpur&quot;, &quot;Šahfur&quot;.

==Background and accession==
Shapur III was the son of Shapur II (). In 379, Shapur II designated his half-brother Ardashir II as his successor on the condition that he would abdicate when his son reached adulthood. Ardashir II&#x27;s reign lasted until 383, when he was killed or deposed by the Iranian nobility. The reason behind this was due to his continuation of Shapur II&#x27;s policy of restricting the authority of power-hungry nobles. Shapur III then succeeded him; according to the narratives included in the history of al-Tabari (died 923), he was well received by his subjects due to the crown being given to an offspring of Shapur II. Shapur III declared to them in his accession speech, that he would not allow deceit, greed or self-righteousness at his court. However, to the nobility this was unacceptable.

== Reign ==

Armenia had been constantly the source of war between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. In 378/9, Shapur II had achieved Iranian hegemony over the country after its regent Manuel Mamikonian submitted to him. A force 10,000 of Iranian soldiers led by general Surena were dispatched to Armenia. Surena was given the title of &quot;marzban&quot; (margrave), which indicates that Armenia was now a Sasanian province. Under Ardashir II, however, Manuel rebelled and succeeded in maintaining independence against both the Iranians and Romans in the early 380s. However, just before his death in 385/386, he seemingly placed Armenia under Roman protection. With his death, many Armenian &quot;nakharars&quot; (grandees) revolted against the Arsacid king Arshak III () and appealed to Shapur III for another king. Shapur III responded by crowning Khosrov IV as king, and gave him his sister Zurvandukht in marriage. He then sent an invasion force into Armenia, which occupied most of the country. Arshak III was forced to withdraw to the western region of Acilisene, where he awaited Roman reinforcements.

Instead of declaring war, Iran and Rome agreed to come to terms through diplomacy. An agreement was made to partition Armenia. The boundary stretched through Theodosiopolis in the north and Amida in the south, which meant that most of Armenia remained in Sasanian hands, including the two Arsacid capitals of Artaxata and Dvin. With this treaty, the Romans also fully acknowledged Iranian hegemony over all of Iberia. When this treaty exactly took place is unsure; most scholars believe the treaty was made in 387, whilst a few others state 384 or even in 389 or 390. Both sides were to cooperate in the defense of the Caucasus, with the Romans agreeing to pay the Iranians roughly 500 lbs (226 kg) of gold at irregular intervals. While the Romans saw this payment as political allocations, the Iranians saw it as tribute. 

In order to further reduce the political and economic power of Iranian Armenia, Shapur III deprived the country of several of its provinces; Artsakh, Utik, Shakashen, Gardman and Kolt were given to Caucasian Albania (ruled by a collateral line of the Arsacids); Gugark (ruled by the Mihranids) became subject to Iberia; and Arzanene (ruled by a &quot;bidaxsh&quot;, i.e. margrave), Paytakaran, Korjayk (Corduene) and Parskahayk were incorporated into Iran. Arshak III soon died, which made the Romans abolish their branch of the Arsacid monarchy and create the province of Western Armenia. As a result many of the &quot;nakharars&quot; who had followed him subsequently rejoined the Iranians. The Arsacid monarchy in Iranian Armenia continued to last for a few decades, until its abolishment by king Bahram V () in 428. Shapur III&#x27;s religious tolerance towards the Christians is reported by the historians Elishe and John of Ephesus. According to the former, Shapur III granted the Armenians lavish gifts and exempted their Church from royal taxation.

Besides the dispute over Armenia, Shapur III seems to have clashed with the Alchon Huns to the east; coinage indicates that the Alchon Huns seized Kabul from him sometime before 388. They duplicated the same coin mints issued by Shapur III, with the only difference being the newly added Bactrian inscription &quot;αλχοννο&quot; (&quot;alxanno&quot;), added to display their takeover of Sasanian territory. The loss of the city was a major blow, as it had been a center of coin manufacture since the 360s.

Shapur III died in 388, after reigning for five years. He died when some nobles cut the ropes of a large tent that he had erected in one of his palace courts, so that the tent fell on top of him. He was succeeded by his son Bahram IV. Another of his sons, Yazdegerd I, later succeeded Bahram IV in 399.

== Coinage ==

Under Shapur III and Bahram IV, the administrative program for Sasanian coinage substantially changed. More coins were minted, with administrative areas often producing dies for several types of mints. Shapur III was one of the few Sasanian kings to mint coins of himself not wearing a crown and &quot;korymbos&quot;, but only a diadem. This demonstrates that the diadem was the most important headgear of the Sasanian king. On his coins, he used the typical title of &quot;Mazdēsn bay Šābuhr šāhān šāh Ērān ud Anērān kēčihr az yazdān&quot; (&quot;the Mazda-worshiping, divine Shapur, King of Kings of Iran(ians) and non-Iran(ians), whose image/brilliance is from the gods&quot;).

== Rock relief ==

Shapur III ordered the creation of a rock relief located at the site of Taq-e Bostan near present-day Kermanshah. Its design was that in the form of an iwan. Two Sasanian kings are portrayed, with inscriptions identifying the king to the left as Shapur III, and the king to the right as Shapur II. While the king to the right is wearing Shapur II&#x27;s crown, the one to left does properly duplicate the crown of Shapur III. Unlike other Sasanian reliefs, the one created under Shapur III was not sculptured at the surface of a rock face, but at the back of a barrel vaulted area. This style was mimicked and magnified in the 7th century by the Sasanian monarch Khosrow II ().

== Klimova plate ==
The &quot;Klimova Plate&quot; (part of the Klimova Treasure), is a silver vessel located in the Hermitage Museum, which depicts a king slaying a leopard. His crown is highly identical to that of Shapur III. The crown is topped by the traditional &quot;korymbos&quot;, a globe-like cloth. The king is wearing a dress identical to that of the plate of Yazdegerd I located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A Sogdian inscription from the 7th or 8th-century is inscribed on its reverse. While Harper and Meyers in their book &quot;Silver Vessels of the Sasanian Period: Royal Imagery&quot; (1981) consider the king to possibly represent Shapur III, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity&quot; (2018) considers it be him.

==Onyx seal==
One of the wives of Shapur III, named Yazdan-Friy Shapur, has been immortalized by an onyx seal of remarkable quality, where she is shown wearing the horns of a ram. The seal is now in the Cabinet des Médailles, France.

<doc id="140704" wikidata="Q177716" url="?curid=140704" title="Pogrom">
<text>A pogrom is a violent riot incited with the aim of massacring or expelling an ethnic or religious group, particularly Jews. The term entered the English language from Russian to describe late 19th- and early 20th-century attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire (mostly within the Pale of Settlement). Retrospectively, similar attacks against Jews which occurred in other times and places were renamed pogroms. Sometimes the word is used to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish groups. The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incident, at times leading to, or culminating in, massacres.

Significant pogroms in the Russian Empire included the Odessa pogroms, Warsaw pogrom (1881), Kishinev pogrom (1903), Kiev pogrom (1905), and Białystok pogrom (1906). After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, several pogroms occurred amidst the power struggles in Eastern Europe, including the Lwów pogrom (1918) and Kiev pogroms (1919).
The most significant pogrom which occurred in Nazi Germany was the 1938 Kristallnacht. At least 91 Jews were killed, a further thirty thousand arrested and subsequently incarcerated in concentration camps, a thousand synagogues burned, and over seven thousand Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged. Notorious pogroms of World War II included the 1941 Farhud in Iraq, the July 1941 Iași pogrom in Romaniain which over 13,200 Jews were killedas well as the Jedwabne pogrom in German-occupied Poland. Post-World War II pogroms included the 1945 Tripoli pogrom, the 1946 Kielce pogrom, the 1947 Aleppo pogrom, and the 1955 Istanbul pogrom.

This type of violence has also occurred to other ethnic and religious minorities. Examples include the 1984 Sikh massacre in which 3,000 Sikhs were killed and the 2002 Gujarat pogrom against Indian Muslims.

In 2008, two attacks in the Occupied West Bank by Israeli Jewish settlers on Palestinian Arabs were labeled as pogroms by then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The Huwara pogrom was a common name for the 2023 Israeli settler attack on the Palestinian town of Huwara in February 2023. In 2023, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial referred to the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel as a pogrom.

== The word &quot;pogrom&quot; ==


=== Etymology ===

First recorded in English in 1882, the Russian word (, ) is derived from the common prefix () and the verb (, ) meaning &#x27;to destroy, wreak havoc, demolish violently&#x27;. The noun &quot;pogrom&quot;, which has a relatively short history, is used in English and many other languages as a loanword, possibly borrowed from Yiddish (where the word takes the form ). Its modern widespread circulation began with the antisemitic violence in the Russian Empire in 1881–1883.

=== Usage of the word ===
According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;the term is usually applied to attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [and] the first extensive pogroms followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881&quot;. The &quot;Wiley-Blackwell Dictionary of Modern European History Since 1789&quot; states that pogroms &quot;were antisemitic disturbances that periodically occurred within the tsarist empire.&quot; However, the term is widely used to refer to many events which occurred prior to the Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire. Historian of Russian Jewry John Klier writes in &quot;Russians, Jews, and the Pogroms of 1881–1882&quot;: &quot;By the twentieth century, the word &#x27;pogrom&#x27; had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews.&quot; Abramson points out that &quot;in mainstream usage the word has come to imply an act of antisemitism&quot;, since while &quot;Jews have not been the only group to suffer under this phenomenon ... historically Jews have been frequent victims of such violence.&quot;

The term is also used in reference to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly, some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of &quot;pogroms&quot;. Reviewing the word&#x27;s uses in scholarly literature, historian Werner Bergmann proposes that a pogrom should be &quot;defined as a &quot;unilateral, nongovernmental&quot; form of &quot;collective&quot; violence that is &quot;initiated by the majority population&quot; against a largely defenseless minority ethnic group, and occurring when the &quot;majority&quot; expect the state to provide them [sic] with no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority&quot;. However, Bergmann adds that in Western usage, the word&#x27;s &quot;anti-Semitic overtones&quot; have been retained. Historian David Engel supports this view, writing that while &quot;there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label [pogrom],&quot; the majority of the incidents which are &quot;habitually&quot; described as pogroms took place in societies that were significantly divided by ethnicity or religion where the violence was committed by members of the higher-ranking group against members of a stereotyped lower-ranking group with which they expressed some complaint, and where the members of the higher-ranking group justified their acts of violence by claiming that the law of the land would not be used to prevent the alleged complaint.

There is no universally accepted set of characteristics which define the term pogrom. Klier writes that &quot;when applied indiscriminately to events in Eastern Europe, the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that &#x27;pogroms&#x27; were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features.&quot; Use of the term pogrom to refer to events in 1918–19 in Polish cities (including the Kielce pogrom, the Pinsk massacre and the Lwów pogrom) was specifically avoided in the 1919 Morgenthau Report; the word &quot;excesses&quot; was employed instead because the authors argued that the use of the term &quot;pogrom&quot; required a situation to be antisemitic rather than political in nature, which meant that it was inapplicable to the conditions which exist in a war zone. Media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 Crown Heights riot caused public controversy. In 2008, two separate attacks in the West Bank by Israeli Jewish settlers on Palestinian Arabs were characterized as pogroms by then Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert.

Werner Bergmann suggests that all such incidents have a particularly unifying characteristic: &quot;By the &quot;collective attribution&quot; of a threat, the pogrom differs from other forms of violence, such as lynchings, which are directed at individual members of a minority group, while the &quot;imbalance of power&quot; in favor of the rioters distinguishes pogroms from other forms of riots (food riots, race riots or &#x27;communal riots&#x27; between evenly matched groups); and again, the &quot;low level of organization&quot; separates them from vigilantism, terrorism, massacre and genocide&quot;.

== History of anti-Jewish pogroms ==
The first recorded anti-Jewish riots took place in Alexandria in the year 38 CE, followed by the more known riot of 66 CE. Other notable events took place in Europe during the Middle Ages. Jewish communities were targeted in 1189 and 1190 in England and throughout Europe during the Crusades and the Black Death of 1348–1350, including in Toulon, Erfurt, Basel, Aragon, Flanders and Strasbourg. Some 510 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period, extending further to the Brussels massacre of 1370. On Holy Saturday of 1389, a riot began in Prague that led to the burning of the Jewish quarter, the killing of many Jews, and the suicide of many Jews trapped in the main synagogue; the number of dead was estimated at 400–500 men, women and children. Attacks against Jews also took place in Barcelona and other Spanish cities during the massacre of 1391.

The brutal murders of Jews and Poles occurred during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648–1657 in present-day Ukraine, then within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Modern historians give estimates of the scale of the murders by Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Cossacks ranging between 40,000 and 100,000 men, women and children, or perhaps many more.

An outbreak of violence against Jews (Hep-Hep riots) occurred at the beginning of the 19th century in reaction to Jewish emancipation in the German Confederation.

=== Pogroms in the Russian Empire ===
The Russian Empire, which previously had very few Jews, acquired territories in the Russian Partition that contained large Jewish populations, during the military partitions of Poland in 1772, 1793 and 1795. In conquered territories, a new political entity called the Pale of Settlement was formed in 1791 by Catherine the Great. Most Jews from the former Commonwealth were allowed to reside only within the Pale, including families expelled by royal decree from St. Petersburg, Moscow and other large Russian cities. The 1821 Odessa pogroms marked the beginning of the 19th century pogroms in Tsarist Russia; there were four more such pogroms in Odessa before the end of the century. Following the assassination of Alexander II in 1881 by Narodnaya Volya, anti-Jewish events turned into a wave of over 200 pogroms by their modern definition, which lasted for several years. Jewish self-governing &quot;Kehillah&quot; were abolished by Tsar Nicholas I in 1844.

There is some disagreement about the level of planning from the Tsarist authorities and the motives for the attacks.

The first in 20th-century Russia was the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 in which 49 Jews were killed, hundreds wounded, 700 homes destroyed and 600 businesses pillaged. In the same year, pogroms took place in Gomel (Belarus), Smela, Feodosiya and Melitopol (Ukraine). Extreme savagery was typified by mutilations of the wounded. They were followed by the Zhitomir pogrom (with 29 killed), and the Kiev pogrom of October 1905 resulting in a massacre of approximately 100 Jews. In three years between 1903 and 1906, about 660 pogroms were recorded in Ukraine and Bessarabia; half a dozen more in Belorussia, carried out with the Russian government&#x27;s complicity, but no anti-Jewish pogroms were recorded in Poland. At about that time, the Jewish Labor Bund began organizing armed self-defense units ready to shoot back, and the pogroms subsided for a number of years. According to professor Colin Tatz, between 1881 and 1920 there were 1,326 pogroms in Ukraine (&quot;see: Southwestern Krai parts of the Pale&quot;) which took the lives of 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews, leaving half a million homeless. This violence across Eastern Europe prompted a wave of Jewish migration westward that totaled about 2.5 million people.

=== Eastern Europe after World War I ===

Large-scale pogroms, which began in the Russian Empire several decades earlier, intensified during the period of the Russian Civil War in the aftermath of World War I. Professor Zvi Gitelman (in &quot;A Century of Ambivalence&quot;, originally published in 1988) estimated that only in 1918–1919 over 1,200 pogroms took place in Ukraine, thus amounting to the greatest slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe since 1648. The Kiev pogroms of 1919, according to Gitelman, were the first of a subsequent wave of pogroms in which between 30,000 and 70,000 Jews were massacred across Ukraine; although more recent assessments put the Jewish death toll at more than 100,000.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his controversial 2002 book &quot;Two Hundred Years Together&quot; provided additional statistics from research conducted by Nahum Gergel (1887–1931), published in Yiddish in 1928 and English in 1951. Gergel counted 1,236 incidents of anti-Jewish violence between 1918 and 1921, and estimated that 887 mass pogroms occurred, the remainder being classified as &quot;excesses&quot; not assuming mass proportions. Of all the pogroms accounted for in Gergel&#x27;s research:
* About 40 percent were perpetrated by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic forces led by Symon Petliura. The Republic issued orders condemning pogroms, but lacked authority to intervene. After May 1919 the Directory lost its role as a credible governing body; almost 75 percent of pogroms occurred between May and September of that year. Thousands of Jews were killed only for being Jewish, without any political affiliations.
* 25 percent by the Ukrainian Green Army and various Ukrainian nationalist gangs,
* 17 percent by the White Army, especially the forces of Anton Denikin,
* 8.5 percent of Gergel&#x27;s total was attributed to pogroms carried out by men of the Red Army (more specifically Semyon Budenny&#x27;s First Cavalry, most of whose soldiers had previously served under Denikin). These pogroms were not, however, sanctioned by the Bolshevik leadership; the high command &quot;vigorously condemned these pogroms and disarmed the guilty regiments&quot;, and the pogroms would soon be condemned by Mikhail Kalinin in a speech made at a military parade in Ukraine.
Gergel&#x27;s overall figures, which are generally considered conservative, are based on the testimony of witnesses and newspaper reports collected by the &quot;Mizrakh-Yidish Historiche Arkhiv&quot; which was first based in Kiev, then Berlin and later New York. The English version of Gergel&#x27;s article was published in 1951 in the YIVO &quot;Annual of Jewish Social Science&quot; titled &quot;The Pogroms in the Ukraine in 1918–1921&quot;.

On 8 August 1919, during the Polish–Soviet War, Polish troops took over Minsk in Operation Minsk. They killed 31 Jews suspected of supporting the Bolshevist movement, beat and attacked many more, looted 377 Jewish-owned shops (aided by the local civilians) and ransacked many private homes. The &quot;Morgenthau&#x27;s report of October 1919 stated that there is no question that some of the Jewish leaders exaggerated these evils.&quot; According to Elissa Bemporad, the &quot;violence endured by the Jewish population under the Poles encouraged popular support for the Red Army, as Jewish public opinion welcomed the establishment of the Belorussian SSR.&quot;

After the First World War, during the localized armed conflicts of independence, 72 Jews were killed and 443 injured in the 1918 Lwów pogrom. The following year, pogroms were reported by the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; in several cities in the newly established Second Polish Republic.

=== Pogroms in Europe and the Americas before World War II ===

==== Argentina 1919 ====

In 1919, a pogrom occurred in Argentina, during the Tragic Week. It had an added element, as it was called to attack Jews and Catalans indiscriminately. The reasons are not clear, especially considering that, in the case of Buenos Aires, the Catalan colony, established mainly in the neighborhood of Montserrat, came from the foundation of the city, but could have been the result of the influence of Spanish nationalism, which at the time described Catalans as a Semitic ethnicity.

==== Britain and Ireland ====
In the early 20th century, pogroms broke out elsewhere in the world as well. In 1904 in Ireland, the Limerick boycott caused several Jewish families to leave the town. During the 1911 Tredegar riot in Wales, Jewish homes and businesses were looted and burned over a period of a week, before the British Army was called in by the then Home Secretary Winston Churchill, who described the riot as a &quot;pogrom&quot;.

In the north of Ireland during the early 1920s, violent riots which were aimed at the expulsion of a religious group took place. In 1920, Lisburn and Belfast saw violence related to the Irish War of Independence and partition of Ireland. On 21 July 1920 in Belfast, Protestant Loyalists marched on the Harland and Wolff shipyards and forced over 11,000 Catholic and left-wing Protestant workers from their jobs. The sectarian rioting that followed resulted in about 20 deaths in just three days. These sectarian actions are often referred to as the Belfast Pogrom. In Lisburn, County Antrim, on 23–25 August 1920 Protestant loyalist crowds looted and burned practically every Catholic business in the town and attacked Catholic homes. About 1,000 people, a third of the town&#x27;s Catholics, fled Lisburn. By the end of the first six months of 1922, hundreds of people had been killed in sectarian violence in newly formed Northern Ireland. On a per capita basis, four Roman Catholics were killed for every Protestant.

In the worst incident of anti-Jewish violence in Britain during the interwar period, the &quot;Pogrom of Mile End&quot;, that occurred in 1936, 200 Blackshirt youths ran amok in Stepney in the East End of London, smashing the windows of Jewish shops and homes and throwing an elderly man and young girl through a window. Though less serious, attacks on Jews were also reported in Manchester and Leeds in the north of England.

=== Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe ===

The first pogrom in Nazi Germany was the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, often called , in which at least 91 Jews were killed, a further 30,000 arrested and incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps, over 1,000 synagogues burned, and over 7,000 Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged.

During World War II, Nazi German death squads encouraged local populations in German-occupied Europe to commit pogroms against Jews. Brand new battalions of &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; (trained by SD agents) were mobilized from among the German minorities.

A large number of pogroms occurred during the Holocaust at the hands of non-Germans. Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the Iași pogrom in Romania, perpetrated by Ion Antonescu, in which as many as 13,266 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police and military officials.

On 1–2 June 1941, in the two-day Farhud pogrom in Iraq, perpetrated by Rashid Ali, Yunis al-Sabawi, and the al-Futuwa youth, &quot;rioters murdered between 150 and 180 Jews, injured 600 others, and raped an undetermined number of women. They also looted some 1,500 stores and homes&quot;. Also, 300–400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence.

In June–July 1941, encouraged by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in the city of Lviv the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Militia perpetrated two citywide pogroms in which around 6,000 Polish Jews were murdered, in retribution for alleged collaboration with the Soviet NKVD. In Lithuania, some local police led by Algirdas Klimaitis and Lithuanian partisansconsisting of LAF units reinforced by 3,600 deserters from the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Corps of the Red Army promulgated anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas along with occupying Nazis. On 25–26 June 1941, about 3,800 Jews were killed and synagogues and Jewish settlements burned.

During the Jedwabne pogrom of July 1941, ethnic Poles burned at least 340 Jews in a barn (Institute of National Remembrance) in the presence of Nazi German &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;. The role of the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; remains the subject of debate.

==== Europe after World War II ====
After the end of World War II, a series of violent antisemitic incidents occurred against returning Jews throughout Europe, particularly in the Soviet-occupied East where Nazi propagandists had extensively promoted the notion of a Jewish-Communist conspiracy (see Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946 and Anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944–1946). Anti-Jewish riots also took place in Britain in 1947.

== Pogroms in Asia and North Africa ==

=== 1834 pogroms in Ottoman Syria ===
There were two pogroms in Ottoman Syria in 1834.

=== 1929 in Mandatory Palestine ===
In Mandatory Palestine under British administration, Jews were targeted by Arabs in the 1929 Hebron massacre during the 1929 Palestine riots. They followed other violent incidents such as the 1920 Nebi Musa riots.

=== Thrace pogroms in Turkey in 1934 ===

=== Constantine Pogrom in French Algeria in 1934 ===

=== British North Africa in 1945 ===
Anti-Jewish rioters killed over 140 Jews in the 1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania. The 1945 Anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania was the most violent rioting against Jews in North Africa in modern times. From 5 November to 7 November 1945, more than 140 Jews were killed and many more injured in a pogrom in British-military-controlled Tripolitania. 38 Jews were killed in Tripoli from where the riots spread. 40 were killed in Amrus, 34 in Zanzur, 7 in Tajura, 13 in Zawia and 3 in Qusabat.

=== In Syria in 1947 and Morocco 1948 ===
Following the start of the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, a number of anti-Jewish events occurred throughout the Arab world, some of which have been described as pogroms. In 1947, half of Aleppo&#x27;s 10,000 Jews left the city in the wake of the Aleppo riots, while other anti-Jewish riots took place in British Aden and then in 1948 in the French Moroccan cities of Oujda and Jerada.

=== Pogroms against Alevis in Turkey (1978 and 1980) ===

=== Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982 ===

The Sabra and Shatila massacre is occasionally referred to as a pogrom.

=== 1984 anti-Sikh riots ===
Sikhs were targeted in Delhi and other parts of India during a pogrom in October 1984.

== Pogroms and race riots in the 21st century ==


=== 2002 Gujarat pogrom ===
The 2002 Gujarat riots, also known as the Gujarat pogrom, were a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the Indian state of Gujarat.

The violence was connected to the Ayodhya dispute and the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The burning of a train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims and karsevaks returning from Ayodhya, is cited as having instigated the violence.

Following the initial riot incidents, there were further outbreaks of violence in Ahmedabad for three months; statewide, there were further outbreaks of violence against the minority Muslim population of Gujarat for the next year.

=== 2005 Cronulla riots ===
The 2005 Cronulla riots (also known as the &quot;Cronulla Race Riots&quot; or the &quot;Cronulla pogrom&quot;) were a series of race riots in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

=== Attacks in the occupied West Bank in 2008 ===
In 2008, two attacks in the Occupied West Bank by Jewish Israeli settlers on Palestinian Arabs were labeled as pogroms by then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

=== 2017 anti-Rohingya pogroms ===
The 2017 Rohingya genocide, was a series of pogroms and other violence committed against the Rohingya minority of Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine State. Facebook was accused of inciting mob violence via social media.

=== West Bank settler pogroms in the early 2020s ===
There were many attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank leading up to and during the full scale war in the Gaza Strip in 2023 and 2024.

=== The Huwara rampage in February 2023 ===

Israel&#x27;s military was accused of &#x27;deliberately turning blind eye&#x27; to violent riots and legal experts said the state could face war crime charges. The rioters killed one Palestinian, 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash, and wounded dozens, while torching houses and cars.

Top Israeli general in the West Bank, Yehuda Fuchs, referred to the Israeli settlers&#x27; actions as a &quot;pogrom&quot;: &quot;The incident in Hawara was a pogrom carried out by outlaws&quot;.

Jewish American documentary maker Simone Zimmerman also used the term &quot;pogrom&quot; to describe the attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers in Hawara in February 2023. Zimmerman described these attacks as being committed by settlers while the Israeli army stood by and let it happen.

=== Hamas-initiated attacks on 7 October 2023 ===
On 7 October 2023, Hamas&#x27; Al Qassam Brigades militant wing (based in the Gaza Strip), and other groups and individuals incited to join them, initiated an attack on Israel. In addition to the military, the attack also targeted civilian communities and resulted in the deaths of over 695 Israeli civilians, most of whom were Israeli Jews and some of whom were Arab Israelis. In the attacks Al Qassam and other armed groups from Gaza also took approximately 250 people, many of which were non-Israelis hostage, including infants, elderly, and people who had already been severely injured.

The 7 October attacks were described as a &quot;pogrom&quot; by Suzanne Rutland, who defined a pogrom as a government-approved attack on Jews and pointed out that the attacks were initiated by the Hamas, the governing authority of Gaza. Others who have described the 7 October attacks as a pogrom include then-UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron, and think tanks such as the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. An editorial in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; referred to 7 October attacks as a pogrom as well, while rejecting that label for the Huwara rampage in that same year.

Survivors of October 7 have also described the attack on their kibbutzim as pogroms.

Some sources from in Israel and in the Jewish diaspora have specifically objected to the characterisation of 7 October as a pogrom, saying the events on 7 October do not resemble the original historical pogroms in Russia. &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; described the 7 October attacks as &quot;historically unique&quot;, as well as &quot;foreseeable&quot; and &quot;expected&quot;. Judith Butler, controversially described the attacks as an &quot;act of armed resistance&quot;.

=== West Bank pogroms in 2023 ===
Khirbet Zanuta is a Palestinian Bedouin village in the Hebron Governorate in the southern West Bank, south of Hebron, which was ethnically cleansed during the Israel–Hamas war. Some farmers remained or returned and the attacks continued. The location has previously been attacked in 2022.

In the Palestinian village of Al-Qanoub Israeli settlers descended from the nearby settlement of Asfar and the adjacent outpost of Pnei Kedem, burned houses, set their dogs on the farm animals, and, at gunpoint, ordered the residents to leave or else they would be killed.

=== 2024 riots against Syrian refugees in Turkey ===
In 2024 there were pogroms against Syrian refugees in Turkey.

===November 2024 Amsterdam riots===
The November 2024 Amsterdam riots preceding and following the AFC Ajax - Maccabi Tel Aviv football match were described by some as a &quot;pogrom&quot;. Israeli diplomat Danny Danon stated that, &quot;We are receiving very disturbing reports of extreme violence against Israelis and Jews on the streets of Holland. There is a pogrom currently taking place in Europe in 2024&quot;. The Mayor of Amsterdam later said that the word &quot;pogrom&quot; was inappropriate and that it had been misused as &quot;propaganda&quot;. In the weeks after the event, the initial media coverage was widely criticized for misrepresenting the event. Targets of the violence included Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, an Arab taxi driver, and pro-Palestinian protestors. In the run-up to the match, some Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were filmed pulling Palestinian flags from houses, making anti-Arab chants such as &quot;Death to Arabs&quot;, assaulting people, and vandalising local property. Calls to target Israeli supporters were subsequently shared via social media.

<text>Ardashir III (; 62127 April 630) was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 6 September 628 to 27 April 630.

== Name ==
&quot;Ardashir&quot; is the Middle Persian form of the Old Persian &quot;Ṛtaxšira&quot; (also spelled &quot;Artaxšaçā&quot;, meaning &quot;whose reign is through truth&quot;). The Latin variant of the name is &quot;&quot;. Three kings of the Achaemenid Empire were known to have the same name. He is also recorded in Greek as &quot;Adeser&quot; (; Theophanes the Confessor) and &quot;Artaxes&quot; (; &quot;Chronographeion Syntomon&quot;)

== Background ==
Ardashir was the son of king Kavad II (r. 628) and Anzoy, who was a princess from the Byzantine Empire, which made Ardashir less popular among the Iranians, who had recently been in a long and devastating war against the Byzantines. In 628, a devastating plague spread through western Iran, which claimed the lives of half of the population, including Kavad II himself.

== Reign ==
After the death of Kavad II, the &quot;Wuzurgan&quot; elected Ardashir as his successor, who was only a 7-year-old boy. In reality, however, he exercised little power and his empire was controlled by his vizier Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, whose duty was to protect the empire until Ardashir became old enough to rule. The Iranian historian al-Tabari says the following thing about Mah-Adhur Gushnasp&#x27;s administration of the Empire; &quot;Mah-Adhur Gushnasp carried on the administration of the kingdom in [such] an excellent fashion, [and with such] firm conduct, [that] no one would have been aware of Ardashir III&#x27;s youthfulness.&quot;

During the same period, a brother of Mah-Adhur Gushnasp named Narsi, was granted with Kashkar as a part of his domains, However, even under a strong vizier, things were still looking grim in Iran; Factionalism had greatly increased among the Iranians, and several powerful factions which had emerged during the reign of Ardashir&#x27;s grandfather Khosrau II, had gained firm control of important parts of Iran, while the Sasanian state was less-centralized than it had been under Ardashir&#x27;s predecessors. Ardashir&#x27;s ascension was supported by both the &quot;Pahlav&quot; (Parthian) and &quot;Parsig&quot; (Persian) faction, and a third major faction named the &quot;Nimruzi&quot;. However, sometime in 629, the &quot;Nimruzi&quot; withdrew their support for the shah, and started to conspire with the distinguished Iranian general Shahrbaraz to overthrow him. The &quot;Pahlav&quot;, under their leader Farrukh Hormizd of the Ispahbudhan clan, responded by supporting Ardashir&#x27;s aunt Boran as the new ruler of Iran, who subsequently started minting coins in the &quot;Pahlav&quot; areas of Amol, Nishapur, Gurgan and Ray.

One year later, Shahrbaraz with a force of 6,000 men marched towards Ctesiphon and besieged the city. Shahrbaraz, however, was unable to capture the city, and then made an alliance with Piruz Khosrow, the leader of the &quot;Parsig&quot;, and the previous minister of the Empire during the reign of Ardashir&#x27;s father. With the support of both the &quot;Parsig&quot; and &quot;Nimruzi&quot;, Shahrbaraz captured Ctesiphon and executed Ardashir, Mah-Adhur Gushnasp himself, and many other prominent nobles. Shahrbaraz then ascended the Iranian throne. According to late folklore, Ardashir was buried at an unknown place in Meshan.

== Coinage ==
Like his father, Ardashir III refrained from using the title of (&quot;King of Kings&quot;) on his coin engravings. This was probably done in order distance themselves from Khosrow II, who had restored the title.

<text>Ardashir II (), was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 379 to 383. He was the brother of his predecessor, Shapur II (), under whom he had served as vassal king of Adiabene, where he fought alongside his brother against the Romans. Ardashir II was appointed as his brother&#x27;s successor to rule interimly till the latter&#x27;s son Shapur III reached adulthood. Ardashir II&#x27;s short reign was largely uneventful, with the Sasanians unsuccessfully trying to maintain rule over Armenia.

Ardashir II was seemingly a strong-willed character, and is known in some sources by the epithet of &quot;nihoukar&quot; (&quot;the beneficent&quot;).

==Name==
&quot;Ardashir&quot; is the Middle Persian form of the Old Persian &quot;Ṛtaxšira&quot; (also spelled &quot;Artaxšaçā&quot;, meaning &quot;whose reign is through truth&quot;). The Latin variant of the name is &quot;&quot;. Three kings of the Achaemenid Empire were known to have the same name.

==Background==
Ardashir was the son of shah Hormizd II (), who was killed by the Iranian nobility whilst hunting. He was succeeded by Adur Narseh, who, after a brief reign which only lasted a few months, was also killed by the nobles, who then proceeded to blind the second, and imprison the third (Hormizd, who later managed to escape to the Roman Empire). Ardashir&#x27;s infant half-brother Shapur II, who was only slightly older than him, was crowned as king by the nobles so that they could gain greater control of the empire, which they were able to do until Shapur II reached his majority at the age of 16.

Ardashir, before becoming king of the Sasanian Empire, was vassal king of Adiabene from 344 to 376. It is believed that during his tenure he took part in the defense of the Sasanian Empire with Shapur when it was invaded by the Roman Emperor Julian (). Ardashir is the last figure to be recorded as king of Adiabene, which implies that the kingdom was after his tenure transformed into a province (&quot;shahr&quot;), governed by a non-royal delegate (&quot;marzban&quot; or &quot;shahrab&quot;) of the Sasanian shah. In 379, Shapur II designated Ardashir as his successor, and made him vow to abdicate when Shapur&#x27;s son, Shapur III reached adulthood. This led to some Armenian writers to wrongly state that Ardashir was Shapur&#x27;s son.

==Reign==

Armenia had been constantly the source of war between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. In 378/9, Shapur II had achieved Iranian hegemony over the country after its regent Manuel Mamikonian submitted to him. A force 10,000 of Iranian soldiers led by general Surena were dispatched to Armenia. Surena was given the title of &quot;marzban&quot; (margrave), which indicates that Armenia was now a Sasanian province. But this did not work for long. During the early reign of Ardashir II, a nobleman named Meruzhan Artsruni deliberately gave Manuel wrong information, informing him that commandant of the Iranian garrison desired to capture him. Enraged, Manuel fell upon the ten thousand Iranian soldiers stationed in Armenia and murdered them.

Ardashir responded by sending an army into Armenia, but Manuel defeated the invaders and killed their commander, Gumand Shapuh. A second Iranian force, led by Varaz, met the same fate as its predecessor. A third army, led by general Mrkhan, captured some Armenian territory before it too was massacred by Manuel and his forces. This new victory guaranteed Armenia seven years of peace. Ardashir was soon deposed or killed by the nobility, due to his continuation of Shapur II&#x27;s policy of restricting the authority of power-hungry nobles. He was succeeded by Shapur III.

Ardashir II was seemingly a strong-willed character, and is known in some sources by the epithet of &quot;nihoukar&quot; (&quot;the beneficent&quot;).

== Coins ==

The coins minted under Ardashir imitates him wearing the same dome-shaped crown worn by the first Sasanian shah, Ardashir I (). The reverse shows the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants, but in some cases also shows the shah&#x27;s head appearing from the fire, which may symbolize the royal xwarra (&quot;glory&quot;). The inscription of his coins are usually &quot;Ardashir, king of kings of the Iranians&quot; whilst rare instances of &quot;and of non-Iranians&quot; also being part of the inscription.

== Rock relief ==

Ardashir, like his forefathers, also had himself memorialized on reliefs. However, instead of using the sites of Pars (present-day Fars province) as a place for his relief, he instead had a relief carved in Taq-e Bostan in the province of Media (near present-day Kermanshah). The relief shows three standing figures wearing regalia; Ardashir being in the middle, flanked by two male figures. The figure to the right, who is giving the diadem to Ardashir originally used to recognized as the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda, but is now agreed to be Shapur II due to the style of his crown, and which also fits well due to Shapur being the one designating Ardashir as shah to begin with.

The two shahs are standing on the body of a fallen enemy, unmistakably a Roman, whose crown indicates that he is an emperor. The fallen figure is most likely supposed to represent the Roman emperor Julian, who invaded Iran in 363 and was killed west of the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. The figure standing to the far left, perceived by some to be the Zoroastrian prophet Zoroaster, is most likely the angelic divinity Mithra. He is wearing a crown embellished with twelve rays of the sun, whilst holding a raised barsom, thus sanctifying the investiture.

<text>Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco (; 1477-78 or 1473-74 – 17 September 1510), known as Giorgione ( , ; ; ), was an Italian painter of the Venetian school during the High Renaissance, who died in his thirties. He is known for the elusive poetic quality of his work, though only about six surviving paintings are firmly attributed to him. The uncertainty surrounding the identity and meaning of his work has made Giorgione one of the most mysterious figures in European art.

Together with his younger contemporary Titian, he founded the Venetian school of Italian Renaissance painting, characterised by its use of colour and mood. The school is traditionally contrasted with Florentine painting, which relied on a more linear disegno-led style.

== Life ==
What little is known of Giorgione&#x27;s life is given in Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;. He came from the small town of Castelfranco Veneto, 40 km inland from Venice. His name sometimes appears as &quot;Zorzo&quot;; the variant &quot;Giorgione&quot; (or &quot;Zorzon&quot;) may be translated &quot;Big George&quot;. It is unclear how early in boyhood he went to Venice, but stylistic evidence supports the statement of Carlo Ridolfi that he served his apprenticeship there under Giovanni Bellini; there he settled and rose to prominence as a master.

Contemporary documents record that his talent was recognized early. In 1500, when he was in his twenties, he was chosen to paint portraits of the Doge Agostino Barbarigo and the condottiere Consalvo Ferrante. In 1504, he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece in memory of another condottiere, Matteo Costanzo, in the cathedral of his native town, Castelfranco. In 1507, he received, at the order of the Council of Ten, partial payment for a picture (subject unknown) in which he was engaged for the Hall of the Audience in the Doge&#x27;s Palace. From 1507 to 1508 he was employed, with other artists of his generation, to decorate with frescoes the exterior of the newly rebuilt Fondaco dei Tedeschi (or German Merchants&#x27; Hall) at Venice, having already done similar work on the exterior of the Casa Soranzo, the Casa Grimani alli Servi and other Venetian palaces. Very little of this work now survives.
Vasari mentions his meeting with Leonardo da Vinci on the occasion of the Tuscan master&#x27;s visit to Venice in 1500. All accounts agree in representing Giorgione as a person of distinguished and romantic charm, a great lover and a musician, given to express in his art the sensuous and imaginative grace, touched with poetic melancholy, of Venetian life of his time. They represent him further as having made in Venetian painting an advance analogous to that made in Tuscan painting by Leonardo more than twenty years before.

He was very closely associated with Titian; although Vasari says that Titian was Giorgione&#x27;s disciple, Ridolfi says that they both were pupils of Giovanni Bellini and lived together in his home. They worked together on the Fondaco dei Tedeschi frescoes, and Titian finished at least some paintings of Giorgione after his death, although which ones remains controversial.

Giorgione also introduced a new range of subjects. Besides altarpieces and portraits he painted pictures that told no story, whether biblical or classical, or if they professed to tell a story, neglected the action and simply embodied in form and color moods of lyrical or romantic feeling, much as a musician might embody them in sounds. Innovating with the courage and felicity of genius, he had for a time an overwhelming influence on his contemporaries and immediate successors in the Venetian school, including Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo, Palma il Vecchio, il Cariani, Giulio Campagnola (and his brother), and even on his already eminent master, Giovanni Bellini. In the Venetian mainland, &quot;Giorgionismo&quot; strongly influenced Morto da Feltre, Domenico Capriolo, and Domenico Mancini.

Giorgione died of the plague then raging, on the 17th of September, 1510. He was usually thought to have died and been buried on the island of Poveglia in the Venetian lagoon, but an archival document published for the first time in 2011 places his death on the island of Lazzareto Nuovo; both were used as places of quarantine in times of plague. October 1510 is also the date of a letter by Isabella d&#x27;Este to a Venetian friend; asking him to buy a painting by Giorgione; the letter shows she was aware he was already dead. Significantly, the reply a month later said the painting was not to be had at any price.

His name and work continue to exercise a spell on posterity. But to identify and define, among the relics of his age and school, precisely what that work is, and to distinguish it from the similar work of other men whom his influence inspired, is a very difficult matter. Although there are no longer any supporters of the &quot;Pan Giorgionismus&quot; which a century ago claimed for Giorgione nearly every painting of the time that at all resembles his manner, there are still, as then, exclusive critics who reduce to half a dozen the list of extant pictures that they will admit to be by this painter.

== Works ==

For his home town of Castelfranco, Giorgione painted the &quot;Castelfranco Madonna&quot;, an altarpiece in sacra conversazione form—Madonna enthroned, with saints on either side forming an equilateral triangle. This gave the landscape background an importance which marks an innovation in Venetian art, and was quickly followed by his master Giovanni Bellini and others. Giorgione began to use the very refined chiaroscuro called sfumato—the delicate use of shades of color to depict light and perspective—around the same time as Leonardo. Whether Vasari is correct in saying he learned it from Leonardo&#x27;s works is unclear—he is always keen to ascribe all advances to Florentine sources. Leonardo&#x27;s delicate color modulations result from the tiny disconnected spots of paint that he probably derived from Illuminated manuscript techniques and first brought into oil painting. These gave Giorgione&#x27;s works the magical glow of light for which they are celebrated.

Most central and typical of all of Giorgione&#x27;s extant works is the &quot;Sleeping Venus&quot; now in Dresden. It was first recognized by Giovanni Morelli, and is now universally accepted, as being the same as the picture seen by Marcantonio Michiel and later by Ridolfi (his 17th-century biographer) in the Casa Marcello at Venice. An exquisitely pure and severe rhythm of line and contour chastens the sensuous richness of the painting. The sweep of white drapery on which the goddess lies; and the glowing landscape that fills the space behind her; most harmoniously frame her divinity. The use of an external landscape to frame a nude is innovative; but in addition, to add to her mystery, she is shrouded in sleep, spirited away from accessibility to any conscious expression.

It is recorded by Michiel that Giorgione left this piece unfinished and that the landscape, with a Cupid which subsequent restoration has removed, were completed after his death by Titian. The picture is the prototype of Titian&#x27;s own &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; and of many more by other painters of the school; but none of them attained the fame of the first exemplar. The same concept of idealized beauty is evoked in a virginally pensive &quot;Judith&quot; from the Hermitage Museum, a large painting which exhibits Giorgione&#x27;s special qualities of color richness and landscape romance, while demonstrating that life and death are each other&#x27;s companions rather than foes.

Apart from the altarpiece and the frescoes, all Giorgione&#x27;s surviving works are small paintings designed for the wealthy Venetian collector to keep in his home; most are under two feet (60 cm) in either dimension. This market had been emerging over the last half of the 15th century in Italy, and was much better established in the Netherlands, but Giorgione was the first major Italian painter to concentrate his work on it to such an extent—indeed soon after his death the size of paintings began to increase with the prosperity and palaces of the patrons.
&quot;The Tempest&quot; has been called the first landscape in the history of Western painting. The subject of this painting is unclear, but its artistic mastery is apparent. &quot;The Tempest&quot; portrays a man and a breast-feeding woman on either side of a stream, amid a city&#x27;s rubble and an incoming storm. The multitude of symbols in &quot;The Tempest&quot; offer many interpretations, but none is wholly satisfying. Theories that the painting is about duality (city and country, male and female) have been dismissed since radiography has shown that in the earlier stages of the painting the man to the left was a seated female nude.

&quot;The Three Philosophers&quot; is equally enigmatic and its attribution to Giorgione is still disputed. The three figures stand near a dark empty cave. Sometimes interpreted as symbols of Plato&#x27;s cave or the Three Magi, they seem lost in a typical Giorgionesque dreamy mood, reinforced by a hazy light characteristic of his other landscapes, such as the &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot;, now in the Louvre. The latter &quot;reveals the Venetians&#x27; love of textures&quot;, because the painter &quot;renders almost palpable the appearance of flesh, fabric, wood, stone, and foliage&quot;. The painting is devoid of harsh contours and its treatment of landscape has been frequently compared to pastoral poetry, hence the title.

Giorgione and the young Titian revolutionized the genre of the portrait as well. It is exceedingly difficult and sometimes simply impossible to differentiate Titian&#x27;s early works from those of Giorgione. None of Giorgione&#x27;s paintings are signed and only one bears a reliable date: his portrait of &quot;Laura&quot; (1 June 1506), one of the first to be painted in the &quot;modern manner&quot;, distinguished by dignity, clarity, and sophisticated characterization. Even more striking is the &quot;Portrait of a Young Man&quot; now in Berlin, acclaimed by art historians for &quot;the indescribably subtle expression of serenity and the immobile features, added to the chiseled effect of the silhouette and modeling&quot;.

Few of the portraits attributed to Giorgione appear as straightforward records of the appearance of a commissioning individual, although it is entirely possible that many are. Many can be read as types designed to express a mood or atmosphere, and certainly many of the examples of the portrait tradition Giorgione initiated appear to have had this purpose, and not to have been sold to the sitter. The subjects of his non-religious figure paintings are equally hard to discern. Perhaps the first question to ask is whether there was intended to be a specific meaning to these paintings that ingenious research can hope to recover. Many art historians argue that there is not: &quot;The best evidence, perhaps, that Giorgione&#x27;s pictures were not particularly esoteric in their meaning is provided by the fact that while his stylistic innovations were widely adopted, the distinguishing feature of virtually all Venetian non-religious painting in the first half of the 16th century is the lack of learned or literary content&quot;.

== Attributions ==

Attributions of work by Giorgione&#x27;s hand dates from soon after his death, when some of his paintings were completed by other artists, and his considerable reputation also led to very early erroneous claims of attribution. The vast bulk of documentation for paintings in this period relates to large commissions for Church or government; the small domestic panels that make up the bulk of Giorgione&#x27;s oeuvre are always far less likely to be recorded. Other artists continued to work in his style for some years, and probably by the mid-century deliberately deceptive work had started.

Primary documentation for attributions comes from the Venetian collector Marcantonio Michiel. In notes dating from 1525 to 1543 he identifies twelve paintings and one drawing as by Giorgione, of which five of the paintings are identified virtually unanimously with surviving works by art historians: &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;The Three Philosophers&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Venus&quot;, &quot;Boy with an Arrow&quot;, and &quot;Shepherd with a Flute&quot; (not all accept the last as by Giorgione however). Michiel describes the &quot;Philosophers&quot; as having been completed by Sebastiano del Piombo, and the &quot;Venus&quot; as finished by Titian (it is now generally agreed that Titian did the landscape). Some recent art historians also involve Titian in the &quot;Three Philosophers&quot;. The &quot;Tempest&quot; is therefore the only one of the group universally accepted as wholly by Giorgione. In addition, the &quot;Castelfranco Altarpiece&quot; in his hometown has rarely, if ever, been doubted, nor have the wrecked fresco fragments from the German warehouse. The Vienna &quot;Laura&quot; is the only work with his name and the date (1506). This is on the back and is not necessarily by his own hand, but does appear to come from the period. The early pair of paintings in the Uffizi are usually accepted.

After that, things become more complicated, as exemplified by Vasari. In the first edition of the &quot;Vite&quot; (1550), he attributed a &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot; to Giorgione; in the second edition completed in 1568 he ascribed authorship, variously, to Giorgione in his biography, which was printed in 1565, and to Titian in his, printed in 1567. He had visited Venice in between these dates, and may have obtained different information. The uncertainty in distinguishing between the painting of Giorgione and the young Titian is most apparent in the case of the Louvre&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; (or &quot;Fête champêtre&quot;), described in 2003 as &quot;perhaps the most contentious problem of attribution in the whole of Italian Renaissance art,&quot; but affects a large number of paintings possibly from Giorgione&#x27;s last years.

The &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; is one of a small group of paintings, including the &quot;Virgin and Child with Saint Anthony and Saint Roch&quot; in the Prado, which are very close in style and, according to Charles Hope, have been &quot;more and more frequently given to Titian, not so much because of any very compelling resemblance to his undisputed early works—which would surely have been noted before—as because he seemed a less implausible candidate than Giorgione. But no one has been able to create a coherent sequence of Titian&#x27;s early works that includes these ones, in a way that commands general support, and fits the known facts of his career. An alternative proposal is to assign the &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; and the other pictures like it to a third artist, the very obscure Domenico Mancini.&quot; While Crowe and Cavalcaselle considered the &quot;Concert&quot; from Palazzo Pitti as Giorgione&#x27;s masterpiece but disattributed the Louvre&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot;, Lermolieff reinstated the &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; and claimed instead that the Pitti &quot;Concert&quot; was by Titian.

Giulio Campagnola, well known as the engraver who translated the Giorgionesque style into prints, but none of whose paintings are securely identified, is also sometimes also brought into consideration. For example, the late W.R. Rearick gave him &quot;Il Tramonto&quot; (see Gallery) and he is an alternative choice for a number of drawings that might be by Titian or Giorgione, and both are sometimes credited with the design of some of his engravings.

A group of paintings from an earlier period in Giorgione&#x27;s short career is sometimes described as the &quot;Allendale group&quot;, after the &quot;Allendale Nativity&quot; (or &quot;Allendale Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, rather more correctly) in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. This group includes another Washington painting, the &quot;Holy Family&quot;, and an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; predella panel in the National Gallery, London. The paintings in this group, now often expanded to include a very similar &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; in Vienna, and sometimes other works, are increasingly included in or sometimes excluded from Giorgione&#x27;s oeuvre. Ironically, the &quot;Allendale Nativity&quot; caused the rupture in the 1930s between Lord Duveen, who sold it to Samuel Kress as a Giorgione, and his expert Bernard Berenson, who insisted it was an early Titian. Berenson had played a significant part in reducing the Giorgione catalogue, recognising fewer than twenty paintings.

Matters are further complicated because no drawing can be certainly identified as by Giorgione (although one in Rotterdam is widely accepted), and a number of aspects of the arguments over the defining of Giorgione&#x27;s late style involve drawings.

Despite being greatly praised by contemporary writers and remaining a great name in Italy, Giorgione became less known to the wider world, and many of his (probable) paintings were assigned to others. The Hermitage &quot;Judith&quot; for example, was long regarded as a Raphael, and the Dresden &quot;Venus&quot; a Titian. In the late 19th century a great Giorgione revival began, and the fashion ran the other way. Despite well over a century of dispute, controversy remains active. Large numbers of pictures attributed to Giorgione a century ago, in particular portraits, are now firmly excluded from his oeuvre, but debate is, if anything, more fierce now than then. There are effectively two fronts on which the battles are fought: paintings with figures and landscape, and portraits. According to David Rosand in 1997, &quot;The situation has been thrown into new critical confusion by Alessandro Ballarin&#x27;s radical revision of the corpus ... [Paris exhibition catalogue, 1993, increasing it] ... as well as Mauro Lucco ... [Milan book, 1996].&quot; Recent major exhibitions at Vienna and Venice in 2004 and Washington in 2006, have given art historians further opportunities to see disputed works side by side (see External links below).

But the situation remains confused; in 2012 Charles Hope complained: &quot;In fact, there are only three paintings known today for which there is clear and credible early evidence that they were by him. Despite this, he is now generally credited with between twenty and forty paintings. But most of these ... bear no resemblance to the three just mentioned. Some of them might be by Giorgione, but in most cases there is no way of telling&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Although he died in his thirties, Giorgione left a lasting legacy to be developed by Titian and 17th-century artists. Giorgione never subordinated line and colour to architecture, nor an artistic effect to a sentimental presentation. He was arguably the first Italian to paint landscapes with figures as movable pictures in their own frames with no devotional, allegorical, or historical purpose—and the first whose colours possessed that ardent, glowing, and melting intensity which was so soon to typify the work of all the Venetian School.

<text>In electrical circuits, reactance is the opposition presented to alternating current by inductance and capacitance. Along with resistance, it is one of two elements of impedance; however, while both elements involve transfer of electrical energy, no dissipation of electrical energy as heat occurs in reactance; instead, the reactance stores energy until a quarter-cycle later when the energy is returned to the circuit. Greater reactance gives smaller current for the same applied voltage.

Reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going through a circuit element. Like resistance, reactance is measured in ohms, with positive values indicating &quot;inductive&quot; reactance and negative indicating &quot;capacitive&quot; reactance. It is denoted by the symbol formula_1. An ideal resistor has zero reactance, whereas ideal reactors have no shunt conductance and no series resistance. As frequency increases, inductive reactance increases and capacitive reactance decreases.

== Comparison to resistance ==
Reactance is similar to resistance in that larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same applied voltage. Further, a circuit made entirely of elements that have only reactance (and no resistance) can be treated the same way as a circuit made entirely of resistances. These same techniques can also be used to combine elements with reactance with elements with resistance but complex numbers are typically needed. This is treated below in the section on impedance.

There are several important differences between reactance and resistance, though. First, reactance changes the phase so that the current through the element is shifted by a quarter of a cycle relative to the phase of the voltage applied across the element. Second, power is not dissipated in a purely reactive element but is stored instead. Third, reactances can be negative so that they can &#x27;cancel&#x27; each other out. Finally, the main circuit elements that have reactance (capacitors and inductors) have a frequency dependent reactance, unlike resistors which have the same resistance for all frequencies, at least in the ideal case.

The term &quot;reactance&quot; was first suggested by French engineer M. Hospitalier in &quot;L&#x27;Industrie Electrique&quot; on 10 May 1893. It was officially adopted by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in May 1894.

== Capacitive reactance ==
A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator, also known as a dielectric.

&quot;Capacitive reactance&quot; is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element. Capacitive reactance formula_2 is inversely proportional to the signal frequency formula_3 (or angular frequency formula_4) and the capacitance formula_5.

There are two choices in the literature for defining reactance for a capacitor. One is to use a uniform notion of reactance as the imaginary part of impedance, in which case the reactance of a capacitor is the negative number,

:formula_6.

Another choice is to define capacitive reactance as a positive number,

:formula_7.

In this case however one needs to remember to add a negative sign for the impedance of a capacitor, i.e. formula_8.

At formula_9, the magnitude of the capacitor&#x27;s reactance is infinite, behaving like an (preventing any current from flowing through the dielectric). As frequency increases, the magnitude of reactance decreases, allowing more current to flow. As formula_3 approaches formula_11, the capacitor&#x27;s reactance approaches formula_12, behaving like a short circuit.

The application of a DC voltage across a capacitor causes positive charge to accumulate on one side and negative charge to accumulate on the other side; the electric field due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the potential associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.

Driven by an AC supply (ideal AC current source), a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes polarity and the charge is returned to the source. The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.

== Inductive reactance ==
Inductive reactance is a property exhibited by an inductor, and inductive reactance exists based on the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it. In the context of an AC circuit (although this concept applies any time current is changing), this magnetic field is constantly changing as a result of current that oscillates back and forth. It is this change in magnetic field that induces another electric current to flow in the same wire (counter-EMF), in a direction such as to oppose the flow of the current originally responsible for producing the magnetic field (known as Lenz&#x27;s law). Hence, &quot;inductive reactance&quot; is an opposition to the change of current through an element.

For an ideal inductor in an AC circuit, the inhibitive effect on change in current flow results in a delay, or a phase shift, of the alternating current with respect to alternating voltage. Specifically, an ideal inductor (with no resistance) will cause the current to lag the voltage by a quarter cycle, or 90°.

In electric power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because power is not completely transferred when voltage and current are out-of-phase (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an out-of-phase system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, because there will be points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is &quot;negative&quot;. However, current still flows even when a system is out-of-phase, which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up so much (or else they would physically sag too much, due to the heat expanding the metal transmission lines), so transmission line operators have a &quot;ceiling&quot; on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line. Power providers utilize capacitors to shift the phase and minimize the losses, based on usage patterns.

Inductive reactance formula_13 is proportional to the sinusoidal signal frequency formula_3 and the inductance formula_15, which depends on the physical shape of the inductor:

formula_16.

The average current flowing through an inductance formula_15 in series with a sinusoidal AC voltage source of RMS amplitude formula_18 and frequency formula_3 is equal to:
:formula_20

Because a square wave has multiple amplitudes at sinusoidal harmonics, the average current flowing through an inductance formula_15 in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS amplitude formula_18 and frequency formula_3 is equal to:
:formula_24
making it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was about 19% smaller formula_25 than the reactance to the AC sine wave.

Any conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an electromagnetic coil. Faraday&#x27;s law of electromagnetic induction gives the counter-emf formula_26 (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of magnetic flux density formula_27 through a current loop.

:formula_28.
:formula_29
where:
*formula_30 is the complex impedance, measured in ohms;
*formula_31 is the resistance, measured in ohms. It is the real part of the impedance: formula_32
*formula_1 is the reactance, measured in ohms. It is the imaginary part of the impedance: formula_34
*formula_35 is the square root of minus one, usually represented by formula_36 in non-electrical formulas. formula_35 is used so as not to confuse the imaginary unit with current, commonly represented by formula_36.

When both a capacitor and an inductor are placed in series in a circuit, their contributions to the total circuit impedance are opposite. Capacitive reactance formula_2 and inductive reactance formula_13 contribute to the total reactance formula_1 as follows:
:formula_42
where:
*formula_13 is the inductive reactance, measured in ohms;
*formula_2 is the capacitive reactance, measured in ohms;
*formula_4 is the angular frequency, formula_46 times the frequency in Hz.

Hence:
*if formula_47, the total reactance is said to be inductive;
*if formula_48, then the impedance is purely resistive;
*if formula_49, the total reactance is said to be capacitive.

Note however that if formula_13 and formula_2 are assumed both positive by definition, then the intermediary formula changes to a difference:

:formula_52

but the ultimate value is the same.

=== Phase relationship ===

The phase of the voltage across a purely reactive device (i.e. with zero parasitic resistance) &quot;lags&quot; the current by formula_53 radians for a capacitive reactance and &quot;leads&quot; the current by formula_53 radians for an inductive reactance. Without knowledge of both the resistance and reactance the relationship between voltage and current cannot be determined.

The origin of the different signs for capacitive and inductive reactance is the phase factor formula_55 in the impedance.

:formula_56

For a reactive component the sinusoidal voltage across the component is in quadrature (a formula_53 phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power.

<text>Capacitance is the ability of an object to store electric charge. It is measured by the change in charge in response to a difference in electric potential, expressed as the ratio of those quantities. Commonly recognized are two closely related notions of capacitance: &quot;self capacitance&quot; and &quot;mutual capacitance&quot;. An object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance, for which the electric potential is measured between the object and ground. Mutual capacitance is measured between two components, and is particularly important in the operation of the capacitor, an elementary linear electronic component designed to add capacitance to an electric circuit.

The capacitance between two conductors depends only on the geometry; the opposing surface area of the conductors and the distance between them; and the permittivity of any dielectric material between them. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity, and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.

The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (symbol: F), named after the English physicist Michael Faraday. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates. The reciprocal of capacitance is called elastance.

==Self capacitance==
In discussing electrical circuits, the term &quot;capacitance&quot; is usually a shorthand for the mutual capacitance between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, every isolated conductor also exhibits capacitance, here called &quot;self capacitance&quot;. It is measured by the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its electric potential by one unit of measurement, e.g., one volt. The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, with the conductor centered inside this sphere.

Self capacitance of a conductor is defined by the ratio of charge and electric potential:
formula_1
where
*formula_2 is the charge held,
*formula_3 is the electric potential,
*formula_4 is the surface charge density,
*formula_5 is an infinitesimal element of area on the surface of the conductor, over which the surface charge density is integrated,
*formula_6 is the length from formula_5 to a fixed point &quot;M&quot; on the conductor,
*formula_8 is the vacuum permittivity.

Using this method, the self capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius formula_9 in free space (i.e. far away from any other charge distributions) is:
formula_10

Example values of self capacitance are:
*for the top &quot;plate&quot; of a van de Graaff generator, typically a sphere 20 cm in radius: 22.24 pF,
*the planet Earth: about 710 μF.

The inter-winding capacitance of a coil is sometimes called self capacitance, but this is a different phenomenon. It is actually mutual capacitance between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray or parasitic capacitance. This self capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies: it changes the impedance of the coil and gives rise to parallel resonance. In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.

==Mutual capacitance==
A common form is a parallel-plate capacitor, which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a dielectric material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is very nearly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.

If the charges on the plates are formula_11 and formula_12, and formula_13 gives the voltage between the plates, then the capacitance formula_14 is given by formula_1
which gives the voltage/current relationship
formula_16
where formula_17 is the instantaneous rate of change of voltage, and formula_18 is the instantaneous rate of change of the capacitance. For most applications, the change in capacitance over time is negligible, so the formula reduces to:
formula_19

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by integrating the work formula_20:
formula_21

===Capacitance matrix===
The discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape. The definition formula_22 does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, James Clerk Maxwell introduced his &quot;coefficients of potential&quot;. If three (nearly ideal) conductors are given charges formula_23, then the voltage at conductor 1 is given by
formula_24
and similarly for the other voltages. Hermann von Helmholtz and Sir William Thomson showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that formula_25, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the &quot;elastance matrix&quot; or &quot;reciprocal capacitance matrix&quot;, which is defined as:
formula_26

From this, the mutual capacitance formula_27 between two objects can be defined by solving for the total charge formula_28 and using formula_29.

formula_30

Since no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two &quot;plates&quot;, it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.

The collection of coefficients formula_31 is known as the &quot;capacitance matrix&quot;, and is the inverse of the elastance matrix.

==Capacitors==

The capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the farad. The most common units of capacitance are the microfarad (μF), nanofarad (nF), picofarad (pF), and, in microcircuits, femtofarad (fF). Some applications also use supercapacitors that can be much larger, as much as hundreds of farads, and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. Historical texts use other, obsolete submultiples of the farad, such as &quot;mf&quot; and &quot;mfd&quot; for microfarad (μF); &quot;mmf&quot;, &quot;mmfd&quot;, &quot;pfd&quot;, &quot;μμF&quot; for picofarad (pF).

The capacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.

An example is the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area formula_32 separated by a distance formula_33. If formula_33 is sufficiently small with respect to the smallest chord of formula_32, there holds, to a high level of accuracy:
formula_36

formula_37

where
*formula_14 is the capacitance, in farads;
*formula_32 is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;
*formula_40 is the electric constant &lt;/math&gt;);}} 
*formula_41 is the relative permittivity (also dielectric constant) of the material in between the plates for air); and
*formula_33 is the separation between the plates, in meters.

The equation is a good approximation if &quot;d&quot; is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called &quot;fringing field&quot; around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance.

Combining the equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitor, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:
formula_43
where formula_20 is the energy, in joules; formula_14 is the capacitance, in farads; and formula_13 is the voltage, in volts.

==Stray capacitance==

Any two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area. This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or stray capacitance. Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called crosstalk), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at high frequency.

Stray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for feedback, which can cause instability and parasitic oscillation in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration – including the input-to-output capacitance – is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller&#x27;s theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is , then an impedance of &quot;Z&quot; connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a impedance between the first node and ground and a impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, &quot;C&quot;, is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.

==Capacitance of conductors with simple shapes ==
Calculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the Laplace equation formula_47 with a constant potential formula_48 on the 2-dimensional surface of the conductors embedded in 3-space. This is simplified by symmetries. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.

For plane situations, analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also Schwarz–Christoffel mapping.

==Energy storage==
The energy (measured in joules) stored in a capacitor is equal to the &quot;work&quot; required to push the charges into the capacitor, i.e. to charge it. Consider a capacitor of capacitance &quot;C&quot;, holding a charge +&quot;q&quot; on one plate and −&quot;q&quot; on the other. Moving a small element of charge d&quot;q&quot; from one plate to the other against the potential difference requires the work d&quot;W&quot;:
formula_49
where &quot;W&quot; is the work measured in joules, &quot;q&quot; is the charge measured in coulombs and &quot;C&quot; is the capacitance, measured in farads.

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by integrating this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance () and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +&quot;Q&quot; and −&quot;Q&quot; requires the work &quot;W&quot;:
formula_50

==Nanoscale systems==
The capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as quantum dots may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, so the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device is exceedingly complex.

===Single-electron devices===
The capacitance of a connected, or &quot;closed&quot;, single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or &quot;open&quot;, single-electron device. This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose &quot;direct polarization&quot; interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device&#x27;s dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).

===Few-electron devices===
The derivation of a &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an &quot;N&quot;-particle system given by
formula_51

whose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The definition of capacitance,
formula_52
with the potential difference
formula_53

may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons,
formula_54 and formula_55

The &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of the device is then
formula_56

This expression of &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; may be written as
formula_57
which differs from the conventional expression described in the introduction where formula_58, the stored electrostatic potential energy,
formula_59
by a factor of with formula_60.

However, within the framework of purely classical electrostatic interactions, the appearance of the factor of is the result of integration in the conventional formulation involving the work done when charging a capacitor,
formula_61

which is appropriate since formula_62 for systems involving either many electrons or metallic electrodes, but in few-electron systems, formula_63. The integral generally becomes a summation. One may trivially combine the expressions of capacitance 
formula_64 
and electrostatic interaction energy,
formula_65
to obtain
formula_66

which is similar to the quantum capacitance. A more rigorous derivation is reported in the literature. In particular, to circumvent the mathematical challenges of spatially complex equipotential surfaces within the device, an &quot;average&quot; electrostatic potential experienced by each electron is utilized in the derivation.

Apparent mathematical differences may be understood more fundamentally. The potential energy, formula_67, of an isolated device (self-capacitance) is twice that stored in a &quot;connected&quot; device in the lower limit formula_68. As formula_69 grows large, formula_70. Thus, the general expression of capacitance is
formula_71

In nanoscale devices such as quantum dots, the &quot;capacitor&quot; is often an isolated or partially isolated component within the device. The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, that contribute to the device&#x27;s electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, nanowires consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.

==Capacitance in electronic and semiconductor devices==

In electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by a time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric fields and by a number of physical phenomena - such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, impact ionization, etc. As a result, device admittance is frequency-dependent, and a simple electrostatic formula for capacitance formula_72 is not applicable. A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is:
formula_73
where formula_74 is the device admittance, and formula_75 is the angular frequency.

In general, capacitance is a function of frequency. At high frequencies, capacitance approaches a constant value, equal to &quot;geometric&quot; capacitance, determined by the terminals&#x27; geometry and dielectric content in the device.
A paper by Steven Laux presents a review of numerical techniques for capacitance calculation. In particular, capacitance can be calculated by a Fourier transform of a transient current in response to a step-like voltage excitation:
formula_76

==Negative capacitance in semiconductor devices==

Usually, capacitance in semiconductor devices is positive. However, in some devices and under certain conditions (temperature, applied voltages, frequency, etc.), capacitance can become negative. Non-monotonic behavior of the transient current in response to a step-like excitation has been proposed as the mechanism of negative capacitance. Negative capacitance has been demonstrated and explored in many different types of semiconductor devices.

== Measuring capacitance ==

A capacitance meter is a piece of electronic test equipment used to measure capacitance, mainly of discrete capacitors. For most purposes and in most cases the capacitor must be disconnected from circuit.

Many DVMs (digital volt meters) have a capacitance-measuring function. These usually operate by charging and discharging the capacitor under test with a known current and measuring the rate of rise of the resulting voltage; the slower the rate of rise, the larger the capacitance. DVMs can usually measure capacitance from nanofarads to a few hundred microfarads, but wider ranges are not unusual. It is also possible to measure capacitance by passing a known high-frequency alternating current through the device under test and measuring the resulting voltage across it (does not work for polarised capacitors).

More sophisticated instruments use other techniques such as inserting the capacitor-under-test into a bridge circuit. By varying the values of the other legs in the bridge (so as to bring the bridge into balance), the value of the unknown capacitor is determined. This method of &quot;indirect&quot; use of measuring capacitance ensures greater precision. Through the use of Kelvin connections and other careful design techniques, these instruments can usually measure capacitors over a range from picofarads to farads.

<text>Gordian III (; 20 January 225 – February 244) was Roman emperor from 238 to 244. At the age of 13, he became the youngest sole emperor of the united Roman Empire. Gordian was the son of Maecia Faustina and Junius Balbus, who died before 238. Maecia was the daughter of Emperor Gordian I and sister of Emperor Gordian II. Very little is known of his early life before his acclamation.

==Rise to power==

In 235, following the murder of Emperor Alexander Severus in Moguntiacum (modern Mainz), the capital of the Roman province Germania Superior, Maximinus Thrax was acclaimed emperor. In the following years, there was a growing opposition against Maximinus in the Roman Senate and amongst the majority of the population of Rome. In 238, a rebellion broke out in the Africa Province, where Gordian&#x27;s grandfather and uncle, Gordian I and II, were proclaimed joint emperors. This revolt was suppressed within a month by Cappellianus, governor of Numidia and a loyal supporter of Maximinus Thrax.

The Senate, showing its hostility towards Maximinus by supporting the Gordiani, elected Pupienus and Balbinus as joint emperors. These senators were not popular men, so the Senate decided to raise Marcus Antonius Gordianus to the rank of &quot;Caesar&quot; (heir). Maximinus, moving quickly to attack the Senate&#x27;s newly elected emperors, encountered difficulties marching his army through an Alpine winter. Arriving at Aquileia and short on supplies, Maximinus besieged the city. After four weeks, Maximinus&#x27; demoralized army mutinied and the Legio II Parthica murdered him.

The situation for Pupienus and Balbinus, despite Maximinus&#x27; death, was doomed from the start with popular riots, military discontent and an enormous fire that consumed Rome. Soon after, Pupienus and Balbinus were killed by the Praetorian Guard and Gordian proclaimed sole emperor. The exact chronology of events is disputed, but it was probably around August.

==Reign==

Due to Gordian&#x27;s age, the imperial government was surrendered to the aristocratic families, who controlled the affairs of Rome through the Senate. In 240, Sabinianus revolted in the African province, but he was quickly defeated. In 241, Gordian was married to Furia Sabinia Tranquillina, daughter of the newly appointed praetorian prefect, Timesitheus. As chief of the Praetorian Guard and father in law of the Emperor, Timesitheus quickly became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Roman Empire.

During Gordian&#x27;s reign there were severe earthquakes, so severe that cities fell into the ground along with their inhabitants. In response to these earthquakes Gordian consulted the Sibylline books.

By the 3rd century, the Roman frontiers weakened against the Germanic tribes across the Rhine and Danube, and the Sassanid Empire across the Euphrates increased its own attacks. When the Sasanians under Shapur I invaded Mesopotamia, the young emperor opened the doors of the Temple of Janus for the last time in Roman history, and sent a large army to the East. The Sassanids were driven back over the Euphrates and defeated in the Battle of Resaena (243). The campaign was a success and Gordian, who had joined the army, was planning an invasion of the enemy&#x27;s territory, when his father-in-law died in unclear circumstances. Without Timesitheus, the campaign, and the Emperor&#x27;s security, were at risk. Due to the campaign&#x27;s success, Gordian boasted about his achievements to the Senate. 
Gaius Julius Priscus and, later on, his own brother Marcus Julius Philippus, also known as Philip the Arab, stepped in at this moment as the new Praetorian Prefects. Gordian would then start a second campaign. Around February 244, the Sasanians fought back fiercely to halt the Roman advance to Ctesiphon.

The exact fate of Gordian is unclear, but he was most likely killed at the Battle of Misiche. An inscription erected by Shapur claims that a battle near modern Fallujah (Iraq) resulted in a major Roman defeat and the death of Gordian III, after which Philip bought peace for 500,000 dinars. Roman sources claim that the soldiers proclaimed Philip emperor, that he made peace with Shapur on &quot;shameful&quot; terms, and that Gordian died as the Roman forces departed for the west. Zonaras says that Gordian died after falling from his horse during a battle. One view holds that Gordian died at Zaitha, murdered by his frustrated army, while the role of Philip is unknown. Scholarly analyses suggest the Sasanian version, &quot;while defective[,] is superior&quot; to the Roman one, which provides no explanation for why the victorious Roman army had to make peace on disadvantageous terms.

The deposition of Gordian&#x27;s body is also a matter of controversy. According to David S. Potter, Philip transferred the body of the deceased emperor to Rome and arranged for his deification. Edwell, Dodgeon, and Lieu state that Philip had Gordian buried at Zaitha after the campaign against the Sasanians had ended in failure.

<text>Gordian I (; 158 – April 238 AD) was Roman emperor for 22 days with his son Gordian II in 238, the Year of the Six Emperors. Caught up in a rebellion against the Emperor Maximinus Thrax, he was defeated in battle and committed suicide after the death of his son, having had the second shortest reign in imperial history.

==Family and background==
Gordian I was said to be related to prominent senators of his time. His praenomen and nomen &quot;Marcus Antonius&quot; suggested that his paternal ancestors received Roman citizenship under the triumvir Mark Antony, or one of his daughters, during the late Roman Republic. Gordian&#x27;s cognomen ‘Gordianus’ also indicates that his family origins were from Anatolia, more specifically Galatia or Cappadocia.

According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, his mother was a Roman woman called Ulpia Gordiana and his father was the senator Maecius Marullus. While modern historians have dismissed his father&#x27;s name as false, there may be some truth behind the identity of his mother. Gordian&#x27;s family history can be guessed through inscriptions. The name &quot;Sempronianus&quot; in his name, for instance, may indicate a connection to his mother or grandmother. In Ankara, Turkey, a funeral inscription has been found that names a &quot;Sempronia Romana&quot;, daughter of a named &quot;Sempronius Aquila&quot; (an imperial secretary). Romana erected this undated funeral inscription to her husband (whose name is lost), who died as a praetor-designate.

French historian Christian Settipani has conjectured that Gordian I&#x27;s parents were Marcus Antonius (b. ca 135), &quot;tr. pl.&quot;, &quot;praet. des.&quot;, and wife Sempronia Romana (b. ca 140), daughter of Titus Flavius Sempronius Aquila (b. ca 115), &quot;Secretarius ab epistulis Graecis&quot;, and wife Claudia (b. ca 120), daughter of an unknown father and his wife Claudia Tisamenis (b. ca 100), sister of Herodes Atticus. It appears in this family tree that the person who was related to Herodes Atticus was Gordian I&#x27;s mother or grandmother and not his wife. But the late Antony Birley stated that the question remains open.

Also according to the &quot;Historia&quot;, the wife of Gordian I was a Roman woman called Fabia Orestilla, born circa 165, whom the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; claims was a descendant of emperors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius through her father Fulvus Antoninus. Modern historians have dismissed this name and her information as false.

With his wife, Gordian I had at least two children: a son of the same name and a daughter, Maecia Faustina (who was the mother of the future Emperor Gordian III). His wife died before 238 AD. Christian Settipani identified her parents as Marcus Annius Severus, who was a Suffect Consul, and his wife Silvana, born circa 140 AD, who was the daughter of Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus and his wife Aurelia Fadilla, the daughter of Antoninus Pius and wife Annia Galeria Faustina or Faustina the Elder.

==Early life==
Gordian steadily climbed the Roman imperial hierarchy when he became part of the Roman Senate. His political career started relatively late in his life and his early years were probably spent in rhetoric and literary studies. As a military man, Gordian commanded the Legio IV Scythica when the legion was stationed in Syria. He served as governor of Roman Britain in 216 AD and was a suffect consul sometime during the reign of Elagabalus. Inscriptions in Roman Britain bearing his name were partially erased suggesting some form of imperial displeasure during this role.

While he gained unbounded popularity on account of the magnificent games and shows he produced as aedile, his prudent and retired life did not excite the suspicion of Caracalla, in whose honor he wrote a long epic poem called &quot;Antoninias&quot;. Gordian certainly retained his wealth and political clout during the chaotic times of the Severan dynasty which suggests a personal dislike for intrigue. Philostratus dedicated his work &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot; to either him or his son, Gordian II.

==Rise to power==

During the reign of Alexander Severus, Gordian I (who was by then in his late sixties), after serving his suffect consulship prior to 223, drew lots for the proconsular governorship of the province of Africa Proconsularis which he assumed in 237. However, prior to the commencement of his promagistrature, Maximinus Thrax killed Alexander Severus at Moguntiacum in Germania Inferior and assumed the throne.

Maximinus was not a popular emperor and universal discontent increased due to his oppressive rule. It culminated in a revolt in Africa in 238 AD (the exact month is unknown). After Maximinus&#x27; fiscal curator was murdered in a riot, people turned to Gordian and demanded that he accept the dangerous honor of the imperial throne. Gordian, who was about 80 years according to Herodian, eventually yielded to the popular clamour and assumed both the purple and the &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Africanus&quot;.

According to Edward Gibbon:

An iniquitous sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of [Africa], the execution of which would have stripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony. (...) A respite of three days, obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treasurer, was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants blindly devoted to the commands of their lords and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes. The leaders of the conspiracy, as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator, stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments, and, by the assistance of their tumultuary train, seized on the little town of Thysdrus, and erected the standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the Roman empire. (...) Gordianus, their proconsul, and the object of their choice [as emperor], refused, with unfeigned reluctance, the dangerous honour, and begged with tears that they should suffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life, without staining his feeble age with civil blood. Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple, his only refuge indeed against the jealous cruelty of Maximin (...).

Due to his advanced age, he insisted that his son be associated with him. A few days later, Gordian entered the city of Carthage with the overwhelming support of the population and local political leaders. Gordian I sent assassins to kill Maximinus&#x27; praetorian prefect, Publius Aelius Vitalianus, and the rebellion seemed to be successful. Gordian, in the meantime, had sent an embassy to Rome, under the leadership of Publius Licinius Valerianus, to obtain the Senate&#x27;s support for his rebellion. The Senate confirmed the new emperor and many of the provinces gladly sided with Gordian. This event is sometimes dated to 2 April, but this is only based on a passage of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, nowadays considered highly unreliable, that told about an eclipse presaging the imminent fall of the Gordians.

Opposition came from the neighboring province of Numidia. Capelianus, governor of Numidia and a loyal supporter of Maximinus Thrax, held a grudge against Gordian and invaded the African province with the only legion stationed in the region, III &quot;Augusta&quot;, and other veteran units. Gordian II, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers, lost the Battle of Carthage and was killed, and Gordian I killed himself by hanging himself with his belt. The Gordians had ruled only 22 days, the 2nd shortest reign of any Roman emperor behind Quintillus who ruled for 17 days during the crisis of the 3rd century. Gordian I was the first emperor to commit suicide since Otho in 69 during the Year of the Four Emperors.

==Legacy==
Gordian&#x27;s positive reputation can be attributed to his reportedly amiable character. Both he and his son were said to be fond of literature, even publishing their own voluminous works. While they were strongly interested in intellectual pursuits, they possessed neither the necessary skills nor resources to be considered able statesmen or powerful rulers. Having embraced the cause of Gordian, the Senate was obliged to continue the revolt against Maximinus following Gordian&#x27;s death, appointing Pupienus and Balbinus as joint emperors. Nevertheless, by the end of 238, the recognised emperor would be Gordian III, Gordian I&#x27;s grandson.

<text>Gordian II (; 192 – April 238) was briefly Roman emperor with his father Gordian I in 238 AD, the Year of the Six Emperors. Seeking to overthrow Maximinus Thrax, he died in battle outside Carthage. Since he died before his father, Gordian II had the shortest recorded reign of any Roman emperor, at about 22 days.

==Early life==
Born 192, Gordian II was the only known son of Gordian I, who was said to be related to prominent senators. His praenomen and nomen &quot;Marcus Antonius&quot; suggest that his paternal ancestors received Roman citizenship under the triumvir Mark Antony, or one of his daughters, during the late Roman Republic. Gordian&#x27;s cognomen &quot;Gordianus&quot; suggests that his family origins were from Anatolia, especially Galatia and Cappadocia.

According to the notoriously unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, his mother was a Roman woman called Fabia Orestilla, born circa 165, who the &quot;Historia&quot; claims was a descendant of emperors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius through her father Fulvus Antoninus. Modern historians have dismissed this name and her information as false. There is some evidence to suggest that Gordian&#x27;s mother might have been the granddaughter of the Greek Sophist, consul and tutor Herodes Atticus. His younger sister was Maecia Faustina, who was the mother of Emperor Gordian III.

Although the memory of the Gordians would have been cherished by the Senate and thus appear sympathetic in any senatorial documentation of the period, the only account of Gordian&#x27;s early career that has survived is contained within the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, and it cannot be taken as an accurate or reliable description of his life story prior to his elevation to the purple in 238. According to this source, Gordian served as quaestor in Elagabalus&#x27; reign and as praetor and consul suffect with Emperor Severus Alexander. In 237 or 238, Gordian went to the province of Africa Proconsularis as a legatus under his father, who served as proconsular governor.

==Revolt against Maximinus Thrax==
Early in 235, Emperor Alexander Severus and his mother Julia Avita Mamaea were assassinated by mutinous troops at Moguntiacum (now Mainz) in Germania Inferior. The leader of the rebellion, Maximinus Thrax, became Emperor, despite his low-born background and the disapproval of the Roman Senate. Confronted by a local elite that had just killed Maximinus&#x27;s procurator, Gordian&#x27;s father was forced to participate in a full-scale revolt against Maximinus in 238, probably at the end of March. Due to Gordian I&#x27;s advanced age, the younger Gordian, said to be 46 years old, was attached to the imperial throne and acclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; too. Like his father, he too was awarded the &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Africanus&quot;.

Father and son saw their claim to the throne ratified both by the Senate and most of the other provinces, due to Maximinus&#x27; unpopularity.

Opposition would come from the neighbouring province of Numidia. Capelianus, governor of Numidia, a loyal supporter of Maximinus Thrax, and who held a grudge against Gordian, renewed his allegiance to the reigning emperor and invaded Africa (province) with the only legion stationed in the region, III &quot;Augusta&quot;, and other veteran units. Gordian II, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers, lost the Battle of Carthage and was killed. According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, his body was never recovered. Hearing the news, his father killed himself. The Gordians ruled only 22 days. This first rebellion against Maximinus Thrax was unsuccessful, but by the end of 238 Gordian II&#x27;s nephew, Gordian III, would be recognised as emperor by the whole Roman world.

According to Edward Gibbon, in the first volume of &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776–89), &quot;Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested to the variety of [Gordian&#x27;s] inclinations; and from the productions that he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than ostentation.&quot;

<doc id="140725" wikidata="Q643532" url="?curid=140725" title="Anti-ship missile">
<text>An anti-ship missile (AShM or ASM) is a guided missile that is designed for use against ships and large boats. Most anti-ship missiles are of the sea-skimming variety, and many use a combination of inertial guidance and active radar homing. A large number of other anti-ship missiles use infrared homing to follow the heat that is emitted by a ship; it is also possible for anti-ship missiles to be guided by radio command all the way.

Many anti-ship missiles can be launched from a variety of weapons systems including surface warships (also referred to as ship-to-ship missiles), submarines, bombers, fighter planes, patrol planes, helicopters, shore batteries, land vehicles, and, conceivably, even infantrymen firing shoulder-launched missiles. The term [[surface-to-surface missile]] (SSM) is used when appropriate. The longer-range anti-ship missiles are often called anti-ship cruise missiles. Several countries are also developing anti-ship ballistic missiles.

==Etymology==
Both &quot;AShM&quot; and “ASM” are utilized interchangeably as an acronym for &quot;anti-ship missile.&quot; &quot;AShM&quot; may be the preferred acronym when confusion with &quot;air-to-surface missile&quot; (commonly abbreviated as &quot;ASM&quot;) may occur.

==History==
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union turned to a sea-denial strategy concentrating on submarines, naval mines and the AShM. One of the first products of the decision was the SS-N-2 Styx missile. Further products were to follow, and they were soon loaded onto the Soviet Air Force&#x27;s Tu-95 Bear and Tu-22 Blinder bombers, in the case of the air-launched KS-1 Komet.

In 1967, the Israeli Navy&#x27;s destroyer was the first ship to be sunk by a ship-launched missile—a number of Styx missiles launched by Egyptian s off the Sinai Peninsula.

In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 the Indian Navy conducted two raids using s employing the Styx on the Pakistani naval base at Karachi. These raids resulted in the destruction or crippling of approximately two thirds of the Pakistani Navy. Major losses included two destroyers, a fleet oiler, an ammunition ship, approximately a dozen merchant ships, and numerous smaller craft. Major shore-based facilities, including fuel storage tanks and naval installations were also destroyed. The Osas returned to base without loss.

The Battle of Latakia in 1973 (during the Yom Kippur/Ramadan War) was the scene of the world&#x27;s first combat between missile boats. In this battle, the Israeli Navy destroyed Syrian warships without suffering any damage, using electronic countermeasures and ruses for defense. After defeating the Syrian Navy the Israeli missile boats also sank a number of Egyptian warships, again without suffering any damage in return, thus achieving total naval supremacy for the rest of the war.

Anti-ship missiles were used in the 1982 Falklands War. The British warship , a Type 42 destroyer, was struck by a single air-launched Exocet and later sank as a result of the damage. The container ship was hit by two Exocets and burnt out and subsequently sank while under tow. was damaged when she was struck by an MM38, a ship-launched version of the Exocet, fired from a launcher taken from the Argentine Navy destroyer ARA &quot;Comodoro Seguí&quot; and mounted on a trailer by Navy technicians, but she had taken evasive action that limited the damage.
In 1987, a US Navy guided-missile frigate, , was hit by an Exocet anti-ship missile fired by an Iraqi Mirage F-1 fighter plane. &quot;Stark&quot; was damaged, but she was able to steam to a friendly port for temporary repairs.

In October 1987, &quot;Sungari&quot;, an American-owned tanker steaming under the Liberian flag, and , a Kuwaiti tanker steaming under the American flag, were hit by Iranian HY-2 missiles.

In 1988 AShMs were fired by both American and Iranian forces in Operation Praying Mantis in the Persian Gulf. During this naval battle, several Iranian warships were hit by American AShMs (and by the US Navy&#x27;s Standard missiles—surface-to-air missiles which were doing double-duty in the anti-ship role). The US Navy hit the Iranian Navy frigate Sahand with three Harpoon missiles, four AGM-123 Skipper rocket-propelled bombs, a Walleye TV-guided bomb, and several &quot;iron bombs&quot;. Despite the large number of munitions and successful hits, &quot;Sahand&quot; did not sink until fire reached her ammunition magazine, causing it to detonate, sinking the vessel. In the same engagement, American warships fired three Standard missiles at an Iranian Navy corvette. This corvette had such a low profile above the water that a Harpoon missile that arrived several minutes later could not lock onto it with its targeting radars.

In 2006, Lebanese Hezbollah fighters fired an AShM at the Israeli corvette , inflicting battle damage, but this warship managed to return to Israel in one piece and under its own power. A second missile in this same salvo struck and sank an Egyptian merchant ship.
On 13 April 2022, the Ukrainian government claimed to have hit the Russian cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot; with two R-360 Neptune missiles, resulting in its sinking. The Russian government did not confirm the attack, but admitted that the ship sank after a fire. If Ukrainian claims are true, &quot;Moskva&quot; might be the largest warship ever disabled or destroyed by a missile, according to Carl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command&#x27;s Joint Intelligence Center.

==Threat posed==


Anti-ship missiles are a significant threat to surface ships, which have large radar, radio, and thermal signatures that are difficult to suppress. Once acquired, a ship cannot outrun or out-turn a missile, the warhead of which can inflict significant damage. To counter the threat posed, the modern surface combatant has to either avoid being detected, destroy the missile launch platform before it fires its missiles, or decoy or destroy all of the incoming missiles.
Modern navies have spent much time and effort developing counters to the threat of anti-ship missiles since the Second World War. Anti-ship missiles have been the driving force behind many aspects of modern ship design, especially in navies that operate aircraft carriers.

The first layer of antimissile defense by a modern, fully equipped aircraft carrier task force is always the long-range missile-carrying fighter planes of the aircraft carrier itself. Several fighters are kept on combat air patrol (CAP) 24 hours a day, seven days a week when at sea, and many more are put aloft when the situation warrants, such as during wartime or when a threat to the task force is detected.

These fighters patrol up to hundreds of miles away from the task force and they are equipped with airborne radar systems. When spotting an approaching aircraft on a threatening flight profile, it is the responsibility of the CAP to intercept it before any missile is launched. If this cannot be achieved in time, the missiles themselves can be targeted by the fighters&#x27;s own weapons systems, usually their air-to-air missiles, but &quot;in extremis&quot;, by their rapid-fire cannon.

However, some AShMs might &quot;leak&quot; past the task force&#x27;s fighter defenses. In addition, many modern warships operate independently of carrier-based air protection and they must provide their own defenses against missiles and aircraft. Under these circumstances, the ships themselves must utilize multilayered defenses which have been built into them.

For example, some warships, such as the US Navy&#x27;s guided missile cruisers, the guided missile destroyers, and the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 45 guided missile destroyer, use a combination of radar systems, integrated computer fire-control systems, and agile surface-to-air missiles (SAM) to simultaneously track, engage, and destroy several incoming anti-ship missiles or hostile warplanes at a time.

The primary American defensive system, called the Aegis Combat System, is also used by the navies of Japan, Spain, Norway, South Korea, and Australia. The Aegis system has been designed to defend against mass attacks by hostile anti-ship missiles or warplanes.

Any missiles that can elude the interception by medium-ranges SAM missiles can then be either deceived with electronic countermeasures or decoys; shot down by short-range missiles such as the Sea Sparrow or the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM); engaged by the warship&#x27;s main gun armament (if present); or, as a last resort, destroyed by a close-in weapon system (CIWS), such as the American Phalanx CIWS, Russian Kashtan CIWS, or the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS.

===Current threats and vulnerabilities===

To counter these defense systems, countries such as Russia are developing or deploying missiles that slowly cruise at a very low level (about five meters above sea level) to within a short range of their target and then, at the point when radar detection becomes inevitable, initiate a supersonic, high-agility sprint (potentially with anti-aircraft missile detection and evasion) to close the terminal distance. Missiles, such as the SS-N-27 Sizzler, that incorporate this sort of threat modality are regarded by US Navy analysts as potentially being able to penetrate the US Navy&#x27;s defensive systems.

Recent years have seen a growing amount of attention being paid to the possibility of ballistic missiles being re-purposed or designed for an anti-ship role. Speculation has focused on the development of such missiles for use by China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy. Such an anti-ship ballistic missile would approach its target extremely rapidly, making it very difficult to intercept. In response to China&#x27;s development of anti-ship missiles and other anti-access/area denial capabilities, the United States has developed the AirSea Battle doctrine.

==Countermeasures and defenses==

Countermeasures against anti-ship missiles include 
* Surface-to-air missiles 
* Close-in weapon systems (CIWS), including the Soviet-or Russian-made AK-630 or Kashtan, Turkish Aselsan GOKDENIZ, German Millennium Gun or the Phalanx and Goalkeeper. These are automated gun systems mounted on the deck of a ship that use radar to track the approaching missile, and then attempt to shoot it down during its final approach to the target.
* Anti-aircraft guns such as the Mk 45 naval gun or the AK-130
* Electronic warfare equipment (such as AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite)
* Decoy systems (such as chaff, the US Navy&#x27;s Mark 36 SRBOC system), and flares, or more active decoys such as the Nulka

Ships that employ some stealth technology can reduce the risk of detection and make themselves a harder target for the missile through the use of passive countermeasures including:
* reduction of their radar cross section (RCS) and hence radar signature.
* limiting the ship&#x27;s infrared and acoustic signature.

===History of combat interceptions===

====Gulf War====
On February 25, 1991, during the first Gulf War, the Phalanx-equipped was a few miles from and the destroyer . The ships were attacked by an Iraqi Silkworm missile (often referred to as the Seersucker), at which &quot;Missouri&quot; fired its SRBOC chaff. The Phalanx system on &quot;Jarrett&quot;, operating in the automatic target-acquisition mode, fixed upon &quot;Missouri&quot;″s chaff, releasing a burst of rounds. From this burst, four rounds hit &quot;Missouri&quot; which was from &quot;Jarrett&quot; at the time. There were no injuries. A Sea Dart missile was then launched from HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot;, which destroyed the Iraqi missile, achieving the first successful engagement of a missile by a missile during combat at sea.

====2016 attacks off the coast of Yemen====
On 9 October 2016, , operating near the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, was targeted by two missiles fired from Houthi-controlled territory. Both missiles fell short and crashed into the water. The Houthi insurgency denied launching the attack on the warship. The United States Naval Institute reported that &quot;Mason&quot; fired two SM-2 Standard missiles and one RIM-162 ESSM missile to intercept the two missiles, and deployed her Nulka missile decoy. One of two U.S. defense officials cited anonymously added that it was not clear whether the incoming missiles had been shot down or crashed into the water on their own. This marked the first recorded instance of ship-based anti-air missiles being fired from vertical launching cells in combat in response to an actual inbound missile threat.

On 12 October 2016 was again targeted by missiles fired from Yemeni territory, while it was operating in the Bab el-Mandeb strait. &quot;Mason&quot; was not hit by the two missiles, which were fired from near the southern Yemen city of Al Hudaydah. While the Navy was not certain whether the first incoming missile was intercepted or instead just fell into the sea, officials said &quot;Mason&quot; successfully intercepted the second missile at a distance of about , marking the first time in history a warship destroyed an inbound anti-ship missile with a SAM in actual self-defense. On 13 October 2016, the U.S. attacked three radar sites in Houthi-held territory which had been involved in the earlier missile attacks, with cruise missiles launched from &quot;Nitze&quot;. The Pentagon assessed that all three sites were destroyed.

On 15 October 2016, was targeted in a third attack by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, by five anti-ship cruise missiles while operating in the Red Sea north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait. &quot;Mason&quot; fired a radar decoy, an infrared decoy, and several SM-2 Standard missiles in response, either neutralizing or intercepting four of the five incoming missiles. The Navy reported the fifth incoming missile as neutralized by a radar decoy launched from &quot;Nitze&quot;, after &quot;Mason&quot; alerted her to the threat.

====2023 Houthi missile attacks====
On 26 December 2023, the USS &quot;Laboon&quot; shot down three ASBMs in the Red Sea fired by Houthi rebels with multiple SM-6s. This was its first intercept of a ballistic missile in combat.

On 30 December 2023, Danish container ship Maersk Hangzhou issued a distress call after coming under fire from four small ships commanded by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen. Attempts were also made to board Maersk Hangzhou by force, while a contracted security team defended the ship. and aircraft carrier responded to a distress call from the container ship. Verbal commands were radioed to the Houthi ships, while helicopters from Eisenhower were dispatched. After taking small arms fire, U.S. Navy helicopters returned fire, sinking three of the four Houthi ships. There was no damage to U.S. equipment or personnel. In the process of responding to the distress call, &quot;Gravely&quot; shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Yemen.

On Jan. 9, at approximately 9:15 p.m. (Sanaa time), Iranian-backed Houthis launched a complex attack of Iranian designed one-way attack UAVs (OWA UAVs), anti-ship cruise missiles, and an anti-ship ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Southern Red Sea, towards international shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting. Eighteen OWA UAVs, two anti-ship cruise missiles, and one anti-ship ballistic missile were shot down by a combined effort of F/A-18s from , , &quot;USS Laboon (DDG 58)&quot;, USS , and the United Kingdom’s . This is the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea since Nov. 19. There were no injuries or damage reported.

On 14 January 2024, an anti-ship missile was fired in the direction of &quot;Laboon&quot; from a Houthi-controlled portion of Yemen, according to CENTCOM. Two weeks later, on 30 January 2024, the USS &quot;Carney&quot; shot down an ASBM in the Gulf of Aden fired by Houthi rebels with an SM-6.

On 30 January 2024, &quot;USS Gravely&quot; used its Phalanx CIWS to shoot down an incoming anti-ship cruise missile fired by the Houthis. U.S. officials said that the missile came within a mile of the destroyer. No damage or injuries were reported.

On February 6, 2024 at 4:30 p.m., while patrolling in the Gulf of Aden, &quot;USS Laboon (DDG 58)&quot;, operating near M/V Star Nasia, intercepted and shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Iranian-backed Houthis. Later in the month, on 20 February 2024 at 12:30 a.m., while operating in the Gulf of Aden, &quot;Laboon&quot; detected and shot down one anti-ship cruise missile fired by the Houthis.

<text>Narseh (also spelled Narses or Narseus; ) was the seventh King of Kings of Sasanian Iran from 293 to 303.

The youngest son of Shapur I (), Narseh served as the governor of Sakastan, Hind and Turan under his father. Shapur I was eventually succeeded by his son Hormizd I (), who died after a reign of one year. Shapur I&#x27;s eldest son Bahram I, who had never been considered as a candidate for succession to the throne by his father, ascended the throne with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir. He then made a settlement with Narseh to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of Armenia, which was a persistent cause for war between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. Narseh held the title of &quot;Vazurg Šāh Arminān&quot; (&quot;Great King of Armenia&quot;), which was used by the heir to the throne in the early Sasanian times. Nevertheless, Narseh most likely still viewed Bahram I as a usurper.

The succession of Bahram I&#x27;s son, Bahram II () seemingly occurred without any issues. After Bahram II&#x27;s death in 293, his son Bahram III was unwillingly crowned by a nobleman named Wahnam. The rest of the nobility did not support Bahram III&#x27;s kingship, and asked Narseh to rule instead. Ultimately, Bahram III abdicated as shah, while Wahnam was executed. Narseh was the first Sasanian shah to not ascend the throne as a crown prince. The circumstances of his rise to power are detailed in the Paikuli inscription, which he made as his own &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot; and to legitimize his rule.

Three years after Narseh&#x27;s accession, war erupted between the Sasanians and Romans once again. In 296 or 297, Narseh&#x27;s forces inflicted a defeat on the forces of Galerius at the Battle of Carrhae. The following year, however, Narseh suffered a major defeat at Satala; his wives, children, and many Iranian nobles were taken as prisoners of war. Due to this ignominious defeat, Narseh was forced to accept a peace treaty prescribed by the Romans, ceding them several areas at the Sasanian-Roman border.

Narseh is notable for returning to the religious tolerance policy of his father.

== Name ==
The name of Narseh stems from the Old Iranian theophoric name of &quot;*naryasa(n)ha-&quot;, meaning &quot;men&#x27;s praise&quot;. Narseh&#x27;s name is listed as &quot;nrshy&quot; in Middle Persian and &quot;nryshw&quot; in Parthian on the Paikuli inscription and Naqsh-e Rostam. The Greek version of his name is also listed in the inscriptions, as &quot;Narsaiēs&quot; or &quot;Narsaios&quot;. However, other Greek sources generally spell his name as &quot;Narsēs&quot;. The name of Narseh is known in other languages as; ; Syriac ܢܪܣܝ &quot;Nrsy&quot;; &quot;Narsi&quot;; Armenian &quot;Nerseh&quot;; Coptic &quot;Narsaph&quot;, as well as &quot;Narseos&quot;.

==Early life and governorship==
Narseh seems to have been the youngest son of Shapur I, being born between 228 and 233 during the reign of his grandfather Ardashir I (). Narseh is quoted in an inscription by his father Shapur I as the governor of the eastern Sasanian provinces of Hind, Sakastan and Turan. During his term as governor, he reportedly played an important role in the affairs of the eastern portion of the empire. Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by Hormizd I, whose rule only lasted one year due to death. Narseh&#x27;s older brother Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by their father, probably due to having a mother of lowly origin, ascended the throne with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir.

He then made a settlement with Narseh to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of Armenia, which was constantly the source of war between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. Narseh held the title of &quot;Vazurg Šāh Arminān&quot; (&quot;Great King of Armenia&quot;), which was used by the heir to the throne. Nevertheless, Narseh still most likely viewed Bahram I as a usurper. Bahram I&#x27;s reign however, lasted shortly, ending on September 274 with his death. His son Bahram II succeeded him as shah, seemingly without any issues; he may have been aided by Kartir to ascend the throne over Narseh. This most likely frustrated Narseh, who had now been neglected from succession several times.

==Rise==

Following the death of Bahram II in 293, his son Bahram III was unwillingly proclaimed shah in Pars by a group of nobles led by Wahnam and supported by Adurfarrobay, governor of Meshan. However, Bahram III was considered a weak ruler by the other nobles, who decided to pledge allegiance to Narseh, the last remaining son of Shapur, and someone who was perceived as being a stronger leader and one who would be able to bring glory to Iran. Four months into Bahram III&#x27;s reign, Narseh was summoned to Mesopotamia at the request of many members of the Iranian nobility. He met them in the passage of Paikuli in the province of Garmekan, where he was firmly approved and likely also declared shah for the first time. The reasons behind the nobles favour of Narseh might have been due to his jurisdiction as governor, his image as an advocate of the Zoroastrian religion and as an insurer for harmony and prosperity of the empire. His ancestry from the early Sasanian family probably also played a role.

In order to avoid bloodshed, Narseh proposed to make peace with both Bahram III and Wahnam. Both seem to have agreed, as no accounts of battles have been made. The reason behind Bahram III and Wahnam&#x27;s quick agreement to peace may have been due to desertion amongst many of Bahram III&#x27;s men. Bahram III abdicated as shah and was probably spared, whilst Wahnam was executed when Narseh entered the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Narseh then summoned the aristocrats to take part in the royal referendum, a ritual which had been used since the first Sasanian shah, Ardashir I (), and which Narseh now made use of in order to gain the approval of the aristocracy as a legitimate ruler instead that of a usurper. Narseh was decisively voted in favour by the majority, and guaranteed &quot;to enter the throne of our father and our forefathers with the help of the Gods, in their name and that of our forefathers.&quot; Amongst those nobles who supported Narseh was the leading priest Kartir, which is attested in the Paikuli inscription.

==Reign==
===War with the Romans===
====Background====

When Narseh ascended the throne, the eastern portion of Mesopotamia (since 244) and all of Armenia (since 252) were under Iranian rule. The notion that the western part of Armenia had been given to the Arsacid prince Tiridates III has been questioned. According to historian Ursula Weber, &quot;It is quite certain&quot; that the whole of Armenia continued to be a part of the Sasanian Empire in the 3rd century, until it was later ceded to the Romans in 298/9 after the Peace of Nisibis. The proposition of Narseh presumably following Shapur I&#x27;s expansionistic approach does not match with his testimony in the Paikuli inscription; &quot;And Caesar and the Romans were in gratitude (?) and peace and friendship with us.&quot; Contrary to the testimony, however, the two empires soon clashed with each other−in 296. From a Roman viewpoint, the mutual relations with Iran had been heavily strained due to the aggressive and expansionistic approach of Ardashir I and Shapur I. However, the conclusive causes for the Roman offensive was possibly due to their territorial losses and the disadvantageous change in the sphere of authority and influence in the Mesopotamian-Armenian lands in the 240s and 250s.

==== The war ====

Galerius, &quot;Caesar&quot; under Emperor Diocletian, invaded Mesopotamia, which Narseh had occupied hoping to check his advance. Three battles were fought subsequently, the first two of which were indecisive. In the third fought at Callinicum, Galerius suffered a complete defeat and was forced to retreat. Galerius crossed the Euphrates into Syria to join his father-in-law Diocletian at Antioch. On his arrival at Antioch, Galerius was rebuked by Diocletian who disgraced him for his shameful defeat at the hands of Narseh. Vowing to take revenge, Galerius made preparations throughout the winter of 297 and invaded Armenia with 25,000 men.

Supported by the Armenians, Galerius surprised Narseh in his camp at the Battle of Satala and inflicted a crushing defeat on the latter, forcing him to flee in haste. His wife, prisoners, his sisters and a number of his children were captured apart from his prodigious military chest. Eastern Mesopotamia was recovered by the Romans and Tiridates was reinstated as the monarch of Armenia.

==== Peace negotiations ====
Anxious to make peace with the Romans, Narseh dispatched his envoy Aphraban to Galerius with the following message:

But Galerius dismissed Aphraban without giving any definite answer, at the same time accusing the Iranians of ill-treating Valerian. In the meantime, he consulted Diocletian at Nisibis, and he persuaded Galerius to offer terms of peace to the Iranians. Accordingly, terms of peace were agreed upon, and were ratified by a treaty concluded by Narseh with the Romans.

According to this treaty,

* Five provinces beyond the Tigris were to be ceded to the Romans. One writer gives these provinces as Ingilene, Sophene, Arzanene, Corduene, and Zabdicene; by another as Arzanene, Moxoene, Zabdicene, Rehimene, and Corduene.
* The semi-independent kingdom of Armenia was to be extended up to the fortress of Zintha, in Media.
* Iran was expected to relinquish all her rights over Iberia.
* Formal dealings between Iran and Rome would henceforth be conducted at Nisibis.

Narseh did not survive for long after the conclusion of this humiliating treaty. He died in 303 and was succeeded by his son, Hormizd II.

== Coinage ==
The title of Narseh on his coins was the typical &quot;Mazdēsn bay Narsē šāhān šāh Ērān ud Anērān kēčihr az yazdān&quot; (&quot;the Mazda-worshiping, divine Narseh, King of Kings of Iran(ians) and non-Iran(ians), whose image/brilliance is from the gods&quot;). The iconography of Narseh&#x27;s coins can be categorized into three phases. The first and second phases portray him wearing a palmette crown, albeit with two different hairstyles. In the third phase, he is wearing a lamellar crown along with a different hairstyle.

==The Paikuli inscription==
The Paikuli inscription in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan is the only source that describes the reign of Bahram III and the rise of Narseh to the throne. Unlike Shapur I&#x27;s inscription at the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht, the Paikuli inscription omits the use of Greek, but still uses Parthian and Middle Persian. This, however, marks the last time that Parthian is used in Sasanian royal records. The inscription, along with Shapur I&#x27;s inscription, demonstrates that the organization of the early Sasanian Empire did not contrast much to its predecessor, the Parthian Empire. Like the Parthian monarch, the Sasanian monarch used the title of Shahanshah (&quot;King of Kings&quot;), ruling as the overlord of other lesser kings, such as the king of Adiabene.

== Rock relief ==

While ruling as king of Iran, Narseh had a rock relief carved at Naqsh-e Rostam, between the burial site of the Achaemenid kings Darius the Great () and Xerxes I (). The relief depicts an investiture scene, with Narseh, wearing a lamellar crown, surrounded by his family. Narseh is receiving the ring of kingship from a female figure that is frequently assumed to be the goddess Anahita. However, some scholars have suggested that this might be his queen, Shapurdukhtak. The figure standing behind Narseh is most likely the crown prince Hormizd, due to his cap being the form of that of an animal protome, which was typically worn by Sasanian heirs.

== Titles ==
Throughout his lifetime, Narseh is known to have had several titles, attested in contemporary chronicles, four inscriptions (ŠKZ, NVŠ, NPi, ŠṬBn-I) and his coins.

* As governor of Hind, Sakastan and Turan; &quot;ēr mazdēsn Narseh, šāh Hind, Sagestān ud Turestān tā drayā damb&quot; (&quot;the Iranian, Mazda-worshipping Narseh, king of Hind(estan), Sagestan and Turan up to the seacoast&quot;).
* As governor of Armenia: &quot;šāh Armenān&quot; (&quot;King of Armenia&quot;).
* During his rule as king of Iran, he assumed the titles of his predecessors: ptkly ZNH mzdysn bgy nlsḥy MLKʾn MLKʾ ʾyrʾn W ʾnyrʾn MNW ctry MN yzdʾn, &quot;This (is) the image of the Mazda-worshipping god Narseh, king of kings of Eran and Aneran, whose seed (is) from the gods&quot; in the inscription of his brother, Bahram I, which he had altered.
* The title of &quot;Narseh ī Abzūdxwarrah&quot; (&quot;Narseh, whose xwarrah blossoms&quot;), which Narseh had most likely received by his supporters at the gathering at Paikuli.

<doc id="140727" wikidata="Q1197966" url="?curid=140727" title="The Road to Wigan Pier">
<text>The Road to Wigan Pier is a book by the English writer George Orwell, first published in 1937. The first half of this work documents his sociological investigations of the bleak living conditions among the working class in Lancashire and Yorkshire in the industrial north of England before World War II. The second half is a long essay on his middle-class upbringing, and the development of his political conscience, questioning British attitudes towards socialism. Orwell states plainly that he himself is in favour of socialism, but feels it necessary to point out reasons why many people who would benefit from socialism, and should logically support it, are in practice likely to be strong opponents.

According to Orwell biographer Bernard Crick, publisher Victor Gollancz first tried to persuade Orwell&#x27;s agent to allow the Left Book Club edition to consist solely of the descriptive first half of the book. When this was refused Gollancz wrote an introduction to the book. &quot;Victor could not bear to reject it, even though his suggestion that the &#x27;repugnant&#x27; second half should be omitted from the Club edition was turned down. On this occasion Victor, albeit nervously, did overrule Communist Party objections in favour of his publishing instinct. His compromise was to publish the book with [an introduction] full of good criticism, unfair criticism, and half-truths.&quot;

The book grapples &quot;with the social and historical reality of Depression suffering in the north of England,Orwell does not wish merely to enumerate evils and injustices, but to break through what he regards as middle-class oblivion,Orwell&#x27;s corrective to such falsity comes first by immersion of his own bodya supreme measure of truth for Orwelldirectly into the experience of misery.&quot;

==Background==
Orwell submitted the typescript of &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; to Gollancz on 15 January 1936. At some point in the next few days Gollancz asked him to consider a new projectwriting a book about unemployment and social conditions in economically depressed northern England. In the period from 31 January to 30 March 1936, Orwell lived in Wigan, Barnsley and Sheffield researching the book.

Gollancz was not only a successful publisher but also a dedicated social reformer. &quot;As a social reformer, a socialist, and an idealist, Gollancz had an unquestioning, perhaps overly optimistic, faith in education; if only people could be made to know the nature of poverty, he thought, they would want to eradicate it, remove from power the government that tolerated it, and transform the economic system that brought it into being.&quot; As a successful publisher however, he knew that to reach a large audience he needed something more than a collection of facts, statistics, graphs and dogmatic conclusions.

The view that this was a specific commission with a £500 advancetwo years&#x27; income for Orwell at the timeis based on a recollection by Geoffrey Gorer who was interviewed for Melvyn Bragg&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Omnibus&quot; in 1970. He reported that Gollancz had offered Orwell £500 to underwrite the trip, and but for Gollancz&#x27;s support Orwell would never have gone. Recent biographers, however, do not repeat this account. On 1 April 1936, Orwell rented a cottage in the remote village of Wallington, Hertfordshire, where he wrote &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;. Biographer Michael Shelden points out that the rental for the cottage was less than £2 a month.

Orwell, as well as living off the land, supplemented his income by running the cottage as the village store. Yet, writing to Jack Common in April 1936 about setting up shop, &quot;Orwell sounds hard put to find £20 in order to stock his shelves, rather than a man who had received £500 a couple of months earlier.&quot; When it came to marrying, Orwell wrote to Gorer: &quot;I should never be economically justified in marrying, so might as well be unjustified now as later&quot;. D. J. Taylor argues that these factors, and the fact that Gollancz was not a person to part with such a sum on speculation, suggest that Gorer was confusing Orwell&#x27;s eventual earnings from the book with a small contribution for out-of-pocket expenses that Gollancz might have given him.

Orwell set out on the journey on the last day of January 1936, having given up his job at &quot;Booklovers&#x27; Corner&quot; and his flat in Kentish Town; he would not live in London again until 1940. He made no plans, but Richard Rees promised to send him names of people in the north connected with &quot;The Adelphi&quot; or the Adelphi Summer School who might help himOrwell also established a network of contacts through the National Unemployed Workers&#x27; Movement. One of these NUWM contacts was Jack Hilton, a working-class author from Rochdale. Orwell wrote to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for advice on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale, &quot;for there are the colliers and they’re good stuff.&quot; For the next two months Orwell followed a route from Birmingham to Manchester to Leeds. He kept a diary from 31 January to 25 March, which records the unretouched material that he would develop into the first part of &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;.

For three weeks in February 1936 he was in Wigan, the longest single stop he would make; March was allotted to YorkshireSheffield, Leeds, Barnsley. He had completed a rough first draft of the book by October and sent off the final version to Moore in December.
Gollancz published the work under the Left Book Club, which gave Orwell a far higher circulation than his previous works. However, Gollancz feared the second half would offend Left Book Club readers and inserted a mollifying preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain. The original edition included 32 illustrations that were photographs of Welsh coal miners and of slums in the East End of London. Orwell did not choose the images and their inclusion may not have been his idea.

==Structure==
The book is divided into two sections.

;Part One
George Orwell set out to report on working-class life in the bleak industrial heartlands of the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire. He spent his time living among the people and as such his descriptions are detailed and vivid.

* Chapter One describes the life of the Brooker family, a more wealthy example of the northern working class. They have a shop and cheap lodging house in their home. Orwell describes the old people who live in the home and their living conditions.
* Chapter Two describes the life of miners and conditions down a coal mine. Orwell describes how he went down a coal mine to observe proceedings and he explains how the coal is distributed. The working conditions are very poor. This is the part of the book most often quoted.
* Chapter Three describes the social situation of the average miner. Hygienic and financial conditions are discussed. Orwell explains why most miners do not actually earn as much as they are sometimes believed to.
* Chapter Four describes the housing situation in the industrial north. There is a housing shortage in the region and therefore people are more likely to accept substandard housing. The housing conditions are very poor.
* Chapter Five explores unemployment and Orwell explains that the unemployment statistics of the time are misleading.
* Chapter Six deals with the food of the average miner and how, although they generally have enough money to buy food, most families prefer to buy something tasty to enrich their dull lives. This leads to malnutrition and physical degeneration in many families.
* Chapter Seven describes the ugliness of the industrial towns in the north of England.

;Part Two
In contrast to the straightforward documentary of the first part of the book, in part two Orwell discusses the relevance of socialism to improving living conditions. This section proved controversial.

Orwell sets out his initial premises very simply:
#Are the appalling conditions described in part one tolerable? (No)
#Is socialism &quot;wholeheartedly applied as a world system&quot; capable of improving those conditions? (Yes)
#Why then are we not all socialists?

The rest of the book consists of Orwell&#x27;s attempt to answer this difficult question. He points out that most people who argue against socialism do not do so because of straightforward selfish motives, or because they do not believe that the system would work, but for more complex emotional reasons, which (according to Orwell) most socialists misunderstand. He identifies five main problems:
#Class prejudice. This is real and it is visceral. Middle-class socialists do themselves no favours by pretending it does not exist andby glorifying the manual workerthey tend to alienate the large section of the population that is economically working-class but culturally middle-class.
#Machine worship. Orwell finds most socialists guilty of this. Orwell himself is suspicious of technological progress for its own sake and thinks it inevitably leads to softness and decadence. He points out that most fictional technically advanced socialist utopias are deadly dull. H. G. Wells in particular is criticised on these grounds.
#Crankiness. Among many other types of people Orwell specifies people who have beards or wear sandals, vegetarians, and nudists as contributing to socialism&#x27;s negative reputation among many more conventional people.
#Turgid language. Those who pepper their sentences with &quot;notwithstandings&quot; and &quot;heretofores&quot; and become over excited when discussing dialectical materialism are unlikely to gain much popular support.
#Failure to concentrate on the basics. Socialism should be about common decency and fair shares for all rather than political orthodoxy or philosophical consistency.

In presenting these arguments Orwell takes on the role of devil&#x27;s advocate. He states very plainly that he himself is in favour of socialism but feels it necessary to point out reasons why many people, who would benefit from socialism, and should logically support it, are in practice likely to be strong opponents.

Orwell&#x27;s publisher, Victor Gollancz, was so concerned that these passages would be misinterpreted, and that the (mostly middle-class) members of the Left Book Club would be offended, that he added a foreword in which he raises some caveats about Orwell&#x27;s claims in Part Two. He suggests, for instance, that Orwell may exaggerate the visceral contempt that the English middle classes hold for the working class, adding, however, that, &quot;I may be a bad judge of the question, for I am a Jew, and passed the years of my early boyhood in a fairly close Jewish community; and, among Jews of this type, class distinctions do not exist.&quot;

Other concerns Gollancz raises are that Orwell should so instinctively dismiss movements such as pacifism or feminism as incompatible with or counter-productive to the Socialist cause, and that Orwell relies too much upon a poorly defined, emotional concept of Socialism. Gollancz claims that Orwell &quot;does not once define what he &quot;means&quot; by Socialism&quot; in &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;. The foreword does not appear in some modern editions of the book, though it was included, for instance, in Harcourt Brace Jovanovich&#x27;s first American edition in the 1950s.

At a later date Gollancz published part one on its own, against Orwell&#x27;s wishes, and he refused to publish &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; at all.

==Book title==
Orwell was asked about Wigan Pier in a radio programme in December 1943. He replied: &quot;Well, I am afraid I must tell you that Wigan Pier doesn&#x27;t exist. I made a journey specially to see it in 1936 and I couldn&#x27;t find it. It did exist once, however, and to judge from the photographs it must have been about twenty feet long.&quot; The original &quot;pier&quot; at Wigan was a coal loading , probably a wooden jetty, where wagons of coal from a nearby colliery were unloaded into waiting barges on the canal. The original wooden pier is believed to have been demolished in 1929, with the iron from the tippler being sold as scrap.

Although a pier is a structure built out into the water from the shore, in Britain the term has the connotation of a seaside holiday. In the broadcast radio interview of 1943 Orwell elaborated on the name &quot;Wigan Pier&quot;: &quot;Wigan is in the middle of the mining areas. The landscape is mostly slag-heapsWigan has always been picked on as a symbol of the ugliness of the industrial areas. At one time, on one of the muddy little canals that run round the town, there used to be a tumble-down wooden jetty; and by way of a joke some nicknamed this Wigan Pier. The joke caught on locally, and then the music-hall comedians got hold of it, and they are the ones who have succeeded in keeping Wigan Pier alive as a byword.&quot;

Geographically, Wigan Pier is the name given today to the area around the canal at the bottom of the Wigan flight of locks on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

==Reviews and criticism==
The book was reviewed on 14 March 1937 by Edward Shanks, for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and by Hugh Massingham, for &quot;The Observer&quot;.

=== Initial response ===
In general, early reviewers of &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; praised Orwell&#x27;s depiction of the working class in Part I. The poet Edith Sitwell wrote: &quot;The horror of the beginning ... is unsurpassable. He seems to be doing for the modern world what Engels did for the world of 1840–50. But with this difference, that Orwell is a born writer, whereas Engels, fiery and splendid spirit though he was, simply wasn&#x27;t a writer.&quot; Responses to Part II, as the book transformed from reportage into a mix of politics, polemics, and selective autobiography, were more varied, ranging from praise to anger and indignation. Arthur Calder-Marshall&#x27;s 20 March 1937 review in &quot;Time and Tide&quot; celebrates Orwell&#x27;s achievement, and can be summarised by its first line: &quot;Of Mr Orwell&#x27;s book, there is little to say except praise.&quot;

This sentiment is shared in a review by Hamish Miles in &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot; on 1 May 1937. Miles writes that &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; &quot;is a living and lively book from start to finish. The honest Tory must face what he tells and implies, and the honest Socialist must face him, too.&quot; Douglas Goldring, writing in &quot;Fortnightly&quot; in April 1937, describes the book as &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot;, and like Miles highly recommends that both conservatives and socialists read it. In &quot;Tribune&quot; on 12 March 1937, Walter Greenwood calls Part I &quot;authentic and first rate&quot; but was more ambivalent towards Part II: &quot;[In Part II, Orwell] has you with him one moment and provoked beyond endurance the next ... I cannot remember having been so infuriated for a long time than by some of the things he says here.&quot;

H. J. Laski, a co-founder of the Left Book Club, wrote a review in March 1937 in &quot;Left News&quot; which repeats the main arguments of Gollancz&#x27;s preface. Laski claims that Part I is &quot;admirable propaganda for our ideas&quot; but that Part II falls short: &quot;But having, very ably, depicted a disease, Mr Orwell does what so many well-meaning people do: needing a remedy (he knows it is socialism), he offers an incantation instead. He thinks that an appeal to &#x27;liberty&#x27; and &#x27;justice&#x27; will, on the basis of facts such as he has described, bring people tumbling over one another into the Socialist Party. ... This view is based on fallacies so elementary that I should doubt the necessity of explaining them as fallacies were it not that there are so many people who share Mr Orwell&#x27;s view. Its basic error is the belief that we all mean the same things by liberty and justice. Most emphatically we do not.&quot;

In the April 1937 edition of the &quot;Left News&quot;, Gollancz reported that the book had produced &quot;both more, and more interesting, letters than any other Club Choice. The book has done, perhaps in a greater degree than any previous book, what the Club is meant to doit has provoked thought, and discussion of the keenest kind. While members with a training in scientific socialism have been surprised at the &quot;naïveté&quot; of the second part, they have found it valuable, as showing how much education they still have to do.&quot; Orwell biographers Stansky and Abrahams noted: &quot;But Gollancz and Laski, believing in a scientific rather than an emotional socialism, believing (in 1937) that it was still possible to equip people to fight against war and Fascism, were caught in a time warp: history was leaving them behind. Orwell in Spain was continuing his educationin a real war against Fascismand it was very different from anything envisioned by the selectors of the Left Book Club. What he was learning had less to do with scientific socialism than with the morality of politics, and it would change his life.&quot;

A radio play by David Pownall, &quot;Writing on Wigan Pier&quot;, with Adrian Scarborough as Orwell, was broadcast by BBC Radio Four in 2010.

=== Criticism ===
Communist Party of Great Britain leader Harry Pollitt, who was also an acquaintance of Orwell and a native of Lancashire where the book is set, gave a strongly negative review. Although Pollitt praised Orwell&#x27;s description of mining conditions and the indictment of housing in industrial centres, he believed that &quot;Road to Wigan Pier&quot; was a snobbish portrayal of working class life. 
Pollitt also attacked Orwell for judging people on their aesthetic, rather than whether they wanted to build a better world. 

According to Christopher Hitchens, the allegation of having said &quot;the working classes smell&quot; in &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; became a recurring criticism of Orwell from critics on the Left, despite it not being his personal sentiment. &quot;As his published correspondence shows, every time Orwell wrote anything objectionable to the Left, up would come this old charge again, having attained the mythic status that placed it beyond mere factual refutation.&quot; In the book, according to Hitchens, Orwell instead refers to it being &quot;middle-class people, such as his own immediate forebears, [that] were convinced that &#x27;the working classes smell&#x27;.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Tung Chien is a Vietnamese bureaucrat in a world that has been conquered by Chinese-style atheist communism, where the population is kept docile with hallucinogenic drugs. When a street vendor gives Tung an illegal anti-hallucinogen, he discovers that the Party leader has a horrible secret.

==Reception==
Algis Budrys said that &quot;the first three-quarters of (the) story appear to be very good&quot;, and that although &quot;Dick knows his hallucinogens very well&quot;, in &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot; &quot;he makes sense only to himself&quot;.

&quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot; was nominated for the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novelette.

<doc id="140731" wikidata="Q924525" url="?curid=140731" title="Snake handling in Christianity">
<text>Snake handling, also called serpent handling, is a religious rite observed in a small number of isolated churches, mostly in the United States, usually characterized as rural and part of the Holiness movement. The practice began in the early 20th century in Appalachia and plays only a small part in the church service. Participants are Holiness, or Pentecostals. The beliefs and practices of the movement have been documented in several films and have been the impetus for a number of state laws related to the handling of venomous animals.

== History ==
=== Early Christianity ===
==== Gnosticism ====
In the 2nd century the Ophites reportedly handled snakes during their services, and also worshipped the serpent.

==== Egyptian monasticism ====
The &quot;Sayings of the Desert Fathers&quot; detail an Egyptian monk named Paul, who was said to be able to hold snakes in his hand and cut them open. The account attributes this ability to a special grace from God.

=== American Christianity ===
The practice of snake handling first appeared in American Christianity around 1910 and was associated with the ministry of George Went Hensley of Grasshopper Valley in southeastern Tennessee. Hensley&#x27;s role in initiating the practice has been disputed by academic studies. Kimbrough notes that claims of Hensley being the originator of snake handling are usually found to be unsubstantiated by research, and the origins of the observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson similarly argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake-handling rituals cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions.

However, historians agree that Hensley&#x27;s advocacy, leadership, and particularly his personal charisma, were important factors in advancing the Pentecostal snake handling and spreading it throughout the southeast United States. Coverage of Hensley&#x27;s ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services. The media has focused on popular snake handlers such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers due to snakebite have received particular attention.

==== The Church of God with Signs Following ====
Hensley was a minister of the Church of God, now known as the Church of God (Cleveland), founded by Richard Spurling and A. J. Tomlinson. In 1922, Hensley resigned from the Church of God, citing &quot;trouble in the home&quot;; his resignation marked the zenith of the practice of snake handling in the denomination, with the Church of God disavowing the practice of snake handling during the 1920s.

In the 1930s, he traveled the Southeast resuming his ministry and promoting the practice. If believers truly had the Holy Spirit within them, Hensley argued, they should be able to handle rattlesnakes and any number of other venomous serpents. They should also be able to drink poison and suffer no harm whatsoever. Snake handling as a test or demonstration of faith became popular wherever Hensley traveled and preached in the small towns of Tennessee, Kentucky, the Carolinas, Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana. Sister-churches later sprang up throughout the Appalachian region. In 1943, Hensley and Ramond Hayes, a young adherent of Hensley&#x27;s teachings, started a church together in 1945, which they named the &quot;Dolly Pond Church of God with Signs Following&quot;. Snake-handling churches influenced by Hensley&#x27;s ministry are broadly known as the Church of God with Signs Following. In July 1955, Hensley died following a snakebite received during a service he was conducting in Altha, Florida.

==== The Church of Lord Jesus with Signs Following ====
Serpent-handling in north Alabama and north Georgia originated with James Miller in Sand Mountain, Alabama, at about the same time. Miller apparently developed his belief independently of any knowledge of Hensley&#x27;s ministry. Whereas Hensley&#x27;s ministry was trinitarian, the snake-handling churches influenced by Miller&#x27;s ministry are non-trinitarian, and are broadly known as the Church of Lord Jesus with Signs Following. This version dominates snake-handling churches north of the Appalachians.

== Prevalence ==
Each church body is independent and autonomous, and the denominational name is not consistent in all areas. However they are typically some variation of the name &quot;Church of God&quot; (Trinitarian) or &quot;Church of (Lord) Jesus&quot; (Oneness).

The exact membership is unknown, and has recently been estimated as low as 1,000 and as high as 5,000 with possibly fifty to a hundred congregations. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of American Religions&quot;, churches &quot;can be found from central Florida to West Virginia and as far west as Columbus, Ohio.&quot; The snake-handling sect of beliefs and practices go as far as to cross the border into Western Canada in 2004 to Lethbridge and Edmonton, Alberta.

Most religious snake handlers are still found in the Appalachian Mountains and other parts of the southeastern United States, especially in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. In 2001, about 40 small churches practiced snake handling, most of them considered to be Holiness, Pentecostals, or Charismatics. In 2004, there were four snake-handling congregations in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, Canada.

Ralph Hood, professor of social psychology and the psychology of religion at the University of Tennessee, who has studied the snake handling movement, indicated in 2003 that the practice is &quot;currently at a fairly low ebb of popularity&quot;. A 2013 article by NPR gave a figure of &quot;about 125&quot; churches where snakes are handled, but also indicated that &quot;snake handlers are notoriously private&quot;.

== Common doctrines ==

=== Biblical foundation and &quot;signs following&quot; ===
Practitioners believe serpent handling dates to antiquity and quote the Gospel of Mark (chapter 16) and the Gospel of Luke to support the practice:
Churches that practice snake handling and drinking poison as a demonstration of the strength of their faith during worship services frequently describe themselves with the phrase &quot;with sign following&quot;; this is based on a literal interpretation of the following biblical passage which they cite for biblical validation:
These passages are part of the longer ending of Mark which many biblical scholars regard as a later addition to the manuscript tradition and it is noted as such in many modern translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version. However, the longer ending is part of the received text and the canonical status of these passages is rarely disputed.

Another passage from the New Testament used to support snake handlers&#x27; beliefs is , which relates that Paul was bitten by a venomous viper and suffered no harm:
Only snake-handling churches interpret these passages as a call to handle serpents, while others dispute these interpretations.

=== Practices ===
As in the early days, worshipers are still encouraged to lay hands on the sick, speak in tongues, provide testimony of miracles, and occasionally consume poisons such as strychnine. Worship services usually include singing, praying, speaking in tongues, and preaching. The front of the church, behind the pulpit, is the designated area for handling snakes. Rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and copperheads (venomous snakes native to North America) are the most common, but even cobras have been used. During the service, believers may approach the front and pick up the snakes, usually raising them into the air and sometimes allowing the snakes to slither on their bodies. Handling the snakes is not compulsory for those attending services. Some believers will also engage in drinking poison (most commonly strychnine) at this time.

Although individual incidents may actually be understood in a variety of ways, those who die from snakebites are never criticized for lack of adequate faith; it is believed that it was simply the deceased&#x27;s time to die. Bitten believers usually do not seek medical help, but look to God for their healing. They fully believe that adherents need to handle the snakes as a demonstration of their having the Holy Spirit within. Darlene Summerford, when asked how it felt to handle venomous serpents, replied, &quot;It&#x27;s just knowing you got power over them snakes&quot;. 
And, if they get bitten by the snake, then they lack the true Spirit. Moreover, if they are bitten, then the congregation prays over them. If they die, then God intended for that to happen.

== Legal issues ==

=== Legality ===
All Appalachian states except West Virginia outlawed the snake-handling ritual when it first emerged. The states of Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee have passed laws against the use of venomous snakes or other reptiles that endangers the lives of others without a permit.

The Kentucky law specifically mentions religious services; in Kentucky snake handling is a misdemeanor and punishable by a $50 to $100 fine.

Snake handling is legal in the state of West Virginia, as the current state constitution does not allow any law to impede upon nor promote a religious practice.

Snake handling was made a felony punishable by death under Georgia law in 1941, following the death of a seven-year-old from a rattlesnake bite. However, the punishment was so severe that juries would refuse to convict, and the law was repealed in 1968.

The American Civil Liberties Union has defended the religious freedom of snake handlers against various attempts to have the practice banned.

=== Manslaughter and murder ===
In 1992, Glenn Summerford, a serpent-handling preacher, was convicted of attempted murder of his wife with a rattlesnake, by forcing her to be bitten on two occasions, at their home. During the trial, some members of the congregation sided with Glenn Summerford, and others with his wife, Darlene. Each Summerford accused the other of infidelity, and &quot;backsliding&quot; from their faith by drinking alcohol. Dennis Covington, a journalist who covered the Summerford trial discusses his first-hand, investigative experiences at a snake-handling church in Appalachia, in his book, &quot;Salvation on Sand Mountain&quot;.

=== Possession and transportation of venomous snakes ===
In July 2008, ten people were arrested and 125 venomous snakes were confiscated as part of an undercover sting operation titled &quot;Twice Shy&quot;. Pastor Gregory James Coots of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus&#x27; Name (FGTJN) in Middlesboro, Kentucky, was arrested and 74 snakes seized from his home as part of the sting.

Jamie Coots (son of Gregory Coots) was cited in 2013 for illegal possession and transportation of venomous snakes when three rattlesnakes and two copperheads were discovered in his vehicle during a vehicle check in Knoxville, Tennessee. Later in 2013, Coots published an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; making an argument for U.S. Constitutional protection regarding religious freedom, especially freedom to practice the unique variety of religion found in snake-handling churches. Coots died on 15 February 2014 from a snakebite.

Andrew Hamblin, who appeared alongside Jamie Coots in &quot;Snake Salvation&quot;, was cited for having dangerous wildlife in 2014, but a grand jury declined to indict him.

== Risks ==
The handling of venomous snakes has significant risks. Ralph Hood observes, &quot;If you go to any serpent-handling church, you&#x27;ll see people with atrophied hands, and missing fingers. All the serpent-handling families have suffered such things&quot;. Jamie Coots, a pastor who subsequently died from a snakebite, said, &quot;Handlers get bitten all the time, and every few years someone dies&quot;.

Various figures for the total number of deaths from snakebite during religious services have been proposed:
* &quot;over 100 documented deaths&quot; (2003) by Ralph Hood.
* &quot;around 120&quot; (2005) by Robert Winston.
* &quot;about 100 deaths&quot; (2013) by Julia Duin, a journalist who has covered snake handling churches and is writing a book on the subject.
* &quot;91 documented snake bite deaths&quot; (2015) by Paul Williamson, professor of psychology at Henderson State University and co-author of books with Ralph Hood.
* &quot;105 cases that were found in literature.&quot;(2015) by Amy Waters.
Another source indicates that 35 people died between 1936 and 1973.

Hood also notes that the practice does not present a danger to observers. There is no documented case of a non-handling member being bitten by a serpent handled by another believer.

== Media coverage ==

A number of films and television programs have been made about religious snake handling.

* &quot;Holy Ghost People&quot; is a 1967 documentary by Peter Adair. It is about the service of a snake handling Pentecostal community in Scrabble Creek, West Virginia, United States. This documentary has entered the public domain and is available at the Internet Archive.
* &quot;Heaven Come Down&quot; is a 2006 television documentary film about some unusual worship practices of some Pentecostal Christians in Appalachia, including snake handling.
* &quot;Snake Salvation&quot; is a 2013 series produced by the National Geographic Channel, comprising 16 episodes in a reality television format. The show featured two modern snake-handling pastors and their congregations. The show&#x27;s focus was on Jamie Coots, who subsequently died of a snakebite. The other featured pastor was Andrew Hamblin, pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, Tennessee. Hamblin, a protégé of Coots, was worshiping at his mentor&#x27;s church alongside Coots when the fatal snake bite occurred in February 2014.
*&quot;Them That Follow&quot; is a Sundance Film Nominee about a small Church and community that practices this religion. The film stars Walton Goggins.
*&quot;Alabama Snake&quot; is a 2020 HBO documentary which focuses on the 1991 attempted murder of Darlene Summerford by her husband, snake handling pastor Glenn Summerford.

<text>The second Battle of Nördlingen (or Battle of Allerheim) was fought on 3 August 1645 southeast of Nördlingen near the village of Alerheim. France and its Protestant German allies defeated the forces of the Holy Roman Empire and its Bavarian ally.

==Prelude==
The Imperials and their main German ally Bavaria were facing increasingly severe pressure in the war from the French, Swedes and their Protestant allies and were struggling to prevent a French attempt to advance into Bavaria.

===Geography===
The 16,000-man Imperial-Bavarian army, led by Field Marshal Franz Baron von Mercy and Johann von Werth entrenched on rising ground near the village of Alerheim, 10 km southeast of Nordlingen. One km to the northeast of the village, the ridge rises to a height called the Wennenberg. Exactly 1 km to the southwest of the village is the Schloss Alerheim, which crowns a hill. Mercy and Werth deployed their right wing on the Wennenberg, anchored their left wing on the &quot;schloss&quot; (castle) hill, and posted their center on the low ridge between the wings. In the 17th century, Alerheim was smaller and entirely to the northwest of the Imperial battleline between the Wennenberg and the &quot;schloss&quot;. To protect their weak center, the Bavarian and Imperial officers had some dismounted dragoons and foot soldiers barricade themselves in the village. They hoped to defeat the French by forcing them into a disadvantageous attack uphill into the fire of the Imperial cannon.

==Battle==
Before the battle, Marshal Henri, Vicomte de Turenne united his Franco-German army with an all-French army led by the Duc d&#x27;Enghien (who succeeded as the Prince de Condé from 1646 onward) and 6,000 Hessians commanded by Johann von Geyso. The combined army of 17,000 men was placed under Enghien&#x27;s overall leadership. Enghien&#x27;s tactics were brutally simple. He intended to launch the French troops in a frontal charge on the Imperial positions. Meanwhile, it took the French army from noon until 4:00 pm to arrange its lines for battle.

In the event, the Imperial army counterattacked almost at once. Charging downhill from Schloss Alerheim, they broke Enghien&#x27;s hesitant right wing, forcing the Frenchman to call off his attack on the Imperial center. On the other end of the field, Turenne hammered at the Wennenberg. When the Wennenberg fell, the defeated Imperial right swung back and the victorious left wheeled forward, so that the Imperials faced north instead of northwest. Mercy was killed during the savage fighting. By evening, both armies were still on the field of battle. However, in the darkness and confusion, the Imperials in the village, believing themselves to be surrounded, capitulated. Later that night, the Imperial army conceded defeat and withdrew to Donauwörth.

==Result==
The Franco-German losses were 4,000 killed, wounded, and captured, including the capture of Marshal Gramont and the death of 3 colonels, along with 70 flags. The Bavarian-Imperial army suffered similar losses. The French were able to subsequently capture the cities of Nördlingen and Dinkelsbühl but Enghien fell sick while sieging Heilbronn. Turenne was left in command and abandoned the siege in front of the numerical superior Imperial-Bavarian army that gained reinforcements from Bohemia by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. The French Marshal eventually fell back to Philippsburg. Therefore, the only French gain from the bloody victory was their capture of Nördlingen and Dinkelsbühl. Bavaria was at least temporarily safe. Eventually the battle provided no more than a breathing space and did not prevent the invasion of Bavaria the following year.
In 2008 archaeologists dug up a mass grave of 50 skeletons, most-likely French soldiers, just outside the town of Alerheim.

<text>Fertility rites or fertility cult are religious rituals that are intended to stimulate reproduction in humans or in the natural world. Such rites may involve the sacrifice of &quot;a primal animal, which must be sacrificed in the cause of fertility or even creation&quot;.

==Characteristics==

&quot;Fertility rites may occur in calendric cycles, as rites of passage within the life cycle, or as ad hoc rituals...Commonly fertility rituals are embedded within larger-order religions or other social institutions.&quot;

As with cave pictures &quot;[that] show animals at the point of mating...[and] served magic fertility rites&quot;, such rites are &quot;...a form of sympathetic magic&quot; in which the forces of nature are to be influenced by the example acted out in the ritual. At times, &quot;ceremonies intended to assure the fecundity of the earth or of a group of women...involve some form of phallic worship&quot;.

==Geographical varieties==

===Ancient Greece===

Central to fertility rites in classical Greece was &quot;Demeter, goddess of fertility... Her rites celebrated the procession of the seasons, the mystery of the plants and the fruits in their annual cycle of coming to be and passing away.&quot; But most &quot;women&#x27;s festivals... related in some way to woman&#x27;s proper function as a fertile being (which allowed her to promote the fertility of crops too, by sympathy)&quot;.

Because of his link to the grape harvest, however, &quot;it is not surprising to see Dionysus associated with Demeter and Kore in the Eleusinian Mysteries. For he, too, represented one of the great life-bringing forces of the world.&quot;

===Phoenicia===

Ancient Phoenicia saw &quot;a special sacrifice at the season of the harvest, to reawaken the spirit of the vine&quot;; while the winter fertility rite to restore &quot;the spirit of the withering vine&quot; included as sacrifice &quot;cooking a kid in the milk of its mother, a Canaanite custom which Mosaic law condemned and formally forbade&quot;.

The death of Adonis – &quot;a vegetation spirit who...was manifest in the seed of corn&quot; – was marked by &quot;the most beautiful of Phoenician festivals...celebrated immediately after the harvest&quot;.

===Australia===

Durkheim explored Australian ceremonies &quot;to assure the prosperity of the animal or vegetable species serving the clan as totem&quot;. Such ceremonies took the form both of &quot;oblations, whether bloody or otherwise&quot;, and of &quot;rites which...consist in movements and cries whose object is to imitate the different aspects and attitudes of the animal whose reproduction is desired&quot;.

Durkheim concluded that &quot;as the rites, and especially those which are periodical, demand nothing more of nature than that it follow its ordinary course, it is not surprising that it should generally have the air of obeying them&quot;.

===Christian===
In the parables of Jesus Christ, such as the Parable of the Sower, &quot;the sower sows the word,&quot; where the seed is the word of God. The parables of the mustard seed and the growing seed explain the kingdom of God in which growth is due to God and not to man and follows its own schedule . In John 12:24 the death and resurrection of Jesus compared to the core, which falls to the ground and dies and then produces a lot of seeds. In many Christian traditions, Easter service at dawn, or the service of the Resurrection, is held in the Acre of God, where the bodies of the dead are &quot;sown as a seed&quot;.

Many fertility rites that have spiritual origins such as European Christians and Pagans drew their methods from &quot;myths, imagery, and ritual practices from the religions&quot;. Agricultural practices role in transforming “the wild” into habitable places were prevalent in (western). Alongside education and medicine, agriculture helped spread western power and influence through Christian missions.

===Arabia===
Some authors believe that fertility rites took place around the Kaaba in pre-Islamic times. During the autumn pilgrimage to the Kaaba, rituals performed there included performing the circumambulation naked, holding vigil in front of Mount Arafat, giving offerings to the pillars at al-Mina, and offering sacrifices. According to Barnaby Rogerson, it is likely these rituals were a part of a fertility cult, ensuring continuation of the life-cycle. In the cult, a mother goddess represented by a trinity was worshiped, along with a heroic young god would die and be reborn in an unending cycle due to his father, the supreme god. This was symbolized by agriculture and movement of the celestial bodies in Arabia. Allat was the fertility goddess with al-Rabba (the sovereign), Manat and Al-Uzza being her epithets. Thuraiza or Muzdalifah was the heroic young god and Allah was the father. Benjamin Walker says the Kaaba was honored by orgies and that its name means &quot;virgin&quot;. Fertility rites took place in the temples of the Great Goddess and the color green was associated with her.

===Islamic traditions===

It is believed in some Islamic traditions that a tree transfers its blessings (&quot;barakah&quot;) and thus trees were planted on graves. The custom of beating people with twigs is derived from an old fertility rite, with the tree transferring its life force. This practice was performed in medieval Egypt, particularly in Cairo by a jester called the &quot;&#x27;Ifrit al-mahmal&quot;, when the mahmal carrying the covering of the Kaaba was exhibited. A similar practice also happens in the Deccan region of India during Muharram. Pilgrims to Mecca and tombs of saints are also garlanded since it is believed they preserve the life force of a tree.

=== Mesoamerica ===
Agricultural fertility was and continues to be of primary concern for Mesoamerican cultures. Many ritual activities performed by Indigenous communities in Mesoamerica were directed to deities of land and rain, as their understanding of fertility was intimately related to specific geographical attributes, such as bodies of water, mountains, and caves. In Mesoamerican worldview, agricultural success was believed to be directly related to survival and prosperity. For this reason, ceremonies and religious rites offered to rain and earth deities were an integral part of most aspects of their socioreligious organization. Archaeological evidence throughout Mesoamerica attests to the magnanimous importance of fertility rituals for the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec civilizations.

==Contemporary analogues==

* It has been suggested that &quot;at the heart of the myth of science lie fertility rites which ensure the continued fruitfulness of technological innovation&quot;.
* Eric Berne points out that &quot;the Adult &#x27;helpnik&#x27; vocabularies (PTA, psychology, psychoanalysis, social science) may be used in an intellectual Rite of Spring, where the victim&#x27;s dismembered psyche is left scattered over the floor on the theory that he will eventually join himself together and be more fertile afterwards&quot;.
*Modern wedding ritual is seen by Freud as a kind of ritual orgy.

==Literature: T. S. Eliot==

In &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, &quot;Eliot waxes nostalgic for a classical society founded upon ritual praxis...fertility rites in which the participants mime the fall and return of natural cycles&quot; – &quot;Keeping time, Keeping their rhythm in their dancing As in their living in the living seasons&quot;, as he would subsequently put it.

<text>The Bertelsmann SE &amp; Co. KGaA, commonly known as Bertelsmann (), is a German private multinational conglomerate corporation based in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest media conglomerates and is also active in the service sector and education.

Bertelsmann was founded as a publishing house by Carl Bertelsmann in 1835. After World War II, Bertelsmann, under the leadership of Reinhard Mohn, went from being a medium-sized enterprise to a major conglomerate, offering not only books but also television, radio, music, magazines and services. Its principal divisions include the RTL Group, Penguin Random House, BMG, Arvato, the Bertelsmann Printing Group, the Bertelsmann Education Group and Bertelsmann Investments.

Bertelsmann is an unlisted and capital market-oriented company, which remains primarily controlled by the Mohn family.

== History ==

=== 1835–1933 ===
The nucleus of the corporation is the &quot;C. Bertelsmann Verlag&quot;, a publishing house established on 1 July 1835 by Carl Bertelsmann in Gütersloh. Carl Bertelsmann was a representative of the &quot;Minden-Ravensberger Erweckungsbewegung&quot;, a Protestant revival movement, whose writings he published. The C. Bertelsmann Verlag, originally specialized in theological literature, expanded its publications to include school and textbooks and in the 1920s and 1930s increasingly entered into the field of light fiction.

=== 1933–1945 ===
In Nazi Germany, the publishing house gained a prominent position with its affordable &quot;Bertelsmann Volksausgaben&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s editions&quot;). In particular, war adventure books such as Werner von Langsdorff&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerbuch&quot; on aviation were a commercial success. Heinrich Mohn belonged to the patrons&#x27; circle of the &quot;SS&quot; and sought to turn his company into a National Socialist model enterprise. During World War II, the C. Bertelsmann Verlag became a leading supplier to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, even surpassing Franz Eher, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party. Especially in the years between 1939 and 1941, the revenues of the C. Bertelsmann Verlag skyrocketed. Jewish slave laborers were not forced to work in Gütersloh, but in printing plants in Lithuania with which the C. Bertelsmann Verlag cooperated. In 1944, the &quot;Reichsschrifttumskammer&quot; (Reich Chamber of Literature) closed the publishing house to &quot;mobilize all powers for victory&quot;. Another essential reason for this was criminal paper racketeering by some publisher&#x27;s employees, which led to a trial in 1944.

=== 1945–1970 ===
After World War II, the company portrayed itself to the Allied Control Authority as a Christian publisher that was part of the resistance to Nazism and allegedly persecuted. Ties to National Socialist organizations were initially denied. After it became known that erroneous, or at least inadequate, statements had been made, Heinrich Mohn stepped down as the head of the publishing house. Reinhard Mohn, one of his three sons, took over the C. Bertelsmann Verlag, as Hans Heinrich Mohn had been killed in the war and Sigbert Mohn was still a prisoner of war. In 1947, the Allies finally granted the company a publishing license. After currency reform in 1948, there was a market slump in the book trade that also led to the next existential crisis for the C. Bertelsmann Verlag. Under these conditions, in 1950 Bertelsmann launched the Lesering (book club) to stimulate sales. Customers ordered books via subscription and in return received discounted prices. The business increasingly shifted from the publishing house to the sale of books, which was decisive to further growth.

In 1959, the C. Bertelsmann Verlag underwent a restructuring. From that point forward, theological literature was published by the newly established Gütersloher Verlagshaus, which was consolidated with the Rufer Verlag. Fiction, poetry, and art publications were placed under the Sigbert Mohn Verlag. The C. Bertelsmann Verlag focused on nonfiction books, in particular dictionaries, guidebooks, reference books and journals. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bertelsmann expanded its activities into new business areas. In 1956, the company entered the music market with the Bertelsmann Schallplattenring (record club). Two years later, Ariola, one of the most successful German record labels was launched, and virtually at the same time, the Sonopress record pressing plant was established. With the &quot;Kommissionshaus Buch &amp; Ton&quot; (book and audio commissioning company), from which the &quot;Vereinigte Verlagsauslieferung&quot; (VVA) emerged, Bertelsmann laid the cornerstone for its service business. In 1964, Bertelsmann purchased the already broken-up UFA from the Deutsche Bank and built on its presence in cinema and television. In 1969, Bertelsmann acquired shares in the magazine publisher Gruner + Jahr. A merger with Axel Springer, also planned at the time, for which a loan for millions had been taken out temporarily from Westdeutsche Landesbank, failed in 1970.

=== 1971–1983 ===
Starting in 1971, Bertelsmann operated as a joint-stock company (&quot;&quot; or &quot;AG&quot;), renamed Bertelsmann AG. The increasingly diversifying book publishers were bundled in the &quot;Verlagsgruppe Bertelsmann&quot; publishing group at the end of the 1960s. In 1972, this company moved from Gütersloh to Munich. Key divisions remained in Gütersloh, for which a new office building was built in 1976 at the group&#x27;s official location. To this day, it has remained the Bertelsmann headquarters, referred to as the &quot;Bertelsmann Corporate Center&quot;. The rapid growth of Bertelsmann led to structural and financial problems. In the 1970s, financing requirements reached their peak. From 1975 to 1980, for example, the return on sales fell below one percent. Bertelsmann also encountered new regulatory rules in its home market, in particular through laws governing mergers. Larger acquisitions became practically impossible. At the same time, there was an increasing saturation of the German market for the Bertelsmann Lesering, whereas the foreign book clubs earned the lion&#x27;s share of revenues in this corporate division.

The internationalization of Bertelsmann, initiated in the 1960s, was taken further: Among other things, Bertelsmann acquired shares in the publishing houses Plaza &amp; Janés based in Barcelona and Bantam Books from New York City. In the United States, a location was established for Ariola and, in 1979, Arista Records was acquired from Columbia Pictures. In the period of the 1979–1980 recession, there was discussion concerning the succession of Reinhard Mohn. In 1981, he finally moved over to the supervisory board. Dr. Juergen Kraemer, former Finance Minister of West Germany, who had previously headed up management of Gruner + Jahr, became the new chairman and chief executive officer. With this move, Bertelsmann, for the first time, was led by a manager who was not a member of the owner family. Mark Wössner became Fischer&#x27;s successor as chairman and chief executive officer of Bertelsmann in 1983. The affair concerning the forged Hitler diaries occurred at the beginning of his tenure, which damaged the reputation of Gruner + Jahr and Bertelsmann as a whole.

=== 1984–1993 ===
Mark Wössner brought the subsidiaries closer to headquarters in Gütersloh. In particular, this involved business development and controlling. Under the leadership of Mark Wössner, Bertelsmann also took a stake in RTL plus, the first private TV broadcaster in Germany. In 1986, Bertelsmann acquired a majority in RCA Records and merged its activities in the music market with the new Bertelsmann Music Group. Sonopress, a company established in 1958 to manufacture records, was not part of the Bertelsmann Music Group, rather it was assigned to the print and industrial division. With Doubleday, another well-known publishing house was acquired. As a result, the group ascended to become a well-known international company, and Bertelsmann was temporarily the world&#x27;s largest media group.

In the financial year of 1990/1991, Bertelsmann had over 45,000 employees and reached sales of 14.5 billion Deutsche Mark annually. 63% involved business outside of Germany, and the United States was the most important foreign market. After the German reunification and the end of the Cold War, Bertelsmann also expanded to East Germany, as well as into Central and Eastern Europe. For example, in 1989 the first branch outlet of the &quot;Club Bertelsmann&quot; opened in Dresden. The later development of Bertelsmann in the 1990s was marked by the spread of the Internet as a mass medium, as well as changes to the ownership structure. In 1993, Reinhard Mohn transferred the majority of capital shares to the Bertelsmann Stiftung and assumed its chairmanship. The foundation itself was financed by profits of the company.

=== 1994–2000 ===
In 1994, Gruner + Jahr acquired the magazines of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, whereby Bertelsmann was once again able to expand its presence in foreign markets. From 1995, there was a new business division of multimedia at Bertelsmann. Its centerpiece was AOL Europe, a joint venture of America Online and Bertelsmann. Prior to that, Bertelsmann had already acquired a direct share in America Online. The multimedia division also included &quot;mediaWays&quot; and &quot;Pixelpark&quot;. In 1997, UFA merged with &quot;Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion&quot; (CLT) to become a joint entertainment group based in Luxembourg. With CLT-UFA, Bertelsmann was able to decisively diversify its business. In 1998, Thomas Middelhoff succeeded Mark Wössner as Bertelsmann&#x27;s chairman and chief executive officer. Thomas Middelhoff had previously already been a member of the management board of the multimedia division. Mark Wössner joined the supervisory board of the company and also became chairman of the Bertelsmann Stiftung. In March 1998, Bertelsmann sold its video game publisher, BMG Interactive, to Take-Two Interactive in exchange for 16 percent of Take Two&#x27;s stock.

This management change coincided with the takeover of Random House. With this, the group advanced to become the largest publishing group in the English-speaking world. Random House was merged with &quot;Bantam Doubleday Dell&quot;, and the global headquarters of all Bertelsmann publishing houses were relocated to New York City. In 1999, Bertelsmann acquired the publisher Springer Science+Business Media, which, among other things, was the market leader for mathematics and physics. In the year 2000, Bertelsmann dissolved its joint venture with AOL Europe. The sale of the shares in the joint venture to America Online yielded billions to Bertelsmann. In the same year, Bertelsmann and Pearson formed the RTL Group from their TV subsidiaries. Bertelsmann initially owned a minority in the company, and gradually built up its share. Later, Bertelsmann secured the majority of the shares in RTL through a share swap with the Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), which as a result owned 25.1% of Bertelsmann.

=== 2001–2007 ===
Under the leadership of Thomas Middelhoff, Bertelsmann increased its involvement in the Internet, whereby above all the investment in Napster received major media attention. The aim of the acquisition, among other things, was to stem the illegal spread of copyrighted material. In 2001, the service nonetheless had to be shut down due to legal disputes. Bertelsmann faced several claims for damages by the music industry. In order to finance additional growth of Bertelsmann, Thomas Middelhoff raised the idea of going public, which led to fundamental disagreement with the Mohn family. In 2002, Gunter Thielen became the new chairman and chief executive officer of Bertelsmann, and some members of the media viewed the change critically.

A consolidation phase followed, in order to solve the problems with the core business. For example, Bertelsmann sold unprofitable e-commerce firms like the online shop of Barnes &amp; Noble, among others. Gruner + Jahr sold the Berliner Zeitung, and the scientific publisher, &quot;BertelsmannSpringer&quot;, was spun off. In the 2003 financial year, Bertelsmann announced that it was investing its music business in a joint venture with Sony. Bertelsmann and Sony each owned half the shares. With this transaction, the stakeholders sought to respond to declining sales in the music market. In addition, Gunter Thielen initiated the buyback of the shares from Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, so that the Mohn family regained complete control of Bertelsmann from 2006. This measure was also financed with the sale of the music publishing business to Vivendi&#x27;s Universal Music Publishing Group. During the tenure of Gunter Thielen, the number of employees at Bertelsmann exceeded 100,000 for the first time.

=== 2008–2015 ===
In 2008, Hartmut Ostrowski was appointed chairman and chief executive officer. Bertelsmann sold its shares of the record label Sony BMG, and since then the company has operated under the name of &quot;Sony Music Entertainment&quot;. In 2008, Bertelsmann acquired the rights to the Brockhaus Encyclopedia, and from that time on, this reference work was published by the &quot;Wissen Media Verlag&quot;. At the end of 2011, Hartmut Ostrowski suddenly announced that he was leaving Bertelsmann for unspecified personal reasons. In 2012, Bertelsmann went from being an AG to its current incorporation as a partnership limited by shares (&quot;Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien&quot; or &quot;KGaA&quot;), with the general partner being a European stock corporation (&quot;Societas Europaea&quot; or &quot;SE&quot;). Also, since 2012, Thomas Rabe has been chairman and chief executive officer of Bertelsmann.

In 2013, Bertelsmann floated part of its shares in the RTL Group on the stock exchange, in order to finance additional growth from the proceeds of the sale. In the year 2013, Penguin Random House became the world&#x27;s largest publishing company. Gruner + Jahr was taken over completely by Bertelsmann in 2014. Furthermore, under the leadership of Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann increasingly invested in the education sector: In 2014, for example, &quot;Relias Learning&quot; was acquired. The company belongs to the &quot;Bertelsmann Education Group&quot;, established in 2015. The Club Bertelsmann was wound up, and individual distribution partners are taking legal action against it. In 2016, the printing business was bundled in the &quot;Bertelsmann Printing Group&quot;.

=== 2016–present ===
Bertelsmann diversified its base in 2016 by introducing a structure consisting of eight divisions. In 2017, Bertelsmann also undertook moves to further strengthen its core business, among other things increasing its share in Penguin Random House from 53 to 75 percent. Through the partial withdrawal of Pearson, Bertelsmann secured a strategic three-quarters majority in the world&#x27;s leading trade publishing group. Penguin Random House&#x27;s publications include the memoirs of Michelle and Barack Obama.

Arvato was aligned more closely with the Group through changes in management, among other measures. The heads of the division&#x27;s individual &quot;Solution Groups&quot; have reported directly to members of the Bertelsmann Executive Board ever since. The company weighed its strategic options for the Customer Relationship Management business, and in 2018 established a CRM company in cooperation with the Saham Group: The new company, Majorel, enjoys a leading market position in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The growing education business was strengthened in 2018 through the acquisition of the U.S. provider OnCourse Learning, one of the Group&#x27;s biggest deals in the U.S. market. OnCourse Learning offers continuing education and professional development by providing digital courses for healthcare and financial services clients. Bertelsmann, itself a strong advocate of lifelong learning, donated tens of thousands of Udacity scholarships in 2017 and 2019 to enable the advanced training of talented participants, in fields including Big Data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

Bertelsmann has promoted stronger cooperation among its corporate divisions and has also opened up towards collaboration with other media houses. One such example is the Ad Alliance, launched in 2017, in which Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland and Gruner + Jahr bundled the marketing of their advertising platforms. The marketing arms of the Spiegel publishing house, Axel Springer, and Funke Mediengruppe have since joined the Ad Alliance as well; its portfolio reaches over 99 percent of the German population.

In 2019, Bertelsmann also boosted cooperation in the German content market by establishing the Content Alliance, headed up by Julia Jäkel. The key players in this initiative involve the television and radio broadcasting networks of the Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, UFA TV production company, Random House publishing company, Gruner + Jahr, as well as the BMG music company. The Bertelsmann Content Alliance develops joint formats and delivers a full range of products and services for creative professionals.

On 25 November 2020, it was reported that Bertelsmann will acquire the American publisher Simon &amp; Schuster from ViacomCBS for more than $2 billion. On 14 December 2020, Bertelsmann entered talks to sell the French magazine publisher Prisma Media, a division of Gruner + Jahr, to Vivendi. The sale was completed on 31 May 2021.

On 29 January 2021, Bertelsmann began to explore selling its controlling stake in the French television channel M6.

== Divisions ==
Bertelsmann is a decentralized organization. This means that the divisions largely work independently. The holding handles central tasks, in the field of corporate finance, for example. In 2016, Bertelsmann introduced a new structure of eight divisions: RTL Group (television and radio), Penguin Random House (book publishing), BMG (music rights), Arvato (services), Bertelsmann Education Group (education), Bertelsmann Printing Group (printing) and Bertelsmann Investments (investments).

=== RTL Group ===


RTL Group is a leading European entertainment provider, based in Luxembourg. The company runs a commercial private television and radio channels in several countries, including RTL and VOX in Germany. In 2015, with the &quot;RTL Digital Hub&quot;, the company launched a dedicated unit for web videos. In addition, production companies, such as Fremantle, are part of the RTL Group. In January 1997, Bertelsmann merged the UFA film and television company with Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion (CLT). The merger of CLT-UFA with &quot;Pearson TV&quot; in the year 2000 marked the beginning of the RTL Group. The company is listed on the stock exchange and has been majority-owned by Bertelsmann since 2001. Following the sale of shares in 2013, the stake is 75.1%. In 2022, sales of the RTL Group were €7.2 billion.

=== Penguin Random House ===


Penguin Random House is the world&#x27;s largest book publishing company. The company was created in 2013 through the merger of the publishing businesses of Bertelsmann and Pearson. With the acquisition of Random House in 1998, Bertelsmann already became the largest book publisher in the English-speaking world. 250 publishing houses on five continents are part of the company, including Random House and Penguin Books, but also Doubleday, Knopf and Viking. The German &quot;Verlagsgruppe Random House&quot; (Goldmann, Heyne and others), based in Munich, is not part of Penguin Random House, yet it does belong to the same division at Bertelsmann. Penguin Random House has its main headquarters in the Penguin Random House Tower in New York City. Since 2020, Bertelsmann owns 100% of the company. In 2022, the company achieved sales of €4.2 billion.

=== BMG ===


BMG is a music publishing company based in Berlin. The BMG catalog encompasses rights to works by artists such as Céline Dion, Jennifer Lopez, Ronan Keating and Britney Spears. In 2008, the company was created after the group divested from the music market. Following the sale of Sony BMG, Bertelsmann had retained the rights to 200, mainly European, artists. In 2009, KKR came on board with BMG, retaining a 51% majority in the company, and Bertelsmann held 49%. Since 2013, BMG has once again become a fully owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann. In 2016, BMG became a division of Bertelsmann. In 2022, BMG had revenues of €866 million.

=== Arvato ===


Arvato is an international service provider. In its current form, the company originated in the year 1999. At that time, the print and industry sectors at Bertelsmann were restructured, whereby services received a higher priority than the print and machinery sector. Since the 1950s, Bertelsmann has been an active service provider, delivering books for other publishing companies, for example. To this day, &quot;Vereinigte Verlagsauslieferung&quot; (VVA) has belonged to Arvato. Arvato also offers services in the areas of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM) and finance, as well as information technology. The main headquarters of Arvato is Gütersloh, and additional locations exist in 22 countries. In 2022, sales of Arvato reached a volume of €5.6 billion.

=== Bertelsmann Printing Group ===


In January 2016, Bertelsmann bundled its printing activities in digital, offset and gravure in the &quot;Bertelsmann Printing Group&quot;. It is Europe&#x27;s largest player in the industry. The corporate group is located in Gütersloh. Bertelsmann Printing Group includes not only GGP Media, Mohn Media, Prinovis, Sonopress, Vogel Druck and several other companies, but also &quot;Be Printers&quot;. Be Printers is in turn a spin-off of Arvato, created in 2012, in order to consolidate the group&#x27;s printing business. The business has been under pressure for years due to declining print editions. In 2022, the Bertelsmann Printing Group achieved sales of €1.4 billion.

=== Bertelsmann Education Group ===
The Bertelsmann Education Group is dedicated to the education sector. It was established in 2015 and has its headquarters in New York City. It includes, for example, the Alliant International University and Relias Learning. The acquisition of Relias Learning in 2014 formed the cornerstone for the Bertelsmann Education Group and was the largest acquisition by Bertelsmann since the purchase of Random House. In 2016, Relias acquired AHC Media, which was renamed Relias Media. In 2022, the Bertelsmann Education Group generated sales of €622 million.

=== Bertelsmann Investments ===
The Bertelsmann Investments division bundles Bertelsmann&#x27;s startup investments. &quot;Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments&quot; is based in Gütersloh and since 2014 has concentrated mainly on the United States. With &quot;Bertelsmann Asia Investments&quot;, &quot;Bertelsmann Brazil Investments&quot; and &quot;Bertelsmann India Investments&quot;, three additional funds exist that are active in the growth regions defined by the holding. Bertelsmann Investments holds equity positions in a total of over 100 startup companies, almost all from the digital economy. In 2022, sales reached €535 million.

== Ownership ==
From 1971 to 2012, Bertelsmann was a joint stock company under German law (). Subsequently, the company was transformed into a partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien). The general partner is a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea). Bertelsmann&#x27;s rationale for this move, among others, was the aim of opening up for investors, thus enabling them to participate in the financing of additional growth. The media commented the change of the legal structure &quot;the turn of an era&quot;, as it essentially also enables the company to go public. This move was not ultimately implemented, however. Today, Bertelsmann is a company active in capital markets, issuing bonds, for example. Since 2001, the company has prepared its financial statements according to International Financial Reporting Standards.

The new legal entity does not change any of the ownership of Bertelsmann. As early as the 1970s and 1980s, the Mohn family built up the Bertelsmann Stiftung, which has owned the majority of shares in Bertelsmann since 1993. In addition to social responsibility, tax considerations played a role in this. Moreover, this strategy was intended to preserve the continuity of the company. Today, according to Bertelsmann, the Mohn family holds 19.1% of the shares. The three foundations, Bertelsmann Stiftung, Reinhard Mohn Stiftung and BVG Stiftung, together own 80.9%. The &quot;Bertelsmann Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH&quot; (BVG) has key influence on the whole group: It bundles all the voting rights of the Mohn family and foundations with ownership shares. Together, they own 100 percent in the general assemblies of the group company (Bertelsmann SE &amp; Co. KGaA) and its general partner (Bertelsmann Management SE).

Bertelsmann SE &amp; Co. KGaA is managed by the Bertelsmann Management SE. The chairman of the executive board of Bertelsmann Management SE is Thomas Rabe. Other members of the executive board include Markus Dohle, Immanuel Hermreck, Bernd Hirsch and Anke Schäferkordt. In 2012, Bertelsmann created the additional so-called &quot;Group Management Committee&quot;, in order to advise the executive board in important matters. Some members of the media noted that a relatively large number of women have been appointed to the Group Management Committee. Bertelsmann SE &amp; Co. KGaA and Bertelsmann Management SE each have a supervisory board that oversees the management. In 2013, Christoph Mohn assumed the chairmanship of both bodies. From the family, Liz Mohn and Brigitte Mohn are also members of the supervisory boards of both companies.

== Locations ==
Since the 1970s, the Bertelsmann headquarters have been in the Gütersloh district of Avenwedde, and its layout encompasses some 26,100 square meters. The office buildings were erected in 1976 and expanded in 1990. In addition to the typical facilities, the headquarters in Gütersloh also feature the &quot;Bertelsmann University&quot;, an academic institution for Bertelsmann executives. In 1992, Bertelsmann purchased the Bertelsmann Building in New York City and located its North American headquarters there. The building was re-sold in 2004. The Berlin representative office was opened in 2003 in the Kommandantenhaus in the historic center of Berlin. As part of international activities, Bertelsmann established additional locations at the corporate level (Corporate Centers) in Beijing (2006), New Delhi (2012) and São Paulo (2012).

Worldwide, with all divisions, Bertelsmann has almost 350 locations. The majority are in Europe, where the group earns the largest share of its revenues. Over the past years, the group has increasingly focused on the newly industrialized nations of Brazil, China and India. In Brazil, efforts have been aimed at expanding activities above all in the field of education. Bertelsmann has already been involved in China since 1992, and today all divisions are represented there. In India, Bertelsmann is focused on growth in the e-commerce sector, among others.

== Criticism ==
In the 1990s, critical questions arose as to the role of Bertelsmann in Nazi Germany. They were precipitated by a speech given by the chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas Middelhoff, on the occasion of his receiving the Vernon A. Walters Award 1998 in New York City. Thomas Middelhoff portrayed Bertelsmann as one of the few non-Jewish media companies shut down by the National Socialists because it allegedly published subversive literature. This interpretation was severely criticized, for example, by publicist Hersch Fischler. The speech led to a broad public debate and ultimately in 1998 to the establishment of an independent historical commission (IHC) by the group. This was headed by Saul Friedländer, and additional members were Norbert Frei, Trutz Rendtorff and Reinhard Wittmann. The IHC presented an interim report in the year 2000 and issued a final report in 2002. It stated, for example, that the suggestion that the &quot;C. Bertelsmann Verlag&quot; mounted resistance against National Socialism was clearly not accurate. The company&#x27;s &quot;shut-down as a publisher of the resistance&quot; could not be proven. Historian Volker Ullrich said in the weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot; that the notion of the company&#x27;s being &quot;a resistance publisher&quot; was clearly baseless. The files of the IHC have been publicly available in the company archives of Bertelsmann in Gütersloh since 2003. In October 2002 the Bertelsmann conglomerate publicly expressed regret for its &quot;conduct under the Nazis, and for later efforts to cover it up&quot;.

<text>Joannes or John Zonaras ( ; 1070 – 1140) was a Byzantine Roman historian, chronicler and theologian who lived in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey). Under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos he held the offices of head justice and private secretary (&quot;protasēkrētis&quot;) to the emperor, but after Alexios&#x27; death, he retired to the monastery on the Island of Hagia Glykeria, (İncir Adası, in the Bay of Tuzla), where he spent the rest of his life writing books.

== Life ==
Almost nothing is known of Zonaras&#x27;s life. However, various elements can be inferred from his own writings. In one of his writings he states that he &quot;saw&quot; the second marriage of an emperor. This could have been the marriage of Nikephoros III with Maria of Alania in late 1078 or perhaps even the marriage of Manuel I Komnenos to Maria of Antioch in 1161 which would put Zonaras&#x27; death significantly later. It&#x27;s not known with certainty if Zonaras served under John II Komnenos (r. 1118–1143), although this is still a possibility. Zonaras&#x27; &quot;Epitome&quot; served as the basis of Constantine Manasses&#x27; chronicle, which was commissioned by Irene Komnene, the widow of the &quot;sebastokrator&quot; Andronikos Komnenos. Given that Irene died on (or shortly before) 1153, this work must have been written 1150 or 1145. Furthermore, it&#x27;s possible that Irene requested this shorter chronicle precisely because she had already seen Zonaras&#x27; &quot;Epitome&quot;. Therefore, it can be inferred that Zonaras had already died by 1145.

His most important work, &quot;Extracts of History&quot; (, ), in eighteen books, extends from the creation of the world to the death of Alexius (1118). The earlier part is largely drawn from Josephus; for Roman history he chiefly followed Cassius Dio up to the early third century. Contemporary scholars are particularly interested in his account of the third and fourth centuries, which depend upon sources, now lost, whose nature is fiercely debated. Central to this debate is the work of Bruno Bleckmann, whose arguments tend to be supported by continental scholars but rejected in part by English-speaking scholars. An English translation of these important sections has recently been published. The chief original part of Zonaras&#x27; history is the section on the reign of Alexios I Komnenos, whom he criticizes for the favour shown to members of his family, to whom Alexios entrusted vast estates and significant state offices. His history was continued by Nicetas Acominatus.

Various ecclesiastical works have been attributed to Zonaras — commentaries on the Church Fathers and the poems of Gregory of Nazianzus; lives of Saints; and a treatise on the Apostolic Canons — and there is no reason to doubt their genuineness. The lexicon, however, which has been handed down under his name (ed. J. A. H. Tittmann 1808) is probably the work of a certain Antonius Monachus (Stein&#x27;s Herodotus, ii.479 f). The first ecclesiastical denunciation of the game of chess on the part of the Eastern Orthodox Church was voiced by Zonaras. It was during his retirement as a monk to the monastery of Mount Athos that he wrote his commentary on the canons of the Eastern Church. The Quinisext Council required both clergy and laity to give up the use of dice (Canon 50). Zonaras wanted chess to also be included for clergy and laity to give up.

Zonaras, commenting on Canon 50, wrote, &quot;Because there are some of the Bishops and clergy who depart from virtue and play chess (&quot;zatikron&quot;) or dice or drink to excess, the Rule commands that such shall cease to do so or be excluded; and if a Bishop or elder or deacon or subdeacon or reader or singer do not cease so to do, he shall be cast out: and if laymen be given to chess-playing and drunkenness, they shall be excluded.&quot;

<text>Bad Brains are an American punk rock band formed in Washington, D.C., in 1976. They are widely regarded as pioneers of hardcore punk, though the band&#x27;s members have objected to the use of this term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip hop, and soul. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called them &quot;the mother of all black hard-rock bands&quot;, and they have been cited as a seminal influence to numerous other subgenres in addition to hardcore punk, including various subgenres of heavy metal, such as thrash/speed metal, alternative metal, and funk metal. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement.

Bad Brains have released nine studio albums. They have broken up and reformed several times over their career, sometimes with different singers or drummers. The band originally formed in 1976 as a jazz fusion act under the name Mind Power. Their classic lineup includes singer H.R., guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson. This lineup was intact until 1987 and has reunited periodically in the years since. Many notable bands and artists cite Bad Brains as an artistic influence on their music.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1976–1985)===

The band&#x27;s origins date to 1976, when the members first came together as a jazz fusion band called Mind Power, in the mold of bands such as Return to Forever and Mahavishnu Orchestra. The group included lead guitarist Dr. Know (Gary Miller), bassist Darryl Jenifer, and brothers Paul Hudson (later known as H.R.) on rhythm guitar and Earl Hudson on drums.

In 1977, the band&#x27;s then-singer Sid McCray introduced them to punk rock. Mind Power decided to switch their sound to hardcore punk and changed their name to Bad Brains, after the Ramones song &quot;Bad Brain.&quot; Despite their burgeoning punk sound, after seeing Bob Marley in concert the band also became interested in reggae music and the Rastafari movement. McCray was briefly the singer for the new hardcore punk incarnation of the band, but he soon departed, and H.R. switched from guitar to lead vocals.

The band gained a fan base in Washington D.C. due to their high-energy performances and occasional reggae songs. In 1979, they were blacklisted from many Washington area clubs due to their destructive fans; this was later addressed in their song &quot;Banned in D.C.&quot;. Around 1980, the band relocated to New York City, where they would serve as a catalyst for that city&#x27;s then-burgeoning hardcore scene. 

By 1982, they were a regular act at the New York venue CBGB. Dr. Know recalled, &quot;We played CB&#x27;s every friggin&#x27; night. This whole &#x27;Sunday matinee&#x27; thing is from us. When we first played, nobody was there. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;Who are these niggers?&#x27; And we&#x27;re in their face, killing it. We got a weekend day, and by then a little buzz started happening.&quot; Their self-titled debut album was released on the ROIR label, originally on cassette only, in 1982, followed in 1983 by &quot;Rock for Light&quot;, produced by Ric Ocasek of The Cars. In 1985, the Bad Brains song &quot;Pay to Cum&quot; was featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;After Hours&quot;.

===Stylistic expansion and line-up changes (1986–1994)===
In 1986, Bad Brains signed with SST Records and released &quot;I Against I&quot;. In addition to the band&#x27;s hardcore punk and reggae sounds, this album added elements from heavy metal and funk. H.R. provided the vocals for the song &quot;Sacred Love&quot; over the phone from the Lorton Reformatory while serving time for a cannabis charge. H.R. gained additional critical notice for his expanded vocal style on &quot;I Against I&quot;; according to Rick Anderson of AllMusic, &quot;[HR] digs deep into his bag of voices and pulls them all out, one by one: the frightening nasal falsetto that was his signature in the band&#x27;s hardcore days, an almost bel canto baritone, and a declamatory speed-rap chatter that spews lyrics with the mechanical precision of a machine gun&quot;. 
H.R. and Earl Hudson quit the band in 1987 to focus on reggae music. Touring for &quot;I Against I&quot; was completed with singer Taj Singleton and former Cro-Mags drummer Mackie Jayson. In 1988, Bad Brains signed with Caroline Records and began recording the album &quot;Quickness&quot;. The album was recorded with Singleton and Jayson, but the Hudson brothers returned to the band in 1989 and H.R. replaced Singleton&#x27;s work with new lyrics and vocals.

During this period, the Hudson brothers, who wanted to steer the band toward reggae, often clashed with Dr. Know and Jenifer, who were increasingly interested in hard rock and heavy metal. H.R. often failed to turn up for scheduled concerts and recording sessions. After the tour supporting &quot;Quickness&quot; ended in 1989, the Hudson brothers again quit the band. Mackie Jayson again joined on drums. Former Faith No More member Chuck Mosley took over on lead vocals in 1990–91, and was then replaced by Israel Joseph I (Dexter Pinto). In 1990, the band collaborated with Henry Rollins on a cover of The MC5&#x27;s &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, which appears on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;.

As bands influenced by Bad Brains (such as Living Colour and Fishbone) enjoyed commercial success, Epic Records approached Dr. Know in 1992 and offered the band their first major-label record deal. The album &quot;Rise&quot; was released by Epic in 1993. Jayson left the band in the middle of the ensuing tour and was temporarily replaced by Chuck Treece.

===Original line-up reunions and name change (1994–2004)===
The Hudson brothers again returned to the band in 1994, and they signed with Maverick Records for the 1995 album &quot;God of Love&quot;. In support of the album, Bad Brains opened for the Beastie Boys on their &quot;Ill Communication&quot; tour, and headlined a U.S. tour with a then-unknown Deftones. However, the reunion did not last for long, because of H.R.&#x27;s erratic behavior while performing and several violent incidents against the band&#x27;s manager, fans, and venue employees. H.R. landed in jail and the band broke up once again.

In 1997 Bad Brains reconvened to remaster some early recordings, which were released as the EP &quot;The Omega Sessions.&quot; From 1998 to 2001, the original lineup toured under the name Soul Brains and released two live albums.

===&quot;Build a Nation&quot; and &quot;Into the Future&quot; (2005–2015)===

In 2005 the band, known once again as Bad Brains, announced that they were recording their first album of new material in ten years, with MCA of the Beastie Boys producing. They played their first shows in several years at CBGB in 2006. &quot;Build a Nation&quot; was released in 2007. The band toured extensively in 2007–08, with former singer Israel Joseph I filling in for H.R. on some dates. Daryl Jenifer released the solo album &quot;In Search of Black Judas&quot; in 2010. A short Bad Brains tour of Australia planned for 2010 was cancelled for health reasons.

Bad Brains announced the recording of another new album in 2011. &quot;Into the Future&quot; was released in late 2012, and included a tribute to the recently deceased MCA. On the ensuing tour, the band added touring keyboardist Jamie Saft. In 2014 the band hinted at another new album, though no such album has yet been released. Also in 2014, author Greg Prato released the book &quot;Punk! Hardcore! Reggae! PMA! Bad Brains!&quot; which recounted the band&#x27;s history. In 2015 the band recorded the live EP &quot;The Woodstock Sessions&quot;; H.R. did not participate for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Jamaican singer Jesse Royal. H.R.&#x27;s status at the band remained unclear throughout that year.

===Recent developments (2015–present)===
In November 2015, Dr. Know suffered a heart attack and was placed on life support due to the risk of organ failure. After three months in the hospital he made a full recovery, thanks in part to a GoFundMe campaign organized by his bandmates. In March 2016, H.R. announced that he had been diagnosed with a rare type of headache called SUNCT, and received treatment for this condition and other ongoing health issues thanks to another GoFundMe campaign.

In October 2016, Bad Brains were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but were not inducted. In a December 2016 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Dr. Know and Darryl Jenifer discussed the band members&#x27; health issues and the future of the band. They announced that they hoped to record a new album titled &quot;Mind Power&quot;, after the band&#x27;s short-lived original moniker. In June 2017 the band played a show featuring guest appearances by Randy Blythe and original Bad Brains singer Sid McCray, who sang with the band for the first time in 39 years.

Former singer Chuck Mosley died in November 2017. Sid McCray died in September 2020.

==Legacy==
Many notable bands and artists cite Bad Brains as an artistic influence on their music, including the Beastie Boys, Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Soundgarden, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, Deftones, Clutch, Green Day, the Offspring, the Roots, Lamb of God, Sublime, No Doubt, Anthrax, Living Colour, 311 and Fishbone.
