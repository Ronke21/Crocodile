<text>Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy (: March 22, 1869February 6, 1964) was a Filipino revolutionary, statesman, and military leader who became the first president of the Philippines (1899–1901), and the first president of an Asian constitutional republic. It was the shortest term as president of the Philippines. He led the Philippine forces first against Spain in the Philippine Revolution (1896–1898), then in the Spanish–American War (1898), and finally against the United States during the Philippine–American War (1899–1901). He is regarded in the Philippines as having been the country&#x27;s first president during the period of the First Philippine Republic, though he was not recognized as such outside of the revolutionary Philippines.

Aguinaldo is known as a national hero in the Philippines. However, he was also known to be somewhat controversial due to his alleged involvement in the deaths of the revolutionary leader Andrés Bonifacio and general Antonio Luna, and for his collaboration with the Empire of Japan during their occupation of the Philippines in World War II.
==Early life and career==
Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy was born on March 22, 1869 in Cavite el Viejo (present-day Kawit) in the province of Cavite to Carlos Aguinaldo y Jamir and Trinidad Famy y Villanueva, a couple that had eight children, the seventh of whom was Emilio. He was baptized and raised in Roman Catholicism. The Aguinaldo family was quite well-to-do as his father, Carlos Aguinaldo, was the community&#x27;s appointed &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; (municipal governor) in the Spanish Viceregal administration. He studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran, but could not finish his studies due to an outbreak of cholera in 1882.

He became a cabeza de barangay in 1895 when the Maura Law called for the reorganization of local governments. At the age of 25, Aguinaldo became Cavite el Viejo&#x27;s first &quot;gobernadorcillo capitan municipal&quot; (municipal governor-captain) while he was on a business trip in Mindoro.

==Philippine Revolution==


On January 1, 1895, Aguinaldo became a Freemason, joining Pilar Lodge No. 203, Imus, Cavite by the codename &quot;Colon&quot;.

On March 7, 1895, Santiago Alvarez, whose father was a &quot;Capitan Municipal&quot; (Mayor) of Noveleta, encouraged Aguinaldo to join the &quot;Katipunan&quot;, a secret organization led by Andrés Bonifacio that was dedicated to the expulsion of the Spanish and the independence of the Philippines through armed force. Aguinaldo joined the organization and used the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Magdalo in honor of Mary Magdalene. The local chapter of Katipunan in Cavite was established and named &quot;Sangguniang Magdalo&quot;, and Aguinaldo&#x27;s cousin Baldomero Aguinaldo was appointed leader.

The Katipunan-led Philippine Revolution against the Spanish began in the last week of August 1896 in San Juan del Monte (now part of Metro Manila). However, Aguinaldo and other Cavite rebels initially refused to join in the offensive for lack of arms. Bonifacio and other rebels were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare, but Aguinaldo and the Cavite rebels won major victories in carefully planned and well-timed set-piece battles and temporarily drove the Spanish out of their area. On August 31, 1896, Aguinaldo started the assault by beginning as a skirmish to the full-blown revolt Kawit Revolt. He marched with his army of bolomen to the town center of Kawit. Prior to the battle, Aguinaldo strictly ordered his men not to kill anyone in his hometown. Upon his men&#x27;s arrival at the town center, the guards, armed with Remingtons and unaware of the preceding events, were caught completely by surprise and surrendered immediately. The guns there were captured and armed by the Katipuneros, and the revolt was a major success for Aguinaldo and his men. Later that afternoon, they raised the Magdalo flag at the town hall to a large crowd of people from Kawit that had assembled after it heard of the city&#x27;s liberation.

The Magdalo faction of the Katipunan, which also operated in Cavite under Gen. Aguinaldo, used flags similar to those used by the Magdiwang faction and featuring a white sun with a red baybayin symbol for &quot;Ka&quot;.

The symbol has recently been revived by a breakaway group of army officers to show the end of war with Spain after the peace agreement. The flag became the first official banner of the revolutionary forces and was blessed in a crowd celebrated at Imus. Aguinaldo referred to this flag in his proclamation of October 31, 1896: &quot;Filipino people!! The hour has arrived to shed blood for the conquest of our liberty. Assemble and follow the flag of the Revolution – it stands for Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.&quot;

===Battle of Imus===
In August 1896, as coordinated attacks broke out and sparked the revolution beginning in Manila. Aguinaldo marched from Kawit with 600 men and launched a series of skirmishes at Imus that eventually ended in open hostilities against Spanish troops stationed there. On September 1, with the aid of Captain Jose Tagle of Imus, they laid siege against Imus to draw the Spanish out. A Spanish relief column commanded by Brigadier-General Ernesto de Aguirre had been dispatched from Manila to aid the beleaguered Spanish defenders of Imus. Supported only by 100 troops and by cavalry, Aguirre gave the impression that he had been sent out to suppress a minor disturbance. Aguinaldo and his men counterattacked but suffered heavy losses that almost cost his own life. Despite the success, Aguirre did not press the attack, felt the inadequacy of his troops, and hastened back to Manila to get reinforcements. During the lull in the fighting, Aguinaldo&#x27;s troops reorganized and prepared for another Spanish attack. On September 3, Aguirre came back with a much larger force of 3,000 men. When Spanish troops arrived at the Isabel II Bridge, they were fired upon by the concealed rebels. The Spanish force was routed, withdrawing in disorder with substantial casualties. Among the abandoned Spanish weapons was Aguirre&#x27;s sword, which was carried by Aguinaldo in future battles.

===Battles of Binakayan-Dalahican===

Alarmed by previous siege, led by General Aguinaldo in Imus, in September 1896, Governor-General Ramón Blanco y Erenas ordered the 4th Battalion of Cazadores from Spain to aid him in quelling the rebellion in Cavite. On November 3, 1896, the battalion arrived carrying a squadron of 1,328 men and some 55 officers. Also, Blanco ordered about 8,000 men who recently came from Cuba and Spain to join in suppressing the rebellion. Prior to the land attacks, Spanish naval raids were conducted on the shores of Cavite, where cannons bombarded the revolutionary fortifications in Bacoor, Noveleta, Binakayan, and Cavite Viejo. The most fortified locations in Noveleta were the Dalahican and Dagatan shores, defended by &quot;Magdiwang&quot; soldiers commanded by General Santiago Alvarez, and the adjacent fishing village of Binakayan in Kawit was fortified by &quot;Magdalo&quot; under General Aguinaldo. Spanish naval operations were determined to crush the fortifications in these areas, mainly because the lake around Dalahican was strategic by connecting to the interior of Cavite. Apart from defending Binakayan, the &quot;Magdalo&quot; soldiers also kept the lower part of Dagatan up to Cavite&#x27;s border near Manila province. Between the barrios of Binakayan and Dalahican, the Spanish forces lost decisively since the Filipino rebels, led by Aguinaldo and Alvarez, routed them back to Cavite Nuevo in which the remaining Spanish troops would eventually surrender. The successful defenses of Binakayan and Dalahican was considered to be the first major victory of the Filipinos over a colonial power.

===Battle of Zapote Bridge===

Newly appointed Governor-General Camilo de Polavieja, was now fully aware that the main weight of the revolution was in Cavite and so decided to launch a two-pronged assault to defeat the revolutionaries, led by Aguinaldo. He ordered General José de Lachambre with a much bigger force to march against Silang to take on the &quot;Katipuneros&quot; from the rear, and he would engage the Filipinos head on. On February 13, 1897, Aguinaldo ordered soldiers to plant dynamite along the bridge and to place pointed bamboo sticks in the river beds below the bridge. Several hours later, 12,000 Spaniards began to cross the bridge. The trap was sprung, and the dynamite was detonated, which killed several Spanish troops and injured many more. The rebels then emerged from the bushes, fought hand to hand, and repelled consecutive waves of enemy troops charging across the river. Edilberto Evangelista was shot in the head and died. Cavite Province gradually emerged as the Revolution&#x27;s hotbed, and the Aguinaldo-led &quot;Katipuneros&quot; had a string of victories there. After the battle, the demoralized Spanish soldiers retreated towards Muntinlupa.

===Spanish Cavite offensive and Battle of Perez Dasmariñas===

While Polavieja was poised to strike at Zapote, another Spanish contingent is marching towards Aguinaldo&#x27;s rear. On February 15, 1897, the Spaniards launched the powerful Cavite offensive to drive and crush Filipino revolutionaries under Aguinaldo and his &quot;Magdalo&quot; forces that held numerous victories against the Spanish in the early stages of the revolution. Renewed and fully equipped with 100 cannons, 23,000 Spanish &quot;cazadores&quot; forces under Major General Jose de Lachambre saw town after town fall back to the Crown. Starting the offensive at Pamplona, Cavite, and Bayungyungan, Batangas, Lachambre&#x27;s men later marched deep into the heart of Aguinaldo&#x27;s home province.

Having just won the Battle of Zapote Bridge, Aguinaldo turned his attention at the new Spanish threat and was determined to recapture most of Cavite. Aguinaldo decided to deploy his forces at Pasong Santol, a bottleneck of Perez Dasmariñas on the way to Imus, which rendered the Spanish immobile and served the revolutionaries by its natural defensive positions. On February 19, Silang fell to the Spanish juggernaut despite attempts by Filipino forces to defend and then to recover it. Nine days later, Spanish forces marched into Dasmariñas to reclaim the town. A week later, Spanish troops used artillery pieces well to attack again as they moved towards Aguinaldo&#x27;s capital, Imus. Meanwhile, on March 22 at the Tejeros Convention, Aguinaldo was voted &quot;in absentia&quot; as president of the reorganized revolutionary government. Colonel Vicente Riego de Dios was sent by the assembly to fetch Aguinaldo, who was in Pasong Santol. Aguinaldo refused to come and Crispulo Aguinaldo, his older brother, was sent to talk to him. Crispulo greeted and talked to his brother and explained his purpose, but Aguinaldo was hesitant to leave his post because of the pending attack of the Spanish in Dasmariñas. Crispulo took over Aguinaldo&#x27;s leadership in the battle, which had been stalemated since March 7, and Aguinaldo traveled to San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias, Cavite) to take his oath as president.

===Tejeros Convention===
Conflict within the ranks of the Katipunan factions, specifically between the Magdalo and Magdiwang, led to the Imus assembly in Cavite Province, presided over by Bonifacio. The rebels of Cavite were rumored to have made overtures to establish a revolutionary government in place of the Katipunan. Though Bonifacio already considered the Katipunan to be a government, he acquiesced and presided over a convention held on March 22, 1897, in Tejeros, San Francisco de Malabon, Cavite. Aguinaldo was elected president, even though he was occupied with military matters in Imus and not in attendance. Mariano Trias was elected as vice-president, Artemio Ricarte as captain-general, Emiliano Riego de Dios as the director of war, and Andres Bonifacio as director of the interior. The results were questioned by Daniel Tirona for Bonifacio&#x27;s qualifications for that position. Bonifacio was insulted and declared, &quot;I, as chairman of this assembly, and as President of the Supreme Council of the Katipunan, as all of you do not deny, declare this assembly dissolved, and I annul all that has been approved and resolved.&quot; Regardless of the nullification, Aguinaldo traveled surreptitiously to San Francisco de Malabon where, on the evening of March 23, he took an oath assuming the office to which he had been elected as Generalissimo of the Philippine Islands.

===Biak-na-Bato and exile===

The Spanish Army launched an attack that forced the revolutionary forces under Aguinaldo into a retreat. On June 24, 1897, Aguinaldo arrived at Biak-na-Bato, San Miguel, Bulacan, and established a headquarters there in what is now called &quot;Aguinaldo Cave&quot; in Biak-na-Bato National Park. In late October 1897, Aguinaldo convened an assembly of generals at Biak-na-Bato that decided to establish a constitutional republic. A constitution, patterned closely after the Cuban Constitution, was drawn up by Isabelo Artacho and Felix Ferrer and provided for the creation of a Supreme Council composed of a president, a vice president, a Secretary of War, and a Secretary of the Treasury. Aguinaldo was named president.
In March 1897, Fernando Primo de Rivera, 1st Marquis of Estella, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, had been encouraging prominent Filipinos to contact Aguinaldo for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. On August 9, the Manila lawyer Pedro Paterno met with Aguinaldo at Biak-na-Bato with a proposal for peace based on reforms and amnesty. In succeeding months, Paterno conducted shuttle diplomacy, acting as an intermediary between de Rivera and Aguinaldo. On December 14–15, 1897, Aguinaldo signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato under which Aguinaldo effectively agreed to end hostilities and to dissolve his government in exchange for amnesty and &quot;₱800,000 (Mexican)&quot; (Aguinaldo&#x27;s description of the $MXN800,000 amount) as an indemnity. The documents were signed on December 14–15, 1897. On December 23, Aguinaldo and other revolutionary officials departed for Hong Kong to enter voluntary exile. MXN$400,000, representing the first installment of the indemnity, was deposited into Hong Kong banks. In exile, Aguinaldo reorganized his revolutionary government into the &quot;Hong Kong Junta&quot; and enlarged it into the &quot;Supreme Council of the Nation&quot;.

===Return to the Philippines===

On April 25, the Spanish–American War began. The war mostly focused on Cuba, but the US Navy&#x27;s Asiatic Squadron was in Hong Kong and, commanded by Commodore George Dewey, it sailed for the Philippines. On May 1, 1898, in the Battle of Manila Bay, the squadron engaged attacked and destroyed the Spanish Army and Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron and proceeded to blockade Manila. Several days later, Dewey agreed to transport Aguinaldo from Hong Kong to the Philippines aboard the USS &quot;McCulloch&quot;, which left Hong Kong with Aguinaldo on May 16 and arrived in Cavite on May 19. Aguinaldo promptly resumed the command of revolutionary forces and besieged Manila.

===Dictatorial government and Battle of Alapan===

Aguinaldo had brought with him the draft constitution of Mariano Ponce for the establishment of federal revolutionary republic upon his return to Manila, but on May 24, 1898, in Cavite, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation upon the advice of his war counselor Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, and Aguinaldo assumed the command of all Philippine forces and established a dictatorial government with himself as titular dictator and power vested upon him to administer decrees promulgated under his sole responsibility. The dictatorial government was provisional in character until peace was established and unrestrained liberty attained. Dean Worcester wrote, &quot;although the title of &#x27;president&#x27; was assumed by Aguinaldo, as more likely to be favourably considered in the United States than &#x27;dictator&#x27;, the tendency of his followers who had not been educated in Europe was to speak of and to regard him not as a president, but as an overlord holding all power in his hands.&quot;

On May 28, 1898, Aguinaldo gathered a force of about 18,000 troops and fought against a small garrison of Spanish troops in Alapan, Imus, Cavite. The battle lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. After the victory at Alapan, Aguinaldo unfurled the Philippine flag for the first time and hoisted it at the Teatro Caviteño in Cavite Nuevo (present-day Cavite City) in front of Filipino revolutionaries and more than 300 captured Spanish troops. A group of American sailors of the US Asiatic Squadron also witnessed the unfurling. Flag Day is celebrated every May 28 to honor the battle.

===Declaration of independence and revolutionary government===

On June 12, Aguinaldo promulgated the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain in his own mansion house in Cavite El Viejo, believing that declaration would inspire the Filipino people to eagerly rise against the Spaniards. On June 18, he issued a decree formally establishing his dictatorial government in which he also provided the organization of the local government and the establishment and the composition of the Revolutionary Congress.

On June 23, Aguinaldo issued a decree replacing his dictatorial government with a revolutionary government with himself as president upon the recommendation of his adviser Apolinario Mabini. The decree defined the organization of the central government and the establishment and the election of delegates to the Revolutionary Congress and to prepare the shift from a revolutionary government to a republic.
===Arrival of American troops===

By May 1898, Filipino troops had cleared Cavite of Spanish forces. In late June 1898, Aguinaldo, with the help of American allies, who were now landing in Cavite, was now preparing to drive the Spaniards out of Manila. The first contingent of American troops arrived in Cavite on June 30, the second under General Francis V. Greene on July 17, and the third under General Arthur MacArthur Jr on July 30. By then, 12,000 US troops had landed in the Philippines.

Aguinaldo had presented surrender terms to Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Basilio Augustín, who refused them initially since he believed that more Spanish troops would be sent to lift the siege. As the combined forces of Filipinos and Americans were closing in, Augustín realized that his position was hopeless, secretly continued to negotiate with Aguinaldo, and even offered ₱1 million, but Aguinaldo refused. When the Spanish Cortes learned of Augustín&#x27;s attempt to negotiate the surrender of his army to Filipinos under Aguinaldo, it was furious and relieved Augustín of his duties effective July 24. He was replaced by Fermin Jáudenes. On June 16, warships departed Spain to lift the siege, but they altered course for Cuba where a Spanish fleet was imperiled by the US Navy.

In August 1898, life in Intramuros, the walled center of Manila, had become unbearable, and the normal population of about 10,000 was now 70,000. Realizing that it was only a matter of time before the city fell and fearing vengeance and looting if the city fell to Filipino revolutionaries, Jáudenes, suggested to Dewey, through the Belgian consul, Édouard André, for the city to be surrendered to the Americans after a short, &quot;mock&quot; battle. Dewey had initially rejected the suggestion because he lacked the troops to block Filipino revolutionary forces, which numbered 40 000, but when Merritt&#x27;s troops became available, he sent a message to Jáudenes, agreeing to the mock battle. A bloodless mock battle had been planned, but Spanish troops opened fire in a skirmish that left six Americans and forty-nine Spaniards dead after Filipino revolutionaries, thinking that the attack was genuine, joined advancing US troops. Besides the unplanned casualties, the battle went according to plan. The Spanish surrendered the city to the Americans, and it did not fall to the Filipino revolutionaries, who felt betrayed. By the end of September, Aguinaldo&#x27;s forces had captured over 9,000 Spanish prisoners, who were relieved of their weapons. They were generally free to move around but remained within the control of Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo did not know that on December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris had been signed; it transferred the Philippines from Spain to the United States for the sum of $20 million.

==First Philippine Republic==
The First Philippine Republic was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 21, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan and endured until capture of Aguinaldo by the American forces on March 23, 1901, in Palanan, Isabela, which effectively dissolved the First Republic. Aguinaldo wrote in Tarlac during the First Republic the Tagalog manuscript of his autobiographical work, which would later be translated by Felipe Buencamino into Spanish and released as &quot;Reseña Veridica de la Revolucion Filipina&quot; (in English, &quot;True Account of the Philippine Revolution&quot;).
On August 13, 1898, American forces had captured Manila during the &quot;mock&quot; Battle of Manila and on August 14, 1898, established the United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands, with Major-General Wesley Merritt as the first American Military Governor. On the night of February 4, 1899, a Filipino was shot by an American sentry. That incident was considered to be the beginning of the Philippine–American War and culminated in the 1899 Battle of Manila between American and Filipino forces. Superior American military technology drove Filipino troops away from the city, and Aguinaldo&#x27;s government had to move from one place to another as defeats mounted. At the Battle of Marilao River, Aguinaldo himself took command in a desperate attempt to prevent American crossings. The Americans gained superiority in the battle only after severe fighting and the use of gunboats in the river that &quot;made great execution&quot; of Filipino soldiers. On November 13, 1899, Aguinaldo issued an order disbanding the remnants of the Filipino national army; in the same order, he formulated a strategy of guerrilla warfare. Aguinaldo subsequently fled to Northern Luzon, where he continued to exercise command.

=== National cabinet ===
===Capture and declaration of allegiance to the U.S.===
On March 23, 1901, with the aid of Macabebe Scouts forces led by General Frederick Funston, Aguinaldo was captured in his headquarters in Palanan, Isabela. On April 19, 1901, Aguinaldo took an oath of allegiance to the United States, formally ending the First Republic and recognizing the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. He published a manifesto in which he acknowledged that most of the Filipino people had united around the United States, declaring &quot;unmistakably in favor of peace&quot;, said, &quot;a complete termination of hostilities and lasting peace are not only desirable, but absolutely essential to the welfare of the Philippine Islands.&quot; In this manifesto, he acknowledged and accepted U.S. sovereignty throughout the Philippines.

==Controversies==
=== Execution of Bonifacio brothers ===
Bonifacio refused to recognize the revolutionary government that was elected in the Tejeros Convention and reasserted his authority via the Acta de Tejeros and the Naic Military Agreement. He accused the Magdalo faction of treason and issued orders that are contradictory and contravention to the revolutionary government. On April 25, 1897, several complaints were sent to Aguinaldo, notably by Severino de las Alas, a known supporter and loyalist of Bonifacio, along with Jose Coronel, and many others, that Bonifacio and his men ransacked, pillaged and burned the town of Indang, stealing the carabaos and other work animals by force and killed them for food and terrorized the townspeople for being unable to give enough supplies and other provisions due to poor harvest. Aguinaldo was then forced to order the arrest of Bonifacio. After the trials, Andrés and his brother, Procopio, were ordered by the Consejo dela Guerra (Council of War) to be executed by firing squad under the command of Major Lazaro Macapagal on May 10, 1897, near Mount Nagpatong, Mount Buntis, Mount Pumutok, and Maragondon, Cavite. Aguinaldo had pardoned the Bonifacio brothers and that they should be exiled in Pico de Loro, but Pío del Pilar and Mariano Noriel, both former supporters and loyalist of Bonifacio, along with other high-ranking generals of the revolution, forced Aguinaldo to withdraw the order for the sake of preserving unity. According to Aguinaldo, in his two books &quot;Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan&quot; and &quot;A Second Look at America&quot;, he stated that his withdrawal of the commutation order/exile did not mean immediate implementation of the death verdict, that Noriel had misconstrued this and acted hastily. He says he wanted a little more time for a cooling-off period so that eventually the Bonifacio brothers would be forgiven and pardoned.

===Assassination of Luna===

Antonio Luna was a highly regarded general in the revolution who was sometimes at odds with Aguinaldo. On June 2, 1899, Luna received one telegram (he failed to receive two others) sent by Aguinaldo himself, According to Ambeth Ocampo, the message that Aguinaldo sent stated &quot;Felipe Buencamino is detained without ordering the formation of the case. I await your reply to my previous telegram where I request the basis for your accusation. Beseech urgency.&quot;

Luna wrote to Arcadio Maxilom, military commander of Cebu, to stand firm in the war. Luna set off from Bayambang, first by train, then on horseback, and eventually in three carriages, to Nueva Ecija with 25 of his men.
 During the journey, two of the carriages broke down and so he proceeded with just one carriage with Colonel Francisco Román and Captain Eduardo Rusca, having earlier shed his cavalry escort. On June 4, Luna sent a telegram to Aguinaldo to confirm his arrival. Upon arriving at Cabanatuan on June 5, Luna alone proceeded to the headquarters to communicate with the president. As he went up the stairs, he ran into two men: Felipe Buencamino, Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Cabinet; and Captain Pedro Janolino. The commander of the Kawit Battalion, Janolino was an old enemy whom Luna had disarmed for insubordination, and once threatened with arrest for favoring American autonomy. General Luna was told that Aguinaldo had left for San Isidro in Nueva Ecija. (He had actually gone to Bamban in Tarlac.) Enraged, Luna asked why he had not been told that the meeting had been canceled.

The general and the captain exchanged heated words as Luna was about to depart. In the plaza, a rifle shot rang out. Still outraged and furious, Luna rushed down the stairs and met Janolino, accompanied by some elements of the Kawit Battalion. Janolino swung his bolo at Luna, wounding him in the head. Janolino&#x27;s men fired at Luna while others started stabbing him even as he tried to fire his revolver at one of his attackers. He staggered out into the plaza where Román and Rusca were rushing to his aid, but as he lay dying, they too were set upon and shot, with Román being killed and Rusca being severely wounded. Luna received more than 30 wounds and uttered &quot;Traitors! Assassins!&quot; He was hurriedly buried in the churchyard, and Aguinaldo relieved Luna&#x27;s officers and men from the field, including General Venacio Concepción, whose headquarters in Angeles, Pampanga, Aguinaldo besieged the same day that Luna was assassinated.

Immediately after Luna&#x27;s death, confusion reigned on both sides. The Americans even thought that Luna had taken over to replace Aguinaldo. Luna&#x27;s death was publicly declared only by June 8, and a circular providing details of the event released by June 13. Investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna&#x27;s death, but not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García said in 1921 that he was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness then prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that he had nothing to do with the assassination of Luna.

==American era==
During the American period, Aguinaldo largely retired from public life, though continued to support groups that advocated for immediate independence and helped veterans of the struggle. He organized the &quot;Asociación de los Veteranos de la Revolución&quot; (Association of Veterans of the Revolution) to secure pensions for its members and made arrangements for them to buy land by installments from the government.

Displaying the Philippine flag was declared illegal by the Sedition Act of 1907, but it was amended on October 30, 1919. Then, Aguinaldo transformed his home in Kawit into a monument to the flag, the revolution, and the Declaration of Independence. After Aguinaldo&#x27;s death, the government declared the mansion as a National Shrine in June 1964.

=== 1935 Philippine presidential election ===

In 1935, the Philippines became a commonwealth, and presidential elections were held as part of a ten-year transition to complete independence. Aguinaldo returned to public life and ran for the presidency as the candidate of the National Socialist Party (no relation to the German Nazi Party) against the highly popular Nacionalista Party candidate Manuel L. Quezon and Republican Party candidate Gregorio Aglipay. However, Aguinaldo&#x27;s capture by the Americans in 1901 as well as his allegations in the deaths of Bonifacio and Luna had since made him an unpopular figure among the Filipino people, and he lost to Quezon in a landslide, gaining only 17.5% of the popular vote.

Despite his decisive defeat, however, Aguinaldo refused to accept the results of the election, believing it to be rigged against him. In Cavite, the only province he had won, Aguinaldo&#x27;s supporters plotted a rally in Manila to disrupt Quezon&#x27;s inauguration and even assassinate him. However, this planned event was never actually carried out. Aguinaldo continued to criticize Quezon throughout the latter&#x27;s presidency, expressing anti-semitic views when opposing Quezon&#x27;s plan to shelter Jews fleeing from the Holocaust. In 1939, Aguinaldo vigorously expressed his antisemitism by echoing bigoted notions that Jewish people were &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;selfishly materialistic&quot;.

The two men formally reconciled in 1941, when Quezon moved Flag Day to June 12 to commemorate the proclamation of Philippine independence.

== World War II ==
=== Collaboration with Japan and Second Republic ===
On December 8, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the Philippines. The invasion came ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor that had brought the United States into World War II. Aguinaldo, a longtime admirer of the Japanese Empire, sided with them, as he had previously supported groups that demanded the immediate independence of the Philippines, and entrusted that Japan would free the islands from American occupation. In January 1942, Aguinaldo met with General Masami Maeda at the former&#x27;s Cavite residence to discuss the creation of a pro-Japanese provisional government. On February 1, Aguinaldo delivered a radio address calling upon General Douglas MacArthur and all American and Filipino troops fighting in the Battle of Bataan to surrender to the Japanese army.

Following the retreat of American forces, Aguinaldo continued his collaboration with the Japanese. He was appointed as a member of both the provisional Council of State as well as the Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence, which was tasked with creating a new constitution for a Japanese puppet state in the Philippines. Aguinaldo also played a key role in the Kempeitai&#x27;s campaign to suppress anti-Japanese resistance, urging guerrilla fighters to lay down their arms and surrender to Japan. Aguinaldo was present at the inauguration ceremony of the Second Philippine Republic on October 14, 1943, raising the flag with Artemio Ricarte, who had returned to the Philippines from Japan at the request of Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. The Japanese had considered making Aguinaldo president of the republic, a proposal which was supported by Aguinaldo himself, but he was ultimately passed up in favor of former Supreme Court justice Jose P. Laurel.

=== Capture, investigation and acquittal ===
After US forces returned to the Philippines in October 1944, Aguinaldo went into hiding in order to avoid being captured and potentially killed. During the Battle of Manila, however, members of the Marking Guerrillas resistance force were able to track his whereabouts, and arrested him on February 8, 1945. Aguinaldo was then placed under house arrest as the US Army&#x27;s Counterintelligence Corps investigated his collaboration with the Japanese. Despite his claims that he had secretly remained loyal to the US throughout the war, and that he, as well as other Axis collaborators, had only been forced to collaborate with Japan under great duress and should therefore all be granted amnesty, the People&#x27;s Court of the Philippines nonetheless charged Aguinaldo with 11 counts of treason for his &quot;wholehearted&quot; support for and collaboration with the Empire of Japan.

Aguinaldo was 77 when the US government recognized Philippine independence in the Treaty of Manila on July 4, 1946, in accordance with the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934. On January 28, 1948, Philippine president Manuel Roxas granted amnesty to all Filipinos who had collaborated with the Empire of Japan and as a result, Aguinaldo&#x27;s charges were dropped and his trial was never held.

==Independence era==
On July 4, 1946, after the end of World War II and Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the U.S. recognized the Philippines as an independent and sovereign nation.

In 1950, President Elpidio Quirino appointed Aguinaldo as a member of the Philippine Council of State, where he served a full term. He returned to retirement soon afterward and dedicated his time and attention to veteran soldiers&#x27; &quot;interests and welfare.&quot;

He was conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, by the University of the Philippines in 1953.

In 1958, when asked by the Filipino journalist Guillermo Gómez Rivera if he regretted anything in his life, Emilio Aguinaldo stated:On May 12, 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal changed the celebration of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12 to honor Aguinaldo and the Revolution of 1898, rather than the establishment of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands by the United States. Although in poor health by that point, Aguinaldo attended the 1962 Independence Day observances. On August 4, 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 officially proclaimed June 12 to be Philippine Independence Day and renamed the Fourth of July holiday as &quot;Philippine Republic Day&quot;.

==Personal life==

On January 1, 1896, he married his first wife, Hilaria del Rosario (1877–1921). They had five children: Carmen Aguinaldo-Melencio, Emilio &quot;Jun&quot; R. Aguinaldo Jr., Maria Aguinaldo-Poblete, Cristina Aguinaldo-Suntay, and Miguel Aguinaldo. Hilaria died of pulmonary tuberculosis on March 6, 1921, at the age of 44. Nine years later, on July 14, 1930, Aguinaldo married his second wife, Maria Agoncillo (1879–1963), at Barasoain Church. She died on May 29, 1963, a year before Aguinaldo himself.

His grandsons Emilio B. Aguinaldo III and Reynaldo Aguinaldo served three terms as mayor (2007–2016) and vice-mayor of his hometown Kawit, Cavite, respectively. A granddaughter, Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera, was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, serving from 1979 to 1992. One of his great-grandsons, Joseph Emilio Abaya, served as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives and represented Cavite&#x27;s first district, which contained their hometown, Kawit, from 2004 to 2012, and he was appointed Secretary of Transportation and Communications in 2012, a post he that served in until 2016. Another great-grandson, Emilio &quot;Orange&quot; M. Aguinaldo IV, married ABS-CBN news reporter Bernadette Sembrano in 2007. His great-granddaughter, Lizzie Aguinaldo, is a singer under Star Music.

During the revolt against Spain and subsequent conflicts with American forces, Aguinaldo supported the Philippine Independent Church. He became a long-time member, but reverted to Roman Catholicism later in life.

==Death and legacy==

Aguinaldo was rushed to Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) in Quezon City on October 5, 1962, under the care of Dr. Juana Blanco Fernandez, where he stayed for 469 days. He died of coronary thrombosis on February 6, 1964, at 3:05 am PHT, one month before his 95th birthday. Although Aguinaldo had renounced his Roman Catholic faith when battling against Spanish rule, he reconciled with the Church and received the last rites from VMMC&#x27;s Catholic chaplain. A year before his death, he had donated his lot and mansion to the government. The property now serves as a shrine to &quot;perpetuate the spirit of the Revolution of 1896.&quot;
Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal declared February 6 to 20, 1964 as &quot;period of national mourning&quot; over Aguinaldo&#x27;s death. Aguinaldo was accorded a state funeral.
His remains lay in state at his residence in Kawit from February 6 to 11, and then at Malacañang Palace from February 11 to 14. On February 14, his remains were brought to Manila Cathedral for a requiem mass in the morning presided over by Manila Archbishop, Cardinal Rufino Santos, and then to the Legislative Building for public viewing and necrological service on the next day. From Manila, his remains were returned to Kawit on February 15 for a vigil mass and a final requiem mass in the morning of the next day at Kawit Church. His remains were finally interred at the grounds of his residence in Kawit, Cavite.

Aguinaldo&#x27;s book &quot;Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan&quot; (&quot;Memoirs of the Revolution&quot;) was published in 1964. A second publication was made in 1998 for the 100th anniversary of Philippine Independence.

According to Larry M. Henares of the &quot;Manila Standard&quot;, a consensus had formed by the late 20th century that Aguinaldo was the greatest president in Philippine history for his executory role in the Philippine Revolution&#x27;s victory against Spain and his struggle to maintain the nation&#x27;s independence during the Philippine–American War.

<text>The IBM 550 numerical interpreter was the first commercial machine made by IBM that read numerical data punched on cards and printed it across the top of each card. The 550 was introduced in 1930.

Information to be printed could be placed in any sequence via plugboard control panel selections. The machine operated at the rate of 75 cards a minute. The feed hopper had a capacity of 800 cards, and the stacker had a capacity of 1,000 cards.

Alphabetic and numeric characters could be printed by the Type 552 alphabetic interpreter, announced in 1937. It could process 60 cards per minute. The Type 552 was withdrawn in December 1957.

<text>Anthony James &quot;Lonnie&quot; Donegan (29 April 1931 – 3 November 2002) was a British skiffle singer, songwriter and musician, referred to as the &quot;King of Skiffle&quot;, who influenced 1960s British pop and rock musicians. Born in Scotland and brought up in England, Donegan began his career in the British trad jazz revival but transitioned to skiffle in the mid-1950s, rising to prominence with a hit recording of the American folk song &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; which helped spur the broader UK skiffle movement.

Donegan had 31 UK top 30 hit singles, 24 were successive hits and three were number one. He was the first British male singer with two US top 10 hits. Donegan received an Ivor Novello lifetime achievement award in 1995 and in 2000 he was made an MBE.
Donegan was a pivotal figure in the British Invasion due to his influence in the US in the late 1950s.

== Early life ==
Donegan was born in Bridgeton, Glasgow, Scotland, on 29 April 1931. He was the son of an Irish mother (Mary Josephine Deighan) and a Scots father (Peter John Donegan), a professional violinist who had played with the Scottish National Orchestra. In 1933, when Donegan was aged 2, the family moved to East Ham in Essex. Donegan was evacuated to Cheshire to escape the Blitz in the Second World War and attended St Ambrose College in Hale Barns. He lived for a while on Chiswick Mall in Middlesex.

== Trad jazz ==
As a child growing up in the early 1940s Donegan listened mostly to swing jazz and vocal acts, and became interested in the guitar. Country &amp; western and blues records, particularly by Frank Crumit and Josh White, attracted his interest and he bought his first guitar at 14 in 1945. He learned songs such as &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Style&quot;, and &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; by listening to BBC radio broadcasts. By the end of the 1940s he was playing guitar around London and visiting small jazz clubs.

Donegan first played in a major band after Chris Barber heard that he was a good banjo player and, on a train, asked him to audition. Donegan had never played the banjo but he bought one for the audition and succeeded more on personality than talent. His stint with Barber&#x27;s trad jazz band was interrupted when he was called up for National Service in 1949, but while in the army at Southampton, he was the drummer in Ken Grinyer&#x27;s Wolverines Jazz Band at a local pub. A posting to Vienna brought him into contact with American troops, and access to US records and the American Forces Network radio station.

In 1952, he formed the Tony Donegan Jazzband, which played around London. On 28 June 1952 at the Royal Festival Hall they opened for the blues musician Lonnie Johnson. Donegan adopted his first name as a tribute. He used the name at a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 2 June 1952.

In 1953 cornetist Ken Colyer was imprisoned in New Orleans for a visa problem. He returned to Britain and joined Chris Barber&#x27;s band. They changed the name to Ken Colyer&#x27;s Jazzmen and made their first public appearance on 11 April 1953 in Copenhagen. The following day, Chris Albertson recorded Ken Colyer&#x27;s Jazzmen and the Monty Sunshine Trio—Sunshine, Barber, and Donegan—for Storyville Records. These were amongst Donegan&#x27;s first commercial recordings.

== Skiffle ==
While in Ken Colyer&#x27;s Jazzmen with Chris Barber, Donegan sang and played guitar and banjo in their Dixieland set. He began playing with two other band members during the intervals, to provide what posters called a &quot;skiffle&quot; break, a name suggested by Ken Colyer&#x27;s brother, Bill, after the Dan Burley Skiffle Group of the 1930s. In 1954 Colyer left and the band became Chris Barber&#x27;s Jazz Band.

With a washboard, tea-chest bass, and a cheap Spanish guitar, Donegan played folk and blues songs by artists such as Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie. This proved popular and in July 1954 he recorded a fast version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, featuring a washboard but not a tea-chest bass, with &quot;John Henry&quot; on the B-side. It was a hit in 1956 (which also later inspired the creation of a full album, &quot;An Englishman Sings American Folk Songs&quot;, released in America on the Mercury label in the early 1960s), but because it was a band recording, Donegan made no money beyond his session fee. It was the first debut record to go gold in the UK, and it reached the Top Ten in the United States.

The Acoustic Music organisation made this comment about Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;: &quot;It flew up the English charts. Donegan had synthesized American southern blues with simple acoustic instruments: acoustic guitar, washtub bass, and washboard rhythm. The new style was called &#x27;Skiffle&#x27;... and referred to music from people with little money for instruments. The new style captivated an entire generation of post-war youth in England.&quot;

His next single for Decca, &quot;Diggin&#x27; My Potatoes&quot;, was recorded at a concert at the Royal Festival Hall on 30 October 1954. Decca dropped Donegan thereafter, but within a month he was at the Abbey Road Studios in London recording for EMI&#x27;s Columbia label. He had left the Barber band, and by spring 1955, signed a recording contract with Pye. His next single &quot;Lost John&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart.

He appeared on television in the United States on the &quot;Perry Como Show&quot; and the &quot;Paul Winchell Show&quot;. Returning to the UK, he recorded his debut album, &quot;Lonnie Donegan Showcase&quot;, in summer 1956, with songs by Lead Belly and Leroy Carr, plus &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot; and &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;. The LP sold hundreds of thousands. The skiffle style encouraged amateurs and one of many groups that followed was the Quarrymen, formed in March 1957 by John Lennon. Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;/&quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Style&quot; single was number one in the UK in July 1957, when Lennon first met Paul McCartney. His Skiffle rendition of Hank Snow&#x27;s Country song &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot; was also the inspiration for Tony Sheridan&#x27;s blues version which he recorded with the Beatles as his backing band. 

Donegan went on to successes such as &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; and &quot;Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)&quot;, his biggest hit in the US, on Dot. He turned to music hall style with &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot; which was not well received by skiffle fans and unsuccessful in America on Atlantic in 1960, but it reached number one in the UK. Donegan&#x27;s group had a flexible line-up, but was generally Denny Wright or Les Bennetts, playing lead guitar and singing harmony, Micky Ashman or Pete Huggett—later Steve Jones—on upright bass, Nick Nichols—later Pete Appleby, Mark Goodwin, and Ken Rodway on drums or percussion, and Donegan playing acoustic guitar or banjo and singing the lead.

His last hit single on the UK chart was his cover version of &quot;Pick a Bale of Cotton.&quot; His fall from the chart coincided with the rise of The Beatles and the other beat music performers whom he inspired.

== Later career ==
Donegan recorded sporadically during the 1960s, including sessions at Hickory Records in Nashville with Charlie McCoy, Floyd Cramer, and the Jordanaires. After 1964 he was a record producer for most of the decade at Pye Records. Justin Hayward was one of the artists with whom he worked.

Donegan was not popular through the late 1960s and 1970s (although his &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; was recorded by Tom Jones in 1967 and Elvis Presley in 1976), and he began to play the American cabaret circuit. A departure from his normal style was an a cappella recording of &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;.

Donegan reunited with the original Chris Barber band for a concert in Croydon in June 1975. A bomb scare meant that the recording had to be finished in the studio, after an impromptu concert in the car park. The release was titled &quot;The Great Re-Union Album&quot;. He collaborated with Rory Gallagher on several songs, notably &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; with Gallagher performing most of the elaborate guitar work.

He had his first heart attack in 1976 while in the United States and had quadruple bypass surgery. He returned to attention in 1978 when he recorded his early songs with Rory Gallagher, Ringo Starr, Elton John, and Brian May. The album was called &quot;Putting on the Style&quot;. A follow-up featuring Albert Lee saw Donegan in less familiar country and western vein. By 1980, he was making regular concert appearances again, and another album with Barber followed. In 1983, Donegan toured with Billie Jo Spears, and in 1984 he made his theatrical debut in a revival of the 1920 musical &quot;Mr Cinders&quot;. More concert tours followed, with a move from Florida to Spain. In 1992 he had further bypass surgery following another heart attack.

In 1994, the Chris Barber band celebrated 40 years with a tour with both bands. Pat Halcox was still on trumpet (a position he retained until July 2008). The reunion concert and the tour were on CD and DVD.

Donegan had a late renaissance when in 2000 he appeared on Van Morrison&#x27;s album &quot;The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998&quot;, an acclaimed album featuring him singing with Morrison and Chris Barber, with a guest appearance by Dr John. Donegan also played at the Glastonbury Festival in 1999, and was made an MBE in 2000.

Donegan also appeared at Fairport Convention&#x27;s annual music festival on 9 August 2001. His final CD was &quot;This Yere de Story&quot;.

Peter Donegan started touring as his father&#x27;s pianist when he was aged 18. In 2019, Peter appeared on the show &quot;The Voice&quot; as a contestant, and duetted with Tom Jones with the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;. Anthony Donegan also performs under the name, Lonnie Donegan Jr.

==Personal life==

Donegan married three times. He had two daughters (Fiona and Corrina) with his first wife, Maureen Tyler (divorced 1962), a son and a daughter (Anthony and Juanita) with his second wife, Jill Westlake (divorced 1971), and three sons (Peter, David and Andrew) with his third wife, Sharon whom he married in 1977.

Lonnie Donegan died on 3 November 2002, aged 71, after having a heart attack in Market Deeping, Lincolnshire mid-way through a UK tour, and before he was due to perform at a memorial concert for George Harrison with the Rolling Stones. He had cardiac problems since the 1970s and several heart attacks.

== Legacy ==
Mark Knopfler released a tribute to Lonnie Donegan titled &quot;Donegan&#x27;s Gone&quot; on his 2004 album, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, and said he was one of his greatest influences. Donegan&#x27;s music formed a musical starring his two sons. &quot;Lonnie D – The Musical&quot; took its name from the Chas &amp; Dave tribute song which started the show. Subsequently, Peter Donegan formed a band to perform his father&#x27;s material and has since linked with his father&#x27;s band from the last 30 years with newcomer Eddie Masters on bass. They made an album together in 2009 titled &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;. Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s eldest son, Anthony, also formed his own band, as Lonnie Donegan Junior, who also performed &quot;World Cup Willie&quot; for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

On his album &quot;A Beach Full of Shells&quot;, Al Stewart paid tribute to Donegan in the song &quot;Katherine of Oregon&quot;. In &quot;Class of &#x27;58&quot; he describes a British entertainer who is either Donegan or a composite including him. In a 2023 video interview with Steve Houk, Stewart described &#x27;Rock Island Line&#x27; as a record &quot;that completely changed the complexion of English society, and changed my life and everybody else&#x27;s&quot;. 

Peter Sellers recorded &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Smile&quot; featuring &quot;Lenny Goonagain&quot;, who travels to the &quot;Deep South&quot; of Brighton and finds an &quot;obscure folk song hidden at the top of the American hit parade&quot;, re-records it and reaches number one in the UK.

David Letterman pretended to try to remember Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s name during the Tonight Show conflict between Jay Leno and Conan O&#x27;Brien, calling Fallon &quot;Lonnie Donegan.&quot;

In the 2019 movie &quot;Judy&quot;, the actor John Dagleish portrays Lonnie Donegan, who replaces an ill Judy Garland. He is shown in the (entirely fictional) final scene generously allowing her to make one last appearance on stage.

=== Quotations ===
*&quot;I&#x27;m trying to sing acceptable folk music. I want to widen the audience beyond the artsy-craftsy crowd and the pseudo intellectuals–but without distorting the music itself.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; – June 1956
*&quot;In Britain, we were separated from our folk music tradition centuries ago and were imbued with the idea that music was for the upper classes. You had to be very clever to play music. When I came along with the old three chords, people began to think that if I could do it, so could they. It was the reintroduction of the folk music bridge which did that.&quot; – Interview, 2002.
*&quot;He was the first person we had heard of from Britain to get to the coveted No. 1 in the charts, and we studied his records avidly. We all bought guitars to be in a skiffle group. He was the man.&quot; – Paul McCartney
*&quot;He really was at the very cornerstone of English blues and rock.&quot; – Brian May.
*&quot;I wanted to be Elvis Presley when I grew up, I knew that. But the man who really made me feel like I could actually go out and do it was a chap by the name of Lonnie Donegan.&quot; – Roger Daltrey
*&quot;Remember, Lonnie Donegan started it for you.&quot; – Jack White&#x27;s acceptance speech at the Brit Awards.
* &quot;You know in my little span of life I&#x27;ve come across such a sea of bigotries and prejudices. I get so fed up with it now. I feel I have to do something about it.&quot; - BBC Panorama

<text>Michael Trent Reznor (born May 17, 1965) is an American musician. He came to prominence as the founder, lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and primary songwriter of the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. The band&#x27;s line-up has constantly changed, with Reznor being its only official member from its creation in 1988 until 2016, when he added English musician and frequent collaborator Atticus Ross as its second permanent member.

Reznor began his career in 1982 as a member of synth-pop bands such as The Innocent and Exotic Birds. The first Nine Inch Nails album, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989), was a moderate success but largely remained popular with underground audiences; the next two albums, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Fragile&quot; (1999), brought the band widespread critical acclaim. There have since been eight more Nine Inch Nails albums and six EPs. Reznor has also contributed to the work of artists such as his protégé Marilyn Manson, rapper Saul Williams, and pop singer Halsey. Alongside his wife Mariqueen Maandig and long-time collaborators Atticus Ross and Rob Sheridan, he formed the post-industrial group How to Destroy Angels in 2009.

Since 2010, Reznor and Ross have worked on numerous film and television scores, most notably for movies directed by David Fincher and Luca Guadagnino. These include Fincher&#x27;s &quot;The Social Network&quot; (2010), &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; (2011), and &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), as well as Guadagnino&#x27;s &quot;Bones and All&quot; (2022), &quot;Challengers&quot; (2024), and &quot;Queer&quot; (2024). Reznor and Ross won the Academy Award for Best Original Score and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for both &quot;The Social Network&quot; and &quot;Soul&quot; (2020). They won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series for &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2019). Reznor, Ross, Dave Sitek, and Hudson Mohawke created the virtual supergroup WitchGang in 2023. As Nine Inch Nails, they are creating the soundtrack to &quot;&quot;, to be released in 2025.

==Early life==
Michael Trent Reznor was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on May 17, 1965, the son of Nancy Lou (née Clark) and Michael Reznor. He is of German and Irish descent, and grew up in Mercer. His great-grandfather, George Reznor, founded the heating and air conditioning manufacturer Reznor Company in 1884. After his parents divorced when he was six years old, Reznor&#x27;s sister Tera lived with their mother while he went to live with his maternal grandparents. He began playing the piano at the age of 12 and showed an early aptitude for music. His grandfather told &quot;People&quot; in February 1995, &quot;He was a good kid [...] a Boy Scout who loved to skateboard, build model planes, and play the piano. Music was his life, from the time he was a wee boy. He was so gifted.&quot;

Reznor has acknowledged that his sheltered life left him feeling isolated from the outside world. In a September 1994 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he said of his career choices, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why I want to do these things, other than my desire to escape from Small Town, U.S.A., to dismiss the boundaries, to explore. It isn&#x27;t a bad place where I grew up, but there was nothing going on but the cornfields. My life experience came from watching movies, watching TV and reading books and looking at magazines. And when your culture comes from watching TV every day, you&#x27;re bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities. None of that happened where I was. You&#x27;re almost taught to realize it&#x27;s not for you.&quot; However, in April 1995, he told &quot;Details&quot; that he did not &quot;want to give the impression it was a miserable childhood&quot;.

Reznor would later recall, &quot;The first concert I ever saw was the Eagles in 1976. The excitement of the night struck a chord with me and I remember thinking, &#x27;Someday I&#x27;d love to be up on that stage.&#x27;&quot; At Mercer Area Junior/Senior High School, he learned to play the tenor saxophone and tuba, and was a member of both the jazz band and marching band. The school&#x27;s former band director remembered him as &quot;very upbeat and friendly&quot;. He became involved in theater while in high school, being awarded the &quot;Best in Drama&quot; accolade by his classmates for his roles as Judas in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and Professor Harold Hill in &quot;The Music Man&quot;. He graduated in 1983 and enrolled at Allegheny College in Meadville, where he studied computer engineering.

==Career==
===Early projects===
While still in high school, Reznor joined local band Option 30 and played three shows a week with them. After a year of college, he dropped out to pursue a career in music in Cleveland, Ohio. His first band in Cleveland was the Urge, a cover band. In 1985, he joined The Innocent as a keyboardist; they released one album, &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Street&quot;, but Reznor left the band after three months. In 1986, he joined local band Exotic Birds and appeared with them as a fictional band called The Problems in the 1987 film &quot;Light of Day&quot;. During this time, Reznor also contributed on keyboards to the band Slam Bamboo and briefly joined the new wave band Lucky Pierre.

Reznor got a job at Cleveland&#x27;s Right Track Studio as an assistant engineer and janitor. Studio owner Bart Koster later commented, &quot;He is so focused in everything he does. When that guy waxed the floor, it looked great.&quot; Reznor asked Koster for permission to record demos of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him &quot;just a little wear on [his] tape heads&quot;.

===Nine Inch Nails===
While assembling the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by Prince, he played all the instruments except drums himself. He continued in this role on most Nine Inch Nails studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians, assistants, drummers, and rhythm experts. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material, and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released years later in 1994 as &quot;Purest Feeling&quot; and many of these songs appeared in revised form on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, Reznor&#x27;s first official release under the Nine Inch Nails name.

&quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was released in 1989 and was a moderate commercial success, certified Gold in 1992. Amid pressure from his record label to produce a follow-up to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference, resulting in an EP called &quot;Broken&quot; (1992). Nine Inch Nails was included in the Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991, and won a Grammy Award in 1993 under &quot;Best Heavy Metal Performance&quot; for the song &quot;Wish&quot;.

Nine Inch Nails&#x27; second full-length album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1994 at number two, and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America. To record the album, Reznor rented and moved into the 10050 Cielo Drive mansion, where the Tate–LaBianca murders had been perpetrated by the Manson Family in 1969. He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled on the front door in Sharon Tate&#x27;s blood by her murderers. Reznor told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because he &quot;looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most&quot;. He explained that he was fascinated by the house due to his interest in &quot;American folklore&quot;, but has stated that he does not &quot;want to support serial-killer bullshit.&quot;

Nine Inch Nails toured extensively over the next few years, including a performance at Woodstock &#x27;94, although Reznor admitted to the audience that he did not like to play large venues. Around this time, Reznor&#x27;s studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer&#x27;s block prolonged the production of a follow-up to &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;.

In 1999, the double album &quot;The Fragile&quot; was released. It was partially successful, garnering generally positive critical reception, but lost money for Reznor&#x27;s label, so he funded the North American Fragility Tour out of his own pocket. A further six years followed before the next Nine Inch Nails album &quot;With Teeth&quot; was released. Reznor went into rehab during the time between the two records, and was able to manage his drug addictions. &quot;With Teeth&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After &quot;With Teeth&quot;, Reznor released the concept album &quot;Year Zero&quot; in 2007, which has an alternate reality game themed after the album (see Year Zero (game)) which is about how the current policies of the American government will affect the world in the year 2022. After &quot;Year Zero&quot; release, Reznor broke from large record labels and released two albums, &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; and &quot;The Slip&quot;, independently on his own label, The Null Corporation. In 2009, Nine Inch Nails went on hiatus following the Wave Goodbye Tour. Nine Inch Nails returned to large record labels in 2013, signing with Columbia Records, and releasing the album &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot; that September.

Atticus Ross, a frequent collaborator of Reznor&#x27;s since 2002, was announced as an official member of Nine Inch Nails in 2016 – the first and only other official member of the band besides Reznor himself. With Nine Inch Nails&#x27; new incarnation as a duo, they released a trilogy of EPs from 2016 to 2018, tied together by a loose concept and spanning a wide variety of musical styles. 2016&#x27;s &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot; saw a return to the heavier industrial style of the 1990s, while 2017&#x27;s &quot;Add Violence&quot; instead focused on a more electronic sound and 2018&#x27;s &quot;Bad Witch&quot; ventured into experimental jazz.

===Collaboration with other artists===

One of Reznor&#x27;s earliest collaborations was a Ministry side project in 1990 under the name of 1000 Homo DJs. Reznor sang vocals on a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Supernaut&quot;. Due to legal issues with his label, Reznor&#x27;s vocals had to be distorted to make his voice unrecognizable. The band also recorded additional versions with Al Jourgensen doing vocals. While there is still debate as to which version is Reznor and which is Jourgensen, it has been definitively stated that Reznor&#x27;s vocals were used in the TVT Records&#x27; &quot;Black Box&quot; box set. He also performed with another of Jourgensen&#x27;s side projects, Revolting Cocks, in 1990. He said: &quot;I saw a whole side of humanity that I didn&#x27;t know existed. It was decadence on a new level, but with a sense of humor.&quot;

Reznor sang the vocals on the 1991 Pigface track &quot;Suck&quot; from their first album &quot;Gub&quot;, which also featured production work from Steve Albini. Reznor sang backing vocals on &quot;Past the Mission&quot; on Tori Amos&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Under the Pink&quot;. He produced Marilyn Manson&#x27;s first album, &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; (1994), and several tracks on Manson&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; (1995) and &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996). &quot;I went right into doing a Manson record,&quot; Reznor recalled of the latter, &quot;which was a way of staying on tour, mentally. Every night was some ridiculous scenario. When that finished, I was really in a low emotional place, disillusioned.&quot;

Relations between Reznor and Manson subsequently soured. Manson later said: &quot;I had to make a choice between being friends and having a mediocre career, or breaking things off and continuing to succeed. It got too competitive. And he can&#x27;t expect me not to want to be more successful than him.&quot;

In the video for David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; (1997), Reznor plays a stalker who shows up wherever Bowie goes. In a 2016 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article after Bowie&#x27;s death, Reznor recalled how touring with Bowie in 1995–96 inspired Reznor to stay sober.

Reznor produced a remix of The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s song &quot;Victory&quot;, featuring Busta Rhymes, in 1998. Under the name Tapeworm, Reznor collaborated for nearly 10 years with Danny Lohner, Maynard James Keenan, and Atticus Ross, but the project was eventually terminated before any official material was released. The only known released Tapeworm material is a reworked version of a track called &quot;Vacant&quot; (retitled &quot;Passive&quot;) on A Perfect Circle&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;eMOTIVe&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vacant/Passive&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a track &quot;Potions (Deliverance Mix)&quot; on Puscifer&#x27;s 2009 remix EP.

In 2006, Reznor played his first &quot;solo&quot; shows at Neil Young&#x27;s annual Bridge School Benefit. Backed by a four piece string section, he performed stripped-down versions of many Nine Inch Nails songs. Reznor featured on El-P&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, providing guest vocals on &quot;Flyentology&quot;. Reznor co-produced Saul Williams&#x27; 2007 album &quot;The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!&quot; after Williams toured with Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and 2006. Reznor convinced Williams to release the album as a free download, while giving fans the option of paying $5 for higher quality files, or downloading all of the songs at a lower quality for free. Reznor was also credited as &quot;Musical Consultant&quot; on the 2004 film &quot;Man on Fire&quot;. The movie features six Nine Inch Nails songs.

Reznor produced songs for Jane&#x27;s Addiction at his home studio in Beverly Hills, California. The first recordings (new versions of the early tracks &quot;Chip Away&quot; and &quot;Whores&quot;) were released simultaneously on Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s website and the NINJA 2009 Tour Sampler digital EP.

In November 2012, Reznor revealed on Reddit that he would be working with Queens of the Stone Age on a song for their sixth studio album, &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;. He had worked with the band once before, providing backing vocals on the title track of the 2007 album &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;. Josh Homme has since revealed that Reznor was originally meant to produce the album.

In January 2013, Reznor appeared in a documentary entitled &quot;Sound City&quot;, directed by former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl. &quot;Sound City&quot; is based on real-life recording studio Sound City Studios, originating in Van Nuys, California. It has housed the works of some of the most famed names in music history since its founding in 1969. The film was chosen as an official selection for the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was available to download from its official website on February 1, 2013. Reznor also contributed to the soundtrack for the film, on the track &quot;Mantra&quot;, along with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme.

Reznor appeared in a live performance with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Lindsey Buckingham, Dave Grohl, and Queens of the Stone Age at the 2014 Grammy Award ceremony. In an interview with a New Zealand media outlet, Reznor explained his thought process at the time that he was considering his participation in the performance:

In 2019, Reznor received a songwriting credit on the Lil Nas X song &quot;Old Town Road&quot;, due to the song heavily sampling the 2008 Nine Inch Nails instrumental track &quot;34 Ghosts IV&quot;. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 2019, with Reznor and Ross both receiving songwriting and production credit. The song would go on to become the chart&#x27;s longest-running #1 hit, staying at the top for a record 19 weeks. Reznor gave clearance for the use of the sample and expressed support for the song, but declined an invitation to appear in the music video.

In 2020, Reznor collaborated with Tobacco on his fifth studio album &quot;Hot Wet and Sassy&quot; on the song &quot;Baby Sitter&quot; after they had previously toured together in 2017.

In 2021, it was that revealed Reznor and Atticus Ross would be producing Halsey&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have Love, I Want Power&quot;. The album was released on August 27, 2021. Reznor and Ross recorded instrumentation and produced the album from a studio in Los Angeles, while Halsey sang at a studio in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The album, which largely abandoned Halsey&#x27;s usual pop style for a heavier industrial approach, received critical acclaim.

In 2023, Reznor and Ross joined Dave Sitek and Hudson Mohawke to create the virtual supergroup WitchGang. The group&#x27;s song, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Alright&quot;, was released in December.

===How to Destroy Angels===
In April 2010, it was announced that Reznor had formed a new band with his wife, Mariqueen Maandig, and Atticus Ross, called How to Destroy Angels. The group digitally released a self-titled six song EP on June 1, 2010, with the retail edition becoming available on July 6, 2010. They covered the Bryan Ferry song &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough?&quot; for the soundtrack for &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, which was released on December 9, 2011.

On September 21, 2012, Reznor announced that the group&#x27;s next release would be an EP entitled &quot;An Omen EP&quot;, set for release on Columbia Records in November 2012, and that some of the EP&#x27;s songs would later appear on the band&#x27;s first full-length album in 2013. On October 8, 2012, they released a song and music video from &quot;An Omen EP&quot; entitled &quot;Keep it Together&quot;. How to Destroy Angels announced in January 2013 that their first full-length album entitled &quot;Welcome Oblivion&quot; would be released on March 5 of the same year.

===As an independent artist===

Following the release of &quot;Year Zero&quot;, Reznor announced later that Nine Inch Nails had split from its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major albums independently. In May 2008 Reznor founded The Null Corporation and Nine Inch Nails released the studio album &quot;The Slip&quot; as a free digital download. In his appreciation for his following and fan base, and having no contractual obligation, he made &quot;The Slip&quot; available for free on his website, stating &quot;This one&#x27;s on me.&quot; A month and a half after its online release, &quot;The Slip&quot; had been downloaded 1.4 million times from the official Nine Inch Nails website.

In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on NIN.com, stating that &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking for some time now it&#x27;s time to make NIN disappear for a while.&quot; Reznor noted in an interview on the official website that while he has not stopped creating music as Nine Inch Nails, the group will not be touring in the foreseeable future.

====Video games====
The original music from id Software&#x27;s 1996 video game &quot;Quake&quot; is credited to &quot;Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails&quot;; Reznor helped record sound effects and ambient audio, and the NIN logo appears on the nailgun ammunition boxes in the game. Reznor&#x27;s association with id Software began with Reznor being a fan of the original &quot;Doom&quot;. He reunited with id Software in 2003 as the sound engineer for &quot;Doom 3&quot;, though due to &quot;time, money and bad management&quot;, he had to abandon the project, and his audio work did not make it into the game&#x27;s final release.

Nine Inch Nails&#x27; 2007 major studio recording, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, was released alongside an accompanying alternate reality game. With its lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Reznor described &quot;Year Zero&quot; as a concept album criticizing the United States government&#x27;s current policies and how they will affect the world 15 years in the future. In July 2012, it was announced that Reznor had composed and performed the theme music for &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;.

In December 2024, it was announced that Reznor and Ross would score &quot;&quot;.

====Film composition====
In 1994, Reznor produced the soundtrack for Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, using a portable Pro Tools setup in his hotel room. For the film, Nine Inch Nails recorded a song &quot;Burn&quot;. For &quot;The Crow&quot; soundtrack, the group recorded a cover version of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;.

Reznor produced the soundtrack for David Lynch&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. He produced two pieces of the film&#x27;s score, &quot;Driver Down&quot; and &quot;Videodrones; Questions&quot;, with Peter Christopherson. He tried to get Coil onto the soundtrack, but couldn&#x27;t convince Lynch. Nine Inch Nails recorded a song, &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; for the soundtrack. The release spawned a single, a music video directed by Mark Romanek.

In 2001, Reznor was asked by Romanek to provide the score for &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;, but the music did not work for the film and was not used. These compositions eventually evolved into &quot;Still&quot;. A remix of the Nine Inch Nails track &quot;You Know What You Are?&quot; by Clint Mansell was used as part of the latter&#x27;s soundtrack to the 2005 film adaptation of &quot;Doom&quot;. In 2009, Trent Reznor composed &quot;Theme for Tetsuo&quot; for the Japanese cyberpunk film &quot;&quot; directed by Shinya Tsukamoto.

Reznor collaborated with Ross to compose the score for David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;The Social Network&quot;, a 2010 drama film about the founding of Facebook. Says Reznor, &quot;When I actually read the script and realized what he was up to, I said goodbye to that free time I had planned.&quot; The score was noted for portraying &quot;Mark Zuckerberg the genius, developing a brilliant idea over ominous undertones,&quot; and received nearly unanimous praise. The film&#x27;s score was released in October 2010 in multiple formats, including digital download, compact disc, 5.1 surround on Blu-ray, and vinyl record. A 5-song sampler EP was released for free via digital download.

On January 7, 2011, Reznor announced that he would again be working with Fincher, this time to provide the score for the American adaptation of &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. A cover of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; by Led Zeppelin, produced by Reznor and Ross, with Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) as the featured singer, accompanied a trailer for the film. Reznor and Ross&#x27; second collaboration with Fincher was scored as the film was shot, based on the concept of &quot;what if we give you music the minute you start to edit stuff together?&quot; Reznor explained in 2014 that the composition process was &quot;a lot more work&quot; and that he &quot;would be hesitant to go as far in that direction in the future&quot;.

Reznor and Ross again collaborated to score Fincher&#x27;s film &quot;Gone Girl&quot;. Fincher was inspired by music he heard while at an appointment with a chiropractor and tasked Reznor with creating the musical equivalent of an insincere façade. Reznor explained Fincher&#x27;s request in an interview: &quot;David [Fincher] was at the chiropractor and heard this music that was inauthentically trying to make him feel OK, and that became a perfect metaphor for this film. [...] The challenge was, simply, what is the musical equivalent of the same sort of façade of comfort and a feeling of insincerity that that music represented? [My primary aim was] to instill doubt [and] remind you that things aren&#x27;t always what they seem to be.&quot; Richard Butler of The Psychedelic Furs sang a cover version of the song &quot;She,&quot; which was used in the film&#x27;s teaser trailer. The soundtrack album was released on the Columbia label on September 30, 2014.

During Reznor and Ross&#x27; keynote session at the 2014 &quot;Billboard and Hollywood Reporter Film &amp; TV Music Conference&quot;, held on November 5, Reznor said that he is open to working with other filmmakers besides Fincher, the only director he had worked with as a composer up until that point: &quot;I&#x27;m open to any possibility. [...] Scoring for film kind of came up unexpectedly. It was always something I&#x27;d been interested in and it was really a great experience and I&#x27;ve learned a lot.&quot; Reznor further explained that he cherishes his previous experiences with Fincher as &quot;there&#x27;s a pursuit and dedication to uncompromised excellence&quot;.

In December 2014, it was announced that Reznor would collaborate with composer Mike Patton, best known as the frontman of alternative metal band Faith No More, on &quot;The Girl Who Played With Fire&quot; by Fincher, the sequel to 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. However, after the release of the 2015 book &quot;The Girl in the Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, a part of the series from which the films are based, Sony decided to reboot the franchise and cancelled this production.

Reznor and Ross have gone on to score films by a number of other directors, starting in 2016 with Fisher Stevens&#x27; climate change documentary &quot;Before the Flood&quot; (whose score also included compositions by Gustavo Santaolalla and Mogwai) and Peter Berg&#x27;s &quot;Patriots Day&quot;, a crime drama about the Boston Marathon bombings. The following year, they made their television debut with the score for Ken Burns and Lynn Novick&#x27;s documentary series &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;. In 2018, Reznor and Ross scored Jonah Hill&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Mid90s&quot;, as well as Susanne Bier&#x27;s &quot;Bird Box&quot;, which was released on Netflix. Reznor and Ross also released a 2-hour box set for the &quot;Bird Box&quot; soundtrack containing additional material from their recording sessions, titled &quot;Bird Box/Null 09 Extended&quot;. Reznor later admitted his dissatisfaction with working on &quot;Bird Box&quot; during an interview for the December 2019 edition of &quot;Revolver&quot;, calling the experience a &quot;fucking waste of time&quot;. He criticized the film&#x27;s editing department for mixing the score too low in the final cut of the film, as well as the production team overall for &quot;phoning in&quot; the project. Reznor also revealed that he and Ross pulled out of scoring Joe Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;, having scrapped their completed score due to displeasure with the studio&#x27;s &quot;transformation&quot; of the film following test screenings. The film was ultimately sold to Netflix and released in 2021, with Danny Elfman replacing Reznor and Ross as composer.

In 2019, Reznor and Ross composed the score for the independent drama &quot;Waves&quot;, and later that year made their second contribution to television with their score for Damon Lindelof&#x27;s HBO miniseries &quot;Watchmen&quot;, a sequel to Alan Moore&#x27;s original 1987 comic series. Reznor and Ross, both fans of the comic, approached Lindelof to work on the series, and released three volumes of music from the series over the course of its broadcast. The score was critically acclaimed, and Reznor and Ross won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series in 2020.

In 2020, Reznor and Ross reunited with Fincher to score his drama film &quot;Mank&quot; as well as scoring their first animated project, Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Soul&quot;. In 2021, the two won a Golden Globe and an Academy Award alongside Jon Batiste for their work on the &quot;Soul&quot; score.

In 2022, Reznor and Ross scored Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s &quot;Bones and All&quot;, as well as Sam Mendes&#x27; &quot;Empire of Light&quot;. In 2023, the duo scored their second animated project, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, and reunited with Fincher for &quot;The Killer&quot;. In 2024, Reznor and Ross scored two films by Guadagnino: &quot;Challengers,&quot; and &quot;Queer&quot;. The two also composed the title theme for the HBO comedy series &quot;The Franchise&quot;; Mendes served as executive producer on the project, and directed the pilot.

As Nine Inch Nails, Reznor and Ross are composing the score to the sci-fi sequel &quot;&quot;, due to be released in 2025. The two are also scoring Scott Derrickson&#x27;s &quot;The Gorge&quot;, which is set to release on Apple TV+ the same year, as well as Guadagnino&#x27;s thriller &quot;After the Hunt&quot;.

==Business activity==
===Dispute with John Malm===
In 2004, Reznor&#x27;s former manager John Malm Jr. filed a suit against Reznor for over $2 million (~$ in ) in deferred commissions. The suit alleged that Reznor &quot;reneged on every single contract he and Malm ever entered into&quot; and that Reznor refused to pay Malm money to which he was contractually entitled.
Weeks later, Reznor filed a counter-suit in the U.S. District Court of New York, charging Malm with fraud and breach of fiduciary duties. Reznor&#x27;s suit arose from a five-year management contract signed in the early days of Nine Inch Nails, between Reznor and Malm&#x27;s management company J. Artist Management. This contract, according to the suit, was unlawful and immoral in that it secured Malm 20% of Reznor&#x27;s &quot;gross&quot; earnings, rather than his &quot;net&quot; earnings, as is the standard practice between artists and their management. The suit also alleged that the contract secured this percentage even if Malm was no longer representing Reznor, and for all Reznor&#x27;s album advances. The suit also described how Malm had misappropriated the ownership rights regarding Nine Inch Nails, including the trademark name &quot;NIИ&quot;. According to testimony by Malm, Reznor gave him half of the &quot;NIИ&quot; trademark &quot;as a gift&quot;.

Reznor stated that he began to fully understand his financial situation after tackling his drug addiction. Reznor requested a financial statement from Malm in 2003, only to discover that he had only $400,000 (~$ in ) in liquid assets. He told the court, &quot;It was not pleasant discovering you have a tenth as much as you&#x27;ve been told you have.&quot; Malm&#x27;s lawyers, however, claimed that Malm had worked for years &quot;pro bono&quot;, and that Reznor&#x27;s inability to release an album or tour and his uninhibited spending were the reasons for Reznor&#x27;s financial situation. After a three-week trial in 2005, jurors sided with Reznor, awarding him upwards of $2.95 million and returning to him complete control of his trademarks. After adjustment for inflation, Reznor&#x27;s award rose to nearly $5 million.

=== Beats Music ===
In January 2013, Reznor and TopSpin Media founder Ian Rogers were chosen to head Beats Electronics&#x27; new music subscription service, Project Daisy, described by Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine as having &quot;hardware, brand, distribution partnerships, and artist relations to differentiate Daisy from the competition&quot;. There was some speculation as to what Reznor&#x27;s role would be within the company, but he was later named chief creative officer. He promised that he and the other members would strive to create a music subscription service that will be like &quot;having your own guy when you go to the record store, who knows what you like but can also point you down some paths you wouldn&#x27;t have necessarily encountered&quot;. The service was officially launched in the United States on January 21, 2014.

Reznor continued on in a similar role under Beats&#x27; new ownership at Apple, where he was involved in the launch of Apple Music. He later left Apple, noting working there &quot;felt at odds with the artist in me.&quot;

==Criticism of the music industry==

In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning Universal Music Group—the parent company of the band&#x27;s record label, Interscope Records—for their pricing and distribution plans for Nine Inch Nails&#x27; 2007 album &quot;Year Zero&quot;. He labeled the company&#x27;s retail pricing of &quot;Year Zero&quot; in Australia as &quot;ABSURD,&quot; concluding that &quot;as a reward for being a &#x27;true fan&#x27; you get ripped off&quot;. Reznor went on to say that as &quot;the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more.&quot; Reznor&#x27;s post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on Universal Music Group at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to &quot;steal&quot; his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to &quot;steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin&#x27;.&quot;

While on tour in Prague in 2009, Reznor considered the marketing aspect of a major label when he saw a lot of promotion for Radiohead&#x27;s then-upcoming tour, contrasting with little promotion for his current Nine Inch Nails tour or any of its recently released albums. At a 2012 panel discussion with David Byrne and Josh Kun, Reznor stated that the marketing from a major label outweighed the aspects of being independent that he liked, namely the ability to release albums whenever he wanted to avoid leaking and to take a larger cut of the profits from record sales. Reznor&#x27;s first album released through a major label after his return was How to Destroy Angels&#x27; &quot;An Omen EP&quot; released in November 2012 through Columbia Records. On working with Columbia for the release of the EP, Reznor said that &quot;so far it&#x27;s been pleasantly pleasant&quot;.

In 2013, Reznor returned to Columbia Records for &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;, the eighth Nine Inch Nails studio album. On the Columbia release of &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;, Reznor has stated: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to make the best thing I can make... and I also want as many people as possible to be aware that it&#x27;s out there.&quot;

== Influences and musical style ==
Reznor possesses a baritone vocal range. Reznor was initially inspired to create music after seeing the Eagles perform in 1976. He would later recall, &quot;The excitement of the night struck a chord with me and I remember thinking, &#x27;Someday I&#x27;d love to be up on that stage.&#x27;&quot; Another early influence was English musician Gary Numan, with Reznor once saying that he knew he wanted to make music with synthesizers after hearing Numan&#x27;s song &quot;Cars&quot;. This was exemplified years later on the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Only&quot; of 2005, whose disco-style beats and synthesizers draw from Numan&#x27;s style. Reznor mentioned that college radio introduced him to acts such as the English gothic rock band Bauhaus (naming their lead singer, Peter Murphy, as one of his idols), as well as the English bands Joy Division and Throbbing Gristle, which were very inspirational for him. Reznor also said he saw the first Nine Inch Nails song he wrote, &quot;Down in It&quot;, as a &quot;total rip-off&quot; of the 1986 song &quot;Dig It&quot; by Canadian band Skinny Puppy.

Reznor&#x27;s work was described by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1995 as &quot;self-loathing, sexual obsession, torture and suicide over a thick sludge of gnashing guitars and computer-synthesized beats&quot;. The magazine also said that &quot;[Reznor], like Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne before him, has built his name on theatrics and nihilism&quot;. Nine Inch Nails concerts were often picketed by fundamentalist Christians. Despite the gloomy public image that surrounded Reznor from then on, his former high school band director considered him to be &quot;very upbeat and friendly&quot; in reality and theorized that &quot;all that &#x27;dark avenging angel&#x27; stuff is marketing&quot;. Conversely, the owner of the recording studio where Reznor recorded the album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; said of Reznor&#x27;s &quot;pain-driven&quot; stage act, &quot;It&#x27;s planned, but it is not contrived. He&#x27;s pulling that stuff out from inside somewhere. You cannot fake that delivery.&quot; Pain and sorrow came to be regarded as such defining elements of Reznor&#x27;s music that a group of fans once responded to the news that his dog had died with comments like &quot;it&#x27;s good for his music when he is depressed&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s good to see [Reznor] back in Hell, where he belongs&quot;.

Reznor expressed the significant influence that English experimental band Coil had on his work, saying that their 1986 album &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; was &quot;deeply influential&quot;. In many interviews, he has also mentioned important influences on him from American, English, Irish, and Scottish acts such as Devo, The Cars, The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Pere Ubu, Soft Cell, Prince, Ministry, Test Dept, Cabaret Voltaire and The Cure&#x27;s 1985 album, &quot;The Head on the Door&quot;. According to American musician Todd Rundgren, Reznor told him that he listened to Rundgren&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; with &quot;great regularity&quot;.

Reznor also cited English band Depeche Mode, in particular their 1986 album &quot;Black Celebration&quot;, as a major influence on his beginnings. In 2017, he recalled:

A longtime fan of English musician David Bowie, Reznor has ranked Bowie&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Low&quot; as one of his favorite albums and said that he listened to it constantly during the recording of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; for inspiration. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails toured as a co-headlining act on the North American leg of Bowie&#x27;s 1995 Outside Tour. Reznor also appeared in Bowie&#x27;s video for &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s stalker, and made several remixes for the single release of the song (as well as a remix of &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;). The two came to consider each other friends. In &quot;&quot; Reznor said that Canadian band Rush had played a major part in his childhood, that he considered Rush to be &quot;one of the best bands ever&quot; and that he had gained a perspective on how keyboards could be introduced into hard rock after listening to their 1982 album &quot;Signals&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Reznor&#x27;s work as Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from &quot;generic imitations&quot; dating from the band&#x27;s initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a &quot;truer, less imitative way&quot;. Following the release of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; influence: David Bowie compared NIN&#x27;s impact to that of The Velvet Underground. In 1997, Reznor appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the year&#x27;s most influential people, and &quot;Spin&quot; magazine described him as &quot;the most vital artist in music&quot;. Bob Ezrin, producer for Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Peter Gabriel, described Reznor in 2007 as a &quot;true visionary&quot; and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude. During an appearance at the &quot;Kerrang! Awards&quot; in London that year, Reznor accepted the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Icon, honoring Nine Inch Nails&#x27; long-standing influence on rock music.

Guns N&#x27; Roses frontman Axl Rose, an early supporter of Nine Inch Nails, was heavily influenced by Reznor in the writing and composition of the band&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; album. Steven Wilson of progressive rock band Porcupine Tree has stated that he is influenced by and much admires Reznor&#x27;s production work, in particular &quot;The Fragile&quot;, and in 2008 said that &quot;[Reznor] is the only one [he&#x27;d] let near [his] music&quot;. 
Indonesian singer Anggun said that Reznor was &quot;the man of my musical life&quot;, and that &quot;The Fragile&quot; was &quot;the album that changed my life.&quot;
Writing for &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine on the 25th anniversary of &quot;Broken&quot;, musician Greg Puciato stated that one of the few vivid musical memories of his teenage years was listening to the EP at age 12, front-to-back, in the first digipak he had seen. Later, after discovering the story behind its release, it became a giant influence on him, particularly &quot;when it comes to [his] own artistic path or output&quot;. Timbaland has cited Reznor as his favorite studio producer. Drummer Chris Pennie of the Dillinger Escape Plan said &quot;The Fragile&quot; changed his compositional mindset from drums to production, as he was &quot;blown away&quot; by its dense yet elegant mix and vocal ideas. He called it one of his two favorite albums of all time.

==Personal life==
During the five years following the release of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; in 1994, Reznor suffered from depression; his condition was worsened by the death of his maternal grandmother, who had raised him. He began abusing alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs, and successfully completed rehab in 2001. He said in a 2005 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; interview, &quot;There was a persona that had run its course. I needed to get my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I took a couple of years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened.&quot; In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he stated in another 2005 interview that he is &quot;pretty happy&quot;.

Reznor married Filipino-American singer Mariqueen Maandig in October 2009. They live in Los Angeles and have five children together. When asked about the future of Nine Inch Nails in 2023, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be away from my kids. I don&#x27;t want to miss their lives to go do a thing that I&#x27;m grateful to be able to do, and I&#x27;m appreciative that you&#x27;re here to see it, but I&#x27;ve done it a lot, you know? I don&#x27;t really want to do that right now. [...] I kind of want to feel okay and I want to make sure my family’s okay.&quot; He added that he prefers working on film scores over recording and touring as Nine Inch Nails in part because there is a &quot;less fertile environment&quot; to put Nine Inch Nails music out into, while scoring for films has &quot;thrust [him] into places [he] wouldn&#x27;t be&quot; with the band.

== Awards and nominations ==

In 2011, Reznor and Ross won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score for their work on &quot;The Social Network&quot;.

For their work on &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, Reznor and Ross were nominated for the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Neither man was present to accept the award; Reznor, who has a contentious history with the Grammys, simply tweeted, &quot;Why thanks, y&#x27;all.&quot;

Ross and Reznor&#x27;s &quot;Gone Girl&quot; score was nominated for Best Original Score in a Feature Film at the 5th Hollywood Music in Media Awards (HMMA)—the award was eventually won by Antonio Sanchez for &quot;Birdman&quot; on November 4, 2014. In a November 2014 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Reznor revealed that he values Oscar trophies above Grammy awards: &quot;When the Oscar [nomination] came up, it felt very different. I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older or it felt like it&#x27;s coming from a more sincere pedigree.&quot;

Reznor and Ross won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series and were nominated for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for their work on the series &quot;Watchmen&quot;. In 2021, they won their second Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score (this time shared with Jon Batiste) and second Academy Award for Best Original Score, both for the Pixar film &quot;Soul&quot;. In 2025, Reznor and Ross won a third Golden Globe for Best Original Score, for their work in &quot;Challengers&quot; (2024).

<doc id="144043" wikidata="Q234185" url="?curid=144043" title="Alice Liddell">
<text>Alice Pleasance Hargreaves (&quot;née&quot; Liddell, ; 4 May 1852 – 16 November 1934) was an English woman who, in her childhood, was an acquaintance and photography subject of Lewis Carroll. One of the stories he told her during a boating trip became the classic 1865 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. She shared her name with &quot;Alice&quot;, the story&#x27;s protagonist, but scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.

==Early life==
Alice Liddell was the fourth of the ten children of Henry Liddell, ecclesiastical dean of Christ Church, Oxford, one of the editors of &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;, and his wife Lorina Hanna Liddell (&quot;née&quot; Reeve). She had two older brothers, Harry (born 1847) and Arthur (1850–53), an older sister Lorina (born 1849), and six younger siblings, including her sister Edith (born 1854) to whom she was very close, and her brother Frederick (born 1865).

At the time of her birth, her father was the Headmaster of Westminster School but was soon after appointed to the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. The Liddell family moved to Oxford in 1856. Soon after this move, Alice met Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), who encountered the family while photographing the cathedral on 25 April 1856. He became a close friend of the Liddell family in subsequent years.

Alice was three years younger than Lorina and two years older than Edith, and the three sisters were constant childhood companions. She and her family regularly spent holidays at their holiday home Penmorfa, which later became the Gogarth Abbey Hotel, on the West Shore of Llandudno in North Wales.
When Alice Liddell was a young woman, she set out on a Grand Tour of Europe with Lorina and Edith. One story has it that she became a romantic interest of Prince Leopold, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, during the four years he spent at Christ Church, but the evidence for this is sparse. It is true that years later, Leopold named his first child Alice and acted as godfather to Alice&#x27;s second son Leopold. However, it is possible Alice was named in honour of Leopold&#x27;s deceased elder sister instead, the Grand Duchess of Hesse. A recent biographer of Leopold suggests it is far more likely that Alice&#x27;s sister Edith was the true recipient of Leopold&#x27;s attention. Edith died on 26 June 1876, possibly of measles or peritonitis (accounts differ), shortly before she was to be married to Aubrey Harcourt, a cricket player. Prince Leopold served as a pall-bearer at her funeral on 30 June 1876.

==Later life==

Alice Liddell married Reginald Hargreaves, also a cricketer, on 15 September 1880, at the age of 28 in Westminster Abbey. They had three sons: Alan Knyveton Hargreaves and Leopold Reginald &quot;Rex&quot; Hargreaves (both were killed in action in World War I); and Caryl Liddell Hargreaves, who survived to have a daughter of his own. Liddell denied that the name &#x27;Caryl&#x27; was in any way associated with Charles Dodgson&#x27;s pseudonym. Reginald Hargreaves inherited a considerable fortune, and was a local magistrate; he also played cricket for Hampshire. Alice became a noted society hostess and was the first president of Emery Down Women&#x27;s Institute.

During World War I, she joined the Red Cross as a volunteer, for which she was awarded a medal currently on display in the Museum of Oxford. 

She took to referring to herself as &quot;Lady Hargreaves&quot;, but no basis existed for such a title. After her husband’s death in 1926, the cost of maintaining their home, Cuffnells, was such that she deemed it necessary to sell her copy of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures under Ground&quot; (Lewis Carroll&#x27;s earlier title for &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;). The manuscript fetched £15,400 (), nearly four times the reserve price given to it by Sotheby&#x27;s auction house. It later became the possession of Eldridge R. Johnson and was displayed at Columbia University on the centennial of Carroll&#x27;s birth. Alice was present, aged 80, and it was on this visit to the United States that she met Peter Llewelyn Davies, one of the brothers who inspired J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Upon Johnson&#x27;s death, the book was purchased by a consortium of American bibliophiles and presented to the British people &quot;in recognition of Britain&#x27;s courage in facing Hitler&quot;. The manuscript is held by the British Library.

For most of her life, Alice lived in and around Lyndhurst in the New Forest, in the county of Hampshire.

==Death==

After she died in 1934, her body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, with her ashes being buried in the graveyard of the church of St Michael and All Angels in Lyndhurst, Hampshire. Alice&#x27;s mirror can be found on display at the New Forest Heritage Centre, Lyndhurst, a free museum sharing the history of the New Forest National Park.

==Origin of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;==

On 4 July 1862, in a rowing boat travelling on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow for a picnic outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson to write it down for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot; in November 1864.
In the meantime, Dodgson had decided to rewrite the story as a possible commercial venture. Probably with a view to canvassing his opinion, Dodgson sent the manuscript of &quot;Under Ground&quot; to a friend, the author George MacDonald, in the spring of 1863. The MacDonald children read the story and loved it, and this response probably persuaded Dodgson to seek a publisher. &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, with illustrations by John Tenniel, was published in 1865, under the name Lewis Carroll. A second book about the character Alice, &quot;Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There&quot;, followed in 1871. In 1886, a facsimile of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot;, the original manuscript that Dodgson had given Liddell, was published.

== Relationship with Lewis Carroll ==
The relationship between Liddell and Dodgson has been the source of much controversy. Dodgson met the Liddell family in 1855; he first befriended Harry, the older brother, and later took Harry and Ina on several boating trips and picnics to the scenic areas around Oxford. Later, when Harry went to school, Alice and her younger sister Edith joined the party. Dodgson entertained the children by telling them fantastic stories to while away the time. He also used them as subjects for his hobby, photography. It has often been stated that Alice was his favourite subject in these years, but there is very little evidence to suggest this; Dodgson&#x27;s diaries from 18 April 1858 to 8 May 1862 are missing.

===&quot;Cut pages in diary&quot;===

The relationship between the Liddells and Dodgson suffered a sudden break in June 1863. There was no record of why the rift occurred, since the Liddells never openly spoke of it, and the single page in Dodgson&#x27;s diary recording 27–29 June 1863 (which seems to cover the period in which it began) was missing; it has been speculated by biographers such as Morton N. Cohen that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained break with the family in June 1863. Alice Liddell&#x27;s biographer, Anne Clark, writes that Alice&#x27;s descendants were under the impression that Dodgson wanted to marry her, but that &quot;Alice&#x27;s parents expected a much better match for her.&quot; Clark argues that in Victorian England such arrangements were not as improbable as they might seem; John Ruskin, for example, fell in love with a 12-year-old girl while Dodgson&#x27;s younger brother sought to marry a 14-year-old, but postponed the wedding for six years.

In 1996, Karoline Leach found what became known as the &quot;Cut pages in diary&quot; document—a note allegedly written by Charles Dodgson&#x27;s niece, Violet Dodgson, summarising the missing page from 27–29 June 1863, apparently written before she (or her sister Menella) removed the page. The note reads:

This might imply that the break between Dodgson and the Liddell family was caused by concern over alleged gossip linking Dodgson to the family governess and to &quot;Ina&quot; (both Alice&#x27;s older sister and her mother were named &quot;Lorina&quot;). In her biography, &quot;The Mystery of Lewis Carroll,&quot; Jenny Woolf suggests that the problem was caused by Lorina becoming too attached to Dodgson and not the other way around. Woolf then uses this theory to explain why &quot;Menella [would] &quot;remove the page itself, yet keep a note of what was on it.&quot;&quot; The note, she submits, is a &quot;censored version&quot; of what really happened, intended to prevent Lorina from being offended or humiliated at having her feelings for Dodgson made public.

It is uncertain who wrote the note. Leach has said that the handwriting on the front of the document most closely resembles that of either Menella or Violet Dodgson, Dodgson&#x27;s nieces. However, Morton N. Cohen in an article published in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; in 2003 said that in the 1960s, Dodgson&#x27;s great-nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques told him that Jacques had written the note himself based on conversations he remembered with Dodgson&#x27;s nieces. Cohen&#x27;s article offered no evidence to support this, however, and known samples of Jacques&#x27; handwriting do not seem to resemble the writing of the note.

After this incident, Dodgson avoided the Liddell home for six months but eventually returned for a visit in December 1863. However, the former closeness does not seem to have been re-established, and the friendship gradually faded away, possibly because Dodgson was in opposition to Dean Liddell over college politics.

==Comparison with fictional Alice==
The extent to which Dodgson&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; may be or could be identified with Liddell is controversial. The two Alices are clearly not identical, and though it was long assumed that the fictional Alice was based very heavily on Liddell, recent research has contradicted this assumption. Dodgson himself claimed in later years that his Alice was entirely imaginary and not based upon any real child at all.

There was a rumour that Dodgson sent Tenniel a photo of one of his other child-friends, Mary Hilton Badcock, suggesting that he use her as a model, but attempts to find documentary support for this theory have proved fruitless. Dodgson&#x27;s own drawings of the character in the original manuscript of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot; show little resemblance to Liddell. Biographer Anne Clark suggests that Dodgson might have used Edith Liddell as a model for his drawings.

There are at least four direct links to Liddell in the two books. First, he set them on 4 May (Liddell&#x27;s birthday) and 4 November (her &quot;half-birthday&quot;), and in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; the fictional Alice declares that her age is &quot;seven and a half exactly&quot;, the same as Liddell on that date. Second, he dedicated them &quot;to Alice Pleasance Liddell&quot;. Third, in the first book, the Dormouse tells a story which begins, &quot;Once upon a time there were three little sisters... and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie.&quot; The name Liddell was pronounced with the accent on the first syllable and would sound like &quot;little&quot; as spoken with the &quot;T&quot; sound softened. Also the name &quot;Lacie&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Alice&quot;, while &#x27;Elsie&#x27; refers to Lorina, whose second name was Charlotte, giving her the initials L.C. &#x27;Tillie&#x27; refers to Edith&#x27;s family nickname of &#x27;Matilda&#x27;.

Fourth, there is an acrostic poem at the end of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. Reading downward, taking the first letter of each line, spells out Liddell&#x27;s full name. The poem has no title in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, but is usually referred to by its first line, &quot;A Boat Beneath a Sunny Sky&quot;.

A boat beneath a sunny sky,
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of July—

Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear,
Pleased a simple tale to hear—

Long has paled that sunny sky:
Echoes fade and memories die.
Autumn frosts have slain July.

Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
Alice moving under skies
Never seen by waking eyes.

Children yet, the tale to hear,
Eager eye and willing ear,
Lovingly shall nestle near.

In a Wonderland they lie,
Dreaming as the days go by,
Dreaming as the summers die:

Ever drifting down the stream—
Lingering in the golden gleam—
Life, what is it but a dream?

In addition, all of those who participated in the Thames boating expedition where the story was originally told (Carroll, Duckworth and the three Liddell sisters) appear in the chapter &quot;A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale&quot; – but only if Alice Liddell is represented by Alice herself.

==Alice Liddell in other works==
Several later writers have written fictional accounts of Liddell:
* Liddell is the main character of Melanie Benjamin&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice I Have Been&quot;, a fictional account of Alice&#x27;s life from childhood through old age, focusing on her relationship with Lewis Carroll and the impact that &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot; had on her.
*The Real Alice in Wonderland, a children&#x27;s book by Cathy Rubin, writing as C. M. Rubin. &quot;The Real Alice in Wonderland: A Role Model for All Ages&quot;, was Written with Rubin&#x27;s daughter Gabriella. Alice Liddell, was the aunt of one of Rubin&#x27;s great-aunts. Rubin was born in Georgetown, Guyana. She grew up all over the world, living in United States, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. She worked as a marketing executive with EMI films and RCA/Columbia Pictures Video in Britain. She also wrote &quot;Let&#x27;s Buy Hollywood&quot; (1992), a board game based on the entertainment industry, developed with her husband Harry M. Rubin, and &quot;Eleanor, Ellatony, Ellencake and Me&quot; and &quot;Ellie: The Perfect Dress for Me&quot;.
* Alice Liddell is the main character of Michelle Rene&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Dodo Knight&quot;, a fictional account of Liddell&#x27;s life, focusing on her friendship with Charles Dodgson.
* She is one of the main characters of the &quot;Riverworld&quot; series of books by Philip José Farmer.
* She plays a small but critical role in Lewis Padgett&#x27;s short story &quot;Mimsy Were the Borogoves&quot;.
* Katie Roiphe has written a fictional (claimed to be based on fact) account of the relationship between Alice and Carroll, titled &quot;Still She Haunts Me&quot;.
* The 1985 film &quot;Dreamchild&quot; deals with her trip to America for the Columbia University presentation described above; through a series of flashbacks, it promotes the popular assumption that Dodgson was romantically attracted to Alice.
* The 2004 film &quot;Sincerely Yours, Lewis Carroll&quot;, Liddell makes an appearance with her sisters Lorina and Edith, being photographed by Dodgson in the summer of 1855. Unlike other works, Liddell is not the main focus on the film, which turns its attentions to 1855 in Charles Dodgson&#x27;s life. The piece was based on the 1855 diaries of Charles Dodgson.
* Frank Beddor wrote &quot;The Looking Glass Wars&quot;, which reimagines the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; story and includes real-life characters such as the Liddells and Prince Leopold.

<text>Henry George Liddell (; 6 February 1811– 18 January 1898) was dean (1855–1891) of Christ Church, Oxford, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University (1870–1874), headmaster (1846–1855) of Westminster School (where a house is now named after him), author of &quot;A History of Rome&quot; (1855), and co-author (with Robert Scott) of the monumental work &quot;A Greek–English Lexicon&quot;, known as &quot;Liddell and Scott&quot;, which is still widely used by students of Greek. Lewis Carroll wrote &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; for Henry Liddell&#x27;s daughter Alice.

==Life==
Liddell received his education at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a double first degree in 1833, then became a college tutor, and was ordained in 1838.

Liddell was Headmaster of Westminster School from 1846 to 1855. Meanwhile, his life work, the great lexicon (based on the German work of Franz Passow), which he and Robert Scott began as early as 1834, had made good progress, and the first edition of &quot;Liddell and Scott&#x27;s Lexicon&quot; appeared in 1843. It immediately became the standard Greek–English dictionary, with the 8th edition published in 1897.

As Headmaster of Westminster Liddell enjoyed a period of great success, followed by trouble due to the outbreak of fever and cholera in the school. In 1855 he accepted the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. In the same year he brought out his &quot;History of Ancient Rome&quot; and took a very active part in the first Oxford University Commission. His tall figure, fine presence and aristocratic mien were for many years associated with all that was characteristic of Oxford life. Coming just at the transition period when the &quot;old Christ Church,&quot; which Pusey strove so hard to preserve, was inevitably becoming broader and more liberal, it was chiefly due to Liddell that necessary changes were effected with the minimum of friction.

In 1859 Liddell welcomed the then Prince of Wales when he matriculated at Christ Church, being the first holder of that title who had matriculated since Henry V. While Liddell was Dean of Christ Church, he arranged for the building of a new choir school and classrooms for the staff and pupils of Christ Church Cathedral School on its present site. Before then the school was housed within Christ Church itself.

In conjunction with Sir Henry Acland, Liddell did much to encourage the study of art at Oxford, and his taste and judgment gained him the admiration and friendship of Ruskin. In 1891, owing to advancing years, he resigned the deanery. The last years of his life were spent at Ascot, where he died on 18 January 1898. Two roads in Ascot, Liddell Way and Carroll Crescent honour the relationship between Henry Liddell and Lewis Carroll.
Liddell was an Oxford &quot;character&quot; in later years. He figures in contemporary undergraduate doggerel:

The Victorian journalist, George W. E. Russell (1853–1919), conveys something of Liddell&#x27;s image:

==Works==
Henry George Liddell was the author of

* , and numerous editions of the same, including abridgments for student use, written with Robert Scott. 
* , excerpted from the Roman history.
* , excerpted from the Roman history and revised.

==Family==
His father was Henry Liddell, Rector of Easington (1787–1872), the younger son of Sir Henry Liddell, 5th Baronet (1749–1791) and the former Elizabeth Steele. His father&#x27;s elder brother, Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet (1775–1855), was raised to the Peerage as Baron Ravensworth in 1821.

His mother was the former Charlotte Lyon (1785–1871), a daughter of Thomas Lyon (1741–1796) (who was the youngest son of the 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne) and the former Mary Wren (died 1811).
On 2 July 1846, Henry married Lorina Reeve (3 March 1826 – 25 June 1910). They were parents of ten children:

* Edward Henry Liddell – also known as Harry (6 September 1847 – 14 June 1911).
* Lorina Charlotte &#x27;Ina&#x27; Liddell (11 May 1849 – 29 October 1930); married William Baillie Skene in 1874.

* Alice Pleasance Liddell (4 May 1852 – 16 November 1934), who was the inspiration for the children&#x27;s book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. She married Reginald Gervis Hargreaves, a former student from Christ Church and an English cricketer, had three sons with two being killed in World War I.
* Edith Mary Liddell (Spring, 1854 – 26 June 1876).
* Rhoda Caroline Anne Liddell (1859 – 19 May 1949); she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1920 for her orthopaedic work at Netley Red Cross Hospital.

* Sir Frederick Francis Liddell (7 June 1865 – 19 March 1950): First Parliamentary Counsel and Ecclesiastical Commissioner. His son, Maurice Arthur Liddell, married Alix Kerr OBE (May 1907 – 6 July 1981), British writer who contributed to the Guiding and Girl Scouting.
* Lionel Charles Liddell (22 May 1868 – 21 March 1942); he was British Consul to Lyons and Copenhagen.

<text>A happening is a performance, event, or situation art, usually as performance art. The term was first used by Allan Kaprow during the 1950s to describe a range of art-related events.
==History==

===Origins===

Allan Kaprow first coined the term &quot;happening&quot; in the spring of 1959 at an art picnic at George Segal&#x27;s farm to describe the art pieces being performed. The first appearance in print about one was in Kaprow&#x27;s famous &quot;Legacy of Jackson Pollock&quot; essay that was published in 1958 but primarily written in 1956. &quot;Happening&quot; also appeared in print in one issue of the Rutgers University undergraduate literary magazine, &quot;Anthologist&quot;. The form was imitated and the term was adopted by artists across the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

Happenings are difficult to describe, in part because each one is unique. One definition comes from Wardrip-Fruin and Montfort in &quot;The New Media Reader&quot;, &quot;The term &#x27;happening&#x27; has been used to describe many performances and events, organized by Allan Kaprow and others during the 1950s and 1960s, including a number of theatrical productions that were traditionally scripted and invited only limited audience interaction.&quot; Another definition is &quot;a purposefully composed form of theatre in which diverse alogical elements, including nonmatrixed performing, are organized in a compartmented structure&quot;. However, Canadian theatre critic and playwright Gary Botting, who himself had &quot;constructed&quot; several happenings, wrote in 1972: &quot;Happenings abandoned the matrix of story and plot for the equally complex matrix of incident and event.&quot;

Kaprow was a student of John Cage, who had experimented with &quot;musical happenings&quot; at Black Mountain College as early as 1952. Kaprow combined the theatrical and visual arts with discordant music. &quot;His happenings incorporated the use of huge constructions or sculptures similar to those suggested by Artaud,&quot; wrote Botting, who also compared them to the &quot;impermanent art&quot; of Dada. &quot;A happening explores negative space in the same way Cage explored silence. It is a form of symbolism: actions concerned with &#x27;now&#x27; or fantasies derived from life, or organized structures of events appealing to archetypal symbolic associations.&quot; A &quot;Happening&quot; of the same performance will have different outcomes because each performance depends on the action of the audience.

Happenings can be a form of participatory new media art, emphasizing an interaction between the performer and the audience. In his &quot;Water&quot;, Robert Whitman had the performers drench each other with colored water. &quot;One girl squirmed between wet inner tubes, ultimately struggling through a large silver vulva.&quot; Claes Oldenburg, best known for his innovative sculptures, used a vacant house, his own store, and the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Los Angeles for &quot;Injun&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Fair II&quot; and &quot;AUT OBO DYS&quot;. The idea was to break down the fourth wall between performer and spectator; with the involvement of the spectator as performer, objective criticism is transformed into subjective support. For some happenings, everyone present is included in the making of the art and even the form of the art depends on audience engagement, for they are a key factor in where the performers&#x27; spontaneity leads.

Later happenings had no set rules, only vague guidelines that the performers follow based on surrounding props. Unlike other forms of art, happenings that allow chance to enter are ever-changing. When chance determines the path the performance will follow, there is no room for failure. As Kaprow wrote in his essay, &quot;&#x27;Happenings&#x27; in the New York Scene&quot;, &quot;Visitors to a Happening are now and then not sure what has taken place, when it has ended, even when things have gone &#x27;wrong&quot;. For when something goes &#x27;wrong&#x27;, something far more &#x27;right,&#x27; more revelatory, has many times emerged&quot;.

Kaprow&#x27;s piece &quot;18 Happenings in 6 Parts&quot; (1959) is commonly cited as the first happening, although that distinction is sometimes given to a 1952 performance of &quot;Theater Piece No. 1&quot; at Black Mountain College by John Cage, one of Kaprow&#x27;s teachers in the mid-1950s. Cage stood reading from a ladder, Charles Olson read from another ladder, Robert Rauschenberg showed some of his paintings and played wax cylinders of Édith Piaf on an Edison horn recorder, David Tudor performed on a prepared piano and Merce Cunningham danced. All these things took place at the same time, among the audience rather than on a stage. Cage credited a collaborative close reading of Antonin Artaud&#x27;s &quot;The Theatre and Its Double&quot; with M.C. Richards and David Tudor as the impetus for the event.

Happenings flourished in New York City in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Key contributors to the form included Carolee Schneemann, Red Grooms, Robert Whitman, Jim Dine &quot;Car Crash&quot;, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Delford Brown, Lucas Samaras, and Robert Rauschenberg. Some of their work is documented in Michael Kirby&#x27;s book &quot;Happenings&quot; (1966). Kaprow claimed that &quot;some of us will become famous, and we will have proven once again that the only success occurred when there was a lack of it&quot;. In 1963 Wolf Vostell made the happening &quot;TV-Burying&quot; at the Yam Festival in coproduction with the Smolin Gallery and in 1964 the happening &quot;You&quot; in Great Neck, New York which is on Long Island.

During the summer of 1959, Red Grooms along with others (Yvonne Andersen, Bill Barrell, Sylvia Small and Dominic Falcone) staged the non-narrative &quot;play&quot; &quot;Walking Man&quot;, which began with construction sounds, such as sawing. Grooms recalls, &quot;The curtains were opened by me, playing a fireman wearing a simple costume of white pants and T-shirt with a poncholike cloak and a Smokey Stoverish fireman&#x27;s helmet. Bill, the &#x27;star&#x27; in a tall hat and black overcoat, walked back and forth across the stage with great wooden gestures. Yvonne sat on the floor by a suspended fire engine. She was a blind woman with tin-foil covered glasses and cup. Sylvia played a radio and pulled on hanging junk. For the finale, I hid behind a false door and shouted pop code words. Then the cast did a wild run around and it ended&quot;. Dubbing his 148 Delancey Street studio The Delancey Street Museum, Grooms staged three more happenings there, &quot;A Garden&quot;, &quot;The Burning Building&quot; and &quot;The Magic Trainride&quot; (originally titled &quot;Fireman&#x27;s Dream&quot;). No wonder Kaprow called Grooms &quot;a Charlie Chaplin forever dreaming about fire&quot;. On the opening night of &quot;The Burning Building&quot;, Bob Thompson solicited an audience member for a light, since none of the cast had one, and this gesture of spontaneous theater recurred in eight subsequent performances.
The Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama staged nude happenings during the late &#x27;60s in New York City.

===Difference from plays===
Happenings emphasize the organic connection between art and its environment. Kaprow supports that &quot;happenings invite us to cast aside for a moment these proper manners and partake wholly in the real nature of the art and life. It is a rough and sudden act, where one often feels &quot;dirty&quot;, and dirt, we might begin to realize, is also organic and fertile, and everything including the visitors can grow a little into such circumstances.&quot; 
Happenings have no plot or philosophy, but rather are materialized in an improvisatory fashion. There is no direction thus the outcome is unpredictable. &quot;It is generated in action by a headful of ideas...and it frequently has words but they may or may not make literal sense. If they do, their meaning is not representational of what the whole element conveys. Hence they carry a brief, detached quality. If they do not make sense, then they are acknowledgement of the sound of the word rather than the meaning conveyed by it.&quot;

Due to the convention&#x27;s nature, there is no such term as &quot;failure&quot; which can be applied. &quot;For when something goes &quot;wrong&quot;, something far more &quot;right&quot;, more revelatory may emerge. This sort of sudden near-miracle presently is made more likely by chance procedures.&quot; As a conclusion, a happening is fresh while it lasts and cannot be reproduced.

Regarding happenings, Red Grooms has remarked, &quot;I had the sense that I knew it was something. I knew it was something because I didn&#x27;t know what it was. I think that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re at your best point. When you&#x27;re really doing something, you&#x27;re doing it all out, but you don&#x27;t know what it is.&quot;

The lack of plot as well as the expected audience participation can be likened to Augusto Boal&#x27;s Theater of the Oppressed, which also claims that &quot;spectator is a bad word&quot;. Boal expected audience members to participate in the theater of the oppressed by becoming the actors. His goal was to allow the downtrodden to act out the forces oppressing them in order to mobilize the people into political action. Both Kaprow and Boal are reinventing theater to try to make plays more interactive and to abolish the traditional narrative form to make theater something more free-form and organic.

===Contribution toward digital media===

Allan Kaprow&#x27;s and other artists of the 1950s and 1960s that performed these happenings helped put &quot;new media technology developments into context&quot;. The happenings allowed other artists to create performances that would attract attention to the issue they wanted to portray.

===Around the world===
In 1959 the French artist Yves Klein first performed &quot;Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle&quot;. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for gold; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the Seine. The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.

In 1960, Jean-Jacques Lebel supervised and participated in the first European happening &quot;L&#x27;enterrement de la Chose&quot; in Venice. For his performance there – called &quot;Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process&quot; – Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped &#x27;cadaver&#x27; rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an &#x27;executioner&#x27; while a &#x27;service&#x27; was read consisting of extracts from the French décadent writer Joris-Karl Huysmans and le Marquis de Sade. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the &#x27;body&#x27;–which was a mechanical sculpture by Jean Tinguely –was ceremonially slid into the canal.

Poet and painter Adrian Henri claimed to have organized the first happenings in England in Liverpool in 1962, taking place during the Merseyside Arts Festival. The most important event in London was the Albert Hall &quot;International Poetry Incarnation&quot; on June 11, 1965, where an audience of 7,000 people witnessed and participated in performances by some of the leading &quot;avant-garde&quot; young British and American poets of the day (see British Poetry Revival and Poetry of the United States). One of the participants, Jeff Nuttall, went on to organize a number of further happenings, often working with his friend Bob Cobbing, sound poet and performance poet.

In Tokyo in 1964, Yoko Ono created a happening by performing her &quot;Cut Piece&quot; at the Sogetsu Art Center. She walked onto the stage draped in fabric, presented the audience with a pair of scissors, and instructed the audience to cut the fabric away gradually until the performer decided they should stop. This piece was presented again in 1966 at the &quot;Destruction in Art Symposium&quot; in London, this time allowing the cutting away of her street cloths.
In Belgium, the first happenings were organized around 1965–1968 in Antwerp, Brussels and Ostend by artists Hugo Heyrman and Panamarenko.

In the Netherlands, the first documented happening took place in 1961, with the Dutch artist and performer Wim T. Schippers emptying a bottle of soda water in the North Sea near Petten. Later on, he organized random walks in the Amsterdam city centre. Provo organized happenings around the a statue &quot;Het Lieverdje&quot; on the Spui, a square in the centre of Amsterdam, from 1966 till 1968. Police often raided these events. In the 1960s Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell, Nam June Paik, Charlotte Moorman, Dick Higgins, and HA Schult staged happenings in Germany.

In Canada, Gary Botting created or &quot;constructed&quot; happenings between 1969 (in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland) and 1972 (in Edmonton, Alberta), including &quot;The Aeolian Stringer&quot; in which a &quot;captive&quot; audience was entangled in string emanating from a vacuum cleaner as it made its rounds (similar to Kaprow&#x27;s &quot;A Spring Happening&quot;, where he used a power lawnmower and huge electric fan to similar effect); &quot;Zen Rock Festival&quot; in which the central icon was a huge rock with which the audience interacted in unpredictable ways; &quot;Black on Black&quot; held in the Edmonton Art Gallery; and &quot;Pipe Dream,&quot; set in a men&#x27;s washroom with an all-female &quot;cast&quot;. In Australia, the Yellow House Artist Collective in Sydney housed 24-hour happenings throughout the early 1970s.

Behind the Iron Curtain in Poland, artist and theater director Tadeusz Kantor staged the first happenings beginning in 1965. In the second half of 1970s painter and performer Krzysztof Jung ran the Repassage gallery, which promoted performance art in Poland. Also in the second half of the 1980s, a student-based happening movement Orange Alternative founded by Major Waldemar Fydrych became known for its much attended happenings (over 10 thousand participants at one time) aimed against the military regime led by General Jaruzelski and the fear blocking the Polish society ever since martial law had been imposed in December 1981.

Since 1993 the artist Jens Galschiøt has had political happenings all over the world. In November 1993 he held the happening my inner beast where twenty sculptures were erected within 55 hours without the knowledge of the authorities all over Europe. Pillar of Shame is a series of Galschiøt&#x27;s sculptures. The first happening was erected in Hong Kong on 4 June 1997, ahead of the handover from British to Chinese rule on 1 July 1997, as a protest against China&#x27;s crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. On 1 May 1999, a Pillar of Shame was set up on the Zócalo in Mexico City and it stood for two days in front of the Parliament to protest the oppression of the region&#x27;s indigenous people.

The non-profit, artist-run organization, iKatun, artist group, The Institute of Infinitely Small Things, has reflected the use of &quot;happenings&quot; influence while incorporating the medium of internet. Their aim is one which &quot;fosters public engagement in the politics of information&quot;. Their project entitled &quot;The International Database of Corporate Commands&quot; presents a scrutinizing look at the super-saturating advertisements slogans, and &quot;commands&quot; of companies. &quot;The Institute for Infinitely Small Things&quot; uses the commands to conduct research performances, performances in which we attempt to enact, as literally as possible, what the command tells us to do and where it tells us to do it. For example, a user may look at a long list of slogans on the website database section, and may submit, in text, his or her take on the most literal way to act out the slogan/command. The iKatun team will then act out the slogan in a research-performance related way. This means of performance art draws on the collaboration of the web world and tangible reality to conduct a new, modern happening.

Starting around 2010, a world-wide group called The Order of the Third Bird started creating flashmob style art appreciation happenings.

In 2018 the Prague-based performance and poetics collective was established by writers Tyko Say and Jeff Milton. The collective has since aimed to make poetry readings more similar to language happenings which involve a variety of interdisciplinary acts and performances occurring at the same time.

===Philosophy===
Kaprow explains that happenings are not a new style, but a moral act, a human stand of great urgency, whose professional status as art is less critical than their certainty as an ultimate existential commitment. He argues that once artists have been recognized and paid, they also surrender to the confinement, rather the tastes of the patrons (even if that may not be the intention on both ends). &quot;The whole situation is corrosive, neither patrons nor artists comprehend their role...and out of this hidden discomfort comes a stillborn art, tight or merely repetitive and at worst, chic.&quot; Though the we may easily blame those offering the temptation, Kaprow reminds us that it is not the publicist&#x27;s moral obligation to protect the artist&#x27;s freedom, and artists themselves hold the ultimate power to reject fame if they do not want its responsibilities.

==Festivals as happenings==
Art and music festivals play a large role in positive and successful happenings. Some of the festivals include Burning Man and the Oregon Country Fair near Veneta, Oregon. Along with the famous work of Allan Kaprow, Burning Man frowns on the idea of having spectators and stresses the importance of everyone being involved to create something amazing and unique. Both parties embody the &quot;audience&quot; and instead of creating something to show people, the audience becomes involved in helping create something incredible and spontaneous for the moment.Both of these events are happenings which are recreated and special each year; they are seen as being always new and organic. The events draw crowds of close to 50,000 people each year and reach more people than just the attendees with their messages and ideals.

<text>Wolf Vostell (14 October 1932 – 3 April 1998) was a German painter and sculptor, considered one of the early adopters of video art and installation art and pioneer of Happenings and Fluxus. Techniques such as blurring and Dé-coll/age are characteristic of his work, as is embedding objects in concrete and the use of television sets in his works. Wolf Vostell was married to the Spanish writer Mercedes Vostell and has two sons, David Vostell and Rafael Vostell.

== Biography ==
Wolf Vostell was born in Leverkusen, Germany, and put his artistic ideas into practice from 1950 onwards. In 1953, he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and studied at the Academy of Applied Art in Wuppertal. Vostell created his first Dé-coll/age in 1954. In 1955–1956, he studied at the École Nationale Superieur des Beaux Arts in Paris and in 1957 he attended the Düsseldorf Academy of Arts. Vostell&#x27;s philosophy was built around the idea that destruction is all around us and it runs through all of the twentieth century. He used the term &quot;Dé-coll/age&quot;, (in connection with a plane crash) in 1954 to refer to the process of tearing down posters, and for the use of mobile fragments of reality. For Vostell, Dé-coll/age is a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media.

His first Happening, &quot;The Theater is in the Street&quot;, took place in Paris in 1958, and incorporated auto parts and a TV. Impressed by the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen, which he encountered in the electronic studios of the German radio station WDR, he created his electronic &quot;TV Dé-coll/age&quot; in 1959. This marked the beginning of his dedication to the Fluxus Movement, which he co-founded in 1962. During this period, Vostell was behind many Happenings in New York, Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm among others. In 1962 he participated in the FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik event in Wiesbaden together with Nam June Paik, George Maciunas and other artists. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of Video art and Installation with his work &quot;6-TV-Dé-coll/age&quot; shown at the Smolin Gallery in New York, now in the collections of the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. The Smolin Gallery sponsored two innovative Wolf Vostell events on TV; the first, &quot;Wolf Vostell and Television Decollage&quot;, featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to create poster art on the walls. In 1967 his Happening &quot;Miss Vietnam&quot; dealt with the subject of the Vietnam war. In 1968, he founded Labor e.V., a group that was to investigate acoustic and visual events, together with Mauricio Kagel, and others. In 1978 he met Salvador Dalí, with whom he would later create a joint project with a sculpture from each other in their museums.

Vostell was the first artist to integrate a television set into a work of art. This installation was created in 1958 under the title &quot;The black room&quot; and is now part of the collection of the art museum Berlinische Galerie in Berlin. Early works with television sets are &quot;Transmigracion&quot; I-III from 1958 and &quot;Elektronischer Dé-coll/age Happening Raum&quot;(&quot;Electronic Dé-coll/age Happening Room&quot;) an Installation from 1968. In 1974, his first major retrospective took place in the ARC 2 at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, an expanded version of which was shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie, in 1974.

Wolf Vostell&#x27;s automobile-concrete-sculptures made from cars and concrete are to be found in Cologne &quot;Ruhender Verkehr&quot; (&quot;Stationary traffic&quot;) from 1969, &quot;Concrete Traffic&quot; from 1970 in Chicago, &quot;VOAEX&quot; (&quot;Viaje de (H)ormigón por la Alta Extremadura&quot;) from 1976 in the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de Cáceres, Spain and 
&quot;Zwei Beton-Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja&quot; (&quot;Two Concrete Cadillacs in form of the Naked Maja&quot;) from 1987 in Berlin.

Vostell also gained recognition for his drawings and objects, such as images of American B-52 bombers, published under the rubric &quot;capitalist realism&quot; and as a result of his inclusion of television sets with his paintings. Nam June Paik and Vostell were both participants in the Fluxus movement and the work of both artists involved a critique of the fetishization of television and the culture of consumption. The catalogue raisonné of his screen prints and posters has been published in the &quot;Nouvelles de l&#x27;estampe&quot; by Françoise Woimant and Anne Moeglin-Delcroix in 1982.

In 1992, the town of Cologne honoured Vostell with a major retrospective of his work. His pieces were distributed over 6 exhibition venues: Stadtmuseum Köln, Kunsthalle Köln, Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, Kunsthalle Mannheim, Schloss Morsbroich Leverkusen and Städtisches Museum Mülheim / Ruhr. Under the artistic direction of David Vostell, the documentary &quot;Vostell 60 - Rückblick 92&quot; (&quot;Vostell 60 - Review 92&quot;) was created.

Vostell&#x27;s grave is at the Cementerio Civil de la Almudena in Madrid.

== Artistic work ==
From 1950 on, Vostell implemented his first artistic ideas, in 1953 he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and attended the Werkkunstschule at the Bergische Universität with Ernst Oberhoff in Wuppertal. On 6 September 1954 in Paris, he found the word décollage (i.e. to lift off, loosen, loosen the glued, separate) on the title page of Le Figaro, which was used in connection with the crash of a Lockheed Super Constellation into the Shannon. Vostell changed the spelling to Dé-coll/age and applied the term to his poster tear-offs and happenings. For Wolf Vostell, Dé-coll/age became a design principle and a comprehensive concept of art.

In 1955/1956 he attended the Parisian École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts and in 1957 the Düsseldorf Art Academy. Vostell&#x27;s Happening Das Theater ist auf der Straße from 1958 in Paris was the first happening in Europe. His happening Cityrama of 1961 in Cologne was the first happening in Germany. Vostell produced objects with televisions and car parts. Influenced by the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen in the electronic studio of the WDR, electronic TV-Dé-coll/agen were produced in 1959. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the Fluxus movement, which he co-founded in 1962.

In 1959 Vostell founded the Vostell-archive. Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, personal correspondence with companions like Nam June Paik, Joseph Beuys, Dick Higgins, as well as other objects, which documented the work of the artists of his generation. Since the 1990s, Vostell&#x27;s private library has been part of the archive. His work is documented photographically and is also part of the archive, which has been housed in the &quot;Museo Vostell Malpartida&quot; since 2006.

Vostell initiated further happenings, among others 9-Nein-dé-coll/agen in Wuppertal in 1963, the Happening You in New York in 1964 and others in Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of video art with the installation &quot;6 TV Dé-coll/age&quot; in the collection of the Museo Reina Sofía Madrid and with the video Sun in your head. In 1965 he took part in the 24-hour happening at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal. In 1967 he dealt with the Vietnam War in the happening Miss Vietnam. In 1968, in collaboration with the composer Mauricio Kagel and others, he founded Labor e.V., which was to research acoustic and visual events.

Vostell is regarded as the first artist who integrated a television set into a work of art. This environment from 1958, consisting of three assemblages, entitled Das schwarze Zimmer (German View, Auschwitz Spotlight 568, Treblinka) is part of the collection of the Berlinische Galerie. Early works with televisions are Transmigracion I to III, from 1958, and Elektronischer dé-coll/age Happening Raum, an installation from 1968.

Since the 1950s Wolf Vostell has thematized the Holocaust in numerous works. Wolf Vostell did not want to express with his outward appearance that he was Jewish by his appearance he rather carried his values to the outside world and thus directed himself unambiguously against the danger of suppressing or even forgetting the extermination of European Jews by the German National Socialists. With his temple curls, fur hat and caftan, he was a perfect match for the image of the enemy that the propaganda of the Hitler regime had painted as an anti-Semitic stereotype, following the example of the Eastern European Jews. He exaggerated this image by using other attributes, such as ostentatious rings on his fingers and an equally thick cigar, which in slanderous caricatures from the Nazi era had been symbolically given to the &quot;money-greedy Jewish usurer&quot;.

=== First works ===
In 1953, he initially produced traditionally produced works such as &quot;Korea&quot; and Korea Massacre (both oil on paper), War Crucifixion II (oil on canvas) as well as the watercolors The Couple, Family, Airplane and War Crucifixion. In 1955, he drew a cycle of ink drawings on Peter Schlemihl&#x27;s miraculous story.

=== 1960s ===
In 1962 Vostell participated in the Fluxus manifestation Fluxus: International Festival of Contemporary Music in Wiesbaden and in 1963 in the Fluxus festival Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in Düsseldorf. In 1962 he founded the journal Dé-coll/age - Bulletin of Current Ideas. In 1963 he showed the installation Das schwarze Zimmer (The Black Room), which is installed in a dark room with black painted walls, in the Galerie Parnass. In 1964 Vostell initiated the Happening In Ulm, around Ulm and around Ulm - in the same year he had his first exhibition participation in the 13th exhibition of the Deutscher Künstlerbund in Berlin. In 1965 the Happenings Berlin 100 Ereignisse and 1967 Miss Vietnam followed. He often took up political and social themes.

Between 1965 and 1969, exhibitions, happenings, multiples and publications were created in collaboration with René Block. In 1968 he created the silkscreen B-52 - instead of bombs. In 1969 - in cooperation with the gallery art intermedia of Helmut Rywelski in Cologne - Vostell created his first car-concrete sculpture &quot;Ruhender Verkehr&quot; (resting traffic). 

In January 1970, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Chicago sponsored a happening in which Vostell encased a 1957 Cadillac in concrete at a parking lot near the museum, creating the work &quot;Concrete Traffic&quot; (1970). The work was moved via highway to the University of Chicago campus in 1970, where it remained for nearly four decades. The work was restored and moved to the University of Chicago campus in 2016.

=== Berlin and Malpartida de Cáceres ===
In 1970 Vostell moved to Berlin. In 1970 he created Heuschrecken, an installation with 20 monitors and a video camera. The installations TV-Schuhe and TEK were created in the same year. In 1973 he created the cycle Mania. 40 works in which Vostell drew on photographs from magazines and glued objects onto the photographs. In 1973 he created the installations Auto Fieber und Energie. 1976 Vostell founded the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de Cáceres. In 1974 he realized the happening Strawberries in Berlin.

From 1975 onwards, he worked on Spanish themes such as the paintings in the Extremadura cycle, the 1976 cycle El muerto que tiene sed (The Thirsty Dead Man) or 1985 El entierro de la Sardina (The Burial of the Sardine). In the 1980s he created the installation The Winds, the painting The Battle of Anghiari from 1982, a reminiscence of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting of the same name Battle of Anghiari, the cycle Milonga from 1985, and the Tauromaqie with BMW part from 1988.

In the 1980s, he proposed a joint project with Salvador Dalí whom he met in 1978. This was realized as one of Dalí&#x27;s last projects in 1988, shortly before his death. Vostell carried out a work of Dalí, which Dalí had already conceived in the 1920s. El fin de Parzival (the end of the Parzival) consists of 20 motorcycles of the Guardia Civil from the time of the Franco regime, five of which are fastened on top of each other and backed by the music of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera Parzival. Initially, Dalí intended to use bicycles. This addition was made by Vostell. In return, Wolf Vostell installed 1988 the sculpture TV-Obelisk (1979) in the Teatre-Museu in Figueres with 14 TV sets and Dalí completed the sculpture with a woman&#x27;s head on the top, which he created. Inside the woman&#x27;s head is a video camera that records images of the sky, which are transmitted to the TV sets.

=== 1990s ===
In Berlin, he created large-format paintings such as the Triptych Berlin from 1990, the cycle Weinende from 1992 and Weinende Hommage an Anne Frank. Bronze sculptures like Berlinerin from 1994 in a small edition. Graphic works, sculptures and assemblages such as Arc de Triomphe N°1 from 1993, Ritz from 1998 and multiples such as Berliner Brot from 1995.

== Influence on art ==

=== Dé-coll/age and blurring ===
During a stay in Paris in September 1954, Vostell read the word Décollage in a headline of Le Figaro (German translation: &quot;Untie, loose the glued, separate&quot;). Vostell changed the spelling for himself. From 1954 on he named his poster tear-offs Dé-coll/age. Later he transferred the term Dé-coll/age to his happenings. For Wolf Vostell the Dé-coll/age became a design principle and a comprehensive concept of art. Ceres from 1960, Coca-Cola, your candidate, Great Session with Da (all pictures from 1961), Wochenspiegel Beatles and Livio from 1966 are examples of Wolf Vostell&#x27;s Dé-coll/agen.

In the 1960s Vostell worked with the technique of blurring. With a mixture of turpentine and carbon tetrachloride, photographs in magazines can be blurred. The cycle Kleenex from 1962, Kennedy before Corham from 1964, Goethe Today from 1967 and Homage to Henry Ford and Jaqueline Kennedy from 1967 are examples of Wolf Vostell&#x27;s blurred images. He combined dé-coll/age with blurring like in Jayne Mansfield from 1968 and Marilyn Monroe from 1962 or Hours of fun from 1968.

=== Politics ===
Vostell dealt with world political events in his artistic work from the 1950s on. As early as 1958 he thematized the Second World War and the Holocaust in the installation Das schwarze Zimmer (The Black Room). The Korean War and the Vietnam War became themes of his works, as they did with his 1968 blurred Miss America. The assassination of John F. Kennedy and other international political events were the subject of his paintings and assemblages.

Vostell also thematized domestic political topics of the Federal Republic. The student revolts, the economic miracle and the criticism of capitalism are documented in his works. The Cold War and the Bosnian War are present in his works. Wolf Vostell documented and processed the fall of the Berlin Wall in more than 50 works. From the 6 meter wide triptych 9 November 1989 to smaller works, Vostell created a further cycle of works after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Over the decades a political work was created in Vostell&#x27;s work.

=== Television ===
Beginning in 1958 Vostell integrated television sets into his works. Pictures, assemblages, installations and sculptures by Wolf Vostell are often designed with TV sets. Most of the time the sets are set to normal program. Thus Wolf Vostell incorporates topicality and current events into his works.

=== Tauromaquia ===
From 1976 Vostell travelled regularly between Berlin and Malpartida de Cáceres. During this time he created a series of paintings and drawings in his Spanish studio, which show the theme Tauromaquia. Large-format canvases show bulls, mostly bleeding and torn to shreds. He made assemblages in which he combined painted bull heads with light bulbs, car parts or other objects.

=== Concrete, lead, and gold ===
From the early 1960s on Vostell worked with concrete, which became a kind of distinctive feature of his works. He created sculptures, like his car-concrete sculptures. He also processed the concrete liquid as a color for his paintings and drawings. He also painted with liquid concrete, acrylic paint and charcoal. In his paintings and drawings you can see many times drawn concrete blocks. Human bodies can often be recognized as angular concrete forms. In the 1980s and 1990s he worked with liquid lead. He poured liquid lead over his canvases, combining acrylic paint, liquid lead and liquid concrete. Wolf Vostell also worked with gold leaf, which he applied directly to the canvas.

In his concrete car sculptures, such as &quot;Ruhender Verkehr&quot;/&quot;Stationary Traffic&quot; (1969) and &quot;Concrete Traffic&quot; (1970), Vostell foregrounded these art objects&#x27; relationship to the everyday. For Vostell, it was important that these concrete car sculptures be placed an urban setting among other, operational cars. Vostell spoke about de-familiarization provoked by unusual modes of encountering everyday objects: &quot;I show that there are different realities...I take the TV, the same model that the public has at home, and I defamiliarize it, and this is conceivably shocking... The real disturbance is that their well-known objects, their spoon, their lipstick, their status symbols, their cars are used, and therein lies the content... It is (art)work with familiar objects that causes such disturbances in thinking, in consciousness.&quot;

== Wolf Vostell Archive ==
In the 1960s, Vostell founded the Vostell Archive. With great fervour and strict consistency, Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, private correspondence with colleagues such as Nam June Paik, Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins and many others, as well as press cuttings, invitations to exhibitions and events or books and catalogues which document wolf Vostell&#x27;s work and that of his contemporaries. His private library with more than 6000 books has formed part of the Archive. Wolf Vostell&#x27;s extensive oeuvre is documented in photographic form and makes up part of the archive. About 50000 documents from four decades make the Vostell Archive a treasure of art history. Since 2005 the archive has been housed in the Museo Vostell Malpartida and is available to art historians, journalists and scholars.

== Reception ==
In 1989 the Art&#x27;otel Berlin Kudamm opened, which Wolf Vostell has as its theme and thus became a permanent exhibition.

In 1990, Vostell&#x27;s triptych 9 November 1989 and design drawings for it were exhibited for the first time in the eastern part of Berlin in the gallery at Weidendamm in Friedrichstraße 103.

In 1992 the city of Cologne honoured Vostell with a retrospective of his work. His works were exhibited at six venues: the Cologne City Museum, the Kunsthalle Köln, the Rheinische Landesmuseum Bonn, the Kunsthalle Mannheim, the Schloss Morsbroich in Leverkusen and the Kunstmuseum Mülheim an der Ruhr. Under the artistic direction of David Vostell, the documentary film Vostell 60 - Retrospective 92 was produced about this retrospective.

Since 1989, the 1969 car-concrete sculpture Resting Traffic, for which Vostell cast an Opel Kapitän in concrete, has stood on the central reservation of the Hohenzollernring in Cologne. Other car-concrete sculptures are Concrete Traffic from 1970 in Chicago, in the Museo Vostell Malpartida V.O.A.E.X. from 1976 and Two Concrete Cadillacs in the shape of the naked Maja in Berlin from 1987.

<doc id="144052" wikidata="Q2293759" url="?curid=144052" title="Torsion subgroup">
<text>In the theory of abelian groups, the torsion subgroup &quot;AT&quot; of an abelian group &quot;A&quot; is the subgroup of &quot;A&quot; consisting of all elements that have finite order (the torsion elements of &quot;A&quot;). An abelian group &quot;A&quot; is called a torsion group (or periodic group) if every element of &quot;A&quot; has finite order and is called torsion-free if every element of &quot;A&quot; except the identity is of infinite order.

The proof that &quot;AT&quot; is closed under the group operation relies on the commutativity of the operation (see examples section).

If &quot;A&quot; is abelian, then the torsion subgroup &quot;T&quot; is a fully characteristic subgroup of &quot;A&quot; and the factor group &quot;A&quot;/&quot;T&quot; is torsion-free. There is a covariant functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of torsion groups that sends every group to its torsion subgroup and every homomorphism to its restriction to the torsion subgroup. There is another covariant functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of torsion-free groups that sends every group to its quotient by its torsion subgroup, and sends every homomorphism to the obvious induced homomorphism (which is easily seen to be well-defined).

If &quot;A&quot; is finitely generated and abelian, then it can be written as the direct sum of its torsion subgroup &quot;T&quot; and a torsion-free subgroup (but this is not true for all infinitely generated abelian groups). In any decomposition of &quot;A&quot; as a direct sum of a torsion subgroup &quot;S&quot; and a torsion-free subgroup, &quot;S&quot; must equal &quot;T&quot; (but the torsion-free subgroup is not uniquely determined). This is a key step in the classification of finitely generated abelian groups.

==&quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroups==
For any abelian group formula_1 and any prime number &quot;p&quot; the set &quot;ATp&quot; of elements of &quot;A&quot; that have order a power of &quot;p&quot; is a subgroup called the &quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroup or, more loosely, the &quot;p&quot;-torsion subgroup:

:formula_2

The torsion subgroup &quot;AT&quot; is isomorphic to the direct sum of its &quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroups over all prime numbers &quot;p&quot;:

:formula_3

When &quot;A&quot; is a finite abelian group, &quot;ATp&quot; coincides with the unique Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of &quot;A&quot;.

Each &quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroup of &quot;A&quot; is a fully characteristic subgroup. More strongly, any homomorphism between abelian groups sends each &quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroup into the corresponding &quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroup.

For each prime number &quot;p&quot;, this provides a functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of &quot;p&quot;-power torsion groups that sends every group to its &quot;p&quot;-power torsion subgroup, and restricts every homomorphism to the &quot;p&quot;-torsion subgroups. The product over the set of all prime numbers of the restriction of these functors to the category of torsion groups, is a faithful functor from the category of torsion groups to the product over all prime numbers of the categories of &quot;p&quot;-torsion groups. In a sense, this means that studying &quot;p&quot;-torsion groups in isolation tells us everything about torsion groups in general.

==Examples and further results==
*The torsion subset of a non-abelian group is not, in general, a subgroup. For example, in the infinite dihedral group, which has presentation:

: formula_4

:the element &quot;xy&quot; is a product of two torsion elements, but has infinite order.
* The torsion elements in a nilpotent group form a normal subgroup.
*Every finite abelian group is a torsion group. Not every torsion group is finite however: consider the direct sum of a countable number of copies of the cyclic group &quot;C&quot;2; this is a torsion group since every element has order 2. Nor need there be an upper bound on the orders of elements in a torsion group if it isn&#x27;t finitely generated, as the example of the factor group Q/Z shows.
*Every free abelian group is torsion-free, but the converse is not true, as is shown by the additive group of the rational numbers Q.
*Even if &quot;A&quot; is not finitely generated, the &quot;size&quot; of its torsion-free part is uniquely determined, as is explained in more detail in the article on rank of an abelian group.
*An abelian group &quot;A&quot; is torsion-free if and only if it is flat as a Z-module, which means that whenever &quot;C&quot; is a subgroup of some abelian group &quot;B&quot;, then the natural map from the tensor product &quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;A&quot; is injective.
*Tensoring an abelian group &quot;A&quot; with Q (or any divisible group) kills torsion. That is, if &quot;T&quot; is a torsion group then &quot;T&quot; ⊗ Q = 0. For a general abelian group &quot;A&quot; with torsion subgroup &quot;T&quot; one has &quot;A&quot; ⊗ Q ≅ &quot;A&quot;/&quot;T&quot; ⊗ Q.
*Taking the torsion subgroup makes torsion abelian groups into a coreflective subcategory of abelian groups, while taking the quotient by the torsion subgroup makes torsion-free abelian groups into a reflective subcategory.

<text>Alesso or Alessio Baldovinetti (14 October 1427 – 29 August 1499) was an Italian early Renaissance painter and draftsman.

==Biography==

Baldovinetti was born in Florence to a rich noble family of merchants. In 1448 he was registered as a member of the Guild of St. Luke: &quot;Alesso di Baldovinetti, dipintore.&quot;

He was a follower of the group of scientific realists and naturalists in art which included Andrea del Castagno, Paolo Uccello and Domenico Veneziano. Tradition says that he assisted in the decorations of the church of S. Egidio, however no records confirm this. These decoration were carried out during the years 1441–1451 by Domenico Veneziano and in conjunction with Andrea del Castagno. That he was commissioned to complete the series at a later date (1460) is certain.

In 1460 Alesso was employed to paint the great fresco of the&quot; Annunciation&quot; in the cloister of the Annunziata basilica. The remains as we see them give evidence of the artist&#x27;s power both of imitating natural detail with minute fidelity and of spacing his figures in a landscape with a large sense of air and distance; and they amply verify two separate statements of Vasari concerning him: that &quot;he delighted in drawing landscapes from nature exactly as they are, whence we see in his paintings rivers; bridges, rocks, plants, fruits, roads, fields, cities, exercise grounds, and an infinity of other such things,&quot; and that he was an inveterate experimentalist in technical matters.
His favourite method in wall-painting was to lay in his compositions in fresco and finish them &quot;a secco&quot; with a mixture of yolk of egg and liquid varnish. This, says Vasari, was with the view of protecting the painting from damp; but in course of time the parts executed with this vehicle scaled away, so that the great secret he hoped to have discovered turned out a failure. In 1463 he furnished a cartoon of the &quot;Nativity&quot;, which was executed in tarsia by Giuliano de Maiano in the sacristy of the cathedral and still exists. In c. 1465 he painted &quot;Portrait of a Lady in Yellow&quot;. From 1466 date the groups of four &quot;Evangelists and four Fathers of the Church&quot; in fresco, together with the &quot;Annunciation&quot; on an oblong panel, which still decorate the Portuguese chapel in the basilica of San Miniato, and are given in error by Vasari to Piero del Pollaiuolo. 

In 1471 Alesso undertook important works for the church of Santa Trinita on the commission of Bongianni Gianfigliazzi: first, to paint an altar-piece of the Holy Trinity with saints, a work that he finished in 1472; next, a series of frescoes from the Old Testament which was to be completed according to contract within five years, but actually remained on hand for fully twenty-six. In 1497 the finished series, which contained many portraits of leading Florentine citizens, was valued at a thousand gold florins by a committee consisting of Cosimo Rosselli, Benozzo Gozzoli, Perugino and Filippino Lippi; only some defaced fragments of it now remain. Meanwhile, Alesso had been much occupied with other technical pursuits and researches apart from painting. He was regarded by his contemporaries as the one craftsman who had rediscovered and fully understood the long disused art of mosaic, and was employed accordingly between 1481 and 1483 to repair the mosaics over the door of the church of S. Miniato, as well as several of those both within and without the baptistery of the cathedral. He died in the hospital San Paolo, August 29, 1499, and was buried in San Lorenzo.

One of his pupils was Domenico Ghirlandaio.

<text>A fluorescent lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp that uses fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current in the gas excites mercury vapor, to produce ultraviolet and make a phosphor coating in the lamp glow. Fluorescent lamps convert electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps, but are less efficient than most LED lamps. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lamps is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output (e.g. the luminous efficacy of an incandescent lamp may only be 16 lm/w).

Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because, among other things, they require a ballast to regulate current through the lamp, but the initial cost is offset by a much lower running cost. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) made in the same sizes as incandescent lamp bulbs are used as an energy-saving alternative to incandescent lamps in homes.

In the United States, fluorescent lamps are classified as universal waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.

==History==
===Physical discoveries===
====Fluorescence====
The fluorescence of certain rocks and other substances had been observed for hundreds of years before its nature was understood. One of the first to explain it was Irish scientist Sir George Stokes from the University of Cambridge in 1852, who named the phenomenon &quot;fluorescence&quot; after fluorite, a mineral many of whose samples glow strongly because of impurities.

====Discharge tubes====
By mid-19th century, experimenters had observed a radiant glow emanating from partially evacuated glass vessels through which an electric current passed. The explanation relied on the nature of electricity and light phenomena as developed by the British scientists Michael Faraday in the 1840s and James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.

Little more was done with this phenomenon until 1856 when German glassblower Heinrich Geissler created a mercury vacuum pump that evacuated a glass tube to an extent not previously possible. Geissler invented the first gas-discharge lamp, the Geissler tube, consisting of a partially evacuated glass tube with a metal electrode at either end. When a high voltage was applied between the electrodes, the inside of the tube illuminated with a glow discharge. By putting different chemicals inside, the tubes could be made to produce a variety of colors, and elaborate Geissler tubes were sold for entertainment. More important was its contribution to scientific research. One of the first scientists to experiment with a Geissler tube was Julius Plücker, who systematically described in 1858 the luminescent effects that occurred in a Geissler tube. He also made the important observation that the glow in the tube shifted position when in proximity to an electromagnetic field. Alexandre Edmond Becquerel observed in 1859 that certain substances gave off light when they were placed in a Geissler tube. He went on to apply thin coatings of luminescent materials to the surfaces of these tubes. Fluorescence occurred, but the tubes were inefficient and had a short operating life.

Inquiries that began with the Geissler tube continued as better vacuums were produced. The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by William Crookes. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury vacuum pump created by Hermann Sprengel. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Röntgen. The Crookes tube, as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too great and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated luminescence.

===Early discharge lamps===
Thomas Edison briefly pursued fluorescent lighting for its commercial potential. He invented a fluorescent lamp in 1896 that used a coating of calcium tungstate as the fluorescing substance, excited by X-rays. Although it received a patent in 1907, it was not put into production. As with a few other attempts to use Geissler tubes for illumination, it had a short operating life, and given the success of the incandescent light, Edison had little reason to pursue an alternative means of electrical illumination. Nikola Tesla made similar experiments in the 1890s, devising high-frequency powered fluorescent bulbs that gave a bright greenish light, but as with Edison&#x27;s devices, no commercial success was achieved.

One of Edison&#x27;s former employees created a gas-discharge lamp that achieved a measure of commercial success. In 1895 Daniel McFarlan Moore demonstrated lamps in length that used carbon dioxide or nitrogen to emit white or pink light, respectively. They were considerably more complicated than an incandescent bulb, requiring both a high-voltage power supply and a pressure-regulating system for the fill gas.
Moore invented an electromagnetically controlled valve that maintained a constant gas pressure within the tube, to extend the working life. Although Moore&#x27;s lamp was complicated, expensive, and required very high voltages, it was considerably more efficient than incandescent lamps, and it produced a closer approximation to natural daylight than contemporary incandescent lamps. From 1904 onwards Moore&#x27;s lighting system was installed in a number of stores and offices. Its success contributed to General Electric&#x27;s motivation to improve the incandescent lamp, especially its filament. GE&#x27;s efforts came to fruition with the invention of a tungsten-based filament. The extended lifespan and improved efficacy of incandescent bulbs negated one of the key advantages of Moore&#x27;s lamp, but GE purchased the relevant patents in 1912. These patents and the inventive efforts that supported them were of considerable value when the firm took up fluorescent lighting more than two decades later.

At about the same time that Moore was developing his lighting system, Peter Cooper Hewitt invented the mercury-vapor lamp, patented in 1901 (). Hewitt&#x27;s lamp glowed when an electric current was passed through mercury vapor at a low pressure. Unlike Moore&#x27;s lamps, Hewitt&#x27;s were manufactured in standardized sizes and operated at low voltages. The mercury-vapor lamp was superior to the incandescent lamps of the time in terms of energy efficiency, but the blue-green light it produced limited its applications. It was, however, used for photography and some industrial processes.

Mercury vapor lamps continued to be developed at a slow pace, especially in Europe. By the early 1930s they received limited use for large-scale illumination. Some of them employed fluorescent coatings, but these were used primarily for color correction and not for enhanced light output. Mercury vapor lamps also anticipated the fluorescent lamp in their incorporation of a ballast to maintain a constant current.

Cooper-Hewitt had not been the first to use mercury vapor for illumination, as earlier efforts had been mounted by Way, Rapieff, Arons, and Bastian and Salisbury. Of particular importance was the mercury-vapor lamp invented by Küch and Retschinsky in Germany. The lamp used a smaller bore bulb and higher current operating at higher pressures. As a consequence of the current, the bulb operated at a higher temperature which necessitated the use of a quartz bulb. Although its light output relative to electrical consumption was better than that of other sources of light, the light it produced was similar to that of the Cooper-Hewitt lamp in that it lacked the red portion of the spectrum, making it unsuitable for ordinary lighting. Due to difficulties in sealing the electrodes to the quartz, the lamp had a short life.

===Neon lamps===
The next step in gas-based lighting took advantage of the luminescent qualities of neon, an inert gas that had been discovered in 1898 by isolation from the atmosphere. Neon glowed a brilliant red when used in Geissler tubes. By 1910, Georges Claude, a Frenchman who had developed a technology and a successful business for air liquefaction, was obtaining enough neon as a byproduct to support a neon lighting industry. While neon lighting was used around 1930 in France for general illumination, it was no more energy-efficient than conventional incandescent lighting. Neon tube lighting, which also includes the use of argon and mercury vapor as alternative gases, came to be used primarily for eye-catching signs and advertisements. Neon lighting was relevant to the development of fluorescent lighting, however, as Claude&#x27;s improved electrode (patented in 1915) overcame &quot;sputtering&quot;, a major source of electrode degradation. Sputtering occurred when ionized particles struck an electrode and tore off bits of metal. Although Claude&#x27;s invention required electrodes with a lot of surface area, it showed that a major impediment to gas-based lighting could be overcome.

The development of the neon light also was significant for the last key element of the fluorescent lamp, its fluorescent coating. In 1926 Jacques Risler received a French patent for the application of fluorescent coatings to neon light tubes. The main use of these lamps, which can be considered the first commercially successful fluorescents, was for advertising, not general illumination. This, however, was not the first use of fluorescent coatings; Becquerel had earlier used the idea and Edison used calcium tungstate for his unsuccessful lamp. Other efforts had been mounted, but all were plagued by low efficiency and various technical problems. Of particular importance was the invention in 1927 of a low-voltage “metal vapor lamp” by Friedrich Meyer, Hans-Joachim Spanner, and Edmund Germer, who were employees of a German firm in Berlin. A German patent was granted but the lamp never went into commercial production.

===Commercialization of fluorescent lamps===
All the major features of fluorescent lighting were in place at the end of the 1920s. Decades of invention and development had provided the key components of fluorescent lamps: economically manufactured glass tubing, inert gases for filling the tubes, electrical ballasts, long-lasting electrodes, mercury vapor as a source of luminescence, effective means of producing a reliable electrical discharge, and fluorescent coatings that could be energized by ultraviolet light. At this point, intensive development was more important than basic research.

In 1934, Arthur Compton, a renowned physicist and GE consultant, reported to the GE lamp department on successful experiments with fluorescent lighting at General Electric Co., Ltd. in Great Britain (unrelated to General Electric in the United States). Stimulated by this report, and with all of the key elements available, a team led by George E. Inman built a prototype fluorescent lamp in 1934 at General Electric&#x27;s Nela Park (Ohio) engineering laboratory. This was not a trivial exercise; as noted by Arthur A. Bright, &quot;A great deal of experimentation had to be done on lamp sizes and shapes, cathode construction, gas pressures of both argon and mercury vapor, colors of fluorescent powders, methods of attaching them to the inside of the tube, and other details of the lamp and its auxiliaries before the new device was ready for the public.&quot;

In addition to having engineers and technicians along with facilities for R&amp;D work on fluorescent lamps, General Electric controlled what it regarded as the key patents covering fluorescent lighting, including the patents originally issued to Hewitt, Moore, and Küch. More important than these was a patent covering an electrode that did not disintegrate at the gas pressures that ultimately were employed in fluorescent lamps. Albert W. Hull of GE&#x27;s Schenectady Research Laboratory filed for a patent on this invention in 1927, which was issued in 1931. General Electric used its control of the patents to prevent competition with its incandescent lights and probably delayed the introduction of fluorescent lighting by 20 years. Eventually, war production required 24-hour factories with economical lighting, and fluorescent lights became available.

While the Hull patent gave GE a basis for claiming legal rights over the fluorescent lamp, a few months after the lamp went into production the firm learned of a U.S. patent application that had been filed in 1927 for the aforementioned &quot;metal vapor lamp&quot; invented in Germany by Meyer, Spanner, and Germer. The patent application indicated that the lamp had been created as a superior means of producing ultraviolet light, but the application also contained a few statements referring to fluorescent illumination. Efforts to obtain a U.S. patent had met with numerous delays, but were it to be granted, the patent might have caused serious difficulties for GE. At first, GE sought to block the issuance of a patent by claiming that priority should go to one of their employees, Leroy J. Buttolph, who according to their claim had invented a fluorescent lamp in 1919 and whose patent application was still pending. GE also had filed a patent application in 1936 in Inman&#x27;s name to cover the “improvements” wrought by his group. In 1939 GE decided that the claim of Meyer, Spanner, and Germer had some merit, and that in any event a long interference procedure was not in their best interest. They therefore dropped the Buttolph claim and paid $180,000 to acquire the Meyer, et al. application, which at that point was owned by a firm known as Electrons, Inc. The patent was duly awarded in December 1939. This patent, along with the Hull patent, put GE on what seemed to be firm legal ground, although it faced years of legal challenges from Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., which claimed infringement on patents that it held.

Even though the patent issue was not completely resolved for many years, General Electric&#x27;s strength in manufacturing and marketing gave it a pre-eminent position in the emerging fluorescent light market. Sales of &quot;fluorescent lumiline lamps&quot; commenced in 1938 when four different sizes of tubes were put on the market. They were used in fixtures manufactured by three leading corporations: Lightolier, Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation, and Globe Lighting. The Slimline fluorescent ballast&#x27;s public introduction in 1946 was by Westinghouse and General Electric and Showcase/Display Case fixtures were introduced by Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation in 1946. During the following year, GE and Westinghouse publicized the new lights through exhibitions at the New York World&#x27;s Fair and the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Fluorescent lighting systems spread rapidly during World War II as wartime manufacturing intensified lighting demand. By 1951 more light was produced in the United States by fluorescent lamps than by incandescent lamps.

In the first years zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium was used as greenish phosphor. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue portion of the spectrum, yielding acceptable white. After the discovery that beryllium was toxic, halophosphate-based phosphors dominated.

==Principles of operation==
The fundamental mechanism for the conversion of electrical energy to light is the emission of a photon when an electron in a mercury atom falls from an excited state into a lower energy level. Electrons flowing in the arc collide with the mercury atoms. If the incident electron has enough kinetic energy, it transfers energy to the atom&#x27;s outer electron, causing that electron to temporarily jump up to a higher energy level that is not stable. The atom will emit an ultraviolet photon as the atom&#x27;s electron reverts to a lower, more stable, energy level. Most of the photons that are released from the mercury atoms have wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum, predominantly at wavelengths of 253.7 and 185 nanometers (nm). These are not visible to the human eye, so ultraviolet energy is converted to visible light by the fluorescence of the inner phosphor coating. The difference in energy between the absorbed ultra-violet photon and the emitted visible light photon heats the phosphor coating.

Electric current flows through the tube in a low-pressure arc discharge. Electrons collide with and ionize noble gas atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a plasma by the process of impact ionization. As a result of avalanche ionization, the conductivity of the ionized gas rapidly rises, allowing higher currents to flow through the lamp.

The fill gas helps determine the electrical characteristics of the lamp but does not give off light itself. The fill gas effectively increases the distance that electrons travel through the tube, which allows an electron a greater chance of interacting with a mercury atom. Additionally, argon atoms, excited to a metastable state by the impact of an electron, can impart energy to a mercury atom and ionize it, described as the Penning effect. This lowers the breakdown and operating voltage of the lamp, compared to other possible fill gases such as krypton.

===Construction===
A fluorescent lamp tube is filled with a mix of argon, xenon, neon, or krypton, and mercury vapor. The pressure inside the lamp is around 0.3% of atmospheric pressure. The partial pressure of the mercury vapor alone is about 0.8 Pa (8 millionths of atmospheric pressure), in a T12 40-watt lamp. The inner surface of the lamp is coated with a fluorescent coating made of varying blends of metallic and rare-earth phosphor salts. The lamp&#x27;s electrodes are typically made of coiled tungsten and are coated with a mixture of barium, strontium and calcium oxides to improve thermionic emission.

Fluorescent lamp tubes are often straight and range in length from about for miniature lamps, to for high-output lamps. Some lamps have a circular tube, used for table lamps or other places where a more compact light source is desired. Larger U-shaped lamps are used to provide the same amount of light in a more compact area, and are used for special architectural purposes. Compact fluorescent lamps have several small-diameter tubes joined in a bundle of two, four, or six, or a small diameter tube coiled in a helix, to provide a high amount of light output in minimal volume.

Light-emitting phosphors are applied as a paint-like coating to the inside of the tube. The organic solvents are allowed to evaporate, then the tube is heated to nearly the melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds and fuse the coating to the lamp tube. Careful control of the grain size of the suspended phosphors is necessary; large grains lead to weak coatings, and small particles lead to poor light maintenance and efficiency. Most phosphors perform best with a particle size around 10 micrometers. The coating must be thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc, but not so thick that the phosphor coating absorbs too much visible light. The first phosphors were synthetic versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals, with small amounts of metals added as activators. Later other compounds were discovered, allowing differing colors of lamps to be made.

Fluorescent tubes can have an outer silicone coating applied by dipping the tube into a solution of water and silicone, and then drying the tube. This coating gives the tube a silky surface finish, and protects against moisture, guaranteeing a predictable surface resistance on the tube when starting it.

===Ballasts ===
Fluorescent lamps are negative differential resistance devices, so as more current flows through them, the electrical resistance of the fluorescent lamp drops, allowing for even more current to flow. Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a fluorescent lamp would rapidly self-destruct because of the uncontrolled current flow. To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use a ballast to regulate the current flow through the lamp.

The terminal voltage across an operating lamp varies depending on the arc current, tube diameter, temperature, and fill gas. A general lighting service T12 lamp operates at 430 mA, with 100 volts drop. High-output lamps operate at 800 mA, and some types operate up to 1.5 A. The power level varies from 33 to 82 watts per meter of tube length (10 to 25 W/ft) for T12 lamps.

The simplest ballast for alternating current (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type of ballast is common in 220–240V countries (And in North America, up to 30W lamps). Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. In North America, the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, so the ballast is often a step-up autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (to limit current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.
Fluorescent lamps can run directly from a direct current (DC) supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume about as much power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates at one end of the tube. Fluorescent lamps are (almost) never operated directly from DC for those reasons. Instead, an inverter converts the DC into AC and provides the current-limiting function as described below for electronic ballasts.

===Effect of temperature===

The performance of fluorescent lamps is critically affected by the temperature of the bulb wall and its effect on the partial pressure of the mercury vapor within. Since mercury condenses at the coolest spot in the lamp, careful design is required to maintain that spot at the optimum temperature, around .

Using an amalgam with some other metal reduces the vapor pressure and increases the optimum temperature range. The bulb wall &quot;cold spot&quot; temperature must still be controlled to prevent condensing. High-output fluorescent lamps have features such as a deformed tube or internal heat-sinks to control cold spot temperature and mercury distribution. Heavily loaded small lamps, such as compact fluorescent lamps, also include heat-sink areas in the tube to maintain mercury vapor pressure at the optimum value.

===Losses===

Only a fraction of the electrical energy input into a lamp is converted to useful light. The ballast dissipates some heat; electronic ballasts may be around 90% efficient. A fixed voltage drop occurs at the electrodes, which also produces heat. Some of the energy in the mercury vapor column is also dissipated, but about 85% is turned into visible and ultraviolet light.

Not all the UV radiation striking the phosphor coating is converted to visible light; some energy is lost. The largest single loss in modern lamps is due to the lower energy of each photon of visible light, compared to the energy of the UV photons that generated them (a phenomenon called Stokes shift). Incident photons have an energy of 5.5 electron volts but produce visible light photons with energy around 2.5 electron volts, so only 45% of the UV energy is used; the rest is dissipated as heat.

===Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps=== 


Most fluorescent lamps use electrodes that emit electrons into the tube by heat, known as hot cathodes. However, cold cathode tubes have cathodes that emit electrons only due to the large voltage between the electrodes. The cathodes will be warmed by current flowing through them, but are not hot enough for significant thermionic emission. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This makes them desirable for long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.

Cold cathode lamps are generally less efficient than thermionic emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. Power dissipated due to cathode fall voltage does not contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes. The increased power dissipation at tube ends also usually means cold cathode tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their thermionic emission equivalents. Given the higher tube voltage required anyway, these tubes can easily be made long, and even run as series strings. They are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage, and can also be instantly switched on or off.

===Starting===

The gas used in the fluorescent tube must be ionized before the arc can &quot;strike&quot; . For small lamps, it does not take much voltage to strike the arc and starting the lamp presents no problem, but larger tubes require a substantial voltage (in the range of a thousand volts). Many different starting circuits have been used. The choice of circuit is based on cost, AC voltage, tube length, instant versus non-instant starting, temperature ranges and parts availability.

====Preheating====
Preheating, also called switchstart, uses a combination filament–cathode at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic) switch (see circuit diagram to the right) that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them; after a short preheating time the starting switch opens. If timed correctly relative to the phase of the supply AC, this causes the ballast to induce a voltage over the tube high enough to initiate the starting arc. These systems are standard equipment in 200–240 V countries (and in the United States lamps up to about 30 watts).
Before the 1960s, four-pin thermal starters and manual switches were used. A glow switch starter automatically preheats the lamp cathodes. It consists of a normally open bi-metallic switch in a small sealed gas-discharge lamp containing inert gas (neon or argon). The glow switch will cyclically warm the filaments and initiate a pulse voltage to strike the arc; the process repeats until the lamp is lit. Once the tube strikes, the impinging main discharge keeps the cathodes hot, permitting continued electron emission. The starter switch does not close again because the voltage across the lit tube is insufficient to start a glow discharge in the starter.

With glow switch starters a failing tube will cycle repeatedly. Some starter systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset.

A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.

Electronic starters use a different method to preheat the cathodes. They may be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters. They use a semiconductor switch and &quot;soft start&quot; the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life. This is claimed to prolong lamp life by a factor of typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use, and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. While the circuit is complex, the complexity is built into an integrated circuit chip. Electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds), or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds. The faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up.

Electronic starters only attempt to start a lamp for a short time when power is initially applied, and do not repeatedly attempt to restrike a lamp that is dead and unable to sustain an arc; some automatically stop trying to start a failed lamp. This eliminates the re-striking of a lamp and the continuous flashing of a failing lamp with a glow starter. Electronic starters are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically, although they may fail like any other electronic circuit. Manufacturers typically quote lives of 20 years, or as long as the light fitting.

====Instant start====

&quot;Instant start&quot; fluorescent tubes were invented in 1944. Instant start simply uses a high enough voltage to break down the gas column and thereby start arc conduction. Once the high-voltage spark &quot;strikes&quot; the arc, the current is boosted until a glow discharge forms. As the lamp warms and pressure increases, the current continues to rise and both resistance and voltage falls, until mains or line-voltage takes over and the discharge becomes an arc. These tubes have no filaments and can be identified by a single pin at each end of the tube (for common lamps; compact cold-cathode lamps may also have a single pin, but operate from a transformer rather than a ballast). The lamp holders have a &quot;disconnect&quot; socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent electric shock. Instant-start lamps are slightly more energy efficient than rapid start, because they do not constantly send a heating current to the cathodes during operation, but the cold cathodes starting increases sputter, and they take much longer to transition from a glow discharge to an arc during warm up, thus the lifespan is typically about half of those seen in comparable rapid-start lamps.

====Rapid start ====

Because the formation of an arc requires the thermionic emission of large quantities of electrons from the cathode, &quot;rapid start&quot; ballast designs provide windings within the ballast that continuously warm the cathode filaments. Usually operating at a lower arc voltage than the instant start design; no inductive voltage spike is produced for starting, so the lamps must be mounted near a grounded (earthed) reflector to allow the glow discharge to propagate through the tube and initiate the arc discharge via capacitive coupling. In some lamps a grounded &quot;starting aid&quot; strip is attached to the outside of the lamp glass. This ballast type is incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps because these lamps require a higher starting voltage than that of the open circuit voltage of rapid start ballasts.

====Quick-start====
Quick-start ballasts use a small auto-transformer to heat the filaments when power is first applied. When an arc strikes, the filament heating power is reduced and the tube will start within half a second. The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector in order for them to strike. Quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch, a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start ballasts are used only on 240 V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.

====Semi-resonant start====
The semi-resonant start circuit was invented by Thorn Lighting for use with T12 fluorescent tubes. This method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.

Semi-resonant start circuits are mainly restricted to use in commercial installations because of the higher initial cost of circuit components. However, there are no starter switches to be replaced and cathode damage is reduced during starting making lamps last longer, reducing maintenance costs. Because of the high open circuit tube voltage, this starting method is particularly good for starting tubes in cold locations. Additionally, the circuit power factor is almost 1.0, and no additional power factor correction is needed in the lighting installation. As the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode striking voltage (or the tubes would erroneously instant-start), this design cannot be used with AC power unless the tubes are at least length. Semi-resonant start fixtures are generally incompatible with energy saving T8 retrofit tubes, because such tubes have a higher starting voltage than T12 lamps and may not start reliably, especially in low temperatures. Recent proposals in some countries to phase out T12 tubes will reduce the application of this starting method.

====Electronic ballasts====

Electronic ballasts employ transistors to change the supply frequency into high-frequency AC while regulating the current flow in the lamp. These ballasts take advantage of the higher efficacy of lamps, which rises by almost 10% at , compared to efficacy at normal power frequency. When the AC period is shorter than the relaxation time to de-ionize mercury atoms in the discharge column, the discharge stays closer to optimum operating condition. Electronic ballasts convert supply frequency AC power to variable frequency AC. The conversion can reduce lamp brightness modulation at twice the power supply frequency.

Low cost ballasts contain only a simple oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. This principle is called the current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1 kV and the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.

More complex electronic ballasts use programmed start. The output frequency is started above the resonance frequency of the output circuit of the ballast; and after the filaments are heated, the frequency is rapidly decreased. If the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the ballast, the output voltage will increase so much that the lamp will ignite. If the lamp does not ignite, an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast.

Many electronic ballasts are controlled by a microcontroller, and these are sometimes called digital ballasts. Digital ballasts can apply quite complex logic to lamp starting and operation. This enables functions such as testing for broken electrodes and missing tubes before attempting to start, detection of tube replacement, and detection of tube type, such that a single ballast can be used with several different tubes. Features such as dimming can be included in the embedded microcontroller software, and can be found in various manufacturers&#x27; products.

Since introduction in the 1990s, high-frequency ballasts have been used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps. These ballasts convert the incoming power to an output frequency in excess of . This increases lamp efficiency. These ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts, requiring some consideration in housing design, and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the wire leads from the ballast to the lamp ends.

===End of life===
The life expectancy of a fluorescent lamp is primarily limited by the life of the cathode electrodes. To sustain an adequate current level, the electrodes are coated with an emission mixture of metal oxides. Every time the lamp is started, and during operation, a small amount of the cathode coating is sputtered off the electrodes by the impact of electrons and heavy ions within the tube. The sputtered material collects on the walls of the tube, darkening it. The starting method and frequency affect cathode sputtering. A filament may also break, disabling the lamp. 

Low-mercury designs of lamps may fail when mercury is absorbed by the glass tube, phosphor, and internal components, and is no longer available to vaporize in the fill gas. Loss of mercury initially causes an extended warm-up time to full light output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the argon gas takes over as the primary discharge.

Subjecting the tube to asymmetric current flow, effectively operates it under a DC bias, and causes asymmetric distribution of mercury ions along the tube. The localized depletion of mercury vapor pressure manifests itself as pink luminescence of the base gas in the vicinity of one of the electrodes, and the operating lifetime of the lamp may be dramatically shortened. This can be an issue with some poorly designed inverters.

The phosphors lining the lamp degrade with time as well, until a lamp no longer produces an acceptable fraction of its initial light output.

Failure of the integral electronic ballast of a compact fluorescent bulb will also end its usable life.

==Phosphors and the spectrum of emitted light==

The spectrum of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp is the combination of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light that is different from those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light&#x27;s spectral composition, and may be gauged by its color rendering index (CRI).

===Color temperature===
Correlated color temperature (CCT) is a measure of the &quot;shade&quot; of whiteness of a light source compared with a blackbody. Typical incandescent lighting is 2700 K, which is yellowish-white. Halogen lighting is 3000 K. Fluorescent lamps are manufactured to a chosen CCT by altering the mixture of phosphors inside the tube. Warm-white fluorescents have CCT of 2700 K and are popular for residential lighting. Neutral-white fluorescents have a CCT of 3000 K or 3500 K. Cool-white fluorescents have a CCT of 4100 K and are popular for office lighting. Daylight fluorescents have a CCT of 6500 K, which is bluish-white.

===Color rendering index===

Color rendering index (CRI) is an attempt to measure the ability of a light source to reveal the colors of various objects faithfully in comparison to a black body radiator. Colors can be perceived using light from a source, relative to light from a reference source such as daylight or a blackbody of the same color temperature. By definition, an incandescent lamp has a CRI of 100. Real-life fluorescent tubes achieve CRIs of anywhere from 50 to 98. Fluorescent lamps with low CRI have phosphors that emit too little red light. Skin appears less pink, and hence &quot;unhealthy&quot; compared with incandescent lighting. Colored objects appear muted. For example, a low CRI 6800 K halophosphate tube (an extreme example) will make reds appear dull red or even brown. Since the eye is relatively less efficient at detecting red light, an improvement in color rendering index, with increased energy in the red part of the spectrum, may reduce the overall luminous efficacy.

Lighting arrangements use fluorescent tubes in an assortment of tints of white. Mixing tube types within fittings can improve the color reproduction of lower quality tubes.

===Phosphor composition===

Some of the least pleasant light comes from tubes containing the older, calcium halophosphate phosphors (chemical formula Ca5(PO4)3(F, Cl):Sb3+, Mn2+). This phosphor mainly emits yellow and blue light, and relatively little green and red. In the absence of a reference, this mixture appears white to the eye, but the light has an incomplete spectrum. The color rendering index (CRI) of such lamps is around 60.

Since the 1990s, higher-quality fluorescent lamps use a rare-earth tri-phosphors mixture, based on europium and terbium ions, which have emission bands more evenly distributed over the spectrum of visible light, but with peaks in the red, green and blue. Triphosphor tubes give a more natural color reproduction to the human eye. The CRI of such lamps is typically 85.

==Applications==
Fluorescent lamps come in many shapes and sizes. Many compact fluorescent lamps integrate the auxiliary electronics into the base of the lamp, allowing them to fit into a regular light bulb socket.

In US residences, fluorescent lamps are mostly found in kitchens, basements, or garages. Schools and businesses find the cost savings of fluorescent lamps to be significant and rarely use incandescent lights. Electricity costs, tax incentives and building codes result in greater use in locales such as California. Fluorescent use is declining, supplanted by LED lighting, which is more energy efficient and does not contain mercury.

In other countries, residential use of fluorescent lighting varies depending on the price of energy, financial and environmental concerns of the local population, and acceptability of the light output. In East and Southeast Asia incandescent bulbs are rare in buildings.

Many countries are encouraging the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs and substitution with other types of energy-efficient lamps.

In addition to general lighting, special fluorescent lights are often used in stage lighting for film and video production. They are cooler than traditional halogen light sources, and use high-frequency ballasts to prevent video flickering and high color-rendition index lamps to approximate daylight color temperatures.

==Comparison to incandescent lamps==
===Luminous efficacy===
Fluorescent lamps convert more of the input power to visible light than incandescent lamps. A typical 100 watt tungsten filament incandescent lamp may convert only 5% of its power input to visible white light (400–700 nm wavelength), whereas typical fluorescent lamps convert about 22% of the power input to visible white light.

The efficacy of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 lumens per watt for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67 lm/W overall. Ballast loss can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.

Fluorescent lamp efficacy is dependent on lamp temperature at the coldest part of the lamp. In T8 lamps this is in the center of the tube. In T5 lamps this is at the end of the tube with the text stamped on it. The ideal temperature for a T8 lamp is while the T5 lamp is ideally at .

===Life===
Typically a fluorescent lamp will last 10 to 20 times as long as an equivalent incandescent lamp when operated several hours at a time. Under standard test conditions fluorescent lamps last 6,000 to 90,000 hours (2 to 31 years at 8 hours per day).

The higher initial cost of a fluorescent lamp compared with an incandescent lamp is usually compensated for by lower energy consumption over its life.

===Lower luminance===
Compared with an incandescent lamp, a fluorescent tube is a more diffuse and physically larger light source. In suitably designed lamps, light can be more evenly distributed without point source of glare such as seen from an undiffused incandescent filament; the lamp is large compared to the typical distance between lamp and illuminated surfaces.

===Lower heat===
Fluorescent lamps give off about one-fifth the heat of equivalent incandescent lamps. This greatly reduces the size, cost and energy consumption by air conditioning for office buildings that typically have many lights and few windows.

==Disadvantages==

===Frequent switching===
Frequent switching (more than every 3 hours) will shorten the life of lamps. Each start cycle slightly erodes the electron-emitting surface of the cathodes; when all the emission material is gone, the lamp cannot start with the available ballast voltage. Fixtures for flashing lights (such as for advertising) use a ballast that maintains cathode temperature when the arc is off, preserving the life of the lamp.

The extra energy used to start a fluorescent lamp is equivalent to a few seconds of normal operation; it is more energy-efficient to switch off lamps when not required for several minutes.

=== Mercury content ===

If a fluorescent lamp is broken, a very small amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are near the end of their life. Broken lamps may release mercury if not cleaned with correct methods.

Due to the mercury content, discarded fluorescent lamps must be treated as hazardous waste. For large users of fluorescent lamps, recycling services are available in some areas, and may be required by regulation. In some areas, recycling is also available to consumers.

===Ultraviolet emission===
Fluorescent lamps emit a small amount of ultraviolet (UV) light. A 1993 study in the US found that ultraviolet exposure from sitting under fluorescent lights for eight hours is equivalent to one minute of sun exposure. Ultraviolet radiation from compact fluorescent lamps may exacerbate symptoms in photosensitive individuals.

Museum artifacts may need protection from UV light to prevent degradation of pigments or textiles.

===Ballast===

Fluorescent lamps require a ballast to stabilize the current through the lamp, and to provide the initial striking voltage required to start the arc discharge. Often one ballast is shared between two or more lamps. Electromagnetic ballasts can produce an audible humming or buzzing noise. In North America, magnetic ballasts are usually filled with a tar-like potting compound to reduce emitted noise. Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast. Energy lost in magnetic ballasts is around 10% of lamp input power according to GE literature from 1978. Electronic ballasts reduce this loss.

===Power quality and radio interference===
Simple inductive fluorescent lamp ballasts have a power factor of less than unity. Inductive ballasts can be connected to, or may include, power factor correction capacitors. Simple electronic ballasts may also have low power factor due to their rectifier input stage.

Fluorescent lamps are a non-linear load and generate harmonic currents in the electrical power supply. The arc within the lamp may generate radio frequency noise, which can be conducted through power wiring. Suppression of radio interference is possible. Very good suppression is possible, but adds to the cost of the fluorescent fixtures.

Fluorescent lamps near end of life can present a serious radio frequency interference hazard. Oscillations are generated from the negative differential resistance of the arc, and the current flow through the tube can form a tuned circuit whose frequency depends on path length.

===Operating temperature===
Fluorescent lamps operate best around room temperature. At lower or higher temperatures, efficacy decreases. At below-freezing temperatures standard lamps may not start. Special lamps may be used for reliable service outdoors in cold weather.

===Lamp shape===
Fluorescent tubes are long, low-luminance sources compared with high intensity discharge lamps, incandescent and halogen lamps and high power LEDs. However, low luminous intensity of the emitting surface is useful because it reduces glare. Lamp fixture design must control light from a long tube instead of a compact globe. The compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) replaces regular incandescent bulbs in many light fixtures where space permits.

===Flicker ===
Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120 Hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity; they are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. 
A stroboscopic effect can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp. This effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast. Unlike a true strobe lamp, the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial &quot;blurring&quot; of the moving part would be evident.

Fluorescent lamps may produce flicker at the power supply frequency (50 or 60 Hz), which is noticeable by more people. This happens if a damaged or failed cathode results in slight rectification and uneven light output in positive and negative going AC cycles. Power frequency flicker can be emitted from the ends of the tubes, if each tube electrode produces a slightly different light output pattern on each half-cycle. Flicker at power frequency is more noticeable in the peripheral vision than it is when viewed directly.

Near the end of life, fluorescent lamps can start flickering at a frequency lower than the power frequency. This is due to instability in the negative resistance of arc discharge, which can be from a bad lamp or ballast or poor connection.

New fluorescent lamps may show a twisting spiral pattern of light in a part of the lamp. This effect is due to loose cathode material and usually disappears after a few hours of operation.

Electromagnetic ballasts may also cause problems for video recording as there can be a so-called &quot;beat effect&quot; between the video frame rate and the fluctuations in intensity of the fluorescent lamp.

Fluorescent lamps with electronic ballasts do not flicker, since above about 5 kHz, the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle, and light production becomes continuous. Operating frequencies of electronic ballasts are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls. Poor quality or faulty electronic ballasts may have considerable 100/120 Hz modulation of the light.

===Dimming===
Fluorescent light fixtures cannot be connected to dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. Some models of compact fluorescent lamps can be dimmed; in the United States, such lamps are identified as complying with UL standard 1993.

==Lamp sizes and designations==

Systematic nomenclature identifies mass-market lamps as to general shape, power rating, length, color, and other electrical and illuminating characteristics.

In the United States and Canada, lamps are typically identified by a code such as FxxTy, where F is for fluorescent, the first number (xx) indicates either the power in watts or length in inches, the T indicates that the shape of the bulb is tubular, and the last number (y) is the diameter in eighths of an inch (sometimes in millimeters, rounded-up to the nearest millimeter). Typical diameters are T12 or T38 ( inches or 38 mm) for residential lamps, T8 or T26 (1 inch or 25 mm) for commercial energy-saving lamps.

==Overdriving==
Overdriving a fluorescent lamp is a method of getting more light from each tube than is obtained under rated conditions. ODNO (Overdriven Normal Output) fluorescent tubes are generally used when there is not enough room to put in more bulbs to increase the light. The method is effective, but generates some additional issues. This technique has become popular among aquatic gardeners as a cost-effective way to add more light to their aquariums. Overdriving is done by rewiring lamp fixtures to increase lamp current; however, lamp life is reduced.

==Other fluorescent lamps==
===Black light===
Blacklights are a subset of fluorescent lamps that are used to provide UVA light (at about 360 nm wavelength). They are built in the same fashion as conventional fluorescent lamps but the glass tube is coated with a phosphor that converts the short-wave UV within the tube to long-wave UV rather than to visible light. They are used to provoke fluorescence (to provide dramatic effects using blacklight paint and to detect materials such as urine and certain dyes that would be invisible in visible light) as well as to attract insects to bug zappers. So-called &quot;blacklite blue&quot; lamps are also made from more expensive deep purple glass known as Wood&#x27;s glass rather than clear glass. The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light. This allows UV-induced fluorescence to be seen more easily (thereby allowing blacklight posters to seem much more dramatic). The blacklight lamps used in bug zappers do not require this refinement so it is usually omitted in the interest of cost; they are called simply &quot;blacklite&quot; (and not blacklite blue).

===Tanning lamp===
The lamps used in tanning beds contain a different phosphor blend (typically 3 to 5 or more phosphors) that emits both UVA and UVB, provoking a tanning response in most human skin. Typically, the output is rated as 3–10% UVB (5% most typical) with the remaining UV as UVA. These are mainly high output 100W lamps, although 160W very high output are somewhat common. One common phosphor used in these lamps is lead-activated barium disilicate, but a europium-activated strontium fluoroborate is also used. Early lamps used thallium as an activator, but emissions of thallium during manufacture were toxic.

===UVB medical lamps===
The lamps used in phototherapy contain a phosphor that emits only UVB ultraviolet light. There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306 nm, and narrowband UVB that gives 311–313 nanometer. Because of the longer wavelength, the narrowband UVB bulbs do not cause erythema in the skin like the broadband. They requires a 10–20 times higher dose to the skin and they require more bulbs and longer exposure time. The narrowband is good for psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), vitiligo, lichen planus, and some other skin diseases. The broadband is better for increasing Vitamin D3 in the body.

===Grow lamp===
Grow lamps contain phosphor blends that encourage photosynthesis, growth, or flowering in plants, algae, photosynthetic bacteria, and other light-dependent organisms. These often emit light primarily in the red and blue color range, which is absorbed by chlorophyll and used for photosynthesis in plants.

===Infrared lamps===
Lamps can be made with a lithium metaluminate phosphor activated with iron. This phosphor has peak emissions between 675 and 875 nanometers, with lesser emissions in the deep red part of the visible spectrum.

===Bilirubin lamps===
Deep blue light generated from a europium-activated phosphor is used in the light therapy treatment of jaundice; light of this color penetrates skin and helps in the breakup of excess bilirubin.

===Germicidal lamp===
Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all, making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent. Their tubes are made of fused quartz transparent to the UVC light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254 nm UVC emitted by these tubes will kill germs and the 184.45 nm far UV will ionize oxygen to ozone. Lamps labeled OF block the 184.45 nm far UV and do not produce significant ozone. In addition the UVC can cause eye and skin damage. They are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence when fitted with filters that pass the short-wave UV and block visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some EPROM erasers. Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, diameter, long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).

===Electrodeless lamp===

Electrodeless induction lamps are fluorescent lamps without internal electrodes. They have been commercially available since 1990. A current is induced into the gas column using electromagnetic induction. Because the electrodes are usually the life-limiting element of fluorescent lamps, such electrodeless lamps can have a very long service life, although they also have a higher purchase price.

===Cold-cathode fluorescent lamp===
Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps were used as backlighting for LCDs in computer monitors and televisions before the use of LED-backlit LCDs. They were also popular with computer case modders.

==Science demonstrations==

Fluorescent lamps can be illuminated by means other than a proper electrical connection. These other methods, however, result in very dim or very short-lived illumination, and so are seen mostly in science demonstrations. Static electricity or a Van de Graaff generator will cause a lamp to flash momentarily as it discharges a high-voltage capacitance. A Tesla coil will pass high-frequency current through the tube, and since it has a high voltage as well, the gases within the tube will ionize and emit light. This also works with plasma globes. Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on the intensity of the electric field.

<text>&quot;Les Six&quot; () is a name given to a group of six composers, five of them French and one Swiss, who lived and worked in Montparnasse. The name has its origins in two 1920 articles by critic Henri Collet in &quot;Comœdia&quot; (see Bibliography). Their music is often seen as a neoclassic reaction against both the musical style of Richard Wagner and the Impressionist music of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel.

The members were Georges Auric (1899–1983), Louis Durey (1888–1979), Arthur Honegger (1892–1955), Darius Milhaud (1892–1974), Francis Poulenc (1899–1963), and Germaine Tailleferre (1892–1983).

In 1917, when many theatres and concert halls were closed because of World War I, Blaise Cendrars and the painter Moïse Kisling decided to put on concerts at 6 , the studio of the painter Émile Lejeune (1885–1964). For the first of these events, the walls of the studio were decorated with canvases by Picasso, Matisse, Léger, Modigliani, and others. Music by Erik Satie, Honegger, Auric, and Durey was played. This concert gave Satie the idea of assembling a group of composers around himself to be known as &quot;, forerunners of . Soon after, Honegger suggested that Milhaud should be a part of the group, and a famous Spanish pianist named Ricardo Viñes introduced Poulenc to the group. Later, Germaine Tailleferre was slowly incorporated into the group thus establishing the Les Six.

==Les Six==
According to Milhaud:

And according to Poulenc:
But, that is only one reading of how the Groupe des Six originated. Other authors, like Ornella Volta, stressed the manoeuvrings of Jean Cocteau to become the leader of an avant-garde group devoted to music, like the cubist and surrealist groups which had sprung up in visual arts and literature shortly before, with Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, and André Breton as their key representatives. The fact that Satie had abandoned the &quot;Nouveaux jeunes&quot; less than a year after starting the group, was the &quot;gift from heaven&quot; that made it all come true for Cocteau: his 1918 publication, &quot;Le Coq et l&#x27;Arlequin&quot;, is said to have kicked it off.

After World War I, Jean Cocteau and Les Six began to frequent a bar known as &quot;La Gaya&quot; which became &quot;Le Bœuf sur le toit&quot; (The Ox on the Roof) when the establishment moved to larger quarters. As the famous ballet by Milhaud had been conceived at the old premises, the new bar took on the name of Milhaud&#x27;s ballet. On the renamed bar&#x27;s opening night, pianist Jean Wiéner played tunes by George Gershwin and Vincent Youmans while Cocteau and Milhaud played percussion. Among those in attendance were impresario Serge Diaghilev, artist Pablo Picasso, filmmaker René Clair, singer Jane Bathori, and actor and singer Maurice Chevalier. Another frequent guest was the young American composer Virgil Thomson whose compositions in subsequent years were influenced by members of Les Six.

==Collaborations==
Although the group did not exist to work on compositions collaboratively, there were six occasions, spread over 36 years, on which at least some members of the group did work together on the same project. On only one of these occasions was the entire Groupe des Six involved; in some others, composers from outside the group also participated.

Auric and Poulenc were involved in all six of these collaborations, Milhaud in five, Honegger and Tailleferre in three, but Durey in only one.

===1920: &quot;L&#x27;Album des Six&quot;===
In 1920 the group published an album of piano pieces together, known as &quot;L&#x27;Album des Six&quot;. This was the only work in which all six composers collaborated.

# &quot;Prélude&quot; (1919) – Auric
# &quot;Romance sans paroles&quot;, Op. 21 (1919) – Durey
# &quot;Sarabande&quot;, H 26 (1920) – Honegger
# &quot;Mazurka&quot; (1914) – Milhaud
# &quot;Valse in C&quot;, FP 17 (1919) – Poulenc
# &quot;Pastorale, Enjoué&quot; (1919) – Tailleferre

===1921: &quot;Les mariés de la tour Eiffel&quot;===
In 1921, five of the members jointly composed the music for Cocteau&#x27;s ballet &quot;Les mariés de la tour Eiffel&quot;, which was produced by the Ballets suédois, the rival to the Ballets Russes. Cocteau had originally proposed the project to Auric, but as Auric did not finish rapidly enough to fit into the rehearsal schedule, he then divided the work up among the other members of Les Six. Durey, who was not in Paris at the time, chose not to participate. The première was the occasion of a public scandal rivalling that of &quot;Le sacre du printemps&quot; in 1913. In spite of this, &quot;Les mariés de la tour Eiffel&quot; was in the repertoire of the Ballets suédois throughout the 1920s.

# &quot;Overture&quot; (14 July) – Auric
# &quot;Marche nuptiale&quot; – Milhaud

===1927: &quot;L&#x27;éventail de Jeanne&quot;===
In 1927, Auric, Milhaud and Poulenc, along with seven other composers who were not part of Les Six, jointly composed the children&#x27;s ballet &quot;L&#x27;éventail de Jeanne&quot;.

# &quot;Fanfare&quot; – Maurice Ravel

# &quot;Polka&quot; – Milhaud
# &quot;Pastourelle&quot; – Poulenc
# &quot;Rondeau&quot; – Auric
# Finale: &quot;Kermesse-Valse&quot; – Florent Schmitt

===1949: &quot;Mouvements du coeur&quot;===
In 1949, Auric, Milhaud and Poulenc, along with three other composers, jointly wrote &quot;Mouvements du coeur: Un hommage à la mémoire de Frédéric Chopin, 1810–1849&quot;, a suite of songs for baritone or bass and piano on words of Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin in commemoration of the centenary of the death of Frédéric Chopin.

In 1952, Auric, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and three other composers collaborated on an orchestral work called &quot;La Guirlande de Campra&quot;.

# &quot;Toccata&quot; – Honegger
# &quot;Sarabande et farandole&quot; – Daniel Lesur
# &quot;Canarie&quot; – Alexis Roland-Manuel
# &quot;Sarabande&quot; – Tailleferre
# &quot;Matelote provençale&quot; – Poulenc
# &quot;Variation&quot; – Henri Sauguet
# &quot;Écossaise&quot; – Auric

===1956: &quot;Variations sur le nom de Marguerite Long&quot;===
In 1956, Auric, Milhaud, Poulenc and five other composers created an orchestral suite in honour of the pianist Marguerite Long, called &quot;Variations sur le nom de Marguerite Long&quot;

<text>Precision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual plant and animal data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” It is used in both crop and livestock production. Precision agriculture often employs technologies to automate agricultural operations, improving their diagnosis, decision-making or performing. The goal of precision agriculture research is to define a decision support system for whole farm management with the goal of optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources.

Among these many approaches is a phytogeomorphological approach which ties multi-year crop growth stability/characteristics to topological terrain attributes. The interest in the phytogeomorphological approach stems from the fact that the geomorphology component typically dictates the hydrology of the farm field.

The practice of precision agriculture has been enabled by the advent of GPS and GNSS. The farmer&#x27;s and/or researcher&#x27;s ability to locate their precise position in a field allows for the creation of maps of the spatial variability of as many variables as can be measured (e.g. crop yield, terrain features/topography, organic matter content, moisture levels, nitrogen levels, pH, EC, Mg, K, and others). Similar data is collected by sensor arrays mounted on GPS-equipped combine harvesters. These arrays consist of real-time sensors that measure everything from chlorophyll levels to plant water status, along with multispectral imagery. This data is used in conjunction with satellite imagery by variable rate technology (VRT) including seeders, sprayers, etc. to optimally distribute resources. However, recent technological advances have enabled the use of real-time sensors directly in soil, which can wirelessly transmit data without the need of human presence.

Precision agriculture can benefit from unmanned aerial vehicles, that are relatively inexpensive and can be operated by novice pilots. These agricultural drones can be equipped with multispectral or RGB cameras to capture many images of a field that can be stitched together using photogrammetric methods to create orthophotos. These multispectral images contain multiple values per pixel in addition to the traditional red, green blue values such as near infrared and red-edge spectrum values used to process and analyze vegetative indexes such as NDVI maps. These drones are capable of capturing imagery and providing additional geographical references such as elevation, which allows software to perform map algebra functions to build precise topography maps. These topographic maps can be used to correlate crop health with topography, the results of which can be used to optimize crop inputs such as water, fertilizer or chemicals such as herbicides and growth regulators through variable rate applications.

Precision agriculture education

The agricultural industry, including teachers, is still in the relatively early stages of precision agriculture technologies. Precision agriculture has led many to believe that industry-related technologies should lead research and education instead of the other way around. In classrooms, conferences, workshops, and field days, educators of precision agriculture have struggled to keep up with the number of questions being asked. Training people to use precision agriculture technologies has proven difficult, in contrast to teaching the fundamental ideas and concepts, which have been intuitive and rather straightforward.

==History==
Precision agriculture is a key component of the third wave of modern agricultural revolutions. The first agricultural revolution was the increase of mechanized agriculture, from 1900 to 1930. Each farmer produced enough food to feed about 26 people during this time. The 1960s prompted the Green Revolution with new methods of genetic modification, which led to each farmer feeding about 156 people. It is expected that by 2050, the global population will reach about 9.6 billion, and food production must effectively double from current levels in order to feed every mouth. With new technological advancements in the agricultural revolution of precision farming, each farmer will be able to feed 265 people on the same acreage.

==Overview==
The first wave of the precision agricultural revolution came in the forms of satellite and aerial imagery, weather prediction, variable rate fertilizer application, and crop health indicators. The second wave aggregates the machine data for even more precise planting, topographical mapping, and soil data.

Precision agriculture aims to optimize field-level management with regard to:
* crop science: by matching farming practices more closely to crop needs (e.g. fertilizer inputs);
* environmental protection: by reducing environmental risks and footprint of farming (e.g. limiting leaching of nitrogen);
* economics: by boosting competitiveness through more efficient practices (e.g. improved management of fertilizer usage and other inputs).
Precision agriculture also provides farmers with a wealth of information to:
* build up a record of their farm
* improve decision-making
* foster greater traceability
* enhance marketing of farm products
* improve lease arrangements and relationships with landlords
* enhance the inherent quality of farm products (e.g. protein level in bread-flour wheat)

===Prescriptive planting===
Prescriptive planting is a type of farming system that delivers data-driven planting advice that can determine variable planting rates to accommodate varying conditions across a single field, in order to maximize yield. It has been described as &quot;Big Data on the farm.&quot; Monsanto, DuPont and others are launching this technology in the US.

==Principles==
Precision agriculture uses many tools, but some of the basics include tractors, combines, sprayers, planters, and diggers, which are all considered auto-guidance systems. The small devices on the equipment that use GIS (geographic information system) are what makes precision agriculture what it is; the GIS system can be thought of as the “brain”. To be able to use precision agriculture, the equipment needs to be wired with the right technology and data systems. More tools include Variable rate technology (VRT), Global positioning system, Geographical information system, Grid sampling, and remote sensors.

===Geolocating===
Geolocating a field enables the farmer to overlay information gathered from the analysis of soils and residual nitrogen, and information on previous crops and soil resistivity. Geolocation is done in two ways
* The field is delineated using an in-vehicle GPS receiver as the farmer drives a tractor around the field.
* The field is delineated on a basemap derived from aerial or satellite imagery. The base images must have the right level of resolution and geometric quality to ensure that geolocation is sufficiently accurate.

===Variables ===
Intra and inter-field variability may result from a number of factors. These include climatic conditions (hail, drought, rain, etc.), soils (texture, depth, nitrogen levels), cropping practices (no-till farming), weeds, and disease.
Permanent indicators—chiefly soil indicators—provide farmers with information about the main environmental constants.
Point indicators allow them to track a crop&#x27;s status, i.e., to see whether diseases are developing, if the crop is suffering from water stress, nitrogen stress, or lodging, whether it has been damaged by ice, and so on.
This information may come from weather stations and other sensors (soil electrical resistivity, detection with the naked eye, satellite imagery, etc.).
Soil resistivity measurements combined with soil analysis make it possible to measure moisture content. Soil resistivity is also a relatively simple and cheap measurement.

=== Strategies ===

Using soil maps, farmers can pursue two strategies to adjust field inputs:
* Predictive approach: based on analysis of static indicators (soil, resistivity, field history, etc.) during the crop cycle.
* Control approach: information from static indicators is regularly updated during the crop cycle by:
** sampling: weighing biomass, measuring leaf chlorophyll content, weighing fruit, etc.
** remote sensing: measuring parameters like temperature (air/soil), humidity (air/soil/leaf), wind or stem diameter is possible thanks to Wireless Sensor Networks and Internet of things (IoT)
** proxy-detection: in-vehicle sensors measure leaf status; this requires the farmer to drive around the entire field.
** aerial or satellite remote sensing: multispectral imagery is acquired and processed to derive maps of crop biophysical parameters, including indicators of disease. Airborne instruments are able to measure the amount of plant cover and to distinguish between crops and weeds.
Decisions may be based on decision-support models (crop simulation models and recommendation models) based on big data, but in the final analysis it is up to the farmer to decide in terms of business value and impacts on the environment- a role being taken over by artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on machine learning and artificial neural networks.

It is important to realize why PA technology is or is not adopted, &quot;for PA technology adoption to occur the farmer has to perceive the technology as useful and easy to use. It might be insufficient to have positive outside data on the economic benefits of PA technology as perceptions of farmers have to reflect these economic considerations.&quot;

===Implementing practices ===
New information and communication technologies make field-level crop management more operational and easier to achieve for farmers.
Application of crop management decisions calls for agricultural equipment that supports variable-rate technology (VRT), for example varying seed density along with the variable-rate application (VRA) of nitrogen and phytosanitary products.

Precision agriculture uses technology on agricultural equipment (e.g. tractors, sprayers, harvesters, etc.):
* positioning system (e.g. GPS receivers that use satellite signals to precisely determine a position on the globe);
* geographic information systems (GIS), i.e., software that makes sense of all the available data;
* variable-rate farming equipment (seeder, spreader).

==Usage around the world ==
The concept of precision agriculture first emerged in the United States in the early 1980s. In 1985, researchers at the University of Minnesota varied lime inputs in crop fields. It was also at this time that the practice of grid sampling appeared (applying a fixed grid of one sample per hectare). Towards the end of the 1980s, this technique was used to derive the first input recommendation maps for fertilizers and pH corrections. The use of yield sensors developed from new technologies, combined with the advent of GPS receivers, has been gaining ground ever since. Today, such systems cover several million hectares.

In the American Midwest (US), it is associated not with sustainable agriculture but with mainstream farmers who are trying to maximize profits by spending money only in areas that require fertilizer. This practice allows the farmer to vary the rate of fertilizer across the field according to the need identified by GPS guided Grid or Zone Sampling. Fertilizer that would have been spread in areas that do not need it can be placed in areas in need, thereby optimizing its use.

Around the world, precision agriculture developed at a varying pace. Precursor nations were the United States, Canada and Australia. In Europe, the United Kingdom was the first to go down this path, followed closely by France, where it first appeared in 1997–1998. In Latin America the leading country is Argentina, where it was introduced in the middle 1990s with the support of the National Agricultural Technology Institute. Brazil established a state-owned enterprise, Embrapa, to research and develop sustainable agriculture. The development of GPS and variable-rate spreading techniques helped to anchor precision farming management practices. Today, less than 10% of France&#x27;s farmers are equipped with variable-rate systems. Uptake of GPS is more widespread, but this hasn&#x27;t stopped them using precision agriculture services, which supplies field-level recommendation maps.

While digital technologies can transform the landscape of agricultural machinery, making mechanization both more precise and more accessible, non-mechanized production is still dominant in many low- and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Research on precision agriculture for non-mechanized production is increasing and so is its adoption. Examples include the AgroCares hand-held soil scanner, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) services (also known as drones), and GNSS to map field boundaries and establish land tenure. However, it is not clear how many agricultural producers actually use digital technologies.

Precision livestock farming supports farmers in real-time by continuously monitoring and controlling animal productivity, environmental impacts, and health and welfare parameters. Sensors attached to animals or to barn equipment operate climate control and monitor animals’ health status, movement and needs. For example, cows can be tagged with the electronic identification (EID) that allows a milking robot to access a database of udder coordinates for specific cows. Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years, but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe, and likely almost absent in low- and middle-income countries. Automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist, but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce.

The economic and environmental benefits of precision agriculture have also been confirmed in China, but China is lagging behind countries such as Europe and the United States because the Chinese agricultural system is characterized by small-scale family-run farms, which makes the adoption rate of precision agriculture lower than other countries. Therefore, China is trying to better introduce precision agriculture technology into its own country and reduce some risks, paving the way for China&#x27;s technology to develop precision agriculture in the future.

In December 2014, the Russian President made an address to the Russian Parliament where he called for a National Technology Initiative (NTI). It is divided into subcomponents such as the FoodNet initiative. The FoodNet initiative contains a set of declared priorities, such as precision agriculture. This field is of special interest to Russia as an important tool in developing elements of the bioeconomy in Russia.

==Economic and environmental impacts==
Precision agriculture, as the name implies, means the application of precise and correct amounts of inputs like water, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. at the correct time to the crop to increase its productivity and maximize its yields. Precision agriculture management practices can significantly reduce the amount of nutrient and other crop inputs used while boosting yields. Farmers thus obtain a return on their investment by saving on water, pesticide, and fertilizer costs.

The second, larger-scale benefit of targeting inputs concerns environmental impacts. Applying the right amount of chemicals in the right place and at the right time benefits crops, soils and groundwater, and thus the entire crop cycle. Consequently, precision agriculture has become a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture, since it respects crops, soils and farmers. Sustainable agriculture seeks to assure a continued supply of food within the ecological, economic and social limits required to sustain production in the long term.

A 2013 article tried to show that precision agriculture can help farmers in developing countries like India.

Precision agriculture reduces the pressure of agriculture on the environment by increasing the efficiency of machinery and putting it into use. For example, the use of remote management devices such as GPS reduces fuel consumption for agriculture, while variable rate application of nutrients or pesticides can potentially reduce the use of these inputs, thereby saving costs and reducing harmful runoff into the waterways.

GPS also reduces the amount of compaction to the ground by following previously made guidance lines. This will also allow for less time in the field and reduce the environmental impact of the equipment and chemicals.

Precision agriculture produces large quantities of varied sensing data which creates an opportunity to adapt and reuse such data for archaeology and heritage work, enhancing understanding of archaeology in contemporary agricultural landscapes.

==Emerging technologies==
Precision agriculture is an application of breakthrough digital farming technologies. Over $4.6 billion has been invested in agriculture tech companies—sometimes called agtech.

===Robots===
Self-steering tractors have existed for some time now, as John Deere equipment works like a plane on autopilot. The tractor does most of the work, with the farmer stepping in for emergencies. Technology is advancing towards driverless machinery programmed by GPS to spread fertilizer or plow land. Autonomy of technology is driven by the demanding need for diagnoses, often difficult to accomplish solely by hands-on farmer-operated machinery. In many instances of high rates of production, manual adjustments cannot be sustained. Other innovations include, partly solar powered, machines/robots that identify weeds and precisely kill them with a dose of a herbicide or lasers.

Agricultural robots, also known as AgBots, already exist, but advanced harvesting robots are being developed to identify ripe fruits, adjust to their shape and size, and carefully pluck them from branches.

===Drones and satellite imagery===
Drone and satellite technology are used in precision farming. This often occurs when drones take high-quality images while satellites capture the bigger picture. Aerial photography from light aircraft can be combined with data from satellite records to predict future yields based on the current level of field biomass. Aggregated images can create contour maps to track where water flows, determine variable-rate seeding, and create yield maps of areas that were more or less productive.

===The Internet of things===
The Internet of things is the network of physical objects outfitted with electronics that enable data collection and aggregation. IoT comes into play with the development of sensors and farm-management software. For example, farmers can spectroscopically measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in liquid manure, which is notoriously inconsistent. They can then scan the ground to see where cows have already urinated and apply fertilizer to only the spots that need it. This cuts fertilizer use by up to 30%. Moisture sensors in the soil determine the best times to remotely water plants. The irrigation systems can be programmed to switch which side of the tree trunk they water based on the plant&#x27;s need and rainfall.

Innovations are not just limited to plants—they can be used for the welfare of animals. Cattle can be outfitted with internal sensors to keep track of stomach acidity and digestive problems. External sensors track movement patterns to determine the cow&#x27;s health and fitness, sense physical injuries, and identify the optimal times for breeding. All this data from sensors can be aggregated and analyzed to detect trends and patterns.

As another example, monitoring technology can be used to make beekeeping more efficient. Honeybees are of significant economic value and provide a vital service to agriculture by pollinating a variety of crops. Monitoring of a honeybee colony&#x27;s health via wireless temperature, humidity, and sensors helps to improve the productivity of bees, and to read early warnings in the data that might threaten the very survival of an entire hive.

=== Smartphone applications ===

Smartphone and tablet applications are becoming increasingly popular in precision agriculture. Smartphones come with many useful applications already installed, including the camera, microphone, GPS, and accelerometer. There are also applications made dedicated to various agriculture applications such as field mapping, tracking animals, obtaining weather and crop information, and more. They are easily portable, affordable, and have high computing power.

=== Machine learning ===
Machine learning is commonly used in conjunction with drones, robots, and internet of things devices. It allows for the input of data from each of these sources. The computer then processes this information and sends the appropriate actions back to these devices. This allows for robots to deliver the perfect amount of fertilizer or for IoT devices to provide the perfect quantity of water directly to the soil. Machine learning may also provide predictions to farmers at the point of need, such as the contents of plant-available nitrogen in soil, to guide fertilization planning. As more agriculture becomes ever more digital, machine learning will underpin efficient and precise farming with less manual labour.

<text>Postbridge is a hamlet in the heart of Dartmoor in the English county of Devon. It lies on the B3212, roughly midway between Princetown and Moretonhampstead.

Postbridge is on the East Dart river, one of two main tributaries of the River Dart, and consists of a few houses, a shop, a pub and hotel, and a national park tourist information centre.

Postbridge is best known for its fine example of an ancient clapper bridge over the river. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross, carrying tin to the stannary town of Tavistock. The clapper bridge, a Grade II* listed structure, stands alongside a Grade II-listed bridge built in the 1780s.

The settlement is also infamous for the ghost story of the Hairy Hands, which supposedly manifest themselves on a road near the village.

<text>The North York Moors is an upland area in north-eastern Yorkshire, England. It contains one of the largest expanses of heather moorland in the United Kingdom. The area was designated as a National Park in 1952, through the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Covering an area of , the National Park has a population of 23,380. It is administered by the North York Moors National Park Authority, which is based in Helmsley.

==Location and transport==
 To the east, the area is clearly defined by the impressive cliffs of the North Sea coast. The northern and western boundaries are defined by the steep scarp slopes of the Cleveland Hills edging the Tees lowlands and the Hambleton Hills above the Vale of Mowbray. To the south lies the broken line of the Tabular Hills and the Vale of Pickering.

Four roads cross the North York Moors from north to south. In the east, the A171 joins Whitby and Scarborough. Further inland, the A169 runs between Pickering and Whitby. More centrally, a minor road departs from the A170 at Keldholme and passes through Castleton before joining the A171 which connects Whitby and Guisborough. The most westerly route is the B1257 connecting Helmsley to Stokesley. The A170 from Thirsk to Scarborough marks the southern boundary of the North York Moors area.

The Esk Valley Line is an east–west branch line rail link from Whitby to Middlesbrough in the north, and the North Yorkshire Moors steam railway runs from Pickering to Grosmont with a link to Whitby. Other public transport within the North York Moors includes a number of bus services. Yorkshire Coastliner route 840 runs from Whitby to Pickering (and continues to York and Leeds), Arriva North East routes X93 and X94 run from Scarborough to Middlesbrough via Whitby and Guisborough, Arriva North East route 95 runs from Whitby to Lealholm along the Esk Valley, and East Yorkshire route 128 connects Scarborough and Helmsley. On weekends during the summer, these are complemented by Moorsbus services, which run from local urban centres into more remote parts of the national park which are difficult to access without private transport. Some of the routes across the North York Moors are noted for their beauty – the 840 was declared Britain&#x27;s most scenic bus route by Bus Users UK while the X93 was the tenth most scenic.

The cyclists in the 2018 and 2019 Tour de Yorkshire passed through a section of the North York Moors.

==Physical geography==

The North York Moors consist of a moorland plateau, dissected by a number of deep dales or valleys containing cultivated land or woodland. The largest dale is Eskdale, the valley of the River Esk which flows from west to east and empties into the North Sea at Whitby. The Cleveland Hills rise north of Eskdale. At the western end of Eskdale, the valley divides into three smaller dales, Westerdale (the upper valley of the River Esk), Baysdale and Commondale. A series of side dales drain into Eskdale from the moorland on its southern side, from west to east Danby Dale, Little Fryup Dale, Great Fryup Dale, Glaisdale and the Goathland valley. Kildale, west of Commondale and separated only by a low watershed, is drained by the River Leven, which flows west to join the River Tees.

On their south side, the moorland is incised by a series of dales which drain into tributaries of the River Derwent. The westernmost dale is Rye Dale, to the west of which rise the Hambleton Hills. Bilsdale is a side dale of Rye Dale. East of Bilsdale Bransdale, Farndale, Rosedale and Newton Dale cut into the moorland. In the south east, the landscape is marked by the narrow valleys of the upper reaches of the Derwent and its upper tributaries.

About 23 per cent of the North York Moors is under woodland cover (mostly located to the south-west and south-east), equivalent to more than 300 square kilometres of trees. It is home to the largest concentration of ancient and veteran trees in northern England.

The Derwent crosses the Vale of Pickering flowing westwards, turns southwards at Malton and flows through the eastern part of the Vale of York before emptying into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh.

===Climate===
As part of the United Kingdom, the North York Moors area generally has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions, there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer, the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions, which can lead to drought. For its latitude, this area is milder in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the North York Moors are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area, but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coasts and moorland. Within the area, variations in climate are brought about by local differences in altitude, aspect and shelter.

Snowfall is variable from year to year, but the area gets much more snow on average than other parts of the country. Heavy falls are associated with northeasterly winds off the North Sea. Roads over the high moorland areas are notoriously prone to drifting snow due to the exposed nature of the terrain.

*215 dry days

===Geology===
 The geology of the North York Moors is dominated by rocks of the Jurassic period. They were mostly laid down in subtropical seas 205 to 142 million years ago. Fluctuations in sea level produced different rock types varying from shales to sandstones and limestones derived from coral. These marine and delta deposited rocks are well exposed on the Yorkshire coast from Staithes to Filey.

*Lower Jurassic At the beginning of the Jurassic period shales, clays and thin limestones and sandstones were deposited in a shallow sea. These deposits are many metres thick and include layers of ironstone of various thicknesses and the rocks from which alum is extracted.
*Middle Jurassic A period of gradual uplift happened when mudstone and sandstone were deposited on a low-lying coastal plain crossed by large rivers. Occasionally this land area was inundated by the sea and at these times calcareous rocks containing marine fossils were deposited. These are the Ravenscar Group of rocks. The Oxford Clay was deposited at the end of this epoch.
*Upper Jurassic Towards the end of the Jurassic period the land again sank beneath the sea. At first the sea was shallow and calcareous sandstones and limestones were deposited. These are the Corallian rocks of the Tabular Hills towards the south of the area. Overlying the Corallian rocks is the Kimmeridge Clay which underlies the Vale of Pickering but this is not exposed at the surface.
Subsequently, about 30 million years ago, the land was uplifted and tilted towards the south by earth movements. The upper layers of rock were eroded away and the older rocks were exposed in places. Because of the tilt the oldest rocks became exposed in the north. These are the bands of shales and ironstones on the northern scarp of the North York Moors and Cleveland Hills. The middle layers form the sandstones of the high moorland and the youngest layers of limestone form the Tabular Hills. In the dales, where the rivers have cut through the younger rocks, there are also exposures of older shales, ironstone and sandstone. Rosedale is an example of this.

During the Quaternary period, the last 2 million years, the area has experienced a sequence of glaciations. The most recent glaciation, the Devensian, ended about 11,000 years ago. The higher parts of the North York Moors were not covered by the ice sheets but glaciers flowed southwards on either side of the higher land mass.

As the climate became warmer at the end of the ice age, the snowfields on the North York Moors began to melt. The meltwater was unable to escape northwards, westwards or eastwards because it was blocked by ice. Huge torrents of water were forced southwards. Water from the Esk valley area flowed southwards gouging out the deep Newtondale valley as it went. Water from the North York Moors formed a vast lake in the area of the Vale of Pickering. Eventually this lake filled its basin and then overflowed at the lowest point which was at Kirkham. Here it cut the steep sided Kirkham gorge. When the ice finally retreated it left deep deposits of boulder clay (or till) behind. The boulder clay blocked the eastern end of the Vale of Pickering causing a permanent deviation in the course of the River Derwent. Alluvium from the glacial meltwater covers many areas to the north of the moors and in the Esk valley.

==Hills==
==Natural history==

The North York Moors National Park encompasses three main types of landscape, whose differences are clearly visible, and the coastal belt. There are predominantly green areas of pasture land, the purple and brown heather moorland, and woodland. The three kinds of scenery are the result of differences in the underlying geology and each supports different wildlife communities.

===Moorland===
 Sandstones erode slowly and form poor acid soils which are deficient in nutrients. They are less permeable to water, impeding drainage and encouraging the formation of bogs. Sphagnum moss bogs are common where there is abundant rain and poor drainage. Cotton grass is a distinctive plant which grows in the boggy areas. In the cold acid waters of peat bogs there is little decomposition of organic material with the result that the dead sphagnum moss gradually accumulates to form peat. This raises the levels of the bogs and they dry out. Heather then invades the area. Large areas of the moorland are now covered in heather, bilberries and grasses growing on thick layers of peat.
The acid soils and peat bogs are unsuitable for earthworms so species which usually feed on earthworms such as moles and the common shrew are absent on the moorland. The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders that live in the heather. Lapwing, curlew and redshank breed on the moorland and there are sandpipers along the streams. Wheatear and golden plovers inhabit grassier patches on the moorland and ring ouzels live in stony areas. Red grouse, which feed on young heather shoots, are abundant. The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.
About 20 per cent of the national park is covered in bracken. Few things can grow under its dense cover and it does not support many insects and is unpalatable to most animals. The bracken is extremely invasive.

Sheep are a ubiquitous part of the moorland landscape. Their grazing helps to maintain the open wild landscape that is needed for many other plants and animals to thrive.

===Limestone belt===
Limestone weathers quickly to produce nutrient rich alkaline soils on well drained rocks. Gouging by glacial meltwaters has left spectacular valleys along whose floors run streams. The limestone streams with their nutrient rich waters support an abundance of aquatic invertebrates such as insect larvae and crustaceans. These in turn support such fish as trout and grayling. Insects which emerge from the water in summer are also a rich source of food for birds. Grey wagtails, swallows and spotted flycatchers are commonly seen. Dippers and kingfishers are also typical. The otter, after a period of decline, is starting to recolonise the rivers and streams.

Farndale is famous for its wild daffodils in spring. Sheltered woodlands dominated by sessile oaks can be found to the south of the high ground. These woodland areas are the home of pied flycatchers, sparrow hawks and wood warblers. Roe and fallow deer can also be found here. The woodlands and south facing grasslands on the limestone belt provide a good habitat for many butterflies.

The fertile alkaline soils support an abundance of wild flowers. Bluebells and primroses grow in the hedgerows in spring and rarer plants such as the wood vetch and orchids are also to be found.
Adders are widespread throughout the national park. On the moors they eat common lizards and around the hedgerows and woodland edges they feed on mice and voles.

The limestone grasslands support a wide variety of wild flowers, and many rarer butterflies can be seen. Pearl-bordered fritillary, Duke of Burgundy fritillary, marbled white, dingy skipper and grayling are just some of species that inhabit the national park.

===Coast===

The cliffs and sandy bays of the northern end of the Yorkshire Coast offer an assortment of seashore habitats. An area where the Cleveland Hills meets the sea has been designated as a Heritage Coast. The cliff at Boulby, at , the highest point on the east coast of England is formed by Jurassic shales, clays and ironstones. There are also fine exposures of Jurassic rocks with their characteristic fossils around Robin Hoods Bay and Ravenscar.

Rocky shores offer an abundance of seaweeds in zones of different types which are more and less tolerant of exposure to the air and salt or clear water. Rock pools contain sea anemones, blennies, crabs and molluscs.

Sandy shores harbour a variety of plants and animals which are buried in the sand. Birds such as curlews and oyster catchers are to be seen prodding the sand to find these creatures for food. A few cormorants and fulmars breed along the coast where stonechats and rock pipits can also be spotted. Herring gulls are the commonest breeding birds and are an interesting sight nesting in the chimneys of coastal towns.

==History==
There are records of 12,000 archaeological sites and features in the North York Moors National Park of which 700 are scheduled monuments. Radio carbon dating of pollen grains preserved in the moorland peat provides a record of the actual species of plants that existed at various periods in the past.

About 10,000 years ago, the cold climate of the ice age ameliorated and temperatures rose above growing point of . Plant life was gradually re-established and animals and humans also returned.

===Mesolithic===
Around 8,000 BC, Britain was still part of the European landmass, and communities of Middle Stone Age people migrated to England and began to inhabit the North York Moors. Relics of this early hunting, gathering and fishing community have been found as a widespread scattering of flint tools and the barbed flint flakes used in arrows and spears.

===Neolithic===
By 5000 BC, as global sea levels rose and the North Sea came into existence, Britain was cut off from mainland Europe. During the New Stone Age, which lasted from around 4500 to 2000 BC, the population increased and agriculture was adopted. These early farmers were the first to destroy the forest cover of the moors. Their settlements were concentrated in the fertile parts of the limestone belt and these areas have been continuously farmed ever since. The Neolithic farmers grew crops, kept animals, made pottery and were highly skilled at making stone implements. They buried their dead in long low burial mounds.

===Bronze Age===
Around 2000 BC, the early Bronze Age Beaker People inhabited the Moors. During a 1,400 year period, these people inhabited all areas of the Moors and finally destroyed much of the original forest. The climate was relatively warmer and drier at this time so it was possible to live on the high moors throughout the year. When a piece of land was exhausted of nutrients, these people moved on, leaving behind land that was incapable of supporting anything but a heathland vegetation. There are about 3,000 Bronze Age burial mounds on the moors.

===Iron Age===
The Iron Age dates from about 600 BC. There are remains of two promontory hill forts at Boltby Scar and Roulston Scar and a collection of circular stone hut foundations on Percy Rigg. Other evidence of Iron Age occupation is scarce, having been obliterated by subsequent agricultural activity.

===Roman===

By 71 AD, the Roman army had reached Yorkshire, where they established a fort at Malton. Wade&#x27;s Causeway may have been one of the several Roman roads which radiated from this point. It led north-eastwards over the Vale of Pickering and across Wheeldale Moor towards the North Sea coast. There are Roman camps at Cawthorn and Lease Rigg near Grosmont and signal stations along the coast at Filey, Scarborough, Ravenscar, Goldsborough and Hunt Cliff. The Romans left Britain in 410 AD.

===Anglo-Saxon and Viking===
After the departure of the Romans, Germanic tribes arrived and settled in the area. These Angles, Saxons and Jutes gave many of the place names to villages on the moors. They worshipped a number of gods, notably Woden. However, Christianity came to Yorkshire when King Edwin of Northumbria was baptised in 627 AD at York. Christian monasteries were established at Lastingham in 654 and Whitby in 657. A nunnery was built at Hackness in 680.

In the 9th century, Viking raiders began to attack the Yorkshire coast, and in 867 these Danes destroyed the religious houses at Whitby, Lastingham and Hackness and after battle set up a new Danish kingdom based at York. The Danes settled in the area and later themselves became Christian. They introduced their language, elements of which still remain in the local dialect, and renamed a number of settlements.

===Middle Ages===
King William I of England and his Norman barons took control of the nation in 1066. Central to the imposition of Norman rule was the building of castles. There are well-preserved castle ruins at Helmsley, Pickering and Scarborough and others existed at Ayton, Danby, Mulgrave and Whorlton. In the 11th and 12th centuries monasteries were established on the moors at Whitby Abbey, Rievaulx Abbey, Byland Abbey and Mount Grace Priory. Gifts of land and money were bestowed on these establishments and the monastic orders became notable landowners, eventually owning about a third of the land in the area. The abbeys managed their land as sheep farms and became very rich on the profits. They continued to take in land from the waste and what remained of the forest and in the process gave the moors the distinctive landscape that still remains. Between 1536 and 1541, Henry VIII of England dissolved the monasteries, and confiscated and sold off their property. This was bought by individual people, some rich, but also some who had been tenants of the monasteries, and became privately owned land.

===Post-medieval===
In many areas of the moors and their associated dales the settlements took the form of isolated farms and hamlets rather than villages. Very few had an open field system of agriculture so Enclosure Acts were rarer than in other parts of England. The 17th century saw a major acceleration in the reclaiming of marginal waste land and in the eighteenth century forward looking landlords attempted to improve their lands using drainage schemes and fertilisation measures.

===19th century===
In the 19th century railways were built from Pickering to Whitby (1836), Middlesbrough to Whitby (1868) and Scarborough to Whitby (1884).

Locally sourced iron ore has been processed on the North York Moors from medieval times. In the 19th century it became a boom industry. Dozens of ironstone mines and several short-lived blast furnaces were constructed. Between 1856 and 1926 high-grade magnetic ironstone was mined in Rosedale. A railway was built around the top of the dale to serve the mines, and kilns were built to process the ore. In two decades the population of the valley rose from 558 to nearly 3000. Poor-quality coal was mined in many places on the moors from the 18th century to the early 20th century.

The North York Moors is the only source for British jet. It has been mined in the area from prehistoric times but the industry grew in the middle of the 19th century in response to a fashion for the jewellery produced from it. In the 1880s cheap imports produced a decline in the industry which was focused on Whitby. The remains of alum quarries are to be found to the north of the area and along the coast. Alum was important to the textile industry because it was used as a mordant or fixative for dyes that were used to colour cloth. The industry thrived in the region from the early 17th century until 1871. Its decline came when chemical dyes were discovered. The scars of industrial activity on the moors make it an interesting area in which to pursue industrial archaeology.

==Economy==
The area&#x27;s economy is mainly founded on tourism and agriculture.

===Agriculture===

For over a thousand years the basis of the economy in the North York Moors was agriculture. The rural scene, which attracts millions of visitors to the park each year, has been formed and maintained by generations of farmers. The 1996 Agricultural Census recorded a total workforce of 2,913 employed on 1,342 working farms. Sheep and cattle provide the prime source of farm income. The dale farms have rights to graze sheep on the open moor. The rights to moorland grazing are often essential to the economic viability of a farm. In recent years agriculture in Britain has suffered economic setbacks and the viability of hill farming has become questionable. A number of environmental schemes to improve farm incomes have been devised but the industry continues to decline.

Agricultural use of the moors is shared with grouse shooting as a means of gaining financial return from the vast expanse of heather. There is richer farmland across the southern limestone belt, where there are arable and mixed farms as well as the livestock farms. The main arable crops are barley, wheat, oilseed rape, potatoes, and sugar beets. There is also some intensive production of pigs and poultry.
===Tourism===

Many visitors to the North York Moors are engaged in outdoor pursuits, particularly walking; the National Park has a network of public rights of way almost in length, and most of the areas of open moorland are open access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Popular named walks include the Cleveland Way, which circles the North York Moors, including a coastal section; and the Lyke Wake Walk, which leads directly across the heart of the National Park. The route of the White Rose Way, a long distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough also passes through.

The area also offers opportunities for cycling, mountain biking, and horse-riding, including a circular long distance bridle route created around the North York Moors which can be accessed at a number of locations. The steep escarpments that define the edges of the National Park on three sides are used by several gliding clubs.

In late 2020, the National Park was named as an International Dark Sky Reserve. This honour confirms that the area has &quot;low levels of light pollution with good conditions for astronomy&quot;.

The National Park has two visitor centres which have tourist information and exhibitions, as well as a contemporary gallery. These are at:

* Sutton Bank
* The Moors National Park Centre, Danby

===Entertainment===
The North York Moors have not changed much in the past 50 years, and are often used as a location for British television programmes and films. The series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and the scenes of Hogsmeade Station in the Harry Potter movies were filmed in Goathland. 

The film version of Downton Abbey shot some scenes at the Pickering station of North Yorkshire Moors Railway. &quot;The Runaways&quot; with Mark Addy (2020), &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; with
Colin Firth and Julie Walters (2020) and &quot;Miss Willoughby and the Haunted Bookshop&quot;
with Kelsey Grammer, Caroline Quentin and Nathalie Cox (2020) were all partly filmed in the National Park.

Dalby Forest is also host to many forms of entertainment throughout the year including outdoor concerts.

===Communities===
There are few major settlements within, or around, the National Park: Helmsley, Pickering, Kirkbymoorside, Guisborough, Stokesley, Northallerton and Whitby. The North York Moors are within a reasonable distance of Redcar and form part of East Cleveland, and are within 20 minutes&#x27; driving time from central Middlesbrough and Scarborough.

<text>Sliver is an erotic novel by the American writer Ira Levin, first published in 1991. The story follows a group of mysterious people in a privately owned high-rise apartment building in New York City after an attractive young woman moves in. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993. Directed by Phillip Noyce and written by Joe Eszterhas, it starred Sharon Stone, William Baldwin, Polly Walker and Tom Berenger.

==Plot summary==
Kay Norris, a book editor, moves into a Manhattan &quot;sliver” building. Tall and slender, it has only two apartments on each floor. She meets a handsome and friendly fellow occupant. Norris does not know at first that the young man is the owner. He turns out to be a modern-day “peeping tom” who secretly had surveillance cameras and microphones installed in every apartment, with his own place in the building serving as his headquarters. Norris soon becomes embroiled in a murder mystery, and finds herself in danger.

==Reception==
Carolyn See&#x27;s review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; observed the book&#x27;s heroine &quot;lives such a blameless life...that it comes as a refreshing relief when the voyeur insinuates his way into her real life--even though we all know that no good can come of it.&quot; See concluded that &quot;&#x27;Sliver,&#x27; on the horror graph, comes in at about the level of a hot fudge sundae.&quot;

<doc id="144075" wikidata="Q7309709" url="?curid=144075" title="Regulatory takings in the United States">
<text>In United States constitutional law, a regulatory taking occurs when the government does not take physical possession of private property, but regulates the owner&#x27;s right to use, develop, or exclude to such a degree that the government is deemed to have &quot;taken&quot; it. Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution governments are required to pay just compensation for such takings. The amendment is incorporated to the states via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

Regulatory takings jurisprudence has its roots in Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes&#x27; opinion in &quot;Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon&quot; (1922) which stated that: &quot;The general rule, at least, is that, if regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking for which compensation must be paid.&quot;

Modern jurisprudence to determine whether a regulatory taking has occurred centers around the ad hoc factor-based test that the Supreme Court of the United States laid out in &quot;Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City&quot; (1978). Courts are to consider the economic impact of the governmental regulation, the extent to which the regulation interferes with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action. It is characterized as a disorganized test.

==Supreme Court jurisprudence==

=== &quot;Pennsylvania Coal&quot; ===
In 1922, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon&quot; that governmental regulations that went &quot;too far&quot; were a taking. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing for the majority of the court, stated that &quot;[t]he general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.&quot; Before the court, was a Pennsylvanian law that forbade all mining under inhabited land. The Court held this law to be a taking of the coal owned by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.

The early mining operations often removed so much of the underground coal that the mines became a hazard to the miners underground and to those residing on the surface. For this reason, the Pennsylvania legislature acted to limit the amount of material that could be removed from the mines below in order to leave sufficient underground support below. &quot;Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon&quot; involved an action by an individual landowner who sought to prevent a mining operation from violating this law, undermining his or her home. Under Pennsylvania law, the deed also conveyed the right to surface support to the coal company which could thus remove subsurface coal even if that caused subsidence. The coal companies argued in &quot;Pennsylvania Coal&quot; that they had acquired a right to mine the coal and the right to allow the surface to collapse because these rights had been purchased from the original landowners. The owner&#x27;s deed conveyed the surface but in express terms reserved the right to remove all the coal. The state and the surface landowners argued that the right to cause surface collapse was not property. The deed provided that the grantee takes the premises with that risk and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. The coal company essentially owned a property right to mine as much as it wished. Over a dissent by Justice Brandeis, the court ruled that Pennsylvania&#x27;s statute deprived the coal companies of the right to mine their coal.

The Holmes opinion is considered one of the most important opinions in the history of takings law.

=== &quot;Penn Central&quot; ===
The &quot;polestar&quot; of regulatory takings jurisprudence is &quot;Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City&quot; (1973). In &quot;Penn Central&quot;, the Court denied a takings claim brought by the owner of Grand Central Terminal following refusal of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to approve plans for construction of 50-story office building over Grand Central Terminal. Penn Central contended that under the New York Historical Preservation Law, it was entitled to derive a net income from Grand Central Terminal, but the city&#x27;s regulation had forced it into an indefinite deficit condition. The trial court agreed but its decision was reversed on appeal. 

The U.S. Supreme Court held that: the owners could not establish a &quot;taking&quot; merely by showing that they had been denied the right to exploit the superadjacent airspace, irrespective of the remainder of the parcel; the fact that the law affected some owners more severely than others did not itself result in a &quot;taking,&quot; and that the law did not interfere with owners&#x27; present use or prevent it from realizing a reasonable rate of return on its investment, especially since preexisting air rights were transferable to other parcels in the vicinity, which acted as a form of compensation for the claimed taking of air rights.

The court laid out a three-part ad hoc test to consider whether a regulatory taking had occurred: 

# the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,
# the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations and
# the character of the governmental action.

These factors have been criticized because the court failed to provide guidance as to exactly what they mean, what must be proven to establish a taking using them as a test, and whether all three, two, or any one of them is sufficient to show a taking.

==== Investment-backed expectations factor ====
The investment-backed expectations factor has largely been unclear. In &quot;Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.&quot;, the Supreme Court stated that &quot;those who do business in the regulated field cannot object if the legislative scheme is buttressed by subsequent amendments to achieve the legislative end.&quot; However, in &quot;Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,&quot; Justice Scalia&#x27;s opinion for the majority of the court suggested that the expectations were on &quot;how the owner&#x27;s reasonable expectations have been shaped by the State&#x27;s law of property.&quot;&quot;&quot;

==== Character of the governmental action ====
The character of the governmental action can immediately determine whether the regulation is a taking. For instance, a taking has occurred when a government regulation creates a permanent physical occupation of a landowner&#x27;s property. This rule comes from &quot;Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.&quot; which found that a New York law that required property owners to have cable television wires on their property was a taking which required just compensation.

===Regulatory restriction on use of property===
In contrast, a regulation restricting the use of property to further legitimate public ends, will not be considered a taking merely because it impairs the value or the utility of that land. However, when the regulation goes too far (as Justice Holmes put it in &quot;Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon&quot;), it will be judicially recognized as the equivalent of a taking which may not take place without payment of just compensation to the property&#x27;s owner.

The issue of regulatory takings arises from the interaction between exercise of the traditional police power and exercise of eminent domain. The police power is the inherent state government power, to do what is reasonably necessary to promote and protect public health, safety, welfare and morals.

There are numerous instances where the Supreme Court of the United States has found that state courts have reasonably concluded that &quot;the health, safety, morals, or general welfare&quot; would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land. And in this context the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld land-use regulations that adversely affected recognized real property interests.

Zoning laws are the classic example; see &quot;Hadacheck v. Sebastian&quot;, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (prohibition of brickyard operations within certain neighborhoods); &quot;Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.&quot;, 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (prohibition of industrial use); &quot;Gorieb v. Fox&quot;, 274 U.S. 603, 608 (1927) (requirement that portions of parcels be left unbuilt); &quot;Welch v. Swasey&quot;, 214 U.S. 91 (1909) (height restriction), which have been viewed as permissible governmental action even when prohibiting the most beneficial use of the property.

However, zoning restrictions may not deny an owner &quot;all&quot; economically viable use of his land. Suppose a &quot;low density residential&quot; zone requires that a house have a setback (the distance from the edge of the property to the edge of the building) of no less than 100 feet (30 m). If a particular property were only 100 feet (30 m) deep, it would be impossible to build a house on the property.

Governmental land-use regulations that deny the property owner all economically viable use are deemed a taking of the affected property. See, e.g., &quot;Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council&quot;, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), &quot;First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles&quot; (1987). The general approach to this question was summed up in &quot;Agins v. City of Tiburon&quot;, 447 U.S. 255 (1980), which states that the application of land-use regulations to a particular piece of property is a taking only &quot;if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests ... or denies an owner economically viable use of his land.&quot; However, in &quot;Lingle v. Chevron&quot;, 544 U.S. 528 (2005), the Supreme Court overruled the &quot;substantially advance&quot; criterion of a taking. When a government regulation effects a taking of private property by such excessive regulation, the owner may initiate inverse condemnation proceedings to recover the just compensation for the taking of his or her property, provided that procedural hurdles have been overcome.

In the early twenty-first century, the concept of regulatory taking became more loosely used—outside the constitutional sense—by property rights groups, extending to include regulations that reduce property values by lesser amounts. Ballot initiatives based on this interpretation (such as Oregon&#x27;s Measure 37) were advanced in at least seven states in the years 2000 to 2006. All these states are in the American west, but a significant portion of the funding for the initiatives came from sources on the east coast.

===Inverse condemnation===
Inverse condemnation is a term which describes a claim brought against the government in which a property owner seeks compensation for a `taking&#x27; of his property under the Fifth Amendment. In states that prohibit uncompensated taking or damaging, physical damage to property is included in this definition. The term &quot;inverse&quot; is used, because usually condemnations are brought by the government. In the inverse condemnation context, it is the property owner who sues the government, alleging a taking (or damaging) of property without just compensation. See &quot;San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. City of San Diego&quot;, 450 U.S. 621, 638 n.2 (1981) (Justice Brennan dissenting); &quot;United States v. Clarke&quot;, 445 U.S. 253, 257 (1980); &quot;Agins v. City of Tiburon&quot;, 447 U.S. 255, 258 n.2 (1980).

==Constitutional history==
===Legal tender cases===
An early case involving interpretation of the Fifth Amendment was the &quot;Legal Tender Cases&quot;, 79 U.S. 457 (1870) During the American Civil War, the Legal Tender Acts of 1862 and 1863 made paper money a legal substitute for gold and silver, including for the payment of preexisting debts. In &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot;, the Supreme Court had found the legal tender laws inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution, which prohibited the states from passing &quot;any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts.&quot; Moreover, the Court had held that an act compelling holders of contracts that called for payment in gold or silver to accept as legal tender &quot;mere promises to pay dollars&quot; was unconstitutional because it deprived &quot;such persons of property without due process of law&quot; under the Fifth Amendment. The Court until this time had rarely found an act of Congress unconstitutional. In 1871, the Court, with two new justices on the bench, reversed itself in the legal tender cases, &quot;Knox v. Lee&quot; and &quot;Parker v. Davis&quot;, and declared the Legal Tender Acts constitutional. The Fifth Amendment does not apply to injuries which flow from the exercise of lawful power, the court held, but only to direct appropriation of property.

The fifth amendment. ... forbids taking private property for public use without just compensation or due process of law. That provision has always been understood as referring only to a direct appropriation, and not to consequential injuries resulting from the exercise of lawful power. It has never been supposed to have any bearing upon, or to inhibit laws that indirectly work harm and loss to individuals. A new tariff, an embargo, a draft, or a war may inevitably bring upon individuals great losses; may, indeed, render valuable property almost valueless. They may destroy the worth of contracts. But whoever supposed that, because of this, a tariff could not be charged, or a non-intercourse act, or an embargo be enacted, or a war be declared?

===Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence===
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution extended the protection against uncompensated takings to citizens against their own states. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment states:

All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Early on, the federal courts began the process of gradual incorporation of the bill of rights protections into the fourteenth amendment. The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment has historically been a major vehicle for the increased federal judicial review of the constitutionality of state activity. We find early justices of the Supreme Court puzzling over this, for example, in &quot;Mugler v. Kansas&quot;, 123 U.S. 623 (1887):

 It is not a little remarkable that, while this provision has been in the constitution of the United States as a restraint upon the authority of the federal government for nearly a century, and while during all that time the manner in which the powers of that government have been exercised has been watched with jealousy, and subjected to the most rigid criticism in all its branches, this special limitation upon its powers has rarely been invoked in the judicial forum or the more enlarged theater of public discussion. But while it has been a part of the constitution as a restraint upon the powers of the states only a very few years, the docket of this court is crowded with cases in which we are asked to hold that state courts and state legislatures have deprived their own citizens of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. There is here abundant evidence that there exists some strange misconception of the scope of the provision as found in the fourteenth amendment. In fact, it would seem from the character of many of the cases before us, and the arguments made in them, that the clause under consideration is looked upon as a means of bringing to the test of the decision of this court the abstract opinions of every unsuccessful litigant in a state court of justice of the decision against him, and of the merits of the legislation on which such a decision may be founded.

===The Bituminous Coal Association case===
Some 65 years later, the Court considered similar Pennsylvania legislation which required that some underground coal be left in place to provide surface support. In the Bituminous Coal case, the State&#x27;s legislation received a more sympathetic hearing from the Court in &quot;Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass&#x27;n. v. DeBenedictis&quot;, 480 U.S. 470 (1987). The Court wrote:

 ... [T]he character of the governmental action involved here leans heavily against finding a taking; the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has acted to arrest what it perceives to be a significant threat to the common welfare. [t]here is no record in this case to support a finding, similar to the one the Court made in Pennsylvania Coal, that the Subsidence Act makes it impossible for petitioners to profitably engage in their business. ... 

The Keystone decision is characterized by deference to the State&#x27;s determination that its legislation promoted public health and safety:

Under our system of government, one of the State&#x27;s primary ways of preserving the public weal is restricting the uses individuals can make of their property. While each of us is burdened somewhat by such restrictions, we, in turn, benefit greatly from the restrictions that are placed on others. These restrictions are &quot;properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship&quot;.

Notably, the Keystone decision bears four dissents: Justices Rehnquist, Powell, O&#x27;Connor and Scalia.

===Health and safety takings===
Suppose the government must cut a firebreak through a forest upon private property to prevent spread of a forest fire. Or suppose the government destroys healthy livestock in a quarantine area to prevent spread of disease. These are invasive takings, but they do not fall under the per se rule described in a previous section. From the very first, the takings cases recognized that `all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner&#x27;s use of it shall not be injurious to the community.&#x27; &quot;Mugler v. Kansas&quot;, 123 U.S. 623, 665 (1887). The most straightforward example of this principle occurs when the government must condemn or destroy property to prevent spread of disease or other threat to the public health or safety. &quot;Thus, in order to protect the health and safety of the community, government may condemn unsafe structures, may close unlawful business operations, may destroy infected trees, and surely may restrict access to hazardous areas – for example, land on which radioactive materials have been discharged, land in the path of a lava flow from an erupting volcano, or land in the path of a potentially life-threatening flood. When a governmental entity imposes these types of health and safety regulations, it may not be &#x27;burdened with the condition that [it] must compensate such individual owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict injury upon the community.&#x27;&quot;

===Andrus v. Allard===

In &quot;Andrus v. Allard&quot;, 444 U.S. 51 (1979), the Court found that the federal Eagle Protection Act could prohibit the sale of lawfully purchased eagle parts. The Court noted that the Act did not confiscate the owner&#x27;s property, but rather regulated the terms of sale:

The regulations challenged here do not compel the surrender of the artifacts, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them. Rather, a significant restriction has been imposed on one means of disposing of the artifacts. But the denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses a full &quot;bundle&quot; of property rights, the destruction of one &quot;strand&quot; of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety. [citations omitted]. In this case, it is crucial that appellees retain the rights to possess and transport their property, and to donate or devise the protected birds. 

The fact that the statute barred the most profitable use of the property was not sufficient, the Court held:

It is, to be sure, undeniable that the regulations here prevent the most profitable use of appellees&#x27; property. Again, however, that is not dispositive. When we review regulation, a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking. Compare &quot;Goldblatt v. Hempstead&quot;, supra, at 594, and &quot;Hadacheck v. Sebastian&quot;, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), with &quot;Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon&quot;, supra. In the instant case, it is not clear that appellees will be unable to derive economic benefit from the artifacts; for example, they might exhibit the artifacts for an admissions charge. At any rate, loss of future profits – unaccompanied by any physical property restriction – provides a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim. Prediction of profitability is essentially a matter of reasoned speculation that courts are not especially competent to perform. Further, perhaps because of its very uncertainty, the interest in anticipated gains has traditionally been viewed as less compelling than other property-related interests. Cf., e. g., Fuller &amp; Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages (pt. 1), 46 Yale L. J. 52 (1936). 

===Agins===
One year after the eagle feather decision in Andrus, the Court decided &quot;Agins v. Tiburon&quot;, 447 U.S. 255 (1980). In Agins the Court stated that the application of land-use regulations to a particular piece of property is a taking when it denies the land&#x27;s owner reasonable, viable use of it, or &quot;if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests ... or denies an owner economically viable use of his land.&quot; After landowners had acquired of unimproved land in a city for residential development, the city was required by California law to prepare a general plan governing land use and the development of open-space land. In response, the city adopted zoning ordinances that placed the owners&#x27; property in a zone in which property may be devoted to one-family dwellings, accessory buildings, and open-space uses, with density restrictions permitting appellants to build between one and five single-family residences on their tract. The city expressed its intention to acquire the Agins parcel for open space, and actually commenced condemnation proceedings to take title to it. Later, the city abandoned the condemnation, and adopted the ordinance in issue. Without having sought approval for development of their tract under the ordinances, appellants brought suit against the city in state court, alleging that the city had taken their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The California Supreme Court departed from long-standing California precedent and held that monetary compensation was not available in regulatory taking cases which the court refused to recognize. That holding was eventually overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court a few years later in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987).

The U.S. Supreme Court held:

The application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188 (1928), or denies an owner economically viable use of his land, see Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 138, n. 36 (1978). The determination that governmental action constitutes a taking is, in essence, a determination that the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest. Although no precise rule determines when property has been taken, see Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979), the question necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests. In this case, the law confers a reciprocal benefit: it benefits all landowners, serving the city&#x27;s interest in assuring careful and orderly development of residential property with provision for open-space areas.

It took Bonnie Agins 30 years of litigation and administrative proceedings before she was permitted to build three houses on her parcel.

Note that the &quot;substantially advance&quot; element of Agins, was later overruled in the Lingle v. Chevron case, where the court explained that its Agins opinion was mistaken on that point and that the &quot;substantially advance&quot; element was appropriate in substantive due process cases, not taking ones.

===Loretto decision===
In &quot;Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.&quot;, 458 U.S. 419 (1982), the Supreme Court ruled that a regulation is generally considered a &quot;&quot; taking when it forces land owners to endure a permanent physical occupation on their land, such as the permanent physical presence of cable lines on a residential building. The Court held that any permanent physical presence destroyed the property owner&#x27;s right to exclude, long recognized as one of the key rights in the &quot;bundle of rights&quot; commonly characterized as property. The Court considered a New York statute which required landlords to install CATV cable facilities on the roof of their buildings; the facilities were part of a citywide cable network designed to bring cable services to the entire city. The landlords were required to provide a location for of cable one-half inch in diameter and two metal boxes at a one-time charge determined by the Cable Commission at $1. The City argued that the Court should apply a balancing test—that the invasion of property was minimal in comparison to the community wide benefit. But the Court&#x27;s decision suggested that there was a per se rule requiring compensation in cases of this kind. In short, when the &quot;character of the governmental action, is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.&quot;

The dissent in &quot;Loretto&quot; pointed out that there are circumstances wherein the government may require installation of devices without compensation: &quot;...the States traditionally – and constitutionally – have exercised their police power &quot;to require landlords to ... provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building.&quot; These provisions merely ensure tenants access to services the legislature deems important, such as water, electricity, natural light, telephones, inter-communication systems, and mail service. The majority opinion distinguished such requirements because they &quot;do not require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his building by a third party.&quot;

===Bayview Homes===
In 1985, the Supreme Court applied its regulatory takings analysis to the Clean Water Act, which prohibits any discharge of dredged or fill materials into &quot;navigable waters&quot;—defined as the &quot;waters of the United States&quot;—unless authorized by a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (&quot;Corps&quot;). &quot;United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.&quot;, 474 U.S. 121. The Corps issued regulations construing the Act to cover all &quot;freshwater wetlands&quot; that are adjacent to other covered waters. These regulations defined the adjacent wetlands as &quot;those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.&quot; Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., began placing fill materials on its property near the shores of Lake St. Clair, Michigan. A Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Corps&#x27; interpretation, and suggested that the regulation would create a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

In its decision, the Supreme Court held that in order to be within the regulatory authority of the United States, these semi-aquatic characteristics would have to be the result of frequent flooding by the nearby navigable waters. But the Supreme Court rejected the attempt to narrow the Corps of Engineer&#x27;s regulatory reach. Perhaps some particular properties might in individual cases be so adversely impacted that a taking might be found. But this would not justify overturning the regulation itself. &quot;Governmental land-use regulation may under extreme circumstances amount to a &#x27;taking&#x27; of the affected property. See, e.g., &quot;Williamson County Regional Planning Comm&#x27;n v. Hamilton Bank&quot;, 473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985); &quot;Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City&quot;, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). But mere assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute a regulatory taking. See &quot;Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association&quot;, 452 U.S. 264 (1981). A requirement that a person obtain a permit before engaging in a certain use of his or her property does not itself &quot;take&quot; the property in any sense: after all, the very existence of a permit system implies that permission may be granted, leaving the landowner free to use the property as desired. Moreover, even if the permit is denied, there may be other viable uses available to the owner. &quot;[e]quitable relief is not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private property for a public use, duly authorized by law, when a suit for compensation can be brought against the sovereign subsequent to a taking.&quot; &quot;Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.&quot;, 467 U.S. 986 (1984) This maxim rests on the principle that so long as compensation is available for those whose property is in fact taken, the governmental action is not unconstitutional.

=== Hodel v. Irving ===
Less than a decade after the Andrus decision, the Court found there to be a taking when the government took only a single strand of the bundle of property – the right to pass property to one&#x27;s heirs. On Indian reservations, property belonging to Native Americans was often fractionated, meaning that with each generation a parcel&#x27;s ownership could be divided up between more and more heirs, making it extremely difficult to put the property to economic use. To solve this problem, Congress passed the Indian Lands Consolidation Act, stopping interests in land constituting less than 2% of the total ownership from being further divided up through a will or by intestate succession (property that passes without a will upon the death of the owner). Instead such interests would become property of the tribes. In Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 (1987), the Supreme Court held that a &quot;complete abolition of both the descent and devise of a particular class of property may be a taking.&quot; It found that even though only a single strand of the property was affected, it was nevertheless an uncompensated taking that violated the Fifth Amendment. There was some disagreement among the concurring justices whether this decision affected Andrus, with Justices Rehnquist, Scalia and Powell finding it limited Andrus to its facts, while Justices Brennan, Marshall and Stevens opined that Andrus was unaffected. In 1997, the Court found a successor statute similarly unconstitutional as an uncompensated taking in Youpee v. Babbit, 519 U.S. 234 (1997).

===Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council===
In the &quot;Penn Central&quot; case, the Supreme Court had described a three-prong balancing test, which required a case-by-case analysis to determine if there had been a regulatory taking. This meant that it was difficult to predict whether a particular regulation merited compensation. Might there be situations in which there should be a &quot;per se&quot; rule requiring compensation? In &quot;Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a State regulation that deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use of that property can be a taking. Lucas had purchased two residential lots on a South Carolina barrier island, intending to build single-family homes such as those on the immediately adjacent parcels. At that time, Lucas&#x27;s lots were not subject to the State&#x27;s coastal zone building permit requirements. In 1988, however, the state legislature enacted the Beachfront Management Act, which barred Lucas from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his parcels. He filed suit against respondent state agency, contending that, even though the Act may have been a lawful exercise of the State&#x27;s police power, the ban on construction deprived him of all &quot;economically viable use&quot; of his property and therefore effected a &quot;taking&quot; under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments that required the payment of just compensation. The court further clarified, however, that a regulation is not a taking if it is consistent with &quot;restrictions that background principles of the State&#x27;s law of property and nuisance already placed upon ownership.&quot; As an example of &quot;background principles,&quot; the court referred to the right of government to prevent flooding of others&#x27; property. The Court noted:

A review of the relevant decisions demonstrates that the &quot;harmful or noxious use&quot; principle was merely this Court&#x27;s early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regulatory diminution in value; that the distinction between regulation that &quot;prevents harmful use&quot; and that which &quot;confers benefits&quot; is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis; and that, therefore, noxious-use logic cannot be the basis for departing from this Court&#x27;s categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. ... Although it seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on Lucas&#x27;s land, this state-law question must be dealt with on remand. To win its case, respondent cannot simply proffer the legislature&#x27;s declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, but must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses Lucas now intends in the property&#x27;s present circumstances.

&quot;Lucas&quot; was remanded to the South Carolina Supreme Court which in turn remanded it to the trial court for a valuation trial. However, the case settled when the state bought Lucas&#x27; property, and later resold it to a developer.

===Palazzolo===
On June 28, 2001, the Court issued its opinion in &quot;Palazzolo v. Rhode Island&quot;, 533 U.S. 606 (2001). Palazzolo addressed two issues: When is a takings claim ripe? When does notice of a preexisting regulation destroy the right to challenge the application of that regulation? For forty years, the plaintiff&#x27;s corporation owned a valuable parcel of property in the town of Westerly, Rhode Island. The property consisted of roughly eighteen acres of wetlands and a small indeterminate amount of uplands. The land was divided into seventy-four parcels in two subdivision map filings that occurred in 1936 and 1959. Like the neighboring homes, the only way to develop Mr. Palazzolo&#x27;s land is to raise the grade with fill.

In 1971, the Rhode Island Legislature authorized the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) to regulate the filling of coastal wetlands. The CRMC promulgated regulations requiring that any filling of coastal salt marsh, such as that found on the plaintiff&#x27;s property, meet certain public interest requirements. CRMC had ruled that private housing does not meet this public interest requirement. Prior to the adoption of this regulatory regime, the plaintiff applied twice to utilize the property but each time the State withdrew its approval, and the plaintiff did not appeal.

As a preliminary issue the Supreme Court addressed the question whether Palazzolo&#x27;s case was &quot;ripe&quot; for review by the Courts. The central question, the Court found, was whether the plaintiff had obtained a final decision from the Council determining the permitted use for the land. A number of previous cases had established &quot;the important principle that a landowner may not establish a taking before a land-use authority has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to decide and explain the reach of a challenged regulation:A final decision does not occur until the responsible agency determines the extent of permitted development on the land. MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340, 351. But the landowner

On the question of whether the plaintiff could proceed with a taking claim after he acquired the property in his personal capacity from his corporation after the regulations were already in place, the Court held that he could. As Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority said, Were the Court to accept that rule, the postenactment transfer of title would absolve the State of its obligation to defend any action restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable. A State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration date on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land.

== Exactions ==
Land-use exactions and permit conditions are governed by the &quot;Nollan-Dolan&quot; rule. In &quot;Nollan v. California Coastal Commission&quot;, the Supreme Court adopted a test to determine when an exaction is a taking: the municipality &quot;must demonstrate an &#x27;essential nexus&#x27; between a harm identified with the proposed development and the required exaction.&quot; In &quot;Dolan&quot;, the Court clarified that there had to be a rough proportionality between the exaction and the impact of the proposed development. It has been suggested by scholars that in exaction cases, the government gives the regulation heightened scrutiny akin to rational basis with bite.

===Nollan===
In &quot;Nollan v. California Coastal Commission&quot;, the Court reviewed a regulation under which the California Coastal Commission demanded a lateral public easement across the plaintiffs&#x27; beachfront lot in exchange for a permit to demolish an existing bungalow and replace it with a three-bedroom two-story house. The public easement was designed to connect two public beaches that were separated by property belonging to the plaintiffs and their neighbors. The Coastal Commission had asserted that the public easement condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishing the &quot;blockage of the view of the ocean&quot; caused by construction of the larger house. The Court observed that requiring a dedication of private property in exchange for a building permit was &quot;an out-and-out plan of extortion&quot; unless it could be shown that the private development imposed a burden on public facilities or resources, and the dedication would mitigate such impact. This became known as the &quot;essential nexus&quot; between a legitimate state interest and the permit condition.

=== Dolan ===
In &quot;Dolan v. City of Tigard&quot;, 512 U.S. 374 (1994) the Court evaluated further the degree of the connection required between permit conditions and impacts caused by a development. In that case, a business owner sought to expand a plumbing supply store on property adjacent to a floodplain and sought to pave more parking spaces for the store. The City of Tigard, Oregon, conditioned the building on the owner creating a public greenway and building a bike path on the land. The City justified the conditions as necessary to prevent flooding and traffic congestion. The Supreme Court ruled that the city&#x27;s requirement would be a taking if the City did not show that there was a reasonable relationship between the creation of the greenway and bike path and the impact of the development. Moreover, such an exaction had to be roughly proportional to the impact. &quot;Without question, had the city simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of land along Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioning the grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred,&quot; the Court held. &quot;Such public access would deprive petitioner of the right to exclude others, &quot;one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.&quot;

=== Koontz v. St. Johns Water Management District ===

The &quot;Nollan&quot; and &quot;Dolan&quot; cases had previously held that permit exactions had to have an essential nexus and be roughly proportional to impacts caused by the permitted development. Both cases involved the dedication of land – an easement in &quot;Nollan&quot; and a public easement and bicycle path in &quot;Dolan&quot;. Left unanswered was the question whether an exaction demand of money was subject to the nexus and proportionality tests. In &quot;Koontz v. St. Johns Water Management District&quot;, The plaintiff sought permission to build a 3.7 acre shopping center on 14.9 acres of property, much of which was wetlands. The Water District agreed to provide the permit so long as Koontz dedicate 11 acres and spend money fixing up the drainage on district property several miles away. Koontz sued, not over the dedication of the land but over the requirement that he spend money on district property. The Supreme Court of Florida held that the holdings of &quot;Nollan&quot; and &quot;Dolan&quot; did not apply because they involved exaction demands for land, as opposed to money. The Supreme Court reversed, finding that the cases were concerned about demands for property and that because money is a form of property, a monetary exaction is subject to those tests.

==Regulatory taking themes==

===Permit exhaustion===
One precondition of a regulatory takings claim is that the claimant must obtain a final decision by the regulating entity as to what uses will be permitted. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions make it clear that the mere assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute a regulatory taking. See &quot;Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association&quot;, 452 U.S. 264, 293–297(1981).

In &quot;Palazzolo&quot;, the Court held that the case was ripe because Palazzolo had applied for multiple permits and it was clear what could or could not be done with the property.

==== Takings &quot;per se&quot; ====
The Supreme Court has established a number of tests under which a state regulation constitutes a taking &quot;.&quot; These are physical invasion (as in &quot;Loretto Teleprompter&quot;), denial of all economically viable private property uses (as in &quot;Lucas&quot;), or requiring the owners to dedicate some of their property to the government without a justifying reason for so doing (as in &quot;Nollan, Dolan,&quot; and &quot;Koontz&quot;). For example, when the owners&#x27; proposed land use will result in a significant increase in traffic they may be required to dedicate a strip of their land to improve an adjacent road.

But when an action does not fall into a category addressed by one of these tests, the Court relies primarily on an ad hoc inquiry into the specifics of such individual case. This test was established in &quot;Penn Central v. City of New York,&quot; which described the most relevant factors to be the owners investment-backed expectations, the economic impact of the regulation, and the character of the government action. This approach has been the subject of much criticism because of its unpredictability.

====The denominator problem====
In &quot;Penn Central&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that takings law does not divide property into discrete segments. Thus, the property interest in question during a taking case is the whole parcel of land and not a discrete sliver of it. This gave rise to the question of what is the &quot;denominator&quot; of the ownership fraction; i.e., what is the larger ownership whose part is being subjected to confiscatory regulation, since the regulatory taking of a part of it (the &quot;numerator&quot;) is not compensable.

In &quot;Murr v. Wisconsin&quot;, 137 S. Ct. 1933 (2017), the Court held that denominator is best assessed through a multi-factor balancing test that includes such factors as &quot;the treatment of the land, in particular how it is bounded or divided, under state and local law,&quot; the &quot;physical characteristics of the landowner’s property,&quot; and &quot;the value of the property under the challenged regulation.&quot;

The policy underlying the whole parcel rule is that it is &quot;essential to an interpretation of the takings clause that leaves any room for public planning and regulation of land uses.&quot; 

== The role of public interest advocacy in regulatory takings cases ==
The development of regulatory takings jurisprudence is notable for the contribution made by public interest advocates from both the conservationist and property rights advocacy camps. Both the property rights advocacy organizations and many conservation-oriented organizations have submitted numerous amicus briefs in virtually all the major regulatory takings cases at the Supreme Court as well as in a number of appellate courts. While the property rights advocacy organizations generally argue for greater protections for property rights, and compensation when those rights are taken, the conservation-oriented entities argue that government owes no compensation when it regulates to promote public health, safety and conservation values.

One of the more prominent advocates on behalf of property rights has been the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented the landowners in &quot;Nollan v. California Coastal Commission&quot;, &quot;Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Authority&quot;, &quot;Palazzolo v. Rhode Island&quot;, &quot;Koontz v. St. Johns Water Management District&quot;, and &quot;Murr v. Wisconsin&quot;. Another non-profit, Oregonians in Action, represented Mrs. Dolan in her battle with the City of Tigard. Likewise, Mountain States Legal Foundation represented the landowner in &quot;Brandt v. United States&quot;, a case where a railroad-right-of-way had been taken by the federal government. 

On the other side of the debate, the State of Hawaii was represented by Vermont Law School Professor John Echeverria in &quot;Lingle v. Chevron&quot;, and who has worked with the Audubon Society and Community Rights Council.

<doc id="144078" wikidata="Q309602" url="?curid=144078" title="Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, 1st Baronet, KLS (5 April 1810 – 5 March 1895) was a British East India Company army officer, politician, and Orientalist, sometimes described as the Father of Assyriology. His son, also Henry, was to become a senior commander in the British Army during the First World War.

==Early life and army service==
Rawlinson was born on 5 April 1810 at the place now known as Chadlington, Oxfordshire, England. He was the second son of Abram Tyack Rawlinson and elder brother of the historian George Rawlinson. In 1827, having become proficient in the Farsi, he was sent to Persia in company with other British officers to drill and reorganize the Shah&#x27;s troops. Disagreements between the Persian court and the British government, also involving Russia, ended in the departure of the British officers.

Rawlinson began to study Persian inscriptions, more particularly those in the cuneiform character, which had been only partially deciphered by Grotefend and Saint-Martin. For two years from 1836, he was in Kermanshah in western Iran, near the great cuneiform inscription at Behistun, written in Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian (a later form of Akkadian) by Darius the Great between 522 and 486 BC. Standing on a shaky ladder, Rawlinson was the first Westerner to transcribe the Old Persian portion of the text. With his knowledge of Old Persian, he set about deciphering the Elamite and Babylonian sections.

==Political career==
Rawlinson was appointed political agent at Kandahar in 1840, serving for three years. In 1844, for his service to the British Empire in the course of the Afghan War, he was made Companion of the Order of the Bath.

A chance encounter with the governor-general resulted in his appointment as political agent in Ottoman Arabia. Settling in Baghdad, he devoted himself to cuneiform studies, and in 1847 he was able to send to Europe a full and accurate transcript of the Behistun inscription, which he was also successful in deciphering and interpreting. Having collected a large amount of antiquarian and geographical information in the pursuit of various explorations, including visits with Sir Austen Henry Layard to the ruins of Nineveh, he returned to England on leave of absence in 1849.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1850, praised as &quot;The Discoverer of the key to the Ancient Persian, Babylonian, and Assyrian Inscriptions in the Cuneiform character. The Author of various papers on the philology, antiquities, and Geography of Mesopotamia and Central Asia. Eminent as a Scholar&quot;.

Remaining at home for two years, in 1851 he published his memoir on the Behistun inscription and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. The British Museum took custody of his valuable collection of Babylonian, Sabaean and Sassanian antiquities, and made him a considerable grant to continue Layard&#x27;s Assyrian and Babylonian excavations. In 1851, he returned to Baghdad, where his archaeological finds contributed greatly to the final decipherment and interpretation of the cuneiform character. Rawlinson&#x27;s greatest contribution was the discovery that individual cuneiform signs had multiple readings depending on their context. Rawlinson worked with the younger George Smith at the British Museum.

An equestrian accident in 1855 hastened his determination to return to England, and in that year, he resigned his post in the East India Company. Prior to his return, Rawlinson was involved in the ill-fated French mission to ship over 200 cases of antiquities to Europe, which were mostly lost at Al-Qurnah.

On his return to England, he received the distinction of Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and he was appointed a crown director of the East India Company.

The remaining forty years of his life were full of activity (political, diplomatic and scientific) and were spent mainly in London. From February to September 1858, he sat as Member of Parliament for Reigate, and he was appointed a member of the first India Council. He left again in 1859, when he was sent to Persia as envoy plenipotentiary, but returned after a year owing to his dissatisfaction with the position. He was MP for Frome from 1865 to 1868, and again served on the Council of India from 1868 until his death.

== Attitudes concerning Russia ==
Rawlinson was one of the most important figures arguing that Britain must check Russian ambitions in South Asia. He was a strong advocate of the Forward Policy in Afghanistan and counselled the retention of Kandahar. He argued that Tsarist Russia would attack and absorb Kokand, Bukhara and Khiva (which occurred, and the regions are now parts of Uzbekistan) and warned that it would invade Persia (Iran) and Afghanistan as springboards to British India.

==Later life==
He was a trustee of the British Museum from 1876 to his death. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1889, and created a baronet in 1891; he was president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1874 to 1875 and of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1869 to 1871 and 1878 to 1881; and received honorary degrees at Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh.

He married Louisa Caroline Harcourt Seymour, daughter of Jane (née Hopkinson) and Henry Seymour, on 2 September 1862, with whom he had two sons: Henry and Alfred. He was widowed on 31 October 1889 and died in London of influenza five years later. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.

==Published works==

Rawlinson&#x27;s published works include four volumes of cuneiform inscriptions, published under his direction between 1870 and 1884 by the trustees of the British Museum; &quot;The Persian Cuneiform Inscription at Behistun&quot; (1846–1851) and &quot;Outline of the History of Assyria&quot; (1852), both reprinted from the Asiatic Society&#x27;s journals; &quot;A Commentary on the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Babylon and Assyria&quot; (1850); &quot;Notes on the Early History of Babylonia&quot; (1854); and &quot;England and Russia in the East&quot; (1875). He also made a variety of minor contributions to the publications of learned societies. He contributed articles on Baghdad, the Euphrates and Kurdistan to the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, together with several other articles dealing with the East; and he assisted in editing a translation of &quot;The Histories&quot; of Herodotus by his brother, Canon George Rawlinson.

<text>County Tipperary () is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Munster and the Southern Region. The county is named after the town of Tipperary, and was established in the early 13th century, shortly after the Norman invasion of Ireland. It is Ireland&#x27;s largest inland county and shares a border with eight counties, more than any other. The population of the county was 167,895 at the 2022 census. The largest towns are Clonmel, Nenagh and Thurles.

Tipperary County Council is the local authority for the county. In 1838, County Tipperary was divided into two ridings, North and South. From 1899 until 2014, they had their own county councils. They were unified under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, which came into effect following the 2014 local elections on 3 June 2014.

==Geography==
Tipperary is the sixth-largest of the 32 counties by area and the 12th largest by population. It is the third-largest of Munster&#x27;s six counties by both size and population. It is also the largest landlocked county in Ireland.

Tipperary is bounded (clockwise) by counties Offaly, Laois, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Clare and Galway. Its eight neighbours are the most of any county on the island.

The region is part of the central plain of Ireland, but the diverse terrain contains several mountain ranges: the Knockmealdown, the Galtee, the Arra Hills and the Silvermine Mountains. Most of the county is drained by the River Suir; the north-western part by tributaries of the River Shannon; the eastern part by the River Nore; the south-western corner by the Munster Blackwater. No part of the county touches the coast. The centre is known as &#x27;the Golden Vale&#x27;, a rich pastoral stretch of land in the Suir basin which extends into counties Limerick and Cork. At 917 m, Galtymore is the highest point.

The Devil&#x27;s Bit is a part of the Slieve Bloom range. The River Shannon flows along the northwest border with counties Limerick, Galway and Clare. The River Suir rises at the Devil&#x27;s Bit and flows into the sea east of Waterford.

===Baronies===
There are 12 historic baronies in County Tipperary: Clanwilliam, Eliogarty, Iffa and Offa East, Iffa and Offa West, Ikerrin, Kilnamanagh Lower, Kilnamanagh Upper, Middle Third, Ormond Lower, Ormond Upper, Owney and Arra and Slievardagh.

===Civil parishes and townlands===

Parishes were delineated after the Down Survey as an intermediate subdivision, with multiple townlands per parish and multiple parishes per barony. The civil parishes had some use in local taxation and were included on the nineteenth century maps of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. For poor law purposes, district electoral divisions replaced the civil parishes in the mid-nineteenth century. There are 199 civil parishes in the county. Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland; there are 3,159 townlands in the county.

===Largest towns===


==History==
Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Kingdom of Munster was claimed as a lordship. By 1210, the sheriffdom of Munster shired into the shires of Tipperary and Limerick. In 1328, Tipperary was granted to the Earls of Ormond as a county palatine or liberty. The grant excluded church lands such as the archiepiscopal see of Cashel, which formed the separate county of Cross Tipperary. Though the Earls gained jurisdiction over the church lands in 1662, &quot;Tipperary and Cross Tipperary&quot; were not definitively united until the County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715, when the 2nd Duke of Ormond was attainted for supporting the Jacobite rising of 1715.

The county was divided once again in 1838. The county town of Clonmel, where the grand jury held its twice-yearly assizes, is at the southern limit of the county, and roads leading north were poor, making the journey inconvenient for jurors resident there. A petition to move the county town to a more central location was opposed by the MP for Clonmel, so instead the county was split into two &quot;ridings&quot;; the grand jury of the South Riding continued to meet in Clonmel, while that of the North Riding met in Nenagh. When the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 established county councils to replace the grand jury for civil functions, the ridings became separate &quot;administrative counties&quot; with separate county councils. Their names were changed from &quot;Tipperary North/South Riding&quot; to &quot;North/South Tipperary&quot; by the Local Government Act 2001, which redesignated all &quot;administrative counties&quot; as simply &quot;counties&quot;. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 has amalgamated the two counties and restored a single county of Tipperary.

==Local government and politics==
Following the 2014 local election, Tipperary County Council is the local authority for the county. The authority is the successor council to North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council which operated up until June 2014. The local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing.

Most of the county is in the Dáil constituency of Tipperary, which returns five deputies (TDs) to the Dáil. A small part of the county in the former rural district of Nenagh is in the constituency of Limerick City. The county is part of the South constituency for European elections.

== Culture ==

Tipperary is referred to as the &quot;Premier County&quot;, a description attributed to Thomas Davis, Editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper in the 1840s as a tribute to the nationalistic feeling in Tipperary and said that &quot;where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows&quot;.
Tipperary was the subject of the famous song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; written by Jack Judge, whose grandparents came from the county. It was popular with regiments of the British Army during World War I.
The song &quot;Slievenamon&quot;, which is traditionally associated with the county, was written by Charles Kickham from Mullinahone, and is commonly sung at sporting fixtures involving the county.

== Irish language ==
There is no Gaeltacht in County Tipperary and consequently few Irish speakers. Nevertheless, there are five Gaelscoileanna (Irish language primary schools) and two Gaelcholáistí (Irish language secondary schools).

== Economy ==
The area around Clonmel is the economic hub of the county, due to manufacturing facilities owned by Bulmers (brewers) and Merck &amp; Co. (pharmaceuticals) east of the town. There is much fertile land, especially in the region known as the Golden Vale, one of the richest agricultural areas in Ireland.

Tipperary is famous for its horse breeding industry and is the home of Coolmore Stud, the largest thoroughbred breeding operation in the world.

Tourism plays a significant role in County Tipperary – Lough Derg, Thurles, Rock of Cashel, Ormonde Castle, Ahenny High Crosses, Cahir Castle, Bru Boru Heritage Centre and Tipperary Crystal are some of the primary tourist destinations in the county.

== Transport ==
Road transport dominates in County Tipperary. The M7 motorway crosses the north of the county through Roscrea and Nenagh and the M8 motorway bisects the county from north of Two-Mile Borris to the County Limerick border. Both routes are among some of the busiest roads on the island. The Limerick to Waterford N24 crosses the southern half of Tipperary, travelling through Tipperary Town, Bansha, north of Cahir and around Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.

===Railways===
Tipperary also has a number of railway stations situated on the Dublin–Cork line such as Templemore, Thurles and Limerick Junction. The Dublin-to-Limerick line connect at Ballybrophy for services through north Tipperary. The Limerick–Waterford line connect to the Dublin–Cork line at Limerick Junction. The railway lines connect places in Tipperary with Cork, Dublin Heuston, Waterford, Limerick, Mallow, and Galway.

== Sports ==
County Tipperary has a strong association with the Gaelic Athletic Association, which was founded in Thurles in 1884. Tipperary GAA – a county board of the GAA – organizes local competitions for hurling, Gaelic football, camogie and handball. The board also enters county representative teams into the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship and All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.

Tipperary is the only county across any Gaelic game to have won an all-Ireland title in every decade since the 1880s. Hurling has traditionally been the county&#x27;s dominant sport, however, with its hurling team having won 28 All-Ireland titles in comparison to the football team&#x27;s four. Tipperary has the third-highest All-Ireland tally of any county hurling team, behind only Kilkenny and Cork.

Horse racing takes place at Tipperary Racecourse, Thurles Racecourse and Clonmel Racecourse.

<text>George Rawlinson (23 November 1812 – 6 October 1902) was a British scholar, historian and Christian theologian.

==Life==
Rawlinson was born at Chadlington, Oxfordshire, the son of Abram Tysack Rawlinson and the younger brother of the famous Assyriologist, Sir Henry Rawlinson. His father was a breeder of racehorses, and bred the winner of the 1841 Derby. Rawlinson was educated at Ealing School. Having taken a First in Literae Humaniores at the University of Oxford (from Trinity College) in 1838, he was elected to a fellowship at Exeter College, in 1840, where he was a Fellow and tutor from 1842 to 1846. He was ordained in 1841, was curate at Merton, Oxfordshire, from 1846 to 1847, was Bampton Lecturer in 1859, and was Camden Professor of Ancient History from 1861 to 1889.

In his early days at Oxford, Rawlinson played cricket for the University, appearing in five matches between 1836 and 1839 which have since been considered to have been first-class.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869.

In 1872, he was appointed canon of Canterbury, and after 1888 he was rector of the rich City of London benefice All Hallows, Lombard Street. In 1873, he was appointed proctor in Convocation for the Chapter of Canterbury.

He married in 1846 Louisa Chermside, daughter of Sir Robert Alexander Chermside. The couple had 13 children. They celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1896.

Canon Rawlinson died at his residence in Cathedral precincts, Canterbury, on 6 October 1902.

==Publications==
His chief publications are his translation of the &quot;History&quot; of Herodotus (in collaboration with Sir Henry Rawlinson and Sir John Gardner Wilkinson), 1858–60; &quot;The Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World&quot;, 1862–67; &quot;The Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy&quot; (Parthian), 1873; &quot;The Seventh Great Oriental Monarchy&quot; (Sassanian), 1875; &quot;Manual of Ancient History&quot;, 1869; &quot;Historical Illustrations of the Old Testament&quot;, 1871; &quot;The Origin of Nations&quot;, 1877; &quot;History of Ancient Egypt&quot;, 1881; &quot;Egypt and Babylon&quot;, 1885; &quot;History of Phoenicia&quot;, 1889; &quot;Parthia&quot;, 1893; &quot;Memoir of Major-General Sir HC Rawlinson&quot;, 1898.

His lectures to an audience at Oxford University on the topic of the accuracy of the Bible in 1859 were published in later years as the apologetic work &quot;The Historical Evidences of the Truth of the Scripture Records Stated Anew&quot;.

He was also a contributor to the &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Commentary&quot;, the &quot;Pulpit Commentary&quot;, Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Bible&quot;, and various similar publications. He was the author of the article &quot;Herodotus&quot; in the 9th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.

In his 1881 book, a &quot;History of Ancient Egypt&quot;, George Rawlinson wrote that in form the Egyptian most resembled the modern Arab. They were amongst the darkest of races that the Greeks came into contact with, but considered Herodotus to have made extreme exaggerations. Based on his viewing of monuments, he asserted the real complexion of the ordinary Egyptian man was brown-with a tinge of red, which he observed was not very different from the Copts. In another publication entitled &quot;Ancient Egypt&quot; released in 1887, Rawlinson would state the Egyptian people were of a &quot;mixed-race&quot;, derived by movements of Ethiopians from the south, Libyans from the west, and Semitic peoples coming from the north-east of the continent.

<doc id="144089" wikidata="Q166332" url="?curid=144089" title="Eminent domain">
<text>Eminent domain, also known as land acquisition, compulsory purchase, resumption, resumption/compulsory acquisition, or expropriation, is the compulsory acquisition of private property for public use. It does not include the power to take and transfer ownership of private property from one property owner to another private property owner without a valid public purpose. This power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized to exercise the functions of public character.

The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and public utilities. Many railroads were given the right of eminent domain to obtain land or easements in order to build and connect rail networks. In the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party for redevelopment. This was initially done only to a property that had been deemed &quot;blighted&quot; or a &quot;development impediment&quot;, on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.

Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in fee simple, and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.

Takings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).

==Meaning==
The term &quot;eminent domain&quot; was taken from the legal treatise &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; (&quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot;), written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625, which used the term (Latin for &quot;supreme ownership&quot;) and described the power as follows:
The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But, when this is done, the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.

The exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Condemnors may also take personal property, even intangible property such as contract rights, patents, trade secrets, and copyrights. Even the taking of a professional sports team&#x27;s franchise has been held by the California Supreme Court to be within the purview of the &quot;public use&quot; constitutional limitation, although eventually, that taking (of the Oakland Raiders&#x27; NFL franchise) was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

A taking of property must be accompanied by payment of &quot;just compensation&quot; to the [former] owner. In theory, this is supposed to put the owner in the same position that he would have been in had his property not been taken. But in practice courts have limited compensation to the property&#x27;s fair market value, considering its highest and best use. But though rarely granted, this is not the exclusive measure of compensation; see &quot;Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States&quot; (business losses in temporary takings) and &quot;United States v. Pewee Coal Co.&quot; (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine seized during World War II). In most takings owners are not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that, though incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the courts to be noncompensable in eminent domain. The same is true of attorneys&#x27; and appraisers fees. But as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have been made compensable by state legislative enactments, and in the U.S. may be partially covered by provisions of the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act.

==Africa==
===Zimbabwe===
Since the 1990s, the Zimbabwean government under Robert Mugabe has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the land reform movement in Zimbabwe. The government argued that such land reform was necessary to redistribute the land to Zimbabweans dispossessed of their lands during colonialism. These farmers were never compensated for this seizure.

==Asia==

=== China ===
In China, &quot;requisitions&quot;, the Chinese form of eminent domain, are constitutionally permitted as necessary for the public interest, and if compensation is provided. The 2019 Amendment of the Land Administration Law of China spells out rather detailed guidelines, guaranteeing farmers and those displaced greater financial security.

=== India ===

The Constitution of India originally provided for the Fundamental Right to property under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to &quot;acquire, hold and dispose of property&quot;. Article 31 provided that &quot;No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.&quot; It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been &quot;taken possession of or acquired&quot; for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the &quot;acquisition or requisition of property&quot; (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III). It is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source of the state&#x27;s &quot;eminent domain&quot; powers.

The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights. A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution to provide, &quot;No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.&quot; Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.

Land acquisition in India is currently governed by the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, which came into force on 1 January 2014. Until 2013, land acquisition in India was governed by Land Acquisition Act of 1894. However the new LARR (amendment) ordinance 31 December 2014 diluted many clauses of the original act.
The liberalisation of the economy and the Government&#x27;s initiative to set up special economic zones have led to many protests by farmers and have opened up a debate on the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property.

==Europe==
In many European nations, the European Convention on Human Rights provides protection from an appropriation of private property by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that &quot;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence&quot; and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention, which states that &quot;Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.&quot; Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public interest, is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of taxes. Settled case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.

===France===
In France, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen similarly mandates just and preliminary compensation before expropriation; and a is commonly required, to demonstrate a public benefit.

Notably, in 1945, by decree of General Charles de Gaulle based on untried accusations of collaboration with the Nazi occupier, the Renault company was expropriated from Louis Renault posthumously and nationalised as , without compensation.

===Germany===
The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany states in its Article 14 (3) that &quot;an expropriation is only allowed for the public good&quot; and just compensation must be made. It also provides for the right to have the amount of the compensation checked by a court.

===Italy===

 – or more formally (&quot;expropriation for public utility&quot;) – in Italy takes place within the frame of civil law, as an expression of the ( power). The law regulating expropriation is the D.P.R. n.327 of 2001, amended by D.Lgs. n.302 of 2002; it supersedes the old expropriation law, the Royal Decree n.2359 of 1865. Also other national and regional laws may apply, not always giving full compensation to the owner. Expropriation can be total (the whole property is expropriated) or partial; permanent or temporary.

The article 42 of the Italian Constitution and the article 834 of the Italian Civil Code state that any private goods can be expropriated for public utility. Furthermore, the article 2 of the Constitution binds Italian citizens to respect their &quot;mandatory duties of political, economic and social solidarity&quot;.

The implementation of the eminent domain follows two principles:
* legality: a public institution can expropriate private goods only in the cases law allows it and respecting its procedures (following article 23 of the Italian Constitution);
* compensation: (art. 42/III) the State must provide a certain amount of money as compensation, which is determined by law. According to the Italian Constitutional Court, this compensation is not required to be equal to the market value of the expropriated good, although this sum must not be merely symbolic.
 (&quot;nationalization&quot;), instead, is provided for by article 43 of the Constitution; it transfers to governmental authority and property a whole industrial sector, if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto monopoly, and an essential service of public utility. The most famous nationalization in Italy was the 1962 nationalization of the electrical power sector.

===Spain===
Article 33.3 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 allows forced expropriation () only where justified on the grounds of public utility or social interest and subject to the payment of appropriate compensation as provided for in law.

===Sweden===
The right of the state or a municipality to buy property when it is determined to be of &quot;particular public interest&quot; is regulated in (1972:719). The government purchases the property at an estimated market value plus a 25% compensation. The law also states that the property owner shall not suffer economic harm because of the expropriation.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====

After his victory in 1066, William the Conqueror seized virtually all land in England. Although he maintained absolute power over the land, he granted fiefs to landholders who served as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War in the 14th century, Edward III used the Crown&#x27;s right of purveyance for massive expropriations. Chapter 28 of Magna Carta required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As the king&#x27;s power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in Lincolnshire the power to take land without compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary takings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation. The common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus was eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in the United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried by juries well into the 20th century, such as &quot;Attorney-General v De Keyser&#x27;s Royal Hotel Ltd&quot; (1919).

In England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law, the related term compulsory purchase is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, the value of the taken land is determined by the Upper Tribunal. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal acts are the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 18), the Land Compensation Act 1961, the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, the Land Compensation Act 1973, the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, and the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.

==== Scotland ====

In Scotland, eminent domain is known as compulsory purchase. The development of powers of compulsory purchase originated in the railway mania of the Victorian period. Compensation is available to the landowner, with the Lands Tribunal for Scotland dealing with any disputes arising from the value of compensation. As in England and Wales, the law of compulsory purchase in Scotland is complex. The current statutes regulating compulsory purchase include: the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 19); the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947; and the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1963. The Scottish Law Commission considered the current state of the law of compulsory purchase and advocated reforms in its &quot;Discussion Paper on Compulsory Purchase&quot;. Such reforms have yet to be made by the Scottish Parliament.

== Oceania ==

===Australia===
In Australia, section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution permits the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to &quot;the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.&quot; This has been construed as meaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary recompense, rather it is for the court to determine what is just. It may be necessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice, lest the law be invalidated.

Property subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority from the Federal Court has extended the states&#x27; power to resume property to any form of physical property. For the purposes of section 51(xxxi), money is not property that may be compulsorily acquired.

The Commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired, that is, the Commonwealth can &quot;only legislate for the acquisition of Property for particular purposes&quot;. Accordingly, the power does not extend to allow legislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner&#x27;s title. The states and territories&#x27; powers of resumption on the other hand are not so limited. The section 43(1) of the Lands Acquisition Act 1998 (NT) grants the Minister the power to acquire land &#x27;for any purpose whatever&#x27;. The High Court of Australia interpreted this provision literally, relieving the Territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power. This finding permitted the Territory government to acquire land subject to Native Title, effectively extinguishing the Native Title interest in the land. Kirby J in dissent, along with a number of commentators, viewed this as a missed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of resumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation.

The term &quot;resumption&quot; is a reflection of the fact that, as a matter of Australian law, all land was originally owned by the Crown before it was sold, leased or granted and that, through the act of compulsory acquisition, the Crown is &quot;resuming&quot; possession.

=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, the Public Works Act 1981 outlines the powers of the state in relation to land used for public purposes. Under Section 16 of the Public Works Act 1981 the Minister is &quot;empowered to acquire under this Act any land required for a Government work&quot;. Local government authorities (such as City or District councils) are also empowered under the same section to acquire land for &quot;local work for which it has financial responsibility.&quot;

== North America ==

===The Bahamas===
In the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition of land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The land can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the Act). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may purchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To do so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with costs and charges plus 6 months’ additional interest.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes. Under these statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to &quot;be made whole&quot; by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.

===Panama===
In Panama, the government must pay a fair amount of money to the owner of the property to be expropriated.

=== United States ===
Most states use the term &quot;eminent domain&quot;, but some U.S. states use the term &quot;appropriation&quot; or &quot;expropriation&quot; (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers. The term &quot;condemnation&quot; is used to describe the formal act of exercising the power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property.

The constitutionally required &quot;just compensation&quot; in partial takings is usually measured by fair market value of the part taken, plus severance damages (the diminution in value of the property retained by the owner [remainder] when only a part of the subject property is taken). Where a partial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder, those must be deducted, typically from severance damages. Some elements of value, such as a business&#x27;s connection to the location and the goodwill of the public, are only compensable in a few jurisdictions; where they are not, fair market value may be less than the value of the location to the current user.

The practice of condemnation came to the American colonies with the common law. When it came time to draft the United States Constitution, differing views on eminent domain were voiced. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution requires that the taking be for a &quot;public use&quot; and mandates payment of &quot;just compensation&quot; to the owner.

In federal law, Congress can take private property directly (without recourse to the courts) by passing an Act transferring title of the subject property directly to the government. In such cases, the property owner seeking compensation must sue the United States for compensation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of &quot;public use&quot;.

==South America==

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina expropriations are governed by federal law 21.499 of January 17, 1977. It has been used in many locations throughout the country&#x27;s history most recently during the renationalization of YPF. which resulted in the expropriation of 51% of the energy company&#x27;s shares.

===Brazil===
Brazil&#x27;s expropriation laws are governed by the Presidential Decree No. 3365 of June 21, 1941.

===Chile===
Art. 19, No. 24, of the Chilean Constitution says in part, &quot;In no case may anyone be deprived of his property, of the assets affected or any of the essential faculties or powers of ownership, except by virtue of a general or a special law which authorizes expropriation for the public benefit or the national interest, duly qualified by the legislator. The expropriated party may protest the legality of the expropriation action before the ordinary courts of justice and shall, at all times, have the right to indemnification for patrimonial harm actually caused, to be fixed by mutual agreement or by a sentence pronounced by said courts in accordance with the law.&quot;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
Since 1967, the encyclical &quot;Populorum progressio&quot;, an encyclical on Catholic social teaching by Pope Paul VI, allows the expropriation of land estates for common good needs.

<text>Tyne and Wear () is a ceremonial county in North East England. It borders Northumberland to the north and County Durham to the south, and the largest settlement is the city of Newcastle upon Tyne.

The county is largely urbanised, with a population of 1.14 million in 2021. After Newcastle, the largest settlements are the city of Sunderland, Gateshead, and South Shields. Nearly all of the county&#x27;s settlements belong to the Tyneside or Wearside conurbations, the latter of which extends into County Durham. For local government purposes Tyne and Wear comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside. The borough councils collaborate through the North East Combined Authority, which also includes Durham County Council and Northumberland County Council. The county was created in 1974 from south-east Northumberland and north-east County Durham.

The most notable geographic features of the county are the River Tyne and River Wear, after which it is named and along which its major settlements developed. The county is also notable for its coastline to the North Sea in the east, which is characterised by tall limestone cliffs and wide beaches.

== History ==
In the late 600s and into the 700s St. Bede lived as a monk at the monastery of St. Peter and of St. Paul writing histories of the Early Middle Ages including the Ecclesiastical History of the English People.

Roughly 150 years ago, in the village of Marsden in South Shields, Souter Lighthouse was built, the first electric structure of this type.

The Local Government Act 1888 constituted Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and Sunderland as county boroughs (Newcastle had &quot;county corporate&quot; status as the &quot;County and Town of Newcastle upon Tyne&quot; since 1400). Tynemouth joined them in 1904. Between the county boroughs, various other settlements also formed part of the administrative counties of Durham and of Northumberland.

The need to reform local government on Tyneside was recognised by the government as early as 1935, when a &quot;Royal Commission to Investigate the Conditions of Local Government on Tyneside&quot; was appointed. The three commissioners were to:
examine the system of local government in the areas of local government north and south of the river Tyne from the sea to the boundary of the Rural District of Castle Ward and Hexham in the County of Northumberland and to the Western boundary of the County of Durham, to consider what changes, if any, should be made in the existing arrangements with a view to securing greater economy and efficiency, and to make recommendations.

The report of the Royal Commission, published in 1937, recommended the establishment of a Regional Council for Northumberland and Tyneside (to be called the &quot;Northumberland Regional Council&quot;) to administer services that needed to be exercised over a wide area, with a second tier of smaller units for other local-government purposes. The second-tier units would form by amalgamating the various existing boroughs and districts. The county boroughs in the area would lose their status. Within this area, a single municipality would be formed covering the four county boroughs of Newcastle, Gateshead, Tynemouth, South Shields and other urban districts and boroughs.

A minority report proposed amalgamation of Newcastle, Gateshead, Wallsend, Jarrow, Felling, Gosforth, Hebburn and Newburn into a single &quot;county borough of Newcastle-on-Tyneside&quot;. The 1937 proposals never came into operation: local authorities could not agree on a scheme and the legislation of the time did not allow central government to compel one.

Tyneside (excluding Sunderland) was a special review area under the Local Government Act 1958. The Local Government Commission for England came back with a recommendation to create a new county of Tyneside based on the review area, divided into four separate boroughs. This was not implemented. The Redcliffe-Maud Report proposed a Tyneside unitary authority, again excluding Sunderland, which would have set up a separate East Durham unitary authority.

The white paper that led to the Local Government Act 1972 proposed as &quot;area 2&quot; a metropolitan county including Newcastle and Sunderland, extending as far south down the coast as Seaham and Easington, and bordering &quot;area 4&quot; (which would become Tees Valley). The Bill as presented in November 1971 pruned back the southern edge of the area, and gave it the name &quot;Tyneside&quot;. The name &quot;Tyneside&quot; proved controversial on Wearside, and a government amendment changed the name to &quot;Tyne and Wear&quot; at the request of Sunderland County Borough Council.

== Geography ==
===Climate===
Tyne and Wear either has or closely borders two official Met Office stations, neither located in one of the major urban centres. The locations for those are in Tynemouth, where the river Tyne meets the North Sea, east of Newcastle; and inland at Durham, around south-west of Sunderland. There are some clear differences between the two stations&#x27; temperature and precipitation patterns, even though both have a cool-summer and mild-winter oceanic climate.

=== Green belt ===
Tyne and Wear contains green belt interspersed throughout the county, mainly on the fringes of the Tyneside/Wearside conurbation. There is also an inter-urban line of belt helping to keep the districts of South Tyneside, Gateshead, and Sunderland separated. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. All the county&#x27;s districts contain some portion of belt.

== Governance ==
Although Tyne and Wear County Council was abolished in 1986, several &quot;joint bodies&quot; exist to run certain services on a county-wide basis. Most notable is the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority, which co-ordinates transport policy. Through its passenger transport executive, known as Nexus, it owns and operates the Tyne and Wear Metro light rail system, the Shields Ferry service and the Tyne Tunnel, linking communities on either side of the River Tyne. Also through Nexus, the authority subsidises socially necessary transport services (including taxis) and operates a concessionary fares scheme for the elderly and disabled. Nexus has been an executive body of the North East Joint Transport Committee since November 2018.

Other joint bodies include the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums, which was created from the merger of the Tyne and Wear Archives Service and Tyne and Wear Museums. These joint bodies are administered by representatives of all five of the constituent councils. In addition the Northumbria Police force covers Northumberland and Tyne and Wear.

There have been occasional calls for Tyne and Wear to be abolished and the traditional border between Northumberland and County Durham to be restored.

Tyne and Wear is divided into 12 parliamentary constituencies. Historically, the area has been a Labour stronghold; South Shields is the only Parliamentary constituency that has never returned a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons since the Reform Act of 1832.

At the level of local government, all of the region&#x27;s five unitary authorities were controlled by Labour in 2019.

Newcastle and Sunderland are known for declaring their election results early on election night. Therefore, they frequently give the first indication of nationwide trends. An example of this was at the 2016 European Union referendum. Newcastle was the first large city to declare, and 50.6% of voters voted to Remain; this proportion was far lower than predicted by experts. Sunderland declared soon after and gave a 62% vote to Leave, much higher than expected. These two results were seen as an early sign that the United Kingdom had voted to Leave.

<doc id="144093" wikidata="Q470299" url="?curid=144093" title="Amesbury">
<text>Amesbury () is a town and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. It is known for the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge which is within the parish. The town is claimed to be the oldest occupied settlement in Great Britain, having been first settled around 8820 BC. The parish includes the hamlets of Ratfyn and West Amesbury, and part of Boscombe Down military airfield.

==Etymology==
The derivation of the name of the town is uncertain. It may derive from an Anglo-Saxon named &quot;Ambre&quot;, or from the Old English &quot;amore-burh&quot; meaning &#x27;fortification frequented by buntings or/and yellowhammers&#x27;. It has also been suggested that the name is derived from Ambrosius Aurelianus, leader of Romano-British resistance to Saxon invasions in the 5th century.

==Geography==
Amesbury is located in southern Wiltshire, north-northeast of Salisbury on the A345. It sits in the River Avon valley on the southern fringes of Salisbury Plain and has historically been considered an important river crossing area on the road from London to Warminster and Exeter. This has continued into the present with the building of the A303 across the Avon next to the town. Originally the town developed around the water meadows next to several bends in the river, but in time has spread onto the valley hillsides and absorbed part of the military airfield at Boscombe Down.

===Climate===
==History==
===Ancient and medieval===

The land around Amesbury has been settled since prehistoric times, evidenced by the monument of Stonehenge. In 2014, archaeologists from the University of Buckingham found Amesbury had been continually occupied since 8,820BC, causing &quot;The Guardian&quot; to write that Amesbury was &quot;in effect where British history began&quot;.

Other finds in the parish point to large-scale prehistoric structures and settlements in the area, including Bluestonehenge at West Amesbury, the numerous other monuments around Stonehenge, and the discovery of a Neolithic village in the neighbouring parish of Durrington by the Stonehenge Riverside Project. Excavations in 2002 and 2003 at Boscombe Down by Wessex Archaeology found the Amesbury Archer and Boscombe Bowmen.

During the Iron Age, a large hill fort now known as Vespasian&#x27;s Camp was built alongside the Stonehenge Avenue and overlooking the River Avon. The fort could have catered for up to 1,000 people, and was probably surrounded by smaller settlements and farming communities.

Roman remains are poorly documented at Amesbury, but excavations have revealed Roman structures in the Stonehenge landscape, and Wessex Archaeology found a large Roman graveyard in the area of the Amesbury Archer burial. It is likely that there was a large Romano-British settlement overlooking the River Avon at this point.

It is possible that an order of monks established a monastery in the area, that was destroyed by the Saxons before they settled the area in the 7th century. 

King Alfred the Great left Amesbury in his will, a copy of which is in the British Library, to his youngest son Aethelweard (–922). In 1086, Domesday Book recorded a settlement named &quot;Amblesberie&quot; or &quot;Ambresberie&quot; with 111 households and eight mills. The largest estate was held by Wilton Abbey, and other land was held by Edward of Salisbury.

In 979 AD, a Benedictine abbey, the Abbey of St Mary and St Melor, was founded on what may have been the site of a previous monastery, by Dowager Queen Ælfthryth. In 1177 the abbey was dissolved by Henry II and replaced with Amesbury Priory, with nuns and monks of the Fontevraud order. Henry III visited the priory several times, and his widow Eleanor of Provence retired there in 1286, leading to visits by her son, Edward I; his daughter Mary of Woodstock and niece Eleanor of Brittany had already entered the convent when young. The priory continued until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, after which its buildings – including the church with its lead-covered spire – were demolished.

Amesbury is also associated with the Arthurian legend: the convent to which Guinevere retired was said to have been the one at Amesbury. This legend has its origins in the world of Middle English Arthurian romance: the &quot;Stanzaic Morte Arthur&quot; (c. 1350–1400) is the earliest text to claim that Guinevere retired to Amesbury, rather than to Caerleon, as had previously been claimed by the historian Geoffrey of Monmouth. The claim was repeated in Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le_Morte_d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In 1542, the antiquarian John Leland took things further, stating that Guinevere had actually been buried at Amesbury before being disinterred and translated to Glastonbury Abbey to lie beside her husband, King Arthur. The tradition of Guinevere&#x27;s Amesbury burial came to a head in the early 1600s, when an ancient noblewoman&#x27;s grave was discovered during renovation work at the old Abbey site, then in the hands of the Earls of Hertford. Inigo Jones, the lead architect, was convinced that the grave was Guinevere&#x27;s, and in the decades after the discovery visitors flocked to Amesbury to see the grave for themselves, where a plaque had apparently been erected to mark the location.

===Modern history===
On John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the town&#x27;s name is spelt both &quot;Amesbury&quot; (for the hundred) and &quot;Ambersbury&quot; (for the town itself).

After the Dissolution, Amesbury became a secular estate and was given to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford by the Crown; the Seymour family held the estate until 1675. A new mansion which took the name Amesbury Abbey was completed in 1661, designed for William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset (d. 1660) by John Webb in neo-classical style.

The estate subsequently passed to the Bruce family, and then to Lord Carleton, who bequeathed it to his nephew Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry. The grounds feature a Chinese summerhouse commissioned by the Duke from Sir William Chambers. The estate remained in the Queensberry family until 1824. It is believed that at some point in the early 19th century, William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry planted the Nile Clumps to commemorate Admiral Nelson, and had the hillfort landscaped as part of the grounds around the mansion.

In 1824 Sir Edmund Antrobus acquired the estate and, finding the mansion in poor repair, had it rebuilt in 1834–1840 to designs of Thomas Hopper. In 1915 Lord Antrobus sold the grounds – including Stonehenge – to private bidders, although the mansion remained in Antrobus family hands until 1979. The house is now operated as a nursing home.

In 1677, John Rose, gentleman, founded two schools at Amesbury, a grammar school for teaching grammar, writing, and ciphering to twenty children born in the parish, and an &quot;English school&quot; to prepare twenty children of poor parents for the grammar school. By a decree in Chancery of 1831, the freedom of the grammar school was extended to children of &quot;mechanics, artisans, and small tradesmen&quot;. The grammar school was closed in 1899, and the children were transferred to a National School.

===Recent history===
With the establishment of the military Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down in 1939, Amesbury began to expand. As it lies within the A303 commuter belt, Amesbury has seen substantial developments on the land between the old town centre and Boscombe Down. Several new housing estates have been completed, and the most recent one – Archers Gate – has taken its name from the discovery of the Amesbury Archer. At the Boscombe Down junction of the A303, a mixed business development known as Solstice Park has been built.

On 30 June 2018, two British nationals were poisoned using Novichok nerve agents before being found unconscious at a property in Amesbury; one of them, Dawn Sturgess, later died. Almost four months earlier, the same nerve agents were used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in nearby Salisbury. In 2020 it was reported that the Amesbury property would be demolished.

==Population==
At the 2011 Census the population of the civil parish was 10,724. For the Amesbury Community Area the mid-2011 population was estimated to be 33,660 (this is a wide area stretching to Tilshead, Larkhill and Figheldean in the north; Cholderton in the east; the Winterbournes, the Woodfords and Great Wishford in the south; and Wylye in the west).

==Governance==
The civil parish elects a town council. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. For Westminster elections, it is part of the East Wiltshire constituency.

==Transport==
Amesbury is from the nearest station at Grateley on the London to Salisbury line. The town&#x27;s own station, Amesbury railway station, was closed in 1963 along with the rest of the Bulford Camp Railway.

Amesbury Bus Station closed in January 2014 along with the bus station in nearby Salisbury as a cost-cutting measure, but Salisbury Reds services still stop in the town. Stagecoach and Salisbury Reds jointly operate a frequent Salisbury-Amesbury-Tidworth-Andover service, and National Express provide a service to London. Salisbury Reds also operate the X4 Salisbury-Amesbury-Larkhill and the X5 Salisbury-Amesbury-Swindon.

==Local media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country from the Mendip TV transmitter. BBC South and ITV Meridian, can also be received from either the Hannington or Rowridge TV transmitters. The town&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire, Greatest Hits Radio Salisbury and British Forces Broadcasting Service that provides radio programmes for His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces in nearby Salisbury Plain. The local newspapers that cover the town is the Salisbury Journal and Avon Advertiser.

==Religious sites==
The church of St Mary and St Melor, the town&#x27;s parish church, is Grade I listed. Its nave is from the early 12th century and much of the rest is 13th-century. The large size of the building may reflect Amesbury&#x27;s early royal connections, or a link to Amesbury Abbey; it is thought that the abbey had its own church until its dissolution in the 16th century, but no evidence of that church survives above ground.

Amesbury Methodist Church was built in 1900, replacing an 1816 chapel. Christ the King Catholic church opened in 1985, replacing a 1933 building on a different site. Amesbury Baptist Church was built in 1997.

==Notable buildings==
The mansion known as Amesbury Abbey, standing in parkland close to the site of the former abbey, is Grade I listed. It was built in 1834–1840 by architect Thomas Hopper for Sir Edmund Antrobus, and replaced a similar house built in 1661 by John Webb for the 2nd Duke of Somerset. Features in the grounds include an ornamental bridge rebuilt in 1755. The house is now operated as a nursing home. Diana&#x27;s House and Kent House are flint and stone gatehouses to the property from the early 17th century; both are Grade II* listed and are irregular in plan with a high stair-tower, leading Pevsner to call them &quot;curious&quot;.
The Red House on Salisbury Road is a five-bay former farmhouse, rebuilt in red brick c.1700 and described by Pevsner as &quot;the best older house ... with a pretty early-19th-century cast-iron porch&quot;. This is the former home of Francis Stephen Long, Esquire, whose wife, Ann, remained at the Red House until her death in 1856. Nearby on Salisbury Road, Antrobus House was built in 1924–5 under a bequest of Lady Florence Antrobus (1856–1923) as a memorial to her son Edmund, who died at war in Belgium in 1914. Although intended as a village hall, Historic England state it is &quot;built to a high standard&quot;. In handmade brick, the tall five-bay central block contains the hall and has substantial wings on both sides. The low roadside wall in flint and stone has an overall length of 43m and a central iron gate set back from the road; the tall brick gate piers have stone vases.

West Amesbury House is from the 15th century and is Grade I listed; in flint and stone chequer, it was remodelled in the early 20th century by Detmar Blow.

==Education==
Amesbury has a secondary school – The Stonehenge School – and four primary schools:
* Amesbury Archer Primary School
* Amesbury Church of England Voluntary Controlled Primary School
* Christ The King Catholic Primary School
* King&#x27;s Gate Primary School

==Amenities==
The town centre has a hotel and restaurant, the Antrobus Arms (18th century and early 19th), and four pubs: The George Hotel (originally with later alterations), The Kings Arms (mid 18th century), The New Inn (early 19th) and The Bell (1908).

Antrobus House is a venue for community organisations, weddings and other events.

Amesbury has a Non-League football club, Amesbury Town F.C., which plays at Bonnymead Park. Amesbury Bowls Club have their green and clubhouse at Antrobus House.

==In popular culture==
Although Stonehenge falls within the parish of Amesbury, the town does not directly benefit from the monument&#x27;s fame. However, Amesbury has appeared in the public eye on its own merits in the past.

In 2002, the discovery of the richest Bronze Age burial site yet found in Britain was made at Amesbury. The remains of two men of apparently aristocratic rank were accompanied by over 100 objects including arrowheads, copper knives and the earliest worked gold in the country. The occupant of the more richly furnished grave has become known as the &quot;Amesbury Archer&quot;.

The town is linked to the Arthurian legend as it is popularly believed that Guinevere retired to the original convent at Amesbury after leaving Arthur. Legend holds that she is buried in the grounds of the former Abbey.

From 3–5 May 1965, The Beatles stayed at The Antrobus Hotel during the filming of &quot;Help!&quot; on Salisbury Plain. The Antrobus Hotel and the former Plaza Cinema were both used as locations for the filming of a BBC &quot;Miss Marple&quot; mystery.

&quot;The Salisbury Poisonings&quot;, a three-part dramatisation of the 2018 poisonings in Salisbury and Amesbury, was broadcast on BBC One in June 2020.

<doc id="144108" wikidata="Q588853" url="?curid=144108" title="Stuart Hamm">
<text>Stuart Hamm (born February 8, 1960) is an American bass guitar player, known for his session and live work with numerous artists as well as for his unconventional playing style and solo recordings.

==Career==
Born in New Orleans, Hamm spent his childhood and youth in Champaign, Illinois, where he studied bass and piano, played in the stage band at Champaign Central High School, and was selected to the Illinois All-State Band. Hamm graduated from Hanover High in Hanover, New Hampshire in 1978, while living in Norwich, Vermont. Following high school, he attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he met guitarist Steve Vai and, through him, met Joe Satriani. Hamm played bass on Vai&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Flex-Able&quot;, which was released in 1984.

Hamm has performed and recorded with Steve Vai, Frank Gambale, Joe Satriani and many other well-respected guitarists. It was his playing live on tour with Satriani that brought Hamm&#x27;s skills to national attention. Subsequent recordings with Satriani and other rock/fusion artists, along with the release of his own solo recordings, solidified his reputation as a bassist and performer.

==Style==
Hamm&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;, inspired by the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name, was released in 1988. On it, Hamm demonstrated his abilities on a number of original compositions spanning a variety of genres including fusion, country, and classical. On solo pieces like &quot;Country Music (A Night in Hell),&quot; he demonstrates his slapping and two-handed tapping proficiency as well as the ability to make the bass imitate the sounds of a wide range of instruments; the piece has since become a popular live piece. On the same album, he performs an arrangement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;.

Early in his career, Hamm was associated with Philip Kubicki&#x27;s Factor basses. Later, Fender musical instruments produced two signature model electric basses designed and endorsed by Hamm himself, the first artist model bass ever made by Fender: the &quot;Urge Bass&quot; and the &quot;Urge II Bass&quot; upgrade with a D-Drop Tuner. Features include a sleek alder body, a graphite reinforced maple neck with a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard, a pair of dual-coil Ceramic Noiseless Jazz Bass single-coils (neck/bridge), a custom-wound split-coil Precision Bass humbucking pickup (middle) and a 3-band active EQ with 18V power supply. These basses were discontinued in 2010. Hamm then had his own Washburn signature models since 2011, the AB40SH acoustic bass and the Hammer, featuring EMG pickups, Hipshot bridge/tuners and a 3-band active EQ - followed by a fretless version (SHBH3FLTSS) and the Stuart Hamm Electric Bass series, introduced on January 20, 2012. In 2014, he moved to Warwick basses and started work on a signature model based on his Washburn with the Warwick Streamer model shape.

Hamm&#x27;s slapping, popping and two-handed tapping techniques are demonstrated on his solo recordings, as well as in his instructional videos, &quot;Slap, Pop &amp; Tap For The Bass&quot; and &quot;Deeper Inside the Bass&quot;. A popular part of his live performance often includes a two-handed tapping arrangement of Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; (from the animated television special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;).

Since March 2011, Hamm has performed with &quot;The Deadlies,&quot; houseband for KOFY-TV&#x27;s &quot;Creepy KOFY Movie Time.&quot;

In July 2011, Hamm accepted the position of Director of Bass Programs at Musician&#x27;s Institute in Hollywood, California. For the past two decades, Hamm has also toured as one of the world&#x27;s premier bass clinicians.

<text>Lucius Aurelius Verus (; 15 December 130 – 23 January 169) was Roman emperor from 161 until his death in 169, alongside his adoptive brother Marcus Aurelius. He was a member of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. Verus&#x27; succession together with Marcus Aurelius marked the first time that the Roman Empire was ruled by more than one emperor simultaneously, an increasingly common occurrence in the later history of the Empire.

Born on 15 December 130, he was the eldest son of Lucius Aelius Caesar, first adopted son and heir to Hadrian. Raised and educated in Rome, he held several political offices prior to taking the throne. After his biological father&#x27;s death in 138, he was adopted by Antoninus Pius, who was himself adopted by Hadrian. Hadrian died later that year, and Antoninus Pius succeeded to the throne. Antoninus Pius would rule the empire until 161, when he died, and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius, who later raised his adoptive brother Verus to co-emperor.

As emperor, the majority of his reign was occupied by his direction of the war with Parthia which ended in Roman victory and some territorial gains. After initial involvement in the Marcomannic Wars, he fell ill and died in 169. He was deified by the Roman Senate as the Divine Verus (&quot;Divus Verus&quot;).

== Early life ==
Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus on 15 December 130, Verus was the first-born son of Avidia and Lucius Aelius Caesar, the first adopted son and heir of Emperor Hadrian. He was born and raised in Rome. Verus had two sisters, Ceionia Fabia and Ceionia Plautia. His maternal grandparents were the senator Gaius Avidius Nigrinus and the unattested noblewoman Plautia. 

When his father died on 1 January 138, Hadrian chose Titus Aurelius Antoninus as his new heir, giving him the title of &quot;caesar&quot;. Antoninus was instructed to adopt Lucius alongside Marcus, Hadrian&#x27;s nephew by marriage. By this scheme, Lucius, who was already Hadrian&#x27;s adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained as such through his new father. Antoninus also betrothed his daughter Faustina to Lucius, although the arrangement was canceled soon after.

Immediately after Hadrian&#x27;s death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus&#x27; betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus&#x27; daughter, instead. Faustina&#x27;s betrothal to Ceionia&#x27;s brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus&#x27; proposal.

As a prince and future emperor, Verus received careful education from the famous &quot;grammaticus&quot; Marcus Cornelius Fronto. He was reported to have been an excellent student, fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. Verus started his political career as a quaestor in 153 (one year before the legal age), became consul in 154, and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius.

== Emperor ==

=== Accession of Lucius and Marcus (161) ===
Antoninus died on 7 March 161, and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius bore deep affection for Antoninus, as evidenced by the first book of &quot;Meditations&quot;. Although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.

The senate accepted, granting Lucius the &quot;imperium&quot;, the tribunician power, and the title &quot;augustus&quot;. Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus&#x27;s original cognomen, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus. It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.

In spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more &quot;auctoritas&quot;, or authority, than Verus. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Pius&#x27; administration, and he alone was &quot;Pontifex maximus&quot;. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer wrote, &quot;Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.&quot;

Immediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria, the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as &quot;imperatores&quot;. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative. This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 sesterces (5,000 denarii) per capita, and more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years&#x27; pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors. The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus&#x27; accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.

Pius&#x27;s funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, &quot;elaborate&quot;. If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, while his spirit would rise to the gods&#x27; home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Pius&#x27;s campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors&#x27; wishes.

A &quot;flamen&quot;, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Pius, now &quot;Divus Antoninus&quot;. Pius&#x27;s remains were laid to rest in Hadrian&#x27;s mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus&#x27;s children and of Hadrian himself. The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.

=== Early rule (161–162) ===

Soon after the emperors&#x27; accession, Marcus&#x27;s eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle). At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their &quot;civiliter&quot; (lacking pomp) behavior.

The emperors permitted free speech, evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, &quot;No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.&quot;

Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils&#x27; accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly. The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: &quot;There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.&quot; Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.

Lucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors. Marcus told Fronto of his reading—Coelius and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-aunt Matidia Minor; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them.

The emperors&#x27; early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection. Some minor troubles cropped up in the spring; there would be more later. In the spring of 162, the Tiber flooded over its banks, destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention. In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.

=== War with Parthia (161–166) ===


==== Origins to Lucius&#x27;s dispatch (161–162) ====
On his deathbed, Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own—Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself.

At the time of the invasion, the Governor of Syria was Lucius Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161, presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrong-foot his replacement. The Governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living in the east had a deleterious effect on his character.

Severianus had fallen under the influence of Alexander of Abonoteichus, a self-proclaimed prophet who carried a snake named Glycon around with him, but was really only a confidence man. Alexander was father-in-law to the respected senator Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, then-proconsul of Asia, and friends with many members of the east Roman elite. Alexander convinced Severianus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself.

Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX Hispana) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegeia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.

There was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over the &quot;limes&quot;. Marcus was unprepared. Pius seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Pius&#x27;s twenty-three-year reign at his emperor&#x27;s side—and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early careers. Marcus made the necessary appointments: Marcus Statius Priscus, the Governor of Britain, was sent to replace Severianus as Governor of Cappadocia. Sextus Calpurnius Agricola took Priscus&#x27;s former office.

===== Strategic emergency in the East =====

More news arrived: Attidius Cornelianus&#x27;s army had been defeated in battle against the Parthians, and retreated in disarray. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. Publius Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions. Three full legions were also sent east: I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany, II Adiutrix from Aquincum, and V Macedonica from Troesmis.

The northern frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible. Attidius Cornelianus himself was replaced by Marcus Annius Libo, Marcus&#x27;s first cousin. He was young—his first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirties—and, as a mere patrician, lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.

Marcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday. Fronto replied ironically: &quot;What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?&quot; He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the &quot;palaestra&quot;, fishing, and comedy), going so far as to write up a fable about the gods&#x27; division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure. Marcus could not take Fronto&#x27;s advice. &quot;I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,&quot; he wrote back. Marcus put on Fronto&#x27;s voice to chastise himself: &quot;&#x27;Much good has my advice done you&#x27;, you will say.&quot; He had rested, and would rest often, but &quot;—this devotion to duty. Who knows better than you how demanding it is?&quot;

Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, including Cicero&#x27;s &quot;pro lege Manilia&quot;, in which the orator had argued in favor of Pompey taking supreme command in the Mithridatic War. It was an apt reference (Pompey&#x27;s war had taken him to Armenia), and may have had some impact on the decision to send Lucius to the eastern front. &quot;You will find in it many chapters aptly suited to your present counsels, concerning the choice of army commanders, the interests of allies, the protection of provinces, the discipline of the soldiers, the qualifications required for commanders in the field and elsewhere [...]&quot; To settle his unease over the course of the Parthian War, Fronto wrote Marcus a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto&#x27;s works, it is labeled &quot;De bello Parthico&quot; (&quot;On the Parthian War&quot;). There had been reverses in Rome&#x27;s past, Fronto writes, at Allia, at Caudium, at Cannae, at Numantia, Cirta, and Carrhae; under Trajan, Hadrian, and Pius; but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: &quot;always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs&quot;.

==== Lucius&#x27;s dispatch and journey east (162–163?) ====

Over the winter of 161–62, as more troubling news arrived—a rebellion was brewing in Syria—it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian War in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity. Lucius&#x27;s biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius&#x27;s debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor. Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left. Marcus remained in Rome; the city &quot;demanded the presence of an emperor&quot;.

Furius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was sent with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, M. Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and M. Iallius Bassus, and part of the praetorian guard. Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs. Moreover, he was far more qualified than his praetorian partner, Cornelius Repentinus, who was said to owe his office to the influence of Pius&#x27;s mistress, Galeria Lysistrate. Repentinus had the rank of a senator, but no real access to senatorial circles—his was merely a decorative title. Since a prefect had to accompany the guard, Victorinus was the clear choice.

Laelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and Governor of Syria in 153; thus he had first-hand knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made &quot;comes Augustorum&quot; (&quot;companion of the emperors&quot;) for his service. Laelianus was, in the words of Fronto, &quot;a serious man and an old-fashioned disciplinarian&quot;. Bassus had been Governor of Lower Moesia, and was also made &quot;comes&quot;. Lucius selected his favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, Eclectus, and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as &quot;praefectus vehiculorum&quot; to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force. The fleet of Misenum was charged with transporting the Emperor and general communications and transport.

Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus followed him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed. Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him. Fronto was upset at the news, but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days&#x27; fasting and a bloodletting.

Verus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens, accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, and joined the Eleusinian Mysteries. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Publius Vedius Antoninus, and made an unexpected stopover at Erythrae. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch. It is not known how long Verus&#x27;s journey east took; he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.

==== Luxury and logistics at Antioch (162?–165) ====
Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch. He took up a mistress named Panthea, from Smyrna. The biographer calls her a &quot;low-born girl-friend&quot;, but she was described as a &quot;woman of perfect beauty&quot; by Lucius. One biographer has postulated that Panthea may have been more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles&#x27; statues. The mistress was musically inclined and spoke Ionic Greek, spiced with Attic wit.

Panthea read Lucian&#x27;s first draft, and criticized him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess, which frightened her—she did not want to become the next Cassiopeia. She had power, too. She made Lucius shave his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this, as they did for much else.

Critics decried Lucius&#x27; luxurious lifestyle. He had taken to gambling, they said; he would &quot;dice the whole night through&quot;. He enjoyed the company of actors. He made a special request for dispatches from Rome, to keep him updated on how his chariot teams were doing. He brought a golden statue of the Greens&#x27; horse Volucer around with him, as a token of his team spirit. Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims: the Roman people needed Lucius&#x27; bread and circuses to keep them in check.

This, at least, is how the biographer has it. The whole section of the &quot;vita&quot; dealing with Lucius&#x27; debaucheries (&quot;HA Verus&quot; 4.4–6.6) is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others take and elaborate something from the original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.

Lucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling Corbulo&#x27;s arrival one hundred years before. The Syrian army had turned soft during the east&#x27;s long peace. They spent more time at the city&#x27;s open-air cafés than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed. Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay.

Lucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: &quot;not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy&quot;. Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius&#x27; reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius&#x27; presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.

Lucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes. Because the river breaks across a cliff before reaching the city, Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was completed, the Orontes&#x27; old riverbed dried up, exposing massive bones—the bones of a giant. Pausanias says they were from a beast &quot;more than eleven cubits&quot; tall; Philostratus says that it was &quot;thirty cubits&quot; tall. The oracle at Claros declared that they were the bones of the river&#x27;s spirit. These bones would later be understood to be that of several large unspecified animals.
In the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus&#x27; daughter Lucilla. Lucilla&#x27;s thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius&#x27; father.

Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception. Lucilla would bear three of Lucius&#x27; children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.

==== Counterattack and victory (163–166) ====
I Minervia and V Macedonica, under the legates M. Claudius Fronto and P. Martius Verus, served under Statius Priscus in Armenia, earning success for Roman arms during the campaign season of 163, including the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata. At the end of the year, Verus took the title &quot;Armeniacus&quot;, despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year. When Lucius was hailed as &quot;imperator&quot; again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the &quot;Imperator II&quot; with him. The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Gemina&#x27;s legate Geminius Marcianus.
Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis (&#x27;New City&#x27;), replaced Artaxata. On Birley&#x27;s reckoning, it was thirty miles closer to the Roman border. Detachments from Cappadocian legions are attested at Echmiadzin, beneath the southern face of Mount Ararat, 400 km east of Satala. It would have meant a march of twenty days or more, through mountainous terrain, from the Roman border; a &quot;remarkable example of imperialism&quot;, in the words of Fergus Millar.

A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, Gaius Julius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Verus sat on a throne with his staff while Sohaemus stood before him, saluting the emperor.

In 163, while Statius Priscus was occupied in Armenia, the Parthians intervened in Osroene, a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia, just east of Syria, with its capital at Edessa. They deposed the country&#x27;s leader, Mannus, and replaced him with their own nominee, who would remain in office until 165. (The Edessene coinage record actually begins at this point, with issues showing Vologases IV on the obverse and &quot;Wael the king&quot; (Syriac: W&#x27;L MLK&#x27;) on the reverse). In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point.

On the evidence of Lucian, the Parthians still held the southern, Roman bank of the Euphrates (in Syria) as late as 163 (he refers to a battle at Sura, which is on the southern side of the river). Before the end of the year, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank. Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town south-west of Edessa. There was little movement in 164; most of the year was spent on preparations for a renewed assault on Parthian territory.

==== Invasion of Mesopotamia (165) ====
In 165, Roman forces, perhaps led by Martius Verus and the V Macedonica, moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, Mannus re-installed. His coinage resumed, too: &#x27;Ma&#x27;nu the king&#x27; (Syriac: M&#x27;NW MLK&#x27;) or Antonine dynasts on the obverse, and &#x27;King Mannos, friend of Romans&#x27; (Greek: &quot;Basileus Mannos Philorōmaios&quot;) on the reverse. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris; their general Chosrhoes swam down the river and made his hideout in a cave. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.

By the end of the year, Cassius&#x27; army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire, one of Alexander the Great&#x27;s successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius&#x27; reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first. Whatever the case, the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucia&#x27;s long decline.

Cassius&#x27; army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely. Iunius Maximus, a young &quot;tribunus laticlavius&quot; serving in III Gallica under Cassius, took the news of the victory to Rome. Maximus received a generous cash bounty (&quot;dona&quot;) for bringing the good news, and immediate promotion to the quaestorship. Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as &quot;imperatores&quot; again, earning the title &#x27;imp. III&#x27;. Cassius&#x27; army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title &#x27;Medicus&#x27;, and the emperors were again hailed as &quot;imperatores&quot;, becoming &#x27;imp. IV&#x27; in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.

Most of the credit for the war&#x27;s success must be ascribed to subordinate generals. The forces that advanced on Osroene were led by M. Claudius Fronto, an Asian provincial of Greek descent who had led I Minervia in Armenia under Priscus. He was probably the first senator in his family. Fronto was consul for 165, probably in honor of the capture of Edessa. P. Martius Verus had led V Macedonica to the front, and also served under Priscus. Martius Verus was a westerner, whose &quot;patria&quot; was perhaps Tolosa in Gallia Narbonensis.

The most prominent general, however, was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was a young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian&#x27;s &quot;ab epistulis&quot;, followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian&#x27;s reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings. Cassius and Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166.

=== Years in Rome ===
The next two years (166–168) were spent in Rome. According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Verus continued with his glamorous lifestyle and kept the troupe of actors and favourites with him. He had a tavern built in his house, probably at Acquatraversa, where he celebrated parties with his friends until dawn. He also enjoyed roaming around the city among the population, without acknowledging his identity. The games of the circus were another passion in his life, especially chariot racing. Marcus Aurelius disapproved of his conduct but, since Verus continued to perform his official tasks with efficiency, there was little that he could do.

=== Wars on the Danube and death ===
In 168 war broke out in the Danubian border when the Marcomanni invaded the Roman territory. This war would last until 180, but Verus did not see the end of it. In 168, as Verus and Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome from the field, Verus fell severely ill and died soon afterwards. Some authors suggest that he was poisoned, but this is unlikely. He may have died due to the widespread epidemic known as the Antonine Plague.

Despite the minor differences between them, Marcus Aurelius grieved the loss of his adoptive brother. He accompanied the body to Rome, where he offered games to honour his memory. After the funeral, the senate declared Verus divine to be worshipped as &quot;Divus Verus&quot;.

<doc id="144113" wikidata="Q958413" url="?curid=144113" title="H. R. Haldeman">
<text>Harry Robbins &quot;Bob&quot; Haldeman (October 27, 1926 – November 12, 1993) was an American political aide and businessman, best known for his service as White House Chief of Staff to President Richard Nixon and his consequent involvement in the Watergate scandal.

Born in California, Haldeman served in the Navy Reserves in World War II and attended UCLA. In 1949, he joined the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, where he worked for 20 years as a prominent advertising executive in both Los Angeles and New York City. He made a name for himself early in Los Angeles social circles from his work as chairman of the UCLA Alumni Association and a member of the University of California Board of Regents.

A long family association with the Republican Party and his own interest drew Haldeman to politics. In the 1950s, he became acquainted with Nixon, for whom he developed both an intense respect and steadfast loyalty. He began as an advance man on President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s reelection campaign in 1956, again worked as an advance man on Nixon&#x27;s 1960 presidential campaign, and managed Nixon&#x27;s 1962 run for governor of California. When Nixon was elected President in 1968, he selected Haldeman as his chief of staff.

Haldeman is credited with implementing more significant changes to White House staffing systems and Executive Branch governance and operations than any chief of staff before him or since, and it is the &quot;Haldeman system&quot; that presidential administrations continue to operate on today. His intensity and no-nonsense management style earned him a reputation as a stern taskmaster who expected top-notch performance.

After he left the Nixon administration in April 1973, Haldeman was tried on counts of perjury, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice for his role in the Watergate cover-up. He was found guilty and imprisoned for 18 months. Upon Haldeman&#x27;s release, he returned to private life and was a successful businessman and real estate developer until his death from cancer in 1993 at the age of 67.

==Early life==
Haldeman was born in Los Angeles on October 27, 1926, one of three children of socially prominent parents. His father, Harry Francis Haldeman, founded and ran a successful heating and air conditioning supply company, and gave time and financial support to local Republican causes, including the Richard Nixon financial fund that led to the so-called &quot;Fund Crisis&quot; during the 1952 presidential race. His mother, Katherine (née Robbins), was a longtime volunteer with the Salvation Army and other philanthropic organizations. His paternal grandfather, Harry Marston Haldeman, co-founded the Better America Federation of California, The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, and a gentleman&#x27;s club named The Uplifters. Young Haldeman and his siblings were raised as Christian Scientists. Known to his peers as a &quot;straight arrow&quot;, he sported his trademark flat-top haircut from his high school years – a look that he would adopt for most of his life until after his resignation as Chief of Staff – enjoyed discussions of ethics, and achieved the rank of Life Scout. He attended Harvard School, an elite boys prep school, during which time he met Joanne &quot;Jo&quot; Horton, who was attending Marlborough School, an elite, private secondary school which educated women in the 7th to 12th grades. The two married in 1949.

During World War II he was in the United States Navy Reserve but did not see active combat. Haldeman attended the University of Redlands and the University of Southern California, then transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He received his B.A. from UCLA in 1948, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. At UCLA, he met John Ehrlichman, who became a close friend and colleague in the Nixon administration.

==Career==
In 1949, he joined the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, where he worked for 20 years in both Los Angeles and New York City; other employees of this firm during this period included Ronald Ziegler, who went on to serve as White House Press Secretary in the Nixon administration.

A long family association with the Republican Party and his own interest drew Haldeman to politics and during this period he commenced working for Richard Nixon, for whom he developed both an intense respect and steadfast loyalty. Beginning as an advance man on Nixon&#x27;s 1956 and 1960 campaigns, Haldeman managed Nixon&#x27;s 1962 run for governor of California, and when Nixon was elected President in 1968, he chose Haldeman to be his chief of staff.

==Nixon administration==

When Haldeman&#x27;s appointment to the White House was announced, Robert Rutland, a close friend and presidential scholar, urged him to start keeping a daily diary recording the major events of each day and Haldeman&#x27;s thoughts on them. Haldeman took this suggestion and started keeping and maintaining a daily diary throughout his entire career in the Nixon White House (January 18, 1969 – April 30, 1973). The full text of the diaries is almost 750,000 words, and an abridged version was published as &quot;The Haldeman Diaries&quot; after Haldeman&#x27;s death. A full version is available to researchers at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.

Gaining a reputation as a stern taskmaster who expected top-notch work, he and John Ehrlichman were called &quot;the Berlin Wall&quot; by other White House staffers in a play on their German family names and shared penchant for keeping others away from Nixon and serving as his &quot;gatekeepers&quot;. They became Nixon&#x27;s most loyal and trusted aides during his presidency. Both were keen in protecting what they regarded as Nixon&#x27;s best interests. He and the president were very close – Haldeman was even dubbed &quot;the president&#x27;s son-of-a-bitch&quot; – and Nixon relied on him to filter information that came into his office and to make sure that information was properly dispensed.

===Role in Watergate===
Haldeman was one of the various key figures in the Watergate scandal.

The &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; tape revealed that Nixon instructed Haldeman to have the CIA pressure the FBI into dropping its Watergate investigation. Nixon instructed him to tell the CIA that the investigation would &quot;open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again&quot;. In his book, Haldeman later wrote: &quot;It seems that in all those references to the Bay of Pigs, he was actually referring to the Kennedy assassination.&quot; He also said that Nixon might have been reminding CIA Director Richard Helms that the CIA assassination attempts on Fidel Castro may have triggered the assassination of Kennedy.

The unexplained minute gap in Nixon&#x27;s Oval Office recordings occurred during a discussion that included the President and Haldeman on June 20, 1972.

Nixon requested the resignations of Haldeman and Ehrlichman in what has been described as a long and emotional meeting at Camp David. Haldeman resigned, and the resignations were announced on April 30, 1973. In a phone conversation shortly after the resignations, Nixon told Haldeman that he loved him like his brother. On the eve of Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Haldeman asked for a full pardon along with a full pardon of Vietnam War draft dodgers. He argued that pardoning the draft dodgers would take some of the heat off him. Nixon refused.

On January 1, 1975, Haldeman was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and three counts of perjury. He was sentenced to serve to 8 years, subsequently commuted to 1 to 4 years. In Lompoc Federal Prison, Haldeman worked in a facility testing sewage. On December 20, 1978, after serving 18 months, Haldeman was released on parole.

In 1978, Times Books published &quot;The Ends of Power&quot;, written by Haldeman with the writer Joseph DiMona. Haldeman wrote in the book that Nixon had initiated the break-in and had participated in the cover-up from the onset.

A passage in &quot;The Ends of Power&quot; has been claimed to support allegations linking Watergate to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

James Woods portrayed Haldeman in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Nixon&quot;, which presents the scenario that Nixon attempted to use the CIA&#x27;s hidden anti-Castro history to help cover up his own misdeeds during Watergate. Stone credited the comments attributed to Haldeman in &quot;The Ends of Power&quot; as the source for his scenario.

According to political commentator Chris Matthews, Haldeman denied writing those words and said the theory of events actually belonged to DiMona. Matthews reported that Haldeman said he had no idea of what Nixon meant by the &quot;whole Bay of Pigs thing&quot; comments. Noting that Stone had implicated Nixon as having a role in planning a plot to kill Castro, Howard Rosenberg described it as &quot;one of the most controversial themes of his movie&quot;. A response by &quot;Nixon&quot; writers Steven Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson stated that DiMona, Haldeman&#x27;s ghostwriter, had confirmed that it was Haldeman&#x27;s conclusion that &quot;the Bay of Pigs thing&quot; was a code for the Kennedy assassination.

==Later life==
In his post-prison years, Haldeman went on to have a successful career as a businessman. Haldeman and Buzz Aldrin, representing Americom International Corp in collaboration with Radisson Hotels, signed an agreement to establish the first U.S. hotel and business complex venture within the former Soviet Union in Moscow. This agreement was signed during a ceremony held in conjunction with the US-USSR Trade and Economic Council. Haldeman also worked on development and real estate, and opened eight Sizzler Steak Houses in Florida.

==Death==
On November 12, 1993, after refusing medical treatment in accordance with his Christian Science beliefs, Haldeman died of abdominal cancer at his home in Santa Barbara, California. He was survived by his wife of almost 45 years, the former Joanne Horton, and their four children – Susan, Harry (Hank), Peter, and Ann.

Upon Haldeman&#x27;s death, Richard Nixon said in a statement, &quot;I have known Bob Haldeman to be a man of rare intelligence, strength, integrity and courage. He played an indispensable role in turbulent times as our Administration undertook a broad range of initiatives at home and abroad.&quot; His White House diaries were released posthumously as &quot;The Haldeman Diaries&quot; in 1994. Nixon died a few months later on April 22 1994 of a stroke age 81

<doc id="144121" wikidata="Q5611761" url="?curid=144121" title="Growth management">
<text>Growth management, in the United States, is a set of techniques used by the government to ensure that as the population grows that there are services available to meet their demands. Growth management goes beyond traditional land use planning, zoning and subdivision controls in both the characteristics of development influenced and the scope of government powers used. These are not necessarily only government services. Other demands such as the protection of natural spaces, sufficient and affordable housing, delivery of utilities, preservation of buildings and places of historical value, and sufficient places for the conduct of business are also considered.

==California studies==

Jurisdictions throughout the United States have experimented with local growth management measures designed to limit the growth of residential or commercial development within their jurisdiction or to shift them to areas with less development. Glickfeld and Levine conducted two major studies of growth management measures in virtually all California cities and counties in 1988 and 1992. The first study inquired about 18 different types of growth management measures. The vast majority of the jurisdictions had adopted one or more growth management measures to affect residential, commercial or new development. These varied from requiring adequate service levels as a condition for receiving approval to construct residential or commercial developments to measures that reduced permitted residential density to measures that restricted the height of buildings or the floor area ratio on a given parcel. Typically, jurisdictions near the Pacific coastline had more restrictions than those in the interior of the state.

The second study showed that over the four-year period between the two surveys the cumulative effect of growth-management legislation showed no relationship to permitted construction values for California as a whole when controlling for population growth and interest rates.

However, a follow-up study showed that the measures helped displace new construction from the metropolitan areas to the interiors of the state with low income and minority populations being particularly impacted. That is, the measures did not affect overall construction levels in California but did affect where new construction was built.

==Comprehensive planning==

The application of growth management techniques is often governed by the development of a comprehensive plan. The plan can be used to measure the impact that new growth will have on the community and define the method by which that impact is mitigated. Several states have adopted state measures to govern local growth management ordinances. Pioneers in statewide United States growth management were Oregon, which established Urban Growth Boundaries in the 1970s and Florida which passed the Growth Management Act in 1985.

<doc id="144123" wikidata="Q192506" url="?curid=144123" title="Vladimir Horowitz">
<text>Vladimir Samoylovich Horowitz (November 5, 1989) was a Russian and American pianist. Considered one of the greatest pianists of all time, he was known for his virtuoso technique, timbre, and the public excitement engendered by his playing.

==Life and early career==

Horowitz was born on October 1, 1903, in Kiev, then in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine). According to Nicolas Slonimsky, Horowitz was born in Berdichev, a city near Zhitomir in the Volhynian Governorate. However, his birth certificate states that Kiev was his birthplace.

He was the youngest of four children of Samuil Horowitz and Sophia (&quot;née&quot; Bodik), who were assimilated Jews. His father was a well-to-do electrical engineer and a distributor of electric motors for German manufacturers. His grandfather Joachim was a merchant (and an arts-supporter), belonging to the First Merchant&#x27;s Guild, which exempted him from having to reside in the Pale of Settlement. In order to make him appear too young for military service so as not to risk damaging his hands, Samuil took a year off his son&#x27;s age by claiming that he was born in 1904. The 1904 date appeared in many reference works during Horowitz&#x27;s lifetime.

His uncle Alexander was a pupil and close friend of Alexander Scriabin. When Horowitz was 10, it was arranged for him to play for Scriabin, who told his parents that he was extremely talented.

Horowitz received piano instruction from an early age, initially from his mother, who was herself a pianist. In 1912 he entered the Kiev Conservatory, where he was taught by Vladimir Puchalsky, Sergei Tarnowsky, and Felix Blumenfeld. His first solo recital was in Kharkov in 1920.

Horowitz soon began to tour Russia and the Soviet Union, where he was often paid with bread, butter and chocolate rather than money, due to the economic hardship caused by the Russian Civil War. During the 1922–23 season, he performed 23 concerts of eleven different programs in Petrograd alone. Despite his early success as a pianist, he maintained that he wanted to be a composer and undertook a career as a pianist only to help his family, who had lost their possessions in the Russian Revolution.

In December 1925, Horowitz emigrated to Germany, ostensibly to study with Artur Schnabel in Berlin but secretly intending not to return. He stuffed American dollars and British pound notes into his shoes to finance his initial concerts.

==Career in the West==
On December 18, 1925, Horowitz made his first appearance outside his home country, in Berlin. He later played in Paris, London, and New York City. In 1926, the Soviet Union selected Horowitz to join the delegation of pianists that were to represent the country at the I International Chopin Piano Competition in Poland in 1927, but he decided to remain in the West and did not participate.

Horowitz gave his United States debut on January 12, 1928, in Carnegie Hall. He played Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 under the direction of Sir Thomas Beecham, who was also making his U.S. debut. Horowitz later said that he and Beecham had divergent ideas about tempos and that Beecham was conducting the score &quot;from memory and he didn&#x27;t know&quot; the piece. Horowitz&#x27;s rapport with his audience was phenomenal. Olin Downes, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was critical about the tug of war between conductor and soloist, but credited Horowitz with both a beautiful singing tone in the second movement and a tremendous technique in the finale, calling his playing a &quot;tornado unleashed from the steppes&quot;. In this debut performance, Horowitz demonstrated a marked ability to excite his audience, an ability he maintained for his entire career. Downes wrote: &quot;it has been years since a pianist created such a furor with an audience in this city.&quot; In his review of Horowitz&#x27;s solo recital, Downes characterized the pianist&#x27;s playing as showing &quot;most if not all the traits of a great interpreter.&quot; In 1933, he played for the first time with the conductor Arturo Toscanini in a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5. Horowitz and Toscanini went on to perform together many times, on stage and in recordings. Horowitz settled in the U.S. in 1939 and became an American citizen in 1944. He made his television debut in a concert taped at Carnegie Hall on February 1, 1968, and broadcast nationwide by CBS on September 22 of that year.

Despite rapturous receptions at recitals, Horowitz became increasingly unsure of his abilities as a pianist. On several occasions, the pianist had to be pushed onto the stage. He suffered from depression and withdrew from public performances from 1936 to 1938, 1953 to 1965, 1969 to 1974, and 1983 to 1985.

===Recordings===


In 1926, Horowitz performed on several piano rolls at the Welte-Mignon studios in Freiburg, Germany. His first recordings were made in the United States for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1928. Horowitz&#x27;s first European-produced recording, made in 1930 by The Gramophone Company/HMV, RCA Victor&#x27;s UK based affiliate, was of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 with Albert Coates and the London Symphony Orchestra, the world premiere recording of that piece. Through 1936, Horowitz continued to make recordings in the UK for HMV of solo piano repertoire, including his 1932 account of Liszt&#x27;s Sonata in B minor. Beginning in 1940, Horowitz&#x27;s recording activity was again concentrated for RCA Victor in the US. That year, he recorded Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, and in 1941, the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1, both with Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1959, RCA Victor issued a live 1943 performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto with Horowitz and Toscanini; generally considered superior to the 1941 studio recording, it was selected for induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame. During Horowitz&#x27;s second retirement, which began in 1953, he made a series of recordings for RCA Victor in his New York City townhouse, including LPs of Scriabin and Clementi. Horowitz&#x27;s first stereo recording, issued by RCA Victor in 1959, was devoted to Beethoven piano sonatas.

In 1962, Horowitz embarked on a series of recordings for Columbia Records. The best known are his 1965 return concert at Carnegie Hall and a 1968 recording from his television special, &quot;Vladimir Horowitz: a Concert at Carnegie Hall&quot;, televised by CBS. Horowitz continued making studio recordings, including a 1969 recording of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Kreisleriana&quot;, which was awarded the Prix Mondial du Disque.

In 1975, Horowitz returned to RCA and made live recordings for the company until 1983. He signed with Deutsche Grammophon in 1985, and made studio and live recordings until 1989, including his only recording of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 23. Four documentary films featuring Horowitz were made during this period, including the telecast of his April 20, 1986 Moscow recital. His final recording, for Sony Classical (formerly Columbia), was completed four days before his death and consisted of repertoire he had never previously recorded.

All of Horowitz&#x27;s recordings have been issued on compact disc, some several times. In the years following Horowitz&#x27;s death, CDs were issued containing previously unreleased performances. These included selections from Carnegie Hall recitals recorded privately for Horowitz from 1945 to 1951.

===Students===
Horowitz taught seven students between 1937 and 1962: Nico Kaufmann (1937), Byron Janis (1944–1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis described his relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited to become one of Horowitz&#x27;s students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period, saying &quot;Many young people say they have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three: Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it&#x27;s not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once a week. I stopped work with them because they did not progress.&quot; Plaskin remarks: &quot;The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of study says something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period.&quot; Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.

== Personal life ==
In 1933, in a civil ceremony, Horowitz married Wanda Toscanini, Arturo Toscanini&#x27;s daughter. Although Horowitz was Jewish and Wanda was Catholic, this was not an issue, because neither of them was religiously observant. Because Wanda knew no Russian and Horowitz knew very little Italian, their primary language was French.

Horowitz was close to his wife, who was one of the few people from whom Horowitz would accept a critique of his playing, and she stayed with Horowitz when he refused to leave the house during a period of depression. They had one child, Sonia Toscanini Horowitz (1934–1975). She was critically injured in a motorbike accident in 1957 but survived. She died in 1975. It has not been determined whether her death in Geneva, from a drug overdose, was accidental or a suicide.

Despite his marriage, there were persistent rumors of Horowitz&#x27;s homosexuality. Arthur Rubinstein said of Horowitz that &quot;[e]veryone knew and accepted him as a homosexual.&quot; David Dubal wrote that in his years with Horowitz, there was no evidence that the octogenarian was sexually active, but that &quot;there was no doubt he was powerfully attracted to the male body and was most likely often sexually frustrated throughout his life.&quot; Dubal felt that Horowitz sublimated a strong instinctual sexuality into a powerful erotic undercurrent communicated in his playing. Horowitz, who denied being homosexual, once joked, &quot;[t]here are three kinds of pianists: Jewish pianists, homosexual pianists, and bad pianists.&quot;

In an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in September 2013, Kenneth Leedom, an assistant of Horowitz for five years before 1955, said he had secretly been Horowitz&#x27;s lover:

We had a wonderful life together... He was a difficult man, to say the least. He had an anger in him that was unbelievable. The number of meals I&#x27;ve had thrown on the floor or in my lap. He&#x27;d pick up the tablecloth and just pull it off the table, and all the food would go flying. He had tantrums, a lot. But then he was calm and sweet. Very sweet, very lovable. And he really adored me.

In the 1940s, Horowitz began seeing a psychiatrist in an attempt to alter his sexual orientation. In the 1960s, and again in the 1970s, the pianist underwent electroshock treatment for depression.

In 1982, Horowitz began using prescribed antidepressant medications; there are reports that he was drinking as well. His playing underwent a perceptible decline during this period, with his 1983 performances in the United States and Japan marred by memory lapses and a loss of physical control. Hidekazu Yoshida, Japanese critic, likened Horowitz to a &quot;cracked rare, gorgeous antique vase.&quot; He stopped playing in public for two years.

==Last years==
In 1985, Horowitz, no longer taking medication or drinking alcohol, returned to performing and recording. His first post-retirement appearance was not on stage, but in the documentary film &quot;Vladimir Horowitz: The Last Romantic&quot;. In many of his later performances, although still capable of remarkable technical feats he substituted finesse and coloration for bravura. Many critics, including Harold C. Schonberg and Richard Dyer, felt that his post-1985 performances and recordings were the best of his later years.

In 1986, Horowitz announced that he would return to the Soviet Union for the first time since 1925 to give recitals in Moscow and Leningrad. In the new atmosphere of communication and understanding between the USSR and the US, these concerts were seen as events of political, as well as musical, significance. Most of the tickets for the Moscow concert were reserved for the Soviet elite and few sold to the general public. This resulted in a number of Moscow Conservatory students crashing the concert, which was audible to viewers of the internationally televised recital. The Moscow concert was released on a compact disc titled &quot;Horowitz in Moscow&quot;, which reigned at the top of Billboard&#x27;s Classical music charts for over a year. It was also released on VHS and, eventually, DVD. The concert was also widely seen on a Special Edition of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; with Charles Kuralt reporting from Moscow.

Following the Russian concerts, Horowitz toured several European cities, including Berlin, Amsterdam, and London. In June, Horowitz redeemed himself to the Japanese with a trio of well-received performances in Tokyo. Later that year he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States, by President Ronald Reagan.

Horowitz&#x27;s final tour took place in Europe in the spring of 1987. A video recording of his penultimate public recital, &quot;Horowitz in Vienna&quot;, was released in 1991. His final recital, at the Musikhalle Hamburg, Germany, took place on June 21, 1987. The concert was recorded, but not released until 2008. He continued to record for the remainder of his life.
==Death==
Horowitz died on November 5, 1989, in New York City, of a heart attack, aged 86. He was buried in the Toscanini family tomb in the Cimitero Monumentale, Milan, Italy.

==Repertoire, technique and performance style==
Horowitz is best known for his performances of the Romantic piano repertoire. Many consider Horowitz&#x27;s first recording of the Liszt Sonata in B minor in 1932 to be the definitive reading of that piece, even after over 90 years and more than 100 performances committed to disc by other pianists. Other pieces with which he was closely associated were Scriabin&#x27;s Étude in D-sharp minor, Chopin&#x27;s Ballade No. 1, and many Rachmaninoff miniatures, including &quot;Polka de W.R.&quot;. Horowitz was acclaimed for his recordings of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, and his performance before Rachmaninoff awed the composer, who proclaimed &quot;he swallowed it whole. He had the courage, the intensity, the daring.&quot; Horowitz was also known for his performances of quieter, more intimate works, including Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Kinderszenen&quot;, Scarlatti&#x27;s keyboard sonatas, keyboard sonatas by Clementi and several Mozart and Haydn sonatas. His recordings of Scarlatti and Clementi are particularly prized, and he is credited with having helped revive interest in the two composers, whose works had been seldom performed or recorded during the first half of the 20th century.

During World War II, Horowitz championed contemporary Russian music, giving the American premieres of Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7 and 8 (the so-called &quot;War Sonatas&quot;) and Kabalevsky&#x27;s Piano Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3. Horowitz also premiered the Piano Sonata and &quot;Excursions&quot; of Samuel Barber.

He was known for his versions of several of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot;. The &quot;Second Rhapsody&quot; was recorded in 1953, during Horowitz&#x27;s 25th anniversary concert at Carnegie Hall, and he said it was the most difficult of his arrangements. Horowitz&#x27;s transcriptions of note include his composition &quot;Variations on a Theme from Carmen&quot; and &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; by John Philip Sousa. The latter became a favorite with audiences, who would anticipate its performance as an encore. Transcriptions aside, Horowitz was not opposed to altering the text of compositions to improve what he considered &quot;unpianistic&quot; writing or structural clumsiness. In 1940, with the composer&#x27;s consent, Horowitz created his own performance edition of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Second Piano Sonata from the 1913 original and 1931 revised versions, which pianists including Ruth Laredo and Hélène Grimaud have used. Unfortunately, he never recorded the piece. He substantially rewrote Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; to make the work more effective on the grounds that Mussorgsky was not a pianist and did not understand the possibilities of the instrument. Horowitz also altered short passages in some works, such as substituting interlocking octaves for chromatic scales in Chopin&#x27;s Scherzo in B minor. This was in marked contrast to many pianists of the post–19th-century era, who considered the composer&#x27;s text sacrosanct. Living composers whose works Horowitz played (among them Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, and Poulenc) invariably praised Horowitz&#x27;s performances of their work even when he took liberties with their scores.

Horowitz&#x27;s interpretations were well received by concert audiences, but not by some critics. Virgil Thomson was consistently critical of Horowitz as a &quot;master of distortion and exaggeration&quot; in his reviews appearing in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Horowitz claimed to take Thomson&#x27;s remarks as complimentary, saying that Michelangelo and El Greco were also &quot;masters of distortion.&quot; In the 1980 edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Michael Steinberg wrote that Horowitz &quot;illustrates that an astounding instrumental gift carries no guarantee about musical understanding.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Harold C. Schonberg countered that reviewers such as Thomson and Steinberg were unfamiliar with 19th-century performance practices that informed Horowitz&#x27;s musical approach. Many pianists (such as Martha Argerich and Maurizio Pollini) hold Horowitz in high regard, and the pianist Friedrich Gulda referred to Horowitz as the &quot;Super-God of the piano&quot;.

Horowitz&#x27;s style frequently involved vast dynamic contrasts, with overwhelming double-fortissimos followed by sudden delicate pianissimos. He was able to produce an extraordinary volume of sound from the piano without producing a harsh tone. He elicited an exceptionally wide range of tonal color, and his taut, precise attack was noticeable even in his renditions of technically undemanding pieces such as the Chopin Mazurkas. He is known for his octave technique; he could play precise passages in octaves extraordinarily quickly. When asked by the pianist Tedd Joselson how he practiced octaves, Horowitz gave a demonstration and Joselson reported, &quot;He practiced them exactly as we were all taught to do.&quot; Music critic and biographer Harvey Sachs submitted that Horowitz may have been &quot;the beneficiary—and perhaps also the victim—of an extraordinary central nervous system and an equally great sensitivity to tone color.&quot; Oscar Levant, in his book &quot;The Memoirs of an Amnesiac&quot;, wrote that Horowitz&#x27;s octaves were &quot;brilliant, accurate and etched out like bullets.&quot; He asked Horowitz &quot;whether he shipped them ahead or carried them with him on tour.&quot;

Horowitz&#x27;s hand position was unusual in that the palm was often below the level of the key surface. He frequently played chords with straight fingers, and the little finger of his right hand was often curled up until it needed to play a note; to Harold C. Schonberg, &quot;it was like a strike of a cobra.&quot; For all the excitement of his playing, Horowitz rarely raised his hands higher than the piano&#x27;s . Byron Janis, one of Horowitz&#x27;s students, said that Horowitz tried to teach him that technique but it didn&#x27;t work for him. Horowitz&#x27;s body was immobile, and his face seldom reflected anything other than intense concentration.

Horowitz preferred to perform on Sunday afternoons, as he felt audiences were better rested and more attentive than on weekday evenings.

<doc id="144128" wikidata="Q1124410" url="?curid=144128" title="Jerusalem syndrome">
<text>Jerusalem syndrome is a group of mental phenomena involving the presence of religiously themed ideas or experiences that are triggered by a visit to the city of Jerusalem. It is not endemic to one single religion or denomination but has affected Jews, Christians, and Muslims of many different backgrounds. It is not listed as a recognised condition in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; or the &quot;International Classification of Diseases&quot;.

The best known, although not the most prevalent, manifestation of Jerusalem syndrome (classified as Type III) is the phenomenon whereby a person who seems previously balanced and devoid of any signs of psychopathology becomes psychotic after arriving in Jerusalem. The psychosis is characterised by an intense religious theme and typically resolves to full recovery after a few weeks or after being removed from the area. The religious focus of Jerusalem syndrome distinguishes it from other phenomena, such as Stendhal syndrome in Florence or Paris syndrome in Paris.

In a 2000 article in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, Bar-El et al. claim to have identified and described a specific syndrome which emerges in tourists with no previous abnormal psychiatric history. However, this claim has been disputed by M. Kalian and E. Witztum. Kalian and Witztum stressed that nearly all of the tourists who demonstrated the described behaviours were mentally ill prior to their arrival in Jerusalem. They further noted that, of the small proportion of tourists alleged to have exhibited spontaneous psychosis after arrival in Jerusalem, Bar-El et al. had presented no evidence that the tourists had been well prior to their arrival in the city.

==History==

Jerusalem syndrome has previously been regarded as a form of hysteria, referred to as &quot;&quot;. It was first clinically described in the 1930s by Jerusalem psychiatrist Heinz Hermann, one of the founders of modern psychiatric research in Israel. Whether or not these behaviors specifically arise from visiting Jerusalem is debated, as similar behaviors have been noted at other places of religious and historical importance such as Mecca and Rome (see Stendhal syndrome). It is known that cases of the syndrome had already been observed during the Middle Ages, since it was described in the itinerary of Felix Fabri and the biography of Margery Kempe. Other cases were described in the vast literature of visitors to Jerusalem during the 19th century.

Bar-El et al. suggested that at the approach of the year 2000, large numbers of otherwise normal visitors might be affected by a combination of their presence in Jerusalem and the religious significance of the millennium, causing a massive increase in the numbers of Jerusalem syndrome admissions to hospital. Despite a slight increase in tourist hospitalisations with the rise in total tourism to Jerusalem during the year 2000, the feared epidemic of Jerusalem syndrome never materialised.

==Types==
The classic Jerusalem syndrome, where a visit to Jerusalem seems to trigger an intense religious psychosis that resolves quickly after or on departure, has been a subject of debate in the medical literature. Most of the discussion has centered on whether this definition of the Jerusalem syndrome is a distinct form of psychosis, or simply a re-expression of a previously existing psychotic illness that was not picked up by the medical authorities in Israel.

In response to this, Bar-El et al. classified the syndrome into three major types to reflect the different types of interactions between a visit to Jerusalem and unusual or psychosis-related thought processes. However, Kalian and Witztum have objected, saying that Bar-El et al. presented no evidence to justify the detailed typology and prognosis presented and that the types in fact seem to be unrelated rather than different aspects of a syndrome.

===Type I===
&quot;Jerusalem syndrome imposed on a previous psychotic illness.&quot; This refers to individuals already diagnosed as having a psychotic illness before their visit to Jerusalem. They have typically gone to the city because of the influence of religious ideas, often with a goal or mission in mind that they believe needs to be completed on arrival or during their stay. For example, affected persons may believe themselves to be important historical religious figures or may be influenced by important religious ideas or concepts (such as causing the coming of the Messiah or the second coming of Christ).

===Type II===
&quot;Jerusalem syndrome superimposed on and complicated by idiosyncratic ideas.&quot; This does not necessarily take the form of mental illness and may simply be a culturally anomalous obsession with the significance of Jerusalem, either as an individual, or as part of a small religious group with idiosyncratic spiritual beliefs.

===Type III===
&quot;Jerusalem syndrome as a discrete form, uncompounded by previous mental illness.&quot; This describes the best-known type, whereby a previously mentally balanced person becomes psychotic after arriving in Jerusalem. It can include a paranoid belief that an agency is after the individual, causing their symptoms of psychosis through poisoning and medicating.

Bar-El et al. reported 42 such cases over a period of 13 years, but in no case were they able to actually confirm that the condition was temporary.

==Prevalence==
During a period of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center in Jerusalem were analysed, it was reported that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About three-and-a-half-million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly different from any other city.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Jerusalem Syndrome&quot;, a theater play by Joshua Sobol, deals with the fanaticism that led the destruction of the Jewish Second Temple.

In &quot;The X-Files&quot; (Season 3, Episode 11, &quot;Revelations,&quot;) released in 1995), the perpetrator is depicted as having &quot;Jerusalem Syndrome&quot; after a visit to the city. He returns to the US and begins to hunt down people with signs of stigmata.

In Robert Stone&#x27;s 1998 novel Damascus Gate, several characters are said to be afflicted with Jerusalem Syndrome.

The 2001 song &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was composed by James Raymond on the topic of the Jerusalem Syndrome. It appears on the 2001 record &quot;Just Like Gravity&quot;, by CPR (David Crosby, Jeff Pevar, James Raymond).

A 2006 film by Victor Braun titled &quot;Jerusalem syndrome&quot; tells the story of a Christian pilgrim with the syndrome.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2010 episode &quot;The Greatest Story Ever D&#x27;ohed&quot;, Homer develops Jerusalem syndrome while visiting Israel with his family as part of a tour group from Springfield. The illness and its effects on him become a central element of the episode&#x27;s plot. Eventually, most members of the tour group are overcome with Jerusalem syndrome, each one proclaiming that he/she is the messiah.

In the 2014 ABC series &quot;Black Box&quot;, the episode &quot;Jerusalem&quot; (Season 1, Episode 5) features a character diagnosed with Jerusalem syndrome after he becomes suddenly and compulsively religious during a trip to Israel.

The 2015 movie &quot;Jeruzalem&quot; features a character that is suspected to have the Jerusalem syndrome.

&quot;Jerusalem&quot;, the twelfth story in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2015 collection, &quot;Trigger Warning&quot;, centres around a British woman who comes down with the syndrome on holiday. She believes God is speaking to her and eventually flees her home to return to Jerusalem.

The catalog of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s 2016 show about an earlier era of the city&#x27;s history used the syndrome as the &quot;organizing metaphor&quot; for the first paragraph of the introduction, per a review.

In 2023 the York Theatre Company produced &quot;The Jerusalem Syndrome,&quot; a musical comedy written by Kyle Rosen, Laurence Holzman and Felicia Needleman, and directed by Don Stephenson. The 14-person cast included Farah Alvin and Lenny Wolpe.

<doc id="144134" wikidata="Q489705" url="?curid=144134" title="Academy Juvenile Award">
<text>The Academy Juvenile Award, also known informally as the Juvenile Oscar, was a Special Honorary Academy Award bestowed at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to specifically recognize performers under the age of eighteen for their &quot;outstanding contribution[s] to screen entertainment&quot;.

The honor was first awarded by the academy at the 7th Academy Awards to 6-year-old Shirley Temple for her work in motion pictures of 1934. The Award continued to be presented intermittently over the next 26 years to a total of 12 child actors and actresses, with the last Juvenile Oscar presented at the 33rd Academy Awards to 14-year-old Hayley Mills who received the child-size statuette for her performance in the 1960 film &quot;Pollyanna&quot;.

The trophy itself was a miniature Academy Award statuette standing an estimated seven inches tall (depending upon variations to its base over time), approximately half the height of the standard 13.5 inch tall Oscar trophy.

== Honorary Academy Awards ==

In addition to its competitive Academy Awards of Merit, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) also presents &quot;Special&quot; or &quot;Honorary&quot; Academy Awards. These awards are given (typically, annually) by the Board of Governors of AMPAS to celebrate motion picture achievements that are not covered by other existing Academy Awards categories. This included the awards that had been presented to juvenile actors from 1934 to 1960 (known only informally as the &quot;Juvenile Academy Awards&quot;).

Beginning with the 1st Academy Awards celebrating film achievements of 1927 and 1928 these awards were formally referred to as &quot;Special Awards&quot;. The first of these Special Awards was presented to Charles Chaplin (for &quot;The Circus&quot;) and to Warner Bros. (for &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;). Beginning with the 23rd Academy Awards celebrating film achievements of 1950 these Special Awards were formally renamed by the academy as &quot;Honorary Awards&quot;. These Honorary Awards continue to be presented today, although the &quot;Juvenile Academy Award&quot; proper has itself been discontinued.

== History of the Academy Juvenile Award ==

The Academy Awards, first presented on May 16, 1929, did not initially present a Special Award for juvenile actors. The very first child actor to be nominated for an Oscar was 9-year-old Jackie Cooper, who was nominated as Best Actor in 1931 for his work in the film &quot;Skippy&quot;. Cooper, however, lost that year to Lionel Barrymore. Recognizing that children could be placed at a disadvantage in the hearts and minds of Academy voters when nominated alongside their adult counterparts in the competitive Best Actor and Best Actress categories and with no categories for Best Supporting Actor or Supporting Actress having yet been created the academy saw the need to establish an Honorary &quot;Special Award&quot; specifically to recognize juveniles under the age of eighteen for their work in film.

On February 27, 1935, the 7th Annual Academy Awards, honoring achievements in film for the year 1934, became the first Oscar ceremony at which the Special Juvenile Award was presented. Playfully dubbed the &quot;Oscarette&quot; by Bob Hope in 1945, the statuette itself was a miniaturized Oscar, depicting an Art Deco image of a knight holding a crusader&#x27;s sword and standing on a reel of film. Standing approximately one-half the size of its full-sized counterpart, this rare child-sized trophy remained the prototype for the statuette throughout the history of the Award, with only relatively small modifications to its base over time.

After first being presented in 1935, the Special Juvenile Award continued to be presented intermittently to a total of 12 young actors and actresses over the next 26 years. However, there were several juvenile actors who were instead nominated in the competitive Best Supporting Actor/Actress categories during this time. These included, most notably: 14-year-old Bonita Granville as Best Supporting Actress of 1936 for &quot;These Three&quot;; 11-year-old Brandon deWilde as Best Supporting Actor of 1953 for &quot;Shane&quot;; 17-year-old Sal Mineo as Best Supporting Actor of 1955 for &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;; and 11-year-old Patty McCormack as Best Supporting Actress of 1956 for &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;. All of these nominees, however, lost to their adult counterparts in their respective categories.

Held on April 17, 1961, the 33rd Annual Academy Awards, honoring achievements in film for the year 1960, was the last Oscar ceremony at which the Honorary Juvenile Award was presented.

== Honorees of the Academy Juvenile Award ==
=== 1930s ===

The 7th Annual Academy Awards recognized Shirley Temple with the academy&#x27;s first Juvenile Award to honor &quot;her outstanding contribution to screen entertainment during the year 1934.&quot; Beginning her film career at the age of three, in 1934 Temple had attained child stardom in such films as &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot;, &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;, &quot;Baby Take a Bow&quot; and &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. Six years old on the night she accepted her honorary statuette, Temple is the youngest recipient ever to be honored by the academy.

The 11th Annual Academy Awards recognized both Deanna Durbin and Mickey Rooney with the Juvenile Award honoring &quot;their significant contribution in bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth&quot;. By 1938, 16-year-old Durbin was a rising star as the singing ingenue in such films as &quot;Mad About Music&quot; and &quot;That Certain Age&quot;, while Rooney had risen to fame in the &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; comedies and received critical acclaim for his dramatic turn in &quot;Boys Town&quot;. Eighteen years old on the night he accepted the accolade, Rooney was the oldest recipient ever to be honored with the academy&#x27;s Juvenile Award.

The 12th Annual Academy Awards recognized Judy Garland with the Juvenile Award honoring &quot;her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year&quot;. In 1939, 16-year-old Garland had become one of Hollywood&#x27;s brightest young stars, appearing that year in the MGM musicals &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Although she was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress of 1954, and again as Best Supporting Actress of 1961, the Juvenile Award was the only honor Garland received from the academy.

=== 1940s ===

The 17th Annual Academy Awards recognized Margaret O&#x27;Brien with the Juvenile Award honoring her as &quot;outstanding child actress of 1944&quot;. That year, 7-year-old O&#x27;Brien had become one of the most popular child actresses of her day, starring in the films &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, &quot;Music for Millions&quot;, and &quot;Meet Me In St. Louis&quot; alongside former Juvenile Award Honoree Judy Garland. Hosting the Annual ceremony that year was Bob Hope who dubbed the Juvenile Award the &quot;Oscarette&quot; upon presenting O&#x27;Brien with her miniature Oscar.

The 18th Annual Academy Awards recognized Peggy Ann Garner with the Juvenile Award honoring her as &quot;outstanding child actress of 1945&quot;. Beginning her prolific film career at the age of six, in 1945, 13-year-old Garner appeared in &quot;Nob Hill&quot; and &quot;Junior Miss&quot;, as well as receiving critical acclaim for her dramatic role as Francie Nolan, a girl living in the Brooklyn slums with her devoted mother and alcoholic father in the 20th Century Fox drama, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;.

The 19th Annual Academy Awards recognized Claude Jarman Jr. with the Juvenile Award honoring him as &quot;outstanding child actor of 1946&quot;. Twelve years old in 1946, Jarman was honored with the Juvenile Oscar for his screen debut as Jody in the MGM family drama, &quot;The Yearling&quot;, which was presented to him by former recipient Shirley Temple. Although the academy did not officially begin to present the Juvenile Award for a child&#x27;s work in a specific film until two years later, &quot;The Yearling&quot; was Jarman&#x27;s first and only film released in 1946.

The 21st Annual Academy Awards recognized Ivan Jandl with the Juvenile Award honoring him for &quot;the outstanding juvenile performance of 1948, as &#x27;Karel Malik&#x27; in &quot;The Search&quot;. Born in Czechoslovakia, and beginning his relatively brief film career in 1948 at the age of eleven, Jandl was the first foreign child actor to be honored with the Juvenile Oscar. Unable to travel to the United States to attend the ceremony, Jandl&#x27;s statuette was instead presented to him in his native Prague.

The 22nd Annual Academy Awards recognized Bobby Driscoll with the Juvenile Award honoring him as &quot;the outstanding juvenile actor of 1949&quot;. That year, 12-year-old Driscoll had starred in the Disney tear-jerker &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot;, as well as garnering critical acclaim for his dramatic performance in the RKO melodrama &quot;The Window&quot;. Demonstrating the prestige the Honorary Juvenile Award held for Hollywood child stars of the time, on the night of the ceremony, Driscoll nervously accepted his miniature statuette saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t ever think I&#x27;ve been so thrilled in my life.&quot;

=== 1950s1960 ===
The 27th Annual Academy Awards recognized both Jon Whiteley and Vincent Winter with the Juvenile Award honoring their &quot;outstanding juvenile performance(s) in &quot;The Little Kidnappers&quot;&quot;. Perhaps best known to audiences in their native Scotland, in 1953, Whiteley, age 8, and Winter, age 6, played Harry and Davy respectively, two boys living with their grandfather in Nova Scotia who, forbidden by their grandfather to have a dog, &quot;kidnap&quot; an unattended baby and care for the child as their own in the British produced family drama.

The 33rd Annual Academy Awards recognized Hayley Mills with what would be the last Juvenile Award, honoring her performance in &quot;Pollyanna&quot; as &quot;the most outstanding juvenile performance during 1960&quot;. Making her acting debut at the age of twelve alongside her father John Mills in the 1959 crime thriller &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;, in 1960, 13-year-old Mills made her Disney debut as the titular Pollyanna which also earned her a BAFTA Award nomination that same year as &quot;Best British Actress&quot;.

==List of honorees==


; Notes

==Post-juvenile era==
In 1962, 16-year-old Patty Duke starred in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; and in 1963, was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the film, becoming the youngest actress at the time to win an Academy Award of merit and, for the first time, demonstrating that a juvenile could win in a competitive category. From this point onward, child actors were recognized in competitive categories alongside their adult counterparts, or not at all.

, a total of three minors (including Duke) have won Oscars, all in the Best Supporting Actress category. The other two are Tatum O&#x27;Neal, who was 10, for &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973), and Anna Paquin, who was 11, for &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993). , O&#x27;Neal remains the youngest person to win a competitive Academy Award.

==Lost, stolen and found==
===Lost Garland award===
Judy Garland had reportedly lost her award over the years, and in June 1958 contacted the academy to obtain a replacement at her own expense. The academy obliged, but asked Garland to sign its well-known right of first refusal agreement covering the duplicate Oscar as well as her original, should it ever turn up. The agreement, put into implementation by the academy in 1950, states that Oscar recipients or their heirs who want to sell their statuettes must first offer the academy the opportunity to buy the Oscar back for the sum of $10. (An amount which was subsequently dropped to $1 in the 1980s.)

After her death in 1969, many of Garland&#x27;s personal effects came into the possession of her former husband, Sidney Luft who attempted to sell a miniature Oscar statuette at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 1993. Upon learning of the impending auction, the academy quickly filed a legal injunction to halt the sale of the Award and, after some research, determined that the statuette in question was Garland&#x27;s 1958 replacement Oscar, using photographs that showed the original 1940 statuette&#x27;s unique base differed from the one being put up for auction. The courts ruled in the academy&#x27;s favor in 1995 and ordered Luft to return the 1958 statuette to the academy; prompting Luft to instead turn the award over to daughter Lorna Luft who had expressed a desire to keep it in the family.

In 2000, a second statuette was put up for auction, which the academy determined this time to be Garland&#x27;s long-lost &quot;original&quot; 1940 Oscar. After once again tracing the auction back to Sidney Luft, the academy again took legal action to halt the sale claiming the 1940 statuette fell under the terms of the agreement Garland had signed in 1958. The academy again won its lawsuit in 2002 and Luft was ordered to turn the 1940 statuette over to the academy. In February 2010, Garland&#x27;s original 1940 Juvenile Oscar was put on display to the public at an exhibit held by the academy in New York City called &quot;Meet The Oscars&quot;. , its 1958 replacement is believed to still be in the possession of Garland&#x27;s heirs.

===Stolen O&#x27;Brien award===
Throughout her childhood, Margaret O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s awards were displayed in a special room. One day in 1954, the family&#x27;s maid asked to take O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Juvenile Oscar and two other awards home with her to polish, as she had done in the past. After three days, the maid failed to return to work, prompting O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother to discharge her, requesting that the awards be returned. Shortly thereafter, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother, who had been sick with a heart condition, suffered a relapse and died. In mourning, 17-year-old O&#x27;Brien forgot about the maid and the Oscar until several months later when she tried to contact her, only to find that the maid had moved and had left no forwarding address.

Several years later, upon learning that the original had been stolen, the academy promptly supplied O&#x27;Brien with a replacement Oscar, but O&#x27;Brien still held onto hope that she might one day recover her original Award. In the years that followed, O&#x27;Brien attended memorabilia shows and searched antique shops, hoping she might find the original statuette, until one day in 1995 when Bruce Davis, then executive director of the Academy, was alerted that a miniature statuette bearing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s name had surfaced in a catalogue for an upcoming memorabilia auction. Davis contacted a mutual friend of his and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, who in turn phoned O&#x27;Brien to tell her the long-lost Oscar had been found.

Memorabilia collectors Steve Neimand and Mark Nash were attending a flea market in 1995 when Neimand spotted a small Oscar with Margaret O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s name inscribed upon it. The two men decided to split the $500 asking price hoping to resell it at a profit and lent it to a photographer to shoot for an upcoming auction catalogue. This led to Bruce Davis&#x27; discovery that the statuette had resurfaced and, upon learning of the award&#x27;s history, Nash and Neimand agreed to return the Oscar to O&#x27;Brien. On February 7, 1995, almost fifty years after she had first received it, the academy held a special ceremony in Beverly Hills to return the stolen award to O&#x27;Brien. Upon being reunited with her Juvenile Oscar, Margaret O&#x27;Brien told the attending journalists:

===Stolen Mills award===
Hayley Mills was in California filming a television series in the late 1980s. When she returned home to London, her Oscar was gone. As Mills was the last person to win a miniature Oscar, she was told the mold had been broken and a new one could not be made. In 2022, Academy president David Rubin surprised Mills with a full sized replacement Oscar statuette.
