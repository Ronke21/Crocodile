<text>The International Meridian Conference was a conference held in October 1884 in Washington, D.C., in the United States, to determine a prime meridian for international use. The conference was held at the request of U.S. President Chester A. Arthur. The subject to discuss was the choice of &quot;a meridian to be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the world&quot;. It resulted in the recommendation of the Greenwich Meridian as the international standard for zero degrees longitude.

==Background==
By the 1870s there was pressure both to establish a prime meridian for worldwide navigation purposes and to unify local times for railway timetables. The first International Geographical Congress, held in Antwerp in 1871, passed a motion in favour of the use of the Greenwich Meridian for (smaller scale) passage charts, suggesting that it should become mandatory within 15years.
In Britain, the Great Western Railway had standardised time by 1840 and in 1847 the &quot;Railway Clearing Union&quot; decreed that &quot;GMT be adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it&quot;. The Post Office was by this time transmitting time signals from Greenwich by telegraph to most parts of the country to set the clocks. By January1848, Bradshaw&#x27;s railway guide showed the unified times and met with general approval, although legal disputes meant that it was not until 1880 that GMT was formally established across the UK.

In the United States, the problems were much more severe, with one table showing over 100 local times varying by more than 3hours. In 1870, Charles F. Dowd published a pamphlet titled &quot;A System of national time and its application&quot; advocating three time zones across the country based on the Washington meridian, modifying this to four zones based on the Greenwich meridian in 1872.

The first proposal for a consistent treatment of time worldwide was a memoir entitled &quot;Terrestrial Time&quot; by Sandford Fleming, at the time the chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, presented to the Canadian Institute in 1876. This envisaged clocks showing 24-hour universal time with an extra dial having a local time rounded to the nearest hour. He also pointed out that many of the corrections for local mean time were greater than those involved in abandoning solar time. In 1878/79, he produced modified proposals using the Greenwich meridian. Fleming&#x27;s two papers were considered so important that in June 1879 the British Government forwarded copies to eighteen foreign countries and to various scientific bodies in England. At the same time the &quot;American Metrological Society&quot; produced a &quot;Report on Standard Time&quot; by Cleveland Abbe, chief of the United States Weather Service proposing essentially the same scheme.

These proposals did not meet universal approval in the scientific community, being opposed by John Rodgers, Superintendent of the Naval Observatory, Washington and British Astronomer Royal, George Airy who had both established wire services supporting local time in various cities. The Naval Observatory had also foiled the onward transmission of the Greenwich time signal from Harvard, where it was received via transatlantic cable and used to time a time ball in Boston. Nevertheless, the United States passed an Act of Congress on authorizing the President to call an international conference to fix on a common prime meridian for time and longitude throughout the world.

The International Meridian Conference had its origins in the Third International Geographical Congress held in Venice in 1881, in which the establishment of a universal prime meridian and a uniform standard of time was high on the agenda. The Seventh International Geodesic Conference in Rome in October1883 then thrashed out most of the technical details, leaving the diplomatic agreements to a later conference. 

On 11 October 1883, a convention of railroad executives met in Chicago and agreed to the implementation of five time zones in North America, using as a basis Greenwich Mean Time. Before the invitations to the Washington conference were sent out on 1December, the joint efforts of Abbe, Fleming and William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the US railways&#x27; &quot;General Time Convention&quot; and Managing Editor of the &quot;Travellers&#x27; Official Guide to the Railways&quot;, had brought the US railway companies to an agreement which led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on across the nation. Thus, a strong sense of &quot;fait accompli&quot; preceded the Washington conference, although setting local times was not part of the remit of the conference and it was not legally established until 1918.

Twenty-six countries, represented by 41 delegates, participated in the conference:

== Resolutions ==

On 22 October 1884, the following resolutions were adopted by the conference (voting took place on 13 October):
Resolution 2, fixing the meridian at Greenwich, was passed 22–1 (San Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, voted against); France and Brazil abstained. The French did not adopt the Greenwich meridian as the beginning of the universal day until 1911. Even then it refused to use the name &quot;Greenwich&quot;, instead using the term &quot;Paris mean time, retarded by 9minutes and 21seconds&quot;. France finally replaced this phrase with &quot;Coordinated Universal Time&quot; (UTC) in 1978. 

Resolution 4 expressly exempts standard time from the universal day. Although two delegates, including Sandford Fleming, proposed the adoption of standard time by all nations, other delegates objected, stating that it was outside the purview of the conference, so neither proposal was subjected to a vote. Thus the conference did &quot;not&quot; adopt any time zones, contrary to popular belief.

Regarding resolution 6: Great Britain had already shifted the beginning of the nautical day from noon, twelve hours before midnight, to midnight in 1805, during the Battle of Trafalgar. The astronomical day was shifted from noon, twelve hours after midnight, to midnight effective by a resolution of the newly formed International Astronomical Union.

On 13 October 1884, the following resolution was not adopted:
Twenty-one countries voted against the proposal, while three (France, Brazil, San Domingo) voted in favor.

From the Act of the Conference the Delegates were:
==Outcomes==

The main issue at the conference, apart from procedural issues such as the provision of an authorized French translation of the proceedings, was France&#x27;s insistence that the meridian should have a strictly neutral character in the same way that they maintained that the metre was a neutral measure. This requirement conflicted with the need to base measurements on an established observatory on land and Fleming&#x27;s proposal of using the anti-meridian of Greenwich was not supported by the British delegation. In the end, the pragmatic argument for continuity with most nautical charts won the day and the French delegation abstained in the vote.

On the question of universal time, Fleming&#x27;s opinion to one of the lead-up committees was borne out: &quot;In my judgment, the nearest approach to it which may be attempted with any chance of success, is to have &quot;first&quot;, a primary standard time, based on the prime meridian that is to be used for non-local purposes; &quot;second&quot;, to have twenty-four secondary standard times to govern local reckoning.&quot; There was discussion of setting zones as small as 10minutes (2½°) (that&#x27;s 10minutes of time, not 10minutes of arc/angular measure), but no motion was tabled, as there was little experience to guide the choice.

Most European countries aligned their clocks with Greenwich within ten years, Sweden and North America already having done so, and the trend continued. The French maintained Paris time till 1911 and the following year convened a second conference to address the differences between different observatories which had become apparent, leading to the establishment of the Bureau International de l&#x27;Heure after World War I.

<text>Gabriel Yared (; born 7 October 1949) is a Lebanese-French composer, best known for his work in French and American cinema.

Born in Beirut, Lebanon, Yared scored the French films &quot;Betty Blue&quot; and &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;. He later worked on English-language films, particularly those directed by Anthony Minghella. He won an Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award for his work on &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996) and was nominated for both &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003).

==Life and career==
When Yared was 7, his father sent him to an accordion teacher. Two years later Yared stopped his accordion lessons and started music theory and piano lessons. Although he was not necessarily a gifted pianist, Yared was interested in reading music. When Yared was 14, his piano teacher died and Yared replaced him as the organist of Université Saint-Joseph. Yared used the university&#x27;s library to read the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Robert Schumann, and many other composers. This extensive reading inspired his first original composition, a piano waltz.

Yared gained a degree in law and did not formally study music at the university level until he traveled to France in 1969 to attend the École Normale de Musique de Paris as a non-registered student. There he learned music composition from Henri Dutilleux.

At the end of 1971, Yared went to Brazil to visit his uncle and was asked by the president of the World Federation of Light Music Festivals to write a song to represent the Lebanese in the Rio de Janeiro Song Festival. The song he composed went on to win first prize. While in Brazil, he also performed with a small orchestra. Yared subsequently said that his time in Brazil greatly influenced his work.

In 1975, he arranged the album &quot;Minacantalucio&quot; for the popular Italian singer Mina.

He then went back to France, where he met and collaborated with the Costa Brothers, Jacques Dutronc, Françoise Hardy, Charles Aznavour, Mireille Mathieu, and numerous other musicians. This was a prolific period for the composer and he wrote nearly 3,000 pieces over a span of about six years. His contributions included a number of radio and TV jingles, such as TF1 news jingles and an episode on the series &quot;In the Tracks of&quot;.

==Film scores==
Yared is best known for his collaborations with the late Anthony Minghella. His first collaboration with Minghella was the 1996 film &quot;The English Patient&quot;, which was highly acclaimed and won him an Oscar for Best Original Score. He composed the scores for all of Minghella&#x27;s subsequent films and the music for the television series &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot;, co-created by Minghella and Richard Curtis.

Aside from his work with Minghella, Yared scored a number of other films, including &quot;Betty Blue&quot; (1986), &quot;Map of the Human Heart&quot; (1992), &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1998), &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (1999), &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; (2000), &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; (2000), &quot;Possession&quot; (2002), and &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; (2003). He had a notable collaboration with René Laloux in the late 1980s on Gandahar and &quot;How Wang-fo was saved&quot; produced at the SEK Studio in North Korea.

Cassandra Clare reported in August 2012 that Yared was tapped to compose the score for &quot;The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones&quot;. However, he was eventually replaced on the project by Atli Örvarsson.

===&quot;Troy&quot; soundtrack===
In 2004, Yared&#x27;s score for the film &quot;Troy&quot; was rejected less than a month before the film&#x27;s opening as a result of the poor reception by a test screening audience. The test audience were said to have found Yared&#x27;s music too &quot;brassy and bold&quot;. James Horner, the composer of the scores for such films as &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; was then hired to create a replacement score in less than four weeks.

Yared expressed his dismay at the score&#x27;s rejection in an open letter which was posted on his website. He said that the score which the test audience had heard was not yet finished and mixed properly, and that the studio had given him no opportunity to alter his score in light of the audience&#x27;s reaction.

Warner Bros. still owns the rights to Yared&#x27;s &quot;Troy&quot; score and an official recording is not currently available and may never be (although selections from the score were briefly posted on Yared&#x27;s website and private promotional CD).

Film score critic Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks.com felt that Yared&#x27;s work for &quot;Troy&quot; was far superior to what Horner had written, giving Horner&#x27;s score a 3-star rating and Yared&#x27;s a 5-star rating, saying that it was &quot;outstanding,&quot; and called it the &quot;pinnacle of Yared&#x27;s career.&quot;

==Ballet scores==
Yared created the score to the narrative ballet &quot;Raven Girl&quot; choreographed to the Royal Ballet by Wayne McGregor after the eponymous story by Audrey Niffenegger.

<text>A player piano is a self-playing piano with a pneumatic or electromechanical mechanism that operates the piano action using perforated paper or metallic rolls. Modern versions use MIDI. The player piano gained popularity as mass-produced home pianos increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Sales peaked in 1924 and subsequently declined with improvements in electrical phonograph recordings in the mid-1920s. The advent of electrical amplification in home music reproduction, brought by radios, contributed to a decline in popularity, and the stock market crash of 1929 virtually wiped out production.

== History==
The first practical pneumatic piano player, manufactured by the Aeolian Company and called the &quot;Pianola&quot;, was invented in 1896 by Edwin S. Votey, and came into widespread use in the 20th century. The name &quot;pianola&quot;, sometimes used as a generic name for any player piano, came from this invention. The mechanism of this player piano was all-pneumatic: foot-operated bellows provided a vacuum to operate a pneumatic motor and drive the take-up spool, while each small inrush of air through a hole in the paper roll was amplified in two stages to sufficient strength to strike a note.

=== 1900–1910 ===

Votey advertised the Pianola widely, making unprecedented use of full-page color advertisements. It was sold initially for $250, and then other, cheaper makes were launched. A standard 65-note format evolved, with rolls and holes spaced 6 to the inch, although several player manufacturers used their own form of roll incompatible with other makes.

By 1903, the Aeolian Company had more than 9,000 roll titles in their catalog, adding 200 titles per month. Many companies&#x27; catalogs ran to thousands of rolls, mainly consisting of light, religious, or classical music. Ragtime music also featured..

Melville Clark introduced two important features to the player piano: the full-scale roll which could play every note on the piano keyboard, and the internal player as standard.

By the end of the decade, the piano player device and the 65-note format became obsolete. This caused problems for many small manufacturers, who had already invested in 65-note player operations, ultimately resulting in rapid consolidation in the industry.

A new, full-scale roll format, playing all 88 notes, was agreed at an industry conference in Buffalo, New York in 1908 at the so-called Buffalo Convention. This kept the 11-inch roll, but now had smaller holes spaced at 9 to the inch. This meant that any player piano could now play any make of roll. This consensus was crucial for avoiding a costly format war, which plagued almost every other form of entertainment medium that followed roll music.

While the player piano matured in America, an inventor in Germany, Edwin Welte, was working on a player which would reproduce all aspects of a performance automatically, so that the machine would play back a recorded performance exactly as if the original pianist were sitting at the piano keyboard. Known as a Reproducing Piano, this device, the Welte-Mignon, was launched in 1904. It created new marketing opportunities, as manufacturers could now get the foremost pianists and composers of the day to record their performances on a piano roll. This allowed owners of player pianos to experience a professional performance in their own homes on their own instruments, exactly as the original pianist had played it.

Aeolian introduced Metrostyle in 1901 and the Themodist in 1904, the Themodist being an invention which was said to bring out the melody clearly above the accompaniment. Sales grew rapidly, and with the instruments now relatively mature, in this decade a wider variety of rolls became available. Two major advances were the introduction of the hand-played roll, both classical and popular, and the word roll.
* Hand-played rolls introduced musical phrasing into the rolls, so that player pianists did not have to introduce it through the use of tempo controls, which few felt inclined to do.
* Word rolls featured printed lyrics in the margins, making it simple to use players to accompany singing in the home, a popular activity before radio and disc recordings became widely available.

The other major advance was the arrival in America of two commercial rivals for the Welte-Mignon Reproducing Piano: the Ampico (from 1911 but fully &#x27;re-enacting&#x27; by 1916) and the Duo-Art (1914). Artrio-Angelus also introduced a reproducing player from 1916. When World War I came in 1914, German patents were seized in the US. In England, Aeolian had a huge factory and sales network and easily outsold the Ampico. Other makers of Reproducing systems, Hupfeld Meisterspiel DEA (1907) and Philipps Duca (c 1909), were successful in Europe. Hupfeld perfected an 88 note reproducing system, the Triphonola, in 1919, and around 5% of players sold were Reproducing Pianos.

In America by the end of the decade, the new &#x27;jazz age&#x27; and the rise of the fox-trot confirmed the player piano as the instrument of popular music, with classical music increasingly relegated to the reproducing piano. Most American roll companies stopped offering large classical catalogs before 1920, and abandoned &#x27;instrumental&#x27; rolls (those without words) within a few years.

In England, the Aeolian Company continued to sell classical material, and customers remained willing to contribute to performances by following directions printed on the rolls and operate the hand and foot controls themselves. Sydney Grew, in his manual &quot;The Art of the Piano Player&quot;, published in London in 1922, said that &quot;it takes about three years to make a good player-pianist of a man or woman of average musical intelligence. It takes about seven years to make a good pianist, or organist, or singer&quot;. Word rolls never became popular in England, as they cost 20% more than non-word rolls. As a result, post-World War I American and British roll collections looked very different.

=== 1950–present ===
In the early 1950s, player pianos and other instruments of the 1920s and earlier became collectable. An enthusiast, Frank Holland, who had collected player pianos while working in Canada, returned to England and held meetings of like-minded enthusiasts at his house in London. In 1959 this gathering was formalized as &#x27;The Player Piano Group&#x27;, and in the early 1960s Holland founded the British Piano Museum (now the Musical Museum) in Brentford.

In America, another collector, Harvey Roehl, published a book called &quot;Player Piano Treasury&quot; in 1961. This sold in large numbers and was followed by books published by Roehl&#x27;s Vestal Press on how to rebuild and restore the instruments. Other societies were formed worldwide to preserve and study all aspects of mechanical music, among them the Musical Box Society International (MBSI) and the Automatic Musical Instruments Collector&#x27;s Association (AMICA) in the USA. 

The revival of interest in player pianos in the 1960s led to renewed production. Aeolian revived the Pianola, this time in a small spinet piano suited to post-war housing, and other manufacturers followed. QRS offered a traditional player piano in its Story and Clark piano. Early enthusiasts could often get by with limited patching and repairs, although original 1920s instruments could still be found in working order. Complete rebuilding of old instruments to original condition became possible.

== Types ==

A player piano is a piano that contains a manually controlled, pneumatically operated piano player mechanism. The operator manipulates control levers to produce a musical performance. Various aids were developed:

; Split stack control: In these instruments (the vast majority of all player pianos) the pneumatic player mechanism is divided into two approximately equal halves. The operator can lower the volume of either half of the keyboard independently of the other.
; Theme control: These instruments have peripheral pneumatic hardware systems which, when used in conjunction with special music rolls, are able to highlight notes in the score which are intended to be emphasised while others are made quieter. Basic theme pianos subdue all notes and release full power to only those notes which are aligned with certain music roll &quot;theme&quot; perforations. Subtler systems (such as Hupfeld&#x27;s &quot;Solodant&quot; and Aeolian&#x27;s &quot;Themodist&quot;) have a graduated theme control, in which the background subdued level and the foreground melody level are both controllable. The nature of the mechanism is such that where a chord occurs, notes to be emphasised have to be advanced slightly away from their neighbours in order for the mechanism to identify them.
; Isolated theme: The hardware of these pianos is able to pick out the melody notes from the background accompaniment within the entire range of the keyboard, without the need to break up chords. Manufacturers of these systems were the UK &quot;Dalian&quot; and &quot;Kastonome&quot; and the US &quot;Solo Carola&quot;.
; Expression player : The hardware of these pianos is able to generate a broad general musical dynamic from roll coding. The pneumatic stack operates at fixed, pre-set tension depending on the coding, giving an effect of musical dynamics. Examples of this system are &quot;Recordo&quot; and &quot;Empeco&quot;
; Reproducing pianos: These are fully automated versions of the player piano, requiring no human control to produce the effect of a live musical performance. This is achieved with music rolls in which tempo mapping is incorporated into the rolls and the note lengths of a live performance have been captured. The volume dynamics are created by peripheral accessories controlled by the music roll coding, which removes the need to operate control levers. An electric motor provides power. Most reproducing pianos are capable of being played manually, and many are constructed for dual function. Numerous companies made these, and the first successful instrument was the &quot;Mignon&quot;, launched by Welte in 1904.

== Music rolls ==

Music rolls for pneumatic player pianos, often known as piano rolls, consist of a continuous sheet of paper rolled on to a spool. The spool fits into the player piano spool box whereupon the free end of the music sheet is hooked onto the take-up spool which will unwind the roll at an even pace across the reading mechanism (the &quot;tracker bar&quot;) The music score to be played is programmed onto the paper by means of perforations. Different player systems have different perforation sizes, channel layouts and spool fittings though the majority conform to one or two predominant formats latterly adopted as the industry standard.

Music is programmed via a number of methods.
# the music is marked out on master stencil on a purely metronomic basis direct from the printed sheet music with the player-pianists being left to create their own music performance
# the music stencil is created metronomically via a piano-keyboard operated punch machine
# a live performance is played onto a special piano connected to an electronically operated marking mechanism, and a physical stencil is produced from this live output, either as-is or after some general regularisation of tempo where necessary
# modern computer software and MIDI software can be used to create piano roll stencils for operating modern-day perforating machines and create new titles.

The player piano sold globally in its heyday, and music rolls were manufactured extensively in the US, as well as most European countries, South America, Australia and New Zealand. A large number of titles from all manufacturers survive to this day, and rolls still turn up regularly in large quantities.

It was reported that the last remaining mass producer of piano rolls in the world, QRS Music, temporarily halted production of the rolls on December 31, 2008.
However, QRS Music still list themselves as the only roll manufacturer remaining, and claim to have 45,000 titles available with &quot;new titles being added on a regular basis&quot;.

The Musical Museum in Brentford, London, England, houses a nationally significant collection of piano rolls, with over 20,000 rolls, as well as an extensive collection of instruments which may be seen and heard.

== Modern implementations ==

Later developments of the reproducing piano include the use of magnetic tape and floppy disks, rather than piano rolls, to record and play back the music; and, in the case of one instrument made by Bösendorfer, computer assisted playback.

In 1982, Yamaha Corporation introduced the &quot;Piano Player&quot;, which was the first mass-produced, commercially available reproducing piano that was capable of digitally capturing and reproducing a piano performance using floppy disk as a storage medium. The Piano Player was replaced in 1987 by the Yamaha Disklavier and since 1998, the Disklavier PRO models are capable of capturing and reproducing &quot;high-resolution&quot; piano performances of up to 1024 velocity levels and 256 increments of positional pedaling using Yamaha&#x27;s proprietary XP (Extended Precision) MIDI specification.

Almost all modern player pianos use MIDI to interface with computer equipment. Most modern player pianos come with an electronic device that can record and playback MIDI files on floppy disks and/or CD-ROMs, and a MIDI interface that enables computers to drive the piano directly for more advanced operations. The MIDI files can trigger solenoids, which use electric current to drive small mechanical plungers mounted to the key action inside the piano. Live performance or computer generated music can be recorded in MIDI file format for accurate reproduction later on such instruments. MIDI files containing converted antique piano-rolls can be purchased on the Internet.

, several player piano conversion kits are available (PianoDisc, PNOmation, etc.), allowing the owners of normal pianos to convert them into computer controlled instruments. The conversion process usually involves cutting open the bottom of the piano to install mechanical parts under the keyboard, although one organization—Logos Foundation—has manufactured a portable, external kit. A new player piano conversion kit was introduced in 2007-08 by Wayne Stahnke, the inventor of the Bösendorfer SE reproducing system, called the &quot;LX&quot;.

 Steinway manufactures a player piano based on Wayne Stahnke&#x27;s Live Performance LX system, which was sold to Steinway in 2014 and re-branded as Spirio. Unlike other piano brands, a recording option was not originally available, but in 2019 Steinway introduced Spirio | r models, which can also record.

Edelweiss is a British music upcomer on the player piano market offering totally bespoke pianos, available in luxury department store Harrods since 2017 and according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; YouTube channel &#x27;How to Spend it&#x27;, Edelweiss is &quot;regarded as the most upmarket of today&#x27;s breed of the self-playing piano&quot;.

== Comparison to electric pianos ==
A player piano is not an electric piano, electronic piano, or a digital piano. The distinction between these instruments lies in the way sounds are produced. A player piano is an acoustic piano where the sound is produced by hammer strikes on the piano strings. Electrical components in post-pneumatic versions are limited to moving the keys or hammers mimicking the actions of a person; sound is not generated or amplified electronically.

<text>The Oggy Oggy Oggy chant (alternatively spelt Oggie Oggie Oggie or Ogi Ogi Ogi), and its variations, are often heard at sporting events, political rallies and around numerous Scout and Guide campfires, primarily in Britain and some Commonwealth nations. One group will shout Oggy three times, while another will respond with Oi! three times.

The phrase may be of Cornish origin, possibly deriving from the Cornish language (a pasty is known in Devon and Cornwall as an Oggie, possibly deriving from &quot;hoggan&quot; - a Cornish word). The chant appeared in British sports grounds in the 1960s and 1970s, namely rugby union and football. Plymouth Argyle supporters have long used this as a chant. Welsh singer and comedian Max Boyce later popularised its use in Rugby Union, while in association football a popular variation was the “Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy” chant by Chelsea fans in homage to their star striker Peter Osgood. When Margaret Thatcher became British Prime Minister in 1979 a variation of the chant, &quot;Maggie Maggie Maggie, Out Out Out!&quot;, was adopted by some of her opponents.

==Form==
The usual form of the chant consists of two groups, one shouting the word &quot;Oggy!&quot; and the other group shouting the word &quot;Oi!&quot; Often a single individual will shout &quot;Oggy&quot; and everyone else will shout the reply, &quot;Oi!&quot;. The words are shouted according to the following pattern.

==Origins==

&quot;Oggy&quot; is a slang term for a Cornish pasty derived from its Cornish language name, &quot;hogen&quot;, and was used by local Cornish sailors throughout Cornwall as well as at the Devonport Dockyard in reference to pasty sellers who stand outside the gates. The chant formed the traditional end to the Tiddy Oggy Song, the unofficial anthem of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and The Devonport marines are still associated with the song Oggie Man by Cyril Tawney which they generally sing at public displays.

Tin-miners&#x27; wives or pasty sellers supposedly shouted &quot;Oggy Oggy Oggy&quot; – the response from any hungry miner or labourer would be &quot;Oi!, Oi!, Oi!.&quot; The chant is also the chorus of a folk song and has always been heard at Cornish rugby matches so this seem another possible origin.

The Oxford English Dictionary (2004) entry for &quot;Oggy&quot; states: &quot;Oggy, &quot;noun&quot;. &quot;West Country regional&quot; (orig. &quot;Cornwall&quot;) and &quot;Navy&quot; slang. A Cornish pasty. Probably an alteration of Cornish &quot;hoggan&quot; pastry, pie (18th century), perhaps cognate with Welsh &quot;chwiogen&quot; muffin, simnel cake (1562), of unknown origin.&quot;

Members of the Royal Navy claim to have used the chant, or a version of it, since the Second World War.
The &#x27;Oggie, Oggie, Oggie&#x27; chant was used by supporters of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Devonport Field Gun Team and by members of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment. (The field gun competition was discontinued in 1999 after a hundred years of competition and the infantry regiment folded into The Rifles in 2007).

It was then adopted at a few British football grounds at some point during the postwar period, and was certainly in common use by the 1960s most notably at Home Park amongst the supporters of Plymouth Argyle.

In the 1970s the Welsh folk singer and comedian Max Boyce popularised the chant to excite the crowd at his concerts. Boyce is also a big rugby union fan, and through him it then began to be adopted by Welsh rugby union crowds at international matches. Soon it spread to rugby crowds at club and international level. In a patriotic outburst during her BAFTA Award acceptance speech in 2003 Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones shouted the chant.

The chant was also used by Coventry City football fans during the 1980s and 1990s in appreciation to then goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic who had been nicknamed &#x27;Oggy&#x27;.

It is also often used at sideshows on rides such as the Heartbreaker and the Waltzers, where the rides controller says &quot;oggie, oggie, oggie&quot; and the people on the ride shout &#x27;oi, oi, oi&quot; to get the ride to speed up or get more spins etc.

==Use within scouting and guiding==

Oggy Oggy Oggy has long been a major chant within Scouting and Guiding, especially within the UK. &quot;An Oggy&quot; as it is termed within Troops and Units is usually used at Scouting events and as a way of expressing thanks to those within and outside Scouting.

==Variations==

Several variations of the &quot;Oggy&quot; chant have arisen as its cultural significance and recognition has grown. In the mid-1960s Hull City A.F.C. fans adapted it to &quot;Waggy,&quot; to cheer for Ken Wagstaff and in the 1970s, Chelsea F.C. football fans changed it to &quot;Ozzie,&quot; in honour of Peter Osgood, the footballer and speedway fans in the 70s and early 80s would chant &quot;Ollie Ollie Ollie&quot; to cheer on Danish rider Ole Olsen. When Margaret Thatcher came to power in Britain in 1979 a variation of the chant (&quot;Maggie Maggie Maggie, Out Out Out!&quot;) was adopted by some of her opponents.

The &quot;Oggy&quot; chant was quite popular in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the matches of North American Soccer League version of the Vancouver Whitecaps.

Another variation is the &quot;Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi&quot; chant. It had been heard at Australian sporting events as early as 1987. The chant had found widespread popularity by the time of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.

At Arizona Diamondbacks games during the 2008–09 seasons, fans would shout &quot;Augie Augie Augie, Oi Oi Oi&quot; in reference to utility infielder Augie Ojeda. (In many dialects of American English, &quot;Augie&quot; and &quot;Oggy&quot; are homophones).

At Seattle Storm WNBA basketball games, when Ezi Magbegor scores, the announcer chants, &quot;Ezi, Ezi, Ezi,&quot; to which the fans repspond, &quot;Oi, Oi, Oi!&quot;

The chant has been adopted by the fans of English rugby union premiership side Wasps changing &quot;Oggy&quot; to &quot;Allez&quot; and &quot;Oi&quot; to &quot;Wasps&quot; and the Exeter Chiefs. replacing the word &quot;Oi&quot; with the word &quot;Chiefs&quot;.

The chant was also popular in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where a variation had fans of the Calgary Flames shout &quot;Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, Oi Oi Oi&quot; when Jarome Iginla fought or scored in a game. This was especially popular during his 50-goal season in the 2007–08 NHL season.

In Sweden, a popular version of the chant is &quot;&quot;Bira Bira Bira, Bärs Bärs Bärs&quot;. Both words are slang for beer. It is used mostly among students and young people.

In France, there is another version: &quot;Atchik Atchik Atchik, Aie Aie Aie&quot;&quot;. It&#x27;s usually played in football match. This &quot;Tchik-atchik-atchik-aï-aï-aï&quot; is reminiscent of the song &quot;La Belle de Cadix&quot; by Francis Lopez.

The chant appeared with only the Oggies audible in the first episode of the second series of &quot;The Office&quot;, as a result of a conversation with the Oggmonster.

<text>In chemistry, diamondoids are generalizations of the carbon cage molecule known as adamantane (C10H16), the smallest unit cage structure of the diamond crystal lattice. Diamondoids also known as nanodiamonds or condensed adamantanes may include one or more cages (adamantane, diamantane, triamantane, and higher polymantanes) as well as numerous isomeric and structural variants of adamantanes and polymantanes. These diamondoids occur naturally in petroleum deposits and have been extracted and purified into large pure crystals of polymantane molecules having more than a dozen adamantane cages per molecule. These species are of interest as molecular approximations of the diamond cubic framework, terminated with C−H bonds.

==Examples==


Examples include:
* Adamantane (C10H16)
* Iceane (C12H18)
* BC-8 (C14H20)
* Diamantane (C14H20) also &quot;diadamantane&quot;, two face-fused cages
* Triamantane (C18H24), also &quot;triadamantane&quot;. Diamantane has four identical faces available for anchoring a new C4H4 unit.
* Isotetramantane (C22H28). Triamantane has eight faces on to which a new C4H4 unit can be added resulting in four isomers. One of these isomers displays a helical twist and is therefore prochiral. The &quot;P&quot; and &quot;M&quot; enantiomers have been separated.
* Pentamantane has nine isomers with chemical formula C26H32 and one more pentamantane exists with chemical formula C25H30
* Cyclohexamantane (C26H30)

* Super-adamantane (C30H36)

One tetramantane isomer is the largest ever diamondoid prepared by organic synthesis using a keto-carbenoid reaction to attach cyclopentane rings. Longer diamondoids have been formed from diamantane dicarboxylic acid. The first-ever isolation of a wide range of diamondoids from petroleum took place in the following steps: a vacuum distillation above 345 °C, the equivalent atmospheric boiling point, then pyrolysis at 400 to 450 °C in order to remove all non-diamondoid compounds (diamondoids are thermodynamically very stable and will survive this pyrolysis) and then a series of high-performance liquid chromatography separation techniques.

In one study a tetramantane compound is fitted with thiol groups at the bridgehead positions. This allows their anchorage to a gold surface and formation of self-assembled monolayers (diamond-on-gold).

Organic chemistry of diamondoids even extends to &quot;pentamantane&quot;. The medial position (base) in this molecule (the isomer [1(2,3)4]pentamantane) is calculated to yield a more favorable carbocation than the apical position (top) and simple bromination of pentamantane &quot;1&quot; with bromine exclusively gives the medial bromo derivative &quot;2&quot; which on hydrolysis in water and DMF forms the alcohol &quot;3&quot;.

In contrast nitrooxylation of &quot;1&quot; with nitric acid gives the apical nitrate &quot;4&quot; as an intermediate which is hydrolysed to the apical alcohol &quot;5&quot; due to the higher steric demand of the active electrophilic species. This alcohol can react with thionyl bromide to the bromide &quot;6&quot; and in a series of steps (not shown) to the corresponding thiol. Pentamantane can also react with tetrabromomethane and tetra-&quot;n&quot;-butylammonium bromide (TBABr) in a free radical reaction to the bromide but without selectivity.

== Origin and occurrence ==

Diamondoids are found in mature high-temperature petroleum fluids (volatile oils, condensates and wet gases). These fluids can have up to a spoonful of diamondoids per US gallon (3.78 liters). A review by Mello and Moldowan in 2005 showed that although the carbon in diamonds is not biological in origin, the diamondoids found in petroleum are composed of carbon from biological sources. This was determined by comparing the ratios of carbon isotopes present.

== Optical and electronic properties ==

The optical absorption for all diamondoids lies deep in the ultraviolet spectral region with optical band gaps around 6 electronvolts and higher. The spectrum of each diamondoid is found to reflect its individual size, shape and symmetry. Due to their well-defined size and structure diamondoids also serve as a model system for electronic structure calculations.

Many of the optoelectronic properties of diamondoids are determined by the difference in the nature of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals: the former is a bulk state, whereas the latter is a surface state. As a result, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is roughly independent of the size of the diamondoid.

Diamondoids have been found to exhibit a negative electron affinity, making them potentially useful in electron-emission devices.

<doc id="146021" wikidata="Q208767" url="?curid=146021" title="The Stooges">
<text>The Stooges, originally billed as the Psychedelic Stooges, and also known as Iggy and the Stooges, were an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1967 by singer Iggy Pop, guitarist Ron Asheton, drummer Scott Asheton, and bassist Dave Alexander. Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Iggy Pop.

After releasing two albums – &quot;The Stooges&quot; (1969) and &quot;Fun House&quot; (1970) – the group disbanded briefly, and reformed with an altered lineup (with Ron Asheton replacing Dave Alexander on bass and James Williamson taking up guitar) to release a third album, &quot;Raw Power&quot; (1973), before breaking up again in 1974. The band reunited in 2003 with Ron Asheton moving back to guitar and Mike Watt on bass, and the addition of saxophonist Steve Mackay, who had played saxophone on &quot;Fun House&quot;. Ron Asheton died in 2009 and was replaced by James Williamson, and the band continued to play shows until 2013, when they also released their last album, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;. The Stooges formally announced their breakup in 2016 due to the deaths of Scott Asheton and saxophonist Steve Mackay.

The Stooges are widely regarded as a seminal proto-punk act. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them 78th on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. In 2007, they were awarded the Mojo Lifetime Achievement Award at the Mojo Awards.

==History==
===Formation (1967–1968)===
Iggy Pop (born James Newell Osterberg) played drums in several Ann Arbor–area bands as a teenager, including the Iguanas and, later, the Prime Movers. The Prime Movers nicknamed Osterberg &quot;Iggy&quot; in reference to his earlier band.

Osterberg was first inspired to form the Stooges after meeting blues drummer Sam Lay during a visit to Chicago. Upon returning to Detroit, Osterberg sought to create a new form of blues music that was not derivative of historical precedents, with influence from garage rock bands The Sonics and The Kinks. Ron Asheton (guitar) and Scott Asheton (drums), and Dave Alexander (bass guitar) comprised the rest of the band, with Osterberg as the main singer. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in a cover band called the Chosen Few, believing, &quot;I&#x27;ve never met a convincing musician that didn&#x27;t look kind of ill and kind of dirty, and Ron had those two things covered!&quot; The three nicknamed Osterberg &quot;Pop&quot; after a local character whom he resembled. Shortly after witnessing an MC5 concert in Ann Arbor, Osterberg began using the stage name Iggy Pop, a name that he has used ever since.

Though the Stooges had formed, Iggy Pop attributes two key motivating influences to move the band forward. The first was seeing the Doors perform at a homecoming dance for the University of Michigan. The second was seeing an all-girls rock band from Princeton, New Jersey, called the Untouchable perform in the summer of 1967. In a 1995 interview with &quot;Bust Magazine&quot;, he relates:

The band&#x27;s 1967 debut was at their communal State Street house on Halloween night, followed by their next live gig in January 1968. During this early period, the Stooges were originally billed as the &quot;Psychedelic Stooges&quot; at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, Michigan, and other venues, where they played with the band MC5 and others. At one of their early Grande Ballroom performances, Asheton&#x27;s guitar neck separated from the body forcing the band to stop playing during the opening song, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;. The first major commercial show for the Psychedelic Stooges was on March 3, 1968, at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, opening for Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. According to John Sinclair, who booked the show, the Psychedelic Stooges were substitutes for the MC5, who had a formidable Detroit reputation that made Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears reluctant to follow them. A fan who saw several of their performances at that time said, &quot;What they achieved was an almost orchestral drone or trance-like sound which was totally unique, valid and impressive.&quot;

The group&#x27;s early sound differed from their later music, wrote critic Edwin Pouncey:

===First two albums and first breakup (1968–1971)===
The Stooges soon gained a reputation for their wild, primitive live performances. Pop, especially, became known for his outrageous onstage behavior: smearing his bare chest with hamburger meat and peanut butter, cutting himself with shards of glass, and flashing his genitalia to the audience. Pop is sometimes credited with the invention or popularization of stage diving.

In 1968, Elektra Records sent DJ/publicist Danny Fields to scout the MC5, resulting in contracts for both that band and the Stooges. The contracts were at different pay rates: MC5 $20,000, the Stooges $5,000, as revealed in the 2016 Jim Jarmusch film, &quot;Gimme Danger&quot;. In 1969, the band released their self-titled debut album; sales were low and it was not well received by critics at the time.

In 1970, their second album, &quot;Fun House&quot;, was released, featuring the addition of saxophonist Steve Mackay. On June 13 of that year, television recorded the band at the Cincinnati Pop Festival. While performing the songs &quot;T.V. Eye&quot; and &quot;1970&quot;, Pop leaped into the crowd, where he was hoisted up on people&#x27;s hands, and proceeded to smear peanut butter all over his chest. In a broadcast interview at WNUR Northwestern University radio station in Evanston, Illinois, in 1984, Stiv Bators of the Lords of the New Church and the Dead Boys confirmed the long-standing rumor that it was he who had provided the peanut butter, having carried a large tub from his home in Youngstown, Ohio, and handing it up to Iggy from the audience.

&quot;Fun House&quot; was also poorly received by critics and the general public. Alexander was dismissed in August 1970 after arriving at the Goose Lake International Music Festival too drunk to play. He was replaced by a succession of new bass players, including former roadie Zeke Zettner and James Recca. Around this time, the band expanded their lineup by adding a second guitar player, roadie Bill Cheatham, who was eventually replaced by James Williamson, a childhood friend of the Ashetons and Alexander.

By this time, the Stooges, with the notable exception of Ron Asheton, had all become serious heroin users. The drug was introduced to the band by new manager John Adams. Their performances became even more unpredictable, and Pop often had trouble standing up on stage due to his extreme drug abuse. Elektra soon eliminated the Stooges from its roster, and the band had a hiatus for several months. The final lineup was Pop, the Asheton brothers, Recca and Williamson.

The breakup of the Stooges was formally announced on July 9, 1971.

===&quot;Raw Power&quot; and second breakup (1972–1974)===
With the band having broken up, Pop met David Bowie on September 7, 1971, at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, and the pair quickly became good friends. The next day, on the advice of Bowie, Pop signed a recording contract with pop music manager Tony DeFries&#x27; company, MainMan. A few months later, Tony DeFries and Pop met Clive Davis from CBS/Columbia Records and got a two-album recording deal. In March 1972, DeFries brought Pop and Williamson to the UK, and the pair attempted to reconstitute the Stooges with British musicians, but after finding no suitable additions, they brought the Asheton brothers back into the band. (This &quot;second choice&quot; decision rankled Ron Asheton, as did his change from guitar to bass.) This lineup, billed as Iggy &amp; the Stooges, recorded their third album, the influential &quot;Raw Power&quot;, which was released in 1973.

At the time, the album faced the criticism that Bowie had mixed it poorly. (In subsequent years, various unofficial fan recordings were assembled and released as the album &quot;Rough Power;&quot; in 1997, the album was re-mixed by Iggy Pop and re-released.) Although the album sold rather poorly and was regarded as a commercial failure at the time of its release, &quot;Raw Power&quot; would go on to gain recognition from early punk rockers.

With the addition of a piano player (briefly Bob Sheff and then Scott Thurston), the Stooges toured for several months, starting in February 1973. Around this time they also made a number of recordings that became known as the &quot;Detroit Rehearsal Tapes&quot;, including a number of new songs that might have been included on a fourth studio album, had the band not been dropped by Columbia soon after the release of &quot;Raw Power&quot;. In 1973, James Williamson was briefly dismissed due to criticism from the band&#x27;s management company (likely pertaining to his tempestuous relationship with Cyrinda Foxe, a close friend of road manager Leee Black Childers); guitarist Tornado Turner replaced him for a single gig (on June 15, 1973, at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago), but Williamson soon returned to the group.

The Stooges disbanded in February 1974 as a result of dwindling professional opportunities; this factor was compounded by Pop&#x27;s ever-present heroin addiction and erratic off-stage behavior. The last half of the band&#x27;s last performance of this era on February 9, 1974, in Detroit, Michigan, was captured and was released in 1976 as the live album &quot;Metallic K.O.&quot;, along with the first half of an earlier show on October 6, 1973, at the same venue. A 1988 expanded release of the album with the title &quot;Metallic 2X K.O.&quot; included the two halves of each show. In 1998, the album was re-released under the original title with the order of the shows reversed, (mostly) expanded tracks and more complete set lists.

===Post-breakup (1975–2003)===

After his first attempt at drug rehabilitation, Pop began a volatile yet ultimately successful solo career in 1977, commencing with the Bowie-produced albums &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1977) and &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1977). Relocated to Los Angeles, California, Ron Asheton formed the short-lived band the New Order (not to be confused with the UK band New Order) with Stooges alumni Recca and Thurston before performing with the Ann Arbor–based &quot;anti-rock&quot; group Destroy All Monsters from 1977 to 1985. Until the Stooges&#x27; reformation, he supported himself as a working musician in various ensembles, including New Race, Dark Carnival and the Empty Set. Williamson worked with Pop as a producer and engineer during his early solo career – the &quot;Kill City&quot; and &quot;New Values&quot; albums are a product of this collaboration – but began a long break from the music industry in favor of a career in electronics engineering beginning in 1980. He received his degree from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona in 1982 and retired from Sony as vice president of technical standards in 2009. Scott Asheton performed with Sonic&#x27;s Rendezvous Band and the Scott Morgan Group while pursuing various day jobs. Dave Alexander died of pulmonary edema related to his alcohol-induced pancreatitis in 1975.

In 1997, a reissue of &quot;Raw Power&quot; remixed by Pop was released. In 1999, reissue label Rhino Handmade released the seven-disc box set &quot;1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions&quot;, composed of the entire recording sessions associated with the &quot;Fun House&quot; album. 3,000 copies were pressed, selling out in less than a year.

In 2000, indie rock music veterans J Mascis (of Dinosaur Jr) and Mike Watt (of the Minutemen and Firehose) teamed up with Ron Asheton and drummer George Berz to perform Stooges covers (and other material) live. Billed as J. Mascis and the Fog, the band performed sporadically before Pop became aware of them in 2003.

===Reunion and Ron Asheton&#x27;s death (2003–2009)===
Pop and the Ashetons first reunited that year, sharing four songs on the &quot;Skull Ring&quot; album with Pop on vocals, Scott Asheton on drums, and Ron Asheton on both guitar and bass. Soon afterward, the Stooges reunited officially, performing a series of live shows in the United States and Europe, with Watt on bass at Ron Asheton&#x27;s request, and &quot;Fun House–&quot;era saxophonist Steve Mackay. Their Detroit homecoming show, postponed by the 2003 North America blackout, was released as the DVD &quot;Live in Detroit&quot;.

On August 16, 2005, Elektra Records and Rhino Records issued newly remastered two-CD editions of the first two Stooges albums, featuring the original album on disc one and outtakes (including alternate mixes, single versions, etc.) on disc two. Unlike the 1997 &quot;Raw Power&quot; reissue, which was a total remix from the original multitracks, these remasters are faithful to the original mixes.
In 2007, the band released an album of all-new material, &quot;The Weirdness&quot;, with Steve Albini recording, and mastering done at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. The album received mixed to negative reviews from the press. The band also contributed a cover of Junior Kimbrough&#x27;s &quot;You Better Run&quot; to a tribute album for the late blues artist.

The Stooges were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2008.

The Stooges spent the years between 2003 and 2008 touring extensively, playing shows on five different continents. Highlights included performances at several events involved with the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties concert series, Pop&#x27;s 60th birthday on the stage of San Francisco&#x27;s Warfield Theater, touring with the Lollapalooza festival, and a performance of two Madonna covers at the Michigan-born singer&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in protest of the Stooges&#x27; failure to receive an induction into said institution despite six nominations. (Two years later, the band was successfully inducted.) A low of this touring era occurred in August 2008 when the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen in Montreal, Quebec. Initially, the reunited band&#x27;s sets consisted solely of material from &quot;The Stooges&quot;, &quot;Fun House&quot;, &quot;Skull Ring&quot; and &quot;The Weirdness&quot;. By 2008, they had added &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;, &quot;I Got a Right&quot; and &quot;Raw Power&quot; to its set lists. The band&#x27;s final show with Ron Asheton was on September 29, 2008, in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

On January 6, 2009, Ron Asheton was found dead in his home, having reportedly suffered a heart attack several days earlier. He was 60 years old. In their official statement, the group called Asheton &quot;irreplaceable&quot;.

On October 1, 2009, &quot;The Stooges: The Authorized and Illustrated Story&quot; by Robert Matheu and Jeffrey Morgan (authorized biographer of Alice Cooper) was published in hardcover by Abrams.

===Return of James Williamson and final breakup (2009–2016)===

In a May 2009 interview, Pop announced the band&#x27;s plans to continue performing with James Williamson returning as guitarist. Pop stated that &quot;although &#x27;the Stooges&#x27; died with Ron Asheton, there was still &#x27;Iggy and the Stooges&#x27;&quot;. Their first concert occurred on November 7, 2009, in São Paulo, Brazil. The band added material from &quot;Raw Power&quot; and several of Pop&#x27;s early solo albums to its repertoire.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the band in its Class of 2010. The band had previously been nominated for election seven times, each unsuccessful. Their performance for the event included a guest appearance by former keyboardist Scott Thurston. Performances with Williamson continued, including the 2010 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Monticello, New York, where they performed &quot;Raw Power&quot; in its entirety. A re-release of &quot;Raw Power&quot; was released on April 10, 2010, including the first remastering of the David Bowie mix and a live 1973 performance. The following year, Detroit author Brett Callwood published &quot;The Stooges – Head On: A Journey Through The Michigan Underground&quot;, a book that focuses heavily on the Asheton brothers&#x27; activities after the initial decline of the Stooges.

On February 25, 2013, the band released what would become their last album, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;. The album was released on April 30 on Fat Possum. Iggy and the Stooges played the final date of their 25-city 2013 world tour with a performance at the C2SV Festival in San Jose on September 28, 2013.

On March 15, 2014, Scott Asheton died of a heart attack, aged 64. Saxophonist Steve Mackay died in October 2015 at the age of 66.

In 2016, Jim Jarmusch directed &quot;Gimme Danger&quot;, a documentary film about the band.

On June 22, 2016, guitarist Williamson made an official statement for the band saying that the Stooges are no more: &quot;The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody&#x27;s dead except Iggy and I. So it would be sort of ludicrous to try and tour as Iggy and the Stooges when there&#x27;s only one Stooge in the band and then you have side guys. That doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.&quot; Williamson also expressed a desire to stop touring.

==Musical style==
The Stooges are widely regarded as a seminal proto-punk act and as instrumental in the development of punk rock, alternative rock, heavy metal and rock music at large. In the years before noise rock was named as a musical genre, the Stooges were combining noise with punk rock in the same vein.

==Legacy==
Music journalist Lester Bangs was one of the first writers to champion the Stooges in a national publication. His piece &quot;Of Pop and Pies and Fun&quot; for &quot;Creem Magazine&quot; was published about the time of the Stooges&#x27; second album, &quot;Fun House&quot;. Another music journalist, Legs McNeil, was especially fond of Iggy and the Stooges and championed them in many of his writings.

Former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took, interviewed by Charles Shaar Murray for the NME in 1972, cited Pop&#x27;s stage act as an inspiration for his own chaotic onstage behavior during the band&#x27;s late 1969 US tour (after which he was replaced by Mickey Finn).

The Stooges&#x27; brand of rabid proto-punk laid the foundation for countless punk rock bands over the decades. The Sex Pistols recorded the first high-profile Stooges cover, &quot;No Fun&quot;, in 1976. Sid Vicious also regularly performed &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and &quot;Shake Appeal (Tight Pants)&quot; in his post-Pistols solo shows, and included both on his &quot;Sid Sings&quot; album. According to Dee Dee Ramone, the members of the Ramones felt alienated from their community growing up and started hanging out with each other due to a common love of Stooges, a band everyone else they knew greatly disliked. A typical social experience was listening to the Stooges together while miming/imitating a performance by Iggy Pop. Joey Ramone&#x27;s cover of the song &quot;1969&quot; appeared on his posthumous debut solo album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot;. The Stooges were also a key early influence on Siouxsie and the Banshees frontwoman Siouxsie Sioux.

Several punk bands took their names from Stooges songs or lyrics, including Radio Birdman, Penetration, Raw Power, Shake Appeal and The Streetwalkin&#x27; Cheetahs. Australian band Radio Birdman which included fellow Ann Arbor native Deniz Tek, named an early venue &quot;The Oxford Funhouse&quot;, while on their 1977 album &quot;Radios Appear&quot;, they covered the Stooges song &quot;TV Eye&quot; and name-checked the Stooges in the Deniz Tek song &quot;Do the Pop&quot;. The band&#x27;s name was itself taken, although incorrectly, from the lyrics of the Stooges song &quot;1970&quot;.

Numerous other bands and artists spanning multiple genres have cited the Stooges as an influence, including Misfits, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. frontman J Mascis, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Mudhoney, Ride, Pere Ubu, and Crime.

Kurt Cobain consistently listed &quot;Raw Power&quot; as his favorite album of all time in the &quot;Favorite Albums&quot; lists that featured in his &quot;Journals&quot;.

Joan Jett covered &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; for her platinum 1988 album, Up Your Alley. The first album by British punk band the Damned, &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot;, concluded with &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;, a cover of the Stooges&#x27; &quot;1970&quot; under its accepted alternate title. In 1982, the Birthday Party released &quot;Drunk on the Pope&#x27;s Blood&quot;, a live EP with a version of &quot;Loose&quot;. On multiple occasions, the Birthday Party performed entire sets of Stooges covers. Their live version of &quot;Fun House&quot; can be found on their live album, &quot;Live 1981–82.&quot; Sonic Youth covered &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; on 1983&#x27;s &quot;Confusion Is Sex&quot;. English space rock group Spacemen 3 covered &quot;Little Doll&quot; on their 1986 album &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot;. Uncle Tupelo covered &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, although they did not release it while they were active. In 1993, Guns N&#x27; Roses covered the song &quot;Raw Power&quot; on their album &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; The Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded a cover of &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; during the sessions for &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;; the song appeared on the B-side of the &quot;Give It Away&quot; single, and later on the Iggy Pop tribute album &quot;We Will Fall&quot;, the compilation albums &quot;Under the Covers&quot; and &quot;The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience&quot;, and the compilation EP &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Covers EP&quot;. They also played &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; live. Soundgarden covered &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; on their live album &quot;Live on I-5&quot;. Thrash metal band Slayer cover &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; on their 1996 cover album &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot; (naming it &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Your God&quot;). Rage Against the Machine covered the song &quot;Down on the Street&quot; on their 2000 album, &quot;Renegades.&quot; In 2007, R.E.M. performed &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; with Patti Smith in their induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In August 1995, all three Stooges albums were included in British music magazine &quot;Mojo&#x27;s&quot; influential &quot;100 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; feature. &quot;Fun House&quot; was placed the highest, at 16.

The Stooges&#x27; &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; was featured in Harmonix&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; for the PlayStation 2.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Stooges No. 78 on their list of 100 of the most influential artists of the past 50 years.

Layne Staley, of Alice in Chains, said that he was a big fan of The Stooges.

Emanuel covered &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; on the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; soundtrack.

In 2009, Cage the Elephant gave away a free cover version of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; on their website if users registered with their mailing list service.

Slash, of Guns N&#x27; Roses, included their self-titled debut amongst his favorite studio albums.

Peter Hook included their live album &quot;Metallic K.O.&quot; amongst his favorite albums.

<text>An infix is an affix inserted inside a word stem (an existing word or the core of a family of words). It contrasts with &quot;adfix,&quot; a rare term for an affix attached to the outside of a stem, such as a prefix or suffix.

When marking text for interlinear glossing, most affixes are separated with a hyphen, but infixes are separated with .

== English ==
English has almost no true infixes and those it does have are marginal. Most are heard in colloquial speech; although there are other examples, such as in technical terminology, these examples are often more accurately described as tmesis.

===Colloquialisms===
None of the following are recognized in standard English.
* The infix or is characteristic of hip-hop slang, for example &quot;h-iz-ouse&quot; for &quot;house&quot; and &quot;sh-izn-it&quot; for &quot;shit.&quot;
* The infix (or &quot;Homeric infix,&quot; after Homer Simpson), gives a word an ironic pseudo-sophistication, as in &quot;sophisti-ma-cated (sophisticated), saxo-ma-phone,&quot; (saxophone) and &quot;edu-ma-cation.&quot; (education) This exists as a slang phenomenon.
*Infixes also occur in some language games.
* The use of &#x27;expletive infixes&#x27; such as &quot;-fucking-&quot; and &quot;-bloody-&quot;, which are words rather than affixes, is known as tmesis.

==Indo-European nasal infix==

The present tense of some Proto-Indo-European verbs, in the case of a certain number of roots, adds a nasal infix (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) to the basic root. The stems of the other tenses have the root without the infix, and thus these verbs are called &quot;nasal-presents&quot;. This phenomenon is inherited, and preserved to varying degrees, by some early daughter languages such as Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Latin language, etc.

* Sanskrit exhibits the greatest transparency of this feature amongst the Indo-European languages, with the phenomenon manifesting in three of the ten traditional verb classes, where the infix is higher-grade and accent-bearing in the strong forms, and reduced-grade in the weak forms. For example, , &#x27;join&#x27; has &#x27;s/he joins&#x27; ↔ , &#x27;they join&#x27;.

* Latin present &quot;I win&quot; (cf. perfect passive participle &quot;conquered&quot;)
* Ancient Greek (also with suffix) &quot;I take&quot; (cf. aorist &quot;I took&quot;)

==Spanish==
In Nicaraguan, Costa Rican, and Honduran Spanish, the Spanish diminutive affix becomes an infix in names: → (cf. standard ); → ; → . This diminutive infix can also be found for the word , due to its unusual form as a paroxytone word with a final /r/, giving .

==Arabic==
Arabic uses a common infix, for Form VIII verbs, usually a reflexive of Form I. It is placed after the first consonant of the root; an epenthetic &quot;i-&quot; prefix is also added, since words cannot begin with a consonant cluster. An example is &quot;he worked hard&quot;, from &quot;he strove&quot;. (The words and are nouns derived from these two verbs.)

==Austronesian and Austroasiatic languages==
Infixes are common in some Austronesian and Austroasiatic languages, but not in others. For example, in Tagalog, a grammatical form similar to the active voice is formed by adding the infix near the beginning of a verb. The most common infix is which marks the perfect aspect, as in &quot;, meaning &#x27;ruined&#x27; (from &quot;, an adjective meaning &#x27;worn-out&#x27;); &quot;, meaning &#x27;stoned&#x27; (from &quot;, &#x27;stone&#x27;); and &quot;, meaning &#x27;used&#x27;. Tagalog has borrowed the English word &quot;graduate&quot; as a verb; to say &quot;I graduated&quot; a speaker uses the derived form .

Khmer, an Austroasiatic language, has seven different infixes. They include the nominalizing infix , which derives &#x27;speed&#x27; from &#x27;fast&#x27; and &#x27; trial&#x27; from &#x27;to test, to haunt&#x27;, or the agentive deriving &#x27;watchman&#x27; from &#x27;to watch&#x27;. These elements are no longer productive, and occur crystallized in words inherited from Old Khmer.

In Malay and Indonesian, there are three infixes (&quot;sisipan&quot;), , , and . All infixes are no longer productive and cannot be used to derive new words.
Examples include:
* The word &#x27;gembung&#x27; (variant of &#x27;kembung&#x27;) means &quot;bloated&quot;, while &#x27;gelembung&#x27; means &quot;bubble&quot;&#x27;.
* The word &#x27;cerlang&#x27; means &quot;luminous&quot;, while &#x27;cemerlang&#x27; means &quot;brilliant&quot;&#x27;.
* The word &#x27;gigi&#x27; means &quot;tooth&quot;, while &#x27;gerigi&#x27; means &quot;serration&quot;&#x27;.

==Seri==
In Seri, some verbs form the plural stem with infixation of after the first vowel of the root; compare the singular stem &quot;ic&quot; &#x27;plant (verb)&#x27; with the plural stem &quot;itóoc&quot;. Examples: &quot;itíc&quot; &#x27;did s/he plant it?&#x27; and &quot;ititóoc&quot; &#x27;did they sow it?&#x27;.

== Similar processes ==
Tmesis, the use of a lexical word rather than an affix, is sometimes considered a type of infixation. These are the so-called &quot;expletive infixes&quot;, as in &quot;abso-bloody-lutely&quot;. Since these are not affixes, they are commonly disqualified from being considered infixes.

Sequences of adfixes (prefixes or suffixes) do not result in infixes: an infix must be internal to a word stem. Thus, the word &quot;originally,&quot; formed by adding the suffix &quot;-ly&quot; to &quot;original,&quot; does not turn the suffix &quot;-al&quot; into an infix. There is simply a sequence of two suffixes, &quot;origin-al-ly.&quot; In order for &quot;-al-&quot; to be considered an infix, it would have to have been inserted in the non-existent word &quot;*originly.&quot; The &quot;infixes&quot; in the tradition of Bantu linguistics are often sequences of prefixes of this type, though there may be debate over specific cases.

The Semitic languages have a form of &quot;ablaut&quot; (changing the vowels within words, as in English &quot;sing, sang, sung, song)&quot; that is sometimes called infixation, as the vowels are placed between the consonants of the root. However, this interdigitation of a discontinuous root with a discontinuous affix is more often called &quot;transfixation&quot;.

An &quot;interfix&quot; joins a compound word, as in &quot;speed-o-meter&quot;.

== Glossing ==

When glossing, it is conventional to set off infixes with , rather than the hyphens used to set off prefixes and suffixes:
:&quot;shit, saxophone, picoline&quot;

Compare:
:&quot;origin-al-ly&quot;
which contains the suffix &quot;-ly&quot; added to the word &quot;original,&quot; which is itself formed by adding the suffix &quot;-al&quot; to the root &quot;origin.&quot;

<text>Patience (Middle English: &quot;Pacience&quot;) is a Middle English alliterative poem written in the late 14th century. Its unknown author, designated the &quot;Pearl Poet&quot; or &quot;Gawain-Poet&quot;, also appears, on the basis of dialect and stylistic evidence, to be the author of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Cleanness&quot; (all ca. 1360–1395) and may have composed &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;. This is thought to be true because the techniques and vocabulary of regional dialect of the unknown author is that of Northwest Midlands, located between Shropshire and Lancashire.

The manuscript, Cotton Nero A.x is in the British Library. The first complete publication of &quot;Patience&quot; was in &quot;Early English Alliterative Poems in the West Midland Dialect of the fourteenth century&quot;, printed by the Early English Text Society in 1864.
Of Patience, considered the slightest of the four poems, its only manifest source is the Vulgate Bible. It also resembles Latin poems by Tertullian and Bishop Marbod. There are certain mannerisms found in Patience that Pearl does not have. For instance, both homilies clearly follow the same pattern: 1. statement of theme, 2. announcement of the text from the New Testament, 3. discussion of another passage from the New Testament in elucidation of that text, 4. and elaborate paraphrase of &quot;exemplum&quot; or &quot;exempla&quot;, from the Old Testament.

== Genre and poetics ==
A didactic, homiletic poem, “Patience” consists of 530 lines. Alliteration is used consistently throughout the poem, usually with three alliterating words per line. The very last line repeats the opening line of the poem, giving it a kind of cyclic feel. The unidentified narrator speaks in the first person throughout the work, posing as an autobiography.

==Narrative==
The narrator/homilist begins by praising patience, setting it among eight virtues (which he calls blessings) or typically known as the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:3-10 from the Sermon on the Mount, which he hears in mass one day. He closely associates it with poverty, closing with an admonition not to grumble or fight one&#x27;s fate, as Jonah did (ll. 1 - 56). The remainder of the work utilizes the story of Jonah as an exemplum which illustrates and justifies the admonition to accept the will of God patiently. Jonah&#x27;s story delineates his own impatience because he could not handle the burden of what he was supposed to do — preach to the Ninevites.
Notably, patience is generally paired in opposition to sloth. Medieval schools of thought would have condemned sloth, portraying negative consequences of those who fall into sloth, which essentially, is what the poet is trying to convey. Jonah, although written centuries prior to the poet&#x27;s time, is an exemplary model of impatience, yet God still shows his loving mercy toward him, demonstrating that &quot;the love he feels for his creatures whom he has nurtured and thus does not want to harm them&quot; (Szarmach, 531). The poem ends with its opening lines.

==Author==

Though the real name of the author, called &quot;The &quot;Pearl&quot; Poet&quot;, is unknown, some inferences can be drawn from an informed reading of their works. The original manuscript is known in academic circles as &quot;Cotton Nero A.x&quot;, following a naming system used by one of its owners, Robert Cotton, a collector of Medieval English texts.

Before the manuscript came into Cotton&#x27;s possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile of Bank in Yorkshire. Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, so the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, though it is highly unlikely that they ever met. The three other works found in the same manuscript as &quot;Pearl&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Cleanness&quot; or &quot;Purity&quot;) are often considered to be written by the same author, who is accepted to be from the Staffordshire/North Shropshire/Cheshire area. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet, known by scribal errors. Suggested emandations may be found in &quot;&quot;Patience: An Alliterative Version of &quot;Jonah&quot; by the Poet of &quot;Pearl.&quot; Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single-authorship.

What is known today about the poet is largely general. As J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the text&#x27;s allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:
W. A. Davenport commented:

The Gawain-poet had a flair for vivid pictures and dramatic situations, and found intellectual delight in pattern: combinations of qualities provides much of the enjoyment of the poems, the conflict between them some uncertainty and complexity. Four works were shaped by a man of subtle mind, interested in not just narrative and describing opportunities of his material, but in exploring its equivocal nature. Many problems experienced by readers in interpreting poems, and the wide variety of interpretations offered for Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are shown to stem from the poet’s complex view of moral questions (103).
The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem, &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to &quot;Gawain&quot;. &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet&#x27;s era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.

==Style==
Although most of the work is a paraphrase of the biblical Book of Jonah, the poet has expanded upon the text in many places. The chief characteristics of his expansions are a colloquial tone, esp. in Jonah&#x27;s prayers and his conversations with God, and the concrete descriptions which are used throughout. The homilist is creative, which Jonah&#x27;s monologues and descriptions of the storm and belly of the whale unveil the poet&#x27;s improvisation and colorful retelling of story, such as the manner how Jonah floats into the whale&#x27;s mouth &quot;like a mote going through the church door&quot; (268 ). This is meant as the antithesis of its example. Jonah is the impatient, which makes for a perfect &quot;what not to do&quot; example to include the poet&#x27;s story.
Furthermore, the author changes perspective &quot;with an eye toward the psychological motives of God, as well as Jonah&quot; (Szarmach,568). This humanizes God, which would not have been a known theological concept in the 14th century, distinguishing this poem from the others.

<doc id="146029" wikidata="Q2124771" url="?curid=146029" title="The Luck of Barry Lyndon">
<text>The Luck of Barry Lyndon is a picaresque novel by English author William Makepeace Thackeray, first published as a serial in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1844, about a member of the Irish gentry trying to become a member of the English aristocracy. Thackeray, who based the novel on the life and exploits of the Anglo-Irish rake and fortune-hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney, later reissued it under the title The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq. The novel is narrated by Lyndon himself, who functions as a quintessentially unreliable narrator.

The novel was adapted by Stanley Kubrick into his 1975 film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.

==The name==
Barry is a surname and a masculine given name, the English form of the Irish name Bareth (itself an abbreviation of Fionnbharrth), Barra, Barrath, Barenth, Barold, Bearrach, or Finbarr. The word, from the Irish Celtic bearach, means &quot;spear&quot; in English. Thackeray was fond of this name during his travels in Ireland, although at the time he had not yet made a final decision on it. As for Redmond, it is a common given name that emphasizes the redness of the hair. Barryogue, which Redmond sometimes uses in a grandiose manner, suggests his rogue-like qualities.

As for Lyndon (or Lindon), the name derives from the Flemish Linden, meaning &quot;place where lime trees grow,&quot; from which the tree itself and its flower are extended. It also exists in German with the same meaning; see Unter den Linden, the famous avenue in Berlin.

==Plot summary==
Redmond Barry of Ballybarry, born to a genteel but ruined Irish family, fancies himself a gentleman. At the prompting of his mother, he learns what he can of courtly manners and swordplay but fails at more scholarly subjects like Latin. He is a passionate, hot-tempered young man who develops a deep love for Nora, his cousin, who is a few years older than Redmond. However, even though Nora enjoys flirting with Redmond, she is only interested in a man with money. 

Redmond becomes angered when Nora is courted by John Quin, who is not only wealthy but also a respected officer and nobleman. A dueling challenge is issued, but Nora&#x27;s family sees an opportunity to drive him off and secretly load his pistol with tow, a dummy load of heavy, knotted fibres.

Quin fakes his death, and Redmond is convinced by Nora&#x27;s parents that he will be charged with murder. As expected, he flees to Dublin and falls in with swindlers who take advantage of his naivety. Left penniless and with creditors at his heels, Redmond enlists as a common private in a British Army infantry regiment headed for service in Germany during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Once in Germany, despite a promotion to corporal, he hates the army and seeks to desert. When Lieutenant Fakenham is wounded and left for dead, Redmond seduces a rich peasant woman to get him food and shelter. Redmond pretends to suffer from insanity, and after several days absconds with the lieutenant&#x27;s uniform, papers, and money. As part of his ruse, he convinces the locals that he is the real Lieutenant Fakenham, and the wounded man is the mad Corporal Barry. He then rides off for a neutral part of Germany to seek his fortune.

His bad luck continues, however, as he is quickly captured by a Prussian officer. The German soon realises that Redmond is a deserter, but rather than turn him over to the British to be hanged, impresses him into the Prussian Army (for a bounty). Redmond hates Prussian service as much or more than he hated British service, but the men are carefully watched to prevent desertion. Redmond marches with Frederick&#x27;s army into the Battle of Kunersdorf and barely survives. He saves the life of Captain Potzdorff; the captain takes him in as his aide and later gets Redmond a job working for the Prussian state ministry.

After several months have passed, a stranger travelling under Austrian protection arrives in Berlin. Redmond is asked to spy on the stranger, an older man called &quot;Chevalier de Balibari&quot; (sc. Ballybarry). He immediately realises that this is his uncle, a notorious Catholic adventurer who disappeared many years ago. The uncle uses his connections to smuggle himself and his nephew out of Prussia, and they quickly take up lives as gamblers and spendthrifts.

Eventually, the Barrys end up in a Rhineland duchy. After winning a large sum of money, enough to present himself as a rich aristocrat, Redmond schemes to marry into the family of a young German heiress. Again, fortune turns against him, and a series of circumstances undermines his complex plan. (The story of the unhappy Princess Olivia was based on a scandalous account of Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel by Étienne-Léon de Lamothe-Langon.) The two Barrys are subsequently forced out of Germany in disgrace.

While staying in France following his uncle&#x27;s death, Redmond comes into the acquaintance of the Countess of Lyndon, an extraordinarily wealthy noblewoman married to a much older man in poor health. He has some success in seducing the lady, but her husband clings to life. Eventually, she and her husband return to England. Redmond is upset but bides his time. Upon hearing that the husband has died the following year, he makes his move on the Countess.

Through a series of adventures, Redmond eventually bullies and seduces the Countess, who marries him somewhat under duress, but also falls in love with him. After the wedding, he remodels her home, Hackton Castle, at great expense. Count Barry Lyndon (as he now calls himself) admits several times in the course of his narrative that he is incapable of managing money, despite his history of poverty and hardship. He looks after a few childhood benefactors in Ireland, including his cousin Ulick (Nora&#x27;s brother, who had often stood up for him as a boy) who he personally styles into a fashionable young socialite.

As the American Revolutionary War breaks out, Barry seeks to raise his prestige, financing a regiment of men to serve in America and gaining control of the Lyndon family pocket borough so he may sit in Parliament. However, his good fortunes ebb again: his stepson (and his wife&#x27;s heir), Lord Bullingdon, is reported dead in America; as Barry had commissioned the boy commander of his regiment, he is accused of plotting his demise. His own child, Bryan, dies in a tragic horse-riding accident at nine years of age. This, combined with Barry&#x27;s profligate spending practices, leads to his ruin. With his son dead, he is now at the mercy of his wife&#x27;s hostile cousins, who gain control of the Lyndon estate.

As the &quot;memoir&quot; ends, Barry is separated from his wife and placed in Fleet Prison as a debtor. A small stipend provided by his wife allows him to live in moderate luxury at first, and his elderly mother lodges close by to tend to him. Unfortunately for him, Lord Bullingdon was not dead – he had been captured and imprisoned but survived until the end of the war. When the Countess dies, her son is quick to disown his stepfather and cut off any further allowances. The story ends with Barry dying of complications from drinking cheap prison liquor.

==Writing and publication==

===A difficult writing process===
Thackeray began writing &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon: A Romance of the Last Century. By Fitz-Boodle&quot; in Paris in October 1843, and &quot;Fraser&#x27;s&quot; began publishing installments starting in January of the following year. Throughout the monthly releases, Thackeray managed to keep an advance of one or two chapters, but in October 1844, the promised manuscript was not ready on time, and the editor-in-chief Nickisson published another text in its place. The author complains about the difficulty of the task, which requires much more reading than he thought and deals with a subject that is not very sympathetic. He wrote on 14 August 1844 that it had become a nightmare and with relief, on 3 November 1844, he put the final period, noting: &quot;Finished Barry after much agony last night.&quot; The final part was written during a trip to Egypt, and the ultimate chapter in Malta in October 1844 on the way back, while the ship was in quarantine in the port of Valletta.

The original title of the 1844 publication contains the word &quot;luck&quot;, which in this context does not mean &quot;chance&quot; but &quot;worldly success&quot;. The choice of this word indicates that this success results from the wealth and social importance that come from marrying the richest widow in the kingdom. According to a terminology peculiar to Barry, the alternation between &quot;luck&quot; and &quot;ill-luck&quot; marks the fluctuations of his fortune.

The first edition of 1844 is composed of two asymmetrical parts: sixteen chapters are devoted to Barry&#x27;s social ascent, and three (published in September, November, and December 1844) to his decline and fall.

===The second publication in England===
When republished in 1865, along with several other stories, in a book titled &quot;Miscellanies&quot;; the novel became &quot;The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq., By Himself&quot;, the publisher&#x27;s initiative followed by a plethora of pompous mentions emphasizing the grandiose destiny of the scoundrel.

This version contains some modifications: the first two chapters were merged into one; in the second part, the beginning of chapter XVII was deleted; and a long passage from the conclusion dealing with immanent justice was deleted. Original, Thackeray wrote, that this justice is absent from this world, with villains remaining rich while honest people are just as poor; and further insisting a little later &quot;Justice, great God! Does human life show justice in this way? Do the good always ride in a gilded carriage and the wicked go to the hospice? Is the charlatan never preferred to the capable? Does the world always reward merit, never fall for verbiage, never rush to hear some ass bray from his pulpit?&quot;. In addition, some of the digressions written in the third person, actually intrusions by the author, are reinserted, but in the first person, that is, placed this time in Barry&#x27;s mouth. Finally, the pseudonym Fitz-Boodle is abandoned, and &quot;Miscellanies&quot; in its entirety is signed by William Makepeace Thackeray.

Although the book was harshly judged during its serialization, the tone changed considerably upon its publication in volumes. By 1856, Thackeray was recognized as one of the masters of the English novel, and his works were appreciated with greater consideration. The influential &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, founded by Alexander Beresford Hope in 1855, considered Barry Lyndon to be the most characteristic and successful of Thackeray&#x27;s works. Several of the author&#x27;s colleagues emphasized the tour de force represented by this novel, particularly Trollope, who proclaimed that &quot;if Dickens revealed the best of his creative power early in life, Thackeray showed himself to have a superior intellect. Never has the strength of his mind been raised higher than in Barry Lyndon, and I know of no storyteller whose intellectual faculties can surpass this prodigious enterprise.&quot; American writer William Dean Howells, who read the novel as early as 1852, wrote that it was &quot;the most perfect creation [...] a fabulous feat of pure irony.&quot; Finally, Anne Thackeray Ritchie, the novelist&#x27;s daughter, after recounting the anecdote in which her father advised her against reading the book, wrote: &quot;Certainly, it is a difficult book to love, but one admires it for its consummate power and art.&quot;

==Inspiration==

===Andrew Robinson Stoney-Bowes===
Thackeray got the idea for this novel during a visit with the art collector John Bowes (whom he knew from school) to Streatlam Castle in June and July 1841. In &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, he wrote:

In fact, these documents come from the Strathmore family, of which John Bowes is the illegitimate descendant, and are collected in a pamphlet by Jesse Foot, entitled &quot;Lives of Andrew Robinson Stoney-Bowes and the Countess of Strathmore&quot;, published in London in 1812. Bowes owns an annotated copy that Thackeray probably knew about, and the character of Andrew Robinson Bowes immediately fascinates him

===The Irish Robin Hood===
According to other sources, an inspiration for his character was Captain James Freney, the &quot;Irish Robin Hood&quot;, whose adventures he read about in an inn in Galway in 1841, whom he places in his novel on Barry&#x27;s path in Ireland shortly after his hero&#x27;s departure for the great world, and who is briefly mentioned in chapter IV where Barry learns about his exploits from Mrs. Fitzsimmons. However, while Freney, in Thackeray&#x27;s words, &quot;declines great deeds with all modesty&quot;, Barry brandishes &quot;little deeds high and loud&quot;. According to another hypothesis, the model encompasses the Irish in general, whom he sketched in his &quot;Irish Sketch Book&quot; of 1843, &quot;this brilliant, audacious, belligerent, exuberant, whiskey-drinking people&quot;.

===An Irish snobbery===
In fact, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; contains several episodes already used in this &quot;Irish Sketch Book&quot;, for example, Barry&#x27;s arrival in Dublin where he is greeted with much fervor and adulation. In his travel journal, Thackeray notes: 

===A cosmopolitan novel===
Finally, as Thackeray wrote, he traveled constantly, hence, according to some critics, the cosmopolitan aspect of the novel, with significant episodes set in France or Germany, and also some details echoing the author&#x27;s Middle Eastern tour, such as Barry&#x27;s stay in Ludwigslust where he is accompanied by a &quot;negro&quot; named Zamor, dresses in Turkish clothing, and stays in a &quot;palace arranged in an Oriental and quite sumptuous manner&quot;.

==Themes==

===A question of genealogy===
From the first paragraphs of his narrative, with the help of heraldists, the Englishman Gwillim and the Frenchman Louis Pierre d&#x27;Hozier (p. 13, then 139, according to the 1975 edition used as a reference), Barry takes stock of his lineage: &quot;I am of the opinion that there is no gentleman in all of Europe who has not heard of the Barry family of Barryogue, in the kingdom of Ireland [...]&quot; Throughout the novel, he frequently returns to this subject, especially in chapter IV where his uncle, the Chevalier de Bali-Bari, asserts that this is &quot;the only knowledge becoming of a gentleman.&quot; In fact, Thackeray himself shared this concern for genealogy, particularly while writing the novel; Fraser&#x27;s Magazine had just featured Drummond (a list of noble families with mention of their genealogy) as a theme before The Luck of Barry Lyndon.

===Nobility of heart===
This question of nobility of heart as opposed to that of birth is in the air: Dickens takes it up four years after Barry Lyndon in Great Expectations (1860), another first-person novel, where he has Herbert Pocket say exactly the same thing as he undertakes to instill some life principles in young Pip and quotes his father Matthew Pocket: &quot;It is one of his principles that no man has ever behaved like a gentleman without first having been, since the world began, a gentleman at heart. He says, there is no veneer that can hide the grain of wood, and the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself.&quot; In the same novel, Joe Gargery the blacksmith, who has always protected Pip from the wrath of his shrewish sister, goes to London to see his young brother-in-law. Not knowing quite what to do with his hat on arrival, he realizes that Pip is now ashamed of him; sorry for not having respected his rank, he returns disillusioned to his forge, while Pip, led astray by snobbery, says, &quot;He made me lose my temper and exasperated me&quot; (chapter XXVII, p. 631).

===Events in Ireland===
Another concern of Thackeray&#x27;s is the events in Ireland: although the story of Barry Lyndon is supposed to take place in the 18th century, the book echoes the Anglo-Irish relations of the first half of the 19th century, especially the campaign for the abolition of the Act of Union, which, under the impetus of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, raged in the 1840s and culminated in 1843 with the revival of the so-called Irish Home Rule movement.

===The tyrannical rakehell===
The last part of the story, concerning Redmond Barry&#x27;s tumultuous relationship with Lady Lyndon, is inspired by the life of Andrew Robinson Stoney-Bowes, a type of character that the English commonly call a &quot;Rake&quot; or &quot;Rakehell&quot;, meaning a gambler, debaucher, reveller, and indebted person. And according to Robert A. Colby, the plot involving the is based on what Thackeray called &quot;a silly little book&quot;, titled &quot;L&#x27;Empire, ou, Dix ans sous Napoléon&quot; (1836), by Baron Étienne-Léon de Lamothe-Langon (1786-1864), which relates, among other things, the execution of Princess Caroline by the King of Wurttemberg for adultery The two stories seem to have merged in Thackeray&#x27;s mind, as both involve tyrannical husbands, hysterical wives, and adultery against a backdrop of a corrupt society.

===The Irishman William Maginn===
Barry&#x27;s grim ending echoes that of the real-life Irish journalist and co-founder of &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, William Maginn (1794-1842). &quot;Maginn a superb subject for a little morality&quot;, comments Thackeray upon reading an obituary tribute published in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s&quot;. However, unlike Barry, who is uneducated, Maginn is a scholarly and witty scholar, but shares with him an easy charm and an abyssal prodigality, and in 1842 his indebtedness landed him in Fleet Prison, from which he only emerged, consumed by tuberculosis, to die that same year.

===The dandy George Brummell===
A parallel can also be drawn between the shameful end of Barry in prison and the miserable exile of the famous &quot;Beau&quot; Brummell (1778-1840) in France, who fled from his debts and whose career has been in the spotlight since William Jesse published his biography in 1844. Thackeray himself gave a review of this publication in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; of 6 May 1844, reprinted in &quot;&quot;, Gordon N. Ray, Urbana, Illinois, 1995, p. 31-39, while &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; was being written. Moreover, in chapter XIII, p. 193, Thackeray places an allusion in the form of a wink under the pen of his narrator hero:

This was an exclamation intended for the Victorian public.

===The seducer Giacomo Casanova===
Finally, it is not excluded, according to Anisman, cited by Colby, that Thackeray may have thought, or even borrowed from the &quot;Mémoires de Jacques Casanova&quot; to which Barry refers in chapter IX, the Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova (1725–1798) mentioned twice (pp. 128, 141) and who, like Barry, writes that he &quot;lived like a philosopher&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Stanley Kubrick adapted the novel into the film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, released in 1975. Unlike in the novel, the film is not narrated by the titular character.

Irish playwright Don McCamphill produced a similar two-hour radio dramatization for the BBC in 2003. McCamphill&#x27;s follows the book more closely than Kubrick&#x27;s but is more condensed.

<doc id="146031" wikidata="Q42959" url="?curid=146031" title="Himalayan cat">
<text>The Himalayan (short for Himalayan Persian, or Colourpoint Persian as it is commonly referred to in Europe), is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired cat similar in type to the Persian, with the exception of its blue eyes and its point colouration, which were derived from crossing the Persian with the Siamese. Some registries may classify the Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed of Siamese, or a colorpoint sub-breed of Persian. The World Cat Federation has merged them with the Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese into a single breed, the Colorpoint.

==History==
Work to formally establish a breed with combined Persian and Siamese traits, explicitly for the cat fancy, began in the United States in the 1930s at Harvard University, under the term Siamese–Persian, and the results were published in the &quot;Journal of Heredity&quot; in 1936, but were not adopted as a recognized breed by any major fancier groups at the time. Brian Sterling-Webb independently developed the cross-breed over a period of ten years in the UK, and in 1955 it was recognized there as the Longhaired Colourpoint by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF).

California cat breeder Jean Mill took a series of graduate classes in genetics at the University of California, Davis. By 1948, she was one of three breeders independently crossing the Persian and Siamese to create the Himalayan cat.

Separate US-based breeding efforts had begun around 1950, and a breeder known to sources simply as Mrs. Goforth received breed recognition from the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) near the end of 1957 for the Himalayan. Early breeders were mostly interested in adding Siamese colouration to long-haired cats, and therefore reinforced the stock by outbreeding to Persians only to retain the Persian trait dominance. However, by the 1960s, some were re-introducing Siamese stock and producing less &quot;Persian-style&quot; cats, In the 1980s, a concerted effort to re-establish the breed along more formally Persian lines ultimately caused the breed to be merged into Persian as a variant in some registries (e.g. in 1984 by CFA), and a decline in the &quot;old&quot; or Siamese-like specimens.

==Recognition==
The Himalayan is considered a colour variant of the Persian and not a separate breed by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association and the GCCF. The Himalayan is considered a separate breed by the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association.

==Appearance==

The Himalayan resembles the Persian in type, conformation, and coat length and texture. The Himalayan does not resemble the Siamese in type.

===Body===
The Himalayan is medium to large in size with a cobby body and low legs.

===Head===
The Himalayan&#x27;s head is round and massive with a round face and a thick neck. The nose is snubbed and pushed in.

===Ears===
The ears of the Himalayan are small and round tipped and slightly pointed forward.

===Eyes===
The eyes are large and round and spread well apart. Pointed Himalayans have blue eyes, non-pointed Himalayans have copper eyes except for the silver and golden tabby which have green eyes.

===Coat===
The Himalayan has a long and thick coat all over the body including the tail and ear and toe tufts.

====Coat colours====
The Himalayan comes in most colours with prohibited colours being mink and sepia.

==Health==
Like the Persian, the Himalayan is a brachycephalic breed which predisposes it to health issues such as respiratory infections, epiphora, corneal abrasions, ulcers, and corneal sequestration. Himalayans are also suspecitible to polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary condition that results in cysts growing in the kidney. Himalayans have a higher incidence of feline asthma.
In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Himalayan was under-represented, with an odds ratio of 0.37. A study of cats presented to the University of Missouri-Columbia Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital that underwent radiography found 4 Himalayans out of a population of 16 to have hip dysplasia, higher than the 6.6% average for all cats.

Himalayans are predisposed to dermatophytosis (ringworm).

The Himalayan is predisposed to urticaria pigmentosa, a type of benign mast cell disorder.

Idiopathic facial dermatitis, also known as facial dermatitis of the Persian and Himalayan cat is a type of dermatitis only observed in the Persian and Himalayan cat. It&#x27;s characterised by greasy skin, debris adhering to the folds of the face and nose, ceruminous otitis externa, secondary bacterial folliculitis and &quot;Malassezia&quot; dermatitis, and pruritus. Onset is at 10 months to 6 years.

==In popular culture==
*In the CBS television detective series &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Witch&quot; (1982), a Himalayan cat named Dickens is the familiar to witch Amanda Tucker. Amanda Tucker has a telepathic link with Dickens, who provides her and her husband with clairvoyant clues to help them solve mysteries. Dickens is featured prominently in the show&#x27;s opening and closing credits.
*In the spoof film &quot;Date Movie&quot; (2006), Mr. Jinxers is a parody of his &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; counterpart.
*In the movies &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; (1993) and &quot;Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco&quot; (1996), one of the main characters is a Himalayan cat named Sassy (voiced by Sally Field).
*The main character of the anime/manga &quot;Prince of Tennis&quot;, Ryoma Echizen, owns a Himalayan cat named Karupin (or Kalpin in the English translation).
*Martha Stewart owns three Himalayans, named after composers: Beethoven, Mozart and Bartók. The cats have been featured in her commercials for Kmart, on her television show, &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot;, and in her magazine, such as the cover of the February 1999 issue.
*A Himalayan named Luna The Fashion Kitty became a social media phenomenon in 2011 with a popular Facebook page, a website, and several media references.
*A Himalayan-Persian named Colonel Meow became an Internet celebrity in 2012, and entered &quot;Guinness World Records 2014&quot; as the cat with the longest fur.
*Mr. Jinx (also known as Jinxy, or simply just Jinx) from the &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; trilogy is a seal-point peke-faced Himalayan with an all-black tail.
*The &quot;narrator&quot; of David Michie&#x27;s series of books that begins with &quot;The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Cat&quot; is a Himalayan cat.
*A community-created cosmetic item for the Medic and Spy classes in the 2007 computer game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; is a Red Point Himalayan cat named &quot;Harry&quot;.

<text>The Official Irish Republican Army or Official IRA (OIRA; ) was an Irish republican paramilitary group whose goal was to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a &quot;workers&#x27; republic&quot; encompassing all of Ireland. It emerged in December 1969, shortly after the beginning of the Troubles, when the Irish Republican Army (IRA) split into two factions. The other was the Provisional IRA. Each continued to call itself simply &quot;the IRA&quot; and rejected the other&#x27;s legitimacy.

Unlike the &quot;Provisionals&quot;, the &quot;Officials&quot; did not think that Ireland could be unified until the Protestant majority and Catholic minority of Northern Ireland were at peace. The Officials were Marxist-Leninists and worked to form a united front with other Irish communist groups, named the Irish National Liberation Front (NLF). The Officials were called the NLF by the Provisionals and &quot;stickies&quot; by nationalists in Belfast (apparently in reference to members who would glue Easter lilies to their uniforms), and they were sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Red IRA&quot; by others.

It waged a limited campaign against the British Army, mainly involving shooting and bombing attacks on troops in urban working-class neighbourhoods. Most notably, it was involved in the 1970 Falls Curfew and carried out the 1972 Aldershot bombing. In May 1972, it declared a ceasefire and vowed to limit its actions to defence and retaliation. By this time, the Provisional IRA had become the larger and more active faction. Following the ceasefire, the OIRA began to be referred to as &quot;Group B&quot; within the Official movement. It became involved in feuds with the Provisional IRA and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), an OIRA splinter group formed in 1974. It has also been involved in organized crime and vigilantism.

The Official IRA was linked to the political party Official Sinn Féin, later renamed Sinn Féin The Workers Party and then the Workers&#x27; Party.

== Split in the Republican movement, 1969–1970 ==

===Shift to the left===
The split in the Irish Republican Army, soon followed by a parallel split in Sinn Féin, was the result of the dissatisfaction of more traditional and militant republicans at the political direction taken by the leadership. The particular object of their discontent was Sinn Féin&#x27;s ending of its policy of abstentionism in the Republic of Ireland. This issue is a key one in republican ideology, as traditional republicans regarded the Irish state as illegitimate and maintained that their loyalty was due only to the Irish Republic declared in 1916 and in their view, represented by the IRA Army Council.

During the 1960s, the republican movement under the leadership of Cathal Goulding radically re-assessed their ideology and tactics after the dismal failure of the IRA&#x27;s Border Campaign in the years 1956–62. They were heavily influenced by popular front ideology and drew close to communist thinking. A key intermediary body was the Communist Party of Great Britain&#x27;s organisation for Irish exiles, the Connolly Association. The Marxist analysis was that the conflict in Northern Ireland was a &quot;bourgeois nationalist&quot; one between the Ulster Protestant and Irish Catholic working classes, fomented and continued by the ruling class. Its effect was to depress wages, since worker could be set against worker. They concluded that the first step on the road to a 32-county socialist republic in Ireland was the &quot;democratisation&quot; of Northern Ireland (i.e., the removal of discrimination against Catholics) and radicalisation of the southern working class. This would allow &quot;class politics&quot; to develop, eventually resulting in a challenge to the hegemony of both what they termed &quot;British imperialism&quot; and the respective unionist and Irish nationalist establishments north and south of the Irish border.

Goulding and those close to him argued that, in the context of sectarian division in Northern Ireland, a military campaign against the British presence would be counter-productive, since it would delay the day when the workers would unite to address social and economic issues.

The sense that the IRA seemed to be drifting away from its conventional republican roots into Marxism angered more traditional republicans. The radicals viewed Ulster Protestants with unionist views as &quot;fellow Irishmen deluded by bourgeois loyalties, who needed to be engaged in dialectical debate&quot;. As a result, they were reluctant to use force to defend Catholic areas of Belfast when they came under attack from Ulster loyalists—a role the IRA had performed since the 1920s. Since the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association marches began in 1968, there had been many cases of street violence. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had been shown on television in undisciplined baton charges, and had already killed five non-combatant civilians, three of whom were children. The Orange Order&#x27;s &quot;marching season&quot; during the summer of 1969 had been characterised by violence on both sides, which culminated in the three-day &quot;Battle of the Bogside&quot; in Derry.

===August 1969 riots===

The critical moment came in August 1969 when there was a major outbreak of intercommunal violence in Belfast and Derry, with eight deaths, six of them Catholics, and whole streets ablaze. On 14–15 August loyalists burned out several Catholic streets in Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969. IRA units offered resistance, however very few weapons were available for the defence of Catholic areas. Many local IRA figures, and ex-IRA members such as Joe Cahill and Billy McKee, were incensed by what they saw as the leadership&#x27;s decision not to take sides and in September, they announced that they would no longer be taking orders from the Goulding leadership.

Discontent was not confined to the northern IRA units. In the south also, such figures as Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Sean MacStiofain opposed both the leadership&#x27;s proposed recognition of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This increasing political divergence led to a formal split at the 1969 IRA Convention, held in December. when a group led by Ó Brádaigh and MacStiofán walked out. The split resulted from a vote at the first IRA Convention where a two-thirds majority voted that republicans should take their seats if elected to the British, Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland Parliaments. At a second convention, a group consisting of Mac Stiofáin, Dáithí Ó Conaill, Ó Brádaigh, Joe Cahill, Paddy Mulcahy, Leo Martin, and Sean Tracey, were elected as the &quot;Provisional&quot; Army Council. Their supporters included Seamus Twomey.

Accounts at that time suggest that the IRA members split roughly in half, with those loyal to the Goulding-led &quot;Official&quot; IRA prominent in some areas while the Provisional IRA were prominent in others. A strong area for the Official IRA in Belfast was the Lower Falls and Markets district, which were under the command of Billy McMillen. Other OIRA units were located in Derry, Newry, Strabane, Dublin, Wicklow and other parts of Belfast. However, the Provisionals would rapidly become the dominant faction, both as a result of intensive recruitment in response to the sectarian violence and because some Official IRA units (such as the Strabane company) later defected to them.

There was a similar ideological split in Sinn Féin after a contentious 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. The leadership of Sinn Féin passed a motion to recognise the Parliaments in London, Dublin and Stormont but failed to attain the prerequisite two-thirds majority necessary to change Sinn Féin&#x27;s constitutional opposition to partitionist assemblies. Those defeated in the motion walked out. This resulted in a split into two groups with the Sinn Féin name. Those supportive of Seán Mac Stiofáin&#x27;s &quot;Provisional Army Council&quot;, were referred to in the media as Provisional Sinn Féin, or Sinn Féin Kevin Street, and contested elections as Sinn Féin. The other group, under the leadership of Tomás Mac Giolla, was to contest elections first as Official Sinn Féín, then Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party, and aligned itself with the Official IRA, as the Marxist faction had come to be known. The party retained the historic Sinn Féin headquarters of Gardiner Street, thus giving legitimacy to its claim, in the eyes of some, to be the legitimate successor of that party. It was briefly known popularly as Sinn Féin Gardiner Place.

The Officials were known as the &quot;Stickies&quot; because they sold stick-on lilies to commemorate the Easter Rising. The Provisionals, by contrast, were known as &quot;Pinnies&quot; (pejoratively &quot;Pinheads&quot;) because they produced pinned-on lilies. The term &quot;Stickies&quot; persisted for the Officials, although Pinnies (and Pinheads) disappeared, in favour of the nickname &quot;Provos&quot; and for a time, &quot;Provies&quot; for the Provisional IRA. (The paper-and-pin Easter Lily of the IRA was the traditional commemorative badge of the Easter Rising, whereas the self-adhesive Easter Lily of the Officials was a novel invention, symbolic of the divergence of opinion between them).

== Impact of the split ==
Initially there was much confusion among republicans on the ground; Martin McGuinness for example, joined the Official IRA in 1970, unaware that there had been a split and only later joined the Provisionals. The Provisionals eventually extended their armed campaign from defence of Catholic areas. Despite the reluctance of Cathal Goulding and the OIRA leadership, their volunteers on the ground were inevitably drawn into the violence. The Official IRA&#x27;s first major confrontation with the British Army came in the Falls Curfew of July 1970, when over 3,000 British soldiers raided the Lower Falls area for arms, leading to three days of gun battles. The Official IRA lost a large amount of weaponry, and their members on the ground blamed the Provisionals for starting the firing and then leaving them alone to face the British. The bad feeling left by this and other incidents led to a feud between the two IRAs in 1970, with several shootings carried out by either side. The two IRA factions arranged a truce between them after the OIRA killing of Provisional activist, and Belfast brigade D-Company commander, Charlie Hughes (a cousin of the well-known Provisional Brendan Hughes).

Soviet defector Vasili Mitrokhin alleged in the 1990s that the Goulding leadership sought, in 1969, a small quantity of arms (roughly 70 rifles, along with some hand guns and explosives) from the KGB. The request was approved and the weapons reportedly arrived in Ireland in 1972, although this has not been independently verified. On the whole, the OIRA had a more restricted level of activity than the Provisionals. Unlike the Provisionals, it did not establish &quot;de facto&quot; control over large Catholic areas of Belfast and Derry and its use of force was more defensive. However it retained a strong presence in certain localities, notably the Lower Falls Road, Andersonstown, Turf Lodge and the Markets areas of Belfast, along with a strong presence in Derry (particularly Free Derry in the Bogside area) as well as Newry and South County Down.

==Paramilitary campaign==

While the OIRA occasionally fought the British Army and the RUC throughout 1970 (as well as the Provisional IRA during a 1970 feud), they did not have a strong paramilitary presence until early 1971. In August 1971, after the introduction of internment without trial, OIRA units fought numerous gun battles with British troops who were deployed to arrest suspected republicans. The Official IRA company in the Markets area of Belfast, led by Joe McCann, held off an incursion into the area by over 600 British troops. In December 1971, the Official IRA killed Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Senator John Barnhill at his home in Strabane. This was the first murder of a politician in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland since the assassination of Free State Minister for Justice Kevin O&#x27;Higgins in 1927. In February 1972, the organisation also made an attempt on the life of UUP politician John Taylor.

On Bloody Sunday (30 January 1972), an OIRA man in Derry is believed by the Saville Inquiry to have fired a shot with a revolver at British troops, after they had shot dead 13 civil rights demonstrators the only republican shots fired on the day and contrary to his orders. The anger caused by Bloody Sunday among Irish people was such that the Official IRA announced that it would launch an &quot;offensive&quot; against British forces.

However, the OIRA declared a ceasefire later in the same year. The ceasefire, on 30 May, followed a number of armed actions which had been politically damaging. The organisation bombed the Aldershot headquarters of the Parachute Regiment (the main perpetrators of Bloody Sunday), but killed only six civilians and a Roman Catholic army chaplain. After the killing of William Best, a Catholic British soldier home on leave in Derry, the OIRA declared a ceasefire. In addition, the death of several militant OIRA figures such as Joe McCann in confrontations with British soldiers, enabled the Goulding leadership to call off their armed campaign, which it had never supported wholeheartedly.

== After 1972 ==

Although formally on ceasefire (except for &quot;defensive actions&quot;) since 1972, the Official IRA continued some attacks on British forces up until at least 1976, killing seven British soldiers in what it termed &quot;retaliatory attacks&quot;. In addition, the OIRA&#x27;s weapons were used intermittently in the ongoing feud with the Provisionals. This flared up into violence on several occasions, notably in October 1975. 11 republicans on either side were killed in the feud and a nine-year-old girl was shot dead by the Provisionals when they tried to shoot her father.

In 1974, radical elements within the organisation who objected to the ceasefire, led by Seamus Costello, established the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). Another feud ensued in the first half of 1975, during which three INLA and five OIRA members were killed. The dead included prominent members of both organisations including Costello and the OIRA O/C, Billy McMillen. However, from the mid-1970s onwards, the Official republican movement became increasingly focused on achieving its aims through left-wing constitutional politics. This did not stop sporadic paramilitary activity from the OIRA, who on 8 September 1979 killed Hugh O&#x27;Halloran in a punishment beating in the Ballymurphy area of Belfast. O&#x27; Halloran was beaten to death with a hurley stick and a pickaxe handle. Two men, one of them who admitted to OIRA membership, were imprisoned for his manslaughter. The OIRA lost a number of members who gradually drifted away from the ceasefire up to shortly after the 1981 Hunger Strike, many either joining the Provisional IRA or the INLA or some simply dropping out.

From 1981 on, Sinn Féin the Workers Party, renamed the Workers&#x27; Party the following year, had some success in the Republic of Ireland, but little in Northern Ireland.

Throughout the 1980s, allegations that the Official IRA remained in existence and was engaged in criminal activity appeared in the Irish press. In June 1982 the feud with the INLA flared again after OIRA member James Flynn, the alleged assassin of Seamus Costello, was shot dead by the INLA in Dublin. In December 1985 five men, including Anthony McDonagh, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the Inland Revenue in Northern Ireland—McDonagh was described in court as an Official IRA commander. In February 1992 a British &quot;Spotlight&quot; programme alleged that the Official IRA was still active and involved in widespread racketeering and armed robberies.

In 1990 the OIRA and Provisional IRA came to the brink of a feud twice, following clashes in which members of the two organisations were injured. Allegedly, mediators attempting to defuse the situation said the OIRA were at fault in both incidents.

British security forces were aware of the continued existence of the OIRA; in 1991 a senior RUC source was quoted on a BBC &quot;Spotlight&quot; programme as saying that the Worker&#x27;s Party couldn&#x27;t survive without funding from OIRA criminal activity and the protection the OIRA gave the party against the Provisional IRA. Despite this the Northern Ireland Office continued to receive Workers Party delegations. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) politician Brian Feeney alleged that the OIRA weren&#x27;t interfered with in working-class Nationalist areas of Belfast to keep the Provisional IRA in check.

These eventually proved a considerable political embarrassment to the Workers&#x27; Party, and in 1992 the leadership proposed amendments to the party constitution which would, inter alia, effectively allow it to purge members suspected of involvement in the Official IRA. This proposal failed to obtain the required two-thirds support at the party conference that year, and as a result the leadership, including six of the party&#x27;s seven members of Dáil Éireann, left to establish a new party, later named Democratic Left.

In 1995, some former Official IRA members in the Newry area launched a &quot;re-founded&quot; Official Republican Movement (ORM). This group was believed to have engaged in attacks on drug dealers in the Newry area in the late 1990s. In 1997 violence erupted between the ORM and the IRA; two ORM members and two Sinn Féin supporters were injured in separate gun attacks.

There have been allegations of criminality against former senior Official IRA figure Seán Garland, who was accused in 2005 by the United States of helping to produce and circulate counterfeit US dollars allegedly printed in North Korea.

==Timeline of attacks and actions==
==Decommissioning==
In October 2009, after a long period of inactivity, the Official IRA began talks with a view to decommissioning its stockpile of weapons, and in February 2010 the Newry-based Official Republican Movement announced that it had decommissioned its weapons. The process was confirmed to be completed by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 8 February 2010, coming in the last 24 hours of the commission&#x27;s existence. The decommissioning was completed at the same time as that of the republican INLA and the loyalist UDA South East Antrim Brigade. The step was described by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a &quot;central part of moving Northern Ireland from violence to peace&quot;.

In 2015, it was reported that up to 5,000 Official IRA weapons may still be hidden in secret bunkers. The weapons were supplied to the OIRA in the 1980s by the Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB and North Korea. The report said that the weapons were to be used to defend Catholic areas if there was an outbreak of major sectarian conflict, and that the plan was known only to a few high-ranking members of the organisation.

==Support==

The Official IRA had relations with the Soviet Union during the Troubles. One Irish diplomat in Moscow once wrote that Ireland provided the Soviets with a &quot;convenient stick with which to beat the West.&quot; Assistance from the Soviet Union first occurred in late 1972 when Yuri Andropov who was then the head of the KGB (later to become General Secretary of the Soviet Union) authorized weapons shipments. On 21 August 1972, Andropov had presented a plan known as SPLASH to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It was entitled &quot;Plan for the Operation of a Shipment of Weapons to the Irish Friends&quot;. Two machine guns, 70 automatic rifles, 10 Walther pistols and 41,600 cartridges were sent. The pistols were lubricated with West German oil and the packaging was taken from several countries around the world by KGB agents so that the weapons could not be traced back to the Soviet Union. The weapons were brought to Ireland using the ship known as the Reduktor. Official IRA members also travelled to the Soviet Union for training. North Korea also sent arms to the Officials and taught them with assassination techniques and bomb-making skills. Throughout the 1980s, at least 5,000 weapons were supplied by Soviet and North Korean officials to the OIRA.

In July 1973, Irish Garda discovered eight cases of 17 rifles, 29,000 rounds of ammunition and about 60 pounds of gunpowder in Dublin sent to the OIRA by Canadian citizen John Patrick Murphy. While the Officials tried to gather help from supporters in America, there was little to no evidence of such a thing happening.

==Deaths as a result of activity==
According to Malcolm Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland&quot;, part of the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), the OIRA was responsible for at least 50 killings during the Troubles. According to the book &quot;Lost Lives&quot; (2006 edition), it was responsible for 57 killings.

Of those killed by the OIRA:
*22 (≈44%) were civilians, including 4 civilian political activists
*19 (≈38%) were members or former members of the British security forces, including:
**15 British soldiers and 1 former soldier
**3 RUC officers
*8 (≈16%) were members or former members of Republican paramilitaries
*1 was a UDA member

The CAIN database says there were 27 OIRA members killed during the conflict, while &quot;Lost Lives&quot; says there were 35 killed.

<text>Robot-sumo (Japanese: ロボット相撲) is an engineering and robotics competition in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circular arena, in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo. The robots used in this competition are called &quot;sumo robots&quot;, &quot;sumobots&quot; or simply &quot;sumos&quot;.

Competitions typically involve autonomously operated wheeled mobile robots. The engineering challenges are for the robot to find its opponent (usually accomplished with infrared or ultra-sonic sensors) and to push it out of the dohyō. A robot should also avoid leaving the arena, usually by means of a sensor that detects the edge. The most common mechanical design is to use a wedge with a blade at the front to lift the opposing robot and push it more easily. 
Robot-Sumo originated in Japan in 1989 when FUJISOFT Inc. organized an experimental robot-sumo tournament, which would later be established as the All Japan Robot Sumo Tournament (Japanese: 全日本ロボット相撲大会 zen&#x27;nippon robotto sumou taikai). Since 1998, FUJISOFT has collaborated with more than 30 countries, and robot-sumo has spread and has been one of the most popular robotics competitions in the world, such as in Europe, Mexico and Brazil, with a total of 80,000 people around the world actively developing sumo robots. Currently, the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament is hailed as the &quot;World Robot-Sumo Championship&quot;. 

Although high-performance competitions (events between technical students, universitarians and graduated engineers) require highly complex engineering projects, it is often used as an educational tool for simpler protoypes in schools.

Robot-sumo competitions still hold amateur status, but sumo robots design has been the subject of studies and research in academic environment as well. 

== History ==
Robot-Sumo began in Japan with the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament organized by FUJISOFT Inc. for the first time in 1989 as an experimental tournament, with 33 participants. The first official edition was established in 1990, and, since then, this tournament has been held annually in Tokyo. The competition began with an idea from the president of FUJISOFT Inc., Hiroshi Nozawa, whose goal was to promote his company and recruit excellent human resources. But above all, it was because of his desire to give a dream to the younger people who are responsible for the future of his country, and because of the desire to create an environment to improve the quality of &quot;Monozukuri&quot; in Japan. Initially, Robot Sumo only included the class that would be later known as Mega Sumo or Sumo 3kg class.

In 1992, the FUJISOFT tournament was held at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan, where the tournament is still held today. In 1998, the tournament had 2,929 participants.

Also in 1998, the first Robot-Sumo competition was held outside of Japan, at the ROBOlympics (later renamed RoboGames), one of the largest robotics events at the time, held in the USA. This event helped popularize sumo competitions around the world and led to the creation of categories derived from 3kg class, such as LEGO Sumo, Mini Sumo, among others, which further popularized the category as a whole, leading to the emergence of many competitions around the world, such as in Mexico, Europe, and South America.

In 2004, at the 15th edition of the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament, the tournament introduced the 10kg class, but it would be discontinued in 2007.

In 2008, RoboCore organized the first official national robot-sumo tournament in Brazil as part of the expansion of the national robotics competition &quot;Winter Challenge&quot;, originally a robot combat focused event mainly contested by universitarian teams from the country. In this competition, Sumo 3kg Auto, Sumo 3kg RC and Sumo LEGO classes were held. Until 2019, the Winter or Summer Challenge was the biggest robotics event in Brazil and Latin America, considered the &quot;Brazilian National Robotics Championship&quot; by many.

Also in 2008, with the increasing worldwide popularity of robot-sumo, FUJISOFT held for the first time an edition of the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament with international competitors, from United States, Mexico and Singapore. Since then, the All Japan became a world championship, with the participation of overseas competitors as “Overseas Representatives”.

In 2010, the Robochallenge, in Romania, hosted a robot-sumo event for the first time. 

In 2013, FUJISOFT held the first official edition of the International Robot-Sumo Tournament (Japanese: 世界大会 sekai taikai), separating from the Japanese national All Japan competition (Japanese: 全国大会 zenkoku taikai), with only the best Japanese (champions, and later runners-up) advancing to the world tournament, with both tournaments being held in the same day, in sequence. In this edition, tournament champions or national representatives from Austria, USA, Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Turkey, Mexico and Ecuador participated as overseas representatives. The Auto tournament had 16 robots, and the RC tournament, 8 robots, in 2013.

Between 2013 and 2017, without a massive number of Japanese robots (and with a higher number of non-Japanese robots, with some editions reaching more than 100 robots in a single class),non-Japanese international competitors achieved greater results in the International Tournament. European teams achieved significant results in the 3kg Auto class, including top places and championship titles. In 2017, the last edition of the International Robot-Sumo Tournament was marked by Mexican dominance in the Mega Sumo RC class, taking the first three positions and ahead of the Japanese champions.In 2018, FUJISOFT reunified the Japanese All Japan competition with the International Tournament into a single tournament, as it was before 2013, retaining the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament name and labeling the final stage as the &quot;Grand Final&quot;. In 2019, the competition was in its 31st edition, and had the participation of more than 20 countries, 104 autonomous robots and 78 radio-controlled robots in the Grand Final. With the competition unified again, robots from Japan once again dominated the top positions of the competition in 2018 and 2019.

In 2019, FUJISOFT also organized the first Mini-Sumo event in Japan, as a test event (called pre-tournament) in All Japan, only for Auto category. 

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the 2020 edition (32nd edition) of the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament was cancelled. 

In Brazil, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, competitions were also canceled. In response, many teams began organizing remote competitions, in which participants controlled ready-made prototypes provided by the organization remotely through the internet. For the Robot Sumo category, the most popular was the Remote Mini Sumo RC class, in which participants controlled ready-made robots just like in a conventional competition, but remotely through the internet with a mobile phone application. These competitions attracted not only Brazilian competitors, but also international competitors such as Argentines and Indians.

In 2021 and 2022, FUJISOFT organized an alternative competition for the 32nd and 33rd editions remotely for high school competitors (Japanese: 高校学校 koukougakkou), which consisted of a sumo robot design contest.

In 2022, RoboCore from Brazil remodeled its main and largest robotics competition, the &quot;Winter Challenge&quot;, into the &quot;RoboCore Experience&quot; (RCX), the largest robot combat event in Latin America. The competition hosts the Mega Sumo, Mini Sumo and LEGO Sumo tournaments, jointly with the Robot Combat, Line Follower, Robot Hockey, Robot Trekking, ArtBot and Robot Soccer competitions. The RoboCore Experience is held together with Campus Party Brazil. The 2023 RCX had 1330 registered competitors and almost 700 robots in all robotics categories.

In 2022, with the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, FUJISOFT once again organized the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament (34th edition), but only for local competitors. In the same event, a new pre-tournament for Mini Sumo class was organized by FUJISOFT. 

In 2023, All Japan, in its 35th edition, returned qualifying participants from overseas competitions for Mega Sumo class, for the first time since 2019. This year, the Mini Sumo tournament was officially added to the All Japan, but only for japanese competitors.

In 2024, the robot Senju, from the Sumozade-Era Robotics team from Turkey, became the first non-Japanese Mega Sumo champion of the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament since the reunification in 2018, winning in the Auto category. Also in 2024, the Mini Sumo of All Japan started qualifying overseas competitors as well. Brazilian teams achieved great success, making the Mini Sumo Auto final, and also taking 2nd and 3rd places in Mini Sumo RC in that year. 

==Rules and Classes==
The principle of a robot-sumo fight consists of two robots competing to push the opponent out of the dohyō. The arena is usually painted with a main color with a contrasting color used to paint a line in the edge (usually, black as the main color and white as the border line color).

Robot-sumo is usually divided in Autonomous (Auto) category, for robots that operate autonomously, and Radio-controlled (RC) category, for robots operated by a person.

Matches are typically a series of 3 rounds, with the winner being the one who gets the most round wins. A round usually consists of (1) Positioning, (2) Preparation, and (3) Fight proper. In initial Positioning, a judge signals each operator to position each robot at the same time within the competition&#x27;s permitted positioning limits. The judge then allows each operator to Prepare to select routines and strategies (in the case of the Auto category) or prepare the remote control (in the case of the RC category). To begin the Fight proper, the judge signals the start of the round according to the competition rules, and the winner of the round is the robot that pushes the opponent out of the arena. In the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament, the judge, at the start of a fight, usually announces &quot;Hakkeyoi nokotta&quot; (はっきよい 残った), which can be imprecisely translated as &quot;Ready? Go!&quot;.

In general, the rules may vary in some details from tournament to tournament (arena specifications, starting positioning, handling of exceptions, ...) especially in tournaments of a more educational nature, held in educational institutions as a didactic activity. High level competitions tend to follow standardized rules, such as the rules from All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament.For example, FUJISOFT requires the usage of a standardized remote controller for the judge in Autonomous category in the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament and in its qualifiers Overseas Tournaments, so the judge may control the start and the stop of the robots&#x27; movements. This remote controller uses infrared light with the following specifications: wavelength of 950 nm, service frequency: 38-40 kHz, and any Sony brand remote control can be used for the signal. The activation process works with 3 states: Key 1: Ready; Key 2: Start; Key 3: Stop.

Competitions are usually divided into different weight and size classes. The main standardized classes adopted worldwide are Mega Sumo and Mini Sumo. Though classes have size limits, robots are usually allowed to expand once the fight starts.

=== Mega Sumo ===
Mega Sumo, also called Standard Class, Sumo 3kg class, or simply Robot-Sumo, is the original class created by FUJISOFT. It is currently the most important class and considered the main event of robot sumo competitions.In this class, robots are limited in weight to 3 kg and in dimensions to 20 cm x 20 cm, with no height limit. Once the fight starts, the robot is allowed to expand its dimensions.

In this class, the dohyō should ideally be a 5cm in height circular aluminum structure with a diameter of 154 cm (+/- 50 mm), including the border line, and covered by a black cold-rolled steel (SPCC) sheet located on top. The dohyō is made of steel, and the use of magnets is allowed to increase the interaction force between the robot and the arena. Because of this, many robots can achieve normal force values that surpass 100 kgf.

This class is usually divided in Mega Sumo Auto (Autonomous) and Mega Sumo RC (Radio-controlled).

=== Mini Sumo ===
In the Mini Sumo class (also called Sumo 500g class) robots have a weight limit of up to 500 g and are limited to 10 cm x 10 cm, with no height limit. Once the fight starts, the robot is allowed to expand its size.The dohyō should be a 2.5 cm in height circular wooden board with a diameter of 77 cm (including the white border line), covered by a formica laminate located on top. The arena is made of wood, and therefore the robots are not affected by the force of magnets.

This class is also usually divided in Mini Sumo Auto (Autonomous) and Mini Sumo RC (Radio-controlled). Not an original class from All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament, the class was added to the event as of 2019, officially introducing the mini sumo in Japan. 

Because a Mini robot is more affordable than a 3kg robot (due to material costs and manufacturing dimensions), it is a more popular class and often considered entry-level. Because of this, it has become the most popular robot sumo class in the world.

=== Other Standard Classes ===
There are also other standardized classes in different competitions around the world.
* Sumo 10 kg class: up to 10 kg, dimensions of 30 cm x 30 cm, no height limit, steel arena. Class hosted between 2004 and 2007 by All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament, but currently discontinued.
* Micro Sumo: up to 100 g, must fit in a 5 cm cube, wooden arena.
* Nano Sumo: up to 50 g, must fit in a 2.5 cm cube, wooden arena.
* LEGO Sumo: robots must be made entirely of Lego pieces, wooden arena.
The Micro and Nano classes are less popular than the Mini and Mega Sumo, but they are held at some relevant events such as RoboGames, RobotChallenge in China, and Robochallenge in Romania.

In the LEGO Sumo class, robots must be made entirely of Lego pieces. This class is widely used as an educational tool in schools for teaching robotics.
=== Minor Variants ===
Minor regional competitions might host their own classes as well. Internal competitions in schools might also create their own variants for didatic purposes.

There are also some robot-sumo events with humanoid robots.

==== Humanoid robot-sumo ====
Humanoid robot-sumo is similar to ROBO-ONE events. The robots are generally radio-controlled with some degree of autonomy. The mains robotics events with humanoid robot-sumo featured are the RoboGames, the chinese RobotChallenge, and the romanian Robochallenge. 

Since this variant involves humanoid robots, it does not follow the same principles of design from the robot-sumo created by FUJISOFT for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament. This category also does not have the same prestige as the wheeled standard robot-sumo classes, such as Mega Sumo and Mini Sumo.

== Robot design ==
Standard sumo robots resemble car-like robots, consisting of a chassis with wheels, and usually equipped with sensors, when with some level of autonomy. The use of mechanisms that physically damage the opposing robot is not usually permitted. For majority of the classes, mainly Mega Sumo and Mini Sumo, a robot design project is usually divided in three disciplines: Mechanics, Electronics, and Programming. 

Competitors are encouraged to build their own robots, respecting each competition class&#x27; and security rules. In Sumo LEGO, in particular, only Lego pieces must be used to build the robot, mainly using Mindstorms NXT or Mindstorms EV3 robotics kits. 

A lot of projects employs electronics components and mechanical parts sold in robotics stores. With the popularization of standardized robot-sumo competitions worldwide, mainly Mega Sumo and Mini Sumo, specialized robot-sumo parts stores appeared, such as JSumo and Sumozade, both based in Turkey, which even sell complete Mega Sumo and Mini Sumo robot kits.

=== Mechanics ===
The Mechanics consists in the infrastructure that supports and accommodates all the components and systems of the sumobot, including motors, wheels, PCB&#x27;s, sensors, among others.

A standard sumo robot is wheeled driven robot with a locomotion system. The locomotion system usually consists of driving motors with a coupling system to the wheels, which usually employs a reduction drive system to shift the output speed. Brushed DC motors have been the most employed ones, but there are also robots with brushless DC motors. Motors from Maxon or Faulhaber brands have been popular choices among highest level competitors, such as robots in the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament.

Another commonly employed design for a sumo robot is an angled wedge/ramp in the front of the body. This wedge is usually coupled with a blade with the purpose of invading the opponent from below and lifting it, so it becomes easier to push it out of the arena. 

For Mega Sumo robots, since magnets play an important role in the dynamics performance, the chassis are usually designed to support the desired number of magnets. A builder might choose between a heavier or a lighter robot based on the number of magnets allocated.

Some robot designs also employs peripheral mechanisms. Though classes have dimension limits, they are usually limited to the start of the fight, and once the fight starts, the robot is allowed to expand its size. Examples of these mechanisms are side flags and side wedges, which are usually activated with actuators other than the driving motors.
=== Electronics ===
In a sumo robot, Electronics may be divided in two main functions: power supply and logic control. Sumo robots, in general, employ Lithium polymer batteries to supply energy to the motors and other electronic components.

Microcontrollers are mainly employed to receive data from sensors and send command to the motors and other actuators based on the programmed control logic. Microcontrollers are usually mounted with a designed PCB for the robot.

In Autonomous classes, infrared sensors or ultrasonic sensors are usually employed to detect the opponent. Sumos also employ sensors to detect the edge (border line), usually with phototransistor reflectance sensors.

In RC classes, the robots are remotely controlled by an operator. All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament usually require radio controllers, so the robot hardware must be able to receive commands from the controller using a radio signal receiver module.

=== Programming ===
The Programming discipline is responsible for the embbeded control system, mainly in the autonomous classes. A robot-sumo firmware is responsible monitoring the sensors&#x27; data and for controlling the actuators, such as the driving motors.

The robot control system consists in setting the behaviour of the actuators (mainly the motors) based on the feedback of the sensors. Some usual control routines include setting a behaviour while no opponent is detected, such as randomly advancing through the dohyō, and a behaviour when an opponent is detected, such as pursuing it based on the feedback of the detection sensors.

== Tournaments ==
Currently, several Robot-Sumo tournaments are held around the world. Robot-sumo competitions range from simple didatic and educational tournaments within schools to the highest level engineering competitions between high school/university students, graduate engineers and hobbyists.

Competitors are usually organized into teams, consisting of the sumo robots themselves and the members responsible for their creation, operation and maintenance during the event. Robot-sumo tournaments still have amateur status (students and hobbyists), even though some teams from academic institutions might be guided or leaded by a professor from the institute, with this advisoring being commonly included as part of his academic activities.

Competitions adopt different competition formats, usually knockout bracket competitions, ranging from single elimination systems to tournaments with group stage or double elimination systems. Teams may register more than one robot per event, and confrontations between robots from the same team are possible.

As for the highest level competitions, Japan is the world&#x27;s leading powerhouse in this category, and the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament is the most prestigious competition in the world, being considered as the &quot;World Robot-Sumo Championship&quot;. Originally a tournament for Japan-based builders, FUJISOFT currently approves several tournaments around the world as certified overseas qualifiers for international competitors.

In Japan, a large portion of the top competitors come from school teams from secondary school, with tournaments being exclusively held for them. Furthermore, the high school regional qualifiers make up a significant portion of the japanese slots for the All Japan Grand Final. In 2024, 66 of the 114 slots for japanese competitors were reserved for high schooler&#x27;s robots.

Also in Asia, there are also important competitions in China, such as the RobotChallenge, and in Mongolia.

In Europe, the RoboChallenge, in Romania, is the main european robot-sumo event, focused mainly on autonomous sumo. Baltic States also organize relevant competitions, such as Robotex.

In the Americas, the former RoboGames, the largest robotics competition in the world at the time, included several Sumo categories in its program, bringing together international competitors from all over the world. Mexico, one of the world powerhouses, especially in Mega Sumo RC and Mini Sumo, hosts several robot-sumo competitions. In Brazil, RoboCore hosts and sanctions the main robot competitions of the country, mainly for Robot Combat, but which usually include Robot-Sumo and other events such as Line Follower as well.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, Robot-Sumo is officially sanctioned by FUJISOFT Inc., which organizes the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament, the first robot-sumo competition, since 2008 the world&#x27;s leading competition with robots from over 20 countries participating, and currently, considered as the &quot;World Robot-Sumo Championship&quot;.

Robot-sumo in Japan is also particularly popular among students from the secondary school. There are two main tournaments for high schooler&#x27;s builders: the High Schooler&#x27;s Robot-Sumo Tournament, organized by FUJISOFT, and the High School Robot-Sumo Championship, organized by AEON Mall, with the support of FUJISOFT, which are also qualifiers to the All Japan Tournament. 

==== All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament ====
The All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament (Japanese: 全日本ロボット相撲大会 zen&#x27;nippon robotto sumou taikai) was founded in 1989 by FUJISOFT Inc.. It is considered as the &quot;World Robot-Sumo Championship&quot; for Mega Sumo, both Auto and RC. Since 2023, it has also been officially hosting Mini-Sumo competitions (Auto and RC). 

The competition is divided into a &quot;Regional Stage&quot; (Japanese: 地区大会 chiku taikai, lit: regional tournament) and the &quot;Grand Final&quot; (Japanese: 全国大会 zenkoku taikai, lit: all country tournament), also called &quot;Final Round&quot;. The Regional Stage consists of regional tournaments held in Japan between August and October for participants based in Japan, with the top performers from each tournament qualifying for the Grand Final. The Regional Stage tournaments have usually been the Kantō, Chūgoku-Shikoku, Hokushin&#x27;etsu-Tōkai, Tōhoku, Hokkaidō, Kinki and Kyūshū tournaments, though not all of them may be held every edition. The Regional Stage tournaments currently adopt a single-elimination format and are held in a single day. 

The FUJISOFT&#x27;s &quot;High Schooler&#x27;s Tournament&quot; and the &quot;High School Championship&quot; Regional Stage tournaments are also part of regional qualifiers for the All Japan Grand Final. 

International representatives may qualify for the Grand Final through international qualifiers tournaments approved by FUJISOFT, in overseas countries such as Mexico, Mongolia and Brazil, among others. These tournaments form the &quot;Overseas Tournaments&quot; qualifiers (Japanese: 海外大会枠 kaigai taikai-waku, lit: overseas tournaments slots). The Overseas Tournaments are run by different organizations, so the tournament format varies. 

In some specific cases, qualification certificates are also issued to some teams as &quot;National Representative&quot;, for countries with no teams yet qualified or without any official qualifier tournament. 

The Grand Final is held in December in Tokyo, Japan at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan, and is held in two days, with the first day labeled &quot;Qualification Session&quot; and the final day as the &quot;Grand Final Session&quot; properly. The Grand Final is also a single-elimination knockout tournament. 

As of 2024, FUJISOFT initially reserved for each of Mega Sumo categories, Auto and RC, a total of 57 slots for the Regional Stage (including the &quot;High Schooler&#x27;s Tournament&quot; and the &quot;High School Championship&quot; Regional Stage tournaments) and 40 slots for Overseas Tournaments for the All Japan Grand Final. While all japanese slots were filled, only 26 and 23 slots were filled by overseas representatives for Auto and RC, respectively. That edition had robots from 17 overseas countries qualified. 

==== High Schooler&#x27;s Robot-Sumo Tournament ====
FUJISOFT also organizes the &quot;High Schooler&#x27;s Robot-Sumo Tournament&quot; (Japanese: 高校生ロボット相撲大会 kōkōsei robotto sumou taikai). The tournament is exclusive for robots developed by students from secondary education in Japan (equivalent to high school) held in parallel with the main All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament. Like the main All Japan, while initially a Mega Sumo tournament only, the event currently also hosts Mini Sumo tournaments.

The tournament also consists of Regional Stage tournaments and a Final tournament, with the Regional Stage tournament being usually held jointly with the All Japan Regional Stage tournaments in the same day, while the Final High Schooler&#x27;s tournament is usually held separately and earlier, in a different venue. The tournaments also adopt single-elimination format, with the final tournament with 32 robots in each Mega Sumo Auto and RC categories.

The Regional Stage tournaments are also usual qualifiers for the main All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament Grand Final.

==== High School Robot-Sumo Championship ====
AEON Mall, with the support of FUJISOFT, organizes the &quot;High School Robot-Sumo Championship&quot; (Japanese: 高等学校ロボット相撲選手権 kōtō gakkō robotto sumou senshuken), which is also exclusive to students from secondary education. Initially a Mega Sumo tournament, the event currently also hosts Mini Sumo class tournaments.

The tournament consists of Regional Stage tournaments only, usually hosted in AEON Mall shopping centres from each host region.

These Regional Stage tournaments are also usual qualifiers for the main All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament Grand Final.

=== Brazil ===
Widely known for robot combat competitions, robot-sumo was introduced in Brazil by RoboCore in 2008 and has attained increasing attention in the country from 2017 onwards, mainly from teams from the top universities of the country. In particular, robot-sumo has been added to the main robotics competitions contested by teams of engineering and technology students from institutes at Technical and mainly at Higher Education levels. The robotics teams from the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (Poli-USP, with their team named ThundeRatz), Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) are among the most prominent robot-sumo competitors in the country. These competitions are also open to teams not directly linked with academic institutions, including independent teams of hobbyists, graduated engineers and professionals. These teams are often made up of former students from those academic institutions teams.

Furthermore, international teams, from countries such as Ecuador, France, Mexico, Paraguay and Poland, have already participated. Participants from Mexico, one of the robot-sumo world powerhouses, have achieved great success in competitions in Brazil, mainly in Mini Sumo.

==== RoboCore ====
RoboCore is an online store, developer and manufacturer of boards and kits in Brazil and an organizer of robotics events. RoboCore organizes and supports a number of robotics competitions in Brazil, including in its program Robot Combat, Line Follower, Robot Trekking and Robot-Sumo events, attracting mainly universitarian and technical education level teams. The current major RoboCore robotics competition in general is the RoboCore Experience (RCX, and former Winter/Summer Challenge), the largest robot combat competition in Latin America, currently held with Campus Party Brasil. 

Annual calendar competitions from RoboCore with robot-sumo added to their program are the following:

* RoboCore Experience (RCX): organized by RoboCore, currently held with Campus Party Brasil, mainly at São Paulo - SP.
* IRONCup: organized by Inatel and sanctioned by RoboCore, held at Santa Rita do Sapucaí - MG.
* RSM Challenge: organized by Instituto RSM and sanctioned by RoboCore, held at Mogi das Cruzes - SP, in the Greater São Paulo.
* RoboChallenge Brasil: organized by Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia and sanctioned by RoboCore, held at São Caetano do Sul - SP, in the Greater São Paulo.

The robot-sumo competitions organized or supported by RoboCore are among the most prestigious in the country. RoboCore Experience is the major robotics event in Brazil and considered by many as the brazilian &quot;National Championship&quot;. However, the IRONCup, the RSM Challenge and the RoboChallenge Brasil have also become prominent competitions due to their relevance to the national robot-sumo scenario. Besides these events, some special and once a time competitions might be organized as well.

The classes usually included in RoboCore tournaments program are Sumo 3kg (Mega Sumo) Auto and RC, Mini Sumo Auto and RC and LEGO Sumo. In addition, there is usually a separate LEGO Sumo class exclusively for teams formed by elementary and high school students, the LEGO Sumo Junior.

RoboCore tournaments usually adopt the double-elimination knockout system, in which there is a main bracket (called the &quot;winners&#x27; bracket&quot;) and a secondary bracket of robots transferred after losing a match in the main bracket (called the &quot;losers&#x27; bracket&quot;). Robots that lose in the losers bracket are eliminated from the tournament. The tournament final consists of the winner of the winners&#x27; bracket competing against the remaining robot from the losers&#x27; bracket. Robot-sumo tournaments from RoboCore usually adopt a &quot;double final&quot; format, in which the robot coming from the losers&#x27; bracket must win two matches of the final to become the tournament champion, while the robot coming from the winners&#x27; bracket must win only one match. This is due to the principle that for a robot to be eliminated, it must suffer two defeats in the event. 

RoboCore calendar robot-sumo events (RCX, IRONCup, RSM Challenge and Robochallenge) have been usually approved by FUJISOFT as Overseas Tournaments qualifiers for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament in the Mega Sumo and Mini Sumo classes. Thus, these competitions are the main qualification path for teams based in Brazil.

RoboCore also organizes the &quot;RoboCore&#x27;s Robot History Ranking&quot;, a historical ranking of registered and participant robots in RoboCore tournaments, including those in the robot-sumo classes. The system is based on the Elo system that calculates the relative strength between opponents based on the result of each confrontation. The RoboCore system adopts an initial score of 1200, but does not exclude inactive robots from the ranking. Since the system is tied to a registered robot, then the ranking is compiled exclusively for each instance registered in the system (this means if a robot is registered with different labels for different tournaments, the ranking will be compiled for each label, as different robots). For robot-sumo, the RoboCore ranking is compiled for the major classes in Brazil: Sumo 3kg Auto, 3kg RC, Mini Auto, Mini RC, LEGO and LEGO Jr., but also for minor classes, such as the remote classes, popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== Other tournaments in Brazil ====
Though RoboCore organizes and sanctions a number of events, most of them are hosted in the Southeast region of Brazil, mainly in the São Paulo state. Different academic institutions have also been organizing regional tournaments, mainly in the Northeast and South regions of Brazil.

From 2017 until 2021, Instituto Mauá also organized additional tournaments in São Paulo state in partnership with SESC, from Santo André in the Greater São Paulo, and with Bosch Brazil in Campinas - SP. These tournaments were also added as Overseas Tournament qualifiers for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament.

=== China ===
China hosts the RobotChallenge.

==== RobotChallenge ====
The RobotChallenge is &quot;one of the world’s largest artificial intelligent robotic championships&quot; and had the participation of more than 80 countries through the years. The competitions hosts a number of robotics competition such as Air Race, Line Follower, Humanoid Sprint and RoboSumo (Robot-Sumo). 

For Robot-sumo, the competition organizes tournaments for Mega Sumo, Mini Sumo, Micro Sumo, Nano Sumo and Lego Sumo classes. There is also a special class for Humanoid Sumo.

RobotChallenge is also a usual Overseas Tournament qualifier for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament. 

=== Mexico ===
Mexico hosts a number of robot-sumo events. The prominent ones are usual approved Overseas Tournaments qualifiers for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament.

=== Mongolia ===
Mongolia hosts a number of robot-sumo events. The prominent ones are usual approved Overseas Tournaments qualifiers for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament.

=== Romania ===
Romania hosts the Robochallenge.

==== Robochallenge ====
Robochallenge was first organized in 2008, and initially called ROBOT FOTBAL, hosting a Robot Football competition. It currently organizes tournaments of Line Follower, Robot Football, Maze, Robot Combat and Robot-Sumo, among others. The competition is held at Politehnica of Bucharest. 

As of 2024, the robot-sumo classes hosted by Robochallenge Romania are Mega Sumo, Mini Sumo, Micro Sumo, Nano Sumo. It also organizes a Humanoid Sumo competition.

Robochallenge is an also usual Overseas Tournament qualifier for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament. 

=== United States of America ===
The RoboGames is held in the USA, which was, until 2016, the largest open robotics competition in the world. 

==== RoboGames ====

RoboGames is an international robot event contested annually in the USA. The events are divided in categories: Humanoids; Auton. Humanoid Challenges; Combat; Robot Soccer; Open; Jr League; Autonomous Autos; Art Bots; BEAM, and Sumo. It hosted the first robot-sumo event outside Japan, in 1998. 

As of 2024, RoboGames opened registrations for the following robot-sumo events: Nano 25g (auton), Micro 100g (auton), Mini 500g (auton), Mini 500g (junior class), 1kg (kit-auton), Mega 3kg (R/C), Mega 3kg (auton), 4kg (Humanoid). 

RoboGames is an also usual Overseas Tournament qualifier for the All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament. 

== In the media ==
The popular internet meme &quot;Omae wa mou shindeiru&quot; (お前はもう死んでいる, English: You are already dead), from Japanese manga series &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, has been adapted to robot-sumo fight videos and became viral. A video uploaded on YouTube in 2017 by the user &quot;Sh0gun&quot;, named &quot;*teleports behind you*&quot;, has gathered more than 63 million visualizations.

In 2018, Japanese robot-sumo has been the subject of a short video from Great Big Story named &quot;The Freakishly Fast World of Robot Sumo&quot; released on YouTube.

Since 2019, FUJISOFT has been live transmitting the Regional Stage and the Grand Final tournaments of All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament on a dedicated Youtube channel.

<text>A circumfix (abbr: ) (also parafix, confix, or ambifix) is an affix which has two parts, one placed at the start of a word, and the other at the end. Circumfixes contrast with prefixes, attached to the beginnings of words; suffixes, attached at the end; and infixes, inserted in the middle. Circumfixes are common in Malay and Georgian.

Its related operation is called circumfixation (or parafixation, confixation, ambifixation).

== Examples ==

 are used to mark off circumfixes. 

===Germanic languages===
The circumfix is probably most widely known from the German past participle, which is &quot;ge-&quot;&quot;-t&quot; (ge- prefix + -t suffix) for regular verbs. The verb &quot;spiel-en&quot;, for example, has the participle &quot;ge-spiel-t&quot;. However, a number of so-called &quot;strong&quot; verbs display the suffix &quot;-en&quot; (&quot;ge-sung-en&quot; &#x27;sung&#x27;), while all verbs carrying non-initial stress come without the prefix part &quot;ge-&quot;, as in &quot;telefonier-t&quot; &#x27;telephoned&#x27;.

Dutch has a similar system (&quot;spel-en&quot; → &quot;ge-speel-d&quot; in this case). In Dutch, the circumfix &quot;ge-&quot;&quot;-te&quot; (ge- prefix + -te suffix) can be used to form certain collective nouns (&quot;berg&quot; (mountain) → &quot;ge-berg-te&quot; (mountain range)).

===East Asian languages===
In Japanese, some linguists consider &quot;o--ni naru&quot; (o- honorific prefix + ni particle + verb naru) and &quot;o--suru&quot; (o- prefix + -suru suffix/verb suru) to be honorific circumfixes; for example &quot;yom-u&quot; (′read′) ...→ &quot;o--ni naru&quot; (respectful), &quot;o--suru&quot; (humble).

In addition, Old Japanese had a prohibitive construction &quot;na--so2(ne)&quot; (where the bracketed &quot;ne&quot; is optional), which at least one linguist (ja) considers to be a circumfixal word form; an example using the Old Japanese verb ′write′ (&quot;kak-u&quot;) would be &quot;na--so2(ne)&quot;. The form without the bracketed &quot;ne&quot; survived marginally into Early Middle Japanese, but has no equivalent in any modern Japanese dialect or any other Japonic language. Instead, all modern Japonic languages and dialects express the prohibitive with a &quot;suffixal&quot; particle &quot;na&quot; (which is probably related to the prefixal part of the Old Japanese construction) attached to a non-past form of the verb; e.g., Tōkyō Japanese &quot;ku-na&quot;, Kyōto Japanese &quot;ka-na&quot;, Kagoshima Japanese &quot;kaʔ-&quot; or &quot;kan-&quot;, Hachijō &quot;kaku-na&quot;, Yamatohama Amami &quot;kʰakʰu-na&quot;, Nakijin Kunigami &quot;hḁkˀu:-&quot;, Shuri Okinawan &quot;&quot;, Irabu Miyakoan &quot;kafï-na&quot;, Hateruma Yaeyaman &quot;hḁku-na&quot;, and Yonaguni &quot;kʰagu-n-na&quot; (all ′don&#x27;t write!′). In addition to the circumfixal forms, Old Japanese also had a suffixal form similar to the modern forms (e.g., &quot;kak-u-na&quot;), as well as a &quot;prefixal&quot; form &quot;na-kak-i1&quot;, which is also not reflected in any modern Japonic variety.

===Austronesian languages===
Malay has eight circumfixes:
: &quot;per-&quot;&quot;-kan&quot;
: &quot;per-&quot;&quot;-i&quot;
: &quot;ber-&quot;&quot;-an&quot;
: &quot;ke-&quot;&quot;-an&quot;
: &quot;pen-&quot;&quot;-an&quot;
: &quot;per-&quot;&quot;-an&quot;
: &quot;se-&quot;&quot;-nya&quot;
: &quot;ke-&quot;&quot;-i&quot;

For example, the circumfix &quot;ke-&quot;&quot;-an&quot; can be added to the root &quot;adil&quot; &quot;fair/just&quot; to form &quot;ke-adil-an&quot; &quot;fairness/justice&quot;.

===Other languages===
In most North African and some Levantine varieties of Arabic, verbs are negated by placing the circumfix &quot;ma&quot;&quot;š&quot; around the verb together with all its prefixes and suffixed direct- and indirect-object pronouns. For example, Egyptian &quot;bitgibuhum-laha&quot; &quot;you bring them to her&quot; is negated as &quot;maš&quot; &quot;you don&#x27;t bring them to her&quot;.

In Berber languages the feminine is marked with the circumfix &quot;t&#x27;t&quot;. The word &quot;afus&quot; &quot;hand&quot; becomes &quot;t&#x27;t&quot;. In Kabyle, &quot;θ&#x27;θ&quot; &quot;bride&quot; derives from &quot;issli&quot; &quot;groom&quot;. From &quot;bni&quot;, to build, with &quot;t&#x27;t&quot; we obtain &quot;tbnit&quot; &quot;thou buildest&quot;. 

Negation in Guaraní is also done with circumfixes, &quot;nd&#x27;i&quot; and &quot;nd&#x27;mo&#x27;ãi&quot; for future negation.

In some Slavic languages, and in Hungarian, the superlative of adjectives is formed with a circumfix. For example, in Czech, the circumfix &quot;nej&#x27;ší&quot; is used – &quot;mladý&quot; &quot;young&quot; becomes &quot;nejmladší&quot; &quot;youngest&quot;. The corresponding circumfix in Hungarian is &quot;leg&#x27;bb&quot;, as in &quot;legnagyobb&quot; &quot;biggest&quot;, from &quot;nagy&quot; &quot;big&quot;. (In both cases, the comparative form is produced using the suffix without the prefix: &quot;mladší&quot; &quot;younger&quot;; &quot;nagyobb&quot; &quot;bigger&quot;.) 

In Gurmanchema and Wolof, noun classes are indicated by circumfix.

<text>John Redcorn III is a fictional character from the Fox animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. He is invariably addressed or referred to as &quot;John Redcorn&quot; or &quot;Mr. Redcorn&quot; by every character in the series, and is never addressed or referred to simply as &quot;John&quot;.

== Character biography ==
A former roadie for Winger and &quot;Licensed New Age Healer&quot;, John Redcorn is Nancy Hicks-Gribble&#x27;s Native American masseur, her lover of 14 years (the two split up during the show&#x27;s fourth season), and the biological father of her son Joseph Gribble. Both Nancy&#x27;s husband Dale Gribble and Joseph are completely unaware of this, despite the fact that it is obvious to everyone else in the neighborhood, the main reason for this being the amount of time John Redcorn spends with Nancy and the close resemblance between Joseph and John Redcorn. John Redcorn has a sister, whom Nancy assumed told everyone about their affair. A recurring gag is that whenever Dale makes a comment about being Joseph&#x27;s father, John Redcorn shows up. In season 5, episode 4, it is implied that John Redcorn is Puebloan, as the &quot;Anasazi&quot; are referenced as his ancestors, although the ancestors of modern Puebloans did not inhabit Texas.

In episode 38 (season 3, episode 3), Peggy Hill, still oblivious to the relationship between John Redcorn and Nancy, goes to him for help with a headache. When her husband, series protagonist Hank Hill, confronts Redcorn, Redcorn says he would never &quot;heal&quot; Peggy the way he heals &quot;the wives of others&quot;, implying that he has slept with many other married women.

John Redcorn drives a tan Jeep Wrangler and becomes the lead singer of the band Big Mountain Fudgecake, for which Lucky Kleinschmidt plays guitar and Dale is briefly the manager. John Redcorn has had a long-time desire to be a professional musician. The band isn&#x27;t very good, and after it doesn&#x27;t take off, it breaks up. Dale re-works John Redcorn&#x27;s image as a performer of children&#x27;s songs and establishes him as &quot;The Native American Raffi&quot;, as Dale puts it. John Redcorn begins singing toned-down solo acoustic children&#x27;s versions of his songs at the Strickland company barbecue and becomes instantly popular. It was revealed that Big Mountain Fudgecake got back together near the end of the episode &quot;Earthly Girls are Easy&quot;. When driving, he is often heard playing Pat Benatar songs, including the hits &quot;Hit Me With Your Best Shot&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. He is also notable for playing music from the band Foreigner, such as &quot;Hot Blooded&quot; and &quot;Double Vision&quot;.

John Redcorn is often seen reading a book about Native American rights in North America, entitled &quot;This Land is Our Land&quot;. A recurring gag is that when he begins speaking about matters related to Native traditions and their spiritual meanings, his long black hair is dramatically whisked up in a breeze. Despite his dedication to his heritage, it has sometimes backfired on him. When Bobby Hill becomes interested in Native American rights, Redcorn seems pleased (although his original intention was to get Joseph interested in his heritage). However, Bobby discovers that Redcorn&#x27;s ancestors engaged in cannibalism, which then causes a mortified John Redcorn to have to explain to everyone how that practice was discontinued centuries ago.

As a recurring gag, Dale sees several signs of the affair but always draws the wrong conclusions. On one occasion, he finds him trying to sneak inside to have sex with Nancy but thinks he is trying to steal his mower; when Dale reports having a vision of a Native American making love with his wife and Joseph (in full Native American ceremonial garb) being handed to him, he then assumes that means he is part Native American himself; when John Redcorn says straight to a TV camera that &quot;I slept with Hank&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s wife for 13 years&quot; with Dale inches away, Dale thinks he means Bill Dauterive&#x27;s wife and not his. John Redcorn&#x27;s access to Nancy is caused primarily by Dale ignorantly allowing him to be her masseur and often trusting her to him to keep her away from other men who may have affairs with her. It is revealed in Season 6 that Dale believes John Redcorn to be gay, which partially explains his contentment with letting him be alone with his wife so often.

John Redcorn has a predictably difficult relationship with Dale; though he considers him a good man, he is jealous of his relationship with Nancy and Joseph, and exasperated by how Dale&#x27;s eccentricities influence Joseph. He seems depressed that he was not more of a father to Joseph, which is later partially resolved when Nancy reveals to Joseph that since they all are &quot;from the Earth&quot;, John Redcorn and Joseph are in fact related. In &quot;Nancy Boys&quot;, after Dale helps him with a lawsuit against the Federal government, Redcorn calls Dale &quot;a true friend&quot; and cites this as a reason for agreeing to split up with Nancy; he made a similar comment to Hank regarding Peggy in an earlier episode. However, later in the series in the episode &quot;Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot;, he would (unsuccessfully) attempt to reconnect with Nancy.

John Redcorn and Joseph are especially estranged. Whenever John Redcorn tries to engage Joseph and introduce him to Native American practices and rituals, Joseph doesn&#x27;t show any interest. John Redcorn shows special interest in forging a real bond in &quot;Spin The Choice&quot;, to no avail—until Nancy takes Joseph aside and sets him straight. While he still considers Dale his father, never learning the truth, Joseph starts to treat John Redcorn as a mentor in &quot;Vision Quest&quot;.

In the season 12 episode &quot;Untitled Blake McCormick Project&quot;, John Redcorn finds out he has a daughter named Kate by a woman named Charlene during the same period that he was having an affair with Nancy. John Redcorn had forgotten about it since, and Nancy was not happy when she learned about his double affair. Charlene then falls for Bill and moves her family in with him; likewise, Kate and Joseph fall for each other, which disturbs all the characters aware of the children&#x27;s shared parentage. At the end of the episode, Charlene and her two kids leave Bill and move in with John Redcorn, although they are never seen or mentioned for the rest of the series.

== Personality ==
John Redcorn will often use terms and mannerisms of his Native American heritage during certain situations. He is often depicted as a ladies&#x27; man as he is both handsome and kind. However, part of his behavior is a ruse as he is well known to date numerous women of nearly any age.

He is very in tune with his Native American ancestry, and he often talks about the struggles that Native Americans have gone through under the &quot;white man&quot; and is adamant that he will do what he can to get back land that he says once belonged to his tribe. Dale Gribble is one individual in particular who has helped John Redcorn research U.S. federal and tribal laws on how to get back his land. On one occasion, with Dale&#x27;s help, Redcorn succeeded in getting a land settlement offer from the U.S. government, but the settlement only allowed the return of twelve acres of land with a highway running across (he had asked for 130,000 acres back all at once). Although he at first was reasonably disheartened at the vastly meager amount of land returned to him, Redcorn accepted the acres and told Dale that he would give him the land upon his death as well as allowing Joseph to inherit his forefathers&#x27; land.

While John Redcorn shows great disdain about what white men have done to his people, he shows some hypocritical behavior as he had an affair with Nancy Gribble for nearly the entire time she was married and has at times gone against his heritage in order for things to personally benefit him.

<text>The Devon Rex is a tall-eared, short-haired breed of cat that emerged in England during the late 1950s. The breed is known for its atypical appearance, with an oddly shaped head, large eyes, and the short and wavy coat.

==History==

===Origin===
Beryl Cox came across a novel curly-coated kitten in Buckfastleigh, Devon in 1960 whom she decided to name &quot;Kirlee&quot;. Originally, Cox believed the cat&#x27;s gene to be related to the Cornish Rex which led to her breeding Kirlee with Cornish Rexes. However, when the queen gave birth the kittens all had straight coats, which led to the discovery that Kirlee had a different mutation than Cornish Rexes. Following this Cox began a breeding program to try and preserve Kirlee&#x27;s unique mutation.

==Appearance==
The Devon Rex is a very short haired breed with a medium build and a unique head type which gives the breed a &#x27;pixie-like&#x27; appearance. The head is short with a broad wedge and the brow curving to a flat skull. The eyes are large, set wide, and oval-shaped. Devon Rexes may have any eye colour. The ears are large and set wide apart with rounded tips. The coat is short dense and soft and curls inwards a little giving it a waved or rippled effect. Some areas of the body such as the neck may lack enough fur for the wave/ripple effect. The whiskers and eyebrows are crinkled and twisted. Devon Rexes may come in any colour.

==Health==
Hereditary myopathy is found in some Devon Rexes. It is caused by a genetic variant known as COLQ and it appears anytime from 3 to 23 weeks of age. Typically, there is a chance that the myopathy in the cats might stabilize, however, most of the time, the condition worsens and the Devon rex cats die from laryngospasm, after obstructing their larynx with food. 

The Devon Rex was found to be predisposed to feline atopic dermatitis in a retrospective study of cases of the disease.

The Devon Rex is predisposed to congenital hypotrichosis and Malassezia dermatitis.

<doc id="146039" wikidata="Q76870" url="?curid=146039" title="Andreas Baader">
<text>Berndt Andreas Baader (6 May 1943 – 18 October 1977), was a West German communist and leader of the left-wing militant organization Red Army Faction (RAF) also commonly known as &quot;the Baader-Meinhof Group&quot;.

== Life ==
Andreas Baader was born in Munich on 6 May 1943. He was the only child of historian and archivist Berndt Phillipp Baader and Anneliese Hermine &quot;Nina&quot; (Kröcher). Andreas was raised by his mother, aunt, and grandmother. Phillipp Baader served in the Wehrmacht, was captured on the Russian Front in 1945, and never returned. 

Baader was a high school dropout and a bohemian before his involvement in the Red Army Faction. He was one of the few members of the RAF who did not attend university.

At the age of twenty, Baader moved from Munich to West Berlin, allegedly to do an artistic education. He worked as a construction worker and unsuccessfully as a tabloid journalist.

Baader took part in the in 1962. According to his mother, he is said to have drawn the conclusion from the actions of the police that &quot;something was wrong&quot; in the state. According to journalist Butz Peters, the events of the Munich city summer during 1962 were &quot;a shocking experience for the nineteen-year-old&quot;.

== RAF involvement ==
In 1968, Baader and his girlfriend Gudrun Ensslin were convicted of the arson bombing of a department store in Frankfurt, to protest what they described as the public&#x27;s &quot;indifference to the genocide in Vietnam&quot;.

After being sentenced, Baader and Ensslin fled in November 1969. They were smuggled out of West Germany by sympathizers and made the tour of the left-wing communities of France, Switzerland, and Italy before re-entering West Germany covertly in early 1970.

Baader was later caught at a traffic stop in Berlin for speeding on 4 April 1970. He produced a fake driver&#x27;s license in the name of the author Peter Chotjewitz, but was placed under arrest when he failed to answer personal questions about the names and ages of Chotjewitz&#x27;s children.

Ensslin masterminded an escape plan. Journalist Ulrike Meinhof and Baader&#x27;s lawyers concocted a false &quot;book deal&quot; in which Meinhof would interview Baader. A few weeks later, in May 1970, he was allowed to meet her at the library of the &quot;Berlin Zentralinstitut&quot; outside the prison, without handcuffs but escorted by two armed guards. Meinhof was allowed to join him. Confederates Irene Goergens and Ingrid Schubert entered the library carrying suitcases, then opened a door to admit a masked gunman armed with a pistol and then drew pistols out of suitcases. They then fired shots that wounded a 64-year-old librarian, hitting him in his liver. Baader, the masked gunman, and the three women then fled through a window.

The group became known as the &quot;Baader-Meinhof Group&quot;. Baader and others then spent some time in a Fatah military training camp in Jordan before being expelled due to &quot;differences in attitudes&quot;. Back in West Germany, Baader robbed banks and bombed buildings from 1970 to 1972. Although he never obtained a driver&#x27;s licence, Baader was obsessed with driving. He regularly stole expensive sports cars for use by the gang and was arrested driving an Iso Rivolta IR 300.

On 1 June 1972, Baader and fellow RAF members Jan-Carl Raspe and Holger Meins were apprehended after a lengthy shootout in Frankfurt.

== Stammheim ==

From 1975 to 1977, a long and expensive trial took place in a fortified building on the grounds of Stuttgart&#x27;s Stammheim Prison. As a precaution against items being smuggled in, all prisoners were strip-searched and inspected and given new clothes before and after meeting lawyers.

During a collective hunger strike in 1974, which led to the death of Meins, philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre visited Baader in Stammheim where he was being held. He allegedly described Baader after the meeting as being a &quot;twat&quot; (&quot;Quel con!&quot;). Although he did not like Baader&#x27;s behavior, he criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment Baader endured.

Meinhof was found dead in her cell at Stuttgart-Stammheim on 9 May 1976, hanging from the grating covering her cell window. Members of the Red Army Faction and others claimed that she was killed by the German authorities. The second generation of the RAF committed several kidnappings and attacks in a campaign in support of their comrades.

The three remaining defendants were convicted in April 1977 of several murders, attempted murders, and of forming a terrorist organization, and were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Militants tried to force the release of Baader and ten other imprisoned RAF members by kidnapping businessman Hanns Martin Schleyer in Cologne on 5 September 1977, as part of the sequence of events known as the &quot;German Autumn&quot;, which began on 30 July 1977 with the murder of banker Jürgen Ponto.

On 6 September 1977, an official statement was released in which the state declared that the prisoners would not be released under any circumstances, and on the same day a &quot;Kontaktsperre&quot; (&quot;communication ban&quot;) was enacted against all RAF prisoners. This order deprived prisoners of all contact with each other as well as with the outside; all visits, including those of lawyers and family members, were forbidden. The prisoners were deprived of their access to post, newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. The official justification for this was a claim by the state that the prisoners had supervised Schleyer&#x27;s kidnapping from their cells with the assistance of their lawyers. It was claimed that a hand-drawn map had been found which had been used in the kidnapping in Newerla&#x27;s car on 5 September. On 10 September, the prisoners&#x27; lawyers lost their appeal against the &quot;Kontaktsperre&quot; order and on 2 October it became effective. On 18 October 1977, the RAF killed Schleyer in France.

On 13 October 1977 four members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181 on a flight from Palma de Mallorca to Frankfurt, their leader demanding the release of the eleven RAF prisoners detained at Stammheim. The aircraft was eventually flown to Mogadishu, Somalia, where it arrived in the early hours of 17 October. The passengers of the Boeing 737 were freed in an assault carried out by German GSG 9 special forces in the early hours of 18 October 1977 which saw the death of three of the militants.

== Death ==

According to official accounts of his death, Raspe learned about GSG 9&#x27;s success on a smuggled transistor radio and spent the next few hours talking to Baader, Ensslin, and Möller, who agreed to a suicide pact. In the morning, Baader and Raspe were found dead in their cells, having died from gunshot wounds, while Ensslin was found hanging from a noose made from the speaker wire. RAF member Irmgard Möller was found with four stab wounds to her chest, but survived.

All official inquiries on the matter concluded that Baader and his two accomplices committed collective suicide, and Baader-Meinhof biographer Stefan Aust argued in the original edition of his book, &quot;The Baader-Meinhof Group&quot; (1985), that they did kill themselves. But there was a controversy about the weapons they used to commit suicide.

Aspects of the deaths have been debated: Baader was supposed to have shot himself in the base of the neck so that the bullet exited through his forehead; repeated tests indicated that it was virtually impossible for a person to hold and fire a gun in such a way. In addition, three bullet holes were found in his cell: one lodged in the wall, one in the mattress, and the fatal bullet itself lodged in the floor, suggesting that Baader had fired twice before killing himself. Finally, Baader had powder burns on his right hand, but he was left-handed. Raspe showed no signs of powder burns.

The theory itself that guns had been smuggled into Stammheim depended on the testimony of Hans Joachim Dellwo (brother of prisoner Karl-Heinz Dellwo) and Volker Speitel (husband of Angelika Speitel). Both had been arrested on 2 October 1977, and charged with belonging to a criminal association; under pressure from the police, they subsequently became crown witnesses and admitted to acting as couriers and testified that they were aware of lawyers smuggling items to the prisoners during the trial. In consideration of this testimony, authorities reduced their sentences and provided them with new identities. In 1979, two defence attorneys were tried and convicted for smuggling weapons. However, as noted above, the lawyers had been unable to meet with their clients after 6 September 1977 due to the &quot;Kontaktsperre&quot; order.

=== Study of brain ===
Following their apparent suicides, the German government had the brains of Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin and Raspe removed for study at the Neurological Research Institute at the University of Tübingen. Meinhof&#x27;s brain contained scar tissue, the result of surgery to remove a benign tumor in 1962, that could have affected her behavior. The results of the study of the others&#x27; brains are not known.

Aside from the removal of his brain, a death mask was made of Baader. The brains of all but Meinhof have apparently been lost and cannot be accounted for by German authorities.

<text>The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), also called the Battle of the Campus Mauriacus, Battle of Châlons, Battle of Troyes or the Battle of Maurica, took place on June 20, 451 AD, between a coalition, led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I, against the Huns and their vassals, commanded by their king, Attila. It proved to be one of the last major military operations of the Western Roman Empire, although Germanic &quot;foederati&quot; composed the majority of the coalition army. The exact strategic significance is disputed. Historians generally agree that the siege of Aurelianum was the decisive moment in the campaign and stopped the Huns&#x27; attempt to advance any further into Roman territory or establish vassals in Roman Gaul. However, the Huns looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. Attila died only two years later, in 453. After the Battle of Nedao in 454, the coalition of the Huns and the incorporated Germanic vassals gradually disintegrated.

==Prelude==
By 450 AD, the Romans had restored their authority in much of the province of Gaul, although control over all of the provinces beyond Italy was continuing to diminish. Armorica was only nominally part of the empire, and Germanic tribes occupying Roman territory had been forcibly settled and bound by treaty as Foederati under their own leaders. Northern Gaul between the Rhine north of Xanten and the Lys (Germania Inferior) had unofficially been abandoned to the Salian Franks. The Visigoths on the Garonne were growing restive, but still holding to their treaty. The Burgundians in Sapaudia were more submissive, but likewise awaiting an opening for revolt. The Alans on the Loire and in Valentinois were more loyal, having served the Romans since the defeat of Jovinus in 411 and the Siege of Bazas in 414. The parts of Gaul still securely in Roman control were the Mediterranean coastline; a region including Aurelianum (present-day Orléans) along the Seine and the Loire as far north as Soissons and Arras; the middle and upper Rhine to Cologne; and downstream along the Rhône.

The historian Jordanes states that Attila was enticed by the Vandal king Genseric to wage war on the Visigoths. At the same time, Genseric would attempt to sow strife between the Visigoths and the Western Roman Empire. However, Jordanes&#x27; account of Gothic history is notoriously unreliable. Modern scholars now believe that this explanation was Jordanes projecting contemporary events and political opinions onto Attila&#x27;s time, and it was likely not original to Priscus. Christiensen points out that Amalafrida, wife of Thrasamund, was imprisoned and murdered by Hilderic after Thrasamund&#x27;s death in 523, and that the tale of the blinding of Theodoric&#x27;s daughter by Huneric was a fabrication.

Other contemporary writers offer different motivations: Justa Grata Honoria, the sister of the emperor Valentinian III, had been betrothed to the former consul Bassus Herculanus the year before. In 450, she sent the eunuch Hyacinthus to the Hunnic king asking for Attila&#x27;s help in escaping her confinement, with her ring as proof of the letter&#x27;s legitimacy. Allegedly, Attila interpreted it as offering her hand in marriage, and he had claimed half of the empire as a dowry. He demanded Honoria to be delivered along with the dowry. Valentinian rejected these demands, and Attila used it as an excuse to launch a destructive campaign through Gaul. Hughes suggests that the reality of this interpretation should be that Honoria was using Attila&#x27;s status as honorary &quot;magister militum&quot; for political leverage.

Another conflict leading into the war was that in 449, the King of the Franks (possibly Chlodio) had died and that his two sons argued over the succession: while the older son sought Attila&#x27;s help, the younger sided with Aetius, who adopted him. The identity of the younger prince, who was seen at Rome by the historian Priscus, remains unclear, though both Merowech and Childeric I have been suggested.

Attila crossed the Rhine early in 451 with his followers and a large number of allies, sacking Divodurum (now Metz) on April 7. Schultheis notes, however, that sacking of Metz on April 7 may have been a literary trope used by Hydatius and Gregory of Tours to emphasize Attila&#x27;s pagan nature to a Christian audience and may not be reliable. Other cities attacked can be determined by the hagiographies written to commemorate their bishops: Nicasius was slaughtered before the altar of his church in Reims; Servatius is alleged to have saved Tongeren with his prayers, as Genevieve is to have saved Lutetia. Lupus, bishop of Troyes, is also credited with saving his city by meeting Attila in person. Many other cities also claim to have been attacked in these accounts, although archaeological evidence shows no destruction layer dating to the timeframe of the invasion. The most likely explanation for Attila&#x27;s widespread devastation of Gaul is that Attila&#x27;s main column followed the Roman roads and crossed the Rhine at Argentoratum (Strasbourg) before marching to Borbetomagus (Worms), Mogontiacum (Mainz), Augusta Treverorum (Trier), Divodurum (Metz), Durocotorum (Reims), and finally Aurelianum (Orléans), while sending a small detachment north into Frankish territory to plunder the countryside. This explanation would support the literary evidence claiming North Gaul was attacked, and the archaeological evidence showing major population centers were not sacked.

Attila&#x27;s army had reached Aurelianum (modern Orléans, France) before June. According to Jordanes, the Alan king Sangiban, whose Foederati realm included Aurelianum, had promised to open the city gates. This siege is confirmed by the account of the &quot;Vita S. Aniani&quot; and in the later account of Gregory of Tours, although Sangiban&#x27;s name does not appear in their accounts. However, the inhabitants of Aurelianum shut their gates against the advancing invaders, and Attila began to besiege the city, while he waited for Sangiban to deliver on his promise. There are two different accounts of the Siege of Aurelianum, and Hughes suggests that combining them provides a better understanding of what actually happened. After four days of heavy rain, Attila began his final assault on June 14, which was broken off due to the approach of the Roman coalition. Modern scholars tend to agree that the Siege of Aurelianum was the high point of Attila&#x27;s attack on the West, and the staunch Alan defence of the city was the real decisive factor in the war of 451. Contrary to Jordanes, the Alans were never planning to defect as they were the loyal backbone of the Roman defence in Gaul.

==Forces==
Both armies consisted of combatants from many peoples. Besides the Roman troops, the Alans, and the Visigoths, Jordanes lists Aetius&#x27; allies as including the Francii, Sarmatae, Armoriciani, Liticiani, Burgundiones, Saxones, Riparii, and Olibrones (whom he describes as &quot;once Roman soldiers and now the flower of the allied forces&quot;), as well as &quot;other Celtic or German tribes.&quot; The Liticiani could be either Laeti or Romano-Britons, the latter of which are recorded by Gregory. Halsall argues that the Rhine limitanei and the old British field army composed the forces of the Riparii and Armoricans, and Heather suggests that the Visigoths may have been able to field about 25,000 men total. Drinkwater adds that a faction of Alemanni may have participated in the battle, possibly on both sides like the Franks and Burgundians. The Olibrones remain unknown, although it has been suggested these were Germanic limitanei garrisons. Schultheis argues that on paper, the Germanic federates could theoretically number more than 70,000, but likely numbered under 50,000.

A sense of the size of the actual Roman army may be found in the study of the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; by A.H.M. Jones. This document is a list of officials and military units that was last updated in the first decades of the fifth century. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; lists 58 regular units, and 33 &quot;limitanei&quot; serving either in the Gallic provinces or on the frontiers nearby; the total of these units, based on Jones&#x27; analysis, is 34,000 for the regular units and 11,500 for the &quot;limitanei&quot;, or just under 46,000 all told. This figure is an estimate for the years 395–425 and one that changes with new research. The loss of the Western Roman provinces in North Africa resulted in the loss of funding for 40,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry in the Roman army, in addition to previous losses, which was enough to permanently cripple Roman military capacity after 439 AD. According to Herwig Wolfram, with an annual revenue of 40,000 pounds of gold in 450 AD, the Western Empire would have had to spend almost two thirds of its income to maintain an army of 30,000 men. Hugh Elton gives the same figure in 450, but estimates the cost of maintaining an army of 300,000 at 31,625 lbs. of gold or 7.6 solidi a year per soldier. He states that there were also other unquantifiable military costs such as defensive installations, equipment, supplies, paper, animals and other costs. The size of the army in 450 AD therefore must have been significantly reduced from its status in the late 420s. Schultheis argues that the Roman field army as calculated from his own estimates of the Notitia Dignitatum, chronology of military losses, and income losses numbered approximately 20,500 &quot;comitatenses&quot; and 18,000 &quot;limitanei&quot; by the time of the battle, not including supernumerary officers.

Jordanes&#x27; list for Attila&#x27;s allies includes the Gepids under their king Ardaric, as well as an army of various Gothic groups led by the brothers Valamir, Theodemir (the father of the later Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great) and Videmir, scions of the Amali Goths. Sidonius Apollinaris offers a more extensive list of allies: Rugians, Gepids, Geloni, Burgundians, Sciri, Bellonoti, Neuri, Bastarnae, Thuringians, Bructeri, and Franks living along the River Neckar. E.A. Thompson expresses his suspicions that some of these names are drawn from literary traditions rather than from the event,

On the other hand, Thompson believes that the presence of Burgundians on the Hunnic side is credible, noting that a group is documented remaining east of the Rhine; he believes that the other peoples Sidonius mentions (the Rugians, Sciri, and Thuringians) were participants in this battle. Although there is no direct evidence that Heruli were present, as indirect evidence, centuries later Pauls Diaconus listed the subject peoples who Attila could call upon in addition to the better known Goths and Gepids: &quot;Marcomanni, Suebi, Quadi, and alongside them the Herules, Thuringi and Rugii&quot;.

Thompson remarks in a footnote, &quot;I doubt that Attila could have fed an army of even 30,000 men&quot;. Lindner argues that by crossing the Carpathians to the area of modern Hungary the Huns had forfeited their best logistic base and grazing grounds, and that the Great Hungarian Plain could only support 15,000 mounted nomads. Schultheis notes that Attila had control of other Hunnic groups east of the Carpathians, and proposes the eastern half of Attila&#x27;s empire could field an additional 7,000 to 12,000 men based on later 6th century sources. Kim notes that the Huns continued use of the Xiongnu decimal system, meaning their army was probably organized into divisions of 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000, but no real estimates of Hunnic military capacity can be determined. Their barbarian allies do receive mentions at other times in other sources: in 430 CE. The Hunnish king Octar was defeated by a force of 3,000 Neckar Burgundians who would later come under Hun subjugation, and Heather estimates that the Gepids and the Amali Goths could have each fielded a maximum of 15,000 men at the Battle of Nedao in 454. Schultheis argues that when combining primary and secondary source estimates Attila&#x27;s forces would number more than 100,000 on paper, but was likely closer to 70,000. The Chronicon Paschale, which preserves an extremely abbreviated and garbled fragment of Priscus&#x27; account of the campaign, states that Attila&#x27;s forces numbered in the tens of thousands. Assuming that the Hunnic and Germanic forces were roughly the same size as the Roman and federate army, those involved in the battle could have been well in excess of 100,000 combatants in total. This excludes the inevitable servants and camp followers who usually escape mention in the primary sources.

==Site of the Catalaunian Fields==
The actual location of the Catalaunian Fields has long been considered unclear. As a whole, the current scholarly consensus is that there is no conclusive site, merely being that it is in the vicinity of Châlons-en-Champagne (formerly called Châlons-sur-Marne) or Troyes. Historian Thomas Hodgkin located the site near Méry-sur-Seine. A more recent evaluation of the location has been performed by Phillippe Richardot, who proposed a location of La Cheppe, slightly north of the modern town of Châlons.

In 1842, at Pouan-les-Vallées, a village on the south bank of the river Aube, a labourer uncovered a burial containing a skeleton, a number of jewels and gold ornaments, and two swords. By the nature of its grave goods, it was initially thought to be the burial of Theodoric, but Hodgkin expressed skepticism, suggesting that this elite burial was that of a princely Germanic warrior who had lived in the fifth century. The Treasure of Pouan is conserved in the Musée des beaux-arts de Troyes, Troyes. It is still not known whether or not the find is related to the battle.

Simon Macdowall in his 2015 Osprey title proposed the battle took place at Montgueux just west of Troyes. Macdowall goes as far as to identify the Roman alliance&#x27;s camp site being placed at Fontvannes, a few kilometers west of the proposed battlefield, and places Attila&#x27;s camp on the Seine at Saint-Lyé. This draws on the earlier work of M. Girard, who was able to identify &quot;Maurica&quot; as the &quot;les Maures&quot; ridge of Montgueux, based on the second &quot;Additamenta Altera&quot; to Prosper&#x27;s &quot;Epitoma Chronicon&quot;, which states it took place five Roman miles from &quot;Tecis&quot; or &quot;Tricasses&quot;, the modern Troyes. The road in the region is known as the &quot;Voie des Maures&quot;, and the base of the ridge is known as &quot;l&#x27;enfer&quot; to the locals. A small stream near the battlefield that runs to Troyes is known as &quot;la Riviere de Corps&quot; to this day. According to MacDowall, modern maps continue to identify the plains in the region as the &quot;les Maurattes.&quot; Iaroslav Lebedensky argued the battle likely stretched across the plain from Montgueux south to Tourvellieres, while Schultheis argues that the battle took place wholly on the &quot;les Maures&quot; ridge itself until its final phase, when retreating and pursuing forces stretched across several kilometers. The ridge at Montgueux is currently the most thoroughly researched proposal for the battlefield location.

==Battle==

Upon learning of the invasion, the &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot; Flavius Aetius moved his army rapidly from Italy to Gaul. According to Sidonius Apollinaris, he was leading a force consisting of &quot;few and sparse auxiliaries without one regular soldier.&quot; The insignificant number of Roman troops reported is probably due to the fact the majority of Aetius&#x27; army was stationed in Gaul, combined with Sidonius&#x27; need to embellish the account in favor of Avitus. Aetius immediately attempted to persuade Theodoric I, king of the Visigoths, to join him. Allegedly, Theodoric learned how few troops Aetius had with him and decided it was wiser to wait and oppose the Huns in his own lands, so Aetius then turned to the former Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, Avitus, for help. According to tradition, Avitus was not only able to persuade Theodoric to join the Romans, but also a number of other wavering barbarian residents in Gaul. The coalition assembled at Arelate (Arles) before moving to meet the Goths at Tolosa (Toulouse), and the army was supplied by Tonantius Ferreolus, who had been preparing for a Hunnic attack for a few years. The combined army then marched to Aurelianum (present-day Orléans), reaching that city on June 14.

From Aurelianum, Aetius and his coalition pursued Attila, who was leaving Gaul with the majority of his objectives completed. According to Jordanes, the night before the main battle, some of the Franks allied with the Romans encountered a band of the Gepids loyal to Attila and engaged them in a skirmish. Jordanes&#x27; recorded number of 15,000 dead on either side for this skirmish is not verifiable. Attila had set up a tactical delay along his route of retreat in order to keep Aetius from catching him before he arrived at a suitable battlefield location. The two forces at last met somewhere on the Catalaunian Fields circa June 20, a date first proposed by J. B. Bury and since accepted by many, although some authors have proposed the first week of July or September 27. The date of the battle can be secured to June by the entries of Hydatius&#x27; chronicle, which places it in-between the appearance and disappearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet.

According to tradition, Attila had his diviners examine the entrails of a sacrifice the morning of the day of the battle. They foretold that disaster would befall the Huns, but one of the enemy leaders would be killed. Attila delayed until the ninth hour (about 2:30 pm) so the impending sunset would help his troops to flee the battlefield in case of defeat. Hughes takes his own interpretation of this, noting that the divination may be an indicator of Attila&#x27;s barbarity and therefore possibly a fabrication. He states that the choice to begin the battle at the ninth hour was due to the fact that both sides spent the entire day carefully deploying their coalition armies.

According to Jordanes, the Catalaunian plain rose on one side by a sharp slope to a ridge; this geographical feature dominated the battlefield and became the center of the battle. The Huns first seized the right side of the ridge, while the Romans seized the left, with the crest unoccupied between them. Jordanes explains that the Visigoths held the right side, the Romans the left, with Sangiban of uncertain loyalty and his Alans surrounded in the middle. The Hunnic forces attempted to take the ridge, but were outstripped by the Romans under Aetius and the Goths under Thorismund.

Jordanes goes on to state that Theodoric, whilst leading his own men against the enemy Amali Goths, was killed in the assault without his men noticing. He then states that Theodoric was either thrown from his horse and trampled to death by his advancing men, or slain by the spear of the Amali Andag. Since Jordanes served as the notary of Andag&#x27;s son Gunthigis, even if this latter story is not true, this version was certainly a proud family tradition.

Then Jordanes claims the Visigoths outstripped the speed of the Alans beside them and fell upon Attila&#x27;s own Hunnic household unit. Attila was forced to seek refuge in his own camp, which he had fortified with wagons. The Romano-Gothic charge apparently swept past the Hunnic camp in pursuit; when night fell, Thorismund, son of king Theodoric, returning to friendly lines, mistakenly entered Attila&#x27;s encampment. There he was wounded in the ensuing melee before his followers could rescue him. Darkness also separated Aetius from his own men. As he feared that disaster had befallen them, he spent the rest of the night with his Gothic allies.

On the following day, finding the battlefield was &quot;piled high with bodies and the Huns did not venture forth&quot;, the Goths and Romans met to decide their next move. Knowing that Attila was low on provisions and &quot;was hindered from approaching by a shower of arrows placed within the confines of the Roman camp&quot;, they started to besiege his camp. In this desperate situation, Attila remained unbowed and &quot;heaped up a funeral pyre of horse saddles, so that if the enemy should attack him, he was determined to cast himself into the flames, that none might have the joy of wounding him and that the lord of so many races might not fall into the hands of his foes&quot;.

While Attila was besieged in his camp, the Visigoths searched for their missing king and his son Thorismund. After a long search, they found Theodoric&#x27;s corpse &quot;where the dead lay thickest&quot; and bore him away with heroic songs in sight of the enemy. Upon learning of his father&#x27;s death, Thorismund wanted to assault Attila&#x27;s camp, but Aetius dissuaded him. According to Jordanes, Aetius feared that if the Huns were completely destroyed, the Visigoths would break off their allegiance to the Roman Empire and become an even graver threat. So Aetius persuaded Thorismund to return home quickly and secure the throne for himself, before his brothers could. Otherwise, civil war would ensue among the Visigoths. Thorismund quickly returned to Tolosa (present-day Toulouse) and became king without any resistance. Gregory of Tours claims Aetius used the same reasoning to dismiss his Frankish allies, and collected the booty of the battlefield for himself.

==Outcome==
The primary sources give little information as to the outcome of the battle, barring Jordanes. All emphasize the casualty count of the battle, and the battle became increasingly seen as a Gothic victory, beginning with Cassiodorus in the early sixth century.

Hydatius states:The Huns broke the peace and plundered the Gallic provinces. A great many cities were taken. On the Catalaunian Plains, not far from the city of Metz, which they had taken, the Huns were cut down in battle with the aid of God and defeated by general Aetius and King Theoderic, who had made a peace treaty with each other. The darkness of night interrupted the fighting. King Theoderic was laid low there and died. Almost 300,000 men are said to have fallen in that battle. — Hydatius, &quot;Chronicon&quot;, 150.Prosper, contemporary to the battle, states:
After killing his brother, Attila was strengthened by the resources of the deceased and forced many thousands of neighboring peoples into a war. This war, he announced as a guardian of Roman friendship, he would wage only against the Goths. But when he had crossed the Rhine and many Gallic cities had experienced his savage attacks, both our people and the Goths soon agreed to oppose with allied forces the fury of their proud enemies. And Aetius had such great foresight that, when fighting men were hurriedly collected from everywhere, a not unequal force met the opposing multitude. Although the slaughter of all those who died there was incalculable – for neither side gave way – it appears that the Huns were defeated in this battle because those among them that survived lost their taste for fighting and turned back home. —Prosper, &quot;Epitoma Chronicon&quot;, s.a. 451.

The battle raged five miles down from Troyes on the field called Maurica in Campania. —&quot;Additamenta ad Chronicon Prosperi Hauniensis&quot;, s.a. 451.

At this time Attila, king of the Huns, invaded the Gauls. Here trusting in lord Peter the apostle himself patrician Aetius proceeded against him, he would fight with the help of God. —&quot;Continuatio Codex Ovetensis&quot;.

Battle was made in the Gauls between Aetius and Attila king of the Huns with both peoples and massacre. Attila fled into the greater Gauls. —&quot;Continuatio Codex Reichenaviensis&quot;.The Gallic Chronicles of 452 and 511 state:Attila entered Gaul as if he had the right to ask for a wife that was owed to him. There, he inflicted and suffered defeat and then withdrew to his homeland. —&quot;Chronica Gallica Anno&quot; 452, s.a. 451.

Patrician Aetius with King Theodoric of the Goths fight against Attila king of the Huns at Tricasses on the Mauriac plain, where Theodoric was slain, by whom it is uncertain, and Laudaricus the relative of Attila: and the bodies were countless. —&quot;Chronica Gallica Anno&quot; 511, s.a. 451.The &quot;Paschale Chronicle&quot;, preserving a garbled and abbreviated passage of Priscus, states:While Theodosius and Valentinian, the Augusti, were emperors, Attila, from the race of the Gepid Huns, marched against Rome and Constantinople with a multitude of many tens of thousands. He notified Valentinian, the emperor of Rome, through a Gothic ambassador, &quot;Attila, my master and yours, orders you through me to make ready the palace for him.&quot; He gave the same notice to Theodosius, the emperor in Constantinople, through a Gothic ambassador. Aetius, the first man of senatorial rank in Rome, heard the excessive daring of Attila&#x27;s desperate response and went off to Alaric in Gaul, who was an enemy of Rome because of Honorius. He urged him to join him in standing against Attila, since he had destroyed many Roman cities. They unexpectedly launched himself against him as he was bivouacked near the Danubios river, and cut down his many thousands. Alaric, wounded by a &quot;saggita&quot; in the engagement, died.

Attila died similarly, carried off by a nasal hemorrhage while he slept at night with his Hunnic concubine. It was suspected that this girl killed him. The very wise Priscus the Thracian wrote about this war. —&quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, p. 587.Jordanes reports the number of dead from this battle as 165,000, excluding the casualties of the Franco-Gepid skirmish previous to the main battle. Hydatius, a historian who lived at the time of Attila&#x27;s invasion, reports the number of 300,000 dead. The garbled Chronicle of Fredegar states that in a prior battle on the Loire, 200,000 Goths and 150,000 Huns were slain. The figures offered are implausibly high, but the battle was noted as being exceptionally bloody by all of the primary sources. It is ultimately Jordanes&#x27; writing that leads to the difference in opinions in modern interpretations of the battle&#x27;s outcome.

===As a Roman victory===
In the traditional account, modern scholars take a very direct interpretation of Jordanes, although usually with various points of contention. Modern scholars tend to agree that the battle took place on a long ridge, not a plain with a hill to one side. Hughes argues that the Huns deployed in the center, with their vassals on the wings, because they were expecting a Roman infantry center, with cavalry wings. This way Attila could pin down the center with the disorganized Hunnic style of warfare, while the majority of his troops focused on breaking one or both of the enemy flanks. However, Hughes argues that the Romans were expecting this, which is why he placed the Alans in the center of the formation, who were skilled cavalrymen and had advanced knowledge of how to fight alongside the Roman style of warfare. Bachrach also notes that Jordanes&#x27; point of placing the Alans in the center due to disloyalty is biased on Jordanes&#x27; part.

Jordanes&#x27; description of the battle, according to Hughes, takes place from the Roman perspective. Attila&#x27;s forces arrived on the ridge first, on the far right side, before the Visigoths could take that position. Then Aetius&#x27; Romans arrived on the left side of the ridge, and repulsed the Gepids as they came up. Finally the Alans and the Visigoths under Thorismund fought their way up and secured the center of the ridge, holding it against Attila. However, Hughes differs from mainstream explanations in that he places Thorismund between the Alans and Visigothic main body, rather than on the Visigothic flank. MacDowall, for example, places Thorismund on the far right of the battlefield. The final phase of the battle is characterized by the Gothic attempt to take the right side of the ridge, in which Theodoric is slain, with the rest of his army unaware of his death. It is at this point that Thorismund located Attila&#x27;s position in the Hunnic battle line, and attacked the Hunnic center, nearly slaying Attila himself and forcing the Hunnic center to retreat. Both armies fell into confusion as darkness descended, and neither side knew the outcome of the battle until the following morning.

After the battle, the allies decided what to do next, and resolved to place Attila under siege for a few days while they discussed the matter. Aetius allegedly persuaded both Thorismund and the Goths, and the Franks as well, to leave the battle and return home. Hughes argues that since the Franks were fighting a civil war in the battle, and Thorismund had five brothers who could usurp his new-found position as king, that it is likely Aetius did advise them to do so. O&#x27;Flynn argues that Aetius persuaded the Visigoths to return home in order to eliminate a group of volatile allies, and argues that he let Attila escape because he would have been just as happy to make an alliance with the Huns as with the Visigoths. The majority of historians also share the view that at this point Attila&#x27;s &quot;aura of invincibility&quot; was broken, and that Aetius allowed the Huns to retreat in the hopes he could return to a status of partnership with them and draw on the Huns for future military support.

===As a Roman defeat or indecisive===
It has been suggested by Hyun Jin Kim that the entire battle is a play on the Battle of Marathon, with the Romans being the Plateans on the left, the Alans the weak Athenian center, and the Goths the Athenian regulars on the right, with Theodoric as Miltiades and Thorismund as Callimachus. He sees the return home by the Goths to secure Thorismund&#x27;s throne as the same as the return to Athens to protect it from sedition and the Persian Navy. Kim&#x27;s suggestion of Jordanes borrowing Herodotus has been noted by prior scholarship: Franz Altheim drew a parallel between the Catalaunian Fields and Salamis, and thought that the battle narrative was completely fabricated. John Wallace-Hadrill drew a parallel between Aetius and Themistocles regarding the alleged subterfuge after the battle in some primary source accounts. Other historians have noted its possible political statements on Jordanes&#x27; contemporary time, particularly regarding the Battle of Vouille and the Gothic Wars towards the end of Justinian&#x27;s reign. Ultimately this has led mainstream scholarship to agree that Jordanes&#x27; description of the Battle of the Catalaunian fields is distorted, even if they do not agree with a pro-Hunnish interpretation of the outcome. However, Kim&#x27;s views have received a mixed reception among scholars of the period, with one reviewer noting that much of the text amounts to &quot;a confused and confusing story, involving the rewriting of histories, genealogies and chronologies... exacerbated by strange and clumsy conflations.&quot; His view that Attila won the battle therefore should be taken with skepticism.

Other authors have previously considered the battle to have been indecisive. This latter view is rather widely accepted, although the outcome remains in disagreement as a whole. The most recent and comprehensive argument for an indecisive outcome belongs to that of Schultheis, who argues that Jordanes&#x27; work is more complicated than assumed due to the rearranging of a narrative first penned by a Goth named Ablabius in 471 and expanded by Cassiodorus, which he then himself abridged again and which in turn was used by Jordanes. Schultheis argues that provided that the entire conflict was not a literary &quot;topos&quot; based on the Battle of Marathon, the Alans were placed in the center of the battle line due to their effectiveness against the Huns as prescribed by the Strategikon of Pseudo-Maurice, and that Jordanes&#x27; text indicates the Hunnic center retreated before Thorismund charged. The Romans and Alans attacked down the ridge and across the plain to Attila&#x27;s camp, while the Amali and other Gothic groups chased the collapsing Gothic right back to their camp, resulting in the mass confusion that followed. He concludes that losses during the retreats were heavy and led to an indecisive outcome, which an analysis of the chronology of primary source accounts shows over time was embellished into a Gothic victory.

==Aftermath and reputation of the battle==
The immediate and long-term effects of the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields are somewhat disputed. Attila returned to invade the Western Roman Empire in 452, which was more successful than his invasion of Gaul. After a 3-month siege of Aquileia, arranged by Aetius in the hopes it would use up his whole campaigning season, Attila razed the city and ravaged the Po Valley. Aetius, without aid from the federates in Gaul and without the military capacity to stop Attila on his own, sent an embassy consisting of Pope Leo I, Trygetius, and Gennadius Avienus to broker a treaty with Attila. Attila ultimately retreated from Italy, most likely due to a local famine and disease within his army. Some authors have argued that this sequence of military fiascos for Aetius ultimately led to his downfall. Merrils and Miles also argue it led to the downfall of Valentinian III as a result of Aetius&#x27; assassination. This has been disputed recently by Meghan McEvoy, who argues that Valentinian III wanted to be an active emperor and simply needed to remove his manager, and that there was no real direct cause for Aetius&#x27; murder.

In Gaul, the effects were somewhat more significant. Hughes argues that their assistance at the Catalaunian Plains led the Goths to destroy the Alans and besiege Orléans, believing that they had not been adequately rewarded for their service. In turn, this led to further concessions to the Goths from Aetius after Thorismund&#x27;s assassination by his brother, who was amicable to the Romans. He thinks this may have been the point at which the Goths gained the same status of an independent kingdom that Gaiseric had. On the other hand, Kim argues that the battle led to the decline of Roman influence in northern Gaul, and strengthened the position of the Salian Franks and the Burgundians. He argues that it ultimately led to the victory of Childeric and the Franks over the Goths, the Roman comes Paul who had replaced Aegidius, and Odoacer, who returned to the Danube. This set the Franks up for dominance in Gaul and put Odoacer back in power as king of the Sciri. This would ultimately lead to his service during the final years of the Western Roman Empire and his establishment of a Kingdom of Italy.

Tackholm makes a distinct note of the increasing prominence of the battle in Gothic history. He shows that contemporary sources state the battle was inconclusive and give credit to Aetius, while later sources cast the battle as a Gothic victory and a major point of Gothic pride. This is also noted by Barnish, who claims that Cassiodorus and Jordanes works intended to portray Clovis, who had been at war with the Ostrogoths, as a new Attila and Theodoric the Great as a new Aetius. However, in the Roman sources, like those of Procopius and Victor Tunnensis, Aetius remains the central figure of pride and importance.

The most important effect of the battle is usually considered to be its impact on long-term Hunnic hegemony in Europe, of which there are differing opinions.

==Historical importance==

===Traditional view: battle was of macro-historical importance===
The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains is given its first modern historical perspective by Edward Gibbon, who called it the last victory achieved in the name of the Western Roman Empire. The first individual historical survey of the battle was given by Edward Shepherd Creasy, who heralded it as a triumph of Christian Europe over the pagan savages of Asia, saving classical heritage and European culture.

John Julius Norwich, a historian known for his works on Venice and on Byzantium, somewhat reiterates Creasy, saying of the battle of Châlons:

Modern authors have mostly moved away from this viewpoint though, some categorizing it as a battle that broke the myth of Hunnish invincibility. Parker called it a triumph of Roman defensive strategy. Arther Ferrill notes that, aside from the Battle of Qarqar (Karkar), this was the first significant conflict that involved large alliances on both sides. No single nation dominated either side; rather, two alliances met and fought in surprising coordination for the time. Meghan McEvoy, also, indicates that Aetius&#x27; successful construction and utilization of the federates in Gaul was a testament to his diplomatic and administrative skills, as well as to the influence of his military success. Ferrill writes:

Hyun Jin Kim thinks that the battle had a major impact on the future of Roman Gaul. He doesn&#x27;t believe that it was a religious and cultural victory over the Huns of Central Asia. Kim argues that the battle significantly weakened the military capacity of the Alans, Visigoths, and the Romans, which allowed for Frankish and Burgundian hegemony in North Gaul. He also believes that it set up the career of Odoacer, who was later to found his own Kingdom in Italy after deposing the last Western Roman Emperor and submitting to Constantinople.

===Opposing view: battle was not of macro-historical importance===
However, J.B. Bury expresses a quite different judgement:
This assessment is also corroborated by Hughes, Bachrach, and Kim, all of whom argue that the real turning point of the invasion of Gaul was the successful defense of Orléans. They consider that the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains occurred as Attila was already retreating from Gaul. Bury also considers that as a whole, the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains would not have seriously altered history had it been a Hunnish victory:

Despite his views on the battle, it is noteworthy that Bury, who does not believe the Battle of Chalôns to be of macrohistorical importance, characterizes Aetius&#x27; rule thus: &quot;From the end of the regency to his own death, Aetius was master of the Empire in the west, and it must be imputed to his policy and arms that Imperial rule did not break down in all the provinces by the middle of the fifth century.&quot; Bury thinks it clear that there was no one capable of taking Aetius&#x27; place. But he also considers that the Battle of Nedao was far more consequential to European history than the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, a view also shared by many modern authors. Kim argues that the Huns were instrumental in triggering the evolution of medieval Europe during the early migration era by the introduction of East Asian, Central Asian, and Iranian cultural and societal practices, which agrees with Bury that the outcome of the battle would not have turned Europe into a cultural desert.

<text>MC5 was an American rock band formed in Lincoln Park, Michigan, in 1963. The classic lineup consisted of vocalist Rob Tyner, guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, bassist Michael Davis, and drummer Dennis Thompson. MC5 were listed by &quot;Parade&quot; as one of the best rock bands of all time and by VH1 as one of the greatest hard rock artists of all time.
The band&#x27;s first three albums are regarded by many as staples of rock music, and their 1969 song &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; is widely covered.

&quot;Crystallizing the counterculture movement at its most volatile and threatening&quot;, according to AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, MC5&#x27;s leftist political ties and anti-establishment lyrics and music positioned them as emerging pioneers of the punk movement in the United States. Their loud, energetic style of back-to-basics rock and roll included elements of garage rock, hard rock, blues rock, and psychedelic rock. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello described MC5 as having &quot;basically invented punk rock.&quot; 

MC5 had a promising beginning that earned them a January 1969 cover appearance on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and a story written by Eric Ehrmann before their debut live album was released. They developed a reputation for energetic and polemical live performances, one of which was recorded as their 1969 debut album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;. The band released the albums &quot;Back in the USA&quot; and &quot;High Time&quot; before disbanding in 1972.

Vocalist Tyner died of a heart attack in late 1991 at the age of 46 and was followed by Fred Smith, who also died of a heart attack, in 1994 at the age of 46. The remaining three members of the band reformed in 2003 with the Dictators&#x27; singer Handsome Dick Manitoba as its new vocalist, and this reformed lineup occasionally performed live over the next nine years until Davis died of liver failure in 2012 at the age of 68.

In 2022, Kramer announced that a tour under the banner of &quot;We Are All MC5&quot; would take place that spring, and that a new MC5 studio album with producer Bob Ezrin would also be released later that year with original MC5 drummer Dennis Thompson playing on two tracks. In 2023, Kramer announced that the album would be released in the spring of 2024. Kramer died February 2, 2024, leaving Thompson as the only surviving original member of the band. In 2024, the MC5 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical excellence category. On May 8, 2024, Thompson died at the age of 75. &quot;Heavy Lifting&quot;, their final album, was released on October 18, 2024.

==History==

===1963–1967: Formation and early years===
The origins of MC5 can be traced to the friendship between guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred Smith. Friends since their teen years, they were both fans of R&amp;B music, blues, Chuck Berry, Dick Dale, The Ventures, and what was later called garage rock: they adored any music with speed, energy and a rebellious attitude. Each guitarist/singer formed and led a rock group (Smith&#x27;s Vibratones and Kramer&#x27;s Bounty Hunters). As members of both groups left for college or straight jobs, the most committed members eventually united (under Kramer&#x27;s leadership and the &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot; name) with Billy Vargo on guitar and Leo LeDuc on drums (at this point Smith played bass). They were popular and successful enough in and around Detroit that the musicians were able to quit their day jobs and make a living from the group.

Kramer felt that they needed a manager, which led him to Rob Derminer, a few years older than the others, and deeply involved in Detroit&#x27;s hipster and left-wing political scenes. Derminer originally auditioned as a bass guitarist (a role which he held briefly in 1964, with Smith switching to guitar to replace Vargo and with Bob Gaspar replacing LeDuc). They quickly realized that Derminer&#x27;s talents could be better used as a lead singer: Though not conventionally attractive and rather paunchy by traditional frontman standards, he nonetheless had a commanding stage presence, and a booming baritone voice that evidenced his abiding love of American soul and gospel music. Derminer renamed himself Rob Tyner (after John Coltrane&#x27;s pianist McCoy Tyner). Instead of Derminer, their manager ended up being Ann Marston, a former national archery champion and beauty pageant winner.

Tyner also conceived their new name, MC5, short for &quot;Motor City Five&quot; based on their Detroit roots. In some ways the group was similar to other garage bands of the period, composing soon-to-be historic workouts such as &quot;Black to Comm&quot; during their mid-teens in the basement of the home of Kramer&#x27;s mother. Upon Tyner&#x27;s switch from bassist to vocalist, he was initially replaced by Patrick Burrows before the lineup stabilized in 1965 with the arrival of Michael Davis and Dennis Thompson to replace Burrows and Gaspar, respectively.

The music also reflected Smith and Kramer&#x27;s increasing interest in free jazz—the guitarists were inspired by the likes of Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Sun Ra and late period John Coltrane, and tried to imitate the ecstatic sounds of the squealing, high-pitched saxophonists they adored. MC5 even later opened a few U.S. midwest shows for Sun Ra, whose influence is obvious in &quot;Starship&quot;. Kramer and Smith were also deeply inspired by Sonny Sharrock, one of the few electric guitarists working in free jazz, and they eventually developed a unique interlocking style that was like little heard before: Kramer&#x27;s solos often used a heavy, irregular vibrato, while Smith&#x27;s rhythms contained an uncommon explosive energy, including patterns that conveyed great excitement, as evidenced in &quot;Black to Comm&quot; and many other songs.

Playing almost nightly any place they could in and around Detroit, MC5 quickly earned a reputation for high-energy live performances and won a sizeable local following, regularly drawing sellout audiences of 1000 or more. Contemporary rock writer Robert Bixby stated that their sound was like &quot;a catastrophic force of nature the band was barely able to control&quot;. Don McLeese noted that fans compared the aftermath of an MC5 performance to the delirious exhaustion after &quot;a street rumble or an orgy&quot;.

&quot;When I first saw them, it was before they wrote songs, or it was before they met John Sinclair,&quot; recalled Iggy Pop. &quot;They were just a really fuckin&#x27; good big city cover band, and they covered basically The Stones, Hendrix, The Who, all that shit, real well. And then they knew a little Ray Charles and shit. As they developed, I thought there was an overlay of jazz, but a lot of the music values were very hard rock. Not too bluesy.&quot;

MC5 released a cover of Them&#x27;s &quot;I Can Only Give You Everything&quot;, backed with their own &quot;One of the Guys&quot;, on the tiny AMG label in 1967.

===1968–1969: &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;===
In early 1968, the band&#x27;s second single was released by Trans-Love Energies on A-Square records (though without the knowledge of that label&#x27;s owner Jeep Holland). Housed in a striking picture sleeve, it comprised two original songs: &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Looking at You&quot;. The first pressing sold out in a few weeks, and by year&#x27;s end it had gone through more pressings totaling several thousand copies. A third single that coupled &quot;I Can Only Give You Everything&quot; with the original &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know&quot; appeared at about the same time on the AMG label, as well.

That summer MC5 toured the U.S. East Coast, which generated an enormous response, with the group often overshadowing the more famous acts they opened up for: McLeese writes that when opening for Big Brother and the Holding Company, audiences regularly demanded multiple encores of MC5, and at a memorable series of concerts, Cream—one of the leading hard rock groups of the era—&quot;left the stage vanquished&quot;. This same east coast tour led to the rapturous aforementioned &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story that praised MC5 with nearly evangelistic zeal, and also to an association with the radical group Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers.

MC5 became the leading band in a burgeoning hard rock scene, serving as mentors to fellow South-Eastern Michigan bands The Stooges and The Up, and major record labels expressed an interest in the group. As related in the notes for reissued editions of the Stooges&#x27; debut album, Danny Fields of Elektra Records came to Detroit to see MC5. At Kramer&#x27;s recommendation, he went to see The Stooges. Fields was so impressed that he ended up offering contracts to both bands in September 1968. They were the first hard rock groups signed to Elektra Records.

According to Kramer, MC5 of this period was politically influenced by the Marxism of the Black Panther Party and Fred Hampton, and poets of the Beat Generation such as Allen Ginsberg and Ed Sanders, or Modernist poets like Charles Olson. Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton prompted John Sinclair to found the White Panthers, a militant leftist organization of white people working to assist the Black Panthers. Shortly after, Sinclair was arrested for possession of marijuana.

Under the &quot;guidance&quot; of John Sinclair (who dubbed his enterprise &quot;Trans-Love Energies&quot; and refused to be categorized as a traditional manager), MC5 were soon involved in left-wing politics: Sinclair was active with the White Panther Party and &quot;Fifth Estate&quot;. In their early career, MC5 had a politically provocative stage show: They appeared onstage toting unloaded rifles, and at the climax of a performance, an unseen &quot;sniper&quot; would shoot Tyner. The band members were also all using the drugs LSD and marijuana.

The band performed as part of the protests against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago that were broken up by a police riot. The group&#x27;s appearance at the convention is also notable for their lengthy performance. What was also notable was the fact that they were also the only musical band to perform during the 1968 DNC protests. In an interview featured in the documentary &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot;, Kramer reported that while many musicians were scheduled to perform at a day-long concert, only the MC5 initially appeared. The MC5 played for over eight hours straight. Of the other scheduled performers, Kramer stated in &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; that only Neil Young actually arrived, though due to the chaos at the convention, Young didn&#x27;t perform. Dennis Thompson alleged years later that Country Joe McDonald (of Country Joe and the Fish) was also present at the scene. However, aside from members of MC5, the only other singer who was acknowledged to have performed at the convention protests was protest folk singer Phil Ochs. According to the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, Bruce Barthol was the only member of Country Joe and the Fish who was willing to perform, with other members of the band fearing a potential riot.

MC5 had a promising beginning that earned them a January 1969 cover appearance on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and a story written by Eric Ehrmann before their debut live album was released. The band earned national attention with their first album, &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, recorded live on October 30 and 31, 1968, at Detroit&#x27;s Grande Ballroom. Elektra executive Jac Holzman and producer Bruce Botnick recognized that MC5 were at their best when playing for a receptive audience. Containing such songs as the proto-punk classics &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; and &quot;Rocket Reducer No. 62 (Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa)&quot;, the spaced-out &quot;Starship&quot; (co-credited to Sun Ra because the lyrics were partly cribbed from one of Ra&#x27;s poems), and an extended cover of John Lee Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Motor City Is Burning&quot; wherein Tyner praises the role of the Black Panthers during the Detroit riots of 1967. Critic Mark Deming writes that &quot;Kick out the Jams&quot; &quot;is one of the most powerfully energetic live albums ever made ... this is an album that refuses to be played quietly.&quot;

The album caused some controversy due to Sinclair&#x27;s inflammatory liner notes and the title track&#x27;s rallying cry of &quot;Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!&quot; According to Kramer, the band recorded this as &quot;Kick out the jams, brothers and sisters!&quot; for the single released for radio play; Tyner claimed this was done without group consensus. The edited version also appeared in some LP copies, which also withdrew Sinclair&#x27;s excitable comments. The album was released in January 1969; reviews were mixed, but the album was relatively successful, quickly selling over 100,000 copies and peaking at #30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in May 1969 during a 23-week stay.

When Hudson&#x27;s, a Detroit-based department store chain, refused to stock &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; due to the obscenity, MC5 responded with a full page advertisement in the local underground magazine &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; saying &quot;Stick Alive with the MC5, and Fuck Hudson&#x27;s!&quot;, prominently including the logo of MC5&#x27;s label, Elektra Records, in the ad. Hudson&#x27;s pulled all Elektra records from their stores, and in the ensuing controversy, Jac Holzman, the head of Elektra, dropped the band from their contract. MC5 then signed with Atlantic Records.

===1970–1971: &quot;Back in the USA&quot; and &quot;High Time&quot;===
Their second album, &quot;Back in the USA&quot;, produced by future Bruce Springsteen mentor Jon Landau, virtually provided a prototype for punk rock with its short, fast, hard-edged angry guitar rock. Released on Atlantic with a vastly different production and marketing effort, the band&#x27;s sound radically differed from &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, to such an extent that, except for Tyner&#x27;s vocals, they were &quot;barely recognizable as the same band.&quot; The second album&#x27;s production also sounded compressed and somewhat limited in the band&#x27;s sonic palette compared to their earlier — band members later said that Landau was overbearing and heavy-handed in production, trying to shape the group to his own liking.
Reviews were again mixed, resulting in mediocre sales (it only peaked at #137 in the American charts in March 1970 during a seven-week stay), while the band&#x27;s tours were not as well-received as before. Exhaustion was partly to blame, from the band&#x27;s heavy touring schedule and increasingly heavy drug use.
They had fallen out with Sinclair as well, and were conspicuously not allowed to play at the December 1971 John Sinclair Freedom Rally, organized to protest his incarceration on marijuana possession, even though they were at the gig.
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;High Time&quot;, produced by Geoffrey Haslam and recorded by Artie Fields, proved influential on 1970s hard rock bands. The album was poorly promoted, and sales were worse than ever, but &quot;High Time&quot; was the best-reviewed of the band&#x27;s original records upon its initial release. The group had much more creative control, and were very satisfied with the results. This release saw the band stretch out with longer, more experimental pieces like &quot;Future/Now&quot; and the Sun Ra-influenced &quot;Skunk (Sonicly Speaking)&quot; [sic].

===1972–1991: Disbandment and post-break up===
Both &quot;Back in the USA&quot; and &quot;High Time&quot; lost money for Atlantic Records, which dropped the band. Early in 1972, the band toured Europe, playing dates in England including Cambridge with Syd Barrett&#x27;s band Stars and Canterbury with former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took, as well as a TV session in Bremen, Germany for &quot;Beat Club&quot;.

On February 13, 1972, Michael Davis left the band (he was using heroin and was all but forced out by the others), and was replaced by a series of bassists (Steve Moorhouse, Derek Hughes, and Ray Craig). The remaining members recorded three new songs—&quot;Gold&quot; (also known as &quot;Gold Rush&quot;), &quot;Train Music&quot; and &quot;Inside Out&quot;—in London shortly afterwards for the soundtrack of a film called &quot;Gold.&quot; This was the band&#x27;s final recording session.

The group continued on a little while longer, eventually reduced to Kramer, Smith, and Tyner touring and playing with Ritchie Dharma on drums and Derek Hughes on bass, playing R&amp;B covers as much as their original material.

MC5 reunited for a farewell show on December 31, 1972 at the Grande Ballroom. The venue that had only a few years before hosted over a thousand eager fans now had a few dozen people. Distraught and also in the throes of drug addiction, Kramer left the stage after only a few songs. The group disbanded not long after the event.

In 1973 Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith formed a new group called Ascension, consisting of Smith on guitar, Thompson on drums, Davis on piano, and to replace Davis on bass a local working bass player, John Hefty, was brought in. They assembled a set of mostly original music and a few R&amp;B and rock covers. Smith said the name Ascension symbolized the music and the band ascending to new heights and in new directions. They brought in a new manager, Chato Hill. They played only a few live performances and disbanded after less than a year. One live recording was made but never edited or released.

After this, Smith formed a new group called Sonic&#x27;s Rendezvous Band, married singer Patti Smith, retired from music to raise a family, and died in 1994. Sonic&#x27;s Rendezvous Band released only the &quot;City Slang&quot; single during their initial time as a group, though later recordings were released posthumously, and a reconstituted Rendezvous Band (including original member Scott Morgan, of The Rationals and a newly added Deniz Tek of Radio Birdman) reunited in tribute, years afterward. Smith also co-produced his wife&#x27;s 1988 album Dream of Life and co-wrote all the songs with her, including the single &quot;People Have the Power.&quot;

Wayne Kramer recruited Mark Manko on rhythm guitar, Tim Schafe on bass, Bob Schultz on organ, and Frank Lowenberg on drums for a new lineup of the MC5 in 1974, with Kramer singing most of the vocals. He also made scattered appearances on other people&#x27;s records before being incarcerated from 1975 through 1978 for drug offenses. While in federal prison in Kentucky, he was unexpectedly reunited with MC5 bassist Michael Davis, also behind bars on a drug charge. After he was released in 1979, Kramer went on to play with the bands Was (Not Was) with Don Was and Gang War with Johnny Thunders. Kramer worked straight jobs for several years and focused on kicking drugs. By the early 1990s, he returned to the music industry and subsequently released several well-received albums.

Rob Tyner performed under his own name for many years but also performed under &quot;The New MC5&quot; for some live gigs for a brief period. He also collaborated with Eddie and the Hot Rods, releasing a 7&quot; with them in 1979. During the mid-1980s, Tyner produced a single for Detroit band Vertical Pillows, and occasionally made brief guest appearances during some of their live shows, singing MC5 covers. Tyner became a successful producer, manager and promoter in Detroit, and released the warmly-reviewed &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; album in 1990, a year before his death in September 1991.

Michael Davis joined Detroit band Destroy All Monsters for several years in the late 70s /early 80s; the band broke up in 1983. Dennis Thompson played with various bands, including The New Order, New Race, The Motor City Bad Boys, and The Secrets.

===1992–2024: Reunions, final years, and &quot;Heavy Lifting&quot;===
The first public reunion of the band after their recording years as a group was as a four-piece, at a performance celebrating the life of the late Rob Tyner, a concert event at the State Theatre in Detroit on February 22, 1992. The event was heavily attended, and included The Rationals, Scott Richardson of SRC, The Romantics, Dee Dee Ramone, The Cult, and other musicians. The band on this evening was unbilled, but their appearance had been rumored—Wayne Kramer was the only group member advertised—and the set lasted about thirty minutes. The recording of this show remains unreleased.

In 2002, the well-received documentary &quot;MC5: A True Testimonial&quot; made its film festival premiere. 2003 saw the three surviving members of MC5—Kramer, bassist Michael Davis, and drummer Dennis Thompson (Smith had died in 1994)—performing as the MC5 at the 100 Club in London with Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith&#x27;s place temporarily being taken by Nicke Andersson of The Hellacopters, vocals at that time being taken variously by David Vanian of The Damned, Lemmy of Motörhead, Ian Astbury of The Cult, and singer Kate O&#x27;Brien, as well as seeing Charles Moore and Buzzy Jones reprise their roles in the brass section from the &quot;High Time&quot; album.

In 2004, the band set out on an extensive world tour using the name DKT/MC5 (DKT being an acronym for Davis, Kramer, and Thompson). As with the 100 Club concert, a host of special guests joined them on tour such as Mark Arm of Mudhoney, Nicke Royale of The Hellacopters, Evan Dando of The Lemonheads, Marshall Crenshaw, Deniz Tek of Radio Birdman, Lisa Kekaula of the Bellrays, and others.

In 2005, MC5 stabilized into a new lineup, consisting of Kramer, Thompson, and Davis, with Handsome Dick Manitoba, vocalist of the 1970s New York punk band The Dictators, singing lead, along with Gilby Clarke, formerly of Guns and Roses, playing rhythm guitar. This lineup continued to exist until Michael Davis&#x27; death in February 2012, upon which the group disbanded.

In May 2006, Davis injured his back in a motorcycle accident. In August 2007, Davis joined the Lords of Altamont on bass. He also founded and led the Michael H. Davis Music Is Revolution Foundation, dedicated to supporting music education programs in public schools. In 2009, Kramer founded the independent initiative Jail Guitar Doors, USA with Billy Bragg and Margaret Saadi Kramer. In 2011, MC5 was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. In February 2012, Davis died of liver failure at the age of 68.

In May 2018, Kramer announced the MC50 tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, with a lineup including himself, plus rock stalwarts Kim Thayil and Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, Brendan Canty of Fugazi, and Doug Pinnick of King&#x27;s X, as well as Marcus Durant and Don Was. Pinnick was eventually replaced by Faith No More bassist Billy Gould. Thompson did not take part in the MC50 tour, which concluded in Christchurch, New Zealand in February 2020.

In 2022, Kramer announced that a tour under the banner of &quot;We Are All MC5&quot; would take place that spring, and that a new MC5 studio album with veteran producer Bob Ezrin would also be released later that year with original MC5 drummer Dennis Thompson playing on two tracks. Joining Kramer on &quot;The Heavy Lifting Tour&quot; is singer Brad Brooks, guitarist Stevie Salas, bassist Vicki Randle, and drummer Winston Watson, who replaces originally named drummer Stephen Perkins. In addition to San Francisco Bay area singer-songwriter Brooks, Native American Salas is a former advisor of contemporary music at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, Randle is known as the first permanent female member of The Tonight Show Band from 1992 to 2010, and Watson performed 400 shows with Bob Dylan from 1992 over five years of his Never Ending Tour. In 2023, Kramer announced that the new album would be released in the spring of 2024.

On February 2, 2024, Kramer died after being diagnosed the previous month with pancreatic cancer. In April 2024, John Sinclair, who previously served as MC5&#x27;s manager and who was also instrumental in the band&#x27;s political activism, died as well.

In April 2024, the MC5 was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical excellence category.

Thompson died of a heart attack on May 8, 2024, at the age of 75. The MC5&#x27;s final album, &quot;Heavy Lifting&quot;, was posthumously released on October 18, 2024.

<text>Richard Bong State Recreation Area is a unit of the state park system of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It is located in the town of Brighton, in Kenosha County. This managed prairie contains of mountain bike trails. Other recreational activities include high power rocketry, swimming, dogsledding, falconry, ATV sports, land sailing, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, camping with amenities, and ultralight aviation. There is a wildlife preserve where great egrets, sandhill cranes, and great blue herons are known to nest. The Richard Bong SRA is one of the centerpieces of the proposed Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge.

==Richard Bong Air Force Base==
The park is on land once intended for the Richard Bong Air Force Base, whose namesake is World War II veteran aviator Maj. Richard Ira Bong. Part of what was intended to be the main airstrip is still visible from aerial photos of the site.

==Theft of signs==

Largely due to its name&#x27;s coincidental allusions to marijuana use, Bong Recreation Area is a frequent target of sign theft. This has led to the manufacturing of T-shirts and sweatshirts bearing the highway exit sign.

<doc id="146048" wikidata="Q42563" url="?curid=146048" title="Birman">
<text>The Birman, also called the &quot;Sacred Cat of Burma&quot;, is a domestic cat breed. The Birman is a long-haired, colour-pointed cat distinguished by a silky coat, deep blue eyes, and contrasting white &quot;gloves&quot; on each paw.

The breed name is derived from &quot;Birmanie&quot;, the French form of Burma. The breed was first recognised in 1925 in France.
==History==
No clear record of the breed&#x27;s origin exists. They are most often claimed to have originated as the companions of temple priests in northern Burma in the Mount of Lugh. Many stories exist of how the cats first came to France, including pairs of cats being given as a reward for helping defend a temple, or being smuggled out of Burma and Sweden by a Vanderbilt. Another pair of Birmans (or a pregnant female called &quot;Poupée de Maldapour&quot;) were said to have been stolen and later imported to France by Thadde Haddisch. The first traces of historical Birmans go back to a Mme Leotardi in Nice, France.

Birmans were almost wiped out as a breed during World War II. Only two cats were alive in Europe at the end of the war, a pair named Orloff and Xenia de Kaabaa, both belonging to Baudoin-Crevoisier. The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with long-hair breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966.

The first Birman cats were seal point. The blue point colour was introduced in 1959 using blue Persian lines. New colours were later added by English breeders including chocolate, red, and tabby/lynx points. Birmans have also been used in the development of new breeds such as the Ragdoll.
===Breed recognition===
The Birman breed was first recognized in France by the Cat Club de France in 1925, then in England by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1966 and in United States by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) in 1967. It was also recognized by the Canadian Cat Association (CCA) and the International Cat Association (TICA) in 1979.
==Appearance==

Birmans have a medium-sized, rectangular body with a broad face and distinct Roman nose. Their ears are ideally as wide on the base as they are tall and should be set as much on top of the head as on the side. The eyes are rounded and should be a deep sapphire blue.

The Birman&#x27;s fur is medium-long and should have a silky texture. Unlike a Persian or Himalayan, they have no undercoat, thus are much less prone to matting. Coat colour is always pointed, save for the contrasting pure white, symmetrical &quot;gloves&quot; on each paw that are the trademark of the breed. The white must involve all toes and in front must stop at the articulation or at the transition of toes to metacarpals. These gloves should extend noticeably further up the back of the leg (referred to as the &quot;laces&quot;), finishing with an inverted V extended half to three-fourths up the hock. Any other spot of white on the points is considered a serious fault. The base body colour is white to cream, with a wash of colour that corresponds to the points, but is much paler.

Recognized point colours are seal, chocolate, red and the corresponding dilute varieties: blue, lilac and cream. Tabby and tortie variations in seal, chocolate, blue or lilac are also allowed; other colours are in development.


==Genetic diversity==
A 2008 study by Lipinski&quot; et al.&quot; found that the Birman has one of the lowest levels of genetic diversity of all the breeds studied. 

==Health==
A study in the UK of veterinary records found the Birman to have a life expectancy of 14.39 years based on a sample of 38 cats, higher than the 11.74 average overall.

Paltrinieri, Giraldi, Prolo, Scarpa, &quot;et al&quot;. (2017) found that Birman cats have a high serum concentration of creatinine and symmetric dimethylarginine, but most Birman cats have higher concentrations of creatinine than SDMA. Creatinine is a creatine phosphate and is produced during metabolism of creatine, and is excreted through urination. SDMA is a methylated form of the amino acid arginine and is released during normal catabolisms of body proteins. Levels of creatinine and SDMA are found when Birman cats are tested for chronic kidney disease, for which they are at high risk. Birman cats are also at risk of developing feline infectious peritonitis; a disease that alters the renal function (creatinine levels in blood and urine) in the cats. In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Birman was over-represented with an odds ratio of 6.77.

Feline audiogenic reflex seizures (FARS), a recently discovered type of epilepsy in cats, is believed to be particularly common in Birman cats.

==Birman naming conventions==
Many Birman breeders follow the French tradition of assigning all kittens born in a particular year given names that begin with the same letter of the alphabet. Countries with breeders using this convention include Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Kittens born in 2016 would start with &#x27;N&#x27;, and in 2017 &#x27;O&#x27;, and so on.

<text>David Gahan ( ; né Callcott; 9 May 1962) is an English singer best known as the lead singer of electronic music band Depeche Mode since their formation in 1980. Noted for his commanding stage presence and unique baritone voice, Gahan was ranked at No. 73 on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot; and No. 27 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Frontmen&quot;. As part of Depeche Mode, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

Gahan&#x27;s solo albums include &quot;Paper Monsters&quot; (2003) and &quot;Hourglass&quot; (2007). He also contributed lyrics and sang lead vocals on the Soulsavers albums &quot;The Light the Dead See&quot; (2012), &quot;Angels &amp; Ghosts&quot; (2015) and &quot;Imposter&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Gahan was born David Callcott on 9 May 1962 in Epping, Essex, the son of working-class parents. His mother, Sylvia, was a conductor on London buses, while his father, Len, was a bus driver of Malaysian descent. When he was six months old, his father left the family, and his parents divorced two years later. His mother moved him and his older sister Sue (born 1960) to Basildon, Essex, after marrying her second husband, Shell Oil administrator Jack Gahan; Jack adopted Susan and David. Through this marriage, he has two younger half-brothers named Peter (born 1966) and Phil (born 1968). While growing up, he and his sister were under the impression that their adoptive father was their biological father.

When Gahan was nine years old, Jack died, and Len returned and was introduced as &quot;Uncle&quot; Len. In a 1987 interview, Gahan recalled his experience: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget that day. When I came home from school, there was this stranger in my mum&#x27;s house. My mother introduced him to me as my real dad. I remember I said that was impossible because my father was dead. How was I supposed to know who that man was? From that day on, Len often visited the house, until one year later he disappeared again, forever this time.&quot;

While attending Barstable School in Basildon, Gahan started skipping school, getting into trouble with the police, and was suspended from school before ending up in juvenile court three times for offences ranging from joyriding and graffiti to criminal damage and theft. He enjoyed the thrill of stealing cars, driving them, and then setting them on fire. He said of this time in his life, &quot;I was pretty wild. I loved the excitement of nicking a motor, screeching off and being chased by the police. Hiding behind the wall with your heart beating gives you a real kick – &#x27;will they get you?&#x27;&quot;

During his final year of school, Gahan applied for a job as an apprentice fitter with North Thames Gas. His probation officer told him to be honest during the interview, leading him to tell the interviewer that he had a criminal record but claim he was a &quot;reformed character&quot;, which resulted in him being refused the job. He then trashed his probation officer&#x27;s office in retaliation, for which he was ordered to spend every Saturday for several weeks at an attendance centre in Romford for one year. He recalled, &quot;You had to work. I remember doing boxing, stuff like that. You had to have your hair cut. It was every weekend, so you were deprived of your weekend and it seemed like forever. I was told very clearly that my next thing was detention centre. To be honest, music saved me.&quot;

==Career==
===Depeche Mode (1980–present)===

In March 1980, Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Vince Clarke formed the band Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals and guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass. Clarke and Fletcher soon switched to synthesizers. The same year, Gahan joined the band after Clarke heard him perform David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;. The band was soon renamed &quot;Depeche Mode&quot;, a name suggested by Gahan after he had come across a fashion magazine called &quot;Dépêche-mode&quot;. A new wave/synth-pop pioneer of the early 1980s, Depeche Mode have released 15 studio albums, four greatest hits compilations and two remix albums. The band has achieved global sales in excess of 100 million records. Four of the band&#x27;s singles have reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart: &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (1990), &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; (1990), &quot;I Feel You&quot; (1993), and &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; (1993).

In a 2003 interview, Gahan shared that &quot;During the making of &quot;Exciter&quot;, sometimes I felt a bit frustrated that there was a lack of experimentation.&quot; This led him, in 2004, to tell his bandmates that he wanted to write half of the songs on their next album, and there was &quot;no way&quot; he could be involved in the band without contributing as a songwriter. Eventually, there was a compromise, and three of Gahan&#x27;s songs appeared on 2005&#x27;s &quot;Playing the Angel&quot;: &quot;Suffer Well&quot; (nominated for a Grammy award), &quot;I Want It All&quot; and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Impossible&quot;. &quot;Suffer Well&quot; was released as a single in 2006, reaching No. 12 in the UK. Gahan also wrote the lyrics to the B-side &quot;Oh Well&quot;, although the music was written by Martin Gore. It was their first writing collaboration.

Gahan&#x27;s persona onstage is influenced by Dave Vanian, frontman of the Damned. He has also credited Bowie, James Brown, Elvis Presley and Prince as influences.

===Solo albums and collaborations (2003–present)===
In 2003, Gahan released his first solo album, &quot;Paper Monsters&quot; (which he co-wrote with guitarist and friend Knox Chandler), followed by the &quot;Paper Monsters Tour&quot; (including a performance at 2003&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival), singing both his new solo tracks and Depeche Mode fan favourites. The album was a moderate success. The first single &quot;Dirty Sticky Floors&quot; hit the Top 20 in the UK singles chart. The album became a Top 10 hit on the European album chart and a Top 40 hit in the UK Albums Chart.

In 2007, Gahan announced he was working on a new album via a video greeting for Depeche Mode&#x27;s official website recorded at the 2007 MusiCares Charity event on 11 May. The album, entitled &quot;Hourglass&quot;, was accompanied working by Andrew Phillpott and Christian Eigner. The material was recorded at Gahan&#x27;s 11th Floor Studios in New York City. According to Gahan, &quot;Hourglass&quot; is more electronic-sounding than &quot;Paper Monsters&quot;. The album made the UK Top 50, the French Top 20 and narrowly missed going to No. 1 in Germany. The first single to be pulled from &quot;Hourglass&quot; was &quot;Kingdom&quot;.

In July 2007, &quot;Side-Line&quot; magazine revealed that Gahan had been working with Thomas Anselmi on a project called Mirror, which was produced by Vincent Jones. Along with Jones, who played with Gahan&#x27;s touring band and mixed the live DVD &quot;Live Monsters&quot;, Mirror featured another Gahan collaborator, Knox Chandler (Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees, the Psychedelic Furs), as well as piano by Bowie favourite Mike Garson, and a monologue by Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro. Gahan sang vocals on the track &quot;Nostalgia&quot;. The song was released in October 2008, and the album released via download at the start of 2009. He also appeared in the accompanying video for the song.

Gahan also contributed vocals to a track called &quot;Visitors&quot;, after walking in while producer and ex-Clor guitarist Luke Smith was working on the song in his New York studio. The song was released under the artist name of frYars.

Gahan is the lead singer and lyricist on Soulsavers&#x27; fourth studio album &quot;The Light the Dead See&quot;. The album was released on 21 May 2012.

Gahan sings and plays harmonica on &quot;Low Guns&quot;, the first single from the 2014 album &quot;The Morning After&quot; by English band SixToes. The single was released on 18 November 2013. The SixToes remix of &quot;Jezebel&quot; was released on the special edition of &quot;Sounds of the Universe&quot; in 2009. Members of SixToes also collaborated with Soulsavers, on the album &quot;The Light the Dead See&quot;. 

In 2015, Gahan collaborated again with Soulsavers as the main singer on the album &quot;Angels &amp; Ghosts&quot;. The lead single from the album titled &quot;All of This and Nothing&quot; was released digitally 11 September 2015. 

In 2017, Gahan featured on Null + Void&#x27;s song &quot;Where I Wait&quot; from the album &quot;Cryosleep&quot; where the song features three times in different remixes.

In 2018, a remix of the Goldfrapp single &quot;Ocean&quot; featuring guest vocals from Gahan was released as a digital download on 21 May 2018. Regarding the collaboration, the Goldfrapp issued a statement: &quot;Working with Dave Gahan on the new version of &#x27;Ocean&#x27; had been a real honor for us as a band.&quot;

In 2021, Gahan contributed a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot; and did guest vocals on a single from Jenny Lee Lindberg. On November 12, 2021, Gahan released an album of covers called &quot;Imposter&quot; with Soulsavers.

In 2023, Gahan contributed a cover of &quot;Mother of Earth&quot; by the Gun Club to the fourth installment in the &quot;Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project&quot; series of tribute albums, titled &quot;The Task Has Overwhelmed Us&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gahan has lived in New York City since 1997. He is married to his third wife, Greek-American actress and filmmaker Jennifer Sklias, with whom he has a daughter, Stella Rose (born in 1999), who is also a singer. He also adopted her son from a previous relationship, and has a son named Jack from his first marriage to Joanne Fox. His second marriage, to former Depeche Mode publicist Teresa Conroy, lasted for four years.

Gahan converted to the Greek Orthodox Church before marrying Sklias. In a 2008 interview, he said, &quot;When it comes to religion, it&#x27;s very confusing and always has been for thousands of years and probably will be for thousands of years more. I don&#x27;t know what it is I believe in, but I know that I feel a sense of some kind of higher power, for lack of better words.&quot;

In a 1997 interview, Gahan referred to himself as &quot;classically ADD&quot;. In a 2017 interview, he described himself and bandmate Martin Gore as autistic.

===Health issues===
Gahan is a recovering heroin addict and has had multiple health concerns throughout his career. During his roughest years in Los Angeles, he survived four brushes with death and earned the nickname &quot;The Cat&quot; from local paramedics.

In October 1993, Gahan suffered a minor drug-induced heart attack during a performance in New Orleans, leaving the rest of Depeche Mode to improvise an encore without him.

In August 1995, Gahan attempted suicide by cutting his wrists, later explaining it as a &quot;cry for help&quot; and stating that he had &quot;made sure there were people who might find [him]&quot;.

In May 1996, Gahan overdosed on a speedball at the Sunset Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles, which resulted in his heart stopping for two minutes until he was revived by paramedics. He said he had an out-of-body experience: &quot;All I saw and all I felt at first was complete darkness. I&#x27;ve never been in a space that was blacker, and I remember feeling that whatever it was I was doing, it was really wrong. Then the next thing I remember was seeing myself on the floor, on the steps outside my hotel bathroom, and there was a lot of activity going on around me. In some ways it was very liberating. Then I came to and a cop was handcuffing me. It certainly wasn&#x27;t a place I&#x27;d like to visit again.&quot; Several months later, after facing drug charges, he checked himself into rehab.

In May 2009, shortly before Depeche Mode were due onstage in Athens during their Tour of the Universe, Gahan became ill in his dressing room. He was rushed to hospital, where it was suspected he was suffering from a bout of gastroenteritis. A scan revealed a malignant tumour in his bladder, which was removed. Several shows were postponed and he underwent cancer treatments during the remaining three months of the tour.

In July 2009, Gahan suffered a torn calf muscle while performing in Bilbao, resulting in two further show cancellations. After a two-week break, he and Depeche Mode returned to the tour for their North American leg. While performing in Seattle the following month, Gahan strained his vocal cords and doctors ordered him to undertake complete vocal rest, resulting in two more cancelled shows.

In May 2011, Gahan was honoured at the seventh annual MusiCares MAP Fund Benefit Concert for more than a decade of sobriety.

<text>The virgin birth of Jesus is the Christian and Islamic teaching that Jesus was conceived by his mother, Mary, through the power of the Holy Spirit and without sexual intercourse. 

Christians regard the doctrine as an explanation of the combination of the human and divine natures of Jesus. The Eastern Orthodox Churches accept the doctrine as authoritative by reason of its inclusion in the Nicene Creed, and the Catholic Church holds it authoritative for faith through the Apostles&#x27; Creed as well as the Nicene. Nevertheless, there are many contemporary churches in which it is considered orthodox to accept the virgin birth but not heretical to deny it.

In the New Testament, the narrative appears only in and , and the modern scholarly consensus is that it rests on slender historical foundations, though conservative scholars maintain its historicity. The ancient world did not possess a thoroughly modern understanding that male semen and female ovum were both needed to form an embryo; this cultural milieu was conducive to miraculous birth stories, and tales of virgin birth and the impregnation of mortal women by deities were well known in the 1st-century Greco-Roman world and Second Temple Jewish works.

The Quran asserts the virgin birth of Jesus, deriving its narrative from the 2nd-century AD Protoevangelium of James, but rejects the Trinitarian interpretation of the Christian account, emphasising that Jesus was a human messenger of God rather than divine.

==New Testament narratives: Matthew and Luke==

===Matthew 1:18-25===
18: Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
19: Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly.
20: But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
21: She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&quot;
22: All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 
23: &quot;Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,&quot; which means, &quot;God is with us.&quot; 
24: When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, 
25: but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.
===Luke 1:26-38===
26: In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
27: to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin&#x27;s name was Mary.
28: And he came to her and said, &quot;Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.&quot;
29: But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
30: The angel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
31: And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.
32: He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. 
33: He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&quot;
34: Mary said to the angel, &quot;How can this be, since I am a virgin?&quot;
35: The angel said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.
36: And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren.
37: For nothing will be impossible with God.&quot;
38: Then Mary said, &quot;Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.&quot; Then the angel departed from her.
==Texts==
In the entire Christian corpus, the virgin birth is found only in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. The two agree that Mary&#x27;s husband was named Joseph, that he was of the Davidic line, and that he played no role in Jesus&#x27;s divine conception, but beyond this they are very different. Matthew has no census, shepherds, or presentation in the temple, and implies that Joseph and Mary are living in Bethlehem at the time of the birth, while Luke has no magi, flight into Egypt or massacre of the infants, and states that Joseph lives in Nazareth.

Matthew underlines the virginity of Mary by references to the Book of Isaiah (using the Greek translation in the Septuagint, rather than the Hebrew Masoretic Text) and by his narrative statement that Joseph had no sexual relations with her until after the birth, a choice of words which leaves open the possibility that they did have relations after that.Luke introduces Mary as a virgin, describes her puzzlement at being told she will bear a child despite her lack of sexual experience, and informs the reader that this pregnancy is to be effected through God&#x27;s Holy Spirit.

There is a serious debate as to whether Luke&#x27;s nativity story is an original part of his gospel. Chapters 1 and 2 are written in a style quite different from the rest of the gospel, and the dependence of the birth narrative on the Greek Septuagint is absent from the remainder. There are strong Lukan motifs in Luke 1–2, but differences are equally striking—Jesus&#x27;s identity as &quot;son of David&quot;, for example, is a prominent theme of the birth narrative, but not in the rest of the gospel. In the early part of the 2nd century, the gnostic theologian Marcion produced a version of Luke lacking these two chapters, and although he is generally accused of having cut them out of a longer text more like our own, genealogies and birth narratives are also absent from Mark and John.

==Cultural context==

Matthew 1:18 says that Mary was betrothed to Joseph. She would have been twelve years old or a little less at the time of events described in the gospels, as under Jewish law betrothal was only possible for minors, which for girls meant aged under twelve or prior to the first menses, whichever came first. According to custom the wedding would take place twelve months later, after which the groom would take his bride from her father&#x27;s house to his own. A betrothed girl who had sex with a man other than her husband-to-be was considered an adulteress. If tried before a tribunal, both she and the young man would be stoned to death, but it was possible for her betrothed husband to issue a document of repudiation, and this, according to Matthew, was the course Joseph wished to take prior to the visitation by the angel.

The most likely cultural context for both Matthew and Luke is Jewish Christian or mixed Gentile/Jewish-Christian circles rooted in Jewish tradition. These readers would have known that the Roman Senate had declared Julius Caesar a god and his successor Augustus to be &quot;divi filius&quot;, the Son of God before he became a god himself on his death in AD 14; this remained the pattern for later emperors. Imperial divinity was accompanied by suitable miraculous birth stories, with Augustus being fathered by the god Apollo while his human mother slept, and her human husband being granted a dream in which he saw the sun rise from her womb, and inscriptions even described the news of the divine imperial birth as &quot;evangelia&quot;, the gospel. The virgin birth of Jesus was thus a direct challenge to a central claim of Roman imperial theology, namely the divine conception and descent of the emperors.

Matthew&#x27;s genealogy, tracing Jesus&#x27;s Davidic descent, was intended for Jews, while his virgin birth story was intended for a Greco-Roman audience familiar with virgin birth stories and stories of women impregnated by gods. The ancient world had no understanding that male semen and female ovum were both needed to form a fetus; instead they thought that the male contribution in reproduction consisted of some sort of formative or generative principle, while Mary&#x27;s bodily fluids would provide all the matter that was needed for Jesus&#x27;s bodily form, including his male sex. This cultural milieu was conducive to miraculous birth stories – they were common in biblical tradition going back to Abraham and Sarah (and the conception of Isaac).

Such stories are less frequent in Judaism, but there too was a widespread belief in angels and divine intervention in births. Theologically, the two accounts mark the moment when Jesus becomes the Son of God, i.e., at his birth, in distinction to Mark, for whom the Sonship dates from Jesus&#x27;s baptism, and Paul and the pre-Pauline Christians for whom Jesus becomes the Son only at the Resurrection or even the Second Coming.

Tales of virgin birth and the impregnation of mortal women by deities were well known in the 1st-century Greco-Roman world, and Second Temple Jewish works were also capable of producing accounts of the appearances of angels and miraculous births for ancient heroes such as Melchizedek, Noah, and Moses. Luke&#x27;s virgin birth story is a standard plot from the Jewish scriptures, as for example in the annunciation scenes for Isaac and for Samson, in which an angel appears and causes apprehension, the angel gives reassurance and announces the coming birth, the mother raises an objection, and the angel gives a sign. Nevertheless, &quot;plausible sources that tell of virgin birth in areas convincingly close to the gospels&#x27; own probable origins have proven extremely hard to demonstrate&quot;. Similarly, while it is widely accepted that there is a connection with Zoroastrian sources underlying Matthew&#x27;s story of the Magi (the wise men from the East) and the Star of Bethlehem, a wider claim that Zoroastrianism formed the background to the infancy narratives has not achieved acceptance.

==Historicity and sources of the narratives==

The modern scholarly consensus is that the doctrine of the virgin birth rests on very slender historical foundations. Both Matthew and Luke are late and anonymous compositions dating from the period AD 80–90, though this still places them within the lifetimes of various eyewitnesses, including Jesus&#x27;s own family. Marcus Borg stated plainly, &quot;I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual.&quot; 

The earliest Christian writings, the Pauline epistles, do not contain any mention of a virgin birth and simply state that he was &quot;born of a woman&quot; and &quot;born under the law&quot; like any Jew. In the Gospel of Mark, dating from around AD 70, we read of Jesus saying that &quot;prophets are not without honour, except in their home town, and among their own kin, and in their own house&quot; – , which may suggest that Mark was not aware of any tradition of special circumstances surrounding Jesus&#x27; birth. 

Though the author of the Gospel of John is confident that Jesus is more than human, he makes no reference to a virgin birth to prove his point. John in fact refers twice to Jesus as the &quot;son of Joseph,&quot; the first time from the lips of the disciple Philip (&quot;We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus, son of Joseph from Nazareth&quot; – ), the second from the unbelieving Jews (&quot;Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose mother and father we know?&quot; – John ). These quotations, incidentally, appear to be in direct opposition to the suggestion that Jesus was, or was believed to be, illegitimate: Philip and the Jews knew that Jesus had a human father, and that father was Joseph.

This raises the question of where the authors of Matthew and Luke found their stories. It is almost certain that neither was the work of an eyewitness, though the oral transmission that led to the Gospels would have involved eyewitnesses. In view of the many inconsistencies between their narratives of Jesus&#x27; birth, neither is likely to derive from the other, nor did they share a common source. Raymond E. Brown suggested in 1973 that Joseph was the source of Matthew&#x27;s account and Mary of Luke&#x27;s, but modern scholars consider this &quot;highly unlikely&quot; given that the stories emerged so late. It follows that the two narratives were created by the two writers, drawing on ideas in circulation at least a decade before the gospels were composed, to perhaps 65-75 or even earlier.

Matthew presents the ministry of Jesus as largely the fulfilment of prophecies from the Book of Isaiah, and Matthew 1:22-23, &quot;All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: &#x27;Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son..., is a reference to Isaiah 7:14, &quot;...the Lord himself shall give you a sign: the maiden is with child and she will bear a son...&quot; The Book of Isaiah had been translated into Greek, and from this translation, Matthew uses the Greek word (&quot;parthenos&quot;), which does mean virgin, for the Hebrew (&quot;almah&quot;), which scholars agree signifies a girl of childbearing age without reference to virginity. This mistranslation gave the author of Matthew the opportunity to interpret Jesus as the prophesied &quot;Immanuel&quot;, &quot;God is with us&quot;, the divine representative on earth. According to R. T. France, the inclusion of Isaiah 7:14 was an explanatory addition to Matthew&#x27;s birth narrative, albeit not the inspiration for it. According to Mark Goodacre, the Gospel of Matthew did not base the virgin birth on a mistranslation of Isaiah.

Conservative scholars argue that despite the uncertainty of the details, the gospel birth narratives trace back to historical, or at least much earlier pre-gospel traditions. For instance, according to Ben Witherington:
==Theology and development==
Matthew and Luke use the virgin birth (or more accurately the divine conception that precedes it) to mark the moment when Jesus becomes the Son of God. This was a notable development over Mark, for whom the Sonship dates from Jesus&#x27;s baptism, and the earlier Christianity of Paul and the pre-Pauline Christians for whom Jesus becomes the Son at the Resurrection or even the Second Coming. The Ebionites, a Jewish Christian sect, saw Jesus as fully human, rejected the virgin birth, and preferred to translate &quot;almah&quot; as &quot;young woman&quot;. The 2nd century gnostic theologian Marcion likewise rejected the virgin birth, but regarded Jesus as descended fully formed from heaven and having only the appearance of humanity. By about AD 180 some Jews suggested that Jesus had been illegitimately conceived by a Roman soldier named Pantera or Pandera, whose name is likely a pun on &quot;parthenos&quot;, virgin. The story was still current in the Middle Ages in satirical parody of the Christian gospels called the Toledot Yeshu. The Toledot Yeshu contains little historical material, and was probably created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.

According to Kärkkäinen, the virgin birth in relation to the incarnation was seen as proof of the divinity of Christ but that the Age of Enlightenment offered a full-scale rebuttal of the doctrine, and that the only way for classical liberals to continue believing the virgin birth was to resort to the notion of myth, though this elicited a vigorous reaction from conservatives. This division remains in place, although some national synods of the Catholic Church have replaced a biological understanding with the idea of &quot;theological truth,&quot; and some evangelical theologians hold it to be marginal rather than indispensable to the Christian faith. Today, the traditional doctrine of the virgin birth is still defended by conservative theologians.

==Celebrations and devotions==
Some Christians celebrate the conception of Jesus on 25 March and his birth on 25 December. (These dates are traditional; no one knows for certain when Jesus was born.) The Magnificat, based on Luke 1:46-55 is one of four well known Gospel canticles: the Benedictus and the Magnificat in the first chapter, and the Gloria in Excelsis and the Nunc dimittis in the second chapter of Luke, which are now an integral part of the Christian liturgical tradition. The Annunciation became an element of Marian devotions in medieval times, and by the 13th century direct references to it were widespread in French lyrics. The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the title &quot;Ever Virgin Mary&quot; as a key element of its Marian veneration, and as part of the Akathists hymns to Mary which are an integral part of its liturgy.

The doctrine is often represented in Christian art in terms of the annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God, and in Nativity scenes that include the figure of Salome. The Annunciation is one of the most frequently depicted scenes in Western art. Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art. The depiction of Joseph turning away in some Nativity scenes is a discreet reference to the fatherhood of the Holy Spirit and the virgin birth.

==In Islam==

The Quran follows the apocryphal gospels, and especially in the Protoevangelium of James, in its accounts of the miraculous births of both Mary and her son Jesus, but while it affirms the virgin birth of Jesus it denies the Trinitarian implications of the gospel story (Jesus is a messenger of God but also a human being and not the second person of the Christian Trinity). , for example, follows the Protoevangelium closely when describing how the pregnant &quot;wife of Imran&quot; (that is, Mary&#x27;s mother) dedicates her unborn child to God, Mary&#x27;s secluded upbringing within the Temple, and the angels who bring her food.

<text>Pili multigemini, also known as &quot;compound hairs,&quot; is a malformation characterized by the presence of bifurcated or multiple divided hair matrices and papillae, giving rise to the formation of multiple hair shafts within the individual follicles.

== Description ==

The name describes a condition where several separate hair fibers bunch together and emerge from the skin through a single hair canal. Pathology shows that deep in the skin several dermal papillae are closely situated with each producing a fiber, but these separate hair follicle bulbs combine into one hair canal towards the skin surface. Folliculitis can sometimes be associated with this condition.

== Treatment ==
Electrolysis will permanently remove pili multigemini.
Depilating laser treatment has been suggested to improve symptomatic pili multigemini.

<doc id="146062" wikidata="Q1121101" url="?curid=146062" title="Synchronicity">
<text>Synchronicity () is a concept introduced by founder of analytical psychology Carl Jung to describe events that coincide in time and appear meaningfully related, yet lack a discoverable causal connection. Jung held this was a healthy function of the mind, that can become harmful within psychosis.

Jung developed the theory as a hypothetical noncausal principle serving as the intersubjective or philosophically objective connection between these seemingly meaningful coincidences. After coining the term in the late 1920s Jung developed the concept with physicist Wolfgang Pauli through correspondence and in their 1952 work &quot;The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche&quot;. This culminated in the Pauli–Jung conjecture.
Jung and Pauli&#x27;s view was that, just as causal connections can provide a meaningful understanding of the psyche and the world, so too may acausal connections.

A 2016 study found 70% of therapists agreed synchronicity experiences could be useful for therapy. Analytical psychologists hold that individuals must understand the compensatory meaning of these experiences to &quot;enhance consciousness rather than merely build up superstitiousness&quot;. However, clients who disclose synchronicity experiences report not being listened to, accepted, or understood. The experience of overabundance of meaningful coincidences can be characteristic of schizophrenic delusion.

Jung used synchronicity in arguing for the existence of the paranormal. This idea was explored by Arthur Koestler in &quot;The Roots of Coincidence&quot; and taken up by the New Age movement. Unlike magical thinking, which believes causally unrelated events to have paranormal causal connection, synchronicity supposes events may be causally unrelated yet have unknown noncausal connection.

The objection from a scientific standpoint is that this is neither testable nor falsifiable, so does not fall within empirical study. Scientific scepticism regards it as pseudoscience. Jung stated that synchronicity events are chance occurrences from a statistical point of view, but meaningful in that they may seem to validate paranormal ideas. No empirical studies of synchronicity based on observable mental states and scientific data were conducted by Jung to draw his conclusions, though studies have since been done . While someone may experience a coincidence as meaningful, this alone cannot prove objective meaning to the coincidence.

Statistical laws or probability, show how unexpected occurrences can be inevitable or more likely encountered than people assume. These explain coincidences such as synchronicity experiences as chance events which have been misinterpreted by confirmation biases, spurious correlations, or underestimated probability.

== Origins ==
Synchronicity arose with Jung&#x27;s use of the ancient Chinese divination text &quot;I Ching&quot;. It has 64 hexagrams, each built from two trigrams or bagua. A divination is made by seemingly random numerical happenings for which the &quot;I Ching&quot; text gives detailed situational analysis. Richard Wilhelm, translator of Chinese, provided Jung with validation. Jung met Wilhelm in Darmstadt, Germany where Hermann von Keyserling hosted &quot;Gesellschaft für Freie Philosophie&quot;. In 1923 Wilhelm was in Zurich, as was Jung, attending the psychology club, where Wilhelm promulgated the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Finally,

Jung coined the term &quot;synchronicity&quot; as part of a lecture in May 1930, or as early as 1928, at first for use in discussing Chinese religious and philosophical concepts. His first public articulation of the term came in 1930 at the memorial address for Richard Wilhelm where Jung stated:

The &quot;I Ching&quot; is one of the five classics of Confucianism. By selecting a passage according to the traditional chance operations such as tossing coins and counting out yarrow stalks, the text is supposed to give insights into a person&#x27;s inner states. Jung characterised this as the belief in synchronicity, and himself believed the text to give apt readings in his own experiences. He would later also recommend this practice to certain of his patients. Jung argued that synchronicity could be found diffused throughout Chinese philosophy more broadly and in various Taoist concepts. Jung also drew heavily from German philosophers Gottfried Leibniz, whose own exposure to &quot;I Ching&quot; divination in the 17th century was the primary precursor to the theory of synchronicity in the West, Arthur Schopenhauer, whom Jung placed alongside Leibniz as the two philosophers most influential to his formulation of the concept, and Johannes Kepler. He points to Schopenhauer, especially, as providing an early conception of synchronicity in the quote:

As with Paul Kammerer&#x27;s theory of seriality developed in the late 1910s, Jung looked to hidden structures of nature for an explanation of coincidences. In 1932, physicist Wolfgang Pauli and Jung began what would become an extended correspondence in which they discussed and collaborated on various topics surrounding synchronicity, contemporary science, and what is now known as the Pauli effect. Jung also built heavily upon the idea of numinosity, a concept originating in the work of German religious scholar Rudolf Otto, which describes the feeling of &quot;gravitas&quot; found in religious experiences, and which perhaps brought greatest criticism upon Jung&#x27;s theory. Jung also drew from parapsychologist J. B. Rhine whose work in the 1930s had at the time to validate certain claims about extrasensory perception. It was not until a 1951 Eranos conference lecture, after having gradually developed the concept for over two decades, that Jung gave his first major outline of synchronicity. The following year, Jung and Pauli published their 1952 work &quot;The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche&quot; (), which contained Jung&#x27;s central monograph on the subject, &quot;Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle&quot;.

Other notable influences and precursors to synchronicity can be found in: the theological concept of correspondences, sympathetic magic, astrology, and alchemy.

=== Pauli–Jung conjecture ===

The Pauli–Jung conjecture is a collaboration in metatheory between physicist Wolfgang Pauli and analytical psychologist Carl Jung, centered on the concept of . It was mainly developed between the years 1946 and 1954, four years before Pauli&#x27;s death, and speculates on a perspective within the disciplines of both collaborators. Pauli additionally drew on various elements of quantum theory such as complementarity, nonlocality, and the observer effect in his contributions to the project. Jung and Pauli thereby &quot;offered the radical and brilliant idea that the currency of these correlations is not (quantitative) statistics, as in quantum physics, but (qualitative) meaning&quot;.

Contemporary physicist T. Filk writes that quantum entanglement, being &quot;a particular type of acausal quantum correlations&quot;, was plausibly taken by Pauli as &quot;a model for the relationship between mind and matter in the framework [...] he proposed together with Jung&quot;. Specifically, quantum entanglement may be the physical phenomenon which most closely represents the concept of synchronicity.

== Analytical psychology ==
In analytical psychology, the recognition of seemingly-meaningful coincidences is a mechanism by which unconscious material is brought to the attention of the conscious mind. A harmful or developmental outcome can then result only from the individual&#x27;s response to such material. Jung proposed that the concept could have psychiatric use in mitigating the negative effects of over-rationalisation and proclivities towards mind–body dualism.

Analytical psychology considers modern modes of thought to rest upon the pre-modern and primordial structures of the psyche. Causal connections thus form the basis of modern worldviews, and connections which lack causal reasoning are seen as . This chance-based interpretation, however, is incongruent with the primordial mind, which instead interprets this category as . The primordial framework in fact places emphasis on these connections, just as the modern framework emphasizes causal ones. In this regard, causality, like synchronicity, is a human interpretation imposed onto external phenomena. Primordial modes of thought are however, according to Jung, necessary constituents of the modern psyche that inevitably protrude into modern life—providing the basis for meaningful interpretation of the world by way of meaning-based connections. Just as the principles of psychological causality provide meaningful understanding of causal connections, so too the principle of synchronicity attempts to provide meaningful understanding of acasual connections. Jung placed synchronicity as one of three main conceptual elements in understanding the psyche:

# , as understood in Freudian theory, by which repressed libidinal energy is discharged across the psyche in response to principles of cause and effect—though Jung broadened this to a more generalized mental energy that is &quot;particular to the unfolding of the individual psyche&quot;
# , by which self-actualisation is an element of the psyche as potential
# , or meaningful chance, by which the potential for self-actualisation is either enhanced or negated

Jung felt synchronicity to be a principle that had explanatory power towards his concepts of archetypes and the collective unconscious. It described a governing dynamic which underlies the whole of human experience and history—social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. The emergence of the synchronistic paradigm was a significant move away from Cartesian dualism towards an underlying philosophy of double-aspect theory. Some argue this shift was essential in bringing theoretical coherence to Jung&#x27;s earlier work.

== Philosophy of science ==

Jung held that there was both a philosophical and scientific basis for synchronicity. He identified the complementary nature of causality and acausality with Eastern sciences and protoscientific disciplines, stating &quot;the East bases much of its science on this irregularity and considers coincidences as the reliable basis of the world rather than causality. Synchronism is the prejudice of the East; causality is the modern prejudice of the West&quot; (see also: universal causation). Contemporary scholar L. K. Kerr writes:

It is also pointed out that, since Jung took into consideration only the narrow definition of causality—only the efficient cause—his notion of &quot;acausality&quot; is also narrow and so is not applicable to final and formal causes as understood in Aristotelian or Thomist systems. Either the final causality is inherent in synchronicity, as it leads to individuation; or synchronicity can be a kind of replacement for final causality. However, such finalism or teleology is considered to be outside the domain of modern science.

Jung&#x27;s theory, and philosophical worldview implicated by it, includes not only mainstream science thoughts but also esoteric ones and ones that are against mainstream.

== Paranormal ==

Jung&#x27;s use of the concept in arguing for the existence of paranormal phenomena has been widely considered pseudoscientific by modern scientific scepticism. Furthermore, his collaborator Wolfgang Pauli objected to his dubious experiments of the concept involving astrology—which Jung believed to be supported by the laboratory experiments behind the uncertainty principle&#x27;s formulation. Jung similarly turned to the works of parapsychologist Joseph B. Rhine to support a connection between synchronicity and the paranormal. In his book &quot;&quot;, Jung wrote:

How are we to recognize acausal combinations of events, since it is obviously impossible to examine all chance happenings for their causality? The answer to this is that acausal events may be expected most readily where, on closer reflection, a causal connection appears to be inconceivable.

It is impossible, with our present resources, to explain ESP [extrasensory perception], or the fact of meaningful coincidence, as a phenomenon of energy. This makes an end of the causal explanation as well, for &quot;effect&quot; cannot be understood as anything except a phenomenon of energy. Therefore it cannot be a question of cause and effect, but of a falling together in time, a kind of simultaneity. Because of this quality of simultaneity, I have picked on the term &quot;synchronicity&quot; to designate a hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation.

Roderick Main, in the introduction to his 1997 book &quot;Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal&quot;, wrote:

== Studies ==

* A 1989 overview of research areas and methodology in the study of coincidence published by the &quot;Journal of the American Statistical Association&quot; addresses various potentials in researching synchronicity experiences.

* A 2009 paper found that, clinically, synchronicity experiences seem to cluster around periods of emotional intensity or major life transitions, such as births, deaths, and marriage.
* A 2016 study found that clients who have disclosed synchronicity experiences in clinical setting often report not being listened to, accepted, or understood. The study also found that for therapists these experiences often come as a shock and a challenge to their own worldviews, prompting researchers to specify a need to provide accurate and reliable information about synchronicity experiences for mental health professionals.
* Another 2016 study of 226 therapists found that 44% reported synchronicity experiences in the therapeutic setting, and 67% felt that synchronicity experiences could be useful for therapy. The study also points out ways of explanations of synchronicity: 
* A 2018 study shows that the concept of synchronicity finds clinical application in psychotherapies in form of a Jungian-specific approach to interpretation. Already the conceptual idea of synchronicity offers the therapist an additional therapeutic tool to put potentially meaningful experienced coincidences between him and the patient into a subjective narrative, which can be experienced by the patient as meaningful. If a synchronistic moment is sensitively recognized, thematized and interpreted as such, it can have positive consequences for the therapeutic relationship and therapy.
* A 2020 review summarized research into synchronicity, including investigations of statistical patterns like Fibonacci time intervals that might influence the frequency of meaningful coincidences. The review highlighted that such events appear to occur more often than random chance would suggest, raising questions about conventional probability theories and suggesting new avenues for scientific exploration.

== Scientific reception ==
Since their inception, Jung&#x27;s theories of synchronicity have been highly controversial and have never had widespread scientific approval. Scientific scepticism regards them as pseudoscience. Likewise, mainstream science does not support paranormal explanations of coincidences.

Despite this, synchronicity experiences and the synchronicity principle continue to be studied within philosophy, cognitive science, and analytical psychology. Synchronicity is widely challenged by the sufficiency of probability theory in explaining the occurrence of coincidences, the relationship between synchronicity experiences and cognitive biases, and doubts about the theory&#x27;s psychiatric or scientific usefulness.

Psychologist Fritz Levi, a contemporary of Jung, criticised the theory in his 1952 review, published in the periodical (&quot;New Swiss Observations&quot;). Levi saw Jung&#x27;s theory as vague in determinability of synchronistic events, saying that Jung never specifically explained his rejection of &quot;magic causality&quot; to which such an acausal principle as synchronicity would be related. He also questioned the theory&#x27;s usefulness.

In a 1981 paper, parapsychologist Charles Tart writes:

Robert Todd Carroll, author of &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in 2003, argues that synchronicity experiences are better explained as apophenia—the tendency for humans to find significance or meaning where none exists. He states that over a person&#x27;s lifetime one can be expected to encounter several seemingly-unpredictable coincidences and that there is no need for Jung&#x27;s metaphysical explanation of these occurrences.

In a 2014 interview, emeritus professor and statistician David J. Hand states:

In a 2015 paper, scholars M. K. Johansen and M. Osman state:

== Examples ==

=== Jung ===

Jung tells the following story as an example of a synchronistic event in his 1960 book &quot;Synchronicity&quot;:

After describing some examples, Jung wrote: &quot;When coincidences pile up in this way, one cannot help being impressed by them—for the greater the number of terms in such a series, or the more unusual its character, the more improbable it becomes.&quot;

=== Deschamps ===
French writer Émile Deschamps claims in his memoirs that, in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete—and in the same instant, the now-senile de Fontgibu entered the room, having got the wrong address.

=== Pauli ===
In his book &quot;Thirty Years That Shook Physics: The Story of Quantum Theory&quot; (1966), George Gamow writes about Wolfgang Pauli, who was apparently considered a person particularly associated with synchronicity events. Gamow whimsically refers to the &quot;Pauli effect&quot;, a mysterious phenomenon which is not understood on a purely materialistic basis, and probably never will be. The following anecdote is told:

== In popular culture ==
Philip K. Dick makes reference to &quot;Pauli&#x27;s synchronicity&quot; in his 1963 science-fiction novel, &quot;The Game-Players of Titan&quot;, in reference to pre-cognitive psionic abilities being interfered with by other psionic abilities such as psychokinesis: &quot;an acausal connective event&quot;.

In 1983 The Police released an album titled &quot;Synchronicity&quot;. A song from the album, &quot;Synchronicity II&quot;, simultaneously describes the story of a man experiencing a mental breakdown and a lurking monster emerging from a Scottish lake.

Björk wrote a song titled &quot;Synchronicity&quot; for Spike Jonze&#x27;s &quot;Hot Chocolate&quot; DVD.

Rising Appalachia released a song titled &quot;Synchronicity&quot; on their 2015 album &quot;Wider Circles&quot;.

<text>Leslie Ann Phillips (born January 28, 1962), better known by her stage name Sam Phillips, is an American singer and songwriter. Her albums include the critically acclaimed &quot;Martinis &amp; Bikinis&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Fan Dance&quot; in 2001. She has also composed scores for the television shows &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Bunheads&quot;, and &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;.

== Early life ==

Phillips was born in Glendale, California to parents William and Peggy Phillips. She is the second of three children and has a brother and a sister. She was given the nickname Sam, which would later become her stage name.

Phillips started singing at a young age, along with dancing, painting, and playing the piano. Phillips also started studying philosophy and fundamentalism at the age of 14. Phillips began writing songs as a teenager to cope with her parents&#x27; divorce.

== Career ==

Phillips began her musical career in the early 1980s in the contemporary Christian music industry, where she sang background vocals for Christian artists Mark Heard and Randy Stonehill.

Phillips was signed as a solo artist with Myrrh Records under her given name and recorded four Christian pop albums: &quot;Beyond Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Dancing with Danger&quot;, &quot;Black and White in a Grey World&quot;, and &quot;The Turning&quot;. &quot;The Turning&quot; teamed her with producer T Bone Burnett, who had worked with artists Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, and Roy Orbison. The two would later get married.

Several of Phillips&#x27; songs became Top 10 singles on Christian radio and Myrrh Records promoted her as &quot;the Christian Cyndi Lauper&quot;. Phillips was never comfortable with this image, and it was a bone of contention between her and her label. She began using the name &quot;Sam&quot; professionally in 1988 when she left Myrrh Records and signed with Virgin Records in order to distance herself from her prior persona.

With &quot;The Indescribable Wow&quot;, Philips moved into mainstream music. The album featured the orchestrations of Van Dyke Parks and took influence from 1960&#x27;s pop. &quot;Cruel Inventions&quot; was released in 1991, and included a guest performance by Elvis Costello. 1994&#x27;s &quot;Martinis and Bikinis&quot; was widely praised by music critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award, her second nomination (the first was as Leslie Phillips).

In 1995, Phillips made her film acting debut as the mute terrorist Katya in the Bruce Willis blockbuster &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;. In 1996, Phillips released &quot;Omnipop (It&#x27;s Only a Flesh Wound Lambchop)&quot;, which featured a song co-written by R.E.M. Phillips made a cameo appearance in the 1997 Wim Wenders film &quot;The End of Violence&quot;, singing part of the song &quot;Animals on Wheels&quot; from &quot;Omnipop&quot;. After releasing a contractually obligated &quot;best of&quot; album in 1999, Virgin Records dropped Phillips from its roster.

In 2001, Phillips signed with Nonesuch Records, evolving her musical style to a stripped-down, acoustically based sound on her album called &quot;Fan Dance&quot;, as well as guest appearances from musical partners Gillian Welch on vocals and David Rawlings on piano, for whom T Bone Burnett had produced several years earlier. Phillips also began writing music for and scoring the television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, and appeared in the final episode of season six, performing &quot;Taking Pictures&quot; from her &quot;Fan Dance&quot; album. In 2004, she released &quot;A Boot and a Shoe&quot;, another collection of acoustically based songs, similar in style to &quot;Fan Dance&quot;. In 2006 she was ranked at No. 94 on &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the top 100 living songwriters.

After the release of &quot;A Boot and a Shoe&quot;, Phillips and T Bone Burnett, who had been her longtime producer, divorced, although they continued to work together to finish her album. Her album &quot;Don&#x27;t Do Anything&quot; was self-produced and released in 2008.

In October 2009, Phillips launched &quot;The Long Play&quot;, a music subscription service offering digital releases without a record label. The first subscription only EP, &quot;Hypnotists in Paris&quot;, was recorded with the Section Quartet and a Christmas collection &quot;Cold Dark Night&quot;, &quot;Magic for Everyone&quot;, &quot;Old Tin Pan&quot;, and &quot;Days of the One Night Stands&quot; followed, with the full-length album Cameras in the Sky being released in early 2010. In Spring of 2011 she issued &quot;Solid State&quot;, a public CD release comprising 13 of the best songs from her subscription service.

In 2012, it was announced that she would be reunited with &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; creator Amy Sherman-Palladino by scoring music for the short-lived American TV show &quot;Bunheads&quot;.

Phillips described her next album, &quot;Pretty Time Bomb&quot; (later renamed &quot;Push Any Button&quot;), as being &quot;a nostalgic sort of dream of being a pop star in the 60s and early 70s. It&#x27;s a sweet kind of album and I don&#x27;t know where it came from. I don&#x27;t know what compelled me to make it. It&#x27;s probably a bad idea, but every time I listen to what I&#x27;ve done, it makes me really happy. So I figure, that must mean something and I should go ahead and put it out there.&quot;

&quot;Push Any Button&quot; was released on August 13, 2013. Phillips has described &quot;Push Any Button&quot; as &#x27;an impressionistic version of the AM pop radio playing inside her head&#x27;—a way of &#x27;looking at the future through the past. For the vinyl release through her website, Phillips created a limited run of unique handmade collages on repurposed vintage LP sleeves sourced from flea markets. In 2015, a suite of these collage artworks were exhibited at Gertrude Contemporary in Melbourne, Australia in an exhibition called &quot;Lost and Profound&quot; curated by Daniel Mudie Cunningham.

In 2013, Phillips&#x27; first live concert album, &quot;Sam Phillips: Live @ Largo at The Coronet&quot;, was made available digitally through her website, and is also the title of a 2019 documentary directed by Dave Rygalski, who filmed the 2013 performances.

On November 21, 2016, Phillips released an eight-track downloadable EP &quot;Human Contact is Never Easy&quot;, which included new tracks off her next album &quot;World on Sticks&quot;.

Phillips reunited with Amy Sherman-Palladino as composer for &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;, a revival of the television series, which was released on Netflix on November 25, 2016.

In September 2018, Phillips released &quot;World on Sticks&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 1989, Phillips married producer and musician T-Bone Burnett. Phillips and Burnett divorced in 2004; both have since remarried, Phillips to Eric Gorfain.

<text>Northwest Airlines (often abbreviated as NWA) was a major airline in the United States that operated from 1926 until it merged with Delta Air Lines in 2010. The merger made Delta the largest airline in the world until the American Airlines–US Airways merger in 2013.

Northwest was headquartered in Eagan, Minnesota, near Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. After World War II, it became dominant in the trans-Pacific market with a hub in Tokyo, Japan (initially Haneda Airport, later Narita International Airport). In response to United Airlines&#x27; 1985 acquisition of Pan Am&#x27;s Pacific routes, Northwest paid $884 million to purchase Republic Airlines and then established fortress hubs at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and Memphis International Airport. With this merger, NWA established the domestic network necessary to feed its well-established Pacific routes. Lacking a significant presence in Europe, in 1993 it began a strategic alliance with KLM and a jointly coordinated European hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.

Before its merger with Delta, Northwest was the world&#x27;s sixth-largest airline in domestic and international scheduled passenger miles flown and the US&#x27;s sixth-largest airline in domestic passenger miles flown. In addition to operating one of the largest domestic route networks in the U.S., Northwest carried more passengers across the Pacific Ocean (5.1 million in 2004) than any other U.S. carrier, and carried more domestic air cargo than any other American passenger airline.

Regional and commuter airline flights for Northwest were operated under the name Northwest Airlink by Big Sky Airlines, Eugene Aviation Services, Express Airlines I/II, Fischer Brothers Aviation, Mesaba Airlines, Northeast Express Regional Airlines, Pacific Island Aviation, Pinnacle Airlines, Precision Airlines, Simmons Airlines and Compass Airlines via respective code sharing agreements. Northwest Airlines was also a minority owner of Midwest Airlines, holding a 40% stake in the company.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Northwest Airlines was founded on September 1, 1926, by Colonel Lewis Brittin, under the name Northwest Airways, a reference to the historical name for the Midwestern United States that derived from the Northwest Territory. Like other early airlines, Northwest&#x27;s focus was not in hauling passengers, but in flying mail for the U.S. Post Office Department. The airline was originally based in Detroit, Michigan. The fledgling airline established a mail route between Minneapolis and Chicago, using open-cockpit biplanes such as the Curtiss Oriole and the Waco JYM. From 1928 the enclosed cabin six-passenger Hamilton H-45 and H-47 were used.


Northwest Airlines began carrying passengers in 1927; in 1928 Northwest started its first international route with service to Winnipeg. In 1929, a group headed by Richard Lilly, a businessman from St. Paul, Minnesota, purchased the airline.

In 1933 Northwest was selected to fly the &quot;Northern Transcontinental Route&quot; to Seattle, Washington. It adopted the name Northwest Airlines the following year after the Air Mail scandal. Northwest Airways, Inc. changed its name to Northwest Airlines, Inc. and the airline was incorporated under its new name in the State of Minnesota.

In 1939 Northwest had five daily flights from Chicago to Minneapolis; three continued west to Seattle through North Dakota and Montana. Northwest also served Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Portland, Oregon, by spurs from its transcontinental route. By the spring of 1948, Northwest was operating three different aircraft types: the 44-passenger seat Douglas DC-4, the 21-passenger seat Douglas DC-3 and the 36-passenger seat Martin 2-0-2.

===Transpacific network development===
In 1931, Northwest sponsored Charles and Anne Lindbergh on a pioneering test flight to Japan via Alaska, scouting what would become known as the Northwest Airlines&#x27; Great Circle route that could save on a New York to Tokyo flight. Northwest began to bolster the infrastructure on the domestic leg of this route during World War II when it flew soldiers and supplies from the Northwestern United States to Alaska. It was at this point that Northwest began painting its airliners&#x27; tails bright red as a visual aid in the often harsh weather conditions. The airline&#x27;s experience with the sub-arctic climate led the U.S. government to designate Northwest as the main airline over the North Pacific following the war.

In the spring of 1947, Northwest began stationing employees at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, flying them from the United States via Alaska on its Great Circle route. On July 15, 1947, Northwest was the first airline to begin direct service between the United States and Japan, using a Douglas DC-4 airliner named &quot;The Manila&quot;. (All pre-war airline service to East Asia had been via Hawaii and the Philippines.) The flight to Japan originated at Wold-Chamberlain Field in Minneapolis and stopped at Blatchford Field in Edmonton, Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage, and Shemya AAF in the western Aleutian Islands. The flight continued from Tokyo to Lunghwa Airport in Shanghai and then to Nichols Field at Manila.

A flight between Tokyo and Seoul (Gimpo Airport) began on October 20, 1947, and Naha Airport in Okinawa began to be a stop on the Tokyo to Manila route on November 16, 1947. Northwest service to Shanghai was suspended in May 1949 because of the civil war in China, with the Republic of China on the verge of collapse, and its government evacuated to the island of Formosa (Taiwan). Northwest Airlines added Songshan Airport in Taipei, the new capital city of the Republic of China, as a stop on the Tokyo-Okinawa-Manila route on June 3, 1950, with ongoing interchange service to Hong Kong operated by Hong Kong Airways.

===Northwest Orient Airlines===

With transpacific flights established, Northwest began branding as Northwest Orient Airlines between 1947 and 1986, although its registered corporate name remained &quot;Northwest Airlines.&quot;

NWA continuously upgraded equipment on the transpacific routes. On June 22, 1949, Northwest received its first double-decker Boeing 377 &quot;Stratocruiser&quot;, enabling more comfortable accommodations and faster transpacific flights. The Stratocruiser began flying from the West Coast to Honolulu in 1950 and to Tokyo via Alaska on September 27, 1952.　

In 1954, Northwest Orient purchased Douglas DC-6Bs and started flying them to Tokyo and Manila. In January 1960, Northwest was operating transcontinental Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop service nonstop between New York City and Seattle with these flights being part of the airline&#x27;s service between New York City and Asia with Douglas DC-7C aircraft being operated on the transpacific legs from Seattle and was also operating Electra propjet flights between Minneapolis/St. Paul, Milwaukee and Chicago Midway Airport in the north and several destinations in Florida in the south including Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa.On July 8, 1960, Northwest placed the Douglas DC-8 into service, offering the shortest flight times to East Asia, but within a year the airline was negotiating the sale of the five DC-8s. Northwest retired the last of its Boeing 377 Stratocruisers that September. The airline purchased several Boeing 720Bs in 1961, and 1963 several new Boeing 707-320Bs; for a time it adopted the slogan &quot;Northwest Orient: The Fan-Jet Airline&quot;. Nonstop transpacific flights became feasible with the introduction of the 707-320B/C. Northwest bought its first Boeing 747s in 1970 and soon began retiring its smaller 707s. In addition to operating the 747&#x27;s on transpacific flights, Northwest briefly flew them on its busiest domestic routes as well.

For years Northwest was the largest foreign airline serving Japan. In 1951, Northwest became involved with the founding of Japan Air Lines (JAL) by leasing airliners and crewmembers to the new airline. In 1952, United States and Japan ratified a regional bilateral aviation treaty, under which Northwest and Pan American World Airways became the two U.S. airlines in Tokyo. These carriers also received fifth freedom rights to carry passengers from and via Tokyo to other Asian destinations such as Seoul, Busan, Taipei, Kaohsiung, Manila, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Northwest also flew passenger routes from Japan to Guam and Saipan, U.S. possessions in Micronesia.

Northwest&#x27;s meteorologists, led by Dan Sowa, pioneered the first clear-air turbulence forecasting system in 1957, important since the airline flew many northern routes over turbulence-prone mountain areas. Northwest remained a leader in turbulence prediction, providing TPAWS (turbulence prediction and warning services) to other airlines.

===Transatlantic and domestic expansion===

During the regulated era, Northwest&#x27;s domestic network was mainly along the northern transcontinental route through Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle; New York and Detroit were added in 1945. Northwest also served Hawaii from the West Coast, and, starting in 1958–59, Georgia and Florida from Chicago. On June 1, 1959, Northwest accepted its first turboprop, the L-188 Electra, from the Lockheed Corporation. Northwest Airlines started flying the three-engine Boeing 727-100 in November 1964; many stretched B727-251s followed.

After airline deregulation in 1978 Northwest began nonstop flights to other Asian cities, returned to China in 1984 after a 34-year hiatus, and strengthened its presence in the southwestern United States. It also began flying to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. On May 21, 1984, shareholders in Northwest approved the creation of NWA Inc., a Delaware corporation that became the holding company of Northwest.

On October 1, 1986, Northwest merged with Republic Airlines, also based in Minneapolis-St. Paul. It was the largest airline merger at the time and caused operational issues which led the combined carrier to have an on-time performance of just 42 percent in its early days. Through the merger, NWA adopted Republic&#x27;s three-hub domestic network centered around Detroit, Memphis, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. The combined airline became particularly strong in the first two cities, with a market share of over 80% in each. After the merger, the airline dropped &quot;Orient&quot; from its branding. One major reason for the merger was that Northwest&#x27;s unique position as a domestic and transpacific carrier had been challenged in 1985 when United Airlines acquired the Pacific Division of Pan Am.

Northwest continued to use the pre-merger Northwest Orient livery (minus the word &quot;Orient&quot;) until a new livery and identity (designed by Landor Associates) were adopted in 1989. The new livery, nicknamed the &quot;bowling shoe&quot; by employees, featured colors of red, white, gray, and very dark blue.

Also in 1989, Northwest became the launch customer of the Boeing 747-400 and became one of only two airlines in the United States to operate it until its merger with Delta in 2009. The first aircraft it purchased was the first 747-400 to be built; it was later involved in a loss-of-control incident in 2002 and placed on display at the Delta Flight Museum following its retirement by Delta in 2015.

Northwest was purchased in a 1989 leveraged buyout by an investment group headed by Al Checchi, Fred Malek and Gary Wilson, with KLM, and many others. To pay off the debt incurred, the new management sold many of the airline&#x27;s aircraft to leasing companies, and sold property around the world, including land in central Tokyo. The expense of the buyout was so great that in 1993, following several years of losses due to industry overcapacity and a traffic downturn following the Gulf War, Northwest threatened bankruptcy to force three years of wage cuts upon its employee groups. Northwest subsequently made its first profit since 1989 on the backs of its workers.
Also in 1993, Northwest began its strategic alliance with KLM, which was the largest airline partnership at that time. This partnership eventually became the Wings Alliance, but the alliance never grew beyond the two airlines. Northwest gradually pulled out of its minor European destinations and focused on domestic and Asian markets.

On May 1, 1996, Northwest inaugurated the first-ever nonstop service from North America to China, Detroit–Beijing. Nonstop Detroit–Shanghai service followed in April 2000. These nonstop services were suspended in 2002 due to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Northwest then served these routes via Tokyo. The airline sought government approval to restore nonstop Detroit–Shanghai service in March 2007 but lost its bid to United&#x27;s Washington–Beijing route; however, before their merger with Delta Air Lines, Northwest received tentative authority to restart nonstop Detroit–Shanghai service starting March 25, 2009.

Through the late 1990s and early 2000s, Northwest enjoyed profits and focused on improving technology to increase convenience and reduce costs. The airline offered airport self-service check-in kiosks starting in 1997 and had more than any other airline. Northwest was the first large U.S. airline to offer internet check-in to passengers, with service from December 2000. During the early 2000s decade, Northwest acquired a reputation for refusing to adopt industry-wide fare increases that had been accepted by other airlines. This changed in March 2005, when Northwest adopted fare hikes in response to rising oil prices.

Due to competition from low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines and the impact of paying living wages in a new contract with employees represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) labor union, Northwest began to make cutbacks in early 2001 to preserve profits and executive salaries. Two small rounds of employee layoffs and other cutbacks were implemented in the months before the September 11 attacks. Following the attacks, Northwest was forced to make dramatic changes to its business structure through major employee layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. The retirement of costly and aging aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40 were accelerated as new aircraft went into service. In addition, the airline pursued options to reduce costs across the board, including removing pillows, peanuts, pretzels, in-flight entertainment on domestic flights, and newspapers and magazines. Over 50 McDonnell Douglas DC-9, Boeing 757, Boeing 747, and Airbus A320 family aircraft were withdrawn from use in an attempt to lower overall capacity and save money. Some of these aircraft were returned to service.

Following many years of a pioneering and close partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Northwest, along with partners KLM and Continental Airlines, joined SkyTeam, an alliance of ten airlines from around the world, on September 15, 2004. This was partially a result of Air France merging with KLM, forming the Air France-KLM group. Northwest continued to hemorrhage money, however.

===Bankruptcy===
Northwest filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the first time in its 79-year history on September 14, 2005, a day before a scheduled $65 million pension payment, and during a strike by its mechanics&#x27; union. With Northwest&#x27;s filing, four of the six largest U.S. carriers were operating under bankruptcy protection: Northwest joined Delta Air Lines (which filed just minutes before), United Airlines, and US Airways in bankruptcy. Northwest CEO Doug Steenland said that high fuel prices forced the airline to seek court protection; the relatively high age of Northwest&#x27;s fleet exacerbated the impact of fuel prices on its finances.

In the following weeks, Northwest Airlink carriers Mesaba Airlines and Pinnacle Airlines both announced that Northwest Airlines had missed payments to them for their Airlink flying. Northwest also announced plans to shrink its Airlink fleet by over 45 aircraft. Mesaba Aviation filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on October 13, 2005.

 Following its bankruptcy filing, Northwest renegotiated its labor contracts, lowering its highest level of flight attendant pay from $44,190 to $35,400. Northwest stock resumed trading on a &quot;when-issued&quot; basis on May 21, 2007, and regular trading began on May 31, 2007. On May 18, 2007, Northwest Airlines was cleared by a federal bankruptcy judge to emerge from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on May 31, 2007, ending Northwest&#x27;s 20 months of difficulty trying to slash costs.

On July 16, 2007, Northwest Airlines applied to the United States Department of Transportation for nonstop service between its WorldGateway hub in Detroit to Shanghai (beginning in 2007 on Boeing 747-400s) and to Beijing (beginning in 2010 on Boeing 787 Dreamliners). The airline faced off against Delta Air Lines (which proposed Atlanta to Shanghai and Beijing), American Airlines (Chicago/O&#x27;Hare–Beijing), Continental Airlines (Newark–Shanghai), US Airways (Philadelphia–Beijing), United Airlines (Los Angeles–Shanghai and San Francisco–Guangzhou), and MAXjet (Seattle–Shanghai) in the route competition.

On August 12, 2007, Northwest Airlines became a passive investor in the purchase of Midwest Airlines by TPG Capital. The airline stated that while it was an investor, it would not participate in any management or control of Midwest Airlines. However, on August 14, 2007, AirTran Airways raised their offer for Midwest to $16.25 a share, 25 cents more than the TPG offer. But soon after on August 17, 2007, TPG Capital raised their offer to $17.00 a share which sealed the deal. Northwest Airlines became a minority owner of Midwest Airlines in the fourth quarter of 2007.

On September 25, 2007, Northwest Airlines received DOT approval to begin service to Shanghai from its Detroit hub beginning March 25, 2009. American, Continental, Delta, and US Airways also received new or additional China route authority to Shanghai or Beijing, and United received authority to serve Guangzhou.

===Merger with Delta Air Lines===
On April 14, 2008, Northwest Airlines announced that it would be merging with Delta Air Lines to form the world&#x27;s largest airline. The merger was approved on October 29, 2008. The CEO during the merger of Delta and Northwest was Richard Anderson who was Northwest Airlines CEO from 2001 to 2004. The combined airline uses the Delta name and branding. On October 1, 2009, Northwest WorldPerks merged into SkyMiles. On January 31, 2010, Delta completed the merge of the reservation systems and discontinued using the Northwest name for flights. The official final flight was Northwest Airlines Flight 2470 from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

===NWA Cargo===
As of 2006, Northwest Airlines Cargo was the largest cargo carrier among U.S. combination passenger and cargo airlines. NWA Cargo&#x27;s fleet of dedicated freighter aircraft flew from some key cities in the United States and East Asia, as well as Amsterdam, connecting with the carrier&#x27;s cargo hub in Anchorage, Alaska (Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport), facilitating the quick transfer of cargo between large cities on both sides of the Pacific. NWA Cargo also transports freight aboard the passenger fleet of Northwest Airlines to more than 250 cities worldwide. Delta announced that the NWA Cargo hub will be shut down by the end of 2009. As of early 2008, NWA&#x27;s largest cargo client was DHL International. In December 2007, NWA announced that DHL International would terminate its cargo agreement with the airline effective late 2008. According to NWA Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis, the loss of its largest cargo client would bring significant changes to the division. Further changes to the NWA Cargo division continued into 2009 as it was merged into the Delta Cargo service. NWA Cargo ended all operations on December 28, 2009. On July 30, 2010, Northwest pleaded guilty to one count of felony price fixing for fixing prices for cargo shipping via NWA Cargo.

==Corporate affairs and identity==
===Headquarters===

Immediately before Northwest ceased being an independent airline, its headquarters was in Building A, a facility in Eagan, Minnesota, near Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the intersection of I-35E and Interstate 494. The building in the complex, which housed about 1,000 Northwest employees, was built in 1985. The building had a large &quot;N&quot; painted on the roof.

After Delta and Northwest merged, Delta moved the Eagan headquarters employees to other offices in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. In October 2009 Delta Air Lines hired a real estate broker to put the former Northwest Airlines headquarters complex for sale or lease. During that month the facility had a taxable value of $13.7 million. The airline marketed of the former NWA facility that is located along Interstate 494 separately from the main part of the property, as the airline considered the property to be excess. Terry Kingston, the executive director of the real estate brokerage firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield, stated that there had been some interest in the Northwest Airlines property from other parties. Northwest was the only occupant of the four-story headquarters building. Employees remaining in the Minneapolis area were moved to Building C, the former Republic Airlines headquarters building, located on the property of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, as well as Building J located in Eagan.

Before the headquarters were in Eagan, they were on the grounds of Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport.

===Labor relations===

A recurring issue in Northwest&#x27;s history was its troubled labor relations. In 1998, Northwest walked away from the bargaining table, locked out its pilots (represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International) and shut down the airline for more than two weeks. The airline sustained heavy losses as a result, and ended 1998 in the red, after being profitable since 1993.

On January 5, 2000, Northwest Airlines filed a federal lawsuit against the flight attendants&#x27; union and a number of employees. Along with its January 5 complaint, Northwest Airlines filed a motion for discovery, requesting searches of the hard drives of the office and home computers of union officials. Additionally, Northwest requested searches of the home computers of employees, including Kevin Griffin and Frank Reed. On February 8, Minnesota District Court Judge Boylan approved the request and issued the discovery order. The order required all 43 named defendants, officers and members to turn over both home and office computer equipment to the accounting company Ernst &amp; Young for &quot;purposes of examining and copying information and communications contained on the computer hard drives.&quot; The order permitted the discovery of all data, including e-mail communications. After conducting discovery, Northwest Airlines fired over a dozen employees in early March, stating that they had engaged in a sickout. The Union filed grievances claiming none of the employees&#x27; sick calls were false. The effect on intra-airline email use was marked: postings critical of Northwest Airlines by employees dwindled, and the majority of messages after the search were posted anonymously.
On August 20, 2005, after months of negotiations, an impasse declared by the NMB and a 30-day cooling off period, the over 4,750 Northwest aircraft mechanics, janitors, and aircraft cleaners represented by AMFA went on strike against the company. After numerous negotiation sessions, no agreement was reached, and the company began hiring permanent replacement workers. In mid-October, after permanently hiring about 500 non-union workers, Northwest made a final offer to the union. The offer would have saved 500 union jobs and offered four weeks of severance pay to terminated employees. This offer was worse than the original declined by the union, which would have saved over 2,000 jobs and offered 16 weeks of severance pay. On October 20, 2005, AMFA announced that it would not allow its members to vote on the offer, citing that parts of the contract would violate the union&#x27;s commitment to its members. Finally, in late December 2005, Northwest made what it termed its &quot;final offer&quot; to the union. The agreement would have terminated all striking workers and given them rights to unemployment compensation. The union voted down the offer. On October 9, 2006, AMFA leadership and Northwest reached an agreement. Under the settlement, all AMFA workers still on strike as of that date were converted to lay-off status with five weeks of severance pay (ten weeks if they resigned from Northwest). However, these employees had a right-of-recall to their old jobs. The settlement was approved on November 6, 2006.

On May 30, 2007, it was announced that the flight attendants narrowly agreed to concessions and became the last major workgroup at Northwest to agree to new contract terms. The deal was approved by a vote of 2,966 to 2,862. Union leaders said that 90.5 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. The new contract would provide Northwest with $1.9 billion in annual cuts through 2011.

Negotiations with attendants had been ongoing and contentious for several years. The flight attendants were unable to strike during negotiations because of a court injunction and the refusal of the mediation board to release them from bargaining which would have allowed the setting of a strike deadline. The attendants had been working under imposed pay cuts and work rules since July 2006 when a previous tentative agreement was rejected by 55 percent of the voting members.

Prior to the May 2007 agreement, union leaders had expressed concern that its defeat could prompt the National Mediation Board to recess talks indefinitely, resulting in the loss of a $182 million bankruptcy claim the attendants had against Northwest. With the new agreement, the $182 million claim was to eventually be sold for cash with an estimated pre-tax value of $15,000 to $18,000 per flight attendant.

Previous to the recent agreements, Northwest provided employees with stock in exchange for concessions. For example, in 1993 Northwest pilots, ground workers, and flight attendants received stock and seats on the board of directors in exchange for pay cuts. As part of the agreement, Northwest was to buy back these preferred shares in 2003 but refused to do so, citing financial distress. 

In the summer of 2007, Northwest was engaged in a labor conflict with its pilots over a large number of end of the month flight cancellations. The pilots claimed that Northwest did not have sufficient pilots to fly its schedule; Northwest accused the pilots of calling in sick to create the problem.

==Destinations==
Following the Republic merger in 1986, Northwest primarily operated on a hub and spoke route system with hubs in Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Tokyo. Under the KLM joint venture started in 1993, the two carriers established an Amsterdam hub where transatlantic routes operated by Northwest linked with European, African, and Asian routes operated by KLM. Northwest also operated a few routes outside this hub system, such as flights from the west coast to Honolulu.

In the mid-1980s, Northwest operated the only U.S. flag carrier service to Glasgow, Oslo, and Stockholm, as well as service to Copenhagen (the latter three cities are due to Minneapolis&#x27;s large Nordic population). However, this was later withdrawn after several years. From April 2000, Northwest operated non-stop flights from Detroit to Milan and Rome, both were later withdrawn (from 2003 to 2005 Rome was served only during the summer season). In 2009, under the banner of Delta, service to Rome was then resumed for the summer season.

In 1991, Northwest began service to Australia, after United and Qantas began non-stop flights to the continental U.S. using the newly introduced, long-range 747-400. Northwest routed its Sydney–New York flight through Osaka, which raised Japanese protest because less than 30% of passengers on the Australia–Japan segment were originating in the U.S.

On May 1, 1996, Northwest began the first-ever non-stop service from North America to mainland China, from Detroit to Beijing, three times a week. From 1996 until 2002, Northwest operated nonstop flights from its Detroit hub to Beijing and Shanghai. Eventually, these routes were suspended. When that happened, Northwest operated these routes from Detroit with a connection at its Tokyo–Narita hub. However, on July 16, 2007, Northwest re-applied with the US Department of Transportation for nonstop service between Detroit and both Beijing and Shanghai. On September 25, 2007, the US Department of Transportation tentatively awarded authority to Northwest for a new Detroit to Shanghai (Pudong) route effective March 25, 2009. The route was to be flown using the Boeing 747-400 until the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft became available, however, the Detroit–Shanghai nonstop route was taken over by Delta on October 24, 2009, using its Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 777-200LR aircraft after Delta ended nonstop service between Atlanta and Shanghai due to weak customer demand. The Detroit-Beijing nonstop route was later launched by the merged Delta using a Boeing 777-200ER on July 1, 2011.

In 2008, Northwest was one of several U.S. airlines to receive permission from the British government to fly into Heathrow Airport in London after previously having to use Gatwick Airport. Northwest began service to Heathrow from its hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis, as well as starting Seattle-London service. However, after being acquired by Delta in 2008, the Seattle route was dropped in January 2009 so the Heathrow landing slot and aircraft used could be redeployed to a more profitable route. In 2009, the Heathrow routes from the Detroit and Minneapolis hubs were taken over by Delta using its Boeing 767-400ER aircraft.

==Fleet==
At the time of the merger with Delta Air Lines, Northwest had a total of 320 aircraft with seven on order. It was also the last U.S. passenger airline to have a dedicated cargo fleet and cargo-only routes. The Northwest fleet was integrated into Delta&#x27;s fleet on December 31, 2009.

Northwest operated a mixed fleet of Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus aircraft whereas Delta operated just Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. The Boeing 757 was the only type common to the pre-merger fleets of both Delta and Northwest.

As part of a major fleet renewal program, Northwest introduced a simplified new paint scheme and logo in 2003. The airline replaced its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airliners with the Airbus A330. The first Airbus A330-300, used initially for European flights, arrived on August 6, 2003. Northwest Airlines also possessed the youngest trans-Atlantic fleet of any North American or European airline. Northwest Airlines also began flying reconfigured Boeing 757-200 airliners on some of its European flights carrying fewer passengers. Northwest was one of only two passenger airlines in the United States to fly the Boeing 747-400, the other being United Airlines. A number of Boeing 747-400 aircraft formerly operated by Northwest were then also flown by Delta following the merger of the two air carriers including the first B747-400 ever built with this aircraft currently on public display at the Delta Flight Museum located at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).

Northwest was looking for manufacturers to discuss the replacement of their 100, 110 and 125 seat McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (DC-9-10, DC-9-30 and DC-9-50) aircraft, with an average age of 35 years.

==Cabin==
In March 1988, Northwest Airlines announced that it would ban smoking on all flights within North America, effective April 23, 1988, on the same day that a rule from the U.S. federal government prohibiting smoking on all domestic flights of a duration of two hours or fewer, would take into effect. Northwest was the first major U.S. airline to enact a smoking ban since the Muse Air had ended its four-year smoking ban in 1985.

===World Business Class===
World Business Class was Northwest Airlines&#x27; international business class product. It was offered on all widebody aircraft. Seats had 60 inches of pitch and 176 degrees of recline. Passengers aboard this class received free meals and refreshments, including alcoholic beverages. All seats were equipped with Audio-Video-On-Demand (AVOD), universal power ports, a moveable reading light, a folding work table, and a swivel cocktail table.

===Domestic First Class===
 First Class was offered on all narrowbody aircraft, as well as CRJ-900 Northwest Airlink flights operated by Mesaba Airlines and E175 flights operated by Compass Airlines. Seats ranged from 19.5 to 21.5 inches wide, and had between 34 and 37 inches of pitch. Passengers aboard this class received complimentary meals, refreshments, and alcoholic beverages.

===International Economy Class===
Economy Class was offered on all widebody aircraft. Seats ranged from 17 to 17.5 inches wide, and had between 31 and 34 inches of pitch. Passengers aboard this class received free meals, snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages. Beer and wine were complimentary on international flights with complimentary meals, other alcoholic beverages could be purchased for a fee.

Passengers aboard Airbus A330 aircraft also had an Audio-Video-On-Demand (AVOD) system located in the seatback in front of them, and passengers seated in rows 10–23 (A330-200) or rows 10–28 (A330-300) had a universal power-port located below their seat.

===Domestic Economy Class===
Economy Class was offered on all narrowbody aircraft. Seats ranged from 17 to 17.5 inches wide and had between 30 and 34 inches of pitch, the same as on international economy class. Passengers aboard this class received free refreshments. In latter years in lieu of complimentary prepared meals, snack boxes, sandwiches (on select flights), and light snacks were available for purchase as part of a buy on board program. Alcoholic beverages were also sold.

Before 2008, Northwest Airlines was the only major U.S. airline (aside from low-cost, short-haul Southwest Airlines, Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines) to not offer any in-flight entertainment within North America (including Alaska). Although several of the airline&#x27;s domestic aircraft were originally equipped with in-flight entertainment systems, these were removed in 2005 to cut costs. US Airways implemented a similar initiative in 2008. On flights between Honolulu International Airport and Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, passengers experienced the same cabin as International Economy Class aboard Airbus A330 aircraft.

==WorldPerks==
Northwest Airlines&#x27; frequent-flyer program, &quot;WorldPerks&quot;, offered regular travelers the ability to obtain free tickets, First Class upgrades on flights, discounted membership for its airport lounges (WorldClubs), or other types of rewards. Customers could accumulate miles from actual flight segments flown or through Northwest&#x27;s partners, such as car rental companies, hotels, credit cards, and other vendors. WorldPerks&#x27; elite tiers were Silver Elite, Gold Elite, and Platinum Elite which allowed for more mileage bonuses, priority waitlists and standby, and other benefits. Over the years, some details of the program changed, such as introducing capacity-controlled awards (only a certain number of seats allocated for free travel), expiration of account after three years of inactivity, a requirement of a Saturday-night stay for domestic coach awards, waiving of capacity controls for awards but requiring double the number of miles for redemption, and adding several partner airlines for mileage accumulation and award redemption. The original name of the WorldPerks program was the Northwest Orient Airlines Free Flight Plan, which began in 1981. The original program used paper coupons and gave credit for flight segments. Upon renaming the program to &quot;WorldPerks&quot; in 1986, a mileage-based system was used.

In addition to its Northwest Airlink and SkyTeam alliance partnerships, Northwest offered frequent flyer partnerships with the following airlines:

Northwest also offered frequent flyer partnerships with the following car rental agencies:
==WorldClubs==

&quot;WorldClubs&quot; was Northwest&#x27;s member lounge. Members had reciprocal access to a number of other clubs, including fellow SkyTeam carriers such as KLM, Delta Air Lines and Air France. Northwest also had partnerships with various other airline lounges on an airport-by-airport basis. Unlike some other airline lounges, WorldClubs offered free alcoholic beverages in domestic locations and Tokyo-Narita. Northwest also offered free Wi-Fi internet access worldwide.

<text>Robert Edward Crane (July 13, 1928 – June 29, 1978) was an American actor, drummer, radio personality and disc jockey known for starring in the CBS sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

Crane was a drummer from age 11, and began his entertainment career as a radio personality, beginning in Hornell, New York and later in Connecticut. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he hosted the number-one rated morning radio show. In the early 1960s, Crane moved into acting, eventually landing the lead role of Colonel Robert Hogan in &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. The series aired from 1965 to 1971, and Crane received two Emmy Award nominations.

Crane&#x27;s career declined after &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. He became frustrated with the few roles that he was being offered and began performing in dinner theater. In 1975 he returned to television with the NBC series &quot;The Bob Crane Show&quot;, but the series received poor ratings and was cancelled after thirteen weeks. Afterward, Crane returned to performing in dinner theater and also appeared in occasional guest spots on television.

Crane was found bludgeoned to death in his Scottsdale, Arizona, apartment while on tour in June 1978 for a dinner theater production of &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Luck&quot;. In the 1990s his friend John Henry Carpenter was tried for the murder but was acquitted, and the case remains officially unsolved. Crane&#x27;s previously uncontroversial public image suffered due to the suspicious nature of his death and posthumous revelations about his personal life.

==Early life==
Bob Crane was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, the younger of two sons to Rose Mary (née Ksenich) and Alfred Thomas Crane—the original spelling of the family name was Crean. Crane spent his childhood and teenaged years in Stamford.

Crane began playing drums at the age of 11, and by junior high was organizing local drum and bugle parades with his neighborhood friends. He joined his high school&#x27;s orchestra and its marching and jazz bands. Crane also played for the Connecticut and Norwalk Symphony Orchestras as part of their youth orchestra program. He graduated from Stamford High School in 1946. Two years later, he enlisted for two years in the Connecticut Army National Guard and was honorably discharged in 1950. The previous year, he married his high-school sweetheart, Anne Terzian. The couple had three children: Robert David, Deborah Anne, and Karen Leslie.

==Career==
===Early career===

In 1950, Crane began his career in radio broadcasting at WLEA in Hornell, New York. He soon moved to Connecticut stations WLAD in Danbury, WBIS in Bristol and then WICC in Bridgeport, a 1,000-watt operation with a signal covering the northeastern portion of the New York metropolitan area. In 1956, Crane was hired by CBS Radio to host the morning show at its West Coast flagship KNX in Los Angeles, partly to re-energize that station&#x27;s ratings and partly to halt his erosion of suburban ratings at WCBS in New York City. In Los Angeles, Crane filled the broadcast with sly wit, drumming and such guests as Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope. His show quickly topped the morning ratings with adult listeners, and he became &quot;king of the Los Angeles airwaves.&quot;

Crane&#x27;s acting ambitions led to guest-hosting for Johnny Carson on the daytime game show &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; and appearances on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (uncredited), &quot;Channing&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. After Carl Reiner appeared on his radio show, Crane persuaded Reiner to book him for a guest appearance on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

===&quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; (1963–1964)===
After seeing Crane&#x27;s performance on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, Donna Reed offered him a guest shot on her program, ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. After the success of that episode, Crane&#x27;s character, Dr. David Kelsey, was incorporated into the show&#x27;s storyline, and Crane became a regular cast member, beginning with the episode &quot;Friends and Neighbors.&quot; Crane continued to work full-time at KNX during his stint on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, running back and forth from the KNX studio at Columbia Square to Columbia Studios. He left the show in December 1964.

===&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1965–1971)===
In 1965, Crane was offered the starring role in a CBS television sitcom set in a World War II POW camp. &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; involved the sabotage and espionage missions of Allied soldiers, led by Colonel Robert Hogan, from under the noses of the oblivious Germans guarding them. The show was an immediate ratings hit, finishing in the top ten in its first year. The series lasted for six seasons on CBS, and Crane was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1966 and 1967.

After having a love affair with &quot;Hogan&quot; co-star Cynthia Lynn, the actress who played Helga, Crane became romantically involved in 1968 with Lynn&#x27;s replacement Patricia Olson, who played Hilda under the stage name Sigrid Valdis. Crane divorced Terzian in 1970, just before their 21st anniversary, and married Olson on the set of the show later that year, with series co-star Richard Dawson serving as best man.
The couple&#x27;s son, Robert Scott &quot;Scotty&quot; Crane, was born in 1971, and they later adopted a daughter, Ana Marie. 

Crane&#x27;s son Robert David later alleged that Crane was not the biological father of any of Olson&#x27;s children. When they were married in 1970, Olson was already pregnant, but Crane had had a vasectomy in 1968 while he was still married to Terzian. Crane and Olson separated in 1977, and were mere weeks away from finalizing their divorce at the time of Crane&#x27;s death in June 1978.

===After &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;===
In 1968, Crane and &quot;Hogan&quot; co-stars Werner Klemperer, Leon Askin and John Banner appeared with Elke Sommer in a feature film, &quot;The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz&quot;, set in the divided city of Berlin during the Cold War. In 1969, Crane starred with Abby Dalton in a dinner theater production of &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; in 1971, Crane appeared in two Disney films: &quot;Superdad&quot; (1973), in the title role, and a small role in &quot;Gus&quot; (1976). In 1973, Crane purchased the rights to a comedy play called &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Luck&quot; and began touring it, as its star and director, at the Showboat Dinner Theatre in St. Petersburg, Florida; the La Mirada Civic Theatre in California; the Windmill Dinner Theatre in Scottsdale, Arizona; and other dinner theaters around the country.

Between theater engagements, Crane guest-starred in a number of television shows, including &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Gibbsville&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1975, he returned to television with his own series, &quot;The Bob Crane Show&quot; on NBC, which was cancelled after fourteen episodes. 

In early 1978, Crane taped a travel documentary in Hawaii and recorded an appearance on the Canadian afternoon cooking show &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot;; neither aired in the U.S. His appearance on &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot; was broadcast on CBC Television five times beginning in 1978, and was dramatized in the biopic film &quot;Auto Focus&quot;. Claims that Crane had been distraught during the taping and had made inappropriate jokes about death and sex have been denied by the show&#x27;s producers and production staff, who have stated that taping would have stopped or the episode cancelled if anything inappropriate had been said.

==Private life and murder==
Crane frequently videotaped and photographed his own sexual escapades. During the run of &quot;Hogan&quot;, Dawson introduced Crane to John Henry Carpenter, a regional sales manager for Sony Electronics who often helped famous clients with their video equipment. The two men struck up a friendship and began visiting bars and nightclubs together. Crane attracted many women due to his celebrity status, and he introduced Carpenter to them as his manager. The two men videotaped their joint sexual encounters. Crane&#x27;s son Scotty later insisted that all of the women were aware of the videotaping and consented to it, but several claimed that they had no idea that they had been recorded until they were informed by Scottsdale police after Crane&#x27;s murder. During their friendship, Carpenter became national sales manager at the consumer electronics company Akai and arranged his business trips to coincide with Crane&#x27;s touring schedule, allowing the two to continue videotaping their sexual encounters.


In June 1978, Crane was living in the Winfield Place Apartments in Scottsdale during a run of &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Luck&quot; at the Windmill Dinner Theatre. On the afternoon of June 29, his co-star Victoria Ann Berry entered his apartment after he failed to show up for a lunch meeting, and discovered his body. Crane had been bludgeoned to death with a weapon that was never identified, though investigators believed it to be a camera tripod. An electrical cord had been tied around his neck.

Crane&#x27;s funeral was held on July 5, 1978 at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Westwood, Los Angeles. An estimated 200 family members and friends attended, including John Astin, Astin&#x27;s wife Patty Duke and Carroll O&#x27;Connor. Pallbearers included &quot;Hogan&quot; producer Edward Feldman, co-stars Robert Clary and Larry Hovis, and Crane&#x27;s son Scotty. He was interred in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California. Olson later had his remains relocated to Westwood Village Memorial Park in Westwood, and she was buried beside him in 2007 under her stage name of Sigrid Valdis.

===Investigation===
Scottsdale police had no homicide division in 1978, so it was ill-equipped to handle such a high-profile murder investigation. The crime scene yielded few clues; no evidence was found of forced entry, and nothing of value was missing. Detectives examined Crane&#x27;s extensive videotape collection, which led them to Carpenter, who had flown to Phoenix on June 25 to spend a few days with Crane. Carpenter&#x27;s rental car was impounded and searched. Several blood smears were found that matched Crane&#x27;s blood type; no one else of that blood type was known to have been in the car, including Carpenter. DNA testing was not yet available, and the Maricopa County District Attorney declined to file charges.

In 1990, Scottsdale police investigator Barry Vassall and Maricopa County Attorney&#x27;s Office investigator Jim Raines re-examined the evidence from 1978 and persuaded the county attorney to reopen the case. DNA testing was inconclusive on the blood found in Carpenter&#x27;s rental car, but Raines did discover an evidence photograph of the car&#x27;s interior that appeared to show a piece of brain tissue. The actual tissue samples recovered from the car had been lost, but an Arizona judge ruled that the new evidence was admissible. In June 1992, Carpenter was arrested and charged with Crane&#x27;s murder.

===Trial===
At the 1994 trial, Crane&#x27;s son Scotty testified that Crane had repeatedly expressed a desire to terminate his friendship with Carpenter in the weeks before his death. He said that Carpenter had become &quot;a hanger-on&quot; and &quot;a nuisance to the point of being obnoxious.&quot; &quot;My dad expressed that he just didn&#x27;t need Carpenter kind of hanging around him anymore,&quot; he said. Scotty further testified that Crane had called Carpenter the night before the murder to end their friendship.

Carpenter&#x27;s attorneys attacked the prosecution&#x27;s case as circumstantial and inconclusive. They presented evidence that Carpenter and Crane were still on good terms, including witnesses from the restaurant where the two men had dined the evening before the murder. They noted that the murder weapon had never been identified or found; the prosecution&#x27;s camera tripod theory was sheer speculation, they said, based solely on Carpenter&#x27;s occupation. They disputed the claim that the newly discovered evidence photo showed brain tissue, and alleged that the police work had been sloppy, such as the mishandling and misplacing of evidence—including the crucial tissue sample itself. They pointed out that Crane had been videotaped and photographed in sexual relations with numerous women, implying that any one of them might have been the killer. Other potential suspects proposed by Carpenter&#x27;s attorneys included angry husbands and boyfriends of the women, and an actor who had sworn vengeance after a violent argument with Crane in Texas several months earlier.

Carpenter was acquitted, and he continued to maintain his innocence until his death in 1998. 

After the trial, Crane&#x27;s son Robert David speculated publicly that Patricia Olson might have had a role in instigating the crime. &quot;Nobody got a dime out of [the murder],&quot; he said, &quot;except for one person,&quot; alluding to Crane&#x27;s will, which left his entire estate to Olson while excluding him, his siblings and his mother. Robert David repeated his suspicions in the 2015 book &quot;Crane: Sex, Celebrity, and My Father&#x27;s Unsolved Murder&quot;. Maricopa County District Attorney Rick Romley responded, &quot;We never characterized Patty as a suspect,&quot; adding, &quot;I am convinced John Carpenter murdered Bob Crane.&quot; Officially, Crane&#x27;s murder remains unsolved.

===Later DNA testing===
In November 2016, the Maricopa County Attorney&#x27;s Office permitted Phoenix television reporter John Hook to submit the 1978 blood samples from Carpenter&#x27;s rental car for retesting, using a more advanced DNA technique than the one used in 1990. Two sequences were identified, one from an unknown male, and the other too degraded to reach a conclusion. 

This testing consumed all of the remaining DNA from the rental car, making further tests impossible. Hook&#x27;s investigation turned up two blood vials, samples from Crane and Carpenter, located in evidence storage at the Maricopa County Attorney&#x27;s Office. Carpenter voluntarily gave a sample to Scottsdale Police when he was questioned in 1978. Crane&#x27;s blood vial was recovered during his autopsy the day after the murder. Both were used as comparison samples for Hook&#x27;s DNA tests on the blood stains found in Carpenter&#x27;s rental car.

==&quot;Auto Focus&quot;==
Crane&#x27;s life and murder were the subject of the 2002 feature film &quot;Auto Focus&quot; directed by Paul Schrader and starring Greg Kinnear as Crane. The film is based on the book by &quot;The Murder of Bob Crane&quot; author Robert Graysmith and was described as &quot;brilliant&quot; by critic Roger Ebert. It portrays Crane as a happily married, church-going family man who succumbs to Hollywood&#x27;s celebrity lifestyle after becoming a television star. He meets Carpenter, played by Willem Dafoe, and learns about then-new home video technology. He subsequently descends into a life of strip clubs, BDSM and sex addiction.

Scotty challenged the film&#x27;s accuracy in an October 2002 review. &quot;During the last twelve years of his life,&quot; he wrote, &quot;[Crane] went to church three times: when I was baptized, when his father died, and when he was buried.&quot; Scotty further stated that Crane was a sex addict long before he became a celebrity, and that he may have begun recording his sexual encounters as early as 1956. There was no evidence, he said, that Crane engaged in BDSM; there were no such scenes in any of his hundreds of home movies, and Schrader admitted that the film&#x27;s BDSM scene was based on his own experience while writing his earlier film &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979). Before production on &quot;Auto Focus&quot; was announced, Scotty and Olson had tried to sell a rival script titled &quot;F-Stop&quot; or &quot;Take Off Your Clothes and Smile&quot;, but interest ceased after &quot;Auto Focus&quot; was announced.

In June 2001, Scotty launched the website, which remained active as late as May 2017. It included a paid section featuring photographs, outtakes from his father&#x27;s sex films and Crane&#x27;s autopsy report that proved, he said, that his father did not have a penile implant as stated in &quot;Auto Focus&quot;. Explicit photographs and videos from Crane&#x27;s private archive could also be purchased for a monthly subscription fee of $19.95. The site was renamed &quot;Bob Crane: The Official Web Site&quot;, but is now abandoned. An &quot;Official Licensing Website of Bob Crane&quot; was maintained by CMG Worldwide elsewhere on the internet—it was active as late as February 2023, but the website is now defunct.

<text>Stress, whether physiological, biological or psychological, is an organism&#x27;s response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. When stressed by stimuli that alter an organism&#x27;s environment, multiple systems respond across the body. In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. Two well-known hormones that humans produce during stressful situations are adrenaline and cortisol. 

The sympathoadrenal medullary (SAM) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis. 

The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol, which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions. The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and stria terminalis. Through these mechanisms, stress can alter memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism and susceptibility to diseases. 

Disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses, whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses.

==Psychology==
Acute stressful situations where the stress experienced is severe is a cause of change psychologically to the detriment of the well-being of the individual, such that symptomatic derealization and depersonalization, and anxiety and hyperarousal, are experienced. The International Classification of Diseases includes a group of mental and behavioral disorders which have their aetiology in reaction to severe stress and the consequent adaptive response. Chronic stress, and a lack of coping resources available, or used by an individual, can often lead to the development of psychological issues such as delusions, depression and anxiety (see below for further information).

Chronic stressors may not be as intense as acute stressors such as natural disaster or a major accident, but persist over longer periods of time and tend to have a more negative effect on health because they are sustained and thus require the body&#x27;s physiological response to occur daily. This depletes the body&#x27;s energy more quickly and usually occurs over long periods of time, especially when these microstressors cannot be avoided (i.e. stress of living in a dangerous neighborhood). See allostatic load for further discussion of the biological process by which chronic stress may affect the body. For example, studies have found that caregivers, particularly those of dementia patients, have higher levels of depression and slightly worse physical health than non-caregivers.

When humans are under chronic stress, permanent changes in their physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses may occur. Chronic stress can include events such as caring for a spouse with dementia, or may result from brief focal events that have long term effects, such as experiencing a sexual assault. Studies have also shown that psychological stress may directly contribute to the disproportionately high rates of coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and its etiologic risk factors. Specifically, acute and chronic stress have been shown to raise serum lipids and are associated with clinical coronary events.

However, it is possible for individuals to exhibit hardiness—a term referring to the ability to be both chronically stressed and healthy. Even though psychological stress is often connected with illness or disease, most healthy individuals can still remain disease-free after being confronted with chronic stressful events. This suggests that there are individual differences in vulnerability to the potential pathogenic effects of stress; individual differences in vulnerability arise due to both genetic and psychological factors. In addition, the age at which the stress is experienced can dictate its effect on health. Research suggests chronic stress at a young age can have lifelong effects on the biological, psychological, and behavioral responses to stress later in life.

==Etymology and historical usage==
The term &quot;stress&quot; had none of its contemporary connotations before the 1920s. It is a form of the Middle English &quot;destresse&quot;, derived via Old French from the Latin &quot;stringere&quot;, &quot;to draw tight&quot;. The word had long been in use in physics to refer to the internal distribution of a force exerted on a material body, resulting in strain. In the 1920s and &#x27;30s, biological and psychological circles occasionally used &quot;stress&quot; to refer to a physiological or environmental perturbation that could cause physiological and mental &quot;strain&quot;. The amount of strain in reaction to stress depends on the resilience. Excessive strain would appear as illness.

Walter Cannon used it in 1926 to refer to external factors that disrupted what he called homeostasis. But &quot;...stress as an explanation of lived experience is absent from both lay and expert life narratives before the 1930s&quot;. Physiological stress represents a wide range of physical responses that occur as a direct effect of a stressor causing an upset in the homeostasis of the body. Upon immediate disruption of either psychological or physical equilibrium the body responds by stimulating the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. The reaction of these systems causes a number of physical changes that have both short- and long-term effects on the body.

The Holmes and Rahe stress scale was developed as a method of assessing the risk of disease from life changes. The scale lists both positive and negative changes that elicit stress. These include things such as a major holiday or marriage, or death of a spouse and firing from a job.

==Biological need for equilibrium==
Homeostasis is a concept central to the idea of stress. In biology, most biochemical processes strive to maintain equilibrium (homeostasis), a steady state that exists more as an ideal and less as an achievable condition. Environmental factors, internal or external stimuli, continually disrupt homeostasis; an organism&#x27;s present condition is a state of constant flux moving about a homeostatic point that is that organism&#x27;s optimal condition for living. Factors causing an organism&#x27;s condition to diverge too far from homeostasis can be experienced as stress. A life-threatening situation such as a major physical trauma or prolonged starvation can greatly disrupt homeostasis. On the other hand, an organism&#x27;s attempt at restoring conditions back to or near homeostasis, often consuming energy and natural resources, can also be interpreted as stress.

The ambiguity in defining this phenomenon was first recognized by Hans Selye (1907–1982) in 1926. In 1951 a commentator loosely summarized Selye&#x27;s view of stress as something that &quot;...in addition to being itself, was also the cause of itself, and the result of itself&quot;.

First to use the term in a biological context, Selye continued to define stress as &quot;the non-specific response of the body to any demand placed upon it&quot;. Neuroscientists such as Bruce McEwen and Jaap Koolhaas believe that stress, based on years of empirical research, &quot;should be restricted to conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism&quot;. Indeed, in 1995 Toates already defined stress as a &quot;chronic state that arises only when defense mechanisms are either being chronically stretched or are actually failing,&quot; while according to Ursin (1988) stress results from an inconsistency between expected events (&quot;set value&quot;) and perceived events (&quot;actual value&quot;) that cannot be resolved satisfactorily, which also puts stress into the broader context of cognitive-consistency theory.

==Biological background==
Stress can have many profound effects on the human biological systems. Biology primarily attempts to explain major concepts of stress using a stimulus-response paradigm, broadly comparable to how a psychobiological sensory system operates. The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) plays a crucial role in the body&#x27;s stress-related mechanisms. Whether one should interpret these mechanisms as the body&#x27;s response to a stressor or embody the act of stress itself is part of the ambiguity in defining what exactly stress is.

The central nervous system works closely with the body&#x27;s endocrine system to regulate these mechanisms. The sympathetic nervous system becomes primarily active during a stress response, regulating many of the body&#x27;s physiological functions in ways that ought to make an organism more adaptive to its environment. Below there follows a brief biological background of neuroanatomy and neurochemistry and how they relate to stress.

Stress, either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress may induce abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: serotonin systems, catecholamine systems, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Aggressive behavior has also been associated with abnormalities in these systems.

==Biology of stress==
The brain endocrine interactions are relevant in the translation of stress into physiological and psychological changes. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), as mentioned above, plays an important role in translating stress into a response. The ANS responds reflexively to both physical stressors (for example baroreception), and to higher level inputs from the brain.

The ANS is composed of the parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system, two branches that are both tonically active with opposing activities. The ANS directly innervates tissue through the postganglionic nerves, which is controlled by preganglionic neurons originating in the intermediolateral cell column. The ANS receives inputs from the medulla, hypothalamus, limbic system, prefrontal cortex, midbrain and monoamine nuclei.

The activity of the sympathetic nervous system drives what is called the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. The fight or flight response to emergency or stress involves mydriasis, increased heart rate and force contraction, vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, sweating, decreased motility of the digestive system, secretion of the epinephrine and cortisol from the adrenal medulla, and relaxation of the bladder wall. The parasympathetic nervous response, &quot;rest and digest&quot;, involves return to maintaining homeostasis, and involves miosis, bronchoconstriction, increased activity of the digestive system, and contraction of the bladder walls. Complex relationships between protective and vulnerability factors on the effect of childhood home stress on psychological illness, cardiovascular illness and adaption have been observed. ANS related mechanisms are thought to contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease after major stressful events.

The HPA axis is a neuroendocrine system that mediates a stress response. Neurons in the hypothalamus, particularly the paraventricular nucleus, release vasopressin and corticotropin releasing hormone, which travel through the hypophysial portal vessel where they travel to and bind to the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor on the anterior pituitary gland. Multiple CRH peptides have been identified, and receptors have been identified on multiple areas of the brain, including the amygdala. CRH is the main regulatory molecule of the release of ACTH.

The secretion of ACTH into systemic circulation allows it to bind to and activate Melanocortin receptor, where it stimulates the release of steroid hormones. Steroid hormones bind to glucocorticoid receptors in the brain, providing negative feedback by reducing ACTH release. Some evidence supports a second long term feedback that is non-sensitive to cortisol secretion. The PVN of the hypothalamus receives inputs from the nucleus of the solitary tract, and lamina terminalis. Through these inputs, it receives and can respond to changes in blood.

The PVN innervation from the brain stem nuclei, particularly the noradrenergic nuclei stimulate CRH release. Other regions of the hypothalamus both directly and indirectly inhibit HPA axis activity. Hypothalamic neurons involved in regulating energy balance also influence HPA axis activity through the release of neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y, which stimulates HPA axis activity. Generally, the amygdala stimulates, and the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus attenuate, HPA axis activity; however, complex relationships do exist between the regions.

The immune system may be heavily influenced by stress. The sympathetic nervous system innervates various immunological structures, such as bone marrow and the spleen, allowing for it to regulate immune function. The adrenergic substances released by the sympathetic nervous system can also bind to and influence various immunological cells, further providing a connection between the systems. The HPA axis ultimately results in the release of cortisol, which generally has immunosuppressive effects. However, the effect of stress on the immune system is disputed, and various models have been proposed in an attempt to account for both the supposedly &quot;immunodeficiency&quot; linked diseases and diseases involving hyper activation of the immune system. One model proposed to account for this suggests a push towards an imbalance of cellular immunity(Th1) and humoral immunity(Th2). The proposed imbalance involved hyperactivity of the Th2 system leading to some forms of immune hypersensitivity, while also increasing risk of some illnesses associated with decreased immune system function, such as infection and cancer.

==Effects of chronic stress==
Chronic stress is a term sometimes used to differentiate it from acute stress. Definitions differ, and may be along the lines of continual activation of the stress response, stress that causes an allostatic shift in bodily functions, or just as &quot;prolonged stress&quot;. While responses to acute stressors typically do not impose a health burden on young, healthy individuals, chronic stress in older or unhealthy individuals may have long-term effects that are detrimental to health.

===Infectious===
Some studies have observed increased risk of upper respiratory tract infection during chronic life stress. In patients with HIV, increased life stress and cortisol was associated with poorer progression of HIV. Also with an increased level of stress, studies have proven evidence that it can reactivate latent herpes viruses.

===Chronic disease===
A link has been suggested between chronic stress and cardiovascular disease. Stress appears to play a role in hypertension, and may further predispose people to other conditions associated with hypertension. Stress may precipitate abuse of drugs and/or alcohol. Stress may also contribute to aging and chronic diseases in aging, such as depression and metabolic disorders.

===Development===
Chronic stress has also been shown to impair developmental growth in children by lowering the pituitary gland&#x27;s production of growth hormone, as in children associated with a home environment involving serious marital discord, alcoholism, or child abuse. More generally, prenatal life, infancy, childhood, and adolescence are critical periods in which the vulnerability to stressors is particularly high.

===Psychopathology===
Chronic stress is seen to affect the parts of the brain where memories are processed through and stored. When people feel stressed, stress hormones get over-secreted, which affects the brain. This secretion is made up of glucocorticoids, including cortisol, which are steroid hormones that the adrenal gland releases, although this can increase storage of flashbulb memories it decreases long-term potentiation (LTP). The hippocampus is important in the brain for storing certain kinds of memories and damage to the hippocampus can cause trouble in storing new memories but old memories, memories stored before the damage, are not lost. Also high cortisol levels can be tied to the deterioration of the hippocampus and decline of memory that many older adults start to experience with age. These mechanisms and processes may therefore contribute to age-related disease, or originate risk for earlier-onset disorders. For instance, extreme stress (e.g. trauma) is a requisite factor to produce stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. A 2024 review by Cochrane reported that the global estimated lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults is approximately 3.9%. 

Chronic stress also shifts learning, forming a preference for habit based learning, and decreased task flexibility and spatial working memory, probably through alterations of the dopaminergic systems. Stress may also increase reward associated with food, leading to weight gain and further changes in eating habits. Stress may contribute to various disorders, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, as well as functional somatic syndromes.

==Psychological concepts==
===Eustress===
Selye published in year 1975 a model dividing stress into eustress and distress. Where stress enhances function (physical or mental, such as through strength training or challenging work), it may be considered eustress. Persistent stress that is not resolved through coping or adaptation, deemed distress, may lead to anxiety or withdrawal (depression) behavior.

The difference between experiences that result in &quot;eustress&quot; and those that result in &quot;distress&quot; is determined by the disparity between an experience (real or imagined) and personal expectations, and resources to cope with the stress. Alarming experiences, either real or imagined, can trigger a stress response.

===Coping===
Responses to stress include adaptation, psychological coping such as stress management, anxiety, and depression. Over the long term, distress can lead to diminished health and/or increased propensity to illness; to avoid this, stress must be managed.

Stress management encompasses techniques intended to equip a person with effective coping mechanisms for dealing with psychological stress, with stress defined as a person&#x27;s physiological response to an internal or external stimulus that triggers the fight-or-flight response. Stress management is effective when a person uses strategies to cope with or alter stressful situations.

There are several ways of coping with stress, such as controlling the source of stress or learning to set limits and to say &quot;no&quot; to some of the demands that bosses or family members may make.

A person&#x27;s capacity to tolerate the source of stress may be increased by thinking about another topic such as a hobby, listening to music, or spending time in a wilderness.

A way to control stress is first dealing with what is causing the stress if it is something the individual has control over. Other methods to control stress and reduce it can be: to not procrastinate and leave tasks for the last minute, do things you like, exercise, do breathing routines, go out with friends, and take a break. Having support from a loved one also helps a lot in reducing stress.

One study showed that the power of having support from a loved one, or just having social support, lowered stress in individual subjects. Painful shocks were applied to married women&#x27;s ankles. In some trials women were able to hold their husband&#x27;s hand, in other trials they held a stranger&#x27;s hand, and then held no one&#x27;s hand. When the women were holding their husband&#x27;s hand, the response was reduced in many brain areas. When holding the stranger&#x27;s hand the response was reduced a little, but not as much as when they were holding their husband&#x27;s hand. Social support helps reduce stress and even more so if the support is from a loved one.

===Cognitive appraisal===
Lazarus argued that, in order for a psychosocial situation to be stressful, it must be appraised as such. He argued that cognitive processes of appraisal are central in determining whether a situation is potentially threatening, constitutes a harm/loss or a challenge, or is benign.

Both personal and environmental factors influence this primary appraisal, which then triggers the selection of coping processes. Problem-focused coping is directed at managing the problem, whereas emotion-focused coping processes are directed at managing the negative emotions. Secondary appraisal refers to the evaluation of the resources available to cope with the problem, and may alter the primary appraisal.

In other words, primary appraisal includes the perception of how stressful the problem is and the secondary appraisal of estimating whether one has more than or less than adequate resources to deal with the problem that affects the overall appraisal of stressfulness. Further, coping is flexible in that, in general, the individual examines the effectiveness of the coping on the situation; if it is not having the desired effect, they will, in general, try different strategies.

==Assessment==
===Health risk factors===
Both negative and positive stressors can lead to stress. The intensity and duration of stress changes depending on the circumstances and emotional condition of the person with it (Arnold. E and Boggs. K. 2007). Some common categories and examples of stressors include:
* Sensory input such as pain, bright light, noise, temperatures, or environmental issues such as a lack of control over environmental circumstances, such as food, air and/or water quality, housing, health, freedom, or mobility.
* Social issues can also cause stress, such as struggles with conspecific or difficult individuals and social defeat, or relationship conflict, deception, or break ups, and major events such as birth and deaths, marriage, and divorce.
* Life experiences such as poverty, unemployment, clinical depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, heavy drinking, or insufficient sleep can also cause stress. Students and workers may face performance pressure stress from exams and project deadlines.
* Adverse experiences during development (e.g. prenatal exposure to maternal stress, poor attachment histories, sexual abuse) are thought to contribute to deficits in the maturity of an individual&#x27;s stress response systems. One evaluation of the different stresses in people&#x27;s lives is the Holmes and Rahe stress scale.

===General adaptation syndrome===

Physiologists define stress as how the body reacts to a stressor - a stimulus, real or imagined. Acute stressors affect an organism in the short term; chronic stressors over the longer term. The general adaptation syndrome (GAS), developed by Hans Selye, is a profile of how organisms respond to stress; GAS is characterized by three phases: a nonspecific alarm mobilization phase, which promotes sympathetic nervous system activity; a resistance phase, during which the organism makes efforts to cope with the threat; and an exhaustion phase, which occurs if the organism fails to overcome the threat and depletes its physiological resources.

====Stage 1====
&quot;Alarm&quot; is the first stage, which is divided into two phases: the &quot;shock&quot; phase and the &quot;antishock&quot; phase.
* &quot;Shock phase&quot;: During this phase, the body can endure changes such as hypovolemia, hypoosmolarity, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoglycemia—the stressor effect. This phase resembles Addison&#x27;s disease. The organism&#x27;s resistance to the stressor drops temporarily below the normal range and some level of shock (e.g. circulatory shock) may be experienced.
* &quot;Antishock phase&quot;: When the threat or stressor is identified or realized, the body starts to respond and is in a state of alarm. During this stage, the locus coeruleus and sympathetic nervous system activate the production of catecholamines including adrenaline, engaging the popularly-known fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline temporarily provides increased muscular tonus, increased blood pressure due to peripheral vasoconstriction and tachycardia, and increased glucose in blood. There is also some activation of the HPA axis, producing glucocorticoids (cortisol, aka the S-hormone or stress-hormone).

====Stage 2====
&quot;Resistance&quot; is the second stage. During this stage, increased secretion of glucocorticoids intensifies the body&#x27;s systemic response. Glucocorticoids can increase the concentration of glucose, fat, and amino acid in blood. In high doses, one glucocorticoid, cortisol, begins to act similarly to a mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) and brings the body to a state similar to hyperaldosteronism. If the stressor persists, it becomes necessary to attempt some means of coping with the stress. The body attempts to respond to stressful stimuli, but after prolonged activation, the body&#x27;s chemical resources will be gradually depleted, leading to the final stage.

====Stage 3====
The third stage could be either &quot;exhaustion&quot; or &quot;recovery&quot;:
* Recovery stage follows when the system&#x27;s compensation mechanisms have successfully overcome the stressor effect (or have completely eliminated the factor which caused the stress). The high glucose, fat and amino acid levels in blood prove useful for anabolic reactions, restoration of homeostasis and regeneration of cells.
* &quot;Exhaustion&quot; is the alternative third stage in the GAS model. At this point, all of the body&#x27;s resources are eventually depleted and the body is unable to maintain normal function. The initial autonomic nervous system symptoms may reappear (panic attacks, muscle aches, sore eyes, difficulty breathing, fatigue, heartburn, high blood pressure, and difficulty sleeping, etc.). If stage three is extended, long-term damage may result (prolonged vasoconstriction results in ischemia which in turn leads to cell necrosis), as the body&#x27;s immune system becomes exhausted, and bodily functions become impaired, resulting in decompensation.

The result can manifest itself in obvious illnesses, such as general trouble with the digestive system (e.g. occult bleeding, melena, constipation/obstipation), diabetes, or even cardiovascular problems (angina pectoris), along with clinical depression and other mental illnesses.

==History in research==
The current usage of the word &quot;stress&quot; arose out of Hans Selye&#x27;s 1930s experiments. He started to use the term to refer not just to the agent but to the state of the organism as it responded and adapted to the environment. His theories of a universal non-specific stress response attracted great interest and contention in academic physiology and he undertook extensive research programs and publication efforts.

While the work attracted continued support from advocates of psychosomatic medicine, many in experimental physiology concluded that his concepts were too vague and unmeasurable. During the 1950s, Selye turned away from the laboratory to promote his concept through popular books and lecture tours. He wrote for both non-academic physicians and, in an international bestseller entitled &quot;Stress of Life&quot;, for the general public.

A broad biopsychosocial concept of stress and adaptation offered the promise of helping everyone achieve health and happiness by successfully responding to changing global challenges and the problems of modern civilization. Selye coined the term &quot;eustress&quot; for positive stress, by contrast to distress. He argued that all people have a natural urge and need to work for their own benefit, a message that found favor with industrialists and governments. He also coined the term &quot;stressor&quot; to refer to the causative event or stimulus, as opposed to the resulting state of stress.

Selye was in contact with the tobacco industry from 1958 and they were undeclared allies in litigation and the promotion of the concept of stress, clouding the link between smoking and cancer, and portraying smoking as a &quot;diversion&quot;, or in Selye&#x27;s concept a &quot;deviation&quot;, from environmental stress.

From the late 1960s, academic psychologists started to adopt Selye&#x27;s concept; they sought to quantify &quot;life stress&quot; by scoring &quot;significant life events&quot;, and a large amount of research was undertaken to examine links between stress and disease of all kinds. By the late 1970s, stress had become the medical area of greatest concern to the general population, and more basic research was called for to better address the issue. There was also renewed laboratory research into the neuroendocrine, molecular, and immunological bases of stress, conceived as a useful heuristic not necessarily tied to Selye&#x27;s original hypotheses. The US military became a key center of stress research, attempting to understand and reduce combat neurosis and psychiatric casualties.

The psychiatric diagnosis &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; (&quot;PTSD&quot;) was coined in the mid-1970s, in part through the efforts of anti-Vietnam War activists and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and Chaim F. Shatan. The condition was added to the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; as &quot;posttraumatic stress disorder&quot; in 1980. PTSD was considered a severe and ongoing emotional reaction to an extreme psychological trauma, and as such often associated with soldiers, police officers, and other emergency personnel. The stressor may involve threat to life (or viewing the actual death of someone else), serious physical injury, or threat to physical or psychological integrity. In some cases, it can also be from profound psychological and emotional trauma, apart from any actual physical harm or threat. Often, however, the two are combined.

By the 1990s, &quot;stress&quot; had become an integral part of modern scientific understanding in all areas of physiology and human functioning, and one of the great metaphors of Western life. Focus grew on stress in certain settings, such as workplace stress, and stress management techniques were developed. The term also became a euphemism, a way of referring to problems and eliciting sympathy without being explicitly confessional, just &quot;stressed out&quot;. It came to cover a huge range of phenomena from mild irritation to the kind of severe problems that might result in a real breakdown of health. In popular usage, almost any event or situation between these extremes could be described as stressful.

The American Psychological Association&#x27;s 2015 Stress In America Study found that nationwide stress is on the rise and that the three leading sources of stress were &quot;money&quot;, &quot;family responsibility&quot;, and &quot;work&quot;.

<text>Self-help or self-improvement is &quot;a focus on self-guided, in contrast to professionally guided, efforts to cope with life problems&quot; —economically, physically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis.

When engaged in self-help, people often use publicly available information, or support groups—on the Internet as well as in person—in which people in similar situations work together. From early examples in &quot;pro se&quot; legal practice and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to education, business, exercise, psychology, and psychotherapy, as commonly distributed through the popular genre of self-help books. According to the &quot;APA Dictionary of Psychology&quot;, potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, identity, meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.

Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents, and in some cases leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become integrated into mainstream language.

Self-help groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and caregivers. As well as featuring long-time members sharing experiences, these health groups can become support groups and clearinghouses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer or mutual-support groups.

==History==
In classical antiquity, Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; &quot;opens with moral remonstrances, hammered home in every way that Hesiod can think of.&quot;

The Stoics offered ethical advice &quot;on the notion of —of well-being, welfare, flourishing.&quot; The &quot;Discourses&quot; of Epictetus can be read as a sort of early self-help advice column, and the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius as the journal of someone engaged on a deliberate self-help program.

The genre of mirror-of-princes writing, which has a long history in Greco-Roman and Western Renaissance literature, represents a secular cognate of Biblical wisdom literature. Proverbs from many periods, collected and uncollected, embody traditional moral and practical advice of diverse cultures.

The hyphenated compound word &quot;self-help&quot; often appeared in the 1800s in a legal context, referring to the doctrine that a party in a dispute has the right to use lawful means on their initiative to remedy a wrong.

Some consider the self-help movement to have been inaugurated by George Combe&#x27;s &quot;Constitution&quot; (1828), from the way that it advocated personal responsibility and the possibility of naturally sanctioned self-improvement through education or proper self-control. In 1841, an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson, entitled Compensation, was published suggesting &quot;every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults&quot; and &quot;acquire habits of &quot;self-help&quot;&quot; as &quot;our strength grows out of our weakness.&quot; Samuel Smiles (1812–1904) published the first explicitly &quot;self-help&quot; book, titled &quot;Self-Help&quot;, in 1859. Its opening sentence: &quot;Heaven helps those who help themselves&quot;, provides a variation of &quot;God helps them that help themselves&quot;, the oft-quoted maxim that had also appeared previously in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; (1733–1758).

===Early 20th century===

In 1902, James Allen published &quot;As a Man Thinketh&quot;, which proceeds from the conviction that &quot;a man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.&quot; Noble thoughts, the book maintains, make for a noble person, while lowly thoughts make for a miserable person. Napoleon Hill&#x27;s &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; (1937) described the use of repeated positive thoughts to attract happiness and wealth by tapping into an &quot;Infinite Intelligence&quot;.

In 1936, Dale Carnegie further developed the genre with &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;. Having failed in several careers, Carnegie became fascinated with success and its link to self-confidence, and his books have since sold over 50 million copies.

==The market==

Group and corporate attempts to help people help themselves have created a self-help marketplace, with Large Group Awareness Trainings (LGATs) and psychotherapy systems represented. These offer more-or-less prepackaged solutions to instruct people seeking their betterment, just as &quot;the literature of self-improvement directs the reader to familiar frameworks... what the French social theorist Gabriel Tarde called &#x27;the grooves of borrowed thought&#x27;.&quot;

A subgenre of self-help book series exists, such as the &quot; for Dummies&quot; guides and &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide to...&quot;, that are varieties of how-to books.

=== Statistics ===
At the start of the 21st century, &quot;the self-improvement industry, inclusive of books, seminars, audio and video products, and personal coaching, [was] said to constitute a 2.48-billion dollars-a-year industry&quot; in the United States alone. By 2006, research firm Marketdata estimated the &quot;self-improvement&quot; market in the U.S. as worth more than —including infomercials, mail-order catalogs, holistic institutes, books, audio cassettes, motivation-speaker seminars, the personal coaching market, and weight-loss and stress-management programs. Market data projected that the total market size would grow to over by 2008. In 2013 Kathryn Schulz examined &quot;an $11 billion industry&quot;.

===Self-help and professional service delivery===
Self-help and mutual-help are very different from—though they may complement—aid by professionals.

Conflicts can and do arise on that interface, however, with some professionals considering that, for example, &quot;the twelve-step approach encourages a kind of contemporary version of 19th-century amateurism or enthusiasm in which self-examination and very general social observations are enough to draw rather large conclusions.&quot;

==Research==
The rise of self-help culture led to boundary disputes with other approaches and disciplines. Some would object to their classification as &quot;self-help&quot; literature, as with &quot;Deborah Tannen&#x27;s denial of the self-help role of her books&quot; to maintain her academic credibility, aware of the danger that &quot;writing a book that becomes a popular success...all but ensures that one&#x27;s work will lose its long-term legitimacy.&quot;

Placebo effects can never be wholly discounted. Careful studies of &quot;the power of subliminal self-help tapes... showed that their content had no real effect... But that&#x27;s not what the participants thought.&quot; &quot;If they thought they&#x27;d listened to a self-esteem tape (even though half the labels were wrong), they felt that their self-esteem had gone up. No wonder people keep buying subliminal tapes: even though the tapes don&#x27;t work, people think they do.&quot;

Much of the self-help industry may be thought of as part of the &quot;skin trades. People need haircuts, massage, dentistry, wigs and glasses, sociology and surgery, love and advice.&quot;—a skin trade, &quot;not a profession and a science&quot;. Its practitioners thus function as &quot;part of the personal service industry rather than as mental health professionals.&quot; While &quot;there is no proof that twelve-step programs &#x27;are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems&#x27;,&quot; at the same time it is clear that &quot;there is something about &#x27;groupishness&#x27; itself which is curative.&quot; Thus for example &quot;smoking increases mortality risk by a factor of just 1.6, while social isolation does so by a factor of 2.0... suggest[ing] an added value to self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous as surrogate communities.&quot;

Some psychologists advocate for positive psychology, and explicitly embrace an empirical self-help philosophy. &quot;[T]he role of positive psychology is to become a bridge between the ivory tower and the main street—between the rigor of academe and the fun of the self-help movement.&quot; They aim to refine the self-improvement field by intentionally increasing scientifically sound research and well-engineered models. The division of focus and methodologies has produced several sub-fields, in particular: general positive psychology, focusing primarily on studying psychological phenomenon and effects; and personal effectiveness, focusing primarily on analysis, design, and implementation of qualitative personal growth. The latter of these includes intentionally training new patterns of thought and feeling. As business strategy communicator Don Tapscott puts it, &quot;Why not courses that emphasize designing a great brain?... The design industry is something done to us. I&#x27;m proposing we each become designers. But I suppose &#x27;I love the way she thinks&#x27; could take on new meaning.&quot;

Both self-talk—the propensity to engage in verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought—and social support can be used as instruments of self-improvement, often via empowering action-promoting messages. Psychologists designed experiments to shed light on how self-talk can result in self-improvement. Research has shown that people prefer second-person pronouns over first-person pronouns when engaging in self-talk to achieve goals, regulate their behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance.

Self-talk also plays an important role in regulating emotions under social stress. People who use non-first-person language tend to exhibit a higher level of visual distance during the process of introspection, indicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one&#x27;s own name may result in enhanced self-distancing. This form of self-help can enhance people&#x27;s ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in more challenging and less threatening terms.

==Criticism==
Scholars have targeted many self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005, Steve Salerno portrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym &quot;SHAM: the Self-Help and Actualization Movement&quot;—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful. &quot;Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or not.&quot; Another critic pointed out that with self-help books &quot;supply increases the demand… The more people read them, the more they think they need them… more like an addiction than an alliance.&quot;

Self-help writers have been described as working &quot;in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the narrativized… although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of moralizing.&quot;

Christopher Buckley in his book &quot;God Is My Broker&quot; asserts: &quot;The only way to get rich from a self-help book is to write one&quot;.

Gerald Rosen raised concerns that psychologists were promoting untested self-help books with exaggerated claims rather than conducting studies that could advance the effectiveness of these programs to help the public. Rosen noted the potential benefits of self-help but cautioned that good intentions were not sufficient to assure the efficacy and safety of self-administered instructional programs. Rosen and colleagues observed that many psychologists promote untested self-help programs rather than contributing to the meaningful advancement of self-help.

From a sociological perspective, self-help is often criticized for inculcating a model of a self-reliant and precarious worker-citizen who does not rely on state support and contributes to a productive labor-force. Self-help hence promotes and globalizes a capitalist version of individualism and personal development, producing new anxieties while also enabling people to imagine and simulate (through reading, workshops, training) their desired ideals of personhood.

==In the media==
Kathryn Schulz suggests that &quot;the underlying theory of the self-help industry is contradicted by the self-help industry’s existence&quot;.

===Parodies and fictional analogies===
The self-help world has become the target of parodies. Walker Percy&#x27;s odd genre-busting &quot;Lost in the Cosmos&quot; has been described as &quot;a parody of self-help books, a philosophy textbook, and a collection of short stories, quizzes, diagrams, thought experiments, mathematical formulas, made-up dialogue&quot;.

Al Franken&#x27;s self-help guru persona Stuart Smalley was a ridiculous recurring feature on Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s.

In their 2006 book &quot;Secrets of The SuperOptimist&quot;, authors W.R. Morton and Nathaniel Whitten revealed the concept of &quot;super optimism&quot; as a humorous antidote to the overblown self-help book category.

In his comedy special &quot;Complaints and Grievances&quot; (2001), George Carlin observes that there is &quot;no such thing&quot; as self-help: anyone looking for help from someone else does not technically get &quot;self&quot; help; and one who accomplishes something without help did not need help to begin with.

In Margaret Atwood&#x27;s semi-satiric dystopia &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, university literary studies have declined to the point that the protagonist, Snowman, is instructed to write his thesis on self-help books as literature; more revealing of the authors and of the society that produced them than genuinely helpful.

<text>Empire of the Sun is a 1987 American epic coming-of-age war film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tom Stoppard, based on J. G. Ballard&#x27;s semi-autobiographical 1984 novel of the same name. The film tells the story of Jamie &quot;Jim&quot; Graham (Christian Bale), a young boy who goes from living with his wealthy British family in Shanghai to becoming a prisoner of war in an internment camp operated by the Japanese during World War II.

Harold Becker and David Lean were originally to direct before Spielberg came on board, initially as a producer for Lean. Spielberg was attracted to directing the film because of a personal connection to Lean&#x27;s films and World War II topics. He considers it to be his most profound work on &quot;the loss of innocence&quot;. The film received positive reviews, with praise towards Bale&#x27;s performance, the cinematography, the visuals, Williams&#x27;s score and Spielberg&#x27;s direction. However, the film was not initially a commercial success, earning only $22 million at the US box office, although it eventually more than recouped its budget through revenues in foreign markets, home video, and television.
==Plot==

Amid Japan&#x27;s invasion of China during World War II, Jamie &quot;Jim&quot; Graham is a British upper middle class schoolboy enjoying a privileged life in the Shanghai International Settlement. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan begins occupying the settlement. As the Graham family evacuate the city, Jamie is separated from his parents and makes his way back to their house, assuming they will return. After a length of time alone and having eaten the remaining food, he ventures back into the city.

Hungry, Jamie tries surrendering to Japanese soldiers, who ignore him. After being chased by a street urchin, he is taken in by two American expatriates and hustlers, Basie and Frank. Unable to sell Jamie, they intend to abandon him in the streets, but he offers to lead them to his neighbourhood to loot the empty houses there. He is surprised to see lights on in his family home and thinks his parents have returned, only to discover that the house is occupied by Japanese troops. The trio are taken prisoner, transported to the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre in Shanghai for processing, and sent to an internment camp in Suzhou.

Now it is 1945, nearing the end of the Pacific War and World War II, and despite the terror and poor living conditions of the camp, Jim survives by establishing a trading network—which even involves the camp&#x27;s commander, Sergeant Nagata. Dr. Rawlins, the camp&#x27;s British doctor, becomes a father figure and teacher to Jim. One night after a bombing raid, Nagata orders the destruction of the prisoners&#x27; infirmary as a reprisal but stops when Jim begs forgiveness. Through the barbed wire fencing, Jim befriends a Japanese teenager who is a trainee pilot.

One morning, the base is attacked by American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft. Jim is overjoyed and climbs the ruins of a nearby pagoda to better watch the action. Dr. Rawlins chases him up the pagoda to save him, whereupon Jim breaks down in tears—saying he cannot remember what his parents look like. As a result of the attack, the Japanese evacuate the camp. As they leave, Jim&#x27;s trainee pilot friend goes through the ritual kamikaze preparation and attempts to take off in a Japanese attack plane. The trainee is devastated when the engine sputters and dies.

The camp prisoners march through the wilderness, where many die from fatigue, starvation, and disease. Arriving at a football stadium near Nantou City, where many of the Shanghai inhabitants&#x27; possessions have been stored by the Japanese, Jim recognises his parents&#x27; Packard car. He spends the night there with Mrs. Victor, a fellow prisoner who dies shortly thereafter, and witnesses flashes from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki hundreds of miles away.

Jim wanders back to the Suzhou camp. Along the way, he hears news of Japan&#x27;s surrender and the war&#x27;s end. He is reunited with the now-disillusioned Japanese teenage pilot, who remembers Jim and offers him a mango, drawing his guntō to cut it. Basie appears with a group of armed Americans to loot the Red Cross containers being airdropped over the area. One of the Americans, thinking Jim is in danger, shoots and kills the Japanese youth. Basie offers to have Jim come along with them, but he chooses to stay behind.

He is later found by American soldiers and placed in an orphanage, where he is reunited with his mother and father, though he does not recognise them at first.

==Cast==
Author J. G. Ballard makes a cameo appearance as a house party guest.

==Production==
===Development===

Warner Bros. purchased the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard wrote the first draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, &quot;I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up because I thought it was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve.&quot; Spielberg felt &quot;from the moment I read J. G. Ballard&#x27;s novel I secretly wanted to direct myself.&quot; Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favourite film was Lean&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg&#x27;s fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father&#x27;s stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited re-write before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.

===Casting===
J.G. Ballard felt Bale had a physical resemblance to himself at the same age. The actor was 12 years old when he was cast. Amy Irving, Bale&#x27;s co-star in the television movie &quot;&quot;, recommended Bale to her then-husband, Steven Spielberg, for the role. More than 4,000 child actors auditioned. Jim&#x27;s singing voice was provided by English performer James Rainbird.

===Filming===
&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was filmed at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on location in Shanghai and Spain. Principal photography began on 1 March 1987, and lasted for 16 weeks. The filmmakers searched across Asia in an attempt to find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city blocks for filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some old enough to remember the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.

Spielberg attempted to portray the era accurately, using period vehicles and aircraft. Four Harvard SNJ aircraft were lightly modified in France to resemble Mitsubishi A6M Zero aircraft. Two additional non-flying replicas were used. Three restored P-51D Mustangs, two from &#x27;The Fighter Collection&#x27; of England, and one from the &#x27;Old Flying Machine Company&#x27;, were flown in the film. These P-51s were flown by Ray Hanna (who was featured in the film flying at low-level past the child star with the canopy back, waving), his son Mark and &quot;Hoof&quot; Proudfoot and took over 10 days of filming to complete due to the complexity of the planned aerial sequences, which included the P-51s actually dropping plaster-filled replica 500 lb bombs at low level, with simulated bomb blasts. A number of large scale remote control flying models were also used, including an 18-foot wingspan B-29, but Spielberg felt the results were disappointing, so he extended the film contract with the full-size examples and pilots on set in Trebujena, Spain.

Spielberg had wanted to film in Super Panavision 70 but did not want to work with the old camera equipment that was only available at the time.

===Special effects===
Industrial Light &amp; Magic designed the visual effects sequences with some computer-generated imagery also used for the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Norman Reynolds was hired as the production designer while Vic Armstrong served as the stunt co-ordinator.

==Reception ==
&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was given a limited release on 11 December 1987 before being widely released on Christmas Day, 1987. The film earned $22.24 million in North America, and $44.46 million in other countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $66.7 million, earning more than its budget but still considered a box office disappointment by Spielberg.

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 77% based on reviews from 64 critics, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;One of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s most ambitious efforts of the 1980s, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; remains an under-rated gem in the director&#x27;s distinguished filmography.&quot; Metacritic calculated an average score of 62 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

J. G. Ballard gave positive feedback, and was especially impressed with Christian Bale&#x27;s performance. Critical reaction was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; stated that Spielberg &quot;has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density of images and emotions&quot;. Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Spielberg&#x27;s movie-conscious spirit gave it &quot;a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable&quot;. Julie Salamon of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard&#x27;s extraordinary war experience.&quot; J. Hoberman from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;shamelessly kiddiecentric&quot; approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, &quot;Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn&#x27;t much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad.&quot; On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film &quot;is basically a good idea for a film that never gets off the ground&quot;. Siskel added, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the film is about. It&#x27;s so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it wants to say something about a child&#x27;s-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children&#x27;s view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you&#x27;ve got like &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don&#x27;t know what Spielberg wanted to do.&quot;

===Awards ===

The film won awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for Best Film and Best Director, and Bale received a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor, the first National Board award bestowed on a child actor. At the 60th Academy Awards, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was nominated for Art Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design (Bob Ringwood), Film Editing, Original Music Score, and Sound (Robert Knudson, Don Digirolamo, John Boyd and Tony Dawe). It did not convert any of the nominations into awards. Allen Daviau, who was nominated as cinematographer, publicly complained, &quot;I can&#x27;t second-guess the Academy, but I feel very sorry that I get nominations and Steven doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s his vision that makes it all come together, and if Steven wasn&#x27;t making these films, none of us would be here.&quot; The film won awards for cinematography, sound design, and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards. The nominations included production design, costume design, and adapted screenplay. Spielberg was honored for this work by the Directors Guild of America, while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau. &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was nominated for Best Motion Picture (Drama) and Original Score at the 45th Golden Globe Awards. John Williams earned a Grammy Award nomination.

==Themes==
Jim&#x27;s growing alienation from his pre-war self and society is reflected in his hero-worship of the Japanese aviators based at the airfield adjoining the camp. &quot;I think it&#x27;s true that the Japanese were pretty brutal with the Chinese, so I don&#x27;t have any particularly sentimental view of them,&quot; Ballard recalled. &quot;But small boys tend to find their heroes where they can. One thing there was no doubt about, and that was that the Japanese were extremely brave. One had very complicated views about patriotism [and] loyalty to one&#x27;s own nation. Jim is constantly identifying himself, first with the Japanese; then, when the Americans start flying over in their Mustangs and B-29s, he&#x27;s very drawn to the American.&quot;

The apocalyptic wartime setting and the climactic moment when Jim sees the distant white flash of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki gave Spielberg powerful visual metaphors &quot;to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy&#x27;s innocence and the death of the innocence of the entire world&quot;. Spielberg reflected he &quot;was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence, not an attenuation of childhood, which by my own admission and everybody&#x27;s impression of me is what my life has been. This was the opposite of Peter Pan. This was a boy who had grown up too quickly.&quot; Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, include a child being separated from his parents (&quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, and &quot;Poltergeist&quot;) and World War II (&quot;1941&quot;, and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;). Spielberg explained &quot;My parents got a divorce when I was 14, 15. The whole thing about separation is something that runs very deep in anyone exposed to divorce.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The dramatic attack on the Japanese prisoner of war camp carried out by P-51 Mustangs is accompanied by Jim&#x27;s whoops of &quot;...the Cadillac of the skies!&quot;, a phrase believed to be first used in Ballard&#x27;s text as &quot;Cadillac of air combat&quot;. Steven Bull quotes the catchwords in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Military Technology and Innovation&quot; (2004) as originating in 1941. John Williams&#x27;s soundtrack includes &quot;Cadillac of the Skies&quot; as an individual score cue.

Ben Stiller conceived the idea for &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; while performing in &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;.

<text>The University of New South Wales (UNSW), also known as UNSW Sydney, is a public research university based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the founding members of Group of Eight, a coalition of Australian research-intensive universities.

Established in 1949, UNSW is a research university and a member of Universitas 21, a global network of research universities. It has international exchange and research partnerships with over 200 universities around the world. 

The university comprises seven faculties, through which it offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees. The main campus is in the Eastern Suburbs in the suburb of Kensington, from the Sydney central business district (CBD). The creative arts school, UNSW Art &amp; Design (in the faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture), is located in Paddington, and subcampuses are located in the Sydney CBD as well as several other suburbs, including Randwick and Coogee. Research stations are located throughout the state of New South Wales.

The university&#x27;s second largest campus, known as UNSW Canberra at ADFA (formerly known as UNSW at ADFA), abbreviated to UNSW Canberra, is situated in Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). ADFA is the military academy of the Australian Defence Force, and UNSW Canberra is the only national academic institution with a defence focus.

==History==
===Foundation===

The origins of the university can be traced to the Sydney Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts established in 1833 and the Sydney Technical College established in 1878. These institutions were established to meet the growing demand for capabilities in new technologies as the New South Wales economy shifted from its pastoral base to industries fuelled by the industrial age.

The idea of founding the university originated from the crisis demands of World War II, during which the nation&#x27;s attention was drawn to the critical role that science and technology played in transforming an agricultural society into a modern and industrial one. The post-war Labor government of New South Wales recognised the increasing need to have a university specialised in training high-quality engineers and technology-related professionals in numbers beyond that of the capacity and characteristics of the existing University of Sydney. This led to the proposal to establish the Institute of Technology, submitted by the then-New South Wales Minister for Education Bob Heffron, accepted on 9 July 1946.

The university, originally named the &quot;New South Wales University of Technology&quot;, gained its statutory status through the enactment of the &quot;New South Wales University of Technology Act 1949 (NSW)&quot; by the Parliament of New South Wales in Sydney in 1949.

=== Early years ===
In March 1948, classes commenced with a first intake of 46 students pursuing programs including civil engineering, mechanical engineering, mining engineering, and electrical engineering. At that time, the thesis programs were innovative. Each course embodied a specified and substantial period of practical training in the relevant industry. It was also unprecedented for tertiary institutions at that time to include compulsory instruction in humanities.

Initially, the university operated from the inner Sydney Technical College city campus in Ultimo as a separate institution from the college. However, in 1951, the Parliament of New South Wales passed the &quot;New South Wales University of Technology (Construction) Act 1951 (NSW)&quot; to provide funding and allow buildings to be erected at the Kensington site where the university is now located.

The lower campus area of the Kensington campus was vested in the university in two lots, in December 1952 and June 1954. The upper campus area was vested in the university in November 1959.

===Expansion===
In 1958, the university&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;University of New South Wales&quot; reflecting a transformation from a technology-based institution to a generalist university. In 1960, the faculties of arts and medicine were established, with the faculty of law coming into being in 1971.

The university&#x27;s first director was Arthur Denning (1949–1952), who made important contributions to founding the university. In 1953, he was replaced by Philip Baxter, who continued as vice-chancellor when this position&#x27;s title was changed in 1955. Baxter&#x27;s dynamic, if authoritarian, management was central to the university&#x27;s first 20 years. His visionary, but at times controversial, energies saw the university grow from a handful to 15,000 students by 1968. The new vice-chancellor, Rupert Myers (1969–1981), brought consolidation and an urbane management style to a period of expanding student numbers, demand for change in university style, and challenges of student unrest.

In 1962, the academic book publishing company University of New South Wales Press was launched. Now an ACNC not-for-profit entity, it has three divisions: NewSouth Publishing (the publishing arm of the company), NewSouth Books (the sales, marketing and distribution part of the company), and the UNSW Bookshop, situated at the Kensington campus.

The stabilising techniques of the 1980s managed by the vice-chancellor, Michael Birt (1981–1992), provided a firm base for the energetic corporatism and campus enhancements pursued by the subsequent vice-chancellor, John Niland (1992–2002). The 1990s had the addition of fine arts to the university. The university established colleges in Newcastle (1951) and Wollongong (1961), which eventually became the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong in 1965 and 1975, respectively.

The former St George Institute of Education (part of the short-lived Sydney College of Advanced Education) amalgamated with the university from 1 January 1990, resulting in the formation of a School of Teacher Education at the former SGIE campus at Oatley. A School of Sports and Leisure Studies and a School of Arts and Music Education were also subsequently based at St George. The campus was closed in 1999.

===Recent history===
In 2012, private sources contributed 45% of the university&#x27;s annual funding.

In 2010, the Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Australia&#x27;s first facility to bring together researchers in childhood and adult cancer, costing $127 million, opened.

In 2003, the university was invited by Singapore&#x27;s Economic Development Board to consider opening a campus there. Following a 2004 decision to proceed, the first phase of a planned $200 m campus opened in 2007. Students and staff were sent home and the campus closed after one semester following substantial financial losses.

In 2008, it collaborated with two other universities in forming The Centre for Social Impact. In 2019, the university moved to a trimester timetable as part of UNSW&#x27;s 2025 Strategy. Under the trimester timetable, the study load changed from offering four subjects per 13-week semester, to three subjects per 10-week term. The change to trimesters has been widely criticised by staff and students as a money-making move, with little consideration as to the well-being of students.

In 2012, UNSW Press celebrated its 50th anniversary and launched the UNSW Bragg Prize for Science Writing. The annual Best Australian Science Writing anthology contains the winning and shortlisted entries among a collection of the year&#x27;s writing from Australian authors, journalists and scientists and is published annually in the NewSouth imprint under a different editorship. The UNSW Press Bragg Student Prize is for science writing by Australian high school students and is supported by the Copyright Agency Cultural Fund and UNSW Science.

In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, the University of New South Wales recorded the lowest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, with an overall satisfaction rating of 62.9, which was lower than the overall national average of 78.4. UNSW&#x27;s low student satisfaction numbers for 2019 was attributed to the university&#x27;s switch to a trimester system. In the 2021 Student Experience Survey, the University of New South Wales recorded the lowest student satisfaction rating out of all New South Wales universities, and the second lowest nationwide behind the University of Melbourne, with an overall satisfaction rating of 66.9, which was lower than the overall national average of 73.

On 15 July 2020, the university announced 493 job cuts and a 25 percent reduction in management due to the effects of COVID-19 and a $370 million budget shortfall.

In October 2021, UNSW established Mentem by UNSW to help organisations upskill and reskill their workforces. Mentem helps organisation achieve strategic goals and measures completion and success rates through their bespoke insights platform. In September 2022 Mentem won Best in Class at the Australian Good Design awards for the work with Department of regional NSW government, creating a learning program to uplift staff in digital literacy.

In May 2022, UNSW announced the university had received a $4.7 million in funding in order to pursue health prevention research. The funding aims to fund research on infectious diseases, drug and alcohol use and primary health care. Announced as part of NSW Health&#x27;s Prevention Research Support Program (PRSP), the research is designed to support NWS research organisations conducting prevention and early intervention research.

The main UNSW campus, where most faculties are situated, is located on a site in Kensington, Sydney. UNSW Art &amp; Design is located in the inner suburb of Paddington.

The main UNSW campus in Kensington is divided geographically into two areas: upper campus and lower campus, which were vested to the university in three separate lots. These two are separated mainly by an elevation rise between the quadrangle and the Scientia building. Roughly 15 minutes are needed to walk from one end to the other.

UNSW Canberra at ADFA (formerly known as UNSW at ADFA), abbreviated to UNSW Canberra, is situated in Canberra. Its students are from the military academy known as ADFA, who are in training for the Australian Defence Force, and as such has an integrated defence focus, with particular strengths in defence-related, security and engineering research.

The university also has additional campuses and field stations in Randwick, Coogee, Botany, Dee Why, Cowan, Manly Vale, Fowlers Gap, Port Macquarie, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Coffs Harbour, Griffith, and Bankstown Airport.

===Venues and other facilities===

A number of theatre and music venues are at the university, many of which are available for hire to the general public. The UNSW Fitness and Aquatic Centre provides health and fitness facilities and services to both students and the general public.

==Governance and structure==
=== University Council ===
The university is governed by the university council, which is responsible for acting on the university&#x27;s behalf to promote its objectives and interests. The council comprises 15 members, including the chancellor, vice-chancellor, president of the academic board, two members appointed by the minister for education, five members appointed by the council, three members elected by university staff and two student-elected members.

The principal academic body is the Academic Board, which receives advice on academic matters from the faculties, college (Australian Defence Force Academy), and the boards of studies. It is responsible for academic policy setting, academic strategy via its eight standing committees, approval and delivery of programs, and academic standards. The board comprises 63 members, including the Vice-Chancellor, members of the executive team, deans and faculty presiding members, members elected from the academic staff, and six from the student body. The board advises the vice-chancellor and council on matters relating to teaching, scholarship and research and takes decisions on delegation from the council.

==== Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor ====
The chief executive officer of the university is the president and vice-chancellor, currently Attila Brungs. The deputy vice-chancellors and pro-vice-chancellors form part of an executive team that are responsible for academic operations, research policy, research management, quality assurance and external relations, including philanthropy and advancement.

Each of the faculties has its respective board, which are responsible for the teaching and examining of subjects within their scope.

=== Faculties and departments ===

The university has six faculties:

*UNSW Faculty of Arts, Design &amp; Architecture
*UNSW Faculty of Business
*UNSW Faculty of Engineering
*UNSW Faculty of Law and Justice
*UNSW Faculty of Medicine &amp; Health
*UNSW Faculty of Science
*UNSW Canberra at ADFA

The university also has an association with the National Institute of Dramatic Art.
===Heraldry and insignia===
====Coat of arms====
The grant of arms was made by the College of Arms on 3 March 1952. The grant reads:
:&quot;Argent on a Cross Gules a Lion passant guardant between four Mullets of eight points Or a Chief Sable charged with an open Book proper thereon the word &quot;SCIENTIA&quot; in letters also sable.&quot;
The lion and the four stars of the Southern Cross on the St George&#x27;s Cross have reference to the State of New South Wales which established the university; the open book with &quot;scientia&quot; (&quot;knowledge&quot;) across its pages is a reminder of its purpose. The placement of &quot;scientia&quot; on the book was inspired by its appearance on the arms of Imperial College London formed in 1907. Beneath the shield are the Latin words within a scroll: &quot;Corde Manu et Mente&quot; (&quot;heart, hand and mind&quot;), which when combined with &quot;scientia&quot; forms the Latin motto of the university: &quot;Scientia Corde Manu et Mente&quot; or &#x27;Knowledge by heart, hand and mind&#x27;. Following the rules of English heraldry, the motto does not form part of the original grant of arms from 1952, and consequently does not require the formal alteration of the original grant by the College of Arms. The original motto of the university from 1952, however was &quot;Scientia Manu et Mente&quot; (&quot;Knowledge by hand and mind&quot;), which used the earlier motto of the Sydney Technical College (&quot;Manu et Mente&quot; or &#x27;by hand and mind&#x27;) from which the university developed. In 2021, the motto was changed with approval from the College of Arms to its current form to reflect the university&#x27;s brand concept of &#x27;collective difference&#x27;.

An update of the design and colours of the arms was undertaken in 1970, which provided a more contemporary design, yet retained all the arms&#x27; heraldic associations. In 1994, the university title was added to the UNSW arms, as was the abbreviation &quot;UNSW&quot;, to create the UNSW symbol that is used for everyday and marketing purposes. In late 2013, the university launched a new change to the business name used in all branding and marketing as &quot;UNSW Australia&quot;. In January 2017, this was changed again to &quot;UNSW Sydney&quot;, with the ADFA Canberra campus changed to &quot;UNSW Canberra&quot;. The official name of the university, which requires an amending act of Parliament to the University of New South Wales Act 1989 to alter, is unchanged.

===University mace===
The ceremonial mace of the university is made of stainless steel with silver facings and a shaft of eumung timber. On the head are mounted four silver shields, two engraved with the arms of the State of New South Wales and two with the original-design arms of the university. A silver Waratah, NSW&#x27;s floral emblem, surmounts the head. The mace was donated to the university by BHP and was presented by the company&#x27;s chairman, Colin Syme, on 6 December 1962. A former NSW Government Architect, Cobden Parkes, was appointed as the first official mace-bearer.

== Academic profile ==

===Research divisions===

The university has a number of purpose-built research facilities, including:

*UNSW Lowy Cancer Research Centre is Australia&#x27;s first facility bringing together researchers in childhood and adult cancers, as well as one of the country&#x27;s largest cancer-research facilities, housing up to 400 researchers. 
*The Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre is a centre for the faculties of science, medicine, and engineering. It is used to study the structure and composition of biological, chemical, and physical materials.

=== Student outcomes ===
The Australian Government&#x27;s QILT conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment. These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.

In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 85.5%.

In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 81.3% for undergraduates and 91.7% for postgraduates. The initial full-time salary was for undergraduates and for postgraduates.

In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 71.7% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 78%.

=== Engagement with schools ===
UNSW engages with primary and secondary education, administering several national and international academic competitions for school age children. These include:
* The Australian Schools Science Competition – International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) is conducted by Educational Assessment Australia, UNSW Global Pty Limited. UNSW Global is a not-for-profit provider of education, training and consulting services and a wholly owned enterprise of the University of New South Wales. It provides exams for students in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, South Africa, Indonesia, Hong Kong, India and the Pacific region. It caters to students from year 3 (Australia) through year 12, examining skills in English, mathematics, science, computers, writing and spelling.
* International Competitions and Assessments for Schools-Mathematics – International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS). From 2003 to 2005, ICAS-Mathematics was called Australasian Schools Mathematics Assessment. Prior to 2003, it was known as the Primary Schools Mathematics Competition and was targeted at primary schools.
* The UNSW School Mathematics Competition – Since 1962, the School of Mathematics and Statistics has run the UNSW School Mathematics Competition. This competition is a three-hour open book Olympiad-style exam designed to assess mathematical insight and ingenuity rather than efficiency in tackling routine examples. Competition results are used as part of the assessment criteria for some university scholarships awarded by the UNSW School of Mathematics and Statistics.
* The UNSW COMPUTING ProgComp – Since 1997, The School of Computer Science and Engineering (UNSW COMPUTING) has run the UNSW COMPUTING ProgComp. This competition has the overall aim of raising awareness amongst high school students of the craft of programming and to encourage students to develop and apply their computing knowledge and skills.
* The UNSW COMPUTING Robotics Workshops – UNSW School of Computer Science and Engineering (UNSW COMPUTING) has developed specialised robotic workshops for school students. They focus on the use of the Lego NXT technology combined with the popular RoboCup Junior competition for schools. UNSW COMPUTING is also a national and NSW state sponsor of RoboCup Junior.

==== Educational Assessment Australia ====
Educational Assessment Australia (EAA) is a not-for-profit organisation previously owned by the University of New South Wales. It was acquired by Janison Education Group on 31 May 2020. It is a national and international educational assessment organisation specialising in large-scale assessment programs including the International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, India, South Africa and the Pacific region. EAA also provides scanning, data analysis and reporting services to commercial and educational institutions.

=== Admissions ===
Entry to a particular undergraduate degree program for domestic students generally requires a certain Australian Tertiary Admission Rank, which varies by course. Some programs also take into account, in addition to a particular ATAR mark, performance in specialised tests, such as the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test for medicine and the Law Admission Test for law.

In 2017, UNSW enrolled the highest number of Australia&#x27;s top 500 high school students academically. 

In 2019, UNSW had the most first preferences for high school students in the state of New South Wales.

The university offers a bonus points scheme, &quot;HSC Plus&quot;, which awards up to a maximum of 5 points for performance in year 12 Australian Senior Secondary Certificate courses relevant to UNSW undergraduate degrees. The scheme does not apply to actuarial studies, law, medicine or psychology.

UNSW offers several scholarships and support programs to high achieving students. The Co-op program is a scholarship and industry engagement program awarded to students across many programs in the built environment, engineering, science and the Australian School of Business. Students usually enter the program after an application and interview while in their final year of high school. The university also offers Scientia Scholarships to a number of commencing students who performed exceptionally in the Higher School Certificate, which provide funding of $10,000 per year for the duration of the student&#x27;s program. This is different from the Scientia PhD scholarship, which awards PhD scholarship with a package of $50,000 per annum, comprising a tax-free living allowance of $40,000 per annum for 4 years, and a support package of up to $10,000 per annum.

UNSW also offers a mature age entry scheme, the University Preparation Program for students aged 20 or older, that can provide the requirements for entry into UNSW or other universities.

==Student life==
===Student union===


&quot;Arc @ UNSW Limited&quot; is the student organisation at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and is a not-for-profit public company.

In 2005, the Federal Parliament passed legislation making membership of student unions voluntary for the first time. This policy, known as voluntary student unionism (VSU), threatened the funding model behind the four UNSW student organisations with compulsory membership provisions. A report commissioned by the university administration recommended that three of those organisations – the Student Guild of Undergraduates and Postgraduates, the University of New South Wales Union and the College of Fine Arts Students&#x27; Association – merge into a single student organisation, a structure in use at the University of Melbourne.
Arc was established on 15 August 2006 and launched early the following year, taking over the functions of three existing student organisations, the UNSW Student Guild, UNSW Union, and COFA Students&#x27; Association.

The organisation supports the activities of student clubs, student volunteer programs such as orientation week, student publications, two student galleries (Kudos Gallery and AD Space), and houses an elected student representative council. Arc operates the Roundhouse entertainment venue, the Graduation &amp; Gift Store on UNSW&#x27;s main campus in Kensington, and until recently, The Whitehouse bar and café which shut down permanently on 23 April 2021. Arc also operates a student support service, providing legal and academic advocacy. Arc@UNSW exists independently from UNSW.

Arc has three constitutional student bodies: 
# the Student Development Committee (SDC) – supporting clubs, volunteer programs, courses and activities, 
# the Postgraduate Council (PGC) – representing the postgraduate community at UNSW and 
# an elected Student Representative Council (SRC)

The student organisation is a major service provider on campus, running a number of retail outlets, student media such as &quot;Tharunka&quot; and an entertainment venue, the Roundhouse. The Arc Student Representative Council represents students to the university and nationally and fights for their rights. Arc also provides support and funding to university clubs and societies and runs student volunteer programs such as Orientation Week.

In 2007, the University of New South Wales Sports Association and UNSW Lifestyle Centre merged to become UNSW Sport and Recreation then later absorbed into Arc @ UNSW to become Arc Sport. It runs the external sporting facilities and services and supports the 30 UNSW affiliated sporting clubs that compete both at home and abroad.

=== Student media ===
==== &quot;Blitz&quot; ====
&quot;Blitz&quot; is a student publication, published online by Arc @ UNSW, based at the University of New South Wales. &quot;Blitz&quot; under this name first appeared in session 2, 1988, but a similar &quot;what&#x27;s on&quot; style publication had been issued by the then University Union since the early 1970s. Initially it consisted of a simple sheet or two of paper, but it evolved into a magazine style format in session two 1994 when a former editor from another student publication on campus, &quot;Tharunka&quot;, was hired to found a weekly &quot;what&#x27;s on&quot; magazine. &quot;Blitz&quot; sometimes pays casual contributors for submitted articles and photographs, and employs a student online editor, a student designer, a student TV producer and a student radio producer.

&quot;Blitz&quot; typically covers the goings-on around campus and conducts interviews and publishes stories relating to current student activities. It widely publicises Arc services and activities on campus. Due to its non-partisan policy, it does not cover political issues, with the exception of voluntary student unionism. However, in 2004 an edition of &quot;Blitz&quot; was withdrawn by the student union because it contained a guide to rolling a joint. The editor Janet Duncan claimed there had been censorship of her editorial in the following issue. Arc @ UNSW announced that the organisation would continue to publish the magazine after the introduction of voluntary student unionism in 2007.

==== &quot;Gamamari&quot; ====

&quot;Tharunka,&quot; thought to mean &quot;message stick&quot; in an Aboriginal language, is a student newspaper originally published by the UNSW Students Union from 1953 until 1992, when that body was replaced by the University of New South Wales Student Guild. The Guild published &quot;Tharunka&quot; from 1993 until 2006 and the successor student organisation, Arc @ UNSW Limited, continued the publication of &quot;Tharunka&quot; from 2007. The publication changed its name in mid-2024 to &quot;Gamamari,&quot; meaning “talking for a purpose” in the Dharawal Language.

&quot;Tharunka&quot; is managed by a small editorial team and actively solicits contributions from the UNSW student body. Including staff wages, the publication&#x27;s budget is under $50,000 per year.

=== Student accommodation ===
The university has a number of residential accommodation options, including Philip Baxter College, Basser College, Goldstein College, Fig Tree Hall, Colombo House, UNSW Hall, International House, New College and New College Village, Warrane College; Shalom College, and Creston College, and UNSW Village.

===Exchange programs===
The university has overseas exchange programs with over 250 overseas partner institutions. These include Princeton University, McGill University, Penn State University, University of Pennsylvania (inc. Wharton), Duke University, Drexel University, Johns Hopkins University, Brown University, Columbia University (summer law students only), University of California Berkeley, University of California Santa Cruz (inc. Baskin), UCLA, University of Michigan (inc. Ross), New York University (inc.

UNSW has produced more millionaires than any other Australian university, according to the Spear&#x27;s Wealth Management Survey in 2016.

Engineers Australia ranked UNSW as having the highest number of graduates in &quot;Australia&#x27;s Top 100 Influential Engineers 2013&quot; list at 23%, followed by Monash University at 8%, the University of Western Australia, University of Sydney and the University of Queensland at 7%.

== Controversies ==
In 1975, the High Court of Australia delivered the decision in &quot;University of NSW v Moorhouse&quot; that UNSW authorised copyright infringement by providing coin operated photocopy machines, without taking proper measures to prevent an infringement. As a result, the Copyright Act 1968 was amended to state that libraries are not authorising copyright infringement if a notice is set out that displays relevant provision of the Act near the photocopy machine.

On 19 April 2000, postgraduate student Lin Chun was crushed on campus by an unmanned truck that rolled down a slope. She later died on campus as a result of her injuries. The university denied liability over the accident.

In 2007, UNSW opened a campus in Singapore following an invitation by Singapore&#x27;s Economic Development Board to open a campus. However, one semester later, students and staff were sent home, and the campus was closed due to lack of enrolments, resulting in a loss of $15 million to the university.

In February 2007, UNSW publicly apologised after a police probe revealed that bodies donated to train surgeons were possibly fondled by a member of the staff, resulting in the sacking of one staff member and another staff member quitting.

In July 2009, a field trip organised by the School of Biological Earth and Environmental Sciences near Darling Harbour resulted in a research assistant losing control of an inflatable vessel while performing a turn causing three passengers who were not wearing lifejackets, to fall off, including one that suffered from a broken wrist and severe injuries to her leg. In 2013, the university was fined $100,000 after the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales launched legal action.

In 2012, PhD student Rui Zhang threw sulfuric acid at another student, before attacking him with a hammer inside a chemistry lab at the university. The judge later found Rui not guilty on grounds of mental illness.

In October 2015, UNSW issued a security warning after an anonymous threat was made on 4chan, stating &quot;I finally managed to get a handgun. Australians, if you study at UNSW don’t go in tomorrow&quot;, resulting in state and federal police swarming the campus the next morning.

In January 2018, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal held that UNSW had violated the &quot;Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act&quot; &quot;1998&quot; after a student had their PhD candidature terminated by the university. As a result, the student made a Government Information request, asking for their student file and reasons for termination to make a formal complaint against 19 university staff members. However, upon processing the request, a staff member leaked the complaint to individuals who were on the listed in the complaint.

In August 2020, after the Chinese government cracked down on liberties in Hong Kong, the UNSW posted a tweet promoting a call by Elaine Pearson (a human rights expert and adjunct law lecturer at the university) for the United Nations to take steps on human rights violations in Hong Kong. Chinese state-owned media, as well as some Chinese students, responded with anger, and UNSW then deleted the tweet. The deletion of the tweet was condemned by many Australian Federal MPs as a violation of free-speech principles. Chinese-Australian artist Badiucao also suggested that pro-democracy Chinese students were living in &#x27;fear&#x27;. UNSW vice-chancellor Ian Jacobs issued an apology, saying that the decision to remove the tweet was a &quot;mistake&quot;; that the university was &quot;does not take official political positions&quot;; and that he &quot;unequivocally&quot; reaffirmed the university&#x27;s &quot;previous commitment to freedom of expression and academic freedom.&quot; The university came under fire for a Chinese-language message sent by UNSW Global&#x27;s CEO, Laurie Pearcey, two days earlier. That message failed to make any mention of freedom of speech and did not describe the deletion of the post as a &quot;mistake&quot;; this prompted Federal MPs to accuse the university of sending mixed messages.

In October 2021, UNSW launched an investigative review after claims of research misconduct on studies pertaining to ageing were made. More than a dozen papers, co-authored by researchers at UNSW, along with other universities were published on PubPeer and found to have duplicated photos that had been modified to represent different experimental results. However, two years later, preliminary assessments of the allegations had not been completed, resulting in an investigation by the Australian Research Integrity Committee in 2023.

In 2021, UNSW began remediating underpayments to casual academic staff for the period between January 2014 to December 2020, setting aside more than $36 million to back-pay academics and had already paid $11 million by 2023. In 2023, the Fair Work Ombudsman launched legal action against UNSW in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, alleging that UNSW had poor payroll practices and that UNSW &quot;knew&quot; that casual academics were being underpaid.

<doc id="146080" wikidata="Q219577" url="?curid=146080" title="Holding company">
<text>A holding company is a company whose primary business is holding a controlling interest in the securities of other companies. A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself. Its purpose is to own stock of other companies to form a corporate group.

In some jurisdictions around the world, holding companies are called parent companies, which, besides holding stock in other companies, can conduct trade and other business activities themselves. Holding companies reduce risk for the shareholders, and can permit the ownership and control of a number of different companies. &quot;The New York Times&quot; uses the term &quot;parent holding company&quot;. Holding companies can be subsidiaries in a tiered structure.

Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as intellectual property or trade secrets, that are protected from the operating company. That creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation.

In the United States, 80% of stock, in voting and value, must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed. That is, if Company A owns 80% or more of the stock of Company B, Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders, as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash within a single enterprise. Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends, as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders.

Sometimes, a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding &quot;Holding&quot; or &quot;Holdings&quot; to its name.

==By country==
===Australia===
The parent company–subsidiary company relationship is defined by Part 1.2, Division 6, Section 46 of the &quot;Corporations Act 2001&quot; (Cth), which states:
A body corporate (in this section called the first body) is a subsidiary of another body corporate if, and only if:
:(a) the other body:
::(i) controls the composition of the first body&#x27;s board; or
::(ii) is in a position to cast, or control the casting of, more than one-half of the maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general meeting of the first body; or
::(iii) holds more than one-half of the issued share capital of the first body (excluding any part of that issued share capital that carries no right to participate beyond a specified amount in a distribution of either profits or capital); or
:(b) the first body is a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the other body.
===Canada===
Toronto-based lawyer Michael Finley has stated, &quot;The emerging trend that has seen international plaintiffs permitted to proceed with claims against Canadian parent companies for the allegedly wrongful activity of their foreign subsidiaries means that the corporate veil is no longer a silver bullet to the heart of a plaintiff&#x27;s case.&quot;

===Singapore===
The parent subsidiary company relationship is defined by Part 1, Section 5, Subsection 1 of the Companies Act, which states:
5.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, a corporation shall, subject to subsection (3), be deemed to be a subsidiary of another corporation, if —
:(a) that other corporation —
::(i) controls the composition of the board of directors of the first-mentioned corporation; or
:::[Act 36 of 2014 wef 01/07/2015]
::(ii) controls more than half of the voting power of the first-mentioned corporation; or
::(iii) [Deleted by Act 36 of 2014 wef 01/07/2015]
:(b) the first-mentioned corporation is a subsidiary of any corporation which is that other corporation&#x27;s subsidiary
===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, is generally held that an organisation holding a &#x27;controlling stake&#x27; in a company (a holding of over 51% of the stock) is in effect the de facto parent company of the firm, having overriding material influence over the held company&#x27;s operations, even if no formal full takeover has been enacted. Once a full takeover or purchase is enacted, the held company is seen to have ceased to operate as an independent entity but to have become a tending subsidiary of the purchasing company, which, in turn, becomes the parent company of the subsidiary. (A holding below 50% could be sufficient to give a parent company material influence if they are the largest individual shareholder or if they are placed in control of the running of the operation by non-operational shareholders.)

====Company law====
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;holding company&quot; is defined by the Companies Act 2006 at section 1159. It defines a holding company as a company that holds a majority of the voting rights in another company, &quot;or&quot; is a member of another company and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, &quot;or&quot; is a member of another company and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other members, a majority of the voting rights in that company.

===United States===

====Banking====

After the financial crisis of 2007–2008, many U.S. investment banks converted to holding companies. According to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&#x27;s website, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs were the five largest bank holding companies in the finance sector, , based on total assets.

====Utilities====
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 caused many energy companies to divest their subsidiary businesses. Between 1938 and 1958 the number of holding companies declined from 216 to 18. An energy law passed in 2005 removed the 1935 requirements, and has led to mergers and holding company formation among power marketing and power brokering companies.

====Broadcasting====

In US broadcasting, many major media conglomerates have purchased smaller broadcasters outright, but have not changed the broadcast licenses to reflect this, resulting in stations that are (for example) still licensed to Jacor and Citicasters, effectively making them such as subsidiary companies of their owner iHeartMedia. This is sometimes done on a per-market basis. For example, in Atlanta both WNNX and later WWWQ are licensed to &quot;WNNX LiCo, Inc.&quot; (LiCo meaning &quot;license company&quot;), both owned by Susquehanna Radio (which was later sold to Cumulus Media). In determining caps to prevent excessive concentration of media ownership, all of these are attributed to the parent company, as are leased stations, as a matter of broadcast regulation.

====Personal holding company====
In the United States, a personal holding company is defined in section 542 of the Internal Revenue Code. A corporation is a personal holding company if both of the following requirements are met:
* Gross income test: at least 60% of the corporation&#x27;s adjusted ordinary gross income is from dividends, interest, rent, and royalties.
* Stock ownership test: more than 50% in value of the corporation&#x27;s outstanding stock is owned by five or fewer individuals.

==Parent company==
A parent company is a company that owns enough voting power in another firm (or &quot;subsidiary&quot;)
to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors. The definition of a parent company differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.

When an existing company establishes a new company and keeps majority shares with itself, and invites other companies to buy minority shares, it is called a parent company. A parent company could simply be a company that wholly owns another company, which is then known as a &quot;wholly owned subsidiary&quot;.

<text>A shareholder (in the United States often referred to as stockholder) of corporate stock refers to an individual or legal entity (such as another corporation, a body politic, a trust or partnership) that is registered by the corporation as the legal owner of shares of the share capital of a public or private corporation. Shareholders may be referred to as members of a corporation. A person or legal entity becomes a shareholder in a corporation when their name and other details are entered in the corporation&#x27;s register of shareholders or members, and unless required by law the corporation is not required or permitted to enquire as to the beneficial ownership of the shares. A corporation generally cannot own shares of itself.

The influence of shareholders on the business is determined by the shareholding percentage owned. Shareholders of corporations are legally separate from the corporation itself. They are generally not liable for the corporation&#x27;s debts, and the shareholders&#x27; liability for company debts is said to be limited to the unpaid share price unless a shareholder has offered guarantees. The corporation is not required to record the beneficial ownership of a shareholding, only the owner as recorded on the register. When more than one person is on the record as owners of a shareholding, the first one on the record is taken to control the shareholding, and all correspondence and communication by the company will be with that person.

Shareholders may have acquired their shares in the primary market by subscribing to the IPOs and thus provided capital to the corporation. However, most shareholders acquire shares in the secondary market and provided no capital directly to the corporation. Shareholders may be granted special privileges depending on a share class. The board of directors of a corporation generally governs a corporation for the benefit of shareholders.

Shareholders are considered by some to be a subset of stakeholders, which may include anyone who has a direct or indirect interest in the business entity. For example, employees, suppliers, customers, the community, etc., are typically considered stakeholders because they contribute value or are impacted by the corporation.

== Types ==
A beneficial shareholder is the person or legal entity that has the economic benefit of ownership of the shares, while a nominee shareholder is the person or entity that is on the corporation&#x27;s register of members as the owner while being in reality that person acts for the benefit or at the direction of the beneficial owner, whether disclosed or not.

Primarily, there are two types of shareholders.

=== Ordinary shareholders ===
An individual or legal entity that owns ordinary shares of a company (in the United States commonly referred as common stock) is usually referred to as an ordinary shareholder. This type of shareholding is the most common. Ordinary shareholders have the right to influence decisions concerning the company by participating at general meetings of the company and in the election of directors and can file class action lawsuits, when warranted.

=== Preference shareholders ===
Preference shareholders are owners of preference shares (in the United States commonly referred as preferred stock). They are paid a fixed rate of dividend, which is paid in priority to the dividend to be paid to the ordinary shareholders. Preference shareholders usually do not have voting rights in the company.

== Rights ==
Subject to the applicable laws, the rules of the corporation and any shareholders&#x27; agreement, shareholders may have the right:
* To sell their shares.
* To vote on the directors nominated by the board of directors.
* To nominate directors (although this is very difficult in practice because of minority protections) and propose shareholder resolutions.
* To vote on mergers and changes to the corporate charter.
* To dividends if they are declared.
* To access certain information; for publicly traded companies, this information is normally publicly available.
* To sue the company for violation of fiduciary duty.
* To purchase new shares issued by the company.
* To vote on &amp; file shareholder resolutions.
* To vote on management compensation (say on pay).
* To vote on management proposals.
* To what assets remain after a liquidation.

The above-mentioned rights can be generally classified into (1) cash-flow rights and (2) voting rights. While the value of shares is mainly driven by the cash-flow rights that they carry (&quot;cash is king&quot;), voting rights can also be valuable. The value of shareholders&#x27; cash-flow rights can be computed by discounting future free cash flows. The value of shareholders&#x27; voting rights can be computed by four methods:
* The difference between voting shares and non-voting shares (dual-class approach).
* The difference between the price paid in a block-trade transaction and the subsequent price paid in a smaller transaction on exchanges (block-trade approach).
* The implied voting value obtained from option prices.
* The excess lending fee over voting events.

<doc id="146084" wikidata="Q295697" url="?curid=146084" title="ANFO">
<text>ANFO ( ) (or AN/FO, for ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) is a widely used bulk industrial high explosive. It consists of 94% porous prilled ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) (AN), which acts as the oxidizing agent and absorbent for the fuel, and 6% number 2 fuel oil (FO). The use of ANFO originated in the 1950s.

It has found wide use in coal mining, quarrying, metal ore mining, and civil construction in applications where its low cost and ease of use may outweigh the benefits of other explosives, such as water resistance, oxygen balance, higher detonation velocity, or performance in small-diameter columns. The mining industry accounts for an estimated 90% of the more than of explosives used annually in the United States. ANFO is also widely used in avalanche hazard mitigation.

== Chemistry ==

The chemistry of ANFO detonation is the reaction of ammonium nitrate with a long-chain alkane (CnH2n+2) to form nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and steam. In an ideal stoichiometrically balanced reaction, ANFO is composed of about 94.5% AN and 5.5% FO by weight. In practice, a slight excess of fuel oil is added, as underdosing results in reduced performance while overdosing merely results in more post-blast fumes. When detonation conditions are optimal, the gases are the only products. In practical use, such conditions are impossible to attain, and blasts produce moderate amounts of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

The fuel component of ANFO is typically diesel, but kerosene, coal dust, racing fuel, or even molasses have been used instead. Finely powdered aluminium in the mixture will sensitise it to detonate more readily.

=== Explosive properties ===
ANFO is highly insensitive, making it a tertiary explosive (or a &quot;blasting agent&quot;). Without a sensitizer, it cannot be detonated by a typical (such as No. 8) blasting cap with the small amount of primary explosives within. A larger quantity of secondary explosive, known as a primer or a booster, must be used. One or two sticks of dynamite were historically used; current practice is to use Tovex or cast boosters of pentolite (TNT/PETN or similar compositions).

ANFO is technically a high explosive in that it decomposes through detonation rather than deflagration at a velocity higher than the speed of sound in the material, but the low sensitivity means that it is not generally regulated as such. ANFO has a moderate velocity compared to other industrial explosives, measuring 3,200 m/s in diameter, unconfined, at ambient temperature. It is described as a &quot;non-ideal high explosive&quot;, as its explosive velocity is far from the thermodynamic ideal due to its porosity and the phase separation of its two components.

== Industrial use ==
In the mining industry, the term ANFO specifically describes a mixture of solid ammonium nitrate prills and diesel fuel. Other explosives based on the ANFO chemistry exist; the most commonly used are emulsions. They differ from ANFO in the physical form the reactants take. The most notable properties of emulsions are water resistance and higher bulk density.

While the density of pure crystalline ammonium nitrate is 1700 kg/m3, individual prills of explosive-grade AN measure approximately 1300 kg/m3. Their lower density is due to the presence of a small spherical air pocket within each prill: this is the primary difference between AN sold for blasting and that sold for agricultural use. These voids are necessary to sensitize ANFO: they create so-called &quot;hot spots&quot;. Finely powdered aluminium can be added to ANFO to increase both sensitivity and energy; in commercial usages however, this has fallen out of favor due to cost.

ANFO has a bulk density of about 840 kg/m3. In surface mining applications, it is typically loaded into boreholes by dedicated trucks that mix the AN and FO components immediately before the product is dispensed. In underground mining applications, ANFO is typically blow-loaded.

AN is highly hygroscopic, readily absorbing water from air. In humid environments, absorbed water interferes with its explosive function. AN is fully water-soluble; as such, it cannot be loaded into boreholes that contain standing water. When used in wet mining conditions, considerable effort must be taken to remove standing water and install a liner in the borehole; it is generally more productive to instead use a water-resistant explosive such as emulsion.

== Regulation ==

In most jurisdictions, ammonium nitrate doesn&#x27;t need to be classified as an explosive for transport purposes; it is merely an oxidizer. Mines typically prepare ANFO on-site using the same diesel fuel that powers their vehicles. While many fuels can theoretically be used, the low volatility and cost of diesel make it ideal.

ANFO under most conditions is detonator-insensitive, so it is legally classified as a blasting agent (tertiary explosive) and not a high explosive.

Ammonium nitrate is widely used as a fertilizer in the agricultural industry. It is also found in instant cold packs. In many countries, its purchase and use are restricted to buyers who have obtained the proper license.

== Disasters ==
Unmixed ammonium nitrate can decompose explosively, and has been responsible for several industrial disasters, including the following:

* 1921 Oppau explosion in Germany
* 1947 Texas City disaster in Texas City, Texas
* 2004 Ryongchon disaster in North Korea
* 2011 Norway attacks in Oslo, Norway
* 2013 West Fertilizer Company explosion in West, Texas
* 2015 Tianjin explosions
* 2020 Beirut explosion

Environmental hazards include eutrophication in confined waters and nitrate/gas oil contamination of ground or surface water.

== Paramilitary use ==

ANFO was used in 1970 when protests by students became violent at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who learned how to make and use ANFO from a Wisconsin Conservation Department booklet entitled &quot;Pothole Blasting for Wildlife&quot;, resulting in the Sterling Hall bombing.

ANFO used to be widely used by the FLNC (National Liberation Front of Corsica), along with f15 explosive. Five containers of each were used to blow up the Tax Office building in Bastia on 28 February 1987.

The ANFO car bomb was adopted by the Provisional IRA in 1972 and, by 1973, the Troubles were consuming of ammonium nitrate for the majority of bombs. The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) also made use of ANFO bombs, often mixing in gelignite as a booster, in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974 which killed 34 people &amp; injured almost 300, ANFO car bombs were used in Dublin. It has also seen use by groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and ETA. In 1992, Shining Path perpetrated the Tarata bombing in Lima, Peru, using two ANFO truck bombs.

A more sophisticated variant of ANFO (ammonium nitrate with nitromethane as the fuel, called ANNM) was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

The Shijiazhuang bombings rocked the city of Shijiazhuang, China, on 16 March 2001. A total of 108 people were killed, and 38 others injured when, within a short time, several ANFO bombs exploded near four apartment buildings.

In November 2009, the government of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan imposed a ban on ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizers in the Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Swat, Chitral and Malakand districts (the former Malakand Division) following reports that those chemicals were used by militants to make explosives.

In April 2010, police in Greece confiscated 180 kg of ANFO and other related material stashed in a hideaway in the Athens suburb of Kareas. The material was believed to be linked to attacks previously carried out by the &quot;Revolutionary Struggle&quot; terrorist group.

In January 2010, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan also issued a decree banning the use, production, storage, purchase, or sale of ammonium nitrate, after an investigation showed militants in the Taliban insurgency had used the substance in bomb attacks.

On 22 July 2011, an aluminium powder-enriched ANNM explosive, with total size of 950 kg (150 kg of aluminium powder), increasing demolition power by 10–30% over plain ANFO, was used in the Oslo bombing.

On 13 April 2016, two suspected IRA members were stopped in Dublin with 67 kg of ANFO.

On 6 March 2018, 8 members of the extreme right neo-Nazi group Combat 18 were arrested in Athens, Greece, accused of multiple attacks on immigrants and activists. They had 50 kg of ANFO in their possession.

<doc id="146086" wikidata="Q36835" url="?curid=146086" title="Vandalic language">
<text>Vandalic was the Germanic language spoken by the Vandals during roughly the 3rd to 6th centuries. It was probably closely related to Gothic, and, as such, is traditionally classified as an East Germanic language. Its attestation is very fragmentary, mainly due to the Vandals&#x27; constant migrations and late adoption of writing. All modern sources from the time when Vandalic was spoken are protohistoric.

== Classification ==
Vandalic is traditionally classified as an East Germanic language, while the reasons for this classification are mostly historical and not linguistical. Due to the perception of Vandalic as an East Germanic language, its reconstruction from onomastics recorded by Greek and Roman sources relies on Gothic forms. Therefore, it is difficult to assess whether or not Vandalic is closely related to Gothic.

Theories range from Gothic and Vandalic, together with Burgundian, form a dialect continuum, or that language of the Vandals was actually Gothic, to them being different languages separating early on, without having an intermediary East Germanic ancestor.

==History==

According to their own mythology, the Goths originally came from Scandinavia. It is therefore debated, whether Gothic and by extension Vandalic, came from Scandinavia or not. Linguistic evidence shows no specific relation between North Germanic and either Gothic or Vandalic. Still, it is possible that both the Goths and the Vandals migrated from Scandinavia southwards, where their respective languages started to diverge from Proto-Germanic.

The linguistic urheimat of Vandalic probably lies south of the Baltic sea. They crossed the Rhine in the fifth century, establishing themselves together with the Hasdingi and the Silingi in Gallaecia (northern Portugal and Galicia) and in southern Spain, following other Germanic and non-Germanic peoples (Visigoths, Alans and Suebi) in c. 410 before they moved to North Africa in the 430s. Their kingdom flourished in the early 6th century, but after their defeat in 534 they were placed under Byzantine administration. The Vandalic language is presumed to still have been spoken at the time of the Byzantine conquest. It likely disappeared before the end of the century.

==Attestation==
Very little is known about the Vandalic language other than various phrases and a small number of personal names of Vandalic origin, mainly known from documents and coins. Most Vandalic names were recorded by native speakers of Latin or Greek, who might have misinterpreted phonemes or assimilated names to those common in their mother tongue.

The regional name Andalusia is traditionally believed to have derived from Vandalic, although this claim is contested. Following the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, from the 8th century to the end of the 15th the region was called .

In one inscription from the Vandal Kingdom, the Christian incantation of is given in Vandalic as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Lord, have mercy!&quot;). The same phrase appears in 15 by Pseudo-Augustine: &quot;&quot;. It is possible that this sentence is, in fact, Gothic since the Vandals might have used Gothic as liturgical language.

The epigram in the Latin Anthology, of North African origin and disputed date, contains a fragment in a Germanic language that some authors believe to be Vandalic, although the fragment itself refers to the language as &quot;Gothic&quot;. This may be because both languages were East Germanic and closely related; scholars have pointed out in this context that Procopius refers to the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepids as &quot;Gothic nations&quot; and opines that they &quot;are all of the Arian faith, and have one language called Gothic&quot;. The fragment reads:

Other surviving Vandalic words are , &quot;master&quot; and , &quot;King of the Vandals&quot;.

== Phonology ==
The phonological features of Vandalic are similar to those of Gothic.

===Vowels===
The following vowel inventory is based on Wrede:

* Vandalic was sometimes written by Latin authors.

The Proto-Germanic long vowel * is often written in Vandalic names as (, ), but it is also represented as , .

The Proto-Germanic short vowel * is often written as in Vandalic when it was not preceded by *. For example, contains -&quot;i&quot; because &quot;g&quot; precedes the vowel, but retains the *e since &quot;r&quot; precedes the vowel. It could either mean that * turned into in Vandalic or that the Vandalic short was interpreted as by non-natives.

Similar to Gothic, Vandalic does not seem to have i-umlaut. One example of items that demonstrate the lack of umlaut are names that contain the form * (&lt; Proto-Germanic &#x27;army&#x27;): , , , vs. Old English , the latter of which does show umlaut with the Proto-Germanic *&quot;a&quot; having shifted to &quot;e&quot;.

Proto-Germanic * is written ; (compare Proto-Germanic ), . This could either mean that * turned into in Vandalic or that it is a misinterpretation of the sound by Latin authors. In Gothic documents, * is mostly written , but sometimes also .

The Proto-Germanic diphthong *eu tends to come down to Vandalic as &quot;eu&quot;. Take for example the form - (&#x27;people&#x27;), as opposed to the Gothic (), where it has changed to .

The Proto-Germanic diphthong *ai is preserved as , but tends to become later on. For example, the name changes to in later documents.

===Consonants===
The Vandalic consonant inventory according to Wrede.

* It is unclear how was originally pronounced.
* It is likely that [] occurred in Vandalic, but there is not enough evidence for the sound.

The Proto-Germanic * is also preserved in the language as a sibilant (always found written or as part of ), as opposed to having undergone rhotacism as it has in North or West Germanic. For example, compare the Vandalic form (as in ) &#x27;spear&#x27; to Old English .

The word-initial inherited from Proto-Germanic does not consistently appear in Vandalic names recorded by Greek or Latin authors (e.g., the element in and , from Proto-Germanic &#x27;army&#x27;). Sometimes the same name appears with and without , depending on the author. However, royal names on Vandal coins use a conservative official spelling, with the always being written. This could point to either a loss of the sound represented by or errors introduced by authors unfamiliar with the sound.

The Proto-Germanic fricatives * and * often turned into or , but there are also some names in which they were retained or otherwise represented distinctly: , .

Initial is sometimes written as . This could be an issue of Latin spelling or a point to the development of . Examples are , &lt; Proto-Germanic and , &lt; .

The Proto-Germanic cluster * can be found strengthened to .

The Proto-Germanic cluster * can become , as in from Proto-Germanic .

== Grammar ==
Very little is known about Vandalic grammar, but some things can be extracted from extant Vandalic material.

=== Morphology ===
The original Proto-Germanic &quot;*-z&quot; used to mark the nominative masculine singular in nominals, which was lost in West Germanic early on, is attested within some preserved Vandalic forms as -&quot;s&quot; or as part of -&quot;x&quot; (occasionally found Romanized in some name attestations as &quot;-us&quot;). This marker is potentially to be deemed an archaic feature since it is lost in most words, with complete lost within Ostrogothic names from the 6th century onward.

The epithet &#x27;king of the Vandals&#x27; gives possible attestation of a genitive plural ending &quot;-e&quot; (cf. Gothic -ē), albeit written as within this form. Old Germanic languages outside of East Germanic have -&quot;a&quot; (as in Old English and Old Norse) or -&quot;o&quot; (as in Old Dutch or Old High German) as their equivalents of this ending instead; compare Old English against the potential Vandalic form *.

==Vocabulary==
The tables below show various Vandalic words, phrases and forms that survive in (or as) names and various Latin texts. The majority of these were taken from .

== Writing system ==
The few names on coins issued by the Vandalic kingdom were written in Latin script.

<doc id="146087" wikidata="Q2321290" url="?curid=146087" title="Desolation Row">
<text>&quot;Desolation Row&quot; is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was recorded on August 4, 1965, and released as the closing track of Dylan&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. The song has been noted for its length (11:21) and surreal lyrics in which Dylan weaves characters into a series of vignettes that suggest entropy and urban chaos.

== Recording ==
Although the album version of &quot;Desolation Row&quot; is acoustic, the song was initially recorded in an electric version. The first take was recorded during an evening session on July 29, 1965, with Harvey Brooks on electric bass and Al Kooper on electric guitar. This version was eventually released in 2005 on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot;.

On August 2, Dylan recorded five further takes of &quot;Desolation Row&quot;. The &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; version was recorded at an overdub session on August 4, 1965, in Columbia&#x27;s Studio A in New York City. Nashville-based guitarist Charlie McCoy, who happened to be in New York, was invited by producer Bob Johnston to contribute an improvised acoustic guitar part and Russ Savakus played bass guitar. Author Mark Polizzotti credits some of the success of the song to McCoy&#x27;s contribution: &quot;While Dylan&#x27;s panoramic lyrics and hypnotic melody sketch out the vast canvas, it is McCoy&#x27;s fills that give it their shading.&quot; Outtakes from the August sessions were released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966&quot; in 2015.

== Interpretation ==
When asked where &quot;Desolation Row&quot; was located, at a TV press conference in San Francisco on December 3, 1965, Dylan replied: &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s some place in Mexico, it&#x27;s across the border. It&#x27;s noted for its Coke factory.&quot; Al Kooper, who played electric guitar on the first recordings of &quot;Desolation Row&quot;, suggested that it was located on a stretch of Eighth Avenue, Manhattan, &quot;an area infested with whore houses, sleazy bars and porno supermarkets totally beyond renovation or redemption&quot;. Polizzotti suggests that both the inspiration and title of the song may have come from &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; by Jack Kerouac and &quot;Cannery Row&quot; by John Steinbeck.

When Jann Wenner asked Dylan in 1969 whether Allen Ginsberg had influenced his songs, Dylan replied: &quot;I think he did at a certain period. That period of... &#x27;Desolation Row,&#x27; that kind of New York type period, when all the songs were just city songs. His poetry is city poetry. Sounds like the city.&quot;

The southwestern flavored acoustic guitar backing and eclecticism of the imagery led Polizzotti to describe &quot;Desolation Row&quot; as the &quot;ultimate cowboy song, the &#x27;Home On The Range&#x27; of the frightening territory that was mid-sixties America&quot;. In the penultimate verse the passengers on the &quot;Titanic&quot; are &quot;shouting &#x27;Which Side Are You On?&#x27;&quot;, a slogan of left-wing politics, so, for Robert Shelton, one of the targets of this song is &quot;simpleminded political commitment. What difference which side you&#x27;re on if you&#x27;re sailing on the &quot;Titanic&quot;?&quot; In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot; on September 10, 2001, the day before the release of his album &quot;Love and Theft&quot;, Dylan claimed that the song is &quot;a minstrel song through and through. I saw some ragtag minstrel show in blackface at the carnivals when I was growing up, and it had an effect on me, just as much as seeing the lady with four legs.&quot;

The song opens with a report that &quot;they&#x27;re selling postcards of the hanging&quot;, and notes &quot;the circus is in town&quot;. Polizzotti, and other critics, have connected this song with the lynching of three black men in Duluth. The men were employed by a traveling circus and had been accused of raping a white woman. On the night of June 15, 1920, they were removed from custody and hanged on the corner of First Street and Second Avenue East. Photo postcards of the lynchings were sold. Duluth was Bob Dylan&#x27;s birthplace. Dylan&#x27;s father, Abram Zimmerman, was eight years old at the time of the lynchings, and lived two blocks from the scene. Abram Zimmerman passed the story on to his son.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Desolation Row&quot; has been described as Dylan&#x27;s most ambitious work up to that date. In the &quot;New Oxford Companion to Music&quot;, Gammond described &quot;Desolation Row&quot; as an example of Dylan&#x27;s work that achieved a &quot;high level of poetical lyricism.&quot; Clinton Heylin notes that Dylan is writing a song as long as traditional folk ballads, such as &quot;Tam Lin&quot; and &quot;Matty Groves&quot;, and in that classic ballad metre, but without any linear narrative thread.

When he reviewed the &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; album for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1965, the English poet Philip Larkin described the song as a &quot;marathon&quot;, with an &quot;enchanting tune and mysterious, possibly half-baked words&quot;. For Andy Gill the song is &quot;an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Felliniesque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of iconic characters, some historical (Albert Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse.&quot;

According to the music historian Nicholas Schaffner, &quot;Desolation Row&quot; was the longest popular music track, until the Rolling Stones released &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; (11:35) in 1966.

In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Desolation Row&quot; at number 187 on their &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list; the song was re-ranked at number 83 in the 2021 revision of the list. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; ranked the song number five and number three, respectively, on their lists of the 50 greatest Bob Dylan songs.

Dylan played the Isle of Wight Festival 1969, and &quot;Desolation Row&quot; was the name given to the hillside area used by the 600,000 ticketless fans at the 1970 event, before the fence was torn down.

== Live performance ==
Dylan debuted &quot;Desolation Row&quot; at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Queens, New York, on August 28, 1965, after he &quot;controversially went electric&quot; at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. It was part of the acoustic set Dylan played before bringing on his electric band. Of the performance, music critic Robert Shelton stated that &quot;the song, another of Mr. Dylan&#x27;s musical Rorschachs capable of widely varied interpretation ... It can best be characterized as a &quot;folk song of the absurd.&quot; The displaced images and Kafkaesque cavalcade of historical characters were at first greeted with laughter.

Live versions are included on Dylan&#x27;s albums &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1995; recorded November 1994), &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot; (1998; recorded May 1966), &quot;The 1966 Live Recordings&quot; (2016 boxed set; multiple recording dates, with one concert released separately on the album &quot;The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert&quot;), and &quot;Live 1962–1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections&quot; (2018; recorded April 1966). The song has been featured in live performances as recently as November 19, 2012. The song is included on some set lists on Dylan&#x27;s current tour and was played in Bournemouth on May 4, 2017.

== Other renditions ==
=== My Chemical Romance ===
My Chemical Romance recorded a cover of &quot;Desolation Row&quot; for the 2009 soundtrack of the film &quot;Watchmen&quot;. The song peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks in March 2009. The first chapter of the comic on which the film is based (&quot;At Midnight All the Agents&quot;) takes its name from a line in the song. This line is also quoted at the end of the chapter.

The music video for My Chemical Romance&#x27;s version was directed by Zack Snyder, who also directed the &quot;Watchmen&quot; film and, as a result, features similar effects to that of the film, though no actual footage of the film appears. It features the band playing in an old-school punk arena, with visual similarities to the &quot;Pale Horse&quot; concert referenced in the graphic novel. The show is sold out yet more fans want in. A riot ensues as the band plays. The police arrive but are powerless to control the crowd in the venue and outside. A SWAT team arrives, arrests the band, and disperses the rioters.

During MCR&#x27;s parts in the video multiple elements of &quot;Watchmen&quot; imagery (such as Rorschach&#x27;s mask and The Comedian&#x27;s smiley face button) are seen. The pink elephant balloon from both the comic and the film is also seen at the beginning of the video.

The band also are shown playing punk-esque instruments, covered in spray paint, warnings, etc. A Fender Stratocaster, Epiphone Les Paul and Fender Precision Bass respectively, All finished in black.

Also, the song marks the last music video appearance to feature Bob Bryar before his departure in 2010, although he would appear again on &quot;Conventional Weapons&quot; that was released three years later on February 5, 2013.

The Grateful Dead performed a version of &quot;Desolation Row&quot; from the mid-1980s onwards. The song is included on their 2002 release &quot;Postcards of the Hanging&quot;, the album name alluding to the lyrics of &quot;Desolation Row&quot;. The album features a recording from March 24, 1990, at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York. The song was frequently abbreviated in Dead set lists to &quot;D-Row.&quot;

Chris Smither recorded the song on his 2003 album &quot;Train Home&quot; with Bonnie Raitt providing backup on vocals and slide guitar. It has also been recorded by Robyn Hitchcock on the album &quot;Robyn Sings&quot;.

Old 97&#x27;s singer Rhett Miller borrowed &quot;Desolation Row&quot;&#x27;s melody for a new song, &quot;Champaign, Illinois&quot;. It was recorded with Dylan&#x27;s blessing and appears on Old 97&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;The Grande Theatre, Volume One&quot;, with Dylan and Miller sharing writing credit.

=== References in popular culture ===
Laura Branigan&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Spanish Eddie&quot; mentions the song in its chorus, &quot;&quot;The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in / they were playin&#x27; &quot;Desolation Row&quot; on the radio&quot; 

A line from the song &quot;At midnight, all the agents and the superhuman crew, go out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.&quot;&quot; is the closing quotation in chapter 1 of &quot;Watchmen&quot; by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. In a foreword for the collected editions of the series, Dave Gibbons claims &quot;it began with Bob Dylan&quot;, that the lyrics reproduced for chapter 1 were the &quot;spark that would one day ignite WATCHMEN.&quot;

The same line is evoked in Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 4th of July, Asbury Park as follows: &quot;&quot;Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie, for telling fortunes better than they do&quot;.

The title track of The War on Drugs&#x27; fifth album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; contains the lyrics, &quot;Like when we went to see Bob Dylan/ We danced to &quot;Desolation Row&quot;&quot;&quot;.

In the sixth part of &quot;Jojo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, &quot;Desolation Road&quot; is one of the 14 phrases that are uttered by antagonist Enrico Pucchi in order to activate the Green Baby and acquire the Stand C-Moon.

<doc id="146089" wikidata="Q242949" url="?curid=146089" title="Danica McKellar">
<text>Danica Mae McKellar (born January 3, 1975) is an American actress, mathematics writer, and education advocate. She is best known for playing Winnie Cooper in the television series &quot;The Wonder Years.&quot;

McKellar has appeared in various television films for the Hallmark Channel. She has also done voice acting, including Frieda Goren in &quot;Static Shock,&quot; Miss Martian in &quot;Young Justice,&quot; and Killer Frost in &quot;DC Super Hero Girls.&quot; In 2015, McKellar joined part of the main cast in the Netflix original series &quot;Project Mc2&quot;.

In addition to her acting work, McKellar later wrote seven non-fiction books, all dealing with mathematics: &quot;Math Doesn&#x27;t Suck&quot;, &quot;Kiss My Math&quot;, &quot;Hot X: Algebra Exposed&quot;, &quot;Girls Get Curves: Geometry Takes Shape&quot;, which encourage middle-school and high-school girls to have confidence and succeed in mathematics, &quot;Goodnight, Numbers&quot;, and &quot;Do Not Open This Math Book&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
McKellar was born in La Jolla, California. She moved with her family to Los Angeles when she was eight. Her mother, Mahaila McKellar (née Tello), was a homemaker; her father, Christopher McKellar, is a real estate developer; her younger sister, Crystal (b. 1976), is a lawyer. She is of Scottish, French, German, Spanish, and Dutch descent on her father’s side, and of Portuguese descent, by way of the Azores and the Madeira islands, on her mother’s side.

In 1998, McKellar earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics (&quot;summa cum laude&quot;) from UCLA, where she was a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority. As an undergraduate, she coauthored a scientific paper with Professor Lincoln Chayes and fellow student Brandy Winn titled &quot;Percolation and Gibbs states multiplicity for ferromagnetic Ashkin–Teller models on formula_1.&quot; Their results are termed the &quot;Chayes–McKellar–Winn theorem&quot;. Later, when Chayes was asked to comment about the mathematical abilities of his student coauthors, he was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I thought that the two were really, really first-rate.&quot; As a result of her past collaborative work on research papers, McKellar is currently assigned the Erdős number four, and the Erdős–Bacon number six.

== Acting career ==
=== &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and early acting career ===
At age seven, McKellar enrolled in weekend acting classes for children at the Lee Strasberg Institute in Los Angeles. In her teens, she landed a prominent role in &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, an American television comedy-drama that ran for six seasons on ABC, from 1988 to 1993. She played Gwendolyn &quot;Winnie&quot; Cooper, the main love interest of Kevin Arnold (played by Fred Savage) on the show. Her first kiss was with Fred Savage in an episode of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. She later said, &quot;My first kiss was a pretty nerve-wracking experience! But we never kissed off screen, and pretty quickly our feelings turned into brother/sister, and stayed that way.&quot;

=== Later acting career ===

McKellar has said that she found it &quot;difficult&quot; to move from being a child actress to an adult actress. Since leaving &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, McKellar has had several guest roles in television series (including one with former co-star Fred Savage on &quot;Working&quot;), and has written and directed two short films. She appeared in two Lifetime films in the &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; series, playing Kristin Guthrie in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Cradle of Conspiracy&quot; and Annie Mills Carman in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Justice for Annie.&quot; She briefly returned to regular television with a recurring role in the 2002–03 season of &quot;The West Wing,&quot; portraying Elsie Snuffin, the half-sister and assistant of Deputy White House Communications Director Will Bailey.

McKellar was featured in the video for Debbie Gibson&#x27;s eighth single from the &quot;Electric Youth&quot; album, &quot;No More Rhyme&quot;, which was released in 1989. She plays the cello in the beginning of the video.

McKellar appeared in lingerie in the July 2005 edition of &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine after readers voted her the 1990s star they would most like to see in lingerie. McKellar explained that she agreed to the shoot in part to obtain &quot;grittier roles&quot;.

In 2006, McKellar starred in a Lifetime film and web-based series titled &quot;Inspector Mom&quot; about a mother who solves mysteries.

On the August 1, 2007, edition of the &quot;Don and Mike Show&quot;, a WJFK-FM radio program out of Washington, D.C., McKellar announced that the producers of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; were planning to bring her back for a recurring role (she guest-starred on the show in late 2005 in &quot;The Pineapple Incident&quot; and again in early 2007 in &quot;Third Wheel&quot;). She also made an appearance on the show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Psychic Vortex&quot;.

In 2008, she starred in &quot;Heatstroke&quot;, a Sci-Fi Channel film about searching for alien life on Earth and in 2009 she was one of the stars commenting on the occurrences of the new millennium in VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the New Millennium&quot; and was the math correspondent for &quot;Brink&quot;, a program by the Science Channel about technology. In 2013, she played Ellen Plainview in Lifetime&#x27;s reimagining of the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Wrong Man.&quot;

McKellar has also worked as a voice actress, having provided the voice of Jubilee in the video game &quot;X-Men Legends&quot; (2004), and Invisible Woman in &quot;&quot; (2006) and &quot;&quot; (2009). She provided the voice of Miss Martian in the TV series &quot;Young Justice&quot;.

In 2012, she starred in the Lifetime film &quot;Love at the Christmas Table&quot; with Dustin Milligan.

In January 2013, she starred in the Syfy film &quot;Tasmanian Devils&quot; with Apolo Ohno.

On August 20, 2013, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne released the music video for her single &quot;Rock N Roll&quot; from her self-titled fifth album, which features McKellar as &quot;Winnie Cooper&quot;.

On March 4, 2014, she was announced to be competing on season 18 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She paired with Valentin Chmerkovskiy. McKellar and Chmerkovskiy were eliminated on Week 8, finishing in 6th place.

She had a guest appearance in the &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot; season four episode six titled &quot;The Blunder Years&quot;. She made another guest appearance in the season seven episode ten titled &quot;Speech Impediment&quot;.

In 2015, she starred in the Netflix original series &quot;Project Mc2&quot; as The Quail.

She has starred in several Hallmark Channel films, including &quot;Crown for Christmas&quot;, &quot;My Christmas Dream&quot;, &quot;Campfire Kiss&quot;, &quot;Love and Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Christmas at Dollywood&quot;, and &quot;You, Me &amp; the Christmas Trees&quot; as well as the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries series &quot;The Matchmaker Mysteries&quot;.

McKellar is a judge on Fox’s &quot;Domino Masters&quot; which premiered on March 9, 2022.

== Books ==
McKellar has authored several mathematics-related books primarily targeting adolescent readers interested in succeeding at the study of mathematics:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

Her first book, &quot;Math Doesn&#x27;t Suck: How to Survive Middle School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and was favorably reviewed by Tara C. Smith, the founder of Iowa Citizens for Science and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa. The book also received a review from Anthony Jones, writing for the &quot;School Librarian&quot; journal, who described the book as &quot;a trouble-shooting guide to help girls overcome their biggest maths challenges,&quot; noting what he described as &quot;real-world examples of great mathematics in action.&quot; In an interview with Smith, McKellar said that she wrote the book &quot;to show girls that math is accessible and relevant, and even a little glamorous&quot; and to counteract &quot;damaging social messages telling young girls that math and science aren&#x27;t for them&quot;.

McKellar&#x27;s second book, &quot;Kiss My Math: Showing Pre-Algebra Who&#x27;s Boss&quot;, was released on August 5, 2008. The book&#x27;s target audience is girls in the 7th through 9th grades. Her third book, &quot;Hot X: Algebra Exposed!&quot; covers algebra topics, while the previous two titles were intended as &quot;algebra-readiness books.&quot; &quot;Hot X&quot; was published on August 3, 2010. Her fourth book, &quot;Girls Get Curves – Geometry Takes Shape&quot;, focuses on the subject of geometry, and attempts to make the subject more accessible.

Three of McKellar&#x27;s books were listed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; children&#x27;s bestseller list. She received Mathical Honors for &quot;Goodnight, Numbers&quot;.

The news segment highlighted her book &quot;Math Doesn&#x27;t Suck&quot; and her efforts to help girls develop an interest in mathematics, especially during the middle school years. In January 2014, she received the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics (JPBM) Communications Award. The citation credited her books, blog, and public appearances for encouraging &quot;countless middle and high school students, especially girls, to be more interested in mathematics.&quot;

== Personal life ==
McKellar married composer Mike Verta on March 22, 2009, in La Jolla, California; the couple had dated since 2001. They had their first child, a son, in 2010. McKellar filed for divorce from Verta in June 2012.

On July 16, 2014, she became engaged to her boyfriend Scott Sveslosky, a partner in the Los Angeles legal firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton. On November 15, 2014, they married in Kauai, Hawaii.

McKellar is a Christian and regularly attends church services. She cites Candace Cameron Bure as having been a major influence in her life after Bure gave her a copy of the Bible.

<doc id="146091" wikidata="Q3954" url="?curid=146091" title="Neptune (mythology)">
<text>Neptune ( ) is the god of freshwater and the sea in the Roman religion. He is the counterpart of the Greek god Poseidon. In the Greek-inspired tradition, he is a brother of Jupiter and Pluto, with whom he presides over the realms of heaven, the earthly world (including the underworld), and the seas. Salacia is his wife.

Depictions of Neptune in Roman mosaics, especially those in North Africa, were influenced by Hellenistic conventions. He was likely associated with freshwater springs before the sea; his festival, &quot;Neptunalia&quot;, took place on July 23, during the peak of summer when water was scarcest. Like Poseidon, he was also worshipped by the Romans as a god of horses, &quot;Neptunus equestris,&quot; who was also a patron of horse-racing.

==Worship==



The theology of Neptune is limited by his close identification with the Greek god Poseidon, one of many members of the Greek pantheon whose theology was later tied to a Roman deity. The &quot;lectisternium&quot; of 399 BC indicated that the Greek figures of Poseidon, Artemis, and Heracles had been introduced and worshipped in Rome as Neptune, Diana, and Hercules. It has been speculated that Neptune has been conflated with a Proto-Indo-European freshwater deity; since the Indo-Europeans lived inland and had little direct knowledge of the sea, the Romans may have reused the theology of a previous freshwater god in their worship of Neptune. Servius explicitly names Neptune as the god of rivers, springs, and waters; he may parallel the Irish god Nechtan, master of rivers and wells. This is in contrast to Poseidon, who was primarily a god of the sea.

Neptune has been associated with a number of other Roman deities. By the first century BC, he had supplanted Portunus as the god of naval victories; Sextus Pompeius called himself the &quot;son of Neptune&quot;. For a time, Neptune was paired in his dominion of the sea with Salacia, the goddess of saltwater. Neptune was considered the legendary progenitor god of the Falisci (who called themselves &quot;Neptunia proles&quot;), joining Mars, Janus, Saturn, and Jupiter as the deific father of a Latin tribe. 

===Neptunalia===
Neptunalia, the Roman festival of Neptune, was held at the height of summer (typically on July 23). The date of the festival and the construction of tree-branch shelters suggest that Neptune was a god of water sources in times of drought and heat. The most ancient Roman calendar set the &quot;feriae&quot; of Neptunus on July 23, between the Lucaria festival of the grove and the Furrinalia festival of July 25. All three festivals were connected to water during the period of summer heat (&quot;canicula&quot;) and drought, when freshwater sources were lowest.

It has been speculated that the three festivals fall in a logical order. The &quot;Lucaria&quot; was devoted to clearing overgrown bushes and uprooting and burning excess vegetation. Neptunalia followed, devoted to conservation and the draining of superficial waters. These culminated in the &quot;Furrinalia&quot;, sacred to Furrina (the goddess of springs and wells).

Neptunalia was spent under branch huts in a woods between the Tiber and the Via Salaria, with participants drinking spring water and wine to escape the heat. It was a time of merrymaking, when men and women could mix without the usual Roman societal constraints. There is an added context of agricultural fertility in the festival, since Neptune received the sacrifice of a bull.

===Temples===
Neptune had only one temple in Rome. It stood near the Circus Flaminius, the Roman racetrack in the southern part of the Campus Martius, and dates back to at least 206 BC. The temple was restored out by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus , an event depicted on a coin struck by the consul. Within the temple was a sculpture of a marine group by Scopas Minor. The Basilica Neptuni was later built on the Campus Martius, and was dedicated by Agrippa in honor of the naval victory of Actium. This basilica supplanted the older temple, which had replaced an ancient altar.

===Sacrifices===
Neptune is one of only four Roman gods to whom it was considered appropriate to sacrifice a bull. The other three were Apollo, Mars, and Jupiter, although Vulcan has also been depicted with the offering of a red bull and a red-bull calf. If an incorrect offering was presented, either inadvertently or due to necessity, additional propitiation was required to avoid divine retribution. This type of offering implied a stricter connection between the deity and the world.

===Paredrae===
&quot;Paredrae&quot; are entities who accompany a god, representing the fundamental aspects (or powers) of that god. With Hellenic influence, these &quot;paredrae&quot; came to be considered separate deities and consorts of their associated god. Earlier folk belief might have also identified &quot;paredrae&quot; as consorts of their god.

Salacia and Venilia have been discussed by ancient and modern scholars. Varro connects Salacia to &quot;salum&quot; (sea), and Venilia to &quot;ventus&quot; (wind). Festus attributed to Salacia the motion of the sea. Venilia brought waves to the shore, and Salacia caused their retreat out to sea. They were examined by the Christian philosopher St. Augustine, who devoted a chapter of &quot;De Civitate Dei&quot; to ridiculing inconsistencies in the theological definition of the entities; since Salacia personified the deep sea, Augustine wondered how she could also be the retreating waves (since waves are a surface phenomenon). He wrote elsewhere that Venilia would be the &quot;hope that comes&quot;, an aspect (or power) of Jupiter understood as &quot;anima mundi&quot;.

Servius, in his commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, wrote about Salacia and Venilia in V 724: &quot;(Venus) dicitur et Salacia, quae proprie meretricum dea appellata est a veteribus&quot;; &quot;(Venus) is also called Salacia, who was particularly named goddess of prostitutes by the ancient&quot;. Elsewhere, he wrote that Salacia and Venilia are the same entity.

Among modern scholars, Dumézil and his followers Bloch and Schilling centre their interpretation of Neptune on the direct, concrete, limited value and functions of water. Salacia would represent the forceful, violent aspect of gushing and overflowing water and Venilia the tranquil, gentle aspect of still (or slowly-flowing) water. According to Dumézil, Neptune&#x27;s two &quot;paredrae&quot; (Salacia and Venilia) represent the overpowering and tranquil aspects of water, natural and domesticated: Salacia the gushing, overbearing waters, and Venilia the still (or quietly-flowing) waters.

Preller, Fowler, Petersmann and Takács attribute to the theology of Neptune broader significance as a god of universal worldly fertility, particularly relevant to agriculture and human reproduction. They interpret Salacia as personifying lust, and Venilia as related to &quot;venia&quot;: ingratiating attraction, connected with love and the desire for reproduction. Ludwig Preller cited a significant aspect of Venilia; she was recorded in the &quot;indigitamenta&quot; as a deity of longing or desire. According to Preller, this would explain a theonym similar to that of Venus. Other data seem to agree; Salacia would parallel Thetis as the mother of Achilles, and Venilia would be the mother of Turnus and Iuturna by Daunus (king of the Rutulians). According to another source, Venilia would be the partner of Janus, with whom she mothered the nymph Canens (loved by Picus). These mythical data underline the reproductive function envisaged in the figures of Neptune&#x27;s &quot;paredrae&quot;, particularly that of Venilia, in childbirth and motherhood. A legendary king Venulus was remembered at Tibur and Lavinium.

==Neptunus equestris==

Before Poseidon was known as the god of the sea, he was connected to the horse and may have originally been depicted in equine form. This connection reflects the violent and brutal nature of Poseidon the earth-shaker, the linkage of horses and springs, and the animal&#x27;s psychopompous character. Neptune, in contrast, has no such direct connection with horses. The Roman deity Consus was associated with the horse, and his underground altar was in the valley of the Circus Maximus at the foot of the Palatine (the site of horse races). On the summer Consualia (August 21) it was customary to bring horses and mules, crowned with flowers, in procession and then hold equine races in the Circus. The festival also traditionally reenacted the abduction of the Sabine (and Latin) women, reflecting the sexual license characteristic of such festivals. On that day, the Flamen Quirinalis and the Vestal Virgins made sacrifices on the underground altar of Consus. The proximity of the two Consualia to the Opiconsivia (the latter were four days later, the winter festival on December 19) indicates the relationship between the two deities pertaining to agriculture. According to Dumézil, the horse has a much-different symbolic value in the theologies of Poseidon and Consus. Tertullian (&quot;De Spectaculis&quot; V 7) wrote that according to Roman tradition, Consus was the god who advised Romulus on the abduction of the Sabines.

Perhaps influenced by Poseidon Ίππιος, Consus (whose festival included horse races) was reinterpreted as &quot;Neptunus equestris&quot;; for his underground altar, he was identified with Poseidon Ένοσίχθων. The etymology of &quot;Poseidon&quot;, derived from &quot;Posis&quot; (lord or husband) and &quot;De&quot; (grain or earth) may have contributed to the identification of Consus with Neptune. His arcane cult, which required the unearthing of the altar, indicate the deity&#x27;s antiquity and chthonic nature. From Augustine (&quot;De Civitate Dei&quot; IV 8, about the role of Tutilina in assuring the safety of stored grain), Dumézil interprets its name as deriving from &quot;condere&quot; (to hide or store) as a verbal noun similar to Sancus and Janus: the god of stored grains. A direct identification of Consus with Poseidon is hindered by the fact that Poseidon is nowhere worshipped at underground shrines or altars.

Martianus Capella places Neptune and Consus together in region X of Heaven, possibly following an old &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; of Consus or reflecting an Etruscan idea of a chthonic Neptune apparent in the recommendation of the &quot;De Haruspicum Responso&quot; for propitiating Neptune for the cracking sounds heard underground in the &quot;ager latiniensis&quot;. The Etruscans were also fond of horse races.

==Etruria==
The Etruscan name of Neptune is Nethuns. It had been believed that Neptune derived from Etruscan, but this view has been disputed. Nethuns was apparently important to the Etruscans. His name is found in two places on the Liver of Piacenza: on the outer rim of section seven, and on the gallbladder of section 28. This last location aligns with Pliny the Elder&#x27;s belief that the gallbladder was sacred to Neptune. The name &quot;Nethuns&quot; occurs eight times in columns VII, IX, and XI of the &quot;Liber Linteus&quot;.

On a mirror from Tuscania (E. S. 1. 76), Nethuns is represented talking to Uśil (the sun) and Thesan (the goddess of dawn). Nethuns is seated on the left, holding a double-ended trident in his right hand and with his left arm raised as if giving instructions. Uśil is standing in the centre, holding Aplu&#x27;s bow in his right hand. Thesan is on the right, with her right hand on Uśil&#x27;s shoulder; both are listening intently to Nethuns&#x27; words. The identification of Uśil with Aplu (and his association with Nethuns) is emphasised by an anguiped demon holding two dolphins on an exergue. The scene highlights the identities and association of Nethuns and Aplu (here identified as Uśil) as main deities of the worldly realm and the life cycle. Thesan and Uśil-Aplu, who has been identified with Śuri (Soranus Pater, the underworld sun god) clarify the transience of earthly life. 

Neptune is a god of fertility, including human fertility. According to Stephen Weinstock, Jupiter is present in each of the first three regions with different aspects related to each region; Neptune should have been in the second region, and Pluto in the third. The reason for Neptune&#x27;s displacement to region X is unclear. It is consistent with the collocation in the third quadrant of the deities related to the human world.

===Etruscan Penates===
Arnobius provides information about the theology of Neptune. Neptune and Apollo were considered Etruscan Penates, and the deities were credited with giving Ilium its walls. In another tradition based on the same source, the Etruscan Penates were Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the Latin &quot;Neptunus&quot; is unclear and disputed. The ancient grammarian Varro derived the name from &quot;nuptus&quot; (&quot;covering&quot;, &quot;opertio&quot;), alluding to &quot;nuptiae&quot; (&quot;the marriage of Heaven and Earth&quot;).

Among modern scholars, Paul Kretschmer proposed a derivation from the Indo-European &quot;*neptu-&quot; (&quot;moist substance&quot;). Raymond Bloch similarly theorised that it might be an adjectival form (&quot;-no&quot;) of &quot;*nuptu-&quot; (&quot;he who is moist&quot;).

Georges Dumézil said that words deriving from the root &quot;*nep-&quot; are not attested in Indo-European languages other than Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan. He proposed an etymology which joins &quot;Neptunus&quot; with the Indian and Iranian theonyms Apam Napat and Apam Napá and the Old Irish theonym Nechtan, all meaning &quot;descendant of the waters&quot;. Using a comparative approach, the Indo-Iranian, Avestan and Irish figures have common features with the Roman legends about Neptune. Dumézil proposed to derive the nouns from the Indo-European root &quot;népōts-&quot; (&quot;descendant, sister&#x27;s son&quot;). His former student, Indo-Europeanist Jaan Puhvel, theorises that the name might have meant &quot;child (&quot;neve&quot;, nephew) of the water&quot; as part of an Indo-European fire-in-water myth.

A different etymology, grounded in the legendary history of Latium and Etruria, was proposed by the 19th-century scholars Ludwig Preller, Karl Otfried Müller and Wilhelm Deeke. The name of the Etruscan deity Nethuns or Nethunus (&quot;NÈDVNVZ&quot;) would be an adjectival form of the toponym Nepe(t) or Nepete (present-day Nepi), near Falerii. The district was traditionally connected to the cult of Neptune, and Messapus and Halesus (the eponymous hero of Falerii) were believed to be his sons. Messapus led the Falisci (and others) to war in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Nepi and Falerii have been known since antiquity for the quality of their meadow springwater. &quot;Nepet&quot; might be considered a hydronymic toponym of pre-Indo-European origin from a noun meaning &quot;damp wide valley, plain&quot;, a cognate of the proto-Greek &quot;νάπη&quot; (&quot;wooded vale, chasm&quot;).

===Fertility deity and divine ancestor===

In lectures delivered during the 1990s, German scholar Hubert Petersmann proposed an etymology from the Indo-European root &quot;*nebh-&quot; (&quot;damp, wet&quot;) with the suffix &quot;-tu&quot; (for an abstract verbal noun) and the adjectival suffix &quot;-no&quot; (domain of activity). The root &quot;*nebh-&quot; gives the Sanskrit &quot;nābhah&quot;, Hittite &quot;nepis&quot;, Latin &quot;nubs&quot;, &quot;nebula&quot;, German &quot;Nebel&quot;, and the Slavic &quot;nebo&quot;. The concept would be close to that expressed in the name of the Greek god &quot;Όυράνος&quot; (&quot;Uranus&quot;), derived from the root &quot;*h2wórso-&quot; (&quot;to water or irrigate&quot;) and &quot;*h2worsó-&quot; (&quot;the irrigator&quot;). 

Petersmann proposes a different interpretation of Neptune&#x27;s theology. Developing his understanding of the theonym as rooted in the Indo-European &quot;*nebh&quot;, he writes that the god would be an ancient deity of the cloudy, rainy sky in company with (and in opposition to) Zeus/Jupiter, the god of clear skies. Similar to Caelus, he would be the father of all earthly things through the fertilising power of rain. The &quot;hieros gamos&quot; of Neptune and Earth is reflected in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; V 14 (&quot;pater Neptunus&quot;). Neptune&#x27;s power would be reflected by Salacia, one of his &quot;paredrae&quot;, who also denotes the overcast sky. His other &quot;paredra&quot;, Venilia, is associated with the wind as well as the sea. The theonym Venilia may be rooted in &quot;*venilis&quot;, a postulated adjective deriving from the IE root &quot;*ven(h)&quot; (&quot;to love or desire&quot;) in the Sanskrit &quot;vánati, vanóti&quot; (&quot;he loves&quot;), German &quot;Wonne&quot;, and the Latin Venus, &quot;venia&quot;. Neptune&#x27;s dual nature is found in Catullus 31. 3: &quot;uterque Neptunus&quot;.

According to Petersmann, the ancient Indo-Europeans also venerated a god of wetness as the generator of life; this is indicated by the Hittite theonyms &quot;nepišaš (D)IŠKURaš&quot; or &quot;nepišaš (D)Tarhunnaš&quot; (&quot;lord of sky wet&quot;), the sovereign of Earth and humanity. Although this function was transferred to Zeus/Jupiter (the sovereigns of weather), the old function survived in literature: the &quot;Aeneid&quot; V 13-14 reads, &quot;Heu, quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi?/ quidve, pater Neptune, paras?&quot; (&quot;What, why have so many clouds enringed the sky? What are you preparing, father Neptune?&quot;) The indispensability of water and its connection to reproduction are universally known.

Müller and Deeke interpreted Neptune&#x27;s theology as a divine ancestor of the Latin Faliscans: the father of Messapus and Halesus, their heroic founders. William Warde Fowler considered Salacia the personification of the virile potency which generated a Latin people, parallel with Mars, Saturn, Janus and Jupiter.

==Depictions in art==
Etruscan representations of Neptune are rare but significant. The oldest may be a fourth-century BC carved carnelian scarab from Vulci of Nethuns kicking a rock and creating a spring (Paris: Bibliothèque Nationale, Cabinet des Medailles. Another Etruscan artifact (&quot;Nethunus&quot;, from the Luynes collection) depicts the god causing a horse to spring from the earth with a blow of his trident.

A late-fourth-century bronze mirror in the Vatican Museums (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco: C.S.E. Vaticano 1.5a) depicts Neptune with Amymone (daughter of Danaus), whom he saves from assault by a satyr and teaches the art of creating springs. On a bronze mirror from Tuscania dated to 350 BC, also in the Vatican Museums (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco E. S. 1. 76), Nethuns is talking to Usil and Thesan. He holds a double-ended trident, suggesting that he might be able wield lightning bolts.
