<text>Alstom SA is a French multinational rolling stock manufacturer which operates worldwide in rail transport markets. It is active in the fields of passenger transportation, signaling, and locomotives, producing high-speed, suburban, regional and urban trains along with trams.

The company and its name (originally spelled Alsthom) was formed by a merger between the electric engineering division of Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (Als) and Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston (thom) in 1928. Significant acquisitions later included the Constructions Électriques de France (1932), shipbuilder Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique (1976), and parts of ACEC (late-1980s).

A merger with parts of the British General Electric Company formed GEC Alsthom in 1989. Throughout the 1990s, the company expanded its holdings in the rail sector, acquiring German rolling stock manufacturer Linke-Hofmann-Busch and Italian rail signaling specialist Sasib Railways. In 1998, GEC Alsthom was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and, later that year, it was rebranded Alstom. At the time, the company was manufacturing railway rolling stock, power generation equipment and ships.

In 2003, the company required a €3.2 billion bailout from the French government. As a result, Alstom was compelled to dispose of several of its divisions, including shipbuilding and electrical transmission to Areva, in order to comply with European Union rules on state aid. In 2004, Alstom remained in financial difficulties, having incurred massive unexpected costs (€4 billion) arising from a design flaw inherited from the acquisition of ABB&#x27;s turbine business, in addition to losses in other business sectors.

In 2014, General Electric (GE) announced that it reached a deal to purchase Alstom&#x27;s power and grid divisions for US$17 billion (€12.4 billion). The deal came under heavy scrutiny from French regulators who saw the business as a strategically important domestic industry. To secure approval, GE agreed to form joint ventures with French companies in power generation and transmission, Alstom&#x27;s heavy gas turbine business was sold to Ansaldo Energia, and GE agreed to sell Alstom&#x27;s rail signalling business. The deal was finalised in November 2015; since then, Alstom has been operating solely in the rail sector.

In an attempt to grow its rail business, in late-2017, Alstom announced a proposed merger with Siemens Mobility. However, in February 2019, the European Commission prohibited the merger. Subsequently, in February 2020, the company signed a letter of agreement to purchase the transportation division of the financially struggling Bombardier Inc. The purchase was finalized in January 2021.

== History ==
=== Alsthom (1928–1989) ===
Alsthom was founded in 1928 from the merger of the French heavy engineering subsidiary of the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, the Compagnie française Thomson Houston, CFTH, and of the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques. In 1932, Alsthom expanded into transportation by acquiring the , Tarbes, a manufacturer of electric locomotives as well as electrical and hydraulic equipment.

In 1969, Compagnie Générale d&#x27;Électricité (CGE) became the majority shareholder of Alsthom. In 1976, Alsthom merged with Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique, becoming Alsthom Atlantique. Thus, the business expanded into marine. The next year, it constructed the first 1300 MW generator set for the Paluel Nuclear Power Plant, setting a world record with an output of 1500 MW.

In 1978, Alsthom delivered its first TGV to SNCF. The TGV went on to break world rail speed records in 1981 (at ) and in 1990 (at ). It also set the world endurance record for high-speed train lines in 2001, travelling the from Calais to Marseille in 3 hours and 29 minutes. In 1986, Alsthom Belfort received an order from EDF for the largest gas turbine in the world (212 MW).

In 1988–89, the holding company, CGEE Alsthom, acquired ACEC Énergie (hydroturbines and electrical equipment for the nuclear industry) and ACEC Automatisme (automation) from the dissolution of the Belgian electrical engineering company Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi. Alsthom acquired 100% of ACEC&#x27;s transport division and renamed it ACEC Transport.

=== GEC Alsthom (1989–1998) ===

In early 1989, GEC Alsthom was formed from a 50–50 merger of Alsthom and the Power Systems Division of the British General Electric Company; for Alsthom this move was intended to aid Alsthom in selling its products outside the French market. In May of that year GEC Alsthom bought British rail vehicle manufacturer Metro-Cammell.
During the early-1990s, GEC Alsthom was the principal manufacturer of the British Rail Class 373, a variant of their TGV family specially designed for traversing the Channel Tunnel between the UK and France. Although collectively operated by Eurostar, the type was ordered by three different railway companies: 16 by SNCF, four by NMBS/SNCB, and 18 by British Rail, of which seven were shortened &quot;North of London&quot; sets. The first Class 373 set was completed at GEC Alstom&#x27;s Belfort facility during 1992.

In 1994, GEC Alsthom acquired a 51% shareholding in Linke-Hofmann-Busch from Salzgitter AG. In 1995, the company acquired the remaining shares in the steam turbine manufacturer MAN Energie. In early 1998, GEC Alsthom acquired the electrical contractor Cegelec, renaming it &quot;Alstom Power Conversion&quot;.

In 1998, GEC Alsthom bought Italian firm SASIB&#x27;s rail signalling subsidiary &quot;Sasib Railways&quot;, which included the former General Railway Signal (USA).

In June 1998, GEC Alsthom was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange; both GEC and Alcatel elected to sell off part of their stakes (23.6% each). Around this time, the company was officially renamed &quot;Alstom&quot;.

=== Alstom (1999–2014) ===

In 1999, Alstom bought half of ABB&#x27;s power systems division, forming a 50-50 joint company known as ABB Alstom Power. Alstom also bought Canada&#x27;s Télécité, a passenger information and security solutions company, and sold its heavy-duty gas turbine business to General Electric. The next year, the company bought out ABB&#x27;s share in the former joint venture ABB Alstom Power.

In 2000, Alstom sold its diesel engine businesses (Ruston, Paxman, and Mirrlees Blackstone) to MAN Group. It also acquired a 51% stake in Italian rail manufacturer Fiat Ferroviaria, a world leader in tilting technology. In April 2003, Alstom sold its industrial turbine business to Siemens for €1.1 billion.

By 2003, Alstom was facing a financial crisis caused by a mix of poor sales and over $5 billion of debt liabilities. It reportedly had the potential to force the company&#x27;s liquidation. These heavy debts were largely due to a $4 billion charge over a design flaw in a turbine developed by ABB, acquired by Alstom in 2000, as well as the collapse of customer Renaissance Cruises amid a general downturn in the marine market. Alstom&#x27;s share price had dropped by 90% over two years. The European Commission objected to a €3.2 billion rescue plan involving the French state; European Union competition law bans most state aid without EC permission. This was obtained, but required Alstom to sell several of its subsidiaries, including its shipbuilding and electrical transmission assets.

In 2004, the French state took a 21% stake in Alstom for €772 million and Alstom received an EU-approved bailout worth in total €2.5 billion. The company sold its electrical transmission and distribution (&quot;grid&quot;) activities to Areva, the diesel locomotive manufacturer Meinfesa to Vossloh, and Alstom Power Rentals to APR LLC. Six years later, Alstom re-acquired the electric power transmission division of Areva.

In 2005, the former Metro-Cammell rail vehicle works in Washwood Heath closed. In the same year, Alstom sold its Australian subsidiary, Alstom Transport Australia and New Zealand, to United Group, which became part of the latter&#x27;s UGL Rail division. Alstom would restart its manufacturing operations in Australia by the early 2010s.

In 2006, Alstom sold its Marine Division to the Norwegian group Aker Yards, with a commitment to retain 25% of the shares until 2010; it also sold Alstom Power Conversion, which became Converteam, in a leveraged buy-out deal funded by Barclays Private Equity France SAS.

In June 2006, Bouygues acquired the French government&#x27;s 21% holding in Alstom for €2 billion. Later that year, Bouygues elected to increase its shareholding in the firm to 24%.
In 2007, the TGV POS set the world speed record for rail vehicles of . In March, Alstom acquired &quot;Power Systems Manufacturing LLC&quot; (Florida, USA) a manufacturer of gas turbine components from Calpine Corporation for $242 million. In June, Alstom acquired the Spanish wind turbine manufacturer Ecotècnia, renamed as Alstom Ecotècnia (since 2010 Alstom Wind). The company also adopted a new graphic chart (logo, corporate identity) using &quot;alstom&quot; as its trading name, reserving &quot;Alstom SA&quot; for legal documents.

In 2009, Alstom acquired a 25% stake in the Russian locomotive manufacturer Transmashholding. Six years later, Alstom decided to increase its shareholding in Transmashholding to 33% at a reported cost of €54 million. As a consequence of an alignment agreement between Transmashholding and another entity, LocoTech-Service, Alstom&#x27;s stake in the former decreased to 20% in August 2018.

In 2011, Alstom and the Iraqi government signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the construction of a new high-speed rail line between Baghdad and Basra.

In 2012, Alstom opened construction of factories at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, Canada (passenger rail vehicles). After a consortium of Alstom (Alstom Wind), EDF, and DONG Energy was awarded three major French offshore wind farm contracts, the company initiated construction of factories at Cherbourg-en-Cotentin (turbine blades in association with LM Power, also wind turbine towers) and Saint-Nazaire (Nacelles and generators).

Also in 2012, the company formed a joint venture with RusHydro to manufacture hydropower equipment for small and medium power hydropower plants. (up to about 100MW.)

Late in 2012, to further the development of its tidal energy business, Alstom acquired Tidal Generation Ltd from Rolls-Royce, however this was later sold to GE in 2015 as part of the sale of Alstom&#x27;s energy business.

In November 2013, Alstom announced it planned to raise €1 to €2 billion through sale of some non-core assets, plus the possible sale of a stake in Alstom Transport, and cut 1,300 jobs. In 2014, Alstom sold its steam auxiliary components activities (air preheaters and gas-gas heaters for thermal power, other industrial heat transfer equipment, and grinding mills) to Triton Partners for €730 million.

In November 2014 Alstom was awarded a $429.4 million contract to modernise 85 trains for the Mexico City Metro system.

==== Judicial investigations ====
Starting in 2009, Alstom&#x27;s practices were questioned by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), which violated the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This American law has extraterritorial scope. At the time, Alstom seemed to cooperate with the proceedings. In 2010, the DOJ opened an investigation into Alstom&#x27;s commercial practices, focusing on a 2003 deal in Indonesia valued at $118 million in particular.

On April 13, 2013, Alstom senior executive Frédéric Pierucci was arrested at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. He was accused of willful blindness of his company&#x27;s suspected corruption and was imprisoned in a high security facility for 14 months and denied release on bail until the week of Alstom&#x27;s acquisition by the US conglomerate General Electric. In late 2014, Alstom was fined $772 million by the DOJ, and admitted guilt under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in relation to bribes paid to obtain contracts in various countries.

In mid-2014, Alstom Network UK was charged by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in relation to corruption offences alleged to have been committed when obtaining transportation contracts in India, Poland and Tunisia, covered under sections 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and Criminal Law Act 1977. Further charges were brought in late 2014 by the SFO in relation to corrupt practices used to obtain energy contracts in Lithuania. Additional charges relating to contracts for the Budapest Metro in Hungary were added in April 2015. In December 2018, three executives of Alstom were found guilty of conspiracy to corrupt following an investigation by the SFO into allegations of several Lithuanian politicians and officials being offered bribes in return for securing contracts.

In February 2020, the United Nations published a database of all business enterprises involved in certain specified activities related to the Israeli settlements. Alstom has been listed on the database in light of its involvement in activities related to &quot;the provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements&quot; and &quot;the use of natural resources, in particular water and land, for business purposes&quot;. On 5 July 2021, Norway&#x27;s largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from Alstom together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

=== Sale of energy businesses to General Electric ===
On 24 April 2014, unconfirmed reports claimed that US conglomerate General Electric (GE) was in acquisition talks with Alstom for $13 billion with the support of 29%-shareholder Bouygues, causing Alstom&#x27;s share price to rise 18% in one day. On 27 April, Le Figaro reported that a rival &#x27;cash plus asset swap&#x27; offer was issued by Siemens, trading Alstom&#x27;s power business for part of its rail arm, plus a cash offer as good as GE&#x27;s and job guarantees. Siemens&#x27; bid was reportedly promoted by French economic minister Arnaud Montebourg. Siemens and Alstom had a greater product overlap and thus a greater risk to jobs, along with potential issues with EU competition regulators. Siemens&#x27; offer was characterised as &quot;defensive&quot;, being skeptically received by investors and analysts.

On 29 April, Reuters reported that Alstom&#x27;s board had accepted a €10 billion bid by GE for its energy division; In a letter from GE executive Jeffrey R. Immelt to President François Hollande published in &quot;Les Echos&quot;, Immelt gave assurances about continued investment in Alstom&#x27;s French activities, the security of the civil nuclear sector, and on job commitments made by Alstom Wind, whilst making its wind activities available to investors. On 30 April, Alstom confirmed that an offer for its power and grid divisions (representing an equity value of €12.35 billion, €11.4 billion enterprise value) was under review with key interests including the French state. On 30 April, GE confirmed it had made a $16.9 billion offer, comprising a $13.5 billion value plus $3.4 billion cash. On 5 May, GE offered to buy one-fourth of the shares in Alstom&#x27;s Indian power and distribution companies – &quot;Alstom T&amp;D India&quot; and &quot;Alstom India&quot; – at 261.25 and 382.20 rupees a share (value US$278 million and $111 million respectively) subject to its bid for Alstom SA being successful.

On 5 May 2014, the French government stated it did not back GE&#x27;s bid, citing concerns on the future of Alstom&#x27;s rail division as a smaller separate entity, suggesting that GE transfer its own rail division to Alstom; other concerns were over the civil nuclear field&#x27;s national independence, and French jobs. On 14 May, France issued a decree (&quot;Décret n° 2014-479 du 14 mai 2014&quot;.), nicknamed &quot;décret Alstom&quot;, extending to power of the state to veto the takeover of &quot;strategic interests&quot; into areas of energy supply, water, transport, telecoms and public health. Both the French employer organisation MEDEF and the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services (Michel Barnier) responded negatively to the decree.

On 16 June, Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) submitted a competing offer for Siemens to acquire Alstom&#x27;s gas turbine activities for €3.9 billion while MHI would form joint ventures with Alstom, acquiring 40%, 20% and 20% stakes in Alstom&#x27;s steam and nuclear, electrical grid, and hydroelectric businesses respectively, for €3.1 billion. The proposal included an offer to buy a further 10% stake from shareholder Bouygues and an option to form a rail transport joint venture. On 19 June, GE revised its bid, matching the same price with a lower cash transaction value; it also proposed forming a joint venture of their renewable, electric grid, steam turbine and nuclear power businesses. GE announced a memorandum of understanding between the two firms in the rail sector and the sale of GE&#x27;s rail signalling unit to Alstom. On 20 June, Siemens and MHI modified their bid, with MHI increasing its stake in Alstom&#x27;s steam, hydro, and grid businesses to 40% in all three (total €3.9 billion) while Siemens increased its offer by €400 million to €4.3 billion. Subsequently, Economy minister Arnaud Montebourg stated he would block both bids, but the French government backed GE&#x27;s offer and had given GE more specifications on commitments and guarantees; it also intended to buy two-thirds of Bouygues&#x27; shareholding (20%). The next day, Alstom&#x27;s board backed GE&#x27;s revised bid. On 22 June, the French state agreed terms with Bouygues, buying a 20% stake in Alstom from Bouygues at a 2–5% discount on a minimum value of ≈€35 per share.

Initially, the acquisition was expected to be finalised by early 2015. In early 2015, the EU Competition Commission began examining the deal. Both EU and US competition regulators approved the deal by September 2015, subject to the divestiture of Alstom&#x27;s large and very large gas turbine (GT26 and GT36 models) manufacturing and service business; and its GE7FA gas turbine aftermarket parts subsidiary business, &quot;Power Systems Mfg. LLC&quot; (PSM), to another company, Ansaldo Energia.

The sale of Alstom&#x27;s energy division to GE was finalised on 2 November 2015; the final valuation being €12.4 billion, of which €9.7 billion was transferred to Alstom, the remainder being reinvested in GE/Alstom joint ventures plus other corrections. The acquired businesses were reorganised within GE&#x27;s existing power generation business (&quot;GE Power &amp; Water&quot;) as GE Power. The remainder of Alstom Group, including GE Signalling (acquired via a €700 million deal), refocused on rail transport. Due to the acquisition, GE accrued $17.3bn of goodwill, consisting of Alstom&#x27;s negative book value of $7.2bn at the time of acquisition and the $10.1bn purchase price. In October 2018, GE wrote-off $23bn from the value of its power industry division, largely attributed to the Alstom purchase.

=== November 2015 – present ===

In November 2015, Alstom was awarded a contract by the Indian Railways to construct an electric locomotive factory in Madhepura (Bihar), receiving an initial order of 800 twin-section 9MW locomotives for use on the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, valued at ₹190 billion (about US$2.9 billion). This factory was to be operated under a joint venture with the Ministry of Railways (26%) at a cost of ₹ 13 billion (roughly US$200 million).

In September 2015, it was announced that Amtrak would award Alstom a contract for $2.5 billion for the next generation high-speed train sets for the Northeast Corridor. This would result in the creation of 750 jobs across upstate New York with 400 direct manufacturing jobs at Alstom. The order for 28 Avelia Liberty trainsets was officially confirmed in August 2016 by Amtrak. These trainsets are manufactured at Alstom&#x27;s plant in Hornell, New York.

In March 2016, a joint venture of Alstom and Gibela began construction of a new train building factory in Dunnotar, outside of Johannesburg, South Africa. Initial orders for the factory included 580 X&#x27;Trapolis Mega passenger trains for Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa under a €4 billion contract that was awarded in 2013.

In September 2016, Alstom announced it was to cease locomotive manufacturing at its Belfort (France) site by 2018 due to low orders; remaining production activity was to be transferred to its facility of Alstom DDF in Reichshoffen, Alsace. However, during October 2016, the French state placed an order of about €650 million for 15 TGV Euroduplex trains; an order for 20 locomotives; plus an order for 30 intercity trains to be built at Reichshoffen. Together, these orders were sufficient to prevent the Belfort plant&#x27;s closure in the short to medium term.

In June 2017, Alstom opened the largest train modernisation facility in the UK at Halebank on the outskirts of Liverpool. Initial work involved the repainting of the Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot;s.

On 12 November 2024, Alstom announced on their official website that the first of 35 fully automated metropolis trains has been delivered to Taiwan. The four-car stainless-steel train can carry up to 700 passengers, including 108 seated, with speeds up to 100 km/h.

==== Attempted merger with Siemens Mobility ====
On 26 September 2017, Alstom announced a proposal to merge with Siemens Mobility, the rolling stock division of German conglomerate Siemens; this merger was promoted as the creation of &quot;a new European champion in the rail industry&quot;. The combined rail business, which was to have been reportedly named &quot;Siemens Alstom&quot; and headquartered in Paris, would have $18 billion U.S. in revenue and employ 62,300 people in more than 60 countries. During November 2018, the European Commission voiced its concerns surrounding the proposed merger of the two companies, particularly that the combined entity would be too dominant in the European market; alleged impacts from such dominance included potential increases in passenger fares and cargo fees. Furthermore, a series of popular protests concerning the financial reforms of both the French territorial railway infrastructure and SNCF occurred.

The proposed merger was viewed by some as a measure to counter the rise of rival Chinese rail business CRRC; it reportedly received support from many figures within both the French and German governments. The transaction, which was originally due to close by the end of 2018, was met with opposition by French trade union officials who voiced their concerns that such a merger would have the potential for job losses. On 17 July 2018, Alstom shareholders overwhelmingly approved the proposed merger with Siemens. On 6 February 2019, the planned merger between the two companies was vetoed by the European Commission. In response to this ruling, Alstom&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer Henri Poupart-Lafarge stated that he viewed the decision to block the merger was a result of &quot;ideological prejudices&quot;.

==== Acquisition of Bombardier Transportation ====
In mid-February 2020, Alstom announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Agreement to buy Bombardier Transportation, the multinational train maker headquartered in Berlin, Germany for between €5.8 billion and €6.2 billion. The deal required the approval by Alstom shareholders at a meeting to be held in October 2020 and approval by European regulators. Bombardier&#x27;s major shareholder, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, had already agreed to the sale.

In July 2020, it was announced that the EU competition authorities had approved the purchase. To finish the deal, Alstom had to sell the Alstom DDF factory based in France, a regional train division, a Bombardier facility in Germany, and a Bombardier trains division. The company also had to provide guarantees and pass on some of Bombardier&#x27;s assets.

==== Electric road ====
Alstom has developed a ground-level power supply (alimentation par le sol - APS) system for use with buses and other vehicles. The system has been tested for compatibility with snow plows and for safety under exposure to snow, ice, salting, and saturated brine. The eRoadMontBlanc project is set to trial Alstom&#x27;s electric road system on the public road RN205 on trucks and other vehicles in the Rhône-Alpes region between 2024 and 2027. This is anticipated to be the first public electric road in France.

==== 2024 debt restructuring ====

Alstom plans in 2024 to issue €1.75 billion of shares and bonds to reduce its debt, which was at risk of a credit downgrade into junk bond status.

== Transport ==
Alstom Transport develops and markets a complete range of systems, equipment, and service in the railway industry. The division had annual sales of €5.5 billion in 2013. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of high-speed trains, tramways and metros, electrical and diesel trains, information systems, traction systems, power supply systems, and track work. The company also operates in the rail infrastructure market, designing, producing, and installing infrastructure for the rail network. These include information solutions, electrification, communication systems, track laying, station utilities, as well as workshops and depots. Maintenance, rebuilding, and renovation services are also provided by the company. Alstom Transport operates in 70 countries and employs 26,000 people.

Notable products includes series production of the TGV high-speed trains with over 650 trainsets sold over 25 years, as well as the London Underground 1995 Stock, London Underground 1996 Stock, British Rail Class 390 and AGV.

Since a merger with General Railway Signal in 1998, Alstom has been manufacturing railway signaling equipment at a former GRS factory located in a suburb near Rochester, New York. After the merger with GE signaling the manufacturing was transferred to Missouri, and GRS factory kept engineering the GRS legacy products.

Since 2002, Alstom has manufactured the Pendolino tilting train, following the acquisition of Fiat Ferroviaria.

The company also produces Citadis trams; in 2007, over 1,100 Citadis trams were in use by 28 cities including Dublin, Algiers, Barcelona, Melbourne, Rotterdam and Paris.

Between 2007 and 2010, the company produced 1,002 R160A New York City subway cars at its manufacturing plant in Hornell, New York, while the body shells were built at their Lapa plant, in São Paulo, Brazil. In 2013, Alstom was awarded the contract to supply 168 coaches to Chennai Metro at a cost of . The company also owns the tender for supplying coaches to Kochi Metro.
In September 2015, it was announced in Hornell, New York, by Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) that Amtrak will be awarding Alstom a contract for $2.45 billion for the next-generation high-speed train sets for the Northeast Corridor. This would result in the creation of 750 jobs across upstate New York with 400 direct manufacturing jobs at Alstom. The new trainsets will be able to reach speeds up to 186 mph and feature active tilting technology. The 28 new train sets are scheduled to enter service by 2023.

Next-generation high-speed trains under development by Alstom are the Avelia family: ETR 675, Avelia Horizon and Avelia Liberty.

Ottawa LRT cars Alstom Citadis Spirit are manufactured in Hornell, but assembly completed in Ottawa, Ontario, and Brampton, Ontario.

== Former businesses ==
=== Power generation ===
Alstom power activities were collectively called Alstom Power Systems and included the design, manufacturing, services, and supply of products and systems for the power generation sector and industrial markets. The group covered most energy sources, including gas, coal, nuclear, hydro, wind. Power Systems provided components for power generation including boilers, steam turbines, and gas turbines, wind turbines, generators, air quality control systems, and monitoring and control systems for power plants, as well as related products. It had a special focus on boilers and emissions control equipment.

Power Systems also provided services such as product retrofitting for nuclear and fossil steam turbines and refurbishment of existing power plants. It performed maintenance and servicing under long-term agreements for its own turbines, as well as those manufactured by GE and Siemens.

In Russia, the company serviced nuclear equipment under a joint agreement with Atomenergomash and provided technology transfer for a project of floating nuclear power plants. In Brazil, Alstom, together with Bardella, ran a joint venture called Indústria Metalúrgica e Mecânica da Amazônia to build hydroelectric power plants throughout the Amazon and Latin American regions. In India, Alstom had a joint venture with Bharat Forge to manage power production from start to finish.

In 2015, the entire power sector was taken over by General Electric.

=== Alstom Grid ===
A third business section based on power transmission was formed on 7 June 2010 with the acquisition of the transmission business of Areva SA. The division manufactures equipment for the entire chain of electrical power transmission, including ultra-high voltage transmission lines (both AC and DC).
Alstom Grid is headquartered at La Défense, the business district west of Paris, and has four main businesses: electrical transmission system products, power electric system, automation, and service. Alstom Grid has roughly 10% of the global market share.

In 2015, the grid division was taken over by General Electric and renamed as &quot;GE Grid Solutions&quot;.

== Financial information ==
Alstom was listed on the London, New York and Paris Stock Exchanges when it was floated on 22 June 1998. Following the financial reconstruction in 2003, the company remained listed on the Paris Stock Exchange, but was delisted from the London Stock Exchange on 17 November 2003 and the New York Stock Exchange in August 2004.

<text>Rehe, previously romanized as Jehol, was a former Chinese special administrative region and province centered on the city of Rehe, now known as Chengde.

== Administration ==
Rehe was north of the Great Wall and east of Mongolia in southwestern Manchuria. Its capital and largest city was Chengde. The second largest city was Chaoyang, followed by Chifeng. The province covered 114,000 square kilometers.

== History ==
Rehe was once at the core of the Khitan-led Liao Dynasty. Rehe was conquered by the Manchu banners before they took possession of Beijing in 1644. Between 1703 and 1820, the Qing emperors spent almost each summer in their summer Mountain Resort in Chengde. They governed the empire from Chengde, and received their foreign diplomats and representatives of vassal and tributary countries. The Kangxi emperor restricted the admission to the forests and prairies of Rehe to the court&#x27;s hunting expeditions and to the maintenance of the imperial cavalry. Agricultural settlements were at first forbidden to Han Chinese. In the early 19th century, by which time Rehe had become part of the province of Zhili, migrants from Hebei and Liaoning settled in Rehe and displaced the Mongol communities.

The Republic of China created the Jehol Special Area in 1914 and Jehol Province in 1923. To form a buffer zone between China proper and Japanese-controlled Manchukuo, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Jehol in Operation Nekka on 21 January 1933. It was subsequently annexed by the Empire of Manchukuo, as Jehol Province. The seizure of Jehol deteriorated relations between Japan and China, and was one of the incidents that led to the Second Sino-Japanese War.

At the end of World War II, when the Republic of China resumed control of Manchuria, the Kuomintang government continued to administer the area as a separate province, reverting its name to Jehol Province, with its capital in Hailar. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and enactment of pinyin in 1958, the area has retrospectively become known as Rehe Province. However, the province had already been divided between Hebei Province, Liaoning Province, Tianjin, and Inner Mongolia in 1955.

<text>The Golden Gate is a strait on the west coast of North America that connects San Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean. It is defined by the headlands of the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Peninsula, and, since 1937, has been spanned by the Golden Gate Bridge. The entire shoreline and adjacent waters throughout the strait are managed by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

== Geology ==
During the last ice age, when sea level was several hundred feet lower, the waters of the glacier-fed Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River scoured a deep channel through the bedrock on their way to the ocean. (A similar process created the undersea Hudson Canyon off the coast of New York and New Jersey.) The strait is well known today for its depth and powerful tidal currents from the Pacific Ocean. Many small whirlpools and eddies can form in its waters. With its strong currents, rocky reefs and fog, the Golden Gate is the site of over 100 shipwrecks.

== Climate ==

The Golden Gate is often shrouded in coastal fog, especially during the summer. Heat generated in the California Central Valley causes air there to rise, creating a low pressure area that pulls in cool, moist air from over the Pacific Ocean. The Golden Gate forms the largest break in the hills of the California Coast Range, allowing a persistent, dense stream of fog to enter the bay there. Although there is no weather station on Golden Gate proper, the area has a mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with very narrow temperature fluctuations, cool summers and mild winters. For the nearest weather station see the weatherbox of San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge being nearer the ocean and at elevation indicate it being cooler during summer days. Nearer the San Francisco urban core, the temperatures resemble the official NOAA weather station instead.

== History ==
Before Europeans arrived in the 18th century, the area around the strait and the bay was inhabited by Native Americans the Ohlone people to the south and Coast Miwok to the north. Descendants of both tribes remain in the area.

The opening to the strait was surprisingly elusive for early European explorers, presumably due to persistent summer fog. The strait is not recorded in the voyages of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo nor Francis Drake, both of whom may have explored the nearby coast in the 16th century in search of the fabled Northwest Passage. The strait is also unrecorded in observations by Spanish galleons on the Manila-Acapulco run from the Philippines that laid up in nearby Drakes Bay to the north. These rarely passed east of the Farallon Islands ( west of the Golden Gate), for fear of the possibility of rocks between the islands and the mainland.

The first recorded observation of the strait occurred nearly two hundred years later than the earliest European explorations of the coast. In 1769, Sgt José Francisco Ortega, the leader of a scouting party sent north along the San Francisco Peninsula by Don Gaspar de Portolá from their expedition encampment in San Pedro Valley to locate the Point Reyes headlands, reported back to Portolá that he could not reach the location because of the existence of the strait. On August 5, 1775 Juan de Ayala and the crew of his ship &quot;San Carlos&quot; became the first Europeans known to have passed through the strait, anchoring in a cove behind Angel Island, the cove now named in Ayala&#x27;s honor. Until the 1840s, the strait was called the &quot;Boca del Puerto de San Francisco&quot; (&quot;Mouth of the Port of San Francisco&quot;). On July 1, 1846, before the discovery of gold in California, the entrance acquired a new name. In his memoirs, John C. Frémont wrote: &quot;To this Gate I gave the name of &#x27;Chrysopylae&#x27;, or &#x27;Golden Gate&#x27;; for the same reasons that the harbor of Byzantium was called Chrysoceras, or Golden Horn.&quot; He went on to comment that the strait was &quot;a golden gate to trade with the Orient&quot;.

=== 1920s ===
The U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp on May 1, 1923, celebrating &quot;The Golden Gate&quot;, portraying the schooner USS &quot;Babcock&quot; passing through an empty strait. The &quot;Babcock&quot; served in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919, with San Francisco as its port of call.

=== Golden Gate Bridge ===

In 1933 construction began on the Golden Gate Bridge, a suspension bridge connecting the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County. Today it is part of both US Highway 101 and California Route 1. 

The Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when completed in 1937 and is an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco and the state of California. Since its completion the span has been surpassed by eighteen other bridges and remains second longest in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. In 2007, it was ranked fifth on the &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; by the American Institute of Architects.

== Navigation ==
The Golden Gate strait serves as the primary access channel for navigation to and from the San Francisco Bay, one of the largest cargo ports in the United States. Commercial ports includes the Port of Oakland, the Port of Richmond, and the Port of San Francisco. Commercial cargo ships use the Golden Gate to access the San Francisco Bay, as well as barges, tankers, fishing boats, cruise ships, and privately owned boats, including wind-surfers and kite-boards. About 9000 ships moved through the Golden Gate in 2014, and a similar amount in 2015. The U.S Coast Guard maintains a Vessel Traffic Service to monitor and regulate vessel traffic through the Golden Gate.

For navigational guidance, there are white and green lights on the center of the span of the Golden Gate Bridge. Lighthouses with beacons and foghorns provide alerts at Point Bonita, Point Diablo, Lime Point and Mile Rocks. Before the Golden Gate Bridge was built, a lighthouse protected the south side of the strait at Fort Point. Buoys and radar reflectors provide additional navigational aid at various locations throughout the strait.

<doc id="141986" wikidata="Q205783" url="?curid=141986" title="Toussaint Louverture">
<text>François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture (, ) also known as Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda (20 May 1743 – 7 April 1803), was a Haitian general and the most prominent leader of the Haitian Revolution. During his life, Louverture first fought and allied with Spanish forces against Saint-Domingue Royalists, then joined with Republican France, becoming Governor-General-for-life of Saint-Domingue, and lastly fought against Bonaparte&#x27;s republican troops. As a revolutionary leader, Louverture displayed military and political acumen that helped transform the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. Along with Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Louverture is now known as one of the &quot;Fathers of Haiti&quot;.

Toussaint Louverture was born as a slave in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now known as Haiti. He was a devout Catholic, and was manumitted as an &quot;affranchi&quot; (ex-slave) before the French Revolution, identifying as a Creole for the greater part of his life. During his time as an &quot;affranchi&quot;, he became a salaried employee, an overseer of his former master&#x27;s plantation, and later became a wealthy slave owner himself; Toussaint Louverture owned several coffee plantations at Petit Cormier, Grande Rivière, and Ennery. At the start of the Haitian revolution he was nearly 50 years old and began his military career as a lieutenant to Georges Biassou, an early leader of the 1791 War for Freedom in Saint-Domingue. Initially allied with the Spaniards of neighboring Santo Domingo, Louverture switched his allegiance to the French when the new Republican government abolished slavery. Louverture gradually established control over the whole island and used his political and military influence to gain dominance over his rivals.

Throughout his years in power, he worked to balance the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labor; negotiated trade agreements with the United Kingdom and the United States and maintained a large and well-trained army. Louverture seized power in Saint-Domingue, established his own system of government, and promulgated his own colonial constitution in 1801 that named him as Governor-General for Life, which challenged Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s authority.

In 1802, he was invited to a parley by French Divisional General Jean-Baptiste Brunet, but was arrested upon his arrival. He was deported to France and jailed at the Fort de Joux. He died in 1803. Although Louverture died before the final and most violent stage of the Haitian Revolution, his achievements set the grounds for the Haitian army&#x27;s final victory. Suffering massive losses in multiple battles at the hands of the British and Haitian armies and losing thousands of men to yellow fever, the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from Saint-Domingue the very same year. The Haitian Revolution continued under Louverture&#x27;s lieutenant, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who declared independence on 1 January 1804, thereby establishing the sovereign state of Haiti.

== Early life ==
===Birth, parentage, and childhood===
Louverture was born into slavery, the eldest son of Hyppolite, an Allada slave from the slave coast of West Africa, and his second wife Pauline, a slave from the Aja ethnic group, and given the name Toussaint at birth. Louverture&#x27;s son Issac would later name his great-grandfather, Hyppolite&#x27;s father, as Gaou Guinou and a son of the King of Allada, although there is little extant evidence of this. The name Gaou possibly originated in the title Deguenon, meaning &quot;old man&quot; or &quot;wise man&quot; in the Allada kingdom, making Gaou Guinou and his son Hyppolite members of the bureaucracy or nobility, but not members of the royal family. In Africa, Hyppolite and his first wife, Catherine, were forced into enslavement due to a series of imperialist wars of expansion by the Kingdom of Dahomey into the Allada territory. In order to remove their political rivals and obtain European trade goods, Dahomean slavers separated the couple and sold them to the crew of the French slave ship &quot;Hermione&quot;, which then sailed to the French West Indies. The original names of Toussaint&#x27;s parents are unknown, since the &quot;Code Noir&quot; mandated that slaves brought to their colonies be made into Catholics, stripped of their African names, and be given more European names in order to assimilate them into the French plantation system. Toussaint&#x27;s father received the name Hyppolite upon his baptism on Saint-Domingue, as Latin and Greek names were the most fashionable for slaves at this time, followed by French, and Biblical Christian names.

Louverture is thought to have been born on the plantation of Bréda at Haut-du-Cap in Saint-Domingue, where his parents were enslaved and where he would spend the majority of his life before the revolution. His parents would go on to have several children after him, with five surviving infancy; Marie-Jean, Paul, Pierre, Jean, and Gaou, named for his grandfather. Louverture would grow closest to his younger brother Paul, who along with his other siblings were baptized into the Catholic Church by the local Jesuit Order. Pierre-Baptiste Simon, a carpenter and gatekeeper on the Bréda plantation, is considered to have been Louverture&#x27;s godfather and went on to become a parental figure to Louverture&#x27;s family, along with his foster mother Pelage, after the death of Toussaint&#x27;s parents. Growing up, Toussaint first learned to speak the African Fon language of the Allada slaves on the plantation, then the Creole French of the greater colony, and eventually the Standard French of the elite class (&quot;grands blancs&quot;) during the revolution.

Although he would later become known for his stamina and riding prowess, Louverture earned the nickname &quot;Fatras-Bâton&quot; (&quot;sickly stick&quot;), in reference to his small thin stature in his youth. Toussaint and his siblings were trained to be domestic servants with Louverture being trained as an equestrian and coachmen after showing a talent for handling the horses and oxen on the plantation. This allowed the siblings to work in the manor house and stables, away from the grueling physical labor and deadly corporal punishment meted out in the sugar-cane fields. In spite of this relative privilege, there is evidence that even in his youth Louverture&#x27;s pride pushed him to engage in fights with members of the &quot;Petits-blancs&quot; (white commoner) community, who worked on the plantation as hired help. There is a record that Louverture beat a young &quot;petit blanc&quot; named Ferere, but was able to escape punishment after being protected by the new plantation overseer, François Antoine Bayon de Libertat. De Libertat had become steward of the Bréda property after it was inherited by Pantaléon de Bréda Jr., a &quot;grand blanc&quot; (white nobleman), and managed by Bréda&#x27;s nephew the Count of Noah. In spite or perhaps because of this protection, Louverture went on to engage in other fights. On one occasion, he threw the plantation attorney Bergé off a horse belonging to the Bréda plantation, when he attempted to take it outside the bounds of the property without permission.

=== First marriage and manumission ===
Until 1938, historians believed that Louverture had been a slave until the start of the revolution. In the later 20th century, discovery of a personal marriage certificate and baptismal record dated between 1776 and 1777 documented that Louverture was a freeman, meaning that he had been manumitted sometime between 1772 and 1776, the time de Libertat had become overseer. This finding retrospectively clarified a private letter that Louverture sent to the French government in 1797, in which he mentioned he had been free for more than twenty years.

Upon being freed, Toussaint took up the name of Toussaint de Bréda (Toussaint of Bréda), or more simply Toussaint Bréda, in reference to the plantation where he grew up. Toussaint went from being a slave of the Bréda plantation to becoming a member of the greater community of &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; (free people of color). This was a diverse group of &quot;Affranchis&quot; (freed slaves), free blacks of full or majority African ancestry, and &quot;Mulattos&quot; (mixed-race peoples), which included the children of French planters and their African slaves, as well as distinct multiracial families who had multi-generational mixed ancestries from the varying different populations on the island. The &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; strongly identified with Saint-Domingue, with a popular slogan being that while the French felt at home in France, and the slaves felt at home in Africa, they felt at home on the island. Now enjoying a greater degree of relative freedom, Louverture dedicated himself to building wealth and gaining further social mobility through emulating the model of the &quot;grands blancs&quot; and rich &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; by becoming a planter. He began by renting a small coffee plantation, along with its 13 slaves, from his future son-in-law. One of the slaves Louverture owned at this time is believed to have been Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who would go onto become one of Louverture&#x27;s most loyal lieutenants and a member of his personal guard during the Haitian Revolution.

Between 1761 and 1777, Louverture met and married his first wife, Cécile, in a Catholic ceremony. The couple went on to have two sons, Toussaint Jr. and Gabrielle-Toussaint, and a daughter, Marie-Marthe. During this time, Louverture bought several slaves; although this was a means to grow a greater pool of exploitable labor, this was one of the few legal methods available to free the remaining members of a former slave&#x27;s extended family and social circle. Louverture eventually bought the freedom of Cécile, their children, his sister Marie-Jean, his wife&#x27;s siblings, and a slave named Jean-Baptist, freeing him so that he could legally marry. Louverture&#x27;s own marriage, however, soon became strained and eventually broke down, as his coffee plantation failed to make adequate returns. A few years later, the newly freed Cécile left Louverture for a wealthy &quot;Creole&quot; planter, while Louverture had begun a relationship with a woman named Suzanne, who is believed to have gone on to become his second wife. There is little evidence that any formal divorce occurred, as that was illegal at the time. Louverture, in fact, would go on to completely excise his first marriage from his recollections of his pre-revolutionary life, to the extent that, until recent documents uncovered the marriage, few researchers were aware of the existence of Cécile and her children with Louverture.

===Second marriage===
In 1782, Louverture married his second wife, Suzanne Simone-Baptiste, who is thought to have been his cousin or the daughter of his godfather Pierre-Baptiste. Toward the end of his life, Louverture told General Caffarelli that he had fathered at least 16 children, of whom 11 had predeceased him, between his two wives and a series of mistresses. In 1785, Louverture&#x27;s eldest child, the 24-year-old Toussaint Jr., died from a fever and the family organized a formal Catholic funeral for him. This was officiated by a local priest as a favor for the devout Louverture. Gabrielle-Toussaint disappeared from the historical record at this time and is presumed to have also died, possibly from the same illness that took Toussaint Jr.. Not all of Louverture&#x27;s children can be identified with certainty, but the three children from his first marriage and his three sons from his second marriage are well known. Suzanne&#x27;s eldest child, Placide, is generally thought to have been fathered by Seraphim Le Clerc, a &quot;Creole&quot; planter. In spite of this, Placide was adopted by Louverture and raised as his own. Louverture went on to have at least two sons with Suzanne: Isaac, born in 1784, and Saint-Jean, born in 1791. They would remain enslaved until the start of the revolution, as Louverture spent the 1780s attempting to regain the wealth he had lost with the failure of his coffee plantation in the 1770s.

It appears that during this time Louverture returned to play an important role on the Bréda plantation to remain closer to old friends and his family. He remained there until the outbreak of the revolution as a salaried employee and contributed to the daily functions of the plantation. He took up his old responsibilities of looking after the livestock and care of the horses. By 1789, his responsibilities expanded to include acting as a muleteer, master miller, and possibly a slave-driver, charged with organizing the workforce. During this time the Bréda family attempted to divide the plantation and the slaves on it among a new series of four heirs. In an attempt to protect his foster mother, Pelage, Louverture bought a young 22-year-old female slave and traded her to the Brédas to prevent Pelage from being sold to a new owner. By the start of the revolution, Louverture began to accumulate a moderate fortune and was able to buy a small plot of land adjacent to the Bréda property to build a house for his family. He was nearly 48 years old at this time.

=== Education ===
Louverture gained some education from his godfather Pierre-Baptiste on the Bréda plantation. His extant letters demonstrate a moderate familiarity with Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher who had lived as a slave, while his public speeches showed a familiarity with Machiavelli. Some cite Enlightenment thinker Abbé Raynal, a French critic of slavery, and his publication &quot;Histoire des deux Indes&quot; predicting a slave revolt in the West Indies as a possible influence.

Louverture received a degree of theological education from the Jesuit and Capuchin missionaries through his church attendance and devout Catholicism. His medical knowledge is attributed to a familiarity with the folk medicine of the African plantation slaves and Creole communities, as well as more formal techniques found in the hospitals founded by the Jesuits and the free people of color. Legal documents signed on Louverture&#x27;s behalf between 1778 and 1781 suggest that he could not yet write at that time. Throughout his military and political career during the revolution, he was known to have verbally dictated his letters to his secretaries, who prepared most of his correspondences. A few surviving documents from the end of his life in his own hand confirm that he eventually learned to write, although his Standard French spelling was &quot;strictly phonetic&quot; and closer to the Creole French he spoke for the majority of his life.

==Haitian Revolution==
=== Beginnings of a rebellion: 1789–1793 ===
Beginning in 1789, the black and mulatto population of Saint-Domingue became inspired by a multitude of factors that converged on the island in the late 1780s and early 1790s leading them to organize a series of rebellions against the central white colonial assembly in Le Cap. In 1789 two mix-race &quot;Creole&quot; merchants, Vincent Ogé and Julien Raimond, happened to be in France during the early stages of the French Revolution. Here they began lobbying the French National Assembly to expand voting rights and legal protections from the &quot;grands blancs&quot; to the wealthy slave-owning &quot;gens de couleur,&quot; such as themselves. Being of majority white descent and with Ogé having been educated in France, the two were incensed that their black African ancestry prevented them from having the same legal rights as their fathers, who were both &quot;grand blanc&quot; planters. Rebuffed by the assembly they returned to the colony where Ogé met up with Jean-Baptiste Chavannes, a wealthy mixed-race veteran of the American Revolution and an abolitionist. Here the two organized a small scale revolt in 1790 composed of a few hundred &quot;gens de couleur,&quot; who engaged in several battles against the colonial militias on the island. However, after the movement failed to gain traction Ogé and Chavannes were quickly captured and publicly broken on the wheel in the public square in Le Cap in February 1791. For the slaves on the island worsening conditions due to the neglect of legal protections afforded them by the &quot;Code Noir&quot; stirred animosities and made a revolt more attractive compared to the continued exploitation by the &quot;grands&quot; and &quot;petits blancs&quot;.

Then, the political and social disruption caused by the French Revolution&#x27;s attempt to expand the rights to all men, inspired a series of revolts across several neighbouring French possessions in the Caribbean, which upset much of the established trade among the colonies. Many of the devout Catholic slaves and freedmen, including Toussaint, identified as free Frenchmen and royalists, who desired to protect a series of progressive legal protections afforded to the black citizenry by King Louis XVI and his predecessors.

On 14 August 1791, two hundred members of the black and mixed-race population made up of slave foremen, &quot;Creoles&quot;, and freed slaves gathered in secret at a plantation in Morne-Rouge in the north of Saint-Domingue to plan their revolt. Here prominent early figures of the revolution such as Dutty François Boukman, Jean-François Papillon, Georges Biassou, Jeannot Bullet, and Toussaint gathered to nominate a single leader to guide the revolt. Toussaint, wary of the dangers of taking on such a public role, especially after hearing about what happened to Ogé and Chavannes, went on to nominate Georges Biassou as leader. He would later join his forces as a secretary and lieutenant, and be in command of a small detachment of soldiers. During this time, Toussaint took up the name of &quot;Monsieur&quot; Toussaint, a title that was once been reserved for the white population of Saint-Domingue. Surviving documents show him participating in the leadership of the rebellion, discussing strategy, and negotiating with the Spanish supporters of the rebellion for supplies. Wanting to identify with the royalist cause, Louverture and other rebels wore white cockades upon their sleeves and crosses of St. Louis.

A few days after this gathering, a Vodou ceremony at Bois Caïman marked the public start of the major slave rebellion in the north, which had the largest plantations and enslaved population. Louverture did not openly take part in the earliest stages of the rebellion, as he spent the next few weeks sending his family to safety in Santo Domingo and helping his old overseer Bayon de Libertat. Louverture hid him and his family in a nearby wood, and brought them food from a nearby rebel camp. He eventually helped Bayon de Libertat&#x27;s family escape the island and in the coming years supported them financially as they resettled in the United States and mainland France.
In 1791, Louverture was involved in negotiations between rebel leaders and the French Governor, Blanchelande, for the release of their white prisoners and a return to work, in exchange for a ban on the use of whips, an extra non-working day per week, and the freedom of imprisoned leaders. When the offer was rejected, he was instrumental in preventing the massacre of Biassou&#x27;s white prisoners. The prisoners were released after further negotiations and escorted to Le Cap by Louverture. He hoped to use the occasion to present the rebellion&#x27;s demands to the colonial assembly, but they refused to meet.

Throughout 1792, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, Louverture ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the &quot;Cordon de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;, a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory. He gained a reputation for his discipline, training his men in guerrilla tactics and &quot;the European style of war&quot;. Louverture emphasized brotherhood and fraternity among his troops and aimed to unify individuals of many populations. He used republican rhetoric to rally the varying groups within Saint-Dominigue and was successful in this effort. His favor of fraternity and strict discipline defined the kind of leader he was. After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux, but it was in these battles that the French first recognized him as a significant military leader.

Some time in 1792–1793, Toussaint adopted the surname Louverture, from the French word for &quot;opening&quot; or &quot;the one who opened the way&quot;. Although some modern writers spell his adopted surname with an apostrophe, as in &quot;L&#x27;Ouverture&quot;, he did not. The most common explanation is that it refers to his ability to create openings in battle. The name is sometimes attributed to French commissioner Polverel&#x27;s exclamation: &quot;That man makes an opening everywhere&quot;. Some writers think the name referred to a gap between his front teeth.

=== Alliance with the Spanish: 1793–1794 ===
Despite adhering to royalist views, Louverture began to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution. From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition. After an offer of land, privileges, and recognizing the freedom of slave soldiers and their families, Jean-François and Biassou formally allied with the Spanish in May 1793; Louverture likely did so in early June. He had made covert overtures to General Laveaux prior but was rebuffed as Louverture&#x27;s conditions for alliance were deemed unacceptable. At this time the republicans were yet to make any formal offer to the slaves in arms and conditions for the blacks under the Spanish looked better than that of the French. In response to the civil commissioners&#x27; radical 20 June proclamation (not a general emancipation, but an offer of freedom to male slaves who agreed to fight for them) Louverture stated that &quot;the blacks wanted to serve under a king and the Spanish king offered his protection.&quot;

On 29 August 1793, he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the black population of St. Domingue:
Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St. Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.

On the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue, hoping to bring the black troops over to his side. Initially, this failed, perhaps because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.

However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of slavery. For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux. During this time, his competition with the other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavor on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.

Louverture&#x27;s auxiliary force was employed to great success, with his army responsible for half of all Spanish gains north of the Artibonite in the West in addition to capturing the port town of Gonaïves in December 1793. However, tensions had emerged between Louverture and the Spanish higher-ups. His superior with whom he enjoyed good relations, Matías de Armona, was replaced with Juan de Lleonartwho was disliked by the black auxiliaries. Lleonart failed to support Louverture in March 1794 during his feud with Biassou, who had been stealing supplies for Louverture&#x27;s men and selling their families as slaves. Unlike Jean-François and Bissaou, Louverture refused to round up enslaved women and children to sell to the Spanish. This feud also emphasized Louverture&#x27;s inferior position in the trio of black generals in the minds of the Spanisha check upon any ambitions for further promotion.

On 29 April 1794, the Spanish garrison at Gonaïves was suddenly attacked by black troops fighting in the name of &quot;the King of the French&quot;, who demanded that the garrison surrender. Approximately 150 men were killed and much of the populace forced to flee. White guardsmen in the surrounding area had been murdered, and Spanish patrols sent into the area never returned. Louverture is suspected to have been behind this attack, although was not present. He wrote to the Spanish 5 May protesting his innocencesupported by the Spanish commander of the Gonaïves garrison, who noted that his signature was absent from the rebels&#x27; ultimatum. It was not until 18 May that Louverture would claim responsibility for the attack, when he was fighting under the banner of the French.

The events at Gonaïves made Lleonart increasingly suspicious of Louverture. When they had met at his camp 23 April, the black general had shown up with 150 armed and mounted men, as opposed to the usual 25, choosing not to announce his arrival or waiting for permission to enter. Lleonart found him lacking his usual modesty or submission, and after accepting an invitation to dinner 29 April, Louverture afterward failed to show. The limp that had confined him to his bed during the Gonaïves attack was thought to be feigned and Lleonart suspected him of treachery. Remaining distrustful of the black commander, Lleonart housed his wife and children whilst Louverture led an attack on Dondon in early May, an act which Lleonart later believed confirmed Louverture&#x27;s decision to turn against the Spanish.

===Alliance with the French: 1794–1796===

The timing of and motivation behind Louverture&#x27;s volte-face against Spain remains debated among historians. C. L. R. James claimed that upon learning of the emancipation decree in May 1794, Louverture decided to join the French in June. It is argued by Beaubrun Ardouin that Toussaint was indifferent toward black freedom, concerned primarily for his own safety and resentful over his treatment by the Spanishleading him to officially join the French on 4 May 1794 when he raised the republican flag over Gonaïves. Thomas Ott sees Louverture as &quot;both a power-seeker and sincere abolitionist&quot; who was working with Laveaux since January 1794 and switched sides on 6 May.

Louverture claimed to have switched sides after emancipation was proclaimed and the commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel had returned to France in June 1794. However, a letter from Toussaint to General Laveaux confirms that he was already fighting officially on the behalf of the French by 18 May 1794.

In the first weeks, Louverture eradicated all Spanish supporters from the &quot;Cordon de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;, which he had held on their behalf. He faced attack from multiple sides. His former colleagues in the slave rebellion were now fighting against him for the Spanish. As a French commander, he was faced with British troops who had landed on Saint-Domingue in September, as the British hoped to take advantage of the ongoing instability to capture the prosperous island. Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who was Secretary of State for War for British prime minister William Pitt the Younger, instructed Sir Adam Williamson, the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, to sign an agreement with representatives of the French colonists that promised to restore the ancien regime, slavery and discrimination against mixed-race colonists, a move that drew criticism from abolitionists William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson.

On the other hand, Louverture was able to pool his 4,000 men with Laveaux&#x27;s troops in joint actions. By now his officers included men who were to remain important throughout the revolution: his brother Paul, his nephew Moïse Hyacinthe, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and Henri Christophe.

Before long, Louverture had put an end to the Spanish threat to French Saint-Domingue. In any case, the Treaty of Basel of July 1795 marked a formal end to hostilities between the two countries. Black leaders Jean-François and Biassou continued to fight against Louverture until November, when they left for Spain and Florida, respectively. At that point, most of their men joined Louverture&#x27;s forces. Louverture also made inroads against the British presence, but was unable to oust them from Saint-Marc. He contained them by resorting to guerilla tactics.

Throughout 1795 and 1796, Louverture was also concerned with re-establishing agriculture and exports, and keeping the peace in areas under his control. In speeches and policy he revealed his belief that the long-term freedom of the people of Saint-Domingue depended on the economic viability of the colony. He was held in general respect, and resorted to a mixture of diplomacy and force to return the field hands to the plantations as emancipated and paid workers. Workers regularly staged small rebellions, protesting poor working conditions, their lack of real freedom, or their fear of a return to slavery. They wanted to establish their own small holdings and work for themselves, rather than on plantations.

Another of Louverture&#x27;s concerns was to manage potential rivals for power within the French part of the colony. The most serious of these was the mulatto commander Jean-Louis Villatte, based in Cap-Français. Louverture and Villate had competed over the command of some sections of troops and territory since 1794. Villatte was thought to be somewhat racist toward black soldiers such as Louverture and planned to ally with André Rigaud, a free man of color, after overthrowing French General Étienne Laveaux. In 1796 Villate drummed up popular support by accusing the French authorities of plotting a return to slavery.

On 20 March, he succeeded in capturing the French Governor Laveaux, and appointed himself Governor. Louverture&#x27;s troops soon arrived at Cap-Français to rescue the captured governor and to drive Villatte out of town. Louverture was noted for opening the warehouses to the public, proving that they were empty of the chains that residents feared had been imported to prepare for a return to slavery. He was promoted to commander of the West Province two months later, and in 1797 was appointed as Saint-Domingue&#x27;s top-ranking officer. Laveaux proclaimed Louverture as Lieutenant Governor, announcing at the same time that he would do nothing without his approval, to which Louverture replied: &quot;After God, Laveaux.&quot;

===Third Commission: 1796–1797===
A few weeks after Louverture&#x27;s triumph over the Villate insurrection, France&#x27;s representatives of the third commission arrived in Saint-Domingue. Among them was Sonthonax, the commissioner who had previously declared abolition of slavery on the same day as Louverture&#x27;s proclamation of Camp Turel. At first the relationship between the two men was positive. Sonthonax promoted Louverture to general and arranged for his sons, Placide and Isaac, who were eleven and fourteen respectively to attend a school in mainland France for the children of colonial officials . This was done to provide them with a formal education in the French language and culture, one that Louverture highly desired for his children, but to also use them as political hostages against Louverture should he act against the will of the central French authority in Paris. In spite of this Placide and Isaac ran away enough times from the school that they were moved to the Collège de la Marche, a division of the old University of Paris. Here in Paris they would regularly dine with members of the French nobility such as Joséphine de Beauharnais, who would go on to become Empress of France as the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte.

In September 1796, elections were held to choose colonial representatives for the French national assembly. Louverture&#x27;s letters show that he encouraged Laveaux to stand, and historians have speculated as to whether he was seeking to place a firm supporter in France or to remove a rival in power. Sonthonax was also elected, either at Louverture&#x27;s instigation or on his own initiative. While Laveaux left Saint-Domingue in October, Sonthonax remained. Sonthonax, a fervent revolutionary and fierce supporter of racial equality, soon rivaled Louverture in popularity. Although their goals were similar, they had several points of conflict. While Louverture was quoted as saying that &quot;&quot;I am black, but I have the soul of a white man&quot; in reference to his self-identification as a Frenchman, loyalty to the French nation, and Catholicism. Sonthonax, who had married a free black woman by this time, countered with &quot;I am white, but I have the soul of a black man&quot;&quot; in reference to his strong abolitionist and secular republican sentiments. They strongly disagreed about accepting the return of the white planters who had fled Saint-Domingue at the start of the revolution. To the ideologically motivated Sonthonax, they were potential counter-revolutionaries who had fled the liberating force of the French Revolution and were forbidden from returning to the colony under pain of death. Louverture on the other hand saw them as wealth generators who could restore the commercial viability of the colony. The planters political and familial connections to Metropolitan France could also foster better diplomatic and economic ties to Europe.

In summer 1797, Louverture authorized the return of Bayon de Libertat, the former overseer of the Bréda plantation, with whom he had shared a close relationship ever since he was enslaved. Sonthonax wrote to Louverture threatening him with prosecution and ordering him to get de Libertat off the island. Louverture went over his head and wrote to the French Directoire directly for permission for de Libertat to stay. Only a few weeks later, he began arranging for Sonthonax&#x27;s return to France that summer. Louverture had several reasons to want to get rid of Sonthonax; officially he said that Sonthonax had tried to involve him in a plot to make Saint-Domingue independent, starting with a massacre of the whites of the island. The accusation played on Sonthonax&#x27;s political radicalism and known hatred of the aristocratic &quot;grands blancs&quot;, but historians have varied as to how credible they consider it.

On reaching France, Sonthonax countered by accusing Louverture of royalist, counter-revolutionary, and pro-independence tendencies. Louverture knew that he had asserted his authority to such an extent that the French government might well suspect him of seeking independence. At the same time, the French Directoire government was considerably less revolutionary than it had been. Suspicions began to brew that it might reconsider the abolition of slavery. In November 1797, Louverture wrote again to the Directoire, assuring them of his loyalty, but reminding them firmly that abolition must be maintained.

===Treaties with Britain and the United States: 1798===
For months, Louverture was in sole command of French Saint-Domingue, except for a semi-autonomous state in the south, where general André Rigaud had rejected the authority of the third commission. Both generals continued harassing the British, whose position on Saint-Domingue was increasingly weak. Louverture was negotiating their withdrawal when France&#x27;s latest commissioner, Gabriel Hédouville, arrived in March 1798, with orders to undermine his authority. Nearing the end of the revolution Louverture grew substantially wealthy; owning numerous slaves at Ennery, obtaining thirty-one properties, and earning almost 300,000 colonial livre per year from these properties. As leader of the revolution, this accumulated wealth made Louverture the richest person on Saint-Domingue. Louverture&#x27;s actions evoked a collective sense of worry among the European powers and the US, who feared that the success of the revolution would inspire slave revolts across the Caribbean, the South American colonies, and the southern United States.

On 30 April 1798, Louverture signed a treaty with British Army officer Thomas Maitland, exchanging the withdrawal of British troops from western Saint-Domingue in return for a general amnesty for the French counter-revolutionaries in those areas. In May, Port-au-Prince was returned to French rule in an atmosphere of order and celebration.

In July, Louverture and Rigaud met commissioner Hédouville together. Hoping to create a rivalry that would diminish Louverture&#x27;s power, Hédouville displayed a strong preference for Rigaud, and an aversion to Louverture. However, General Maitland was also playing on French rivalries and evaded Hédouville&#x27;s authority to deal with Louverture directly. In August, Louverture and Maitland signed treaties for the evacuation of all remaining British troops in Saint-Dominigue. On 31 August, they signed a secret treaty that lifted the British Royal Navy&#x27;s blockade on Saint-Domingue in exchange for a promise that Louverture would not attempt to cause unrest in the British West Indies.

As Louverture&#x27;s relationship with Hédouville reached the breaking point, an uprising began among the troops of his adopted nephew, Hyacinthe Moïse. Attempts by Hédouville to manage the situation made matters worse and Louverture declined to help him. As the rebellion grew to a full-scale insurrection, Hédouville prepared to leave the island, while Louverture and Dessalines threatened to arrest him as a troublemaker. Hédouville sailed for France in October 1798, nominally transferring his authority to Rigaud. Louverture decided instead to work with Phillipe Roume, a member of the third commission who had been posted to the Spanish parts of the colony. Although Louverture continued to protest his loyalty to the French government, he had expelled a second government representative from the territory and was about to negotiate another autonomous agreement with one of France&#x27;s enemies.

The United States had suspended trade with France in 1798 because of increasing tensions between the American and French governments over the issue of privateering. The two countries entered into the so-called &quot;Quasi&quot;-War, but trade between Saint-Domingue and the United States was desirable to both Louverture and the United States. With Hédouville gone, Louverture sent diplomat Joseph Bunel, a &quot;grand blanc&quot; former planter married to a Black Haitian wife, to negotiate with the administration of John Adams. Adams as a New Englander who was openly hostile to slavery was much more sympathetic to the Haitian cause than the Washington administration before and Jefferson after, both of whom came from Southern slave-owning planter backgrounds. The terms of the treaty were similar to those already established with the British, but Louverture continually rebuffed suggestions from either power that he should declare independence. As long as France maintained the abolition of slavery, he appeared to be content to have the colony remain French, at least in name.

===Expansion of territory: 1799–1801===

In 1799, the tensions between Louverture and Rigaud came to a head. Louverture accused Rigaud of trying to assassinate him to gain power over Saint-Domingue. Rigaud claimed Louverture was conspiring with the British to restore slavery. The conflict was complicated by racial overtones that escalated tensions between full blacks and mulattoes. Louverture had other political reasons for eliminating Rigaud; only by controlling every port could he hope to prevent a landing of French troops if necessary.

After Rigaud sent troops to seize the border towns of Petit-Goave and Grand-Goave in June 1799, Louverture persuaded Roume to declare Rigaud a traitor and attacked the southern state. The resulting civil war, known as the War of Knives, lasted more than a year, with the defeated Rigaud fleeing to Guadeloupe, then France, in August 1800. Louverture delegated most of the campaign to his lieutenant, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who became infamous, during and after the war, for massacring mulatto captives and civilians. The number of deaths is contested: the contemporary French general François Joseph Pamphile de Lacroix suggested 10,000 deaths, while the 20th-century Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James claimed there were only a few hundred deaths.

In November 1799, during the civil war, Napoleon Bonaparte gained power in France and passed a new constitution declaring that French colonies would be subject to special laws. Although many Black people in the colonies suspected this meant the re-introduction of slavery, Napoleon began by confirming Louverture&#x27;s position and promising to maintain existing anti-slavery laws. But he also forbade Louverture to invade Spanish Santo Domingo, an action that would put Louverture in a powerful defensive position. Louverture was determined to proceed anyway and coerced Roume into supplying the necessary permission.

At the same time, in order to improve his political relationships with other European powers, Louverture tooks steps to stabilize the political landscape of the Caribbean, which included limiting his anti-slavery sentiments in the interest of &quot;realpolitik&quot;. When Isaac Yeshurun Sasportas, a Sephardic Jewish merchant from Saint-Dominigue, attempted to travel to the British colony of Jamaica to foment a slave rebellion there, Louverture initially supported him; however, as he decided he needed Britain&#x27;s support, Louverture subsequently leaked Sasportas&#x27; intentions to the British authorities in Jamaica, who arrested and hung him in Kingston on December 23, 1799.

In January 1801, Louverture and his nephew, General Hyacinthe Moïse invaded the Spanish territory, taking possession of it from the governor, Don Garcia, with few difficulties. The area had been less developed and populated than the French section. Louverture brought it under French law, abolishing slavery and embarking on a program of modernization. He now controlled the entire island.

===Constitution of 1801===

Napoleon had informed the inhabitants of Saint-Domingue that France would draw up a new constitution for its colonies, in which they would be subjected to special laws. Despite his protestations to the contrary, the former slaves feared that he might restore slavery. In March 1801, Louverture appointed a constitutional assembly, composed chiefly of white planters, to draft a constitution for Saint-Domingue. He promulgated the Constitution on 7 July 1801, officially establishing his authority over the entire island of Hispaniola. It made him governor-general for life with near absolute powers and the possibility of choosing his successor. However, Louverture had not explicitly declared Saint-Domingue&#x27;s independence, acknowledging in Article 1 that it was a single colony of the French Empire.
Article 3 of the constitution states: &quot;There cannot exist slaves [in Saint-Domingue], servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French.&quot; The constitution guaranteed equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law for all races, but confirmed Louverture&#x27;s policies of forced labor and the importation of workers through the slave trade. Identifying as a loyal Christian Frenchman, Louverture was not willing to compromise Catholicism for Vodou, the dominant faith among former slaves. Article 6 states that &quot;the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman faith shall be the only publicly professed faith.&quot; This strong preference for Catholicism went hand in hand with Louverture&#x27;s self-identification of being a Frenchman, and his movement away from associating with Vodou and its origins in the practices of the plantation slaves from Africa.

Louverture charged Colonel Charles Humbert Marie Vincent, who personally opposed the drafted constitution, with the task of delivering it to Napoleon. Several aspects of the constitution were damaging to France: the absence of provision for French government officials, the lack of trade advantages, and Louverture&#x27;s breach of protocol in publishing the constitution before submitting it to the French government. Despite his disapproval, Vincent attempted to submit the constitution to Napoleon but was briefly exiled to the Mediterranean island of Elba for his pains.

Louverture identified as a Frenchman and strove to convince Bonaparte of his loyalty. He wrote to Napoleon, but received no reply. Napoleon eventually decided to send an expedition of 20,000 men to Saint-Domingue to restore French authority, and possibly, to restore slavery as well. Given the fact that France had signed a temporary truce with Great Britain in the Treaty of Amiens, Napoleon was able to plan this operation without the risk of his ships being intercepted by the Royal Navy.

===Leclerc&#x27;s campaign: 1801–1802===

Napoleon&#x27;s troops, under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Emmanuel Leclerc, were directed to seize control of the island by diplomatic means, proclaiming peaceful intentions, and keep secret his orders to deport all black officers. Meanwhile, Louverture was preparing for defense and ensuring discipline. This may have contributed to a rebellion against forced labor led by his nephew and top general, Moïse, in October 1801. Because the activism was violently repressed, when the French ships arrived, not all of Saint-Domingue supported Louverture. In late January 1802, while Leclerc sought permission to land at Cap-Français and Christophe held him off, the Vicomte de Rochambeau suddenly attacked Fort-Liberté, effectively quashing the diplomatic option. Christophe had written to Leclerc: &quot;you will only enter the city of Cap, after having watched it reduced to ashes. And even upon these ashes, I will fight you.&quot;

Louverture&#x27;s plan in case of war was to burn the coastal cities and as much of the plains as possible, retreat with his troops into the inaccessible mountains, and wait for yellow fever to decimate the French. The biggest impediment to this plan proved to be difficulty in internal communications. Christophe burned Cap-Français and retreated, but Paul Louverture was tricked by a false letter into allowing the French to occupy Santo Domingo. Other officers believed Napoleon&#x27;s diplomatic proclamation, while some attempted resistance instead of burning and retreating.

With both sides shocked by the violence of the initial fighting, Leclerc tried belatedly to revert to the diplomatic solution. Louverture&#x27;s sons and their tutor had been sent from France to accompany the expedition with this end in mind and were now sent to present Napoleon&#x27;s proclamation to Louverture. When these talks broke down, months of inconclusive fighting followed.

This ended when Christophe, ostensibly convinced that Leclerc would not re-institute slavery, switched sides in return for retaining his generalship in the French military. General Jean-Jacques Dessalines did the same shortly later. On 6 May 1802, Louverture rode into Cap-Français and negotiated an acknowledgement of Leclerc&#x27;s authority in return for an amnesty for him and his remaining generals. Louverture was then forced to capitulate and placed under house arrest on his property in Ennery.

=== Arrest, imprisonment, and death: 1802–1803 ===

Jean-Jacques Dessalines was at least partially responsible for Louverture&#x27;s arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture&#x27;s son, Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote to Leclerc to denounce Louverture&#x27;s conduct as &quot;extraordinary&quot;. For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from Jean Baptiste Brunet.

Leclerc originally asked Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. Jean Baptiste Brunet was ordered to do so, but accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One version said that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in Saint-Domingue and was asking Louverture&#x27;s advice about plantation management. Louverture&#x27;s memoirs, however, suggest that Brunet&#x27;s troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him. Either way, Louverture had a letter, in which Brunet described himself as a &quot;sincere friend&quot;, to take with him to France. Embarrassed about his trickery, Brunet absented himself during the arrest.

Finally on June 7, 1802, despite the promises made in exchange for his surrender, Toussaint Louverture – as well as a hundred members of his inner circle – were captured and deported to France. Brunet transported Louverture and his companions on the frigate &quot;Créole&quot; and the 74-gun &quot;Héros&quot;, claiming that he suspected the former leader of plotting another uprising. Upon boarding &quot;Créole&quot;, Toussaint Louverture warned his captors that the rebels would not repeat his mistake, saying that, &quot;In overthrowing me you have cut down in Saint Domingue only the trunk of the tree of liberty; it will spring up again from the roots, for they are numerous and they are deep.&quot;

The ships reached France on 2 July 1802 and, on 25 August, Louverture was imprisoned at Fort-de-Joux in Doubs. During this time, Louverture wrote a memoir. He died in prison on 7 April 1803 at the age of 59. Suggested causes of death include exhaustion, malnutrition, apoplexy, pneumonia, and possibly tuberculosis.

== Views and stances ==

===Religion and spirituality===
Throughout his life, Louverture was known as a devout Roman Catholic. Having been baptized into the church as a slave by the Jesuits, Louverture would go on to be one of the few slaves on the Bréda plantation to be labeled devout. He celebrated Mass every day when possible, regularly served as godfather at multiple slave baptisms, and constantly quizzed others on the catechism of the church. In 1763 the Jesuits were expelled for spreading Catholicism among the slaves and undermining planter propaganda that slaves were mentally inferior. Toussaint would grow closer to the Capuchin Order that succeeded them in 1768, especially as they did not own plantations like the Jesuits. Louverture would also go on to have two formal Catholic weddings to both of his wives once freed. In his memoirs he fondly recounted the weekly ritual his family had on Sundays of going to church and enjoying a communal meal.

Although spending most of his life as a member of the Catholic faith, Louverture&#x27;s early life included aspects of the Vodou religion. Vodou was common among slaves in Saint-Dominque as it was passed down through black communities of Allada origin. Characteristics of the Vodou belief include a link between spirits and herbs used for medicine. Historian and author Sudhir Hazareesingh writes: &quot;Toussaint undoubtably made this connection, and drew upon the magical recipes of sorcerers in his practice of natural medicine&quot;. Louverture was regarded as a doctor for some time during his travels across the colony which aided in his process of generating a following among those in Saint-Dominque in the earlier years of Louverture&#x27;s adult life.

After defeating forces led by André Rigaud in the War of the Knives, Louverture consolidated his power by decreeing a new constitution for the colony in 1801. It established Catholicism as the official religion. Although Vodou was generally practiced on Saint-Domingue in combination with Catholicism, little is known for certain if Louverture had any connection with it. Officially as ruler of Saint-Domingue, he discouraged its practice and eventually persecuted its followers.

Historians have suggested that he was a member of high degree of the Masonic Lodge of Saint-Domingue, mostly based on a Masonic symbol he used in his signature. The memberships of several free blacks and white men close to him have been confirmed.

==Legacy==

In his absence, Jean-Jacques Dessalines led the Haitian rebellion until its completion, finally defeating the French forces in 1803; this officially ended the only slave rebellion in world history which successfully established an independent nation. Dessalines promulgated the Declaration of Independence in 1804, declared himself emperor, and renamed the nation &quot;Ayiti&quot; after the indigenous Taíno name. Along with Dessalines, Louverture is now known as one of the &quot;Fathers of Haiti&quot;.

John Brown claimed influence by Louverture in his plans to invade Harpers Ferry. During the 19th century, African Americans referred to Louverture as an example of how to reach freedom.

On 29 August 1954, the Haitian ambassador to France, Léon Thébaud, inaugurated a stone cross memorial for Toussaint Louverture at the foot of Fort de Joux. Years afterward, the French government ceremoniously presented a shovelful of soil from the grounds of Fort de Joux to the Haitian government as a symbolic transfer of Louverture&#x27;s remains. An inscription in his memory was installed in 1998 on the wall of the Panthéon in Paris. His desire for personal power, the expulsion of Sonthonax, and his rehabilitation of the white planters have all attracted historical criticism.

The making of his legacy was also in the notion that he was devoted to his military leadership strategies and etiquette, that was looked upon with great attachment to the officers in his military command, as Sudhir Hazareesingh, author of Black Spartacus, says, “The absolute dedication Toussaint expected of his soldiers on the battlefield was more than exemplified by their commander. He was the epitome of the charismatic military leader: a model of sobriety; he slept only a few hours every night, drank no alcohol, and his capacity for physical endurance was greater than even the hardiest of men.” (Hazareesingh pg.72)

=== Family ===
The youngest child of Toussaint and Suzanne, Saint-Jean Toussaint, was affected by the death of his father, and died in 1804 in Agen. His wife, Suzanne, underwent torture from French soldiers until Toussaint&#x27;s death, and was deported to Jamaica, where she died on May 19, 1816, in the arms of their surviving sons, Placide and Isaac. Both surviving brothers returned to France. In 1831, Placide married Joséphine de Lacaze, heiress to the Château du Parc (in Astaffort, near Agen), with whom he had three children, Armand, Joseph and Rose (1823–1900). Of the three, only Rose lived to adulthood.

<text>The Jasmund National Park (German: &quot;Nationalpark Jasmund&quot;) is a nature reserve on the Jasmund peninsula, in the northeast of Rügen island in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is famous for containing the largest Rügen chalk cliffs in Germany, the highest of which is &quot;Königsstuhl&quot; (German = &quot;king&#x27;s chair&quot;), rising to above the Baltic Sea. The highest point in the park as a whole is Pieckberg, at above sea level. The beech forests behind the cliffs are also part of the national park.

Consisting of only , this is the smallest national park in Germany. The park was founded in September 1990 by the last government of East Germany (GDR) prior to the German reunification.

On 25 June 2011 the beech forest in the park was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as an extension of the Primeval Beech Forests of Europe site because of its undisturbed nature and its testimony to the ecological history of Europe since the last Ice Age.

== Geography ==
The Jasmund National Park includes the ridge of the Stubnitz north of the city of Sassnitz. The ridge is covered with primeval beech forest and the cliffs (2200 ha), also a 500-meter spanning water corridor towards the Baltic Sea (603 ha) and 200 ha in the West, with the former Quoltitz chalk quarries, meadows, moors and dry grasslands.

==Chalk cliffs==
The cliffs of Jasmund National Park belong to the Rügen Chalk unit. The chalk cliffs face constant erosion. With every storm, parts of the cliffs fall, including rocks and fossils of sponges, oysters and sea urchins.

The most majestic part of the cliffs is the &quot;Königsstuhl&quot; (English: king&#x27;s chair) which stands at . One of the most scenic and best known of the chalk outcrops, the &quot;Wissower Klinken&quot;, collapsed into the Baltic Sea on 24 February 2005, in a landslide caused by spring-thaw weather conditions.

==Flora and fauna==
Because of the special geological characteristics of the Jasmund National Park, it is home to many rare plants and animals.

In the woods of the Stubnitz, behind the cliffs, there are numerous water-filled dells and hollows, most of which came into existence as ice-age dead-ice holes. A wide range of plants is found in this area, for example, black alder, European crab apple, wild service tree, yew and orchids (such as &quot;Cypripedium calceolus&quot;).

A variety of birds lives in the park, including white-tailed eagles, common kingfishers, house martins and peregrine falcons.

== Management ==
Since its creation in 1934, the Jasmund National Park has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. One of the main tasks of the National Park Authority is to ensure that the diverse habitats of the park remain largely undisturbed, whilst still allowing visitors an insight into the nature of the region. In March 2004, the visitor centre, the Königsstuhl National Park Centre, was opened.

<text>The Forestry Commission is a non-ministerial government department responsible for the management of publicly owned forests and the regulation of both public and private forestry in England.

The Forestry Commission was previously also responsible for Forestry in Wales and Scotland. However, on 1 April 2013, Forestry Commission Wales merged with other agencies to become Natural Resources Wales, whilst two new bodies (Forestry and Land Scotland and Scottish Forestry) were established in Scotland on 1 April 2019.

The Forestry Commission was established in 1919 to expand Britain&#x27;s forests and woodland, which had been severely depleted during the First World War. The Commission bought large amounts of agricultural land on behalf of the state, eventually becoming the largest manager of land in Britain. Today, the Forestry Commission is divided into three divisions: Forestry England, Forestry Commission and Forest Research.
Over time the purpose of the Commission broadened to include many other activities beyond timber production. One major activity is scientific research, some of which is carried out in research forests across Britain. Recreation is also important, with several outdoor activities being actively promoted. Protecting and improving biodiversity across England&#x27;s forests are also part of the Forestry Commission&#x27;s remit.

The Commission received criticism for its reliance on conifers, particularly the uniform appearance of conifer forests and concerns over a lack of biodiversity. Furious protests from the general public and conservation groups accompanied attempts to privatise the organisation in 1993 and 2010.

== Role ==
Before the setting up of separate bodies for Scotland the Forestry Commission managed almost 700,000 hectares (about 1.7 million acres) of land in England and Scotland, making it the country&#x27;s biggest land manager. The majority of the land (70%) was in Scotland, 30% of the landholding is in England. Activities carried out on the forest estate include maintenance and improvement of the natural environment and the provision of recreation, timber harvesting to supply domestic industry, regenerating brownfield and replanting of harvested areas.

Deforestation was the main reason for the creation of the commission in 1919. Britain had only 5% of its original forest cover left and the government at that time wanted to create a strategic resource of timber. Since then forest coverage has doubled and the commission&#x27;s remit expanded to include greater focus on sustainable forest management and maximising public benefits. Woodland creation continues to be an important role of the commission, however, and works closely with government to achieve its goal of 12% forest coverage by 2060, championing initiatives such as The Big Tree Plant and Woodland Carbon Code.

The Forestry Commission is also the government body responsible for the regulation of private forestry in England; felling is generally illegal without first obtaining a licence from the Commission. The Commission is also responsible for encouraging new private forest growth and development. Part of this role is carried out by providing grants in support of private forests and woodlands.

== History ==

The Forestry Commission was established as part of the Forestry Act 1919. The board was initially made up of eight forestry commissioners and was chaired by Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat from 1919 to 1927. The commission was set up to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for afforestation and reforestation. The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade. During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. During the Great Depression the Forestry Commission&#x27;s estate continued to grow so that it was just over 360,000 hectares of land by 1934. The low cost of land, and the need to increase timber production meant that by 1939 the Forestry Commission was the largest landowner in Britain.

At the outbreak of the Second World War the Forestry Commission was split into the Forest Management Department, to continue with the commission&#x27;s duties, and the Timber Supply Department to produce enough timber for the war effort. This division lasted until 1941, when the Timber Supply Department was absorbed by the Ministry of Supply. Much of the timber supplied for the war came from the New Forest and the Forest of Dean. The war also saw the commission introduce the licensing system for tree felling. By the end of the war approximately a third of available timber had been cut down and used.

The advisory committee on Forest Research was formed in 1929 to guide the research efforts of the Forestry Commission. After the war, the commission began to increase its research output significantly. This included the establishment of three research stations beginning with Alice Holt Lodge in 1946. The expansion in research accompanied a significant increase in timber sales, exceeding £2 million per year during the 1950s.

The Countryside Act 1968 required public bodies, including the Forestry Commission, to &quot;have regard to the desirability of conserving the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside.&quot; This forced the commission to focus on conservation and recreation as well as the production and sale of timber. The conservation effort was partly driven by Peter Garthwaite and Sylvia Crowe. Crowe also helped the Forestry Commission landscape their forests to make them more appropriate for recreational use.
Having begun to develop campsites within their forests during the early 1960s, the commission set up a Forest Cabins Branch during the 1970s to expand the number of cabins available for the public to stay in during their holidays. In 1970 the commission opened its Northern research station in Roslin. The 1970s also saw the publication of a Treasury report which stated &quot;afforestation ... and replanting fell far short of achieving the official 10% return on investment&quot; with concerns over the long term profitability of timber production. This was coupled with a major outbreak of Dutch elm disease throughout the decade.

The early 1980s recession forced the Forestry Commission to expand its sales beyond Britain, exports quickly reached 500,000 tonnes of timber per year. The Forestry Act 1981 allowed the sale of Commission land that was used for forestry. By 1986 there were calls for the full privatisation of the Forestry Commission and its estate. Meanwhile, the Wildlife and Countryside (Amendment) Act 1985 had imposed a duty on the Forestry Commissioners to endeavour to achieve a &quot;reasonable balance&quot; the interests of timber production and conservation. The Great Storm of 1987 caused significant damage to forests under the control of the Commission, though most of the downed trees were recovered and eventually sold.

The early 1990s saw the Department of Forestry absorb the Forest Authority from the commission, which had previously acted as a separate government department. The management of the forest estate became the responsibility of Forest Enterprise, making up a major part of the reduced Forestry Commission. In 1993 it was again suggested that the Forestry Commission could be privatised, sparking protest from many conservation groups. After the Forestry Review Group produced their report in 1994, it was announced by the government that &quot;Forestry Commission woodlands will remain in the public sector&quot;.

The decline in timber sales since the mid-1990s forced the Commission to focus on research and recreation more than ever before, something that was encouraged by the government. As a result the Forestry Commission began to expand woodland around urban areas for the first time.

Devolution meant the Forestry Commission had to report to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly as well as the national Government. This was achieved by splitting responsibility for forests by national borders, resulting in the creation of Forestry Commission England, Scotland and Wales as sub-departments of the Forestry Commission of Great Britain. On 1 April 2013 Forestry Commission Wales was merged into Natural Resources Wales: between that date and April 2019 the Forestry Commission was responsible only for English and Scottish forests.

In October 2010, the government introduced the Public Bodies Bill to the House of Lords, which would have enabled the Secretary of State to sell or lease public forests in England. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;the news [was] met with near-universal disgust and shock&quot;. The same newspaper also quoted Caroline Lucas MP, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, as saying it was an &quot;unforgivable act of environmental vandalism&quot;. An online petition opposing the sale received more than 500,000 signatories. In February 2011, after a sustained campaign of protest by groups such as the Ramblers, Save Our Woods and Hands off our Forest, the government announced it had abandoned its current plans and would remove the forestry clauses from the Public Bodies Bill. An &#x27;independent panel&#x27; was also established to advise on the future direction of forestry and woodland policy in England, and on the role of the Forestry Commission. The panel&#x27;s interim report in late 2011 suggested that the government had ignored the benefits of publicly owned forests.

Due to austerity policies enacted in the UK from 2010 the Forestry Commission, like many government bodies, suffered a considerable cut in its budget to meet its running costs, despite buoyant timber production, recreation usage and revenue. There have been considerable jobs losses in some sections, starting with 450 job losses in 2011. Employee salaries were effectively frozen in 2011, with progression pay being removed, and the bottom of pay scales becoming the standard rate for the job. This has created a wide variation in salaries for employees doing the same job and has reduced wage competitiveness, compared to some forestry employers. However, other government departments in Scotland and Northern Ireland have continued to honour progression pay. This has created some retention and recruitment problems, particularly for professions such as forestry management and IT.

Forestry Commission Wales () was separated from Forestry Commission on 1 April 2013, and merged with Environment Agency Wales and Countryside Council for Wales to create Natural Resources Wales, a single body delivering the environmental priorities of the Welsh Government. This move was controversial among forestry officials, with worries that the industry&#x27;s voice will not be adequately heard in the new organisation. Two new bodies (Forestry and Land Scotland and Scottish Forestry) were established in Scotland on 1 April 2019 to take over the commission&#x27;s responsibilities in Scotland.

===The Forestry Commission&#x27;s social concern===

Integral to the Acland Report of 1916, which led to the setting up of the Forestry Commission immediately after the war, was the wider social concern. Large areas of upland Britain, it pointed out, were &#x27;waste&#x27; and depopulated, and trees would not only increase their productiveness but &#x27;demanded a higher rural population&#x27; than sheep rearing. They envisaged that &#x27;the small holdings will be grouped together on the best land within or near the forests so as to economise labour in the working of the holdings, ... and to provide an ample supply of ... labour for [forestry] work. Families settled on new holdings in forest areas will be a net addition to the resident rural population&#x27;.

This remained the philosophy of the commission for nearly fifty years. In 1946 the incoming Director General wrote of the employment created and the help of the commission towards a solution of &#x27;one of the baffling social problems of our time... to draw men and their families &quot;back to the land&quot; and to make the attraction permanent&#x27;, especially through the smallholdings policy.

Lord Lovat, the &#x27;Father&#x27; of the Forestry Commission, had extensive land holdings in Scotland, and it was in the Highlands that he and other Scottish landowners such as Sir John Stirling-Maxwell conceived of the scheme of land-settlement allied to forestry. As first chairman of the commission he was able to put into practice all over Britain this &#x27;long cherished dream&#x27; of repopulating hill country, thanks to his good contacts in government. Money for the scheme was provided first by Philip Snowden, Chancellor in the first Labour government, and then by his successor in Baldwin&#x27;s Conservative administration, Winston Churchill.

The scheme accordingly went ahead and created smallholdings in the new forests, of approximately ten acres, let for £15 a year. Originally 150 days&#x27; work was provided in the forests, but &quot;in practice, of course, these smallholdings attracted the cream of our men whom we were glad to employ on full time...&quot; Existing and often derelict agricultural dwellings were adapted and new ones built to a small number of basic designs. The scheme &quot;was never a directly economic proposition, but in the pre-war days when motor traffic was lacking and it was much more important than today to have a solid caucus of skilled woodmen living in the forests, the indirect benefits were inestimable. The holdings were a great success, and filled a genuine need in the countryside...&quot;

The number of smallholdings built slowed down after the Great Depression, was revived by the Special Areas programme of 1934 onwards, but then was virtually ended by the Second World War. The total number of smallholdings was 1,511. After 1945 policy shifted to the building of houses without holdings. This was more economic for the Commission, and numbers of these peaked in 1955, with 2,688 cottages built by then. The smallholdings policy had been &#x27;adequate during the early years of State forest development, when only a small nucleus of men was needed to plant and tend each forest. But expanding programmes of afforestation, new methods of fire protection, and above all the greatly increased volume of utilisation work that results as soon as the young woods reach the thinning stage, have made it essential, in most of the larger forests, to concentrate the building of new houses in villages or small community groups.&#x27; With houses designed for head foresters, the peak year for all forest tenancies was 1958, with the Commission owning a total of 4,627 properties.

Many of the more ambitious forest villages were never completed, partly because of their isolation, partly through financial restrictions, and partly because mechanisation, transport improvements, and more use of contract labour, all meant there was less need for staff houses. The social desirability of &quot;company villages&quot; in remote locations was questioned.

Some houses had been sold on the open market by 1972, when government policy encouraged the disposal of &#x27;surplus&#x27; land and buildings. The gradual sale of housing to incomers became a flood in 1978-9 (under Labour), and the Thatcher administration then encouraged surviving tenants to buy with generous discounts.

Although the social policy of the Forestry Commission is a thing of the past, its social impact on upland areas remains large, with many hamlets and small villages in what would otherwise be deserted or near-deserted valleys.

== Organisational structure ==

The Forestry Commission is governed by a Board of Commissioners made up of a chairperson and up to ten Forestry Commissioners. The current chairman is Sir William Worsley. The Chief Executive, Richard Stanford, is also one of these commissioners. Forestry Commissioners are appointed by the King. An Executive Board works with the Commissioners to handle the strategic management of the Forestry Commission.

The Forestry Commission is organised into Forest Services, Forestry England and Forest Research.

=== Devolution ===
In 2003, forestry policy and the management of state forests was devolved to each of the three national Administrations in Great Britain, and separate bodies have since been established for Wales (Natural Resources Wales in 2013) and Scotland (Scottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland in 2019). The Forestry Commission continues to report to the Westminster Parliament via Defra ministers. However the devolved organisations continue to collaborate on a number of cross-border arrangements: Scottish Forestry is responsible for management of the UK Forestry Standard and the Woodland Carbon Code and for provision of economic advice on forestry, Natural Resources Wales originally co-ordinated the commissioning of research into forestry but this role has now passed to Scottish Forestry, and the Forestry Commission continues to be responsible on behalf of the whole of the UK for coordinating international forestry policy support and certain plant health functions in respect of trees and forestry. Forest Research, a separate executive agency of the Forestry Commissioners, also continues to provide research and evidence capabilities across the UK.

=== Forest Research ===

Forest Research is the research agency of the Forestry Commission that undertakes scientific research and surveys. Its core roles are to provide the evidence base for British forestry policies and to identify methods for sustainable forestry management. It also carries out research with, or on behalf of, academic and commercial organisations.

There are three forest research stations run by Forest Research. A research station is located in each of the constituent countries of Great Britain: Alice Holt in Hampshire in England; the Northern research station in Scotland and the smaller Aberystwyth Research Unit in Wales. The Alice Holt research station was the Commission&#x27;s first research station, established in 1946; it is the main research station of Forest Research. The Northern research station in Midlothian was opened in 1970. In 2009, a smaller research unit was established in Aberystwyth.

Forest Research Technical Services Unit is run from the Northern Research Station and maintains a network of five field stations to conduct research for the Forestry Commission and other organisations. The Technical Services Unit is also responsible for six satellite stations and the research station nurseries.

In 2006, Forest Research made Alice Holt forest the first research forest in Britain. It was followed by the Dyfi Catchment and Woodland Research Platform, Gwynedd, in 2012. Alice Holt was chosen as a research forest because it has been the base for research by the Forestry Commission since 1946 and over that time the Commission maintained detailed records of the forest and experiments carried out within it.

== Recreation ==
Until the introduction of the Countryside Act 1968, the main purpose of the Forestry Commission was to maximise timber sales. The act gave the public the right to use much of the forest estate for recreation, this led to the commission providing additional facilities for the public. Sylvia Crowe was hired as a consultant to identify how to improve the landscape of commission forests for recreation. The focus on recreation allowed the Forestry Commission to become the largest provider of outdoor recreation in Britain.

The commission works with various associations involved in rambling, cycling and horse riding to promote the use of its land for recreation. A notable example is the 7stanes project in southern Scotland, where seven purpose-built areas of man-made mountain bike trails have been laid; the accessible extensions provide recreational facilities for disabled cyclists. During the summer months, it hosts a series of live music concerts across seven forests.

== Biodiversity ==
Early plantations were criticised for their lack of diversity, however the Forestry Commission has been steadily improving the value of its woodlands for wildlife. The large blocks of conifer associated with the earlier plantings were beneficial to some species such as Eurasian siskin, goldcrest, red crossbill, most members of the tit family, long-eared owl, European nightjar, roe deer, pine marten and polecat, but the greater emphasis on diversity now favours a much wider range of species, including broadleaved and open ground specialist species.

== Forests ==

26% of the UK woodland (0.86 million hectares) is managed by Forestry England, Forestry and Land Scotland, Natural Resources Wales or the Northern Ireland Forest service.

When the Forestry Commission was founded in 1919 it inherited responsibility for several forests, some of which were former royal forests and contained ancient woodland. Much of the land bought by the Commission in its early years was intensively planted with conifers. Kielder Forest was one of these &quot;new&quot; developments, having been planted in 1926, and is the now the largest forest in England. It is managed by Forestry England. 

The early reliance on conifers, usually of the same age class and very dark in appearance, led to criticism that the forests appeared too artificial. The Commission was originally given land with poor soil quality, usually in highland areas; conifers were used because they can grow well in such difficult conditions. By the 1960s these trees were almost fully grown, and the Forestry Commission received a large number of complaints that their blanket forests were an eyesore.

Since then, landscape improvement has been a key feature of the Forestry Commission&#x27;s work. All forests are covered by a Forest Design Plan (Forest Resource Plan in Wales), which aims to balance the different objectives of timber production, landscape amelioration, ecological restoration, recreation provision and other relevant objectives. Forest management is a long-term business, with plans frequently extending for a minimum of twenty-five or thirty years into the future.

<text>Kirkcudbright ( ; ) is a town at the mouth of the River Dee in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, southwest of Castle Douglas and Dalbeattie. A former royal burgh, it is the traditional county town of Kirkcudbrightshire.

==History==
An early rendition of the name of the town was Kilcudbrit; this derives from the Gaelic &quot;Cille Chuithbeirt&quot; meaning &quot;chapel of Cuthbert&quot;, the saint whose mortal remains were kept at the town between their exhumation at Lindisfarne and reinterment at Chester-le-Street.

John Spottiswoode, in his account of religious houses in Scotland, mentions that the Franciscans, or Grey Friars, had been established at Kirkcudbright from the 12th century.

John Balliol was in possession of the ancient castle at Castledykes in the late 13th century and Edward I of England is said to have stayed here in 1300 during his war against Scotland.

In 1455 Kirkcudbright became a royal burgh. About a century later, the magistrates of the town obtained permission from Queen Mary to use part of the convent and nunnery as a parish church. From around 1570, Sir Thomas MacLellan of Bombie, the chief magistrate, received a charter for the site, its grounds and gardens. MacLellan dismantled the church in order to obtain material for his new castle, a very fine house, which was built on the site.

After defeat at the Battle of Towton, Henry VI of England crossed the Solway Firth in August 1461 to land at Kirkcudbright before joining his wife Queen Margaret in exile at Linlithgow. The town for some time withstood a siege in 1547 from the English commander Sir Thomas Carleton but, after the surrounding countryside had been overrun, was compelled to surrender.
Kirkcudbright Tolbooth was built between 1625 and 1629 and served not only as the tolbooth, but also the council offices, the burgh and sheriff courts, the criminal prison and the debtors&#x27; prison. One of the most famous prisoners was John Paul Jones, founder of the United States Navy, who was born in Kirkbean. The Tolbooth was superseded as the county&#x27;s main administrative building by a new courthouse at 85 High Street, built in 1788 and rebuilt in 1868, which then served as the meeting place of Kirkcudbrightshire County Council from its creation in 1890 until 1952 when the council moved its meeting place to County Buildings.
The Johnston School was one of the town&#x27;s two primary schools, until it was merged with Castledykes Primary School in 2009, the new School called Kirkcudbright Primary School being housed in a new building. The school was endowed with a bequest by Kirkcudbright merchant and shipowner William Johnston (1769–1845) and opened in 1847 as Johnston&#x27;s Free School. The building was designed by Edinburgh architect James Newlands (1813–1871) who later went on to be the first Borough Engineer for Liverpool where he designed and built the first integrated sewerage system in the world in 1848. The school building was rebuilt, retaining the Italianate tower and façade in 1933 by William A MacKinnell, (1871–1940). He was the County Architect for Kirkcudbrightshire and built many schools in the Stewartry. In 2020 the building was refurbished as a Community Activity and Resource Centre. The building is Listed Category B.

St Andrew&#x27;s and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church was designed in 1886 by London architect A. E. Purdie (1843–1920), in the Gothic style. It was built on the site of the medieval St Andrew&#x27;s Church. In 1971 the interior was re-ordered and stripped of its Victorian fixtures and fittings and now features an abstract concrete and iron cross by the Liverpool sculptor Sean Rice (1931–1997), modern stained glass by the Polish artist Jerzy Faczynski (1917–1994) and a set of four paintings by Vivien K. Chapman depicting The Passion of Christ.

The Kirkcudbright Railway opened in 1864 but the railway line and station closed in 1965.
Kirkcudbright Town Hall was designed by architects Peddie and Kinnear. It was completed in 1879 and is a Category B listed building. It has since been converted into the Kirkcudbright Galleries, a new facility which was opened by the Princess Royal on 12 July 2018.

The war memorial dates from 1921 and was created by the sculptor George Henry Paulin.

=== Training area ===
Like many other remote areas during the Second World War, a area to the southeast of the town and extending to the coast of the Solway Firth, was acquired by the Army in 1942, as a training area for the D-Day invasion. The area remains in active use for live-firing exercises. Part of the training area is the Dundrennan Range, a weapons development and testing range. The use of this range for the testing of depleted uranium shells has been controversial. The range also contains a surviving A39 Tortoise heavy assault tank.

===Museums===
Broughton House is an 18th-century town house standing on the High Street. It was the home of Scots impressionist artist Edward Atkinson Hornel between 1901 and his death in 1933. The National Trust for Scotland maintain the house and its contents as a museum of Hornel&#x27;s life and work.

The Stewartry Museum was founded in 1879 and was at first based in the Town Hall until it became too small to house the collections. The collection moved to a purpose-built site. It contains the local and natural history of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. Britain&#x27;s earliest surviving sporting trophy, the Siller Gun, is part of the collection.

The Tolbooth building is now used as an arts centre.

==Art==
Kirkcudbright has for long been a centre for visual artists and is now known as &quot;the Artists&#x27; Town&quot;. The main routes into the town include brown tourist signs saying &quot;Artists&#x27; Town&quot;.

Kirkcudbright is home to an artists&#x27; collective which has a shop in the town centre, The PA, Professional Artists Collective. Wasps (Workshop &amp; Artists Studio Provision Scotland) occupy two linked townhouses, Canonwalls and Claverhouse, in the High Street. It is also a centre in which many artists open their studios during Spring Fling Open Studios.

The Kirkcudbright Arts &amp; Crafts Trail takes place every summer. This four-day event, finishing on the first Monday in August, allows visitors to see artists&#x27; studios and visit places that are normally off-limits to visitors.

===Galleries===
Galleries in Kirkcudbright include Kirkcudbright Galleries, in the former Town Hall on St Mary Street, and the Harbour Cottage Gallery.

===Cinema and literature===

The 1907 novel Little Esson by S. R. Crockett is a romantic mystery involving the artistic community of Kirkcudbright. The title character Archibald Esson is a fictionalised version of William Stewart MacGeorge, Crockett&#x27;s boyhood friend. 
The later whodunit &quot;Five Red Herrings&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers also involves the artistic community of Kirkcudbright. In 1975, the book was made into a BBC TV drama series shot in the town, with Ian Carmichael playing the lead role of Lord Peter Wimsey.

The town also provided locations for the cult 1973 horror film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.

Robert Urquhart starred in a 1980 BBC adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, shot on location in Kirkcudbright.

===Music===
Matt McGinn wrote and recorded &quot;The Wee Kirkcudbright Centipede&quot; which has also been covered by other singers including Alistair McDonald on disc and on his BBC Scotland show &quot;Songs of Scotland&quot;, which included a segment filmed on location at the town&#x27;s Johnston Primary School where McDonald led the children in a dance sequence.

Also among those who moved here from Glasgow were Edward Hornel, George Henry and Jessie M. King. Later another small group of Glasgow-trained artists built their studios across the river at The Stell, including John Charles Lamont and Robert Sivell. Landscape painter Charles Oppenheimer moved to Kirkcudbright in 1908. He is given credit along with artist Dorothy Nesbitt for protecting the Harbour Cottage (art) Gallery from demolition in 1956.

<text>Cape Arkona (), also spelled Arcona, is a 45-metre (150-foot) high cape on the island of Rügen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It forms the tip of the Wittow peninsula, just a few kilometres north of the Jasmund National Park. The protected landscape of Cape Arkona, together with the fishing village of Vitt, belongs to the municipality of Putgarten and is one of the most popular tourist destinations on Rügen, receiving about 800,000 visitors annually.

On the cape there are two lighthouses, a navigation tower, two military bunker complexes, the Slavic temple fortress of &quot;Jaromarsburg&quot; and several tourist buildings (restaurants, pubs and souvenir shops).

Because of its geology and the weathering that occurs here, there are frequent coastal collapses, especially in winter.

Cape Arkona is often referred to as &quot;the northernmost point of Rügen&quot;, which is not true. Approximately one kilometre to the north-west, there is a point on the steep coast, known as the &quot;Gellort&quot;, which is a little further north. Directly at the foot of the Gellort is a 165-ton glacial erratic boulder known as the &quot;Siebenschneiderstein&quot; (Low German: &quot;Söbenschniedersteen&quot;). The cape offers a view of the island, both from land or sea.

== Lighthouses and navigation tower ==

The smaller of the two lighthouses was built of brick in 1826/27 based on plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and taken into service in 1828. It is 19.3 metres high and has a focal height of . The rooms of the three-storey tower are used as operating and storage rooms. It is also called the &quot;Schinkelturm&quot; (&quot;Schinkel Tower&quot;). On 31 March 1905 it was taken out of service. It is the second oldest lighthouse on the German Baltic Sea coast after the Travemünde Lighthouse.
The largest tower was built in 1901/02 right next to the old tower and entered service on 1 April 1905. It is 35 metres high and has a focal height of . It is made of brick and stands on an octagonal granite base. For 90 years its light source was two arc lamps, but they were replaced in 1995 by a Metal-halide lamp. This, combined with the rotating triple optics, emits 3 flashes every 17 seconds.

The old naval navigation tower (German: &quot;Peilturm&quot;) was built in 1927 of brick and acted as a marine navigation beacon. From 1911 to 1925, attempts were made - which were ground-breaking for that time - to improve navigation for the Sassnitz-Trelleborg railway ferry, established in 1909, using the emission of radio waves. The foundations of the associated radio operating facility inside the ramparts have survived to this day. The technical facilities of the navigation tower were destroyed, however, in 1945

All three towers were renovated in the early 1990s and are open to visitors. In the old lighthouse, there is now a museum and a branch of the registry office. Marriages may be commemorated here on a small plaque in the ground in front of the tower. The navigation tower is used as an art museum and studio. On each tower there is a viewing platform from which there are unobstructed views of Rügen and especially the peninsula of Wittow. In clear weather you can even see as far as the Danish island of Møn.

== Jaromarsburg ==


From the 9th to the 12th centuries, the Jaromarsburg was a cult site for the Rani, a Slavic tribe, which was dedicated to their god Svantevit. Located at the tip of the cape, it was protected on three sides by cliffs and from the land side by a 25-metre-high burgwall. The temple located within the ramparts grew in importance as a religious centre for the Slavs of Mecklenburg after the destruction of Rethra in 1068. In 1168, the Danish king Valdemar I conquered Rügen which then became Christian. Churches were established and the castle and its temple destroyed.

At the tip of Arkona in recent centuries, the cliffs have repeatedly collapsed into the sea, with the result that only the ramparts of the Jaromarsburg are still visible today.

== Steps to the beach: &quot;Königstreppe&quot; and &quot;Veilchentreppe&quot; ==

Several metres west of Cape Arkona is the &quot;Königstreppe&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Staircase&quot;), whose 230 steps climb up the 42-metre-high cliff 230.
The Swedish king, Frederick I – Rügen then belonged to Sweden – had a daymark erected near the present-day steps during the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743) in order to warn the population. Hence the spot was known as the &quot;Königssteig&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Climb&quot;.

In 1833, for the arrival of the steamboat &quot;Hercules&quot; during its Imperial Russian chronometer expedition, the Prussian king, Frederick William III - Rügen was now Prussian - had a landing stage and flight of steps built. From this point in 1865, the first telegraph cable was laid under the Baltic Sea to Sweden. With the rise of the island&#x27;s coastal resorts, tourism at Cape Arkona grew. Many travelers came by excursion boats that moored at the pier at the foot of the steps. The landing stage was, however, completely destroyed by the storm flood of 1953. The new &quot;Königstreppe&quot; steps were completed in 1995 at the same historic spot, taking a year to build.

South of the remnants of the ramparts at Jaromarsburg are the &quot;Veilchentreppe&quot; (&quot;Violet Staircase&quot;), a descent to the beach that runs from Arkona to Vitt. The name comes from the violets that grow around the staircase in spring.

== Bunkers ==
There are two bunkers in the immediate neighbourhood of the two lighthouses. The smaller, older bunker dates from &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; times and, in GDR days, housed an outpost of the 6th (Coastal) Border Brigade. It is generally called the &quot;Arkona Bunker&quot;.
The larger, newer bunker was built from 1979 to 1986 and acted as a command post for the Sixth Flotilla, stationed on Bug, and the Baltic Fleet (VOF). Starting from a main central tunnel with two entrances, there are several autonomous individual bunkers with a total area of 2,000 square metres. They comprise three large bunkers (type FB-75) and nine small ones (type FB-3), made of prefabricated concrete elements (FB = prefabricated bunker). The FB-75 type bunker had an intermediate floor level, where the sleeping areas were located, and an emergency exit. Each individual shelter has a main corridor and two airlocks. Over the top is a earth covering, from which protrude dozens of ventilation tubes.

In 1985, on the 30th anniversary of the National People&#x27;s Army (NVA), an aerial photograph of Cape Arkona, with the bunker complex in the background, was publicised in the picture book &quot;Soldaten des Volkes&quot; (&quot;Soldiers of the People&quot;). The bunkers were uncamouflaged. How the photograph was allowed to appear in this book is not clear, but it was withdrawn from circulation again just three days after its publication. A later edition of the illustrated book was published with the aerial image omitted. Today, the original picture book is a collector&#x27;s piece.

From 1986, 50–70 soldiers of the &quot;Volksmarine&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Navy&quot;) were on duty here for two to three days, three to four times a year, as part of naval exercises. The standard complement was four men. On 3 October 1990, the day of German reunification, the site was closed.

The bunkers were purchased and successively renovated by the municipality of Putgarten. The Arkona Bunker now houses an art gallery and the NVA Bunker an exhibition of GDR fittings and equipment as well as a series of photographs on the &quot;Volksmarine&quot;.

== Access ==

Just outside Putgarten is a large car park where all visitors to the cape have to park their cars or tour buses. From there the cape may be accessed on foot (1.8 km), by horse and carriage or on the Cape Arkona road train (&quot;Kap-Arkona-Bahn&quot;). The various sights may also be visited by bicycle.

Since 1993 the Cape Arkona Train has provided services from Putgarten to Cape Arkona and the fishing village of Vitt. It does not run on rails as the name suggests, but is a road train that runs on wheels on normal roads. The train is hauled by a tractor designed to look like a steam locomotive but since 1996 has actually been powered by a more environmentally-friendly gas engine.

Ships operated by the &quot;Reederei Ostsee-Tour&quot; also run daily from Binz and Sassnitz to Cape Arkona.

== Climate ==

The climate at Cape Arkona is typical of the North Vorpommern coast. The average annual temperature is . Precipitation amounts to per year. Because of its proximity to the sea, its humidity is very high. 

The Cape Arkona weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Highest Temperature on 30 June 2019.

* Shortest annual sunshine: 1,591.7 hours in 1987.

== Accident ==
On 26 December 2011, there was a major rock slide at Cape Arkona, which buried a ten-year-old girl and seriously injured her mother. A weeklong search for the child was given up on 8 January 2012 and it was not until 31 January 2012 that the child&#x27;s body was found at the foot of the cliff.

<doc id="142000" wikidata="Q1621467" url="?curid=142000" title="Symphonic black metal">
<text>Symphonic black metal is a subgenre of black metal that emerged in the 1990s and incorporates symphonic and orchestral elements. 

== History ==
One of the earliest forerunners in what would come to be the sound of Symphonic black metal was Celtic Frost on their 1987 album &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;. The first extreme metal bands incorporating classical, orchestral, and operatic elements into their music were Mekong Delta, Bulldozer on their album &quot;Neurodeliri&quot; (1988), Believer on &quot;Sanity Obscure&quot; (1990) and &quot;Dimensions&quot; (1993), Master&#x27;s Hammer on &quot;Ritual&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Jilemnice Occultist&quot; (1993) and Sigh on their debut &quot;Scorn Defeat&quot; (1993).

The style on Emperor&#x27;s &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse&quot; (1994) had a pioneering influence though and was the main inspiration for many keyboard-based black metal bands following after. Troll&#x27;s &quot;Drep de kristne&quot; (1995) and Arcturus&#x27; &quot;Aspera Hiems Symfonia&quot; (1996) are other notable early works of symphonic black metal, before the genre was commercialised by the international success of bands like Dimmu Borgir and Bal Sagoth.

== Characteristics ==
Symphonic black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates symphonic and orchestral elements. This may include the usage of keyboards to conjure up &quot;pseudo-orchestral&quot; soundscapes with default presets (e.g. strings, choirs, piano, organs, and pads), or full orchestral arrangements. Bands may feature solo instruments such as violins in addition to keyboards and/or orchestral arrangements. Vocals can be &quot;clean&quot; or operatic in style, and song structures are more defined or are inspired by symphonies, and follow a typical riff-based approach. Many of the characteristics of traditional black metal are retained, such as shrieks, fast tempos, high treble and tremolo-picked electric guitars. The overall sound and themes can be considered wider than traditional black metal, many groups of symphonic black metal use themes such as vampirism (Theatres des Vampires, Cradle of Filth), occultism and the paranormal (Carach Angren). Political themes are more neglected by them as in other black metal subgenres.

<text>Castle Douglas () is a town in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It lies in the lieutenancy area of Kirkcudbrightshire, in the eastern part of Galloway, between the towns of Dalbeattie and Gatehouse of Fleet. It is in the ecclesiastical parish of Kelton.

==History==

Castle Douglas is built next to Carlingwark Loch in which traces of prehistoric crannogs can be found, evidence of early inhabitation of the area. A large bronze cauldron containing about 100 metal objects was found in Carlingwark Loch near Fir Island about 1866. The hoard of tools of iron and bronze is probably Romano-Belgic of the late first or early second centuries AD and is likely to have been a votive offering. It is now in the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh. To the North of the town Glenlochar is the site of two successive Roman forts, the first being erected during the invasion of Agricola and the second during the Antonine period. They appear to have been for cavalry units and evidence has been found that a &quot;vicus&quot; grew up around them. They were abandoned completely by around 160 AD.

Nearby Threave Castle was a seat of the powerful &quot;Black&quot; Earls of Douglas. A small collection of cottages developed by the shores of Carlingwark, which was a source of marl. These cottages can still be seen on the Western approach to Castle Douglas and are known as &quot;The Buchan&quot;. The development of a military road through Galloway built by Major William Caulfeild passed through the Carlingwark area and improved transportation connections in the 18th century.

Traditionally Mary Queen of Scots is said to have lodged at the House of Fuffnock on the Crossmichael Road on her journey to Port Mary in 1568 after the Battle of Langside.

Castle Douglas was founded in 1792 by William Douglas, who claimed, but had no close connection with the ancient Douglases of Threave Castle. He had made his money in an &#x27;American Trade&#x27; and created a planned town on the shores of Carlingwark Loch. The town&#x27;s layout is based upon the grid plan pattern of streets as used in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, built around the same time. Sir William Douglas also created a number of industries in Castle Douglas, including hand-woven cotton factories from which Cotton Street derives its name.

The Torrs Pony-cap and Horns is an Iron Age bronze horned cap for a pony found in Torrs Loch at Castle Douglas in 1812. It was acquired by Joseph Train, FSA Scot., the local antiquarian and author who presented it to Sir Walter Scott for his collection of antiquities at Abbotsford House. It is now in the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh.

The completion of the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway in 1859 further improved the town&#x27;s connections, and it soon developed into a major market town for the surrounding area. This is still true today and the 1900 hexagonal market building is in constant use. Although the railway was closed in 1965, the A75 trunk road was developed roughly following the lines of the original military road and passes through Castle Douglas. The many hotels and pubs which derived from coach stops are an indication of the town&#x27;s importance as a stopping place for travellers.

Castle Douglas Town Hall was built in 1863 to the designs of Dumfries architect James Barbour.

The Clock Tower was built 1934-35 and stands at the corner of King St and St Andrews St and is a listed Category C building. It was designed by the architect William Forrest Valentine (1885–1957). The first tower, built by Sir William Douglas, was destroyed by fire in 1892 as was a second clock tower forty years later. A plaque records that in 1935 Henry J. Hewat of Paterson, New Jersey, USA, donated the present clock tower to the town. Capt Hewat was a native of Castle Douglas who had emigrated to the US in 1893.

Freeman Wills Croft set a key scene in his 1930 novel &quot;Sir John Magill&#x27;s Last Journey&quot; at Castle Douglas Railway Station.

St John the Evangelist Catholic Church was built in 1867 by the London architect George Goldie and is Category B(S) listed building.

The former Castle Douglas Parish Church (St Andrew&#x27;s) was remodelled by Robert Lorimer in 1900. It was converted into a theatre now known as The Fullarton.

The Castle Douglas War Memorial was designed by Captain Frank Mears and was unveiled in 1921.

Castle Douglas was a reception area for Glasgow&#x27;s evacuated children during World War II.

From March 1943 to April 1944, the town was the base for 92nd (Loyals) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, which was training for Operation Overlord, the invasion of occupied Europe. Their headquarters were at &quot;Craigroyston&quot;, a large Victorian house near the railway station. Nissen huts were set up at Carlingwark Loch to house the troops while other billets included a church and a bowling clubhouse.

==Sights and attractions==
Castle Douglas Art Gallery is an offshoot of the Stewartry Museum at Kirkcudbright. It was bequeathed to the town by local artist Ethel Bristowe and opened in 1938. It is an exhibition space and used as such by local artists to display their work. It was designed by the Kirkcudbrightshire County Council architect William MacKinnell.

Near the centre of town is Carlingwark Loch, a loch and SSSI, home to numerous water birds.

Nearby stands Threave Castle, the family castle of the Black Douglas line of the House of Douglas. It lies on an island in the middle of the River Dee, admission includes the short ferry journey.

Also to the west of the town are Threave Gardens, a National Trust for Scotland property.

Threave Rovers are the local football team in Castle Douglas, they play at Meadow Park in the West of Scotland Football League and their strip colours are black and white stripes.

Castle Douglas used to host an annual Civic Week which was the focal event of the year. Its usual format is a week of events around the last week in July, culminating on Douglas Day when a street procession and carnival in Lochside Park takes place, now parades have been cancelled.

==Amenities==
The town is commonly used by tourists as a base for exploring the rest of the area. There is a camping and caravan park by Carlingwark Loch and many hotels.

The main shopping street in Castle Douglas is King Street. It has a wide range of shops, including many shops not often found on many town high streets. Castle Douglas has two supermarkets and a convenience store. Also on King Street are Italian, Chinese and Indian restaurants as well as pubs and hotels serving meals and several take-aways. Castle Douglas is designated Scotland&#x27;s Food Town and boasts some 50 outlets connected with the food industry.

Parking in the town is free. There is a large car park at Market Hill at the top of the town next to the Heart of Galloway Visitor Centre. There is also free parking on many of the side streets that lead away from the town centre.

As a Regional Market Town, Castle Douglas accommodates Wallets Mart, a livestock market visited by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2010.

There are several churches in Castle Douglas, including a Church of Scotland, a Betheren, an Episcopalian St Ninian&#x27;s, the New Life Church Castle Douglas and an Elim Pentecostal Church. The Catholic Parish of St John the Evangelist offers Mass in St Ninian Episcopalian Church.

Castle Douglas Hospital was built in 1897 as a memorial to Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. It was designed by Richard Park of Newton Stewart and opened on 13 October 1899.

The town has a vibrant Community Centre on Cotton Street with over 600 users and is home to The Fullarton, a theatre opened 1996 in the building of the former St Andrew&#x27;s Church. It currently hosts plays and conferences as well as providing a local cinema.

2329 (Castle Douglas) Sqn Air Training Corps is located in the town and are active within the local community, as well as offering young people between the ages of 12 and 20 opportunities to fly, visit RAF stations across the UK and experience adventures.

There is a library, swimming pool and bus hub in Market Street.

Castle Douglas Library situated on the Market Hill, was designed by architect George Washington Browne and opened in 1904 with funding from Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish - American industrialist and philanthropist. As well as books and a local history section it offers a range of services including internet access.

The swimming pool has a fitness suite attached. The bus hub provides services throughout Dumfries and Galloway, and onward through Scotland and England.

==Robert Burns==
Robert Burns spent the night here at the Carlinwark Inn while on his Galloway Tour. From here he wrote a letter to Mrs Dunlop in Ayrshire dated 25 June 1794 beginning&quot; &quot;Here, in a solitary inn, in a solitary village...&quot; &quot;. Here also he wrote his last letter to Agnes McLehose with the lines,&quot;Ah ! My ever dearest Clarinda ! ...Here am I set, a solitary hermit, in the solitary room, of a solitary inn, with a solitary bottle of wine by me.&quot;

The first stage from Glasgow of the 2019 Tour of Britain which ended in Kirkcudbright on 7 September passed through Castle Douglas. The winner of this stage was Dutchman Dylan Groenewegen (Team Jumbo–Visma).

==Climate==
As with the remainder of the UK, Castle Douglas has a climate classified as Oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), resulting in moderate temperatures, year round rainfall, and windy, often cloudy conditions. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Threave, about west of the town centre.

<doc id="142005" wikidata="Q13632630" url="?curid=142005" title="Thyroid neoplasm">
<text>Thyroid neoplasm is a neoplasm or tumor of the thyroid. It can be a benign tumor such as thyroid adenoma, or it can be a malignant neoplasm (thyroid cancer), such as papillary, follicular, medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer. Most patients are 25 to 65 years of age when first diagnosed; women are more affected than men. The estimated number of new cases of thyroid cancer in the United States in 2023 is 43,720 compared to only 2,120 deaths. Of all thyroid nodules discovered, only about 5 percent are cancerous, and under 3 percent of those result in fatalities.

==Diagnosis==

The first step in diagnosing a thyroid neoplasm is a physical exam of the neck area. If any abnormalities exist, a doctor needs to be consulted. A family doctor may conduct blood tests, an ultrasound, and nuclear scan as steps to a diagnosis. The results from these tests are then read by an endocrinologist who will determine what problems the thyroid has.
Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are two conditions that often arise from an abnormally functioning thyroid gland. These occur when the thyroid is producing too much or too little thyroid hormone respectively.

Thyroid nodules are a major presentation of thyroid neoplasms, and are diagnosed by ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (USG/FNA) or frequently by thyroidectomy (surgical removal and subsequent histological examination). FNA is the most cost-effective and accurate method of obtaining a biopsy sample. As thyroid cancer can take up iodine, radioactive iodine is commonly used to treat thyroid carcinomas, followed by TSH suppression by high-dose thyroxine therapy.

Nodules are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20. The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely, and thus the potential for malignancy is far greater.

===Classification===
Thyroid neoplasm might be classified as benign or malignant.

====Benign neoplasms====
Thyroid adenoma is a benign neoplasm of the thyroid. Thyroid nodules are very common and around 80 percent of adults will have at least one by the time they reach 70 years of age. Approximately 90 to 95 percent of all nodules are found to be benign.

====Malignant neoplasms====

Thyroid cancers are mainly papillary, follicular, medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer. Most patients are 25 to 65 years of age when first diagnosed; women are more affected than men. Nearly 80 percent of thyroid cancer is papillary and about 15 percent is follicular; both types grow slowly and can be cured if caught early. Medullary thyroid cancer makes up about 3 percent of this cancer. It grows slowly and can be controlled if caught early. Anaplastic is the most deadly and makes up around 2 percent. This type grows quickly and is hard to control. The classification is determined by looking at the sample of cells under a microscope and determining the type of thyroid cell that is present.
Other thyroid malignancies include thyroid lymphoma, various types of thyroid sarcoma, smooth muscle tumors, teratoma, squamous cell thyroid carcinoma and other rare types of tumors.
==Treatment==
Treatment of a thyroid nodule depends on many things including size of the nodule, age of the patient, the type of thyroid cancer, and whether or not it has spread to other tissues in the body. If the nodule is benign, patients may receive thyroxine therapy to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone and should be reevaluated in six months. However, if the benign nodule is inhibiting the patient&#x27;s normal functions of life; such as breathing, speaking, or swallowing, the thyroid may need to be removed. Sometimes only part of the thyroid is removed in an attempt to avoid causing hypothyroidism. There is still a risk of hypothyroidism though, as the remaining thyroid tissue may not be able to produce enough hormones in the long-run.

If the nodule is malignant or has indeterminate cytologic features, it may require surgery. A thyroidectomy is a medium-risk surgery that can result in complications if not performed correctly. Problems with the voice, nerve or muscular damage, or bleeding from a lacerated blood vessel are rare but serious complications that may occur. After removing the thyroid, the patient must be supplied with a replacement hormone for the rest of their life. This is commonly a daily oral medication prescribed by their endocrinologist. 

Radioactive iodine-131 is used in patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Patients with medullary, anaplastic, and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy. External irradiation may be used when the cancer is unresectable, when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from bone metastasis.

<text>The Moscow theater hostage crisis (also known as the 2002 Nord-Ost siege) was the seizure of the crowded Dubrovka Theater in Moscow by Chechen terrorists on 23 October 2002, resulting in the taking of 912 hostages. The attackers, led by Movsar Barayev, claimed allegiance to the Islamist separatist movement in Chechnya. They demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya and an end to the Second Chechen War. The crisis was resolved when Russian security services released sleeping gas into the building, and subsequently stormed it, killing all 40 hostage takers. 132 hostages died, largely due to the effects of the gas.

Due to the layout of the theater, special forces would have had to fight through of corridor and advance up a well-defended staircase before they could reach the hall in which the hostages were held. The attackers had numerous explosives, with the most powerful in the center of the auditorium. Spetsnaz operators from Federal Security Service (FSB) Alpha and Vympel, supported by a Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) SOBR unit, pumped a chemical agent into the building&#x27;s ventilation system and began the rescue operation.

The identity of the gas was not disclosed at the time, although it was believed to have been a fentanyl derivative. A study published in 2012 concluded that it had been a mixture of carfentanil and remifentanil. The same study pointed out that in a 2011 case at the European Court of Human Rights, the Russian government stated that the aerosol used was a mixture of a fentanyl derivative and a chemical compound with a narcotic action.

==Initial siege==
The hostages were seized on 23 October at the House of Culture of State Ball-Bearing Plant Number 1 in the Dubrovka area of Moscow about four kilometers south-east of the Moscow Kremlin. During Act II of a sold-out performance of &quot;Nord-Ost&quot; a little after 9:00 PM, 40–50 heavily armed masked men and women drove in a bus to the theater and entered the main hall firing assault rifles in the air.

The black-and-camouflage-clad attackers took approximately 850–900 people hostage, including members of the audience and performers, among them an MVD general. The reaction of spectators inside the theater to the news that the theater was under terrorist attack was not uniform: some people remained calm, some reacted hysterically, and others fainted. Some performers who had been resting backstage escaped through an open window and called the police; in all, some 90 people managed to flee the building or hide.

The terrorist leader told the hostages that the attackers (who identified themselves as a suicide squad from &quot;the 29th Division&quot;) had no grudge against foreign nationals (about 75 in number from 14 countries, including Australia, Georgia, Germany, the Netherlands, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States) and promised to release anyone who showed a foreign passport.

===Demands===
The gunmen were led by Movsar Barayev, nephew of slain Chechen rebel militia commander Arbi Barayev, and threatened to kill the hostages unless Russian forces were immediately and unconditionally withdrawn from Chechnya. They said the deadline was one week, after which they would start killing the hostages.

A videotaped statement was acquired by the media in which the gunmen declared their willingness to die for their cause. The statement contained the following text:

According to the Kremlin&#x27;s aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky, &quot;When they were told that the withdrawal of troops was unrealistic within the short period, that it was a very long process, the terrorists put forward the demand to withdraw Russian troops from anywhere in the Republic of Chechnya without specifying which area it was.&quot; The hostage-takers demanded termination of the use of artillery and air forces in Chechnya starting the next day (Russian forces ceased using heavy weapons until 28 September), a halt to the notorious &quot;zachistka&quot; (&quot;mopping-up&quot;) operations, and that President of Russia Vladimir Putin should publicly declare that he was striving to stop the war in Chechnya. By the time of the hostage-taking, the conflict in the embattled republic was killing an average of three federal troops daily.

Cell phone conversations between the hostages trapped in the building and their family members revealed that the hostage-takers had grenades, mines and improvised explosive devices strapped to their bodies, and had deployed more explosives throughout the theater. The militants used Arabic names among themselves, and the female terrorists wore Arab-style &quot;niqab&quot; clothes which are highly unusual in the North Caucasus region.

Mufti Akhmad-Khadzhi Shamayev, official leader of Chechnya&#x27;s Muslims, said he had no information about who the attackers were and condemned attacks on civilians. The pro-Moscow Islamic leader of Chechnya also condemned the attack.

All hostages were kept in the auditorium and the orchestra pit was used as a lavatory. The situation in the hall was nervous and it frequently changed depending on the mood of the hostage-takers, who were following reports in the mass media. Any kind of misinformation caused hopelessness among the hostages and new aggression among their captors, who would threaten to shoot hostages and blow up the building, but no major incidents took place during the siege. The gunmen let members of the audience make phone calls. One hostage used her mobile phone to plead with authorities not to storm the auditorium, as truckloads of police and soldiers with armored vehicles surrounded the building.

==Hostage-taking==
===Day one23 October===
The attackers released 150 to 200 people, including children, pregnant women, Muslims, some foreign-born theater-goers and people requiring medical treatment in the early hours after they invaded. Two women managed to escape (one of them was injured while escaping). The terrorists said they were ready to kill ten hostages for any of their number killed if the security forces intervened.

====Olga Romanova====
At 1:30 AM, Olga Romanova, a 26-year-old civilian acting on her own, entered the theater, crossing the police cordon by herself. She entered the theater and began urging the hostages to stand up to their captors. There was considerable confusion in the auditorium. The terrorists believed she was a Federal Security Service (FSB) agent and she was shot and killed seconds later. Romanova&#x27;s body was later removed from the building by a Russian medical team, incorrectly reported by the Moscow police as the body of the first hostage who was killed while trying to escape. Romanova was described as &quot;strong-willed&quot;, and lived near the theater. It is unknown how she crossed the police lines undetected.

===Day two24 October===
The Russian government offered the hostage-takers the opportunity to leave for any country other than Russia or Chechnya if they released all hostages unharmed. The hostages made an appeal, possibly under orders or duress, for Putin to cease hostilities in Chechnya and asked him to refrain from assaulting the building. Because of the crisis, Putin canceled an overseas trip that would have included meetings with then-U.S. President George W. Bush and other world leaders.

The hostage-takers demanded to talk with Joseph Kobzon, a member of parliament and singer, and with International Red Cross representatives. Kobzon (accompanied by three people, including a man waving some white fabric like a flag), entered the building about 1:20 PM. Shortly thereafter, a man in his sixties, appearing feeble and distraught, left the theater. The Interfax news agency identified him as a British citizen, but did not provide details. A woman and three children, believed to be Russians, were let out a few minutes later.

Other well-known public and political figures such as Aslambek Aslakhanov, Irina Khakamada, Ruslan Khasbulatov, Boris Nemtsov and Grigory Yavlinsky took part in negotiations with the hostage-takers. Ex-President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev also announced his willingness to act as an intermediary in the course of negotiations. Militants also demanded that representatives of the International Red Cross and &quot;Médecins Sans Frontières&quot; (Doctors Without Borders) come to the theater to lead negotiations. FSB Colonel Konstantin Vasilyev attempted to enter the patio of the theater, but was shot at while approaching the building and forced to retreat.

According to the FSB, thirty nine hostages were set free by the terrorists on 24 October 2002, but they repeated via one of the hostages an earlier threat to start shooting their captives if Russia failed to take their demands seriously. Negotiations on the release of non-Russian nationals were conducted by various embassies and the Chechens promised to release all foreign hostages. The kidnappers claimed they were ready to release 50 Russian hostages if Akhmad Kadyrov, head of Chechnya&#x27;s pro-Moscow administration, would come to the theater, but Kadyrov did not respond, and the release did not take place.

A hot water pipe burst overnight and was flooding the ground floor. The hostage-takers called the flooding a &quot;provocation&quot; and an FSB spokesman said no agreement had been reached on having the pipe repaired. It later turned out that the sewer system was used by the Russian special forces for listening purposes.

===Day three25 October===
During the third day, the following people took part in negotiations with the militants: journalists Anna Politkovskaya, Sergei Govorukhin and Mark Franchetti as well as public figures Yevgeny Primakov, Ruslan Aushev and again, Aslambek Aslakhanov. The terrorists demanded negotiations with an official representative of Vladimir Putin. Relatives of the hostages staged anti-war demonstrations outside the theater and in central Moscow.

The hostage-takers agreed to release seventy-five foreign citizens in the presence of diplomatic representatives of their states. 15 Russian citizens were released, including eight children (aged 7 to 13). After a meeting with Putin, the FSB head Nikolai Patrushev offered to spare the lives of the Chechens if they released the remaining hostages unharmed.

A group of Russian doctors including Dr. Leonid Roshal, head of the Medical Center for Catastrophes, entered the theater to bring medicine for the hostages and said the terrorists were not beating or threatening their captives. He said most of the hostages were calm and that only &quot;two or three&quot; of the hostages were hysterical. Some hot food, warm clothes, and medicine had also been taken in by the Red Cross.

NTV channel journalists recorded an interview with Movsar Barayev, in which he sent a message to the Russian government:

We have nothing to lose. We have already covered 2,000 kilometers by coming here. There is no way back... We have come to die. Our motto is freedom and paradise. We already have freedom as we&#x27;ve come to Moscow. Now we want to be in paradise.

He also said the group had come to Moscow not to kill the hostages or to fight with Russia&#x27;s elite troops, as they had had enough fighting in Chechnya over the years: &quot;We came here with a specific aimto put an end to the war and that is it.&quot;

At 9:55 PM, four hostages (citizens of Azerbaijan) were released, bringing the total number of hostages that were set free on this day to 19.

====Gennady Vlakh====
After dusk, a man identified as Gennady Vlakh ran across the square and gained entry to the theater. He said that his son was among the hostages, but his son did not seem to be present and the man was led away and shot by the Chechens.
There is considerable confusion surrounding this incident, and Vlakh&#x27;s body was cremated before it was identified.

====Denis Gribkov====
Around midnight, a gunfire incident took place as Denis Gribkov, a 30-year-old male hostage, ran over the backs of theater seats toward the female insurgents who were sitting next to a large improvised explosive device. A male Chechen shot at him and missed, but stray bullets hit and severely wounded Tamara Starkova and fatally wounded Pavel Zakharov, who were evacuated from the building soon after. Gribkov was removed from the auditorium and later found dead from gunshot wounds.

===Day fourMorning of 26 October===
During the night, Akhmed Zakayev, a Chechen envoy and associate of the separatist President Aslan Maskhadov, appealed to the extremists and asked them to &quot;refrain from rash steps&quot;. The Chechens told the BBC that a special representative of President Putin planned to come to the theater for talks the next day. Two members of the Spetsnaz Alpha Group moving around in the no-man&#x27;s land were seriously wounded by a grenade fired from the building by the terrorists, which was blamed by the Moscow police chief Vladimir Pronin on the media news leak.

According to an officer in the Russian special forces cited by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the leak was controlled: &quot;We leaked the information that the storming would take place at three in the morning. The Chechen fighters were on their guard. They began shooting, but there was no raid. Then there was the natural reactiona relaxation. And at 5 a.m. we stormed the place.&quot;

====Special forces raid====
Early Saturday morning, 26 October, forces from Russia&#x27;s Spetsnaz (Special Forces, literally &quot;special purpose&quot;) from the FSB (Alpha Group and Vympel), with the assistance of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) SOBR unit, surrounded and stormed the theater; all were heavily armed and masked. Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Vasilyev stated that the raid was prompted by a panic among the captives due to the execution of two female hostages. The raid was planned shortly after the hostages were initially seized and the shooting cited as a proximate cause had occurred about three hours before the operation began.

====Chemical attack====

Early in the morning before dawn, at around 5:00a.m. Moscow time, the searchlights that had been illuminating the main entrance to the theater went out.

Inside, although many hostages at first took the gas (aerosol) to be smoke from a fire, it soon became apparent to gunmen and hostages alike that a mysterious gas had been pumped into the building. Different reports said it came either through the specially created hole in the wall, that it was pumped through the theater&#x27;s ventilation system, or that it emerged from beneath the stage. The security services pumped an aerosol anaesthetic, later stated by Russian Health Minister Yuri Shevchenko to be based on fentanyl, into the theater through the air conditioning system. The discovery caused panic in the auditorium. Hostage Anna Andrianova, a correspondent for &quot;Moskovskaya Pravda&quot;, called Echo of Moscow radio studio and conducted a live broadcast with hostages who started feeling the effects of the gas used by the government forces and begged them to desist.

====Assault====
The Chechens, some of whom were equipped with gas masks, responded by firing blindly at the Russian positions outside. After thirty minutes, when the gas had taken effect, a physical assault on the building commenced. The combined forces entered through numerous building openings, including the roof, the basement, and finally the front door.

When the shooting began, the terrorists told their hostages to lean forward in the theater seats and cover their heads behind the seats. Hostages reported that some people in the audience fell asleep, and some of the gunmen put on respirators. As the terrorists and hostages began to fall unconscious, several of the female terrorists made a dash for the balcony but passed out before they reached the stairs. They were later found shot dead. Two of the Spetsnaz Alpha Group were also overcome by the gas.

After nearly one and a half hours of sporadic gun battles, the Russian special forces blew open the doors to the main hall and poured into the auditorium. In a fierce firefight, the federals killed most of the hostage-takers, both those still awake and those who had succumbed to the gas.

According to the Russian government, fighting between the troops and the still-conscious Chechen fighters continued in other parts of the building for another 30 minutes to one hour. Initial reports stated that three terrorists were captured alive (the BBC reported that a &quot;handful of surviving fighters were led away in handcuffs&quot;) and two of them managed to escape. Later, the government claimed that all hostage-takers had been killed in the storming.

Alpha team troops said that &quot;this is our first successful operation [in] years&quot;. &quot;Moskovskij Komsomolets&quot; cited a Russian special forces operative saying that &quot;if it were a usual storming, we&#x27;d have had 150 casualties among our men, added to the hostages.&quot;

==Evacuation==

At 7:00 a.m., rescuers began carrying the bodies of hostages out of the building. Bodies were laid in rows in the foyer and on the pavement at the main entrance to the TC, unprotected from falling rain and snow. None of the bodies witnessed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; correspondent Nick Paton Walsh had bullet wounds or showed signs of bleeding, but &quot;their faces were waxy, white and drawn, their eyes open and blank.&quot; Shortly, the entire space was filled with bodies of the dead and those unconscious from the gas but still alive.

Ambulances were standing by and ordinary city buses were brought in. Medical workers were expecting to treat victims of explosions and gunfire but not a secret chemical agent. If the drug used was indeed a fentanyl derivative or other μ⁠-⁠opioid receptor agonist, an opioid receptor antagonist drug like naloxone would have counteracted the chemical agent&#x27;s effects, but would have had to be administered by rescue workers immediately upon arriving. Some reports said the drug was used to save some hostages.

The bodies of dead hostages were put in two buses which were parked at the TC. Initial reports said nothing about casualties among the hostages. The crisis HQ representatives went to the college hall, where relatives of the hostages had been waiting, and told them that allegedly there were no fatalities among the hostages. The first official report of fatalities among the hostages came at about 9:00 a.m. Despite the death of five children which had been already reported by medical personnel, the official statement claimed there were no children among the dead.

At 1:00 p.m., Vasilyev announced at a press conference a &quot;definitive&quot; death toll of 67 hostages, who he said were killed by Chechens, but again said no children nor foreigners were among those killed. Armed guards were posted at the hospitals where victims were taken and doctors were ordered not to release any of the theater patients in case militants had concealed themselves among the hostages.

The hostages&#x27; family members panicked as the government refused to release any information about which hospitals their loved ones had been taken to, or even whether their relatives were among the dead. The official number of the dead rose to 90, including 25 children, while it was still claimed that the final attack was provoked by the terrorists executing their captives. Later the same day, the official death toll among hostages had risen to at least 118 and the officials had not specified exactly what killed them. By 28 October, of the 646 former hostages who remained hospitalized, 150 were still in intensive care and 45 were in critical condition.

Seventy-three hostages (including six minors) were rendered no medical aid. There were several Chechens among the hostages and it may be that some of them were not treated because of their Chechen names. Money and other valuables belonging to the victims vanished; official reports stated that the valuables were stolen by an FSB officer who was later killed in a car crash. The Russian authorities initially maintained that none of the deaths among the hostages occurred through poisoning. They spoke of health problems that were exacerbated by the three-day ordeal with very little food or water, or indeed, medical attention.

==Casualties==
The number of estimated casualties varies widely because many hostages remained unaccounted for and were not included in the official list (see below). Some estimates have put the civilian death toll at more than 200 with 204 names on one list, or even 300, including people who died during the year after the siege from complications from the poison gas. Some former hostages and relatives of the victims claim that the death toll from the chemical agent is being kept secret. According to official numbers, 40 terrorists and about 130 hostages died during the raid or in the following days.
Andrei Seltsovsky, Moscow&#x27;s health committee chairman, announced that all but one of the hostages killed in the raid had died from the effects of the unknown gas rather than from gunshot wounds. The cause of death listed for all hostages was declared to be &quot;terrorism,&quot; claiming they died from heart attacks or other physical ailments. Among the fatalities, 17 were &quot;Nord-Ost&quot; cast members, including two child actors. Of the foreign nationals, three were from Ukraine, and the others were citizens of Austria, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands and the United States. About 700 surviving hostages were poisoned by the gas, and some of them received injuries leading to second- and third-degree disabilities (indicating medium- and light-severity debilitation in the Russian disability classification system). Several Russian special forces operatives were also poisoned by the gas during the operation. According to court testimony from A. Vorobiev, Director of the Russian Academic Bacteriology Center, most, if not all, of the deaths were caused by suffocation when hostages collapsed on chairs with heads falling back or were transported and left lying on their backs by rescue workers; in such a position, tongue prolapse causes blockage of breathing.

==Responsibility==
The operation was conducted primarily by the Chechen radical militant group The Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR), with involvement from the RSRSBCM and International Islamic Brigade. The operation was led by Movsar Barayev.

Military commander Shamil Basayev posted a statement on his website claiming ultimate responsibility for the incident, resigning all official positions within the Chechen government and promising new attacks. He also apologized to Chechnya&#x27;s elected president and separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov for not informing him of the planned raid and asked him for forgiveness. Basayev defended the hostage-taking for giving &quot;all Russians a first-hand insight into all the charms of the war unleashed by Russia and take it back to where it originated from&quot; and said that his &quot;main goal will be destroying the enemy and exacting maximum damage&quot; and &quot;the next time, those who come won&#x27;t make any demands, won&#x27;t take hostages.&quot;

The Russian government claimed that wiretapped phone conversations prove that Maskhadov knew of the plans in advance, which he denied. Aslan Maskhadov and his representatives in the West condemned the attack which they said had nothing to do with official policy. Maskhadov said he felt responsible for those &quot;who resorted to self-sacrifice in despair&quot;, but also said the &quot;barbaric and inhumane policies&quot; of the Russian leadership were ultimately to blame and criticized the storming of the theater. He offered to start unconditional peace talks with the Russian government to find a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya.

The siege was seen as a public relations disaster for Maskhadov, and his more radical Islamic field commanders correspondingly benefited. Some commentators suggested that Movladi Udugov was in charge from behind the scenes. Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer suggested that the aim of the extremist leaders seemed to have been to provoke the Russian government forces &quot;to kill ethnic Russians in Moscow on a large scale&quot;, which happened. According to the report by Russian investigators, Zura Barayeva, the widow of Arbi Barayev, led the female members of the group, while a man known as Yasir, identified by his documents as Idris Alkhazurov, was said to be the group&#x27;s &quot;ideologist&quot; believed to be trained in Saudi Arabia. Russian officials said Chechen militants received financing from groups based in Turkey and that they intercepted telephone calls from the captors to unidentified embassies in Moscow, as well as to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

==Aftermath==
After the raid, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said that &quot;the operation was carried out brilliantly by special forces;&quot; he claimed he had wanted a negotiated end to the crisis, but the final attack was made necessary by the reported killing of hostages. The Russian presidential special envoy for human rights in Chechnya, Abdul-Khakim Sultygov, said the bloody outcome was &quot;a good lesson to the terrorists and their accomplices.&quot;

Deputy Interior Minister Vasilyev launched a Moscow-wide operation to catch anyone who might have helped the militants, while his superior, Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov, urged people to be vigilant and to report anyone acting suspiciously to police. On 29 October, Vasilyev said he had the authority to state only that special chemical agents had been used and that some 30 suspected militants and their collaborators, including several civil servants and security officers, had been arrested around the theater and in other parts of the city in what Gryzlov called an &quot;unprecedented operation&quot; to identify what he described as a vast terrorist network in Moscow and the surrounding region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the scale and violence of the assault in a televised address later on the morning of 26 October, stating that the government had &quot;achieved the near impossible, saving hundreds... of people&quot; and that the rescue &quot;proved it is impossible to bring Russia to its knees&quot;. Putin thanked the special forces as well as the Russian citizens for their &quot;bravery&quot; and the international community for the support given against the &quot;common enemy&quot;. He also asked forgiveness for not being able to save more of the hostages, and declared Monday a national day of mourning for those who died. He vowed to continue fighting &quot;international terrorism&quot;.

On 29 October, Putin released another televised statement, saying: &quot;Russia will respond with measures that are adequate to the threat to the Russian Federation, striking all the places where the terrorists themselves, the organizers of these crimes and their ideological and financial inspirations are. I stress, wherever they may be located.&quot; It was commonly assumed Putin was threatening the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. Putin&#x27;s comments came as British Prime Minister Tony Blair phoned him to congratulate him on the ending of the siege.

President Putin was unhappy with the coverage of the hostage crisis by NTV, the last nationwide TV channel effectively independent of the government. In January 2003 the management of NTV was replaced, resulting in a profound effect on its editorial policy.

===Long-term consequences===
The attacks prompted Putin&#x27;s government to take harsher measures against Chechen separatists. On 28 October, two days after the crisis, he announced that unspecified &quot;measures adequate to the threat&quot; would henceforth be taken in response to terrorist activity, with reports of 30 fighters killed near the Chechen capital Grozny. The Russian Ministry of Defense cancelled plans to reduce the 80,000 troop presence in the tiny breakaway Chechen republic.

In early November, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov announced Russian forces had launched large-scale operations against separatists throughout Chechnya. The actions of the military caused a new wave of refugees, according to the pro-Moscow Chechen official and the hostage crisis negotiator Aslanbek Aslakhanov.

On 29 May 2008, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) unanimously condemned Russia for enforced disappearances in five cases from Chechnya, including the disappearance of two young women in Ulus-Kert (the prosecutor&#x27;s office initially stated to media that Aminat Dugayeva and Kurbika Zinabdiyeva had been arrested on suspicion of involvement with the Moscow siege).

President Maskhadov&#x27;s unconditional offer for peace talks with Russia was swiftly dismissed, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov compared such calls with the suggestion that Europe should conduct such talks with the former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Russia also accused former Chechen Republic leader Akhmed Zakayev of involvement in the attack. When he visited Denmark for a peace congress in October 2002 (the World Chechen Congress event in Copenhagen), the Russians demanded his arrest and extradition; Zakayev was held for over a month, but was released after Danish authorities stated they were not convinced that sufficient evidence had been provided. The Kremlin also accused the Danish authorities of &quot;solidarity with terrorists&quot; by allowing the meeting of about 100 Chechens, Russian human rights activists and lawmakers from Russia and other European countries to gather and discuss ways to end the fighting.

In early November, the Russian Duma approved a broad array of anti-terrorism legislation ranging from far-reaching restrictions on media coverage of terrorism-related incidents to secret burials for killed terrorists (one lawmaker went as far as to suggest wrapping terrorists&#x27; corpses in pigskin and another suggested &quot;carting them around the city with their legs dangling&quot;). The new media law severely restricted the media&#x27;s reporting of anti-terrorist operations, banning publication or broadcast of &quot;any statement that hinders an operation to break such a siege, or attempts to justify the aims of the hostage-takers&quot;. These new policies prompted renewed fears in Russia that Putin was systematically taking control of all Russian media. Sergei Yushenkov, whose Liberal Russia party voted against the change, was quoted by Reuters as saying: &quot;On a wave of emotion, we have in fact legitimised censorship and practically banned criticism of the authorities in emergency situations.&quot; Coverage of Chechnya had already been severely restricted, needing the cooperation of both the Russian military and the Moscow-backed Chechen administration (see Russian government censorship of Chechnya coverage). A law by which corpses of people convicted or accused of terrorism would not be released to their families, but disposed of in secret was approved, applying to the bodies of the militants killed in the Moscow crisis, and later applying even to President Maskhadov, who was killed in 2005.

In 2003, Human Rights Watch reported Chechens in Moscow were subjected to increased police harassment after the hostage crisis. Moscow&#x27;s Chechens rose in numbers from about 20,000 in the Soviet period to an estimated 80,000 in 2002.

Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the death of so many hostages in the special forces&#x27; rescue operation would severely damage President Putin&#x27;s popularity. This prediction reportedly turned out to be wrong. Shortly after the siege, the Russian president had record public approval ratings; in December 2002, 83% of Russians reportedly declared themselves satisfied with Putin&#x27;s rule and his handling of the siege.

==Investigation==
The official investigation that the Moscow City Prosecutor&#x27;s Office had been carrying out for three and a half years failed to provide positive information on the gas agent that killed hostages, possible antidote to that agent, the number of hostages released by the operation, the number of militants who had seized the theater (hostages claimed that they saw more than 50 militants, whereas only 40 hostage takers were in the building according to the official version), and the names of officials who had made the decision about the assault. On 1 June 2007, news came that the official investigation had been suspended. The reason provided was that the &quot;culprit had not been located&quot;.

The same month, Tatiana Karpova, co-chair of the Nord-Ost Organization of former hostages and families of the dead, demanded a new criminal investigation. She claimed the authorities failed to meet their obligations related to right to life. She stated her concern about the lack of medical care for the injured, and future medical problems for the survivors. In July 2007, relatives of those who died in the hostage-taking urged the Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia to investigate whether senior officials were responsible for the deaths.

===Claims of FSB involvement===
The Duma refused to consider a proposal by the liberal democratic Union of Rightist Forces party to form an investigative commission charged with probing the government&#x27;s actions in the theater siege.

An independent investigation of the event was undertaken by Russian politicians Sergei Yushenkov, Sergei Kovalev, journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Hoover Institute scholar John B. Dunlop, and former FSB officers Aleksander Litvinenko and Mikhail Trepashkin. According to their version, the FSB knew about the terrorist group&#x27;s arrival in Moscow and directed them to the theater through their agent provocateur Khanpasha Terkibayev (&quot;Abu Bakar&quot;), whose name was in the list of hostage takers and who left the theater alive. In April 2003 Litvinenko gave information about Terkibayev (&quot;the Terkibayev file&quot;) to Sergei Yushenkov when he visited London. Yushenkov passed this file to Politkovskaya and she was able to interview Terkibayev in person. A few days later, Yushenkov was assassinated by gunfire in Moscow. Terkibayev was later killed in an apparent car crash in Chechnya.

In June 2003, Litvinenko stated in an interview with the Australian television programme &quot;Dateline&quot;, that two of the Chechen militants involved in the siege—whom he named &quot;Abdul the Bloody&quot; and &quot;Abu Bakar&quot;—were working for the FSB, and that the agency manipulated the terrorists into staging the attack. Litvinenko said: &quot;[w]hen they tried to find [Abdul the Bloody and Abu Bakar] among the rotting corpses of dead terrorists, they weren&#x27;t there. The FSB got its agents out. So the FSB agents among Chechens organized the whole thing on FSB orders, and those agents were released&quot;. &quot;Abu Bakar&quot; (presumably Terkibayev) was also described as an FSB agent and organizer of the theater siege by Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Khinshtein and other journalists. Sanobar Shermatova and a co-author had pointed out in &quot;Moskovskie novosti&quot; that Terkibaev had for a number of years been involved in &quot;anti-Wahhabi&quot; activities.

John Dunlop identifies &quot;Abu Bakar&quot; as Ruslan Elmurzaev, claimed by Mikhail Trepaskin to have been a resident of Moscow, not Chechnya, and to have been involved in various criminal activities operating out of the Hotel Salyut in Moscow. There were reports that Elmurzaev had not been killed in the storming of the theater. Film director Sergei Govorukhin, one of the volunteer negotiators at Dubrovka, has said that he is convinced that Elmurzaev, who he identified as an FSB agent, is still alive. Russian prosecutors were unable to show Elmurzaev&#x27;s corpse and during a visit to Chechnya in October 2003, Russian intelligence officers confirmed to him that Elmurzaev was alive and well and living in Chechnya.

The titular leader of the hostage takers was one Movsar Baraev, the nephew of the late and infamous &quot;Wahhabi kidnapper&quot; Arbi Baraev, a figure reported to have shadowy connections to both the FSB and GRU. In January 2003, the French journalist Anne Nivat reported that Baraev had been arrested two months before the hostage-taking incident. This information being true, Baraev was already in Russian custody when the theater siege occurred. Nivat also reported that two of the female hostage takers were also in Russian custody at the time of the siege while late Duma Deputy Yurii Shchekochikhin wrote that another female hostage taker was in custody at the time.

That &quot;Abu Bakar&quot; was in control and not Baraev was supported by an article in &quot;Moskovskie novosti&quot; by journalists Shermatova and Teit, in which it was reported that a hushed conversation between Abu Bakar and Baraev had been accidentally captured by NTV. Baraev declared that the hostage takers had been sent by Shamil Basaev only to be quietly corrected by Abu Bakar to add &#x27;Aslan Maskhadov&#x27;, in order to link the latter to the hostage taking. As an evidence against Maskhadov, Russians cited a tape first shown on Al Jazeera and subsequently on Russian television, although only a fragment of the original tape was shown on Russian TV. On the original full length tape it was evident that it had been made in late summer, not in October, and had concerned a military operation against federal forces, not an act of hostage taking. Nevertheless, Maskhadov had been discredited although there is no credible evidence to link him with the siege. In the end, it could be said that both the Russian government and the Chechen extremists had achieved their goals; talk of negotiations had ended and Maskhadov&#x27;s reputation had been damaged.

There is also the figure of Arman Menkeev, a retired major in the GRU and a specialist in making explosive devices. He was arrested by the Interior Ministry in November 2002 at the Moscow Oblast base allegedly used by the terrorists but was released shortly afterwards. He may have subsequently been rearrested but was not charged with a crime and is apparently not in custody. FSB officers, who interrogated Menkeev in Lefortovo prison, classified him as &quot;loyal to the Russian government&quot;, adding that &quot;He knows how to keep a military and state secret&quot;. The plastic explosive used by the terrorists was in fact &quot;imitation plastic explosives&quot; which had a &quot;Ministry of Defense origin&quot;. The Moscow City Prosecutor&#x27;s Office claimed that Menkeev could have been the source of this material. Apart from two suicide belts, which were more of a danger to the wearers, the bombs placed in the theater (and elsewhere in Moscow prior to the siege) lacked essential elements like batteries; this provided the required conditions for the successful storming of the theater.

===Moscow lawsuit and the European Court complaint===
After the siege, 61 former hostages sought compensation for physical and emotional suffering totaling almost US$60 million from Moscow city authorities. According to Russia&#x27;s then-new anti-terrorism law, the region where an act of terror occurs should pay compensation for moral and material damages. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov&#x27;s office denounced the suits, saying it could not be held responsible as &quot;the Chechen issue and its consequences are not within the jurisdiction of the Moscow authorities in any way.&quot; The Moscow administration earlier agreed to pay 50,000 roubles ($1,570) in compensation to each former hostage and 100,000 roubles ($3,140) to relatives of those killed. In all but one of the cases, Moscow city courts rejected the compensation claims.

In July 2003, 80 plaintiffs from Russia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and Kazakhstan turned to the European Court for Human Rights, claiming that their right to life had been violated by Russian authorities&#x27; handling of the standoff. In April 2007, Igor Trunov, the claimants&#x27; advocate, reported that the ECHR had finally begun hearings into a complaint filed in 2003 by the victims against the Russian government. Trunov added that not only Russian citizens, but also those from Ukraine, the Netherlands, and Kazakhstan, filed complaints in the Strasbourg Court. The plaintiffs demand €50,000 each in compensation for the violation of their human rights. The case was accepted by the court in December 2007.

On 8 July 2008, &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; reported that the hearings at the European Court of Human Rights will be closed to the public at the request of Russian authorities as, according to Igor Trunov, they &quot;have promised full disclosure on how they handled the crisis&quot;, including &quot;the makeup of the knockout gas used in the storming of the theater by commandos.&quot;

On 20 December 2011, the European Court of Human Rights published its judgement in the case, ordering Russia to pay the 64 applicants a total of 1.3 million euros in compensation. The court also found that Russia had violated Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights when handling the hostage crisis, &quot;with inadequate planning and conduct of the rescue operation&quot;, and with the &quot;authorities&#x27; failure to conduct an effective investigation into the rescue operation&quot;, although the Court found that there had been &quot;no violation of Article 2 of the Convention on account of the decision by the authorities to resolve the hostage crisis by force and to use the gas.&quot;

===Chemical agent mystery and subsequent identification===

It was reported that efforts to treat victims were complicated because the Russian government refused to inform doctors what type of gas had been used. In the records of the official investigation, the agent is referred to as a &quot;gaseous substance&quot;. In other cases, it is referred to as an &quot;unidentified chemical substance&quot;.

The Russian Federation, as a member-state of the Chemical Weapons Convention, undertook &quot;never and under no circumstances to carry out any activities prohibited to member-states of this Convention to develop, to accumulate, to stockpile and to use chemical weapons that can cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm to humans or animals.&quot; The Convention obliges the states to fulfill the conditions of toxic chemicals&#x27; use that allow to exclude or considerably reduce the degree of injury and gravity of consequences. (The Convention allows the use of some chemical agents like tear gas for &quot;law enforcement including domestic riot control&quot;, but requires that &quot;riot control agents&quot; have effects that &quot;disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.&quot;)

Analysis of drug residue from the clothing of two British hostages and the urine of a third British hostage, by a team of researchers at the British chemical and biological defense laboratories at Porton Down, Wiltshire, England, indicated that two fentanyl derivatives had been used. Neither of those two were fentanyl or 3-methylfentanyl (the Russian Minister of Health earlier said that fentanyl or one of its derivatives had been used, but did not specify which derivatives).

The Porton Down analysis by James R. Riches and his colleagues showed that while fentanyl or 3-methylfentanyl were absent from the urine of one survivor and residues of the agent in the clothing of two other British survivors, the veterinary large animal sedative drug carfentanil and anesthetic agent remifentanil were identified by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry in one hostage&#x27;s urine and on the clothing of three hostages who had returned to Britain after the hostage rescue. The authors concluded that carfentanil and remifentanil were used as a mixture in the chemical agent employed by Russian troops to subdue the Chechen terrorists and hostages at the Barricade Theater, perhaps suspended in the anesthetic agent halothane.

==International reaction==

* United NationsIn unanimously adopting Resolution 1440 (2002), the United Nations Security Council condemned the attack and demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The council also expressed their sympathies and condolences to the victims, Russian people, and government of Russia, and urged all states to cooperate with Russian authorities in bringing those responsible to justice.
*Iraqi President Saddam Hussein condemned the attack in a television broadcast, arguing it would ultimately benefit the United States and Israel in undermining Islam: &quot;It&#x27;s not wise for the Chechens to lose the sympathy of Russia and the Russian people. The tyrant of our era is Zionism and America, and not Russia, China or India.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In 2003, HBO broadcast &quot;Terror in Moscow&quot;, a documentary directed by Dan Reed. Interviews with hostages and footage taken inside and outside the theater during the crisis are shown.

In 2004 a documentary by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; investigated the gas that was pumped into the theater.

A Russian DLC released in 2005 for &quot;Postal 2&quot; known as &quot;Штопор ЖжОт&quot; (&quot;Corkscrew Rules&quot;) contains a reference to the attack, in a mission where the protagonist must defend himself from terrorists and police during an attack in a theater.

The 2006 play &quot;In Your Hands&quot; is based on the events of the Moscow theater siege, written by Natalia Pelevine, opened in London at the New End Theatre. In April 2008, Pelevine said that Russian authorities had banned the play following its Russian debut in the city of Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan near Chechnya.

The play &quot;We Declare You a Terrorist&quot;, by Tim J. Lord and based upon the attack, premiered at the 2009 Summer Play Festival.

The 2015 first-person shooter game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot; cites the crisis and FSB response as an inspiration for their hostage rescue game mode.

Part III Episode 6 of the Netflix Spanish drama series &quot;Money Heist&quot; (&quot;La Casa de Papel&quot;) contains spoken references to the theater crisis and the use of halothane gas, with critique of Putin&#x27;s indifference to the fates of the hostages and hostage-takers. In the series, Spanish authorities eventually use halothane gas to assault a bank during a hostage crisis.

In Season 1 Episode 9 of &quot;&quot;, Bulgarian authorities nearly use poison gas to resolve a terrorist hostage-taking in a theater in Sofia, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sent to assist Bulgarian authorities, strongly objects to. The standoff is ultimately resolved without the gas being deployed.

The 2020 film &quot;Conference (Конференция&quot;) follows theater crisis survivor Natasha (Natalya Pavlenko) who returns to the theater to hold a memorial, finally able to confront her survivor&#x27;s guilt and her estranged daughter and husband. The film is by Russian writer and director Igor I. Tverdovskiy.

Christopher Nolan&#x27;s movie &quot;Tenet&quot;, released in August 2020, opens with a prologue that fans and critics have speculated is based on the attack.

<doc id="142012" wikidata="Q208279" url="?curid=142012" title="Highland (council area)">
<text>Highland (, ; ) is a council area in the Scottish Highlands and is the largest local government area in the United Kingdom. It was the 7th most populous council area in Scotland at the 2011 census. It has land borders with the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, Moray and Perth and Kinross. The wider upland area of the Scottish Highlands after which the council area is named extends beyond the Highland council area into all the neighbouring council areas plus Angus and Stirling.

The Highland Region was created covering the area in 1975 as part of a two-tier local government structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. The Highland Region had eight districts. Local government was reorganised again in 1996 into single-tier council areas, with the former region becoming one of the new council areas.

The Highland Council is based in Inverness, the area&#x27;s largest settlement. The area is generally sparsely populated, with much of the inland area being mountainous with numerous lochs. The area includes Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles. Most of the area&#x27;s towns lie close to the eastern coasts. Off the west coast of the mainland the council area includes some of the Inner Hebrides, notably the Isle of Skye.

The Highland area covers the historic counties of Caithness, Inverness-shire, Nairnshire, Ross and Cromarty and Sutherland, with the exception of the parts of Inverness-shire and Ross and Cromarty in the Outer Hebrides. The area also includes an area around Ardnamurchan from the historic county of Argyll and the Grantown-on-Spey area from Moray, which were both transferred to the Highland region as part of the 1975 reforms.

==Name==
Unlike the other council areas of Scotland, the name &quot;Highland&quot; is often not used as a proper noun. The council&#x27;s website only sometimes refers to the area as being &quot;Highland&quot;, and other times as being &quot;the Highland Council Area&quot; or &quot;the Highlands&quot;. Road signs on the boundary of the council area say &quot;Welcome to the Highlands&quot; rather than &quot;Welcome to Highland&quot;.
Although named after it, the Highland council area does not cover the whole of the uplands and cultural region known as the Scottish Highlands. There is no official definition for the wider area, but it is often described to also include parts of the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Stirling or West Dunbartonshire.

==History==
The Highland Region was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which reformed local government across Scotland, replacing the counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Highland was one of the regions, and it was divided into eight districts: Badenoch and Strathspey, Caithness, Inverness, Lochaber, Nairn, Ross and Cromarty, Skye and Lochalsh and Sutherland.

Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with single-tier council areas. The former Highland region became one of the new council areas, run by the Highland Council. The Highland Council has run various area committees since its creation. These were initially based on the abolished districts, but have been reviewed a number of times since.

==Geography==
The council area covers a land area of – which is 11.4% of the land area of Great Britain, 32.9% of the land area of Scotland and an area 20% larger than Wales. The Highland and Islands division of Police Scotland also includes the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland (the former area of the Northern Constabulary) and therefore covers an area of , which is larger than that of the state of Belgium.

Though relatively populous for a Scottish council area, it is also sparsely populated. At per km2 in , the population density is less than one seventh of Scotland&#x27;s as a whole, and comparable with that of Bolivia, Chad and Russia. Historically, the area was home to a much higher percentage of Scotland&#x27;s population. The rural population of the Highlands (both within and outwith the council area) declined in the late 19th century even as Scotland&#x27;s grew substantially. For example, the population of Skye declined from 23,082 in 1841 to 15,705 in 1891 and a low point of 7,183 in 1971, before growing in more recent decades.

The city of Inverness is by far the largest settlement, with its urban area having a population of 59,910 in 2012.

The highest point in the Highland council area is Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in both Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole. Its northernmost point is the Island of Stroma, in the Pentland Firth. Its southernmost point is on the Morvern peninsula. Highland contains the northernmost and westernmost points of the island of Great Britain, respectively at Dunnet Head and . Despite the name, not all of Highland is mountainous. The areas east of Inverness, as well as the Black Isle, eastern Sutherland, and all of Caithness are, in fact, low-lying.

==Gaelic language==
According to the 2011 UK census, there are nearly 12,000 Scottish Gaelic speakers in the Highland area.

==Politics==
The local authority is the Highland Council, based at the Highland Council Headquarters in Inverness (formerly the main offices of Inverness-shire County Council). The council also has numerous local offices across the area.

===Members of the Scottish Parliament===
For elections to the Scottish Parliament the Highland area is within the Highlands and Islands electoral area, which elects eight first past the post constituency Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and seven additional member MSPs. Three of the region&#x27;s constituencies, each electing one MSP, are within the Highland area: Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, Inverness and Nairn and Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

===Members of Parliament===
In the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom the Highland area is represented by Members of Parliament (MPs) elected from four constituencies: Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross; Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire; Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey; and Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber. The latter two straddle the borders with neighbouring council areas. Each constituency elects one MP by the first past the post system of election.

<text>WWT Arundel is one of ten wildfowl and wetland nature reserves managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, a nature conservation charity in the United Kingdom. The reserve is situated at the foot of the Offham Hangar, a part of the Arun valley in Arundel, West Sussex, England.

One of the endangered species protected at the centre is the Hawaiian goose, or nēnē, the rarest goose in the world, and state bird of Hawaii. Many species of duck, goose and swan can be seen at the reserve.

The centre provides a variety of habitats from around the world for its various &#x27;residents&#x27; such as its Coastal Creek aviary exhibit with cut-away diving tank. Visitors can watch sea ducks like long-tailed ducks and Spectacled eiders dive for fish. The Pelican Cove exhibit is home to four female Dalmatian Pelicans with daily Meet the Keeper talks. 

With eight wildlife hides situated all over the site, visitors can get close up views to wildlife including nesting kingfishers and sand martins in spring. The site is noted for its summer wildflowers and roosting marsh harriers in winter. 

Also available each day are Boat Safari rides through reedbed habitats, driven by WWT wildlife guides. The centre is open all year except for Christmas day.

<text>Castle Espie is a wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) on the banks of Strangford Lough, three miles south of Comber, County Down, Northern Ireland, in the townland of the same name. It is part of the Strangford Lough Ramsar Site. It provides an early wintering site for almost the entire Nearctic population of pale-bellied brent geese. The Castle which gave the reserve its name no longer exists.

==Features==

It has the largest collection of ducks, geese and swans in Ireland. In addition to the reserve, the site contains The Kingfisher Kitchen, gift and book shop, The Graffan Gallery, exhibition areas, hides, woodland walks, sensory garden, events and activities, free parking, a picnic area and a reconstruction of a Crannog, an ancient type of dwelling found in Scotland and Ireland from the European Neolithic Period to the early 18th century. The Visitor Centre features award-winning sustainable design including rain water harvesting, natural reed bed filtration systems for waste water, solar power and provides sweeping vistas of the northern shore of Strangford lough from the Kingfisher kitchen.

==History==

There is archaeological evidence from the Mesolithic period at the site.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, lime was quarried at the site, and processed in Hoffmann kilns. In the nineteenth century, there were also brickworks on the site.

The site has been managed by WWT since 1990.

==&quot;Springwatch,&quot; &quot;Autumnwatch and Winterwatch&quot;==

In 2021 Castle Espie was used as a filming location for the BBC wildlife series Springwatch and &quot;Autumnwatch&quot; presented by Gillian Burke and in January 2022 &quot;Winterwatch&quot; presented by Megan McCubbin

==Townland==
Castle Espie () is also a townland of 255 acres in the civil parish of Tullynakill and the historic barony of Castlereagh Lower.

<text>WWT London Wetland Centre is a wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust in the Barnes area of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, southwest London, England, by Barn Elms. The site is formed of four disused Victorian reservoirs tucked into a loop in the Thames.

The centre first opened in 2000, and in 2002 an area of 29.9 hectares was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest as the &quot;Barn Elms Wetland Centre&quot;.

The centre occupies more than 100 acres (40 hectares) of land which was formerly occupied by several small reservoirs. These were converted into a wide range of wetland features and habitats before the centre opened in May 2000. It was the first urban project of its kind in the United Kingdom.

Many wild birds which have now made their home in the centre cannot be found anywhere else in London, and there are nationally significant numbers of gadwall and northern shoveler. Other wild birds include Eurasian bittern, northern pintail, northern lapwing, water rail, ring-necked parakeet, Eurasian sparrowhawk, sand martin, common kingfisher, little grebe and great crested grebe. The centre also holds a collection of captive wildfowl.

It is host to regular lectures and events concerned with preserving Britain&#x27;s wetland animals and was featured on the BBC television programme Seven Natural Wonders in 2005 as one of the wonders of the London area, with a focus on the region&#x27;s parakeets, in an episode presented by Bill Oddie. The site contains a large visitors&#x27; building which is occasionally used as a wedding venue.

In 2012 WWT London Wetland Centre was voted Britain&#x27;s Favourite Nature Reserve in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards. The site received 190,206 visitors during 2019.

<text>WWT Llanelli Wetland Centre at Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales is one of ten wetland nature reserves in the UK managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, a nature conservation charity. The visitor centre has accessible toilets, a coffee shop and retail area. During school holidays, there are nature-based activities and events.

==Location==

The reserve is situated east of Llanelli and north of Swansea in south Wales, on the eastern side of Carmarthen Bay. It is part of the Burry Inlet estuary which is an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), an SPA (Special Protection Area), and a Ramsar site.

With many ecologically important wetland habitats, the site is a vital refuge for some of the world&#x27;s most endangered migratory birds, many of which are rare or endangered.

In autumn and winter, more than 60,000 birds return here to overwinter. Threatened species protected at the centre include little egret, lapwing, water vole, black-tailed godwit and many more.

<doc id="142021" wikidata="Q7957495" url="?curid=142021" title="WWT Martin Mere">
<text>WWT Martin Mere is a wetland nature reserve and wildfowl collection managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Tarlscough, Burscough, Lancashire, England, on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, from Ormskirk and from Southport (Merseyside). It is one of ten reserves managed by the charity, and it is designated an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), an SPA (Special Protection Area) and a Ramsar Site.

The name of the centre comes from the mere on the west side of the reserve which is ringed by more than ten observation hides. On the east side of the reserve there are a number of pens providing habitats for birds from Africa, Australasia, North America, South America, Siberia, and Asia.

Martin Mere has its own &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, listing (for 2002) nationally important species of wildlife found at the reserve, other than birds include the whorled caraway (&quot;Carum verticillatum &quot;), at its only site in England away from the southwest, and the regionally scarce water dropwort (&quot;Oenanthe fistulosa&quot;). Another sign of the sites importance for biodiversity is the recording of the first records of the micromoth, the marsh dowd (&quot;Blastobasis rebeli&quot;), for northern England.

This reserve is at its best in winter, attracting huge flocks of pink-footed geese and Eurasian wigeon, many whooper swans and occasional rarer birds such as the snow goose. It is also excellent for wintering birds of prey such as hen harrier, peregrine and merlin.

The BBC television programme Autumnwatch was broadcast live from Martin Mere in 2006 and 2007.

==History==

Martin Mere was initially opened to members of the Wildfowl Trust in late 1974 and then in March 1975 it was opened to the general public. The reserve and centre were the concept of haulage contractor, Ronnie Barker, who was a friend of Sir Peter Scott. Barker was aware that both pink footed geese and Bewick&#x27;s swans roosted at Martin Mere and was able to arrange a meeting between Sir Peter and the then landowner, this resulted in Sir Peter buying for £52,000. The first warden of the reserve was Peter Gladstone (1928–2000).

<text>WWT Slimbridge is a wetland wildlife reserve near Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, England. It is midway between Bristol and Gloucester on the eastern side of the estuary of the River Severn. The reserve, set up by the artist and naturalist Sir Peter Scott, opened in November 1946. Scott subsequently founded the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust, which has since opened nine other reserves around the country. Slimbridge comprises some of pasture, reed bed, lagoon and salt marsh. Many water birds live there all year round, and others are migrants on their ways to and from their summer breeding grounds. Other birds overwinter, including large numbers of white-fronted geese and increasing numbers of Bewick&#x27;s swans.

Besides having the world&#x27;s largest collection of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured patterns on the beaks of Bewick&#x27;s swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.

==History==

The Wildlife and Wetland Trust at Slimbridge was set up by Peter Scott and opened on 10 November 1946, as a centre for research and conservation. In a move unusual at the time, he opened the site to the public so that everyone could enjoy access to nature.

This modest beginning developed in time into the formation of the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust, the only United Kingdom charity to promote the protection of wetland birds and their habitats, both in Britain and internationally. Although starting out at Slimbridge, the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust now owns or manages nine other reserves in Britain, and advocates for wetlands and conservation issues world-wide. WWT Consulting is an offshoot of the Wildlife &amp; Wetland Trust and is based at Slimbridge. It provides ecological surveys and assessments, and offers consultancy services in wetland habitat design, wetland management, biological waste-water treatment systems and the management of reserves and their visitor centres. The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles became the President.

A bust of founder Sir Peter Scott by Jacqueline Shackleton was completed in 1986 and is on display in the grounds. His wife Philippa, Lady Scott, sat for Jon Edgar as part of his Environmental Series of heads, and a bronze was unveiled in the visitor centre in December 2011. A sculpture by Peter Scott&#x27;s mother, Kathleen Scott, entitled: &quot;Here Am I, Send Me&quot;, originally commissioned for West Downs Preparatory School, is also on display in the grounds.

==Site==

The site consists of of reserve, of which part is landscaped and can be visited by the public. At Slimbridge is the largest collection of wildfowl species in the world, and wild birds mingle with these in the enclosures. Some of the captive birds form part of international breeding programmes. The reserve includes a mixture of pastureland, much of which gets flooded in winter, lagoons, reed beds and salt marshes besides the Severn Estuary. Many wildfowl visit the site including greater white-fronted geese, Eurasian spoonbills, pied avocets and even common cranes, the latter being birds that were originally bred here and later released on the Somerset Levels. There are also some rare species of plant on the reserve including the grass-poly (&quot;Lythrum hyssopifolia&quot;) and the wasp orchid, a variant of the bee orchid (&quot;Ophrys apifera&quot;).

The number of ducks, geese and swans is greatest in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes with a rare lesser white-fronted goose amongst them. Bewick&#x27;s swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, and it is a good place to see the elusive water rail.

Species present all year round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, sparrowhawk and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include Eurasian whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include northern wheatear, whinchat, common redstart and black redstart.

Swans and geese usually start to arrive in late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, black-tailed godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick&#x27;s swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large waterfowl regularly present in the reserve in winter include the brent goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off in the day and return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, common snipe and ruff.

==Projects==
Before the establishment of the WWT reserve at Slimbridge, no Bewick&#x27;s swans were regularly wintering on the Severn Estuary. In 1948, one arrived at Slimbridge, perhaps attracted by a captive whistling swan. A mate for this bird was acquired from the Netherlands and the pair eventually successfully bred. More wild Bewick&#x27;s swans joined the group so that by 1964, more than thirty wild swans were present. So that the birds could be better studied, the tame resident swans were relocated to an easily observable lake. Peter Scott realised that every bird had a unique patterning of black and yellow on its beak by which individual birds could be recognised. These were recorded in small paintings with front and side views (rather like &quot;mug shots&quot;) to aid recognition. By 1989, over six thousand swans had been recorded visiting the site, and by this means, much research was made possible on the birds.
An early success story in the 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds were brought to the site and breeding at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene&#x27;s natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.

During Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s 1951 tour of Canada, she was promised a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the arrangements to be made by Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia as they had been fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.

Slimbridge has also been involved in trying to increase population levels of common cranes, which had bred spasmodically in Britain since the late 1970s. A specially built &quot;Crane School&quot; is used where the young birds are taught to forage and avoid danger. This project has led to 23 birds being released onto the Somerset Moors and Levels in September 2013, and 93 being released by the end of 2015.

In September 2016, a researcher from Slimbridge is planning to become a &quot;human swan&quot; and follow migrating Bewick&#x27;s swans using a powered paraglider. She plans to try to find out the hazards they face during migration and why their numbers have halved in the last twenty years. The mission from the Arctic tundra of Russia to Slimbridge is expected to last for ten weeks.

==Facilities==

The Sloane Observation Tower gives far-reaching views to the Cotswold escarpment in the east and the River Severn and Forest of Dean in the West. The £6.2m visitor centre has a shop, waterside restaurant, cinema, art gallery and tropical house, and exhibitions are held in the &quot;Hanson Discovery Centre&quot;. There are sixteen hides that visitors can use for bird watching, as well as several comfortable observatories. Educational visits are available for schools and there is a programme of guided walks, events, talks and workshops.

Visitors are allowed to feed the captive birds with approved food mixes bought on site, and during the winter, feeding of wild birds near one of the hides takes place at certain scheduled times, including on some floodlit occasions in the evening for visiting groups.

<text>WWT Washington Wetland Centre is a wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Washington, Tyne and Wear, North East England. 

Established in 1975, its wildlife includes swans, geese, ducks, a family of Asian short clawed otters and a flock of Chilean flamingos. WWT works towards the conservation of wetlands and has a successful breeding program for some of the world&#x27;s most endangered wildfowl.

Included in the site is a nature reserve with hides to watch the wildlife, a saline lagoon and dragonfly ponds in which large species of dragonfly live along with newts, frogs and toads.

The park sells bags of seed that can be used to get an up-close and personal encounter with most of their birds whilst feeding them.

Species kept at the park include:
*Andean goose
*Baer&#x27;s pochard
*Black necked swan
*Black swan
*Chilean flamingo
*Common crane
*Eider
*Hawaiian goose

<doc id="142027" wikidata="Q1259218" url="?curid=142027" title="Third Battle of Panipat">
<text>The Third Battle of Panipat took place on 14 January 1761 between the Maratha Confederacy and the invading army of the Durrani Empire. The battle took place in and around the city of Panipat, approximately north of Delhi. The Afghans were supported by three key allies in India: Najib ad-Dawlah who persuaded the support of the Rohilla chiefs, elements of the declining Mughal Empire, and most prized the Oudh State under Shuja-ud-Daula. Mughal Nobles were able to persuade Maharaja Deep Chand of the Kingdom of Kumaon, an old Himalayan ally of the Mughal Empire, to support the Afghan side in the battle. The Maratha army was led by Sadashivrao Bhau, who was third-highest authority of the Maratha Confederacy after the Chhatrapati and the Peshwa. The bulk of the Maratha army was stationed in the Deccan Plateau with the Peshwa.

Militarily, the battle pitted the artillery, musketry, and cavalry of the Marathas against the heavy cavalry, musketry (&quot;jezail&quot;) and mounted artillery (&quot;zamburak&quot;) of the Afghans and the Rohillas led by Abdali and Najib ad-Dawlah. The battle is considered to have been one of the largest and most eventful fought in the 18th century, and it had perhaps the largest number of fatalities in a single day reported in a classic formation battle between two armies.

The battle lasted for several days and involved over 125,000 troops; protracted skirmishes occurred, with losses and gains on both sides. The Afghan army ultimately emerged victorious from the battle after successfully destroying several Maratha flanks. The extent of the losses on both sides is heavily disputed by historians, but it is believed that between 60,000 and 70,000 troops were killed in the fighting, while the numbers of injured and prisoners taken vary considerably. According to the single-best eyewitness chronicle—the &quot;bakhar&quot; by Shuja-ud-Daula&#x27;s &quot;Diwan Kashi Raja&quot;—about 40,000 Maratha prisoners were collectively slaughtered on the day after the battle. British historian Grant Duff includes an interview of a survivor of these massacres in his &quot;History of the Marathas&quot; and generally corroborates this number. Shejwalkar, whose monograph &quot;Panipat 1761&quot; is often regarded as the single-best secondary source on the battle, says that &quot;not less than 100,000 Marathas (soldiers and non-combatants) perished during and after the battle&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1757, Ahmad Shah Durrani appointed his son, Timur Shah, as the governor of Punjab. Since Timur Shah was a minor, the Durrani commander-in-chief, Jahan Khan, assumed control of the administration. Jahan Khan&#x27;s rule was harsh—he forced Adina Beg Khan, the governor of Jalandhar Doab, to retreat to the hills and persecuted Sodhi Wadbhag Singh of Kartarpur. Determined to retaliate, Adina Beg Khan allied with Jassa Singh Ahluwalia by paying a large tribute and permitting the Sikhs to plunder the Jalandhar Doab and defeated the Afghans at Battle of Mahilpur (1757). By March 1758, Adina Beg Khan became uneasy with the growing influence of the Sikhs. He sought help from the Marathas, who had gained control of Delhi after defeating the Mughals in the Battle of Delhi (1757). Adina Beg offered the Marathas a large daily payment to assist him in capturing Lahore. Additionally, he persuaded the Sikhs to join forces with the Marathas against the Afghans. Adina Beg also gained the support of Raghunathrao and together they drove the Afghans out of Lahore. The Maratha and Sikh forces then pursued the retreating Afghans on horseback, eventually capturing Attock. The Punjab now came under Maratha rule, with Adina appointed subahdar of the Punjab in 1758 in return for a yearly tribute of seventy five lakh of rupees. Raghunathrao and Malhar Rao Holkar, the two commanders-in-chief of the Maratha forces, remained in Lahore for three months after which they retired to the Deccan leaving Adina in sole control.

This brought the Marathas into direct confrontation with the Durrani Empire of Ahmad Shāh Abdali. In 1759, he raised an army the core of which was from the Qizilbash, and recruited other troops such as the Pashtun tribes, Kurds, and Uzbeks. and made several gains against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Punjab. He then joined his Indian allies—the Rohillas of the Gangetic Doab, the Muslims of Northern India, and Shuja-ud-Daula—forming a broad coalition against the Marathas.

To counter this, Raghunathrao was supposed to go north to handle the situation. Raghunathrao asked for large number of an army soldiers, which was denied by Sadashivrao Bhau, his cousin and Diwan of Peshwa. Therefore, he declined to go. Sadashivrao Bhau was instead made commander in chief of the Maratha Army, under whom the Battle of Panipat was fought.

The Marathas, under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau, responded by gathering an army of between 45,000 and 60,000, which was accompanied by roughly 200,000 non-combatants, a number of whom were pilgrims desirous of making pilgrimages to Hindu holy sites in northern India. The Marathas started their northward journey from Patdur on 14 March 1760. Both sides tried to get the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah, into their camp. By late July Shuja-ud-Daulah made the decision to join the Afghan-Rohilla coalition, preferring to join what was perceived as the &quot;army of Islam&quot;. This was strategically a major loss for the Marathas, since Shuja provided much-needed finances for the long Afghan stay in North India. It is doubtful whether the Afghan-Rohilla coalition would have the means to continue their conflict with the Marathas without Shuja&#x27;s support.

=== Rise of the Marathas ===
Grant Duff, describing the Maratha army:

The Marathas had gained control of a considerable part of India in the intervening period (1712–1757). In 1758 they nominally occupied Delhi, captured Lahore and drove out Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of the Afghan ruler, Ahmad Shah Abdali. This was the high-water mark of Maratha expansion, where the boundaries of their empire extended north of the Sindhu river all the way down south to northern Kerala. This territory was ruled through the Peshwa, who talked of placing his son Vishwasrao on the Mughal throne. However, Delhi still remained under the control of Mughals, key Muslim intellectuals including Shah Waliullah and other Muslim clergies in India were frightened at these developments. In desperation they appealed to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the ruler of Afghanistan, to halt the threat. The Marathas attempted to turn over the support of the Gujarati Muslim Babis, the Indian Rohillas, Nizam brothers of the Deccan, and Shuja-ud-Dawlah.

== Prelude ==
Ahmad Shah Durrani (&quot;Ahmad Shah Abdali&quot;), angered by the news from his son and his allies, was unwilling to allow the Marathas&#x27; spread go unchecked. By the end of 1759 Abdali with his Qizilbash and the Afghan tribes, had reached Lahore as well as Delhi and defeated the smaller enemy garrisons, and was joined by the Muslims of Northern India, the Rohillas, and Shuja-ud-Daula. Ahmed Shah, at this point, withdrew his army to Anupshahr, on the frontier of the Rohilla country, where he successfully convinced the Nawab of Oudh Shuja-ud-Daula to join his alliance against the Marathas. The Marathas had earlier helped Safdarjung (father of Shuja) in defeating Rohillas in Farrukhabad.

The Marathas under Sadashivrao Bhau responded to the news of the Afghans&#x27; return to North India by raising an army, and they marched North. Bhau&#x27;s force was bolstered by some Maratha forces under Holkar, Scindia, Gaikwad and Govind Pant Bundele. Suraj Mal (the Jat ruler of Bharatpur) also had joined Bhausaheb initially. This combined army captured the Mughal capital, Delhi, from an Afghan garrison in December 1759. Delhi had been reduced to ashes many times due to previous invasions, and in addition there being acute shortage of supplies in the Maratha camp. Bhau ordered the sacking of the already depopulated city. He is said to have planned to place his nephew and the Peshwa&#x27;s son, Vishwasrao, on the Delhi throne. The Jats withdrew their support from the Marathas. Their withdrawal from the ensuing battle was to play a crucial role in its result. The first blood was drawn when the leader of the Rohillas, an Indian Muslim named Qutb Khan, attacked a small Maratha army led by Dattaji Shinde at Burari Ghat. Dattaji camped at the Buradi Fort, south of Panipat, deciding to only engage with Abdali with the aid of Malharao Holkar. He was beheaded and killed in an attack by Qutb Khan.

===Suraj Mal&#x27;s advice to Sadashiv Rao Bhau===
Before Battle of Panipat a war council was formed by Maratha commander-in-chief Sadashiv Rao Bhau in which Maharaja Suraj Mal was invited to give advice for war strategy against Abdali.

Jat chief Surajmal provided following advice :

* Women, children, old people, families of soldier and non combatants should either be left on the other side of Chambal in Maratha&#x27;s stronghold of Jhansi and Gwalior or in protection of Suraj Mal’s one of 4 forts in Jat strongholds.
* Large baggage and heavy artillery should not be taken as they will slow down Maratha movement in the battlefield against Durrani’s forces.
* If Marathas find themselves on losing ground then a quick moving force will be able to move backwards in friendly country easily and Abdali will not be keen on crossing Chambal.
* Road for supply lines should be kept open so that Maratha army will not face problems in getting supplies during war 
* One division of the Maratha army should be sent to Lahore and other to the east to destroy the supply lines so that Abdali will not be able to secure supplies from his allies for his army.
* A light cavalry guerrilla warfare will be suggested instead of conventional face-to-face warfare as Durrani will not be able to sustain a long warfare and when Monsoon will come both sides will find forces moving much slower, Durrani will be in much more disadvantage without supplies compared to Marathas and this will force Abdali to move back to his country.

Many of the Maratha generals found it good strategy as they themselves prefer guerrilla warfare but Sadashiv Rao Bhau found it dishonourable for a king and took this as result of Maratha general&#x27;s old age and Suraj Mal&#x27;s foolishness.

== Skirmishes before the battle ==

=== Afghan defeat at Kunjpura ===

With both sides poised for battle, maneuvering followed, with skirmishes between the two armies fought around Karnal and Kunjpura. Abdus Samad Khan, the faujdar of Sirhind, had come to Kunjpura, on the banks of the Yamuna river 60 miles to the north of Delhi with a force of more than ten thousand and supplies for the Afghan force. Kunjpura was stormed by the Marathas who was running short of supplies. Aided by the musketeers under Ibrahim Gardi, the Marathas achieved a rather easy victory at Kunjpura against an army of around 15,000 Afghans posted there. Some of Abdali&#x27;s best generals like Najabat Khan were killed. Abdus Samad Khan, the faujdar of Sirhind, was also killed during the battle. Mian Qutb Shah, who was responsible for beheading Dattaji Shinde at the Battle of Barari Ghat was executed by the Marathas after their capture of Kunjpura. Ahmad Shah was encamped on the left bank of the Yamuna River, which was swollen by rains, and was powerless to aid the garrison. The whole Afghan garrison was killed or enslaved. The massacre of the Kunjpura garrison, within sight of the Durrani camp, exasperated Abdali to such an extent that he ordered crossing of the river at all costs.

=== Afghans cross Yamuna and the Battles of Samalkha and Meerut ===

Ahmed Shah and his allies on 17 October 1760, broke up from Shahdara, marching south. Taking a calculated risk, Abdali plunged into the river, followed by his bodyguards and troops. Between 23 and 25 October they were able to cross at Baghpat(a small town about 24 miles up the river), unopposed by the Marathas who were still preoccupied with the sacking of Kunjpura and visit to nearby Kurukshetra; an important Hindu pilgrimage destination.

After the Marathas failed to prevent Abdali&#x27;s forces from crossing the Yamuna River, they set up defensive works in the ground near Panipat, thereby blocking his access back to Afghanistan, just as Abdali&#x27;s forces blocked theirs to the south. However, on the afternoon of 26 October, Ahmad Shah&#x27;s advance guard reached Samalkha, about halfway between Sonepat and Panipat, where they encountered the vanguard of the Marathas. A fierce skirmish ensued, in which the Afghans lost 1000 men but drove the Marathas back to their main body, which kept retreating slowly for several days. This led to the partial encirclement of the Maratha army. In skirmishes that followed, Govind Pant Bundele, with 10,000 light cavalry who weren&#x27;t formally trained soldiers, was on a foraging mission with about 500 men. They were surprised by an Afghan force near Meerut, and in the ensuing fight, Bundele was killed. This was followed by the loss of a contingent of 2,000 Maratha soldiers who had left Delhi to deliver money and rations to Panipat. This completed the encirclement, as Ahmad Shah had cut off the Maratha army&#x27;s supply lines.

With supplies and stores dwindling, tensions started rising in the Maratha camp. Initially the Marathas had moved in almost 150 pieces of modern long-range, French-made artillery. With a range of several kilometres, these guns were some of the best of the time. The Marathas&#x27; plan was to lure the Afghan army to confront them while they had close artillery support.

=== Preliminary moves ===
During the next two months of the siege, constant skirmishes and duels took place between units from the two sides. In one of these Najib lost 3,000 of his Rohillas and was nearly killed himself. Facing a potential stalemate, Abdali decided to seek terms, which Bhau was willing to consider. However, Najib Khan delayed any chance of an agreement with an appeal on religious grounds and sowed doubt about whether the Marathas would honour any agreement.

After the Marathas moved from Kunjpura to Panipat, Diler Khan Marwat, with his father Alam Khan Marwat and a force of 2500 Pashtuns, attacked and took control of Kunjpura, where there was a Maratha garrison of 700–800 soldiers. At that time Atai Khan Baluch, son of the Shah Wali Khan, the Wazir of Abdali, came from Afghanistan with 10,000 cavalry and cut off the supplies to the Marathas. The Marathas at Panipat were surrounded by Abdali in the south, Pashtun tribes (Yousufzai, Afridi, Khattak) in the east, Shuja, Atai Khan and others in the north and other Pashtun tribes (Gandapur, Marwat, Durranis and Kakars) in the west.
Unable to continue without supplies or wait for reinforcements from Pune any longer, Bhau decided to break the siege. His plan was to pulverise the enemy formations with cannon fire and not to employ his cavalry until the Afghans were thoroughly softened up. With the Afghans broken, he would move camp in a defensive formation towards Delhi, where they were assured supplies.

=== Formations ===

With the Maratha chiefs pressurizing Sadashivrao Bhau, to go to battle rather than perish by starvation, on 13 January, the Marathas left their camp before dawn and marched south towards the Afghan camp in a desperate attempt to break the siege. The two armies came face-to-face around 8:00 a.m.

The Maratha lines began a little to the north of Kala Amb. They had thus blocked the northward path of Abdali&#x27;s troops and at the same time were blocked from heading south—in the direction of Delhi, where they could get badly needed supplies—by those same troops. Bhau, with the Peshwa&#x27;s son and the royal guard (Huzurat), was in the centre. The left wing consisted of the &quot;Gardis&quot; under Ibrahim Khan. Holkar and Sindhia were on the extreme right.

The Maratha line was formed up some 12 km across, with the artillery in front, protected by infantry, pikemen, musketeers and bowmen. The cavalry was instructed to wait behind the artillery and bayonet-wielding musketeers, ready to be thrown in when control of the battlefield had been fully established. Behind this line was another ring of 30,000 young Maratha soldiers who were not battle-tested, and then the civilians. Many were ordinary men, women and children on their pilgrimage to Hindu holy places and shrines. Behind the civilians was yet another protective infantry line, of young, inexperienced soldiers.

On the other side the Afghans formed a somewhat similar line, a few metres to the south of today&#x27;s Sanauli Road. Their left was being formed by Najib and their right by two brigades of troops. Their left centre was led by two Viziers, Shuja-ud-daulah with 3,000 soldiers and 50–60 cannons and Ahmad Shah&#x27;s Vizier Shah Wali with a choice body of 19,000 mailed Afghan horsemen. The right centre consisted of 15,000 Rohillas under Hafiz Rahmat and other chiefs of the Rohilla Pathans. Pasand Khan covered the left wing with 5,000 cavalry, Barkurdar Khan and Amir Beg covered the right with 3,000 Rohilla cavalry. Long-range musketeers were also present during the battle. In this order the army of Ahmed Shah moved forward, leaving him at his preferred post in the centre, which was now in the rear of the line, from where he could watch and direct the battle.

== Battle ==
=== Early phases ===

Before dawn on 14 January 1761, the Maratha troops broke their fast with sugared water in the camp and prepared for combat. They emerged from the trenches, pushing the artillery into position on their prearranged lines, some 2 km from the Afghans. Seeing that the battle was on, Ahmad Shah positioned his 60 smooth-bore cannon and opened fire.

The initial attack was led by the Maratha left flank under Ibrahim Khan, who advanced his infantry in formation against the Rohillas and Shah Pasand Khan. The first salvos from the Maratha artillery went over the Afghans&#x27; heads and did very little damage. Nevertheless, the first Afghan attack by Najib Khan&#x27;s Rohillas was broken by Maratha bowmen and pikemen, along with a unit of the famed Gardi musketeers stationed close to the artillery positions. The second and subsequent salvos were fired at point-blank range into the Afghan ranks. The resulting carnage sent the Rohillas reeling back to their lines, leaving the battlefield in the hands of Ibrahim for the next three hours, during which the 8,000 Gardi musketeers killed about 12,000 Rohillas.

In the second phase, Bhau himself led the charge against the left-of-center Afghan forces, under the Afghan Vizier Shah Wali Khan. The sheer force of the attack nearly broke the Afghan lines, and the Afghan soldiers started to desert their positions in the confusion. Desperately trying to rally his forces, Shah Wali appealed to Shuja ud Daulah for assistance. However, the Nawab did not break from his position, effectively splitting the Afghan force&#x27;s center. Despite Bhau&#x27;s success and the ferocity of the charge, the attack did not attain complete success as many of the half-starved Maratha mounts were exhausted. Also, there were no heavy armoured cavalry units for the Marathas to maintain these openings. In order to turn about the deserting Afghan troopers, Abdali deployed his Nascibchi musketeers to gun down the deserters who finally stopped and returned to the field.

=== Final phase ===

The Marathas, under Scindia, attacked Najib. Najib successfully fought a defensive action, however, keeping Scindia&#x27;s forces at bay. By noon it looked as though Bhau would clinch victory for the Marathas once again. The Afghan left flank still held its own, but the centre was cut in two and the right was almost destroyed. Ahmad Shah had watched the fortunes of the battle from his tent, guarded by the still unbroken forces on his left. He sent his bodyguards to call up his 15,000 reserve troops from his camp and arranged them as a column in front of his cavalry of musketeers (Qizilbash) and 2,000 swivel-mounted &quot;shutarnaals&quot; or Ushtranaal—cannons—on the backs of camels.

The shutarnaals, because of their positioning on camels, could fire an extensive salvo over the heads of their own infantry, at the Maratha cavalry. The Maratha cavalry was unable to withstand the muskets and camel-mounted swivel cannons of the Afghans. They could be fired without the rider having to dismount and were especially effective against fast-moving cavalry. Abdali therefore, sent 500 of his own bodyguards with orders to raise all able-bodied men out of camp and send them to the front. He sent 1,500 more to punish the front-line troops who attempted to flee the battle and kill without mercy any soldier who would not return to the fight. These extra troops, along with 4,000 of his reserve troops, went to support the broken ranks of the Rohillas on the right. The remainder of the reserve, 10,000 strong, were sent to the aid of Shah Wali, still labouring unequally against the Bhau in the centre of the field. These mailed warriors were to charge with the Vizier in close order and at full gallop. Whenever they charged the enemy in front, the chief of the staff and Najib were directed to fall upon either flank.

With their own men in the firing line, the Maratha artillery could not respond to the shathurnals and the cavalry charge. Some 7,000 Maratha cavalry and infantry were killed before the hand-to-hand fighting began at around 14:00 hrs. By 16:00 hrs, the tired Maratha infantry began to succumb to the onslaught of attacks from fresh Afghan reserves, protected by armoured leather jackets.

=== Outflanked ===

Sadashiv Rao Bhau who had not kept any reserves, seeing his forward lines dwindling, civilians behind and upon seeing Vishwasrao disappear in the midst of the fighting, felt he had no choice but to come down from his elephant and lead the battle.

Taking advantage of this, the Afghan soldiers who had been captured by the Marathas earlier during the Siege of Kunjpura revolted. The prisoners unwrapped their green belts and wore them as turbans to impersonate the troops of the Durrani Empire and began attacking from within. This brought confusion and great consternation to the Maratha soldiers, who thought that the enemy had attacked from the rear. Some Maratha troops in the vanguard, seeing that their general had disappeared from his elephant and the chaos ensuing in the rear, panicked and scattered in disarray towards the rear.

Abdali had given a part of his army the task of surrounding and killing the Gardis, who were at the leftmost part of the Maratha army. Bhausaheb had ordered Vitthal Vinchurkar (with 1500 cavalry) and Damaji Gaikwad (with 2500 cavalry) to protect the Gardis. However, after seeing the Gardis having no clearing for directing their cannon fire at the enemy troops, they lost their patience and decided to fight the Rohillas themselves. Thus, they broke their position and went all out on the Rohillas. The Rohilla riflemen started accurately firing at the Maratha cavalry, which was equipped only with swords. This gave the Rohillas the opportunity to encircle the Gardis and outflank the Maratha centre while Shah Wali pressed on attacking the front. Thus the Gardis were left defenseless and started falling one by one.

Vishwasrao had already been killed by a shot to the head. Bhau and the Huzurati royal forces fought till the end, the Maratha leader having three horses shot out from under him. At this stage, the Holkar and Scindia contingents, realising the battle was lost, merged their forces with one contingent breaking from the Maratha right flank and escaped from the opening in the Durrani lines southwards as Jankoji Rao Scindia lead the other contingent to reinforce the thinning lines of Marathas. The Maratha front lines remained largely intact, with some of their artillery units fighting until sunset. Choosing not to launch a night attack, many Maratha troops escaped that night. Bhau&#x27;s wife Parvatibai, who was assisting in the administration of the Maratha camp, escaped to Pune with her bodyguard, Janu Bhintada along with Nana Fadnavis under the protection of Malhar Rao Holkar&#x27;s contingent. Some 15,000 soldiers managed to reach Gwalior.

== Reasons for the outcome ==
Durrani had both numeric as well as qualitative superiority over Marathas. The combined Afghan army was much larger than that of Marathas. Though the infantry of Marathas was organized along European lines and their army had some of the best French-made guns of the time, their artillery was static and lacked mobility against the fast-moving Afghan forces. The heavy mounted artillery of Afghans proved much better in the battlefield than the light artillery of Marathas. None of the other Hindu kings joined forces to fight Abdali. Allies of Abdali, namely, Najib, Shuja and the Rohillas knew North India very well. He was also diplomatic, striking agreements with Hindu leaders, especially the Jats and Rajputs, and former rivals like the Nawab of Awadh, appealing to him in the name of religion.

Moreover, the senior Maratha chiefs constantly bickered with one another. Each had ambitions of carving out their independent states and had no interest in fighting against a common enemy. Some of them did not support the idea of a &quot;pitched battle&quot; and wanted to fight using guerrilla tactics instead of charging the enemy head-on. The Marathas were fighting alone at a place which was 1000 miles away from their capital Pune.

Raghunathrao was supposed to go north to reinforce the army. Raghunathrao asked for large amount of wealth and troops, which was denied by Sadashivrao Bhau, his cousin and Diwan of Peshwa, so he declined to go. Sadashivrao Bhau was there upon made commander in chief of the Maratha Army, under whom the Battle of Panipat was fought. Some historians have opined, that Peshwa&#x27;s decision to appoint Sadashivrao Bhau as the Supreme Commander instead of Malharrao Holkar or Raghunathrao proved to be an unfortunate one, as Sadashivrao was totally ignorant of the political and military situation in North India.

If Holkar had remained in the battlefield, the Maratha defeat would have been delayed but not averted. Ahmad Shah&#x27;s superiority in pitched battle could&#x27;ve been averted by guerrilla warfare, as advised by Malharrao Holkar and Suraj Mal. However it is described as impossible to implement due to the camp followers of Bhau&#x27;s army, and the general quality of his men. It is also believed that the Afghans would not be susceptible to such tactics, due to the Afghan horses being able to outmaneuver the Marathas in battle. Abdali was in no position to maintain his field army in India indefinitely due to external threats.

== Massacres after the battle ==
After the defeat the Marathas fled in all directions, and the Afghans, Mughals, Rohillas and Awadh troops fell upon them and were busy in plundering and slaying soldiers and civilians. Afghan officers who had lost their kin in battle were permitted to carry out massacres of Marathas the next day also, in Panipat and the surrounding area. They arranged victory mounds of severed heads outside their camps. According to the single best eyewitness chronicle – the bakhar by Shuja-ud-Daula&#x27;s Diwan Casi Raja(Kashi Raja) – about 40,000 Maratha prisoners were slaughtered in cold blood the day after the battle. According to Hamilton, a reporter of the Bombay Gazette, about half a million Marathi people were present there in Panipat town and he gives a figure of 40,000 prisoners as executed by Afghans. Qutb Shah&#x27;s son slaughtered 4,000 fugitives near Sonepat and Abdus Samad Khan&#x27;s son killed 5,000 near Bahadurgad, to avenge their fathers deaths. Some 22,000 women and children were driven off as slaves.

All of the prisoners were transported on bullock carts, camels and elephants in bamboo cages. most of whom were saved by Sikhs led by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. Thereafter, he was known as &quot;Bandi chhor&quot;, or the Liberator of captives.

Siyar-ut-Mutakhirin says:

== Aftermath ==

The bodies of Vishwasrao and Bhau were recovered by the Marathas and were cremated according to their custom. Bhau&#x27;s wife Parvatibai was saved by Holkar, per the directions of Bhau, and eventually returned to Pune.

Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, uninformed about the state of his army, was crossing the Narmada with a relief force and supplies when he heard of the defeat. He returned to Pune and never recovered from the shock of the debacle at Panipat. According to Kashi Raja Pundit, &quot;It was Balaji Bajirao&#x27;s love of pleasure which was responsible for Panipat. He delayed at Paithan celebrating his second marriage until December 27, when it was too late.&quot;

Jankoji Scindia was taken prisoner and executed at the instigation of Najib. Ibrahim Khan Gardi was tortured and executed by enraged Afghan soldiers. The Marathas never fully recovered from the loss at Panipat, but they remained the largest empire in the Indian subcontinent and managed to retake Delhi ten years later. However, their claim over all of India ended with the three Anglo-Maratha Wars, in the early 19th century.

These circumstances made Abdali leave India at the earliest. Before departing, he ordered the Indian chiefs, through a Royal Firman (order) (including Clive of India), to recognise Shah Alam II as Emperor.

Ahmad Shah also appointed Najib-ud-Daula as ostensible regent to the Mughal Emperor. In addition, Najib and Munir-ud-daulah agreed to pay to Abdali, on behalf of the Mughal emperor, an annual tribute of four million rupees, which was never actually paid. On March 1761, Ahmad Shah left for Afghanistan. As he traveled through Punjab, his forces were often troubled by the Sikhs. After crossing the Sutlej River, the Sikhs attacked some of the soldiers who were lagging behind. Ahmad Shah did not react immediately because his army was weighed down by the loot. To protect his camp, he built small fortifications around it every night and continued his journey toward the Attock River, with the Sikhs following him. The Durrani victory at Panipat put an end to the Maratha plans of taking control of Punjab. This left the Durranis and the Sikhs as the two main powers fighting for control over the region. Ahmad Shah then focused on confronting the Sikhs.

The Jats under Suraj Mal benefited significantly from not participating in the Battle of Panipat. They provided considerable assistance to the Maratha soldiers and civilians who escaped the fighting.

Shah Shuja&#x27;s forces (including Persian advisers) played a decisive role in collecting intelligence against the Maratha forces and was notorious in ambushing the leading in hundreds of casualties.

After the Battle of Panipat the services of the Rohillas were rewarded by grants of Shikohabad to Nawab Faiz-ullah Khan and of Jalesar and Firozabad to Nawab Sadullah Khan. Najib Khan proved to be an effective ruler, who restored Delhi to a large extent. However, after his death in 1770, the Rohillas were defeated by the forces of the British East India Company. Najib died on 30 October 1770.

To save their kingdom, the Mughals once again changed sides and welcomed the Afghans to Delhi. The Mughals remained in nominal control over small areas of India but were never a force again. The empire officially ended in 1857 when its last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, was accused of being involved in the Indian Rebellion and exiled.

The result of the battle was the temporary halting of further Maratha advances in the north and destabilisation of their territories for roughly ten years. This period is marked by the rule of Peshwa Madhavrao, who is credited with the revival of Maratha domination following the defeat at Panipat. In 1771, ten years after Panipat, Mahadji Shinde led a large Maratha army into northern India in a counter offensive in which he along with others re-established the fallen Maratha supremacy in the area and punished refractory powers that had either sided with the Afghans, such as the Rohillas, or had shaken off Maratha domination after Panipat. But their success was short-lived. Crippled by Madhavrao&#x27;s untimely death at the age of 28, infighting ensued among Maratha chiefs soon after, and they were ultimately defeated and annexed by the British East India Company administration in 1819.

== Legacy ==

The valour displayed by the Marathas was extolled by Ahmad Shah Abdali in his letter to his ally, Madho Singh, the king of Jaipur.

The battle was referred to in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;With Scindia to Delhi&quot;.

It is, however, also remembered as a scene of valour on both sides. Atai Khan, the adopted son of the Wazir Shah Wali Khan, was said to have been killed during this time when Yeshwantrao Pawar climbed atop his elephant and struck him down. Santaji Wagh&#x27;s corpse was found with over 40 mortal wounds.

<text>A DIMM (Dual In-Line Memory Module) is a popular type of memory module used in computers. It is a printed circuit board with one or both sides (front and back) holding DRAM chips and pins. The vast majority of DIMMs are manufactured in compliance with JEDEC memory standards, although there are proprietary DIMMs. DIMMs come in a variety of speeds and capacities, and are generally one of two lengths: PC, which are , and laptop (SO-DIMM), which are about half the length at .

== History ==
DIMMs (Dual In-line Memory Module) were a 1990s upgrade for SIMMs (Single In-line Memory Modules) as Intel P5-based Pentium processors began to gain market share. The Pentium had a 64-bit bus width, which would require SIMMs installed in matched pairs in order to populate the data bus. The processor would then access the two SIMMs in parallel.

DIMMs were introduced to eliminate this disadvantage. The contacts on SIMMs on both sides are redundant, while DIMMs have separate electrical contacts on each side of the module. This allowed them to double the SIMMs 32-bit data path into a 64-bit data path.

The name &quot;DIMM&quot; was chosen as an acronym for Dual In-line Memory Module symbolizing the split in the contacts of a SIMM into two independent rows. Many enhancements have occurred to the modules in the intervening years, but the word &quot;DIMM&quot; has remained as one of the generic terms for a computer memory module.

== Variants ==

There are numerous DIMM variants, employing different pin-counts:

;DIMM
:* 100-pin: printer SDRAM and printer ROM (e.g., PostScript)
:* 168-pin: SDR SDRAM sometimes used for FPM/EDO DRAM in workstations or servers, may be 3.3 or 5 V
:* 184-pin: DDR SDRAM
:* 200-pin: FPM/EDO DRAM in some Sun workstations and servers
:* 240-pin: DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM and FB-DIMM DRAM
:* 278-pin: HP high density SDRAM
:* 288-pin: DDR4 SDRAM and DDR5 SDRAM
;SO-DIMM
:* 72-pin: FPM DRAM and EDO DRAM; different pin configuration from 72-pin SIMM
:* 144-pin: SDR SDRAM, sometimes used for DDR2 SDRAM
:* 200-pin: DDR SDRAM and DDR2 SDRAM
:* 204-pin: DDR3 SDRAM
:* 260-pin: DDR4 SDRAM
:* 260-pin: UniDIMMs carrying either DDR3 or DDR4 SDRAM; differently notched than DDR4 SO-DIMMs
:* 262-pin: DDR5 SDRAM
;MiniDIMM
:* 244-pin: DDR2 SDRAM

;MicroDIMM
:* 144-pin: SDRAM
:* 172-pin: DDR SDRAM
:* 214-pin: DDR2 SDRAM

== SO-DIMM ==

A SO-DIMM (pronounced &quot;so-dimm&quot; , also spelled &quot;SODIMM&quot;) or small outline DIMM, is a smaller alternative to a DIMM, being roughly half the physical size of a regular DIMM. The first SODIMMs had 72 pins and were introduced by JEDEC in 1997. Before its introduction, many laptops would use proprietary RAM modules which were expensive and hard to find.

SO-DIMMs are often used in computers that have limited space, which include laptops, notebook computers, small-footprint personal computers such as those based on Nano-ITX motherboards, high-end upgradable office printers, and networking hardware such as routers and NAS devices. They are usually available with the same size data path and speed ratings of the regular DIMMs though normally with smaller capacities.

== SDR 168-pin SDRAM ==
On the bottom edge of 168-pin DIMMs there are two notches, and the location of each notch determines a particular feature of the module. The first notch is the DRAM key position, which represents RFU (reserved future use), registered, and unbuffered DIMM types (left, middle and right position, respectively). The second notch is the voltage key position, which represents 5.0 V, 3.3 V, and RFU DIMM types (order is the same as above).

== DDR DIMMs ==
DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and DDR5 all have different pin counts and/or different notch positions, and none of them are forward compatible or backward compatible. DDR5 SDRAM is the most recent type of DDR memory and has been in use since 2020.

== SPD EEPROM ==
A DIMM&#x27;s capacity and other operational parameters may be identified with serial presence detect (SPD), an additional chip which contains information about the module type and timing for the memory controller to be configured correctly. The SPD EEPROM connects to the System Management Bus and may also contain thermal sensors (&quot;TS-on-DIMM&quot;).

== Error correction ==
ECC DIMMs are those that have extra data bits which can be used by the system memory controller to detect and correct errors. There are numerous ECC schemes, but perhaps the most common is Single Error Correct, Double Error Detect (SECDED) which uses an extra byte per 64-bit word. ECC modules usually carry a multiple of 9 instead of a multiple of 8 chips.

== Ranking ==

Sometimes memory modules are designed with two or more independent sets of DRAM chips connected to the same address and data buses; each such set is called a rank. Ranks that share the same slot, only one rank may be accessed at any given time; it is specified by activating the corresponding rank&#x27;s chip select (CS) signal. The other ranks on the module are deactivated for the duration of the operation by having their corresponding CS signals deactivated. DIMMs are currently being commonly manufactured with up to four ranks per module. Consumer DIMM vendors have recently begun to distinguish between single and dual ranked DIMMs.

After a memory word is fetched, the memory is typically inaccessible for an extended period of time while the sense amplifiers are charged for access of the next cell. By interleaving the memory (e.g. cells 0, 4, 8, etc. are stored together in one rank), sequential memory accesses can be performed more rapidly because sense amplifiers have 3 cycles of idle time for recharging, between accesses.

DIMMs are often referred to as &quot;single-sided&quot; or &quot;double-sided&quot; to describe whether the DRAM chips are located on one or both sides of the module&#x27;s printed circuit board (PCB). However, these terms may cause confusion, as the physical layout of the chips does not necessarily relate to how they are logically organized or accessed.

JEDEC decided that the terms &quot;dual-sided&quot;, &quot;double-sided&quot;, or &quot;dual-banked&quot; were not correct when applied to registered DIMMs (RDIMMs).

== Organization ==
Most DIMMs are built using &quot;×4&quot; (&quot;by four&quot;) or &quot;×8&quot; (&quot;by eight&quot;) memory chips with up to nine chips per side; &quot;×4&quot; and &quot;×8&quot; refer to the data width of the DRAM chips in bits. High-capacity DIMMs such as 256 GB DIMMs can have up to 19 chips per side.

In the case of &quot;×4&quot; registered DIMMs, the data width per side is 36 bits; therefore, the memory controller (which requires 72 bits) needs to address both sides at the same time to read or write the data it needs. In this case, the two-sided module is single-ranked. For &quot;×8&quot; registered DIMMs, each side is 72 bits wide, so the memory controller only addresses one side at a time (the two-sided module is dual-ranked).

The above example applies to ECC memory that stores 72 bits instead of the more common 64. There would also be one extra chip per group of eight, which is not counted.

== Speeds ==
For various technologies, there are certain bus and device clock frequencies that are standardized; there is also a decided nomenclature for each of these speeds for each type.

DIMMs based on Single Data Rate (SDR) DRAM have the same bus frequency for data, address and control lines. DIMMs based on Double Data Rate (DDR) DRAM have data but not the strobe at double the rate of the clock; this is achieved by clocking on both the rising and falling edge of the data strobes. Power consumption and voltage gradually became lower with each generation of DDR-based DIMMs.

Another influence is Column Access Strobe (CAS) latency, or CL, which affects memory access speed. This is the delay time between the READ command and the moment data is available. See main article CAS/CL.








== Form factors ==

Several form factors are commonly used in DIMMs. Single Data Rate Synchronous DRAM (SDR SDRAM) DIMMs were primarily manufactured in and heights. When 1U rackmount servers started becoming popular, these form factor registered DIMMs had to plug into angled DIMM sockets to fit in the high box. To alleviate this issue, the next standards of DDR DIMMs were created with a &quot;low profile&quot; (LP) height of around . These fit into vertical DIMM sockets for a 1U platform.

With the advent of blade servers, angled slots have once again become common in order to accommodate LP form factor DIMMs in these space-constrained boxes. This led to the development of the Very Low Profile (VLP) form factor DIMM with a height of around . The DDR3 JEDEC standard for VLP DIMM height is around . These will fit vertically in ATCA systems.

Full-height 240-pin DDR2 and DDR3 DIMMs are all specified at a height of around by standards set by JEDEC. These form factors include 240-pin DIMM, SO-DIMM, Mini-DIMM and Micro-DIMM.

Full-height 288-pin DDR4 DIMMs are slightly taller than their DDR3 counterparts at . Similarly, VLP DDR4 DIMMs are also marginally taller than their DDR3 equivalent at nearly .

As of Q2 2017, Asus has had a PCI-E based &quot;DIMM.2&quot;, which has a similar socket to DDR3 DIMMs and is used to put in a module to connect up to two M.2 NVMe solid-state drives. However, it cannot use common DDR type ram and does not have much support other than Asus.

Regular DIMMs are generally 133.35 mm in length, while SO-DIMMs are generally 67.6 mm in length.

<text>Moniaive ( &#x27;monny-IVE&#x27;; , &quot;The Holy Moor&quot;) is a village in the Parish of Glencairn, in Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. It stands on the Cairn and Dalwhat Waters, north-west of the town of Dumfries. Moniaive has been named best overall small village in the Nithsdale in Bloom competition five times in a row, from 2006 to 2011. The village streetscape was featured in the 2002 Peter Mullan film &quot;The Magdalene Sisters&quot;. In 2004, &quot;The Times&quot; described the village as one of the &#x27;coolest&#x27; in Britain.


== History ==
Moniaive has existed as a village as far back as the 10th century. On 4 July 1636 King Charles I granted a charter in favour of William, Earl of Dumfries, making Moniaive a &#x27;free Burgh of Barony&#x27;. With this charter came the rights to set up a market cross and tolbooth, to hold a weekly market on Tuesday and two annual fairs each of three days duration. Midsummer Fair was from 16 June and Michaelmas Fair on the last day of September.

===Covenanting===
In the 17th century, Moniaive became the refuge for the Covenanters, a group of Presbyterian nonconformists who rebelled at having the Episcopalian religion forced on them by the last three Stuart kings, Charles I, Charles II and James VII. There is a monument off the Ayr Road to James Renwick, a Covenanter leader born in Moniaive, and who aged 26 was the last Covenanter to be executed in Edinburgh.

===James Paterson===

The Scottish artist James Paterson, a founder member of &#x27;The Glasgow Boys&#x27;, settled in Moniaive in 1884 and stayed for 22 years. He painted many local scenes including &quot;The Last Turning&quot; – a view of a woman approaching the village on the lane on the western side of the old millpond (now drained) in the Dalwhat Valley – now displayed in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. A James Paterson museum existed within the village until 2005 displaying photographs and memorabilia from the collection of his granddaughter, Anne Paterson-Wallace.

===Cairn Valley Light Railway===

The Cairn Valley Light Railway was opened from Dumfries in 1905 as a subsidiary company of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Plans initially had involved developing Moniaive into a resort due to the countryside being very scenic and peaceful. Passenger services were suspended as a wartime economy on 3 May 1943 and to all traffic on 4 August 1947.

== Local economy ==
The local economy is dominated by sheep and some cattle farming as well as forestry. The area has a large self-employed community including writers, artists, graphic designers, historical interpretation services, clothing designers, aromatherapists, stained glass workers, a wine importing business, a chocolatier, computer repairs, garden and landscaping services, plant nursery, and child care. There is a large general store including a post office counter, a garage, a cafe, a chocolatier, an Italian restaurant, several artist studios, a primary school, a guest house and two hotels with bars and restaurants, one with accommodation, and two village halls.

A bi-monthly newspaper, called the &quot;Glencairn Gazette&quot;, is produced by volunteers and distributed free to residents.

==Notable people==
* Michael Chaplin, the son of Charlie Chaplin, eloped to and married in Moniaive as a teenager
* Rumer Godden, writer, lived in Moniaive
* Alex Kapranos of rock band Franz Ferdinand bought the house in Moniaive previously owned by James Paterson
* Alan Grant, writer of Judge Dredd and Batman
* John Inglis (missionary)
* Joanna Lumley also has a home near here
* Rab Smith, ex-professional darts player

== Festivals ==
In 2015 Moniaive reinvented itself as Moniaive Festival Village and went on to win a Creative Place Award from Creative Scotland. The village is home to a number of festivals that are held every year including; the Moniaive Folk Festival, the Moniaive Michaelmas Bluegrass Festival, Moniaive Comic Festival, the Scottish Autoharp Weekend, the Moniaive Horse Show, the Moniaive and District Arts Association annual exhibition, the Glencairn and Tynron Horticultural Society show and the Moniaive Gala. In 2016 the Moniaive Comic Book Festival was resurrected as part of the Creative Place award programme, it successfully held its second comic festival in 2017.

== Cairnhead Community Forest and Striding Arches ==

Cairnhead Community Forest is a Scottish charity formed in 1998 to encourage and enable community participation through a working partnership with its owner Forestry and Land Scotland. There are four arches by artist Andy Goldsworthy in the area; the first is built into the byre at Cairnhead while three more can be found on Bail Hill, Benbrack and Colt Hill. Each arch stands just under four metres high, with a span of about seven metres, and consists of 31 blocks of hand-dressed red sandstone weighing approximately 27 tons.

==The GeoDial and John Corrie Wildlife Garden==
In 2009 a GeoDial was commissioned by the Geological Society of Dumfries and Galloway for the people of Moniaive to celebrate the geodiversity of the area. It stands next to the Dalwhat water in the John Corrie Wildlife Garden and riverside walk. The GeoDial has an interpretation board that identifies the rock types of the GeoDial and of the rocks that make up the stone circle that surrounds it.

<text>A mountain railway is a railway that operates in a mountainous region. It may operate through the mountains by following mountain valleys and tunneling beneath mountain passes, or it may climb a mountain to provide transport to and from the summit.

Mountain railways often use narrow gauge tracks to allow for tight curves in the track and reduce tunnel size and structure gauge, and hence construction cost and effort. Where mountain railways need to climb steep gradients, they may use steep grade railway technology, or even operate as funicular railways.

<doc id="142043" wikidata="Q1422244" url="?curid=142043" title="River Fleet">
<text>The River Fleet is the largest of London&#x27;s subterranean rivers, all of which today contain foul water for treatment. It has been used as a culverted sewer since the development of Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s London sewer system in the mid-19th century with the water being treated at Beckton Sewage Treatment Works. Its headwaters are two streams on Hampstead Heath, each of which was dammed into a series of ponds—the Hampstead Ponds and the Highgate Ponds—in the 18th century. At the southern edge of Hampstead Heath these descend underground as sewers and join in Camden Town. The waters flow from the ponds.

The river gives its name to Fleet Street, the eastern end of which is at what was the crossing over the river known as Fleet Bridge, and is now the site of Ludgate Circus.

==Name==
The river&#x27;s name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;tidal inlet&quot;. In Anglo-Saxon times, the Fleet served as a dock for shipping.

The lower reaches of the river were known as the Holbourne (or Oldbourne), from which Holborn derived its name.

The river gives its name to Fleet Street which runs from Ludgate Circus to Temple Bar at the Strand. In the 1970s, a London Underground tube line was planned to lie under the line of Fleet Street, provisionally named the Fleet line. However, it was renamed the Jubilee line in 1977, and plans for the part of the route through the City of London were subsequently abandoned

==Course and tributaries==

The Fleet rises on Hampstead Heath as two sources, which flow on the surface as the Hampstead Ponds and the Highgate Ponds. They then go underground, pass under Kentish Town, join in Camden Town, and flow onwards towards St Pancras Old Church, which was sited on the river&#x27;s banks. From there the river passed in a sinuous course which is responsible for the unusual building line adjacent to King&#x27;s Cross station; the German Gymnasium faced the river banks, and the curve of the Great Northern Hotel follows that of the Fleet, which passes alongside it. King&#x27;s Cross was originally named &quot;Battle Bridge&quot;, a corruption of &quot;Broad Ford Bridge&quot; referring to an older crossing of the Fleet. In turn John Nelson in his &quot;The History, Topography, and Antiquities of the Parish of St. Mary Islington&quot; of 1811 linked a supposed Roman army camp found under some nearby brick fields with the site of Boudica&#x27;s final battle, based only on his comparison of the local topography with the scant description of the battlefield supplied by the near-contemporary historian Tacitus. The name was changed in the 19th century to refer to an unpopular statue of George IV erected in 1830 but, although it was replaced after only fifteen years, the name remains.

From there, it heads down King&#x27;s Cross Road and other streets, including Farringdon Road and Farringdon Street. The line of the former river marks the western boundary of Clerkenwell, the eastern boundary of Holborn and a small part of the eastern boundary of St Pancras. In this way it continues to form part of the boundary of the modern London Boroughs of Camden and Islington.

At Farringdon Street the valley broadens out and straightens to join the Thames beneath Blackfriars Bridge. In the lower reaches, the valley slopes in the surrounding streets which explains the presence of three viaduct bridges (at Holborn Viaduct across Farringdon Street, another over Shoe Lane, and another on Rosebery Avenue where it crosses Warner Street).

A small tributary flowed west to east to join the Fleet near Mount Pleasant. This was later utilised to feed Lamb&#x27;s Conduit. The line of the original brook formed Holborn&#x27;s boundary with St Pancras to the north. The sweeping curve of Roger Street is part of that boundary line.

===Fagswell Brook===
The Fagswell Brook (also spelled &quot;Faggeswell&quot;) was a tributary that joined the Fleet from the east and partially formed the northern boundary of the City of London. The brook flowed east to west on a line &quot;approximating&quot; to Charterhouse Street and Charterhouse Square. In 1603, the historian John Stow described its demise:

A part of the course close to Charterhouse Square was excavated as part of the Crossrail project.

===Today===

The Fleet, which is now a sewer that follows its route, can be seen and heard through a grating in Ray Street, Clerkenwell in front of The Coach pub (formerly the Coach and Horses), just off Farringdon Road. The position of the river can still be seen in the surrounding streetscape with Ray Street and its continuation, Warner Street, lying in a valley where the river once flowed. It can also be heard through a grid in the centre of Charterhouse Street, where it joins Farringdon Road (on the Smithfield side of the junction). In wet weather (when the sewer system is overloaded), and on a very low tide, the murky Fleet can be seen gushing into the Thames from the Thameswalk exit of Blackfriars station, immediately under Blackfriars bridge. (The tunnel exit shown in the picture can be seen much more clearly from directly above.)

The former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, proposed opening short sections of the Fleet and other rivers for ornamental purposes, although the Environment Agency – which manages the project – is pessimistic that the Fleet can be among those uncovered.

==History==
In Roman times, the Fleet was a major river, with its estuary possibly containing the oldest tidal mill in the world. The river secured the western flank of the Roman City.

In Anglo-Saxon times, the Fleet was still a substantial body of water, joining the Thames through a marshy tidal basin over wide at the mouth of the Fleet Valley. Many wells were built along its banks, and some on springs (Bagnigge Wells, Clerkenwell) and St Bride&#x27;s Well, were reputed to have healing qualities; in the 13th century, the river was called River of Wells. The small lane at the south-west end of New Bridge Street is called Watergate because it was the river entrance to Bridewell Palace.

As London grew, the river became increasingly a sewer. The area came to be characterised by poor-quality housing and prisons: Bridewell Palace itself was converted into a prison; Newgate, Fleet and Ludgate prisons were all built in that area. In 1728 Alexander Pope wrote in his &quot;Dunciad&quot;, &quot;To where Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams / Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames / The king of dykes! than whom no sluice of mud / with deeper sable blots the silver flood&quot;.
Following the Great Fire of London in 1666, architect Christopher Wren&#x27;s proposal for widening the river was rejected. Rather, the Fleet was converted into the New Canal, completed in 1680 under the supervision of Robert Hooke. Newcastle Close and Old Seacoal Lane (now just short alleyways off Farringdon Street) recall the wharves that used to line this canal, especially used by the coastal coal trade from the north-east of England. (An adjacent narrow road, Seacoal Lane, also existed until the late 20th century, when the present building fronting onto Farringdon Street was built, perhaps suggesting that a new wharf had been built near the old one.)

The upper canal, unpopular and unused, was from 1737 enclosed between Holborn and Ludgate Circus to form the &quot;Fleet Market&quot;. The lower part, the section from Ludgate Circus to the Thames, had been covered by 1769 for the opening of the new Blackfriars Bridge and was consequently named &quot;New Bridge Street&quot;.

The development of the Regent&#x27;s Canal and urban growth covered the river in King&#x27;s Cross and Camden from 1812. The Fleet Market was closed during the 1860s with the construction of Farringdon Road and Farringdon Street as a highway to the north and the Metropolitan Railway, while the final upper section of the river was covered when Hampstead was expanded in the 1870s.

The history of the River Fleet was documented by the 19th-century artist and historian Anthony Crosby. His sketches and notes are held in the Crosby Collection at The London Archives. The archive has been used extensively by researchers, historians and publishers to provide images and contemporary descriptions of the 19th-century Fleet during the period when it was undergoing significant change.

<text>The Hamptons, part of the East End of Long Island, consist of the towns of Southampton and East Hampton, which together compose the South Fork of Long Island, in Suffolk County, New York. The Hamptons are a popular seaside resort and one of the historical summer colonies of the northeastern United States.

The Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the Montauk Highway, and private bus services connect the Hamptons to the rest of Long Island and to New York City, while ferries provide connections to Shelter Island, New York and Connecticut.

Stony Brook University&#x27;s Southampton campus is located in the Hamptons.

==Hamlets and villages==
West to east, the Hamptons include the following hamlets and villages in the town of Southampton:
* Eastport (hamlet)
* Speonk (hamlet)
* Remsenburg (hamlet)
* Westhampton (hamlet)
* West Hampton Dunes (village)
* Westhampton Beach (village)
* Quogue (village)
* East Quogue (hamlet)
* Hampton Bays (hamlet)
**Places of Interest: Shinnecock Bay
* Shinnecock Hills (hamlet)
* North Sea
* Southampton (village)
* Water Mill (hamlet)
* Bridgehampton (hamlet)
* Sagaponack (village)
* Sag Harbor (village, shared with East Hampton)

The Hamptons include the following hamlets and villages in the town of East Hampton:
*Sag Harbor (village, shared with Southampton)
* Wainscott
* East Hampton (village)
* Northwest Harbor
* Springs
* Amagansett
* Montauk

The Shinnecock Reservation of the Shinnecock Indian Nation lies within the borders of the Town of Southampton, adjoining Shinnecock Hills and the Village of Southampton.

These areas constitute the core vacation area of the east end of Long Island.

==Description==
The Hamptons are home to many communities. Historically, it has been devoted to agriculture and fishing. Many farms are still in operation in the area. There are three commercial vineyards operating in the Hamptons as well.

Given the area&#x27;s geographic location, it maintained strong commercial and social links to New England and the nearby states of Connecticut and Rhode Island. Many of the original settlers were from and most of the trade links were with communities in Connecticut. Indeed, much of the older architecture and aesthetics of the villages in the Hamptons resemble New England. This is especially true for Sag Harbor Village and East Hampton Village.

Once direct rail links to New York City were established, the community of summer vacation residents expanded significantly. The Village of Southampton, which is the oldest of the Hamptons and the most westward of the villages in the core area of the Hamptons, grew rapidly. It remains the largest and most diverse of the Hamptons&#x27; towns. The other villages and hamlets grew at a slower rate over time.

The agriculture community became supplemented by artisans and professionals (mainly in Southampton Village and Sag Harbor Village), and then by a large influx of artists. As a result, the arts community in the Hamptons has origins extending back to the nineteenth century. The Art Village in Southampton and the community of Springs in East Hampton town hosted a number of resident artists and art schools (e.g., the Shinnecock Hills Summer School founded by William Merritt Chase).

===Current profile===

The villages and the hamlets are distinguished by how their significant population increases during the summers, although the Hamptons have increasingly become year-round destinations for New Yorkers seeking a refuge on weekends.

Amenities in the area include the Southampton Arts Center, the Southampton Cultural Center, the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center in Springs; the Parrish Art Museum and the Watermill Center in Water Mill; the Guild Hall, a museum and theater, in East Hampton. In the sporting world, the region&#x27;s golf courses are very highly regarded. The private golf clubs in Southampton are among the most exclusive and expensive in the nation. Those courses include the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, National Golf Links of America, and the Sebonack Golf Club. In 2023, these golf clubs were ranked 4th, 7th, and 43rd within the United States by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;. There is also the Maidstone Club in East Hampton, ranked 52nd by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; that same year.

Other private clubs include The Bathing Corporation of Southampton, the Southampton Bath and Tennis Club, and the Meadow Club in Southampton Village.

==History==
The Hamptons&#x27; history as a dwelling place for the wealthy dates from the late nineteenth century when the community changed from a farming community with good potato ground to a popular destination. In 1893 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote

, commercial and point residential development continues and the Hamptons remain a vacation spot for the wealthy. The Hamptons have also become a notable place for prominent members of the LGBT community. Beaches in the Southeastern United States have been referred to as &quot;The Hamptons of the South&quot;, including Figure Eight Island in North Carolina, Hilton Head Island and Kiawah Island in South Carolina, and South Walton in Florida.

==Media==
Dan&#x27;s Papers, which originally began as the &quot;Montauk Pioneer&quot; on July 1, 1960, is published by Schneps Media.

==Transportation==

The Hamptons are connected to New York City and the rest of Long Island by a series of roadways (most notable of which are Route 27A, also known as Montauk Highway, and Route 27, also known as Sunrise Highway), rail service, and bus service. There are also several small airports throughout the Hamptons which offer both private and commercial service on small aircraft and helicopters.

The Long Island Rail Road provides limited rail service seven days per week via the Montauk Branch connecting towns and hamlets in the Hamptons to Montauk and New York City. Hampton Jitney and Hampton Luxury Liner coach bus services provide slightly more frequent passenger travel between New York City and the Hamptons, especially during summer months. Local Suffolk County buses also provide service to neighboring areas.

The term was coined by San Francisco Bay Area journalist Tim Kawakami in the 2016 NBA offseason after the Warriors signed Durant out of free agency. This played off the fact that the other four named players, all part of the original &quot;Death Lineup&quot;, traveled with team officials to The Hamptons to meet with and recruit Durant.
* F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s The Great Gatsby was inspired by the extravagant parties he attended in the Hamptons and along Long Island&#x27;s Gold Coast in the 1920s. These gatherings, hosted by the wealthy elite, influenced the novel&#x27;s depiction of the lavish lifestyles of Long Island millionaires during the Jazz Age.

<text>The Cairngorm Mountain Railway, which opened in 2001, is the highest railway in the United Kingdom. The two-kilometre long funicular ascends the northern slopes of Cairn Gorm, the United Kingdom&#x27;s sixth-highest mountain, serving the Cairngorm Mountain ski resort. The route and ski area are located within the Cairngorms National Park, the largest National Nature Reserve in Britain, located near Aviemore in the Highland area of Scotland.
It is a Doppelmayr 120-SSB funicular railway.

It is owned by the Highlands and Islands Enterprise and was operated by Cairngorm Mountain Limited until July 2014, when Natural Retreats UK took over the lease. Since 2018, it has been run by Cairngorm Mountain (Scotland) Limited.

The railway closed in October 2018 due to structural issues; it reopened in January 2023, then shut down again in August 2023; 0n 04 December 2024, Highlands and Islands Enterprise said they expected it to open at the end of December.

==History==
=== Construction ===
Construction of the Cairngorm Mountain Railway started in 1999 and it opened on 24 December 2001 (forty years after the opening of the White Lady Chairlift, which it replaced). The construction was initiated because the chairlift was too sensitive to the strong winds in the area. The track is a broad gauge of . The maximum operating speed is during the ski season and the rest of the year. At these speeds, the trip takes about four minutes in winter and nine minutes during the summer (calculated without middle station stops). The single track line has a passing loop just above the middle station. During ascent, the maximum gradient is 23° (1 in 2.5, or 40-per cent inclination). The railway starts at the Base Station in the Coire Cas area, where there is a restaurant, shop, ticket office, hire shop, rangers&#x27; office and Disability Sport UK office. The Scottish Ski Club has a building close to the middle station.

At peak times there can be 150,000–160,000 non-winter sports visitors, combined with a further 50,000–120,000 annual sports visitors during the winter. CML can expect to cater to 1,000 visitors per day in the summer months.

The railway is from Aviemore and can be reached travelling along the B970 and C38 roads to Glenmore. From Glenmore, a route is taken through the snow gates and via a one-way system past Coire na Ciste for approximately . The Base Station is at an altitude of approximately above sea level, the middle station is at approximately and the top Ptarmigan Station is at approximately .

The total length of the funicular railway track is , during which the route rises by . Most of the route is single track, with a short passing loop near half way. Up to 120 standing passengers can be carried in each of the system&#x27;s two carriages. The train is fully accessible for wheelchair users and both the Base Station and Ptarmigan Station have lift access to all levels.

Depending on wind direction, wind speed trend and weather forecast, the trains can operate in winds of . As the train approaches the top station it enters a long cut-and-cover tunnel taking it up to the top platform hidden in the hillside.

The funicular railway operates by &#x27;hauling&#x27; up one carriage using electric motors to pull the haul rope as the other carriage descends at the same time. The system is powered by two stationary in series 500 kW electric motors, a gear box and a &#x27;soft start-soft stop&#x27; control system which can increase the electrical frequency and vary the current and voltage to control the carriage speeds as they approach or leave a station. A hydraulically operated &#x27;counter&#x27; rope is connected to both carriages to maintain haul rope tension. The two carriages are permanently connected by the haul rope and the counter rope and can never operate independently.

The funicular railway system is normally operated from a staffed control room within the Ptarmigan building, but can also be operated from the Base station control room or from each railway carriage. There are dedicated sophisticated computer control, instrumentation, communication and safety systems for the railway which have a range of back up systems and there are also standby generators and manual back up systems for moving the carriages.

During the ski season, skiers are asked to stay within the designated ski area and climbers and hill walkers are not allowed to use the railway to travel uphill. The railway operators have agreed, in conjunction with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), to operate a formal visitor management plan to protect fragile areas of the mountain environment. This means that for conservation reasons, the public is not allowed to access the mountains during the summer season from Ptarmigan building. However, walkers who have climbed the hill themselves may purchase a downhill ticket at the Ptarmigan building for travelling back down to Base. There are no middle station stops or exits during the summer.

On 29 November 2018, it was announced that the railway had been placed into administration. Blair Milne, one of the administrators, cited that the company had become &quot;unsustainably loss-making&quot; after an extended closure in October 2018. Natural Retreats, the previous owners since 2013, released a press statement saying the firm still had &quot;potential&quot;. That hope did not come to fruition and the company owed £2m.

=== Closure ===
The closure of the Cairngorm Mountain Railway funicular was due to &quot;health and safety concerns&quot; and &quot;structural problems&quot; according to reports in summer 2019. At the time, an engineering investigation was still underway to determine whether modifications would be &quot;achievable and affordable&quot;, according to its then-owner, the Scottish government&#x27;s Highlands and Islands Enterprise which also owns Cairngorm Mountain ski centre. The final findings of the consultants, SE Group, were released in July 2019, but a decision on how to proceed had not yet been made at that time.

=== Reinstatement and closure===
On 14 October 2020, the Scottish Government announced more than £16m would be spent on the reinstatement of the funicular railway as part of a £20m project. The programme of engineering works commenced in early November 2020. The works were completed late in 2022 and the railway resumed on 26 January 2023. It was closed again on 25 August 2023, when scarf joints installed during the remedial works were found to be out of tolerance.

<text>Nord-Ost (, means &quot;North-East&quot; in German) is a Russian musical theatre production that was composed by Aleksei Ivaschenko and Georgii Vasilyev, based on the novel &quot;The Two Captains&quot; by Veniamin Kaverin. It is a fictional story based around the historical events surrounding the discovery of the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago in 1913. The musical was first staged on October 19, 2001 in the Dubrovka theatre, where it played over 400 performances.

The play celebrates the Russian soldiers who fought in World War II.

== Development ==
In the 1990s Georgy Vasiliyev saw &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in New York City, and felt inspired to take theatre to Russia. He tried to buy the rights to &quot;Les Misérables&quot; but did not succeed, so he decided to start a homegrown Russian production. He spent funds to convert a former ball-bearing factory &quot;culture hall&quot; into a modern theatre. He spent , making the play the most expensive theatre project in the history of Russia. The tickets were US$15 each, making them relatively expensive. Vasiliyev showed his financiers a marketing study stating that 30% of Moscow&#x27;s population fit the profile audience that would be willing to pay for the production, due to changing sensibilities and increasing incomes. The Russian theatre community had a prejudice against this kind of play. Peter Baker and Susan Glasser said that the Russian theatre community &quot;considered the concept the thespian version of McDonald&#x27;s&quot;.

Vasiliyev said &quot;&quot;Nord-Ost&quot; was a sort of protest against tarnishing our history, against not believing in your own strength, against all this pervasive, depressing, ugly stuff in mass media. &quot;Nord-Ost&quot; is the opposite. It&#x27;s a romantic story about family. It&#x27;s a story that elevates us and our history. It&#x27;s a story that enables us to look at our history not as the history of class struggle, wars, and repressions, but a history of people and personal achievements&quot;.

== Terrorist attack ==

On October 23, 2002 Chechen terrorists took the audience hostage in the Moscow theater that was showing the production of &quot;Nord-Ost&quot;, threatening to blow up the building and demanding withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya. Most of the hostages were released after the theatre was stormed by special forces. 130 hostages died from poison gas used by Russian special forces; &quot;Nord-Ost&quot; lost 17 members of the team, including 2 child actors aged 13 (Kristina Kurbatova and Arsenii Kurilenko) and one third of all musicians in the orchestra. The producer Georgii Vasilyev had been among the hostages.

After the attack, &quot;Nord-Ost&quot; returned to the same theater stage in Moscow on February 8, 2003 and continued showing there until May 10, 2003, when the producers took it off the stage, blaming a lack of audience interest on fears caused by the attack.

<text>Minority Report is a 2002 American cyberpunk action film directed by Steven Spielberg, loosely based on Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1956 novella &quot;The Minority Report&quot;. The film takes place in the Washington metropolitan area in 2054, in which a specialized police department—Precrime—apprehends criminals by use of provided by three psychics called &quot;precogs&quot;. The cast stars Tom Cruise as Precrime chief John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as precog Agatha Lively, and Max von Sydow as Precrime director Lamar Burgess. The film combines elements of tech noir, whodunit, thriller, and science fiction genres, as well as being a traditional chase film, since the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive. Spielberg characterized the story as &quot;fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot&quot;.

The film was first optioned in 1992 as a sequel to another Dick adaptation, &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), with Arnold Schwarzenegger set to reprise his leading role. When the production company, Carolco Pictures, filed for bankruptcy, the project was reworked into a standalone project. Its development started in 1997 after Jon Cohen&#x27;s script reached Spielberg and Cruise. Production suffered many delays due to Cruise&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I.&quot; running over schedule, eventually starting in March 2001. During pre-production, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists in an attempt to present a more plausible future world than that seen in other science fiction films. Some of the film&#x27;s portrayed technology has proven prescient.

Cruise and Spielberg&#x27;s high-profile collaboration made &quot;Minority Report&quot; one of 2002&#x27;s most anticipated films. It received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success as 2002&#x27;s tenth most-successful film worldwide, grossing over $358 million against a production budget of $102 million. It was nominated for several awards including an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing. Of eleven Saturn Award nominations, the film won Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing, and Best Supporting Actress. It has since been included in lists of the greatest science fiction films of all time. A &quot;Minority Report&quot; tie-in video game and single-season television series followed its release.

== Plot ==

In 2054, the federal government plans to nationally implement the Washington, D.C., prototype &quot;Precrime&quot; police program, which has been operating for six years. Three clairvoyant humans (&quot;precogs&quot;) receive psychic impressions of an impending homicide, and officers analyze their visions to determine the location and apprehend the perpetrator before the crime can occur. Would-be killers are placed in an electrically induced coma and held in a panopticon-like prison facility. Although Precrime has eliminated nearly all premeditated murders during its six-year existence, spontaneous crimes of passion called &quot;red ball&quot; killings still occur, giving the police only a short time to act.

Precrime chief John Anderton joined the program after his six-year-old son Sean was abducted and never found. He suffers from depression and addiction to a drug called neuroin, and his wife Lara has left him. Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer audits the Precrime operation, intent on uncovering any flaws. Agatha, one of the precogs, experiences a flashback to a woman&#x27;s drowning as Anderton watches. Curious, he learns from the prison warden that the intended victim, Anne Lively, went missing shortly after her murder was prevented; however, he also discovers that Agatha&#x27;s vision of the crime is not on file. Soon afterward, the precogs predict that Anderton will kill a man named Leo Crow, whom he has never met. Anderton flees, prompting Witwer to begin a manhunt.

Anderton visits Dr. Iris Hineman, a geneticist whose research led to the creation of Precrime, and learns that the precogs&#x27; abilities are from birth, the result of brain damage caused by their parents&#x27; addiction to early, impure forms of neuroin during pregnancy. Hineman explains that one precog occasionally sees a different future vision from the others, known as a &quot;minority report&quot;. These discrepancies are purged from the official record to maintain the precogs&#x27; reputation of infallibility, but the precogs retain their memories. If Anderton does have a minority report, Hineman says, it will most likely have been generated by Agatha since she is the strongest of the three.

After undergoing eye transplant surgery to evade the retinal scanners installed all over the city, Anderton returns to Precrime. Using his removed old eyes, which he kept after the transplant surgery, he enters the Temple where the precogs are kept and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the group-mind on which Precrime depends. With the assistance of a cybercriminal, Anderton searches Agatha&#x27;s memories but fails to find a minority report for Crow&#x27;s murder. However, he finds and downloads her memories of Anne&#x27;s death. The two track Crow to a hotel room and find photos of many children, including his son Sean. Anderton accuses Crow of killing Sean and nearly kills him but relents at the last moment to place him under arrest. Crow then claims he was hired to plant the photos and begs Anderton to kill him, saying that his family will only be paid if he dies. When Anderton still refuses, Crow kills himself in a manner similar to the precogs&#x27; vision of Anderton killing him.

Tipped off by Anderton, Witwer investigates Anne&#x27;s case and finds discrepancies to suggest that she had indeed been murdered. He reports his findings to Lamar Burgess, director of Precrime, who kills him with Anderton&#x27;s gun, safe in the knowledge that the offline precogs cannot reveal him to be Witwer&#x27;s murderer. Anderton takes Agatha to Lara&#x27;s house, where they are finally tracked down by a tactical team of Precrime officers. Anderton is arrested and imprisoned for the murders of Crow and Witwer, and Agatha is returned to the other precogs. After Anderton&#x27;s imprisonment, Lara discusses Anderton&#x27;s concerns about Anne Lively with Burgess. Burgess initially denies any recollection of Anne Lively but later in the same conversation says he will look into her drowning—a detail Lara never mentioned. She becomes suspicious and breaks Anderton out of prison, allowing him to confront Burgess at a banquet celebrating the national launch of Precrime.

At the banquet, Anderton puts a call through to Burgess, confronting the director with the crime recurring in Agatha&#x27;s memory that Burgess is trying to conceal. Anne, a neuroin addict and Agatha&#x27;s mother, had given up custody of Agatha; some time later, she broke her habit and tried to reclaim her daughter. Desperate to preserve Precrime, Burgess hired a man to kill Anne, knowing that Precrime would intervene, then killed her himself in the predicted manner afterward. As a cover-up, the Precrime technicians, trained to disregard the second murder vision as an echo of the first one, deleted the record. Once Anderton began to investigate, Burgess arranged for Crow to pose as Sean&#x27;s abductor in order to provoke Anderton to murder.

A &quot;red ball&quot; report comes in, indicating that Burgess will kill Anderton. As the two men face each other down, Anderton points out the dilemma facing Burgess: he can spare Anderton and watch Precrime be discredited and shut down, or validate the program by killing him and going to prison. Burgess asks Anderton&#x27;s forgiveness before killing himself.

Anderton and Lara reconcile, with Lara becoming pregnant with another child. Precrime is abandoned and the prisoners are pardoned and released, though many remain under police surveillance. The precogs are moved to an undisclosed location to live in peace.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Philip K. Dick&#x27;s story was first optioned by producer and writer Gary Goldman in 1992. He created the initial script for the film with Ron Shusett and Robert Goethals (uncredited). It was supposed to be a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation &quot;Total Recall&quot;, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, Carolco Pictures, the production company that produced the film, struggled to secure either funding or Schwarzenegger&#x27;s interest to progress the project before its bankruptcy in 1995. While the remake rights were purchased by Miramax Films in 1997, Shusett and Goldman had removed the &quot;Total Recall&quot; elements from their script to develop it as a standalone film, &quot;Minority Report&quot;.

Novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version that would have been directed by Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg, who met and became friends on the set of Cruise&#x27;s film &quot;Risky Business&quot; in 1983, had been looking to collaborate for ten years. Spielberg was set to direct Cruise in &quot;Rain Man&quot;, but left to make &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. Cruise read Cohen&#x27;s script, and passed it onto Spielberg, who felt it needed some work. Spielberg was not directly involved in the writing of the script, though he was allowed to decide whether the picture&#x27;s screenplay was ready to be filmed. When Cohen submitted an acceptable revision, he called Cruise and said, &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;ll do &quot;this&quot; version of the script.&quot; In that version, Witwer creates a false disk which shows Anderton killing him. When Anderton sees the clip, his belief in the infallibility of the precogs&#x27; visions convinces him it is true, therefore the precogs have a vision of him killing Witwer. At the end, Anderton shoots Witwer and one of the brother precogs finishes him off, because Witwer had slain his twin. Spielberg was attracted to the story because as both a mystery and a film set 50 years in the future, it allowed him to do &quot;a blending of genres&quot; which intrigued him.

In 1998, the pair joined &quot;Minority Report&quot; and announced the production as a joint venture of Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Cruise&#x27;s Cruise/Wagner Productions, and De Bont&#x27;s production company, Blue Tulip, the latter of which had previously worked on &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;. In exchange for directing &quot;The Haunting&quot;, Spielberg offered to take over directing duties on &quot;Minority Report&quot; while De Bont was busy with post-production for &quot;Twister&quot;. Spielberg however stated that despite being credited, De Bont never became involved with the film. Cruise and Spielberg, at Spielberg&#x27;s insistence, reportedly agreed to each take 15% of the gross instead of any money up front to try to keep the film&#x27;s budget under $100 million. Spielberg said he had done the same with name actors in the past to great success: &quot;Tom Hanks took no cash for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; but he made a lot of money on his profit participation.&quot; He made this agreement a prerequisite:

Production was delayed for several years. The original plan was to begin filming after Cruise&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was finished, but that film ran over schedule, which also allowed Spielberg time to bring in screenwriter Scott Frank to rework Cohen&#x27;s screenplay. John August did an uncredited draft to polish the script, and Frank Darabont was also invited to rewrite, but was by then busy with &quot;The Majestic&quot;. The film closely follows Scott Frank&#x27;s final script (completed May 16, 2001), and contains much of Cohen&#x27;s third draft (May 24, 1997). Frank removed the character of Senator Malcolm from Cohen&#x27;s screenplay, and inserted Burgess, who became the &quot;bad guy&quot;. He also rewrote Witwer from a villain to a &quot;good guy&quot;, as he was in the short story. In contrast to Spielberg&#x27;s next science fiction picture, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, which he called &quot;100 percent character&quot; driven, Spielberg said the story for &quot;Minority Report&quot; became &quot;50 percent character and 50 percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot.&quot; According to film scholar Warren Buckland, Cohen and Frank apparently did not see the Goldman and Schusett screenplay, but instead worked on their own adaptation. Goldman and Schusett, however, claimed the pair used a lot of material from their script, so the issue went through the Writer&#x27;s Guild arbitration process. They won a partial victory; they were not given writing credits, but were listed as executive producers. The film was delayed again so Spielberg could finish &quot;A.I.&quot; after the death of his friend Stanley Kubrick. When Spielberg originally signed on to direct, he planned to have an entirely different supporting cast. He offered the role of Witwer to Matt Damon, Iris Hineman to Meryl Streep, Burgess to Ian McKellen, Agatha to Cate Blanchett, and Lara to Jenna Elfman. Streep declined the role, Damon opted out due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, and the other roles were recast due to the delays. Spielberg also offered the role of Witwer to Javier Bardem, who turned it down.

=== Technology ===

After &quot;E.T.&quot;, Spielberg started to consult experts, and put more scientific research into his science fiction films. In 1999, he invited fifteen experts convened by Peter Schwartz and Stewart Brand to a hotel in Santa Monica for a three-day &quot;think tank&quot;. He wanted to consult with the group to create a plausible &quot;future reality&quot; for the year 2054 as opposed to a more traditional &quot;science fiction&quot; setting. Dubbed the &quot;think tank summit&quot;, the experts included architect Peter Calthorpe, author Douglas Coupland, urbanist and journalist Joel Garreau, computer scientist Neil Gershenfeld, biomedical researcher Shaun Jones, computer scientist Jaron Lanier, and former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) architecture dean William J. Mitchell. Production designer Alex McDowell kept what was nicknamed the &quot;2054 bible&quot;, an 80-page guide created in preproduction which listed all the aspects of the future world: architectural, socio-economic, political, and technological. While the discussions did not change key elements in the film, they were influential in the creation of some of the more utopian aspects, though John Underkoffler, the science and technology advisor for the film, described it as &quot;much grayer and more ambiguous&quot; than what was envisioned in 1999. Underkoffler, who designed most of Anderton&#x27;s interface after Spielberg told him to make it &quot;like conducting an orchestra&quot;, said &quot;it would be hard to identify anything [in the movie] that had no grounding in reality.&quot; McDowell teamed up with architect Greg Lynn to work on some of the technical aspects of the production design. Lynn praised his work, saying that a &quot;lot of those things Alex cooked up for &quot;Minority Report&quot;, like the 3-D screens, have become real.&quot;

Spielberg described his ideas for the film&#x27;s technology to Roger Ebert before its release:

=== Filming ===

&quot;Minority Report&quot; was the first film to have an entirely digital production design. Termed &quot;previz&quot;, as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film&#x27;s narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3D animation programs (Maya and XSI) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previous system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said &quot;It became pretty clear that [he] wouldn&#x27;t read an illustration as a finished piece, but if you did it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it.&quot;

Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Los Angeles. Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building (as PreCrime headquarters) and Georgetown. The skyline of Rosslyn, Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River. A quick shot of Indian Field Creek, which crosses the Colonial Parkway in Yorktown, Virginia, is seen as John takes Agatha to his wife&#x27;s house. During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone and with Tom Cruise; together they conferred publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam on the set of &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; in New York.

The location of the small, uncharted island in the last shot of the film is Butter Island off North Haven, Maine in the Penobscot Bay.

Although it takes place in an imagined future world of advanced technology, &quot;Minority Report&quot; attempts to embody a more &quot;realistic&quot; depiction of the future. Spielberg decided that to be more credible, the setting had to keep both elements of the present and ones which specialists expected would be forthcoming. Thus Washington, D.C., as depicted in the movie keeps well-known buildings such as the Capitol and the Washington Monument, as well as a section of modern buildings on the other side of the Potomac River. Production designer Alex McDowell was hired based on his work in &quot;Fight Club&quot; and his storyboards for a film version of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; which would have starred Mel Gibson. McDowell studied modern architecture, and his sets contain many curves, circular shapes, and reflective materials. Costume designer Deborah L. Scott decided to make the clothes worn by the characters as simple as possible, so as not to make the depiction of the future seem dated.

The stunt crew was the same one used in Cruise&#x27;s &quot;Mission: Impossible 2&quot;, and was responsible for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) did most of the visual effects, while PDI/DreamWorks was responsible for the Spyder robots, making it their final live-action visual effects job before solely working with DreamWorks Animation shortly afterwards. PDI visual effects supervisor Henry LaBounta took inspiration from deep sea jellyfish while creating the Spyder robots: &quot;Their tentacles have these bioluminescent little lights that kind of run through their tentacles and that just looks so cool. So I got back to the studio and talked to the artists and I said, ‘We’re gonna do some radiating jellyfish bioluminescent lights on the bottom of this spider, and try that.’&quot; Pixel Liberation Front handled previsualization animatics. The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.

=== Storyline differences ===
Like most film adaptations of Dick&#x27;s works, many aspects of his story were changed in their transition to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film&#x27;s action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton&#x27;s, and that of the three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased.

Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts.

Anderton&#x27;s future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog&#x27;s mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film&#x27;s ending also differs from the short story&#x27;s. In Dick&#x27;s story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings about the end of the organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs&#x27; visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.

=== Themes ===
The main theme of &quot;Minority Report&quot; is the classic philosophical debate of free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, and the nature of self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg&#x27;s tradition of depicting broken families, which he has said is motivated by his parents&#x27; divorce when he was a child.

== Music ==

The score was composed and conducted by regular Spielberg collaborator John Williams, who was inspired by Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s film music; instead of focusing on the science fiction elements, he made a score suitable for the film noir, including the use of female singer in the some sequences, and emotional themes, which Williams considered unusual for that genre. Several classical pieces, including Franz Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 (&quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot;), Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet (Op. 64, No. 1), Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 (&quot;Pathétique&quot;), were implemented in the score, though Williams said that the choices of using classical pieces were made by the studio.

Besides composing, Williams conducted the score, with orchestration by John Neufeld and vocals by Deborah Dietrich. The music was released on June 18, 2002 by DreamWorks Records in CD, vinyl and cassettes, and re-issued by Geffen Records in mid-2014 for streaming media and download. The full score as heard in the film, was released into a 2-disc &quot;expanded edition&quot; in 2019, which was marketed by La-La Land Records, along with several alternate and unused tracks as bonus material.

== Style ==

&quot;Minority Report&quot; is a futuristic film which portrays elements of a both dystopian and utopian future. The film renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book and contains new technologies not in Dick&#x27;s story. From a stylistic standpoint, &quot;Minority Report&quot; resembles Spielberg&#x27;s previous film &quot;A.I.&quot;, but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he &quot;wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. &quot;Asphalt Jungle&quot;. &quot;Key Largo&quot;. &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;.&quot; The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son&#x27;s kidnapping at the pool is the only one shot in &quot;normal&quot; color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film&#x27;s colors, to the point that it nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by &quot;about 40%&quot; to achieve the &quot;washed-out&quot; appearance. Elvis Mitchell, formerly of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented that &quot;The picture looks as if it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late &#x27;70s car.&quot;

Spielberg preferred film to the then-emerging digital video format, and opted to create the film&#x27;s look photochemically. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński shot with high-speed film in Super 35 format (which requires an additional enlarging process) to increase the overall grain, having been told by Spielberg to create &quot;the ugliest, dirtiest movie&quot; he&#x27;d ever shot. The film&#x27;s camera work is very mobile, alternating between handheld and Steadicam shots, which are &quot;exaggerated by the use of wide angle lenses and the occasional low camera angle&quot; to increase the perception of movement according to film scholar Warren Buckland.

Kamiński said that he never used a lens longer than 27mm, and alternated between 17, 21, and 27mm lenses, as Spielberg liked to &quot;keep the actors as close to the camera as possible&quot;. He also said, &quot;We staged a lot of scenes in wide shots that have a lot of things happening with the frame.&quot; The duo also used several long takes to focus on the emotions of the actors, rather than employing numerous cuts.

Spielberg eschewed the typical &quot;shot reverse shot&quot; cinematography technique used when filming characters&#x27; interactions in favor of the long takes, which were shot by a mobile, probing camera. McDowell relied on colorless chrome and glass objects of curved and circular shapes in his set designs, which, aided by the &quot;low-key contrastive lighting&quot;, populated the film with shadows, creating a &quot;futuristic film noir atmosphere&quot;.

===Opening sequence===
Buckland describes the film&#x27;s 14 minute opening sequence as the &quot;most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film.&quot; The first scene is a distorted precog vision of a murder, presented out of context. The pace of the film is sped up, slowed, and even reversed, and the movie &quot;jumps about in time and space&quot; by intercutting the images in no discernible order. When it ends, it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha&#x27;s eyes, and that this is how previsions appear to her. Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a &quot;trailer&quot;, because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of &quot;tone, generic expectations, and enigmas&quot; that will be used in the film.

The visions of the pre-cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a &quot;squishy lens&quot; device, which distorts the images, blurring their edges and creating ripples across them. They were created by a two-man production team, hired by Spielberg, who chose the &quot;layered, dreamlike imagery&quot; based on some comments from cognitive psychologists the pair consulted. In the opening&#x27;s next scene, Anderton is &quot;scrubbing the images&quot;, by standing like a composer (as Spielberg terms it), and manipulating them, while Jad assists him. Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha&#x27;s vision is shown interacting, which establishes that the opening scene was a prevision. The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs&#x27; images, before alternating between the three.

The opening is self-contained, and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story. It lasts 14 minutes, includes 171 shots, and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6.5 second average for the entire film. The opening&#x27;s five-second average is attained despite &quot;very fast cutting&quot; in the beginning and ending, because the middle has longer takes, which reach 20 seconds in some instances. Spielberg also continues his tradition of &quot;heavily diffused backlighting&quot; for much of the interior shots.

== Release ==

=== Context ===
The summer of 2002 was expected to be competitive at the global box office due to the high number of franchises, blockbusters, and star-studded projects.

Spielberg typically keeps the plot points of his films closely guarded before their release, and &quot;Minority Report&quot; was no different. He said he had to remove some scenes, and a few &quot;F-words&quot; to get the film&#x27;s PG-13 rating. Following the disappointing box office results of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I.&quot;, the marketing campaign for &quot;Minority Report&quot; downplayed his role in the movie and sold the film as a Cruise action thriller.

Tom Rothman, chairman of the film&#x27;s co-financier Fox Filmed Entertainment, described the film&#x27;s marketing strategy thus: &quot;How are we marketing it? It&#x27;s Cruise and Spielberg. What else do we need to do?&quot; The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise&#x27;s resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues. With their combined 30% take of the film&#x27;s box office though, sources such as &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;&#x27;s Ron Grover predicted the studios would have a hard time making the money needed to break even. Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the film than they would a more family friendly film.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; projected the film would gross $40 million in the US in its opening weekend, and &quot;Variety&quot; predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a &quot;commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run.&quot;

=== Theatrical run ===
The world premiere of &quot;Minority Report&quot; took place in New York City on June 19, 2002. An online &quot;popcorn cam&quot; broadcast live from inside the premiere. Cruise attended the London premiere the following week, and mingled with thousands of adoring fans as he walked through the city&#x27;s Leicester Square. It debuted at first place in the U.S. box office, collecting $35.677 million in its opening weekend, narrowly above &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; considered those numbers below expectations, as they gave the film a small edge over &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, which debuted in second place ($35.260 million). &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; sold more tickets, but since much of the film&#x27;s attendees were children, its average ticket price was much lower.

The film opened at the top of the box office in numerous foreign markets; it made $6.7 million in 780 locations in Germany its opening weekend, and accounted for 35% of France&#x27;s total box office weekend office gross when it collected $5 million in 700 theaters. In Great Britain, &quot;Minority Report&quot; made $36.9 million in its first three days. It went on to make $5.9 million in the UK, ranking number one at the box office, beating &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. &quot;Minority Report&quot; had the country&#x27;s third-highest opening for a Steven Spielberg film, behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and its successor &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;.

The film then made $6.2 million in Italy in its first ten, $815,000 in its 75 location opening weekend in Belgium, and $405,000 in an 80 theater opening weekend in Switzerland. Meanwhile, in Turkey, it made $307,822 from 64 screens, achieving the third-highest opening for any 20th Century Fox film in the country, after &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;. The BBC felt the film&#x27;s UK performance was &quot;buoyed by Cruise&#x27;s charm offensive at last week&#x27;s London premiere.&quot;

&quot;Minority Report&quot; made a total of $132 million in the United States and $226.3 million overseas.

=== Home media ===
DreamWorks spent several million dollars marketing the film&#x27;s DVD and VHS releases. The campaign included a tie-in video game released by Activision, which contained a trailer for the movie&#x27;s DVD. &quot;Minority Report&quot; was successful in the home video market, selling at least four million DVDs in its first few months of release. The DVD took two years to produce. For the first time, Spielberg allowed filmmakers to shoot footage on the set of one of his films. &quot;Premiere&quot;-award-winning DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau, who would become a frequent Spielberg DVD collaborator, shot hundreds of hours of the film&#x27;s production in the brand new high-definition video format. It contained over an hour of featurettes which discussed various aspects of film production, included visual effects breakdowns of the film&#x27;s stunt sequences, and new interviews with Spielberg, Cruise, and other &quot;Academy Award-winning filmmakers&quot;.

The film was released on a two-disc Blu-ray by Paramount Home Entertainment (now the owner of the early DreamWorks library) on May 16, 2010. It included exclusive extras and interactive features, such as a new Spielberg interview, that were not included in the DVD edition. The film was transferred from its &quot;HD master&quot; which retained the distinctive grainy appearance.

=== Video game ===
A video game based on the film titled &quot;Minority Report: Everybody Runs&quot; was developed by Treyarch, published by Activision and released on November 18, 2002, for PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. It received mixed reviews.

== Reception ==
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Minority Report&quot; holds an 89% approval rating based on 260 reviews and an average rating of 8.20/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus is, &quot;Thought-provoking and visceral, Steven Spielberg successfully combines high concept ideas and high octane action in this fast and febrile sci-fi thriller.&quot; The website listed it among the best reviewed films of 2002. The film also earned an 80 out of a possible 100 on the similar review aggregating website Metacritic based on 37 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Most critics gave the film&#x27;s handling of its central theme (free will vs. determinism) positive reviews, and many ranked it as the film&#x27;s main strength. Other reviewers felt that Spielberg did not adequately tackle the issues he raised. The film has inspired discussion and analysis, the scope of which has been compared to the continuing analysis of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. This discussion has advanced past the realm of standard film criticism. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek fashioned a criticism of the Cheney Doctrine by comparing its preemptive strike methodology to that of the film&#x27;s PreCrime system.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; said it&#x27;s &quot;Spielberg&#x27;s sharpest, brawniest, most bustling entertainment since &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;&quot;. Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; felt it succeeded due to a &quot;breathless 140-minute pace with a no-flab script packed with all kinds of surprises.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the film&#x27;s visuals, and Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; complimented the cast&#x27;s performances. Film scholar Warren Buckland recommended the film, but felt that the comedic elements—aside from Stormare&#x27;s lines—detracted from the plot and undermined the film&#x27;s credibility.

Several critics used their reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the film signified in his development as a filmmaker. Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of the online magazine &quot;Salon&quot; expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie. &quot;Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now ... into of all things a superior film artist ... It&#x27;s too early to know whether &quot;Minority Report&quot;, on the heels of &quot;A.I.&quot;, marks a brief detour in Spielberg&#x27;s career or a permanent change of course, but either way it&#x27;s a dark and dazzling spectacle.&quot; J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said it is &quot;the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.&quot; Randy Shulman of &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; said that &quot;the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making.&quot;

Roger Ebert called the film a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and said that when most directors of the period were putting &quot;their trust in technology&quot;, Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing &quot;story and character&quot; while merely using technology as a &quot;workman uses his tools&quot;. Ebert eventually named the film the best film of the year. David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; echoed the positive sentiments, saying &quot;It has been a long time since a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, was less convinced. Though he approved of the film, he derided it in his review as a superficial action film, cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie but not &quot;be conned into thinking that some sort of serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride.&quot;

Andrew Sarris of the &quot;New York Observer&quot; gave the film a negative review in which he described the script as full of plot holes, the car chases as silly, and criticized the mixture of futuristic environments with &quot;defiantly retro costuming&quot;. The complexity of the storyline was also a source of criticism for Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who considered the plot &quot;too intricate and difficult to follow&quot;.

Rosenbaum and Hoberman both referred to the titular minority report as a &quot;red herring&quot;. More positive reviews have seen it similarly, but referred to it as a &quot;MacGuffin&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
The film earned nominations for many awards, including Best Sound Editing at the 75th Academy Awards, and Best Visual Effects at the BAFTAs.

It was nominated for eleven Saturn Awards including Best Actor for Cruise, Best Supporting Actor for von Sydow and Best Music for Williams, and won four: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Spielberg, Best Writing for Frank and Cohen and Supporting Actress for Morton.

It was nominated for two Visual Effects Society Awards in the categories of &quot;Best Effects Art Direction in a Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Best Compositing in a Motion Picture&quot;. It also won the BMI Film Music Award, the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Empire Awards for Best Actor for Cruise, Best Director for Spielberg and Best British Actress for Morton.

Ebert listed &quot;Minority Report&quot; as the best film of 2002, as did online film reviewer James Berardinelli. The film was also included in top ten lists by critic Richard Roeper, and both reviewers at &quot;USA Today&quot;.

====Retrospective honors====
In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated &quot;Minority Report&quot; for its Top 10 Science Fiction Films list.

Roger Ebert eventually named it one of his favorite films of the 2000s. Likewise, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; selected &quot;Minority Report&quot; as one of the 23 best films from 2000 to 2018.

==Television series==

On September 9, 2014, it was announced that a follow-up television series had been given a pilot commitment at Fox. Max Borenstein wrote the script and served as executive producer alongside Spielberg, Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank. The series was envisioned to be set 10 years after the film, and focused on a male precog who teams up with a female detective to find a purpose to his gift. On February 13, 2015, Daniel London and Li Jun Li joined the cast. On February 24, 2015, Laura Regan was cast as Agatha Lively, replacing Samantha Morton, who was said to have been offered to reprise the role.

In March 2015, Stark Sands and Meagan Good landed the lead roles with Sands playing the role of Dash, one of the male precogs, and Good playing Lara Vega, a detective haunted by her past, who works with Dash to help him find a purpose for his gift, Li Jun Li plays Akeela, a CSI technician, Daniel London reprised his role as Wally the Caretaker from the original film and Wilmer Valderrama was cast as a police detective.

The show was picked up to series by Fox on May 9, 2015, and made its broadcast debut on September 21, 2015, but was cancelled on May 13, 2016.

==Theater adaptation==
In 2023, it was announced that David Haig was working on a theatrical adaptation. The production had its world premiere in February 2024 at the Nottingham Playhouse. The story is set in London and the lead role was gender-swapped, becoming Dame Julia Anderton.

<text>The South Tynedale Railway is a preserved, narrow-gauge heritage railway in Northern England and at is England&#x27;s second highest narrow-gauge railway after the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway in north Devon. The South Tynedale line runs from Alston in Cumbria, down the South Tyne Valley, via Gilderdale, Kirkhaugh and Lintley, then across the South Tyne, Gilderdale and Whitley Viaducts to Slaggyford in Northumberland.

==Former line==
The narrow-gauge railway line is built on the track bed of the southern section of the former Alston Line, a standard gauge branch line between Haltwhistle and Alston which was closed by British Rail in May 1976.

==Operations==
The railway is operated by a charity, The South Tynedale Railway Preservation Society, which was registered in 1983.

Passenger trains operate on the railway from Spring to Autumn and attract 40,000 people to the district every year. Information about exact dates are on the railway&#x27;s web site. Special trains operate including Santa Special trains on certain days in December each year. Although no Santa trains ran in 2011 as volunteer efforts were put into completing the extension to Lintley in time for the 2012 season, they ran again in 2012 on two successive weekends, 15–16 and 22–23 December. In 2013 Santa trains ran on 14–15 and 21–22 December.

At Alston station there is a cafe and gift shop both operated by the railway company. Free car and coach parking is available adjacent to the station which is located about north of the town on Hexham road.

The line is currently in length, having been extended by a further to Slaggyford in July 2017. The STR is built on the southern section of the trackbed of the disused standard gauge Haltwhistle to Alston Branch Line, which formerly connected with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway at Haltwhistle.

The popular South Tyne Trail shares the trackbed with the railway, fenced off for safety. It is a walking and cycle trail that provides a cut-off for part of its length for the Pennine Way national trail.

The standard gauge branch line was closed by British Rail on 1 May 1976. The track bed is mostly intact, except at Lambley, where the station house and garden are in private ownership, and near Haltwhistle, where construction of the A69 Haltwhistle by-pass road severed the trackbed on the bypass itself and on an adjoining secondary road. The Society hope to eventually reopen the branch all the way to Haltwhistle.

==Signalling Infrastructure==

The signal box at Alston was dismantled when British Rail closed the branch so a new box had to be sought and erected. The replacement signal box at Alston formerly stood at Ainderby, on the branch line to Redmire, prior to being acquired from British Rail and re-erected on a new brick base. The level crossing barriers and mechanism came from the now-closed How Mill Station on the Newcastle and Carlisle line.

The signal box houses a 21 lever frame, made by McKenzie and Holland. In addition there is a manually operated gate machine to control the level crossing barriers – this combination of manual gate wheel and lifting barriers (rather that gates) being somewhat rare in the UK. The frame has had a varied life as it was constructed for the Highland Railway by McK&amp;H and first installed at Kingussie in Scotland. It was removed in 1926 when a replacement level crossing mechanism was installed in an emergency.

The frame had developed a crack and had to be sent to England to be repaired by Westinghouse, which had taken over McKenzie and Holland in 1920. The frame was then installed on the North Staffordshire Section of the LMS when a road at a level crossing was realigned to cross the railway. The old frame with the gate mechanism at this box was inadequate because of worn bearings so the repaired spare frame from Kingussie was installed by Westinghouse. It remained in service until the NS signal box closed. The frame was then sold to the South Tynedale railway and installed at its present location.

The signals are standard BR ones using a former LMS design, although the signal to the carriage sidings is an unusual semaphore ground signal mounted onto a conventional signal post.

==Developments==
Confirmation was received in November 2009 that a grant of £100,000 had been awarded by the Groundwork UK Community Spaces programme which will be used to fund the restoration of three historic railway bridges on the former Haltwhistle to Alston line.
Northumberland County Council&#x27;s west area committee also granted consent for a completely new station at Lintley and the new extension to Lintley opened to traffic on 1 April 2012. Rails extend across Lintley viaduct for a distance of about from the new station to form a headshunt for works trains.

The extended line from Kirkhaugh to Lintley Halt was officially opened in Saturday 12 May 2012 by Lord Inglewood, a long-time friend of the railway society.

On the same day Cumbria County Council handed over documents confirming a Community Asset Transfer of the Society&#x27;s leased land in Cumbria. Work to gain a similar status in Northumberland is ongoing with Northumberland County Council.

In September 2012 the Heritage Lottery Fund made an award that allows development work on a full bid for the Slaggyford extension to proceed. The bid also included innovative &#x27;green&#x27; initiatives to update the railway&#x27;s buildings, equipment and infrastructure in and around Alston. The final outcome of the bid is anticipated in January 2014.

In December 2012 a serious wash-out of a retaining wall about north of Alston Station threatened to stop the popular Santa trains. Quick work by the railway&#x27;s track gang to skew the main running line saved the day. The STR was left with a significant fund-raising issue to fully repair the 160-year-old wall, restore the lineside footpath and return the line to use. Temporary repairs were completed by mid-January 2013 whilst fundraising efforts continued to achieve a full repair. The main line was moved back to its proper alignment before the 2013 season began.

During January 2013 the railway society&#x27;s ambitions that, one day, trains will again run all the way from Alston to Haltwhistle moved a couple of steps closer. British Railways Board (Residuary) Ltd. improved upon and changed an earlier offer that now transfers a wide strip of land to the society. The land runs parallel to the Alston bay platform at Haltwhistle mainline station and provides sufficient space for proper station and run-round facilities for narrow-gauge trains. This important step allows the society to approach Network Rail for agreement to use its land alongside the platform and the platform itself. Additionally a small parcel of land that allows access to the station area from the Alston Arches Viaduct will be made available to the railway society.

In early February, the South Tynedale Railway joined the Heritage Skills Initiative and an engineering skills trainee will join the South Tynedale&#x27;s mainly volunteer workforce in March. The one-year project is in partnership with the North of England Civic Trust backed by a bursary and supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The scheme is specifically aimed at overcoming skills shortages in traditional engineering crafts. The new trainee will work alongside the railway&#x27;s skilled volunteer engineers looking after the railway&#x27;s locomotives and rolling stock. The new member of the railway&#x27;s team concentrated on developing a new works train to support the STR&#x27;s specialist permanent way team as they prepared for work on the extension from Lintley Halt to Slaggyford. The opening of the new extension was delayed, and finally opened in June 2018.

At the Annual General Meeting in November 2013 the railway society&#x27;s chairman signed agreements that handed responsibility for the viaducts at Lambley and Haltwhistle to the society. They were formerly owned by the now defunct North Pennine Heritage Trust. This important acquisition lays down further building blocks towards the society&#x27;s aim to eventually reopen the full length of the branch line.

On 4 February 2014 the STR announced a £5.5 million development project that includes just over £4.2 million awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.(source HLF and STR press information releases).

===2020 closure and administration===
The railway did not operate at all during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in September 2020 the operating company, South Tynedale Railway Ltd, went into administration. The attraction was awarded emergency funding from the Government, and resumed operations in July 2021, initially at weekends only.

==Passenger rolling stock==
Trains are made up daily depending on predicted passenger numbers. There are four all-steel open-ended gallery coaches built by a contractor in Alston, two wooden-bodied coaches and two brake vans constructed in the railway workshops. Additions to the fleet in 2011 were an all-steel buffet coach, originally built by Gloucester Carriage and Wagon for Sierra Leone Railways, and re-gauged from to for use at Alston, and a re-gauged former Romanian steel coach now converted to be fully accessible for disabled passengers.

2018 Season&lt;br&gt;
The timetable shows three return trips from Alston to Slaggyford. Outward trains leave from Alston at 1045, 1315 and 1515 hours. Return trains leave Slaggyford 55 minutes later. All trains stop at Kirkhaugh (reduced to a wayside halt) and Lintley. Trains run from late March until mid November but not every day. There are a series of special events spread over the year when special timetables may apply (source STRPS website).

<doc id="142051" wikidata="Q1811417" url="?curid=142051" title="The Minority Report">
<text>&quot;The Minority Report&quot; is a 1956 science fiction novella by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;. In a future society, three mutants foresee all crime before it occurs. Plugged into a great machine, these &quot;precogs&quot; allow a division of the police called Precrime to arrest suspects before they can commit any actual crimes. When the head of Precrime, John Anderton, is himself predicted to murder a man whom he has never heard of, Anderton is convinced a great conspiracy is afoot.

The story reflects many of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s personal Cold War anxieties, particularly questioning the relationship between authoritarianism and individual autonomy. Like many stories dealing with knowledge of future events, &quot;The Minority Report&quot; questions the existence of free will. The title refers to the dissenting opinion of one of the precogs.

In 2002, the story was adapted into a film directed by Steven Spielberg, which starred Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, and Max von Sydow. Spielberg&#x27;s film was followed by a series of the same name, which debuted on the Fox Broadcasting Company on September 21, 2015.

==Synopsis==
In a near-future version of the United States, John Allison Anderton is the aging creator and head police commissioner of the Precrime Division, in which three mutant humans called &quot;precogs&quot; predict all crimes before they occur. While showing his new second-in-command Ed Witwer around the premises, Anderton is shocked to receive a report that he, Anderton, is predicted to murder a man within the coming week. Believing Witwer has framed him in order to steal his job, Anderton tells his much younger wife Lisa, who is a fellow police official. Becoming paranoid, he soon suspects that she and Witwer may be joined in a conspiracy against him.

Knowing that a copy of the report is automatically sent to the Army as a safeguard, Anderton rushes home. He is suddenly abducted and brought before Leopold Kaplan, a retired general and Anderton&#x27;s expected murder victim, although the two have never met. Kaplan hears Anderton&#x27;s claims of ignorance, but still moves to hand him over to police custody. However, a mysterious man named Fleming crashes Anderton&#x27;s transport vehicle and, claiming that Anderton is being framed by Witwer, allows him to escape.

Anderton contacts a friend at Precrime to inquire about a &quot;minority report&quot;: a type of dissenting opinion in which one of the three precogs&#x27; predictions conflicts with those of the other two. Indeed, he learns that a minority report exists: one of the precogs predicted that Anderton would refrain from murdering Kaplan once he became aware of the situation. Anderton must now decide whether to remain silent and turn himself in, or speak up about the minority report and thus reveal a flaw that could discredit the entire Precrime system.

Lisa confronts Anderton, claiming that no conspiracy is taking place. She attempts to help him escape using a police helicopter, but Fleming ambushes and attacks her. Anderton subdues Fleming, revealing that the latter is one of Kaplan&#x27;s men. Anderton realizes that his escape and &quot;framing&quot; was staged by the military. By preventing Anderton from murdering Kaplan, while also preventing Anderton from being arrested, Kaplan hopes to destroy Precrime&#x27;s credibility by showing that arrested &quot;criminals&quot; may not always become guilty of the crimes they are predicted to commit. Anderton finally reads each of the precog reports, then goes to an Army rally where Kaplan is moments away from reading aloud Anderton&#x27;s minority report to the public. Before Kaplan is able to do so, Anderton shoots and kills him.

Anderton is arrested and both he and Lisa, as his accomplice, are scheduled for penal transportation to another planet. Before they leave Earth, Anderton explains to Witwer his reasoning for shooting Kaplan. After obtaining the three precog reports, he discovered that each of them predicted a different outcome. He further realized that the reports had not been generated simultaneously, and that each had been affected by his knowledge of all preceding ones. The first indicated that he would kill Kaplan in order to prevent Precrime from being discredited and shut down; the second predicted that, after reading the first, he would decide to not kill Kaplan. According to the third report, Kaplan had planned to discredit Precrime in order to enact a state of emergency and martial law, resulting in a military coup in which the Army would replace Precrime. Wanting to preserve the status quo, Anderton decided to fulfill the prediction and assassinate Kaplan rather than letting his own innocence destroy the system he helped create. The entire situation thus became a self-fulfilling prophecy. As Anderton and Lisa are about to be transported, Anderton warns Witwer, who has nervously inherited Anderton&#x27;s job, that the same predicament could happen to him at any time.

==Precrime==
Precrime is a predictive policing system dedicated to apprehending and detaining people before they have the opportunity to commit a given crime. At the time of the story, it has been operating for thirty years. This method has replaced the traditional system of discovering a crime and its perpetrator after the crime has already been committed, then issuing punishment after the fact. As Witwer says early on in the story, &quot;punishment was never much of a deterrent and could scarcely have afforded comfort to a victim already dead&quot;. Unlike the film adaptation, the story version of Precrime does not deal solely with cases of murder, but all crimes. As Commissioner John A. Anderton (the founder of Precrime) states, &quot;Precrime has cut down felonies by 99.8%.&quot;

Three mutants, known as &quot;precogs&quot;, have precognitive abilities they can use to see up to two weeks into the future. The precogs are strapped into machines, nonsensically babbling as a computer listens and converts this gibberish into predictions of the future. This information is transcribed onto conventional punched cards that are ejected into various coded slots. These cards appear simultaneously at Precrime and the army headquarters to prevent systemic corruption.

===Precogs===
Precogs are mutants, identified talents further developed in a government-operated training school—for example, one precog was initially diagnosed as &quot;a hydro-cephalic idiot&quot; but the precog talent was found under layers of damaged brain tissue. The precogs are kept in rigid position by metal bands, clamps and wiring, strapping them into special high-backed chairs. Their physical needs are taken care of automatically and Anderton claims that they have no spiritual needs. Their physical appearance is distorted from an ordinary human, with enlarged heads and wasted bodies. Precogs are &quot;deformed&quot; and &quot;retarded&quot; as &quot;the talent absorbs everything&quot;; &quot;the esp-lobe shrivels the balance of the frontal area&quot;. They do not understand their predictions; only through technological and mechanical aid can their nonsense be unraveled. The data produced does not always pertain to crime or murder, but this information is then passed on to other groups of people who use the precog necessities to create other future necessities.

===Majority and minority reports===
Each of the three precogs generates its own report or prediction. 
The reports of all the precogs are analyzed by a computer and, if these reports differ from one another, the computer identifies the two reports with the greatest overlap and produces a &quot;majority report&quot;, taking this as the accurate prediction of the future. But the existence of majority reports implies the existence of a &quot;minority report&quot;. In the story, Precrime Police Commissioner John A. Anderton believes that the prediction that he will commit a murder has been generated as a majority report. He sets out to find the minority report, which would give him an alternate future.

However, as Anderton finds out, sometimes all three reports differ quite significantly, and there may be no majority report, even though two reports may have had enough in common for the computer to link them as such. In the storyline, all of the reports about Anderton differ because they predict events occurring sequentially, and thus each is a minority report. Anderton&#x27;s situation is explained as unique, because he, as Police Commissioner, received notice of the precogs&#x27; predictions, allowing him to change his mind and invalidate earlier precog predictions.

===Multiple time paths===
The existence of three apparent minority reports suggests the possibility of three future time paths, all existing simultaneously, any of which an individual could choose to follow or be sent along following an enticement (as in Anderton&#x27;s being told he was going to murder an unknown man). In this way, the time-paths overlap, and the future of one is able to affect the past of another. It is in this way that the story weaves a complicated web of crossing time paths and makes a linear journey for Anderton harder to identify. This idea of multiple futures lets the precogs of Precrime be of benefit—because if only one time-path existed, the predictions of the precogs would be worthless since the future would be unalterable. Precrime is based on the notion that once one unpleasant future pathway is identified, an alternative, better one can be created with the arrest of the potential perpetrator.

===Police Commissioner John A. Anderton===
John A. Anderton is the protagonist of &quot;The Minority Report&quot;. At first, he is highly insecure, suspicious of those closest to him—his wife, his assistant Witwer. He has complete faith in the Precrime system and its authority over individuals and their freedom of choice. The poor living condition of the precogs and the imprisonment of would-be criminals are necessary consequences for the greater good of a safe society. When his own autonomy comes under attack, Anderton retains this faith and convinces himself that the system has somehow been corrupted.

Anderton struggles to find an appropriate balance between Precrime authority and individual liberty. Ultimately, Anderton decides to kill Leopold Kaplan to affirm the majority report and thereby preserve the validity of the Precrime system.

== Media adaptation==
*The 2002 film &quot;Minority Report&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg and with Tom Cruise as main actor, was based on the story.
*A video game, &quot;Minority Report: Everybody Runs&quot;, published in 2002 by Activision, was based on the film.
*A sequel television series, more than a decade after the events of the movie and also titled &quot;Minority Report&quot;, premiered on Fox on September 21, 2015.
*In September 2023, it was announced that David Haig was adapting the story for the stage, to premiere at the Lyric Hammersmith the following spring.

=== Differences between short story and film ===

*While the film uses the backdrop of Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Northern Virginia, the location of the original story is New York City. 
*In the story, John Anderton is a 50-year-old balding, out-of-shape police officer who created Precrime, while in the movie Anderton is in his late 30s, handsome, drug addict, athletic, with a full head of hair who joined Precrime after his son&#x27;s kidnapping. Instead, a man named Lamar Burgess creates Precrime. 
*Anderton&#x27;s wife in the short story is named Lisa, while his ex-wife in the film is named Lara.
*The precogs were originally named Mike, Donna, and Jerry, and were deformed and intellectually disabled. In the adaptation, they are called Agatha, Dashiell, and Arthur—after crime writers Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett, and Arthur Conan Doyle—children of drug addicts whose mutations led them to dream of future murders, which are captured by machines. They are &quot;deified&quot; by the Precrime officers, and are implied to be intelligent (Agatha guides Anderton successfully through a crowded mall while being pursued by Precrime, and the trio are seen reading large piles of books at the end of the film). In the end of the movie they retire to a rural cottage where they continue their lives in freedom and peace.
*In the short story, the precogs can see other crimes, not just murder. In the movie, the precogs can only clearly see murder.
*In the short story, Anderton&#x27;s future victim is General Leopold Kaplan, who wants to discredit Precrime in order to replace this police force with a military authority. At the end of the story, Anderton kills him to prevent the destruction of Precrime. In the movie, Anderton is supposed to kill someone named Leo Crow, but later finds out Crow is just part of a set up to prevent Anderton from discovering a different murder that his superior, Lamar Burgess, committed years ago. At the end of the film, Anderton confronts Burgess, who commits suicide and sends Precrime into oblivion.
*In the short story, Anderton seeks the precogs to hear their &quot;minority reports&quot;. In the movie, Anderton kidnaps a precog in order to discover his own &quot;minority report&quot; and extract the information for a mysterious crime.

<doc id="142056" wikidata="Q1744" url="?curid=142056" title="Madonna">
<text>Madonna Louise Ciccone ( ; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Commonly known as the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot;, she has been recognized for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting and visual presentation. Madonna&#x27;s works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A cultural icon spanning both the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna has become the subject of various scholarly, literary and artistic works, as well as a mini academic sub-discipline called Madonna studies.

Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy &amp; the Emmys, she rose to solo stardom with her 1983 eponymous debut album. Madonna has obtained a total of 18 multi-platinum albums, including &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984), &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990)—which became some of the best-selling albums in history—as well as &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005), her 21st-century bestseller. Her albums &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989), &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998), and &quot;Music&quot; (2000) were ranked among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s greatest albums of all time. Madonna&#x27;s catalog of top-charting songs includes &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;Material Girl&quot;, &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Hung Up&quot; and &quot;4 Minutes&quot;.

Her popularity was enhanced by roles in films such as &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992) and &quot;Evita&quot; (1996). While she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for the lattermost, many of her other films were not well received. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded the company Maverick in 1992, which included Maverick Records, one of the most successful artist-run labels in history. Her other ventures include fashion brands, written works, health clubs and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded the Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006, and advocates for gender equality and LGBT rights.

Madonna is the world&#x27;s best-selling female recording artist of all time and the first female performer to accumulate US$1 billion from her concerts. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and has achieved 44 number-one singles in between major global music markets. Her accolades include seven Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, 20 MTV Video Music Awards, 17 Japan Gold Disc Awards, and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. On &quot;Forbes&quot; annual rankings, Madonna became the world&#x27;s highest-paid female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s–2010s). &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the Artist of the Decade (1980s), the Greatest Dance Artist of All Time, and the Greatest Music Video Artist of All Time. She was also listed among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s greatest artists and greatest songwriters ever.

== Life and career ==
=== 1958–1978: Early life ===
Madonna Louise Ciccone was born in Bay City, Michigan, on August 16, 1958, to Roman Catholic parents Madonna Louise (née Fortin) and Silvio Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Ciccone. Her father&#x27;s parents were Italian emigrants from Pacentro while her mother was of French-Canadian descent. Tony Ciccone worked as an optics engineer for Chrysler Defense and its successor, General Dynamics Land Systems, on military projects. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her &quot;Little Nonnie&quot;. Her mother died of breast cancer on December 1, 1963, when Madonna was five years old. Madonna grew up in the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills), alongside her two older brothers—Anthony (1956–2023) and Martin (born 1957)—and three younger siblings—Paula (born 1959), Christopher (1960–2024), and Melanie (born 1962). Madonna adopted Veronica as a confirmation name upon receiving the sacrament in the Catholic Church in 1966.
Tony married the family&#x27;s housekeeper, Joan Gustafson, that same year. They remained married for 58 years until Joan&#x27;s death in 2024, and had three children: Jennifer (born 1967), Mario (born 1968), and Joey (who died shortly after his 1967 birth from a heart defect).

Madonna attended St. Frederick&#x27;s and St. Andrew&#x27;s Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. She was known for her high grade point average (GPA) and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. Madonna would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear. She later admitted to seeing herself in her youth as a &quot;lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn&#x27;t rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn&#x27;t shave my underarms or legs, and I didn&#x27;t wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades... I wanted to be somebody.&quot;

Madonna&#x27;s father put her in classical piano lessons, but she later convinced him to allow her to take ballet lessons. Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, persuaded her to pursue a career in dance. Madonna later attended Rochester Adams High School and became a straight-A student as well as a member of its cheerleading squad. After graduating in January 1976, she received a dance scholarship to the University of Michigan and studied over the summer at the American Dance Festival in Durham, North Carolina.

In 1978, Madonna dropped out of college and relocated to New York City. She said of her move to New York, &quot;It was the first time I&#x27;d ever taken a plane, the first time I&#x27;d ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I&#x27;d ever done.&quot; Madonna soon found an apartment in the Alphabet City neighborhood of the East Village and had little money while working as a hatcheck girl for the Russian Tea Room, an elevator operator at Terrace on the Park, and with modern dance troupes. She took classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, eventually performing with Pearl Lang Dance Theater. She also studied dance under the tutelage of the noted American dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. Madonna started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. One night, while returning from a rehearsal, a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. She later found the incident to be &quot;a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it.&quot;

=== 1979–1983: Career beginnings, rock bands, and &quot;Madonna&quot; ===
In 1979, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy. Shortly after meeting him, she successfully auditioned to perform in Paris with French disco artist Patrick Hernandez as his backup singer and dancer. During her three months with Hernandez&#x27;s troupe, she also traveled to Tunisia before returning to New York in August 1979. Madonna moved into an abandoned synagogue where Gilroy lived and rehearsed in Corona, Queens. Together they formed her first band, the Breakfast Club, for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar. While with the band, Madonna briefly worked as a hat-check girl at the Russian Tea Room, and she made her acting debut in the low-budget indie film &quot;A Certain Sacrifice&quot;, which was not released until 1985. In 1980, Madonna left the Breakfast Club with drummer Stephen Bray, who was her boyfriend in Michigan, and they formed the band Emmy and the Emmys. They rekindled their romance and moved into the Music Building in Manhattan. The two began writing songs together and they recorded a four-song demo tape in November 1980, but soon after, Madonna decided to promote herself as a solo artiste.

In March 1981, Camille Barbone, who ran Gotham Records in the Music Building, signed Madonna to a contract with Gotham and worked as her manager until February 1982. Madonna frequented nightclubs to get disc jockeys to play her demo. DJ Mark Kamins at Danceteria took an interest in her music and they began dating. Kamins arranged a meeting with Madonna and Seymour Stein, the president of Sire Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records. Madonna signed a deal for a total of three singles, with an option for an album.

Kamins produced her debut single, &quot;Everybody&quot;, which was released in October 1982. In December 1982, Madonna performed the song live for the first time at Danceteria. She made her first television appearance performing &quot;Everybody&quot; on &quot;Dancin&#x27; On Air&quot; in January 1983, although it had actually been filmed a month prior. In February 1983, she promoted the single with nightclub performances in the United Kingdom. Her second single, the double A-side &quot;Burning Up&quot; / &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;, was released in March 1983. Both this single and &quot;Everybody&quot; reached number three on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;Burning Up&quot; / &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; also charted at number 13 in Australia. During this period, Madonna was in a relationship with artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and living at his loft in SoHo. Basquiat introduced her to art curator Diego Cortez, who had managed some punk bands and co-founded the Mudd Club. Madonna invited Cortez to be her manager, but he declined.

Following the success of the singles, Warner hired Reggie Lucas to produce her debut album, &quot;Madonna&quot;. However, Madonna was dissatisfied with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas&#x27; production techniques, so she decided to seek additional help. She asked John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez, the resident DJ at Fun House, to help finish the album&#x27;s production and a romance ensued. Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced &quot;Holiday&quot;, which was her first international top-ten song. The album was released in July 1983, and peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It yielded two top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. In late 1983, Madonna&#x27;s new manager, Freddy DeMann, secured a meeting for her with film producer Jon Peters, who asked her to play the part of a club singer in the romantic drama &quot;Vision Quest&quot;.

=== 1984–1987: &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, first marriage, &quot;True Blue&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; ===

In January 1984, Madonna gained more exposure by performing on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Her image, performances and music videos influenced many young girls and women. Madonna&#x27;s style became one of the female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets and bleached hair. Madonna&#x27;s popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK and the US. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; became the first album by a female to sell over five million copies in the US. It was later certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold over 21 million copies worldwide.

The album&#x27;s title track served as its first single, and topped the Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks. It attracted the attention of conservative organizations who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values, and moralists sought to have the song and video banned. Madonna received huge media coverage for her performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; at the first 1984 MTV Video Music Awards. Wearing a wedding dress and white gloves, Madonna appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake and then rolled around suggestively on the floor. MTV retrospectively considered it one of the &quot;most iconic&quot; pop performances of all time. The second single, &quot;Material Girl&quot;, reached number two on the Hot 100. While filming the single&#x27;s music video, Madonna started dating actor Sean Penn. They married on her birthday in 1985.

Madonna entered mainstream films in February 1985, beginning with her cameo in &quot;Vision Quest&quot;. The soundtrack contained two new singles, her US number-one single, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, and another track &quot;Gambler&quot;. She also played the title role in the 1985 comedy &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, a film which introduced the song &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, her first number-one single in the UK. Her popularity caused the film to be perceived as a Madonna vehicle, despite how she was not billed as a lead actress. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Vincent Canby named it one of the ten best films of 1985.

Beginning in April 1985, Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America, the Virgin Tour, with the Beastie Boys as her opening act. The tour saw the peak of Madonna wannabe phenomenon, with many female attendees dressing like her. At that time, she released two more songs, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, making all four singles from the album peak inside the top five on the Hot 100 chart. &quot;Angel&quot; also topped the Australian charts. In July, &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna, taken when she moonlighted as an art model in 1978. She had posed for the photographs because she needed money at the time, and was paid as little as $25 a session. The publication of the photos caused a media uproar, but Madonna remained &quot;unapologetic and defiant&quot;. The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $100,000. She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert, saying that she would not take her jacket off because &quot;[the media] might hold it against me ten years from now.&quot;

In June 1986, Madonna released her third studio album, &quot;True Blue&quot;, which was inspired by and dedicated to her husband Penn. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was impressed with the effort, writing that the album &quot;sound[s] as if it comes from the heart&quot;. Five singles were released—&quot;Live to Tell&quot;, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;—all of which reached number one in the US or the UK. The album topped the charts in 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and remains Madonna&#x27;s bestselling studio album, with sales of 25 million copies. &quot;True Blue&quot; was featured in the 1992 edition of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the bestselling album by a woman of all time.

Madonna starred in the critically panned film &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; in 1986, for which she received her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. She made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Goose and Tom-Tom&quot;; the film and play both co-starred Penn. The next year, Madonna was featured in the film &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;. She contributed four songs to its soundtrack, including the title track and &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;. Madonna embarked on the Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour in June 1987, which continued until September. It broke several attendance records, including over 130,000 people in a show near Paris, which was then a record for the highest-attended female concert of all time. Later that year, she released a remix album of past hits, &quot;You Can Dance&quot;, which reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After a tumultuous two years&#x27; marriage, Madonna filed for divorce from Penn on December 4, 1987, but withdrew the petition a few weeks later.

=== 1988–1991: &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, and &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; ===
She made her Broadway debut in the production of &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot; at the Royale Theatre from May to August 1988. According to the Associated Press, Madonna filed an assault report against Penn after an alleged incident at their Malibu home during the New Year&#x27;s weekend. Madonna filed for divorce on January 5, 1989, and the following week she reportedly asked that no criminal charges be pressed.

In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer Pepsi. In one Pepsi commercial, she debuted &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, the lead single and title track from her fourth studio album. The music video featured Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning, and a dream of making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract. &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; topped the charts in many countries, becoming her seventh number-one on the Hot 100.

Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the album &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; with Patrick Leonard, Stephen Bray, and Prince. Music critic J. D. Considine from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised it &quot;as close to art as pop music gets ... proof not only that Madonna should be taken seriously as an artist but that hers is one of the most compelling voices of the Eighties.&quot; &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 15 million copies worldwide. Other successful singles from the album were &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot;, which both peaked at number two in the US, as well as the UK top-five &quot;Dear Jessie&quot; and the US top-ten &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. By the end of the 1980s, Madonna was named as the &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; by MTV, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Musician&quot; magazine.

Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), with Warren Beatty playing the title role. The film went to number one on the US box office for two weeks and Madonna received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. To accompany the film, she released the soundtrack album, &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;, which included songs inspired by the film&#x27;s 1930s setting. It also featured the US number-one song &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;. While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with Beatty, which dissolved shortly after the premiere.

In April 1990, Madonna began her Blond Ambition World Tour, which ended in August. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it an &quot;elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza&quot; and proclaimed it &quot;the best tour of 1990&quot;. The tour generated strong negative reaction from religious groups for her performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation. In response, Madonna said, &quot;The tour in no way hurts anybody&#x27;s sentiments. It&#x27;s for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others&quot;. The live recording of the tour won Madonna her first Grammy Award, in the category of Best Long Form Music Video. In October 1990, Madonna lent her voice to a Public Service Announcement (PSA) supporting Rock the Vote&#x27;s efforts in voter registration.

Madonna&#x27;s first greatest-hits compilation album, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990), was released in November including two new songs, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history. &quot;Justify My Love&quot; reached number one in the US becoming her ninth number-one on the Hot 100. Her then-boyfriend model Tony Ward co-starred in the music video, which featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network. Her first documentary film, &quot;&quot; (known as &quot;In Bed with Madonna&quot; outside North America), was released in May 1991. Chronicling her Blond Ambition World Tour, it became the highest-grossing documentary of all time (surpassed eleven years later by Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;).

=== 1992–1997: Maverick, &quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, and motherhood ===

In 1992, Madonna starred in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; as Mae Mordabito, a baseball player on an all-women&#x27;s team. It reached number one on the box-office and became the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year in the US. She recorded the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot;, which became her tenth number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the most by any female artist at the time. In April, Madonna founded her own entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing, and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, the highest rate in the industry at the time, equaled only by Michael Jackson&#x27;s royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Her company later went on to become one of the most successful artist-run labels in history, producing multi-platinum artists such as Alanis Morissette and Michelle Branch. Later that year, Madonna co-sponsored the first museum retrospective for her former boyfriend artist Jean-Michel Basquiat at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.
In October 1992, Madonna simultaneously released her fifth studio album, &quot;Erotica&quot;, and her coffee table book, &quot;Sex&quot;. Consisting of sexually provocative and explicit images, photographed by Steven Meisel, the book received strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million copies at $50 each in a matter of days. The widespread backlash overshadowed &quot;Erotica&quot;, which ended up as her lowest selling album at the time. Despite positive reviews, it became her first studio album since her debut album not to score any chart-topper in the US. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two. It yielded the Hot 100 top-ten hits &quot;Erotica&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;. At the time Madonna had been dating rapper Vanilla Ice and she at one point proposed to him. They broke up following the release of &quot;Sex&quot;, with Ice claiming that he was included in the book without his consent. Madonna continued her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. Critics poorly received the film. She also starred in the film &quot;Dangerous Game&quot;, which was released straight to video in North America. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;angry and painful, and the pain feels real.&quot;

In September 1993, Madonna embarked on the Girlie Show, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island&#x27;s flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit book, album, and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, commenting that &quot;she had gone too far&quot; and her career was over. Around this time, Madonna briefly dated rapper Tupac Shakur and basketball player Dennis Rodman.

Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli described her ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember&quot; (1994) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image. The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;With Honors&quot;. She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction to sustain her popularity. With her sixth studio album, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994), Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and generated two US top-five hits, &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks, the longest period of any Madonna single. &quot;Something to Remember&quot;, a collection of ballads, was released in November 1995. The album featured three new songs: &quot;You&#x27;ll See&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, and a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;I Want You&quot;. An enthusiastic collector of modern art, Madonna sponsored the first major retrospective of Tina Modotti&#x27;s work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1995. The following year, she sponsored an exhibition of Basquiat&#x27;s paintings at the Serpentine Gallery in London. The following year, she sponsored artist Cindy Sherman&#x27;s retrospective at the MoMA in New York.
In February 1996, Madonna began filming the musical &quot;Evita&quot; in Argentina. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Argentine political leader Eva Perón and wrote to director Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. After securing the title role, she received vocal coaching and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During filming Madonna became ill several times, after finding out that she was pregnant, and from the intense emotional effort required with the scenes. Upon &quot;Evita&quot;″s release in December 1996, Madonna&#x27;s performance received praise from film critics. Zach Conner of &quot;Time&quot; magazine remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a relief to say that &quot;Evita&quot; is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations.&quot; For the role, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

The &quot;Evita&quot; soundtrack, containing songs mostly performed by Madonna, was released as a double album. It included &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;; the latter reached number one in countries across Europe. Madonna was presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, she gave birth to Lourdes &quot;Lola&quot; Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with fitness trainer Carlos Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna often worried that her pregnancy would harm &quot;Evita&quot;, she reached some important personal goals: &quot;Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public.&quot; Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997 and she declared that they were &quot;better off as best friends&quot;.

=== 1998–2002: &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, second marriage, and touring comeback ===
After Lourdes&#x27;s birth, Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, introduced to her by actress Sandra Bernhard. Her seventh studio album, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit &quot;was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave were happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That&#x27;s not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that.&quot;

The album garnered critical acclaim, with &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; calling it &quot;one of the great pop masterpieces of the &#x27;90s&quot; &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was honored with four Grammy Awards—including Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording—and was nominated for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it among &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Commercially, the album peaked at number-one in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Frozen&quot;, became Madonna&#x27;s first single to debut at number one in the UK, while in the US, it became her sixth number-two single, setting another record for Madonna as the artist with the most number-two hits. The second single, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The 1998 edition of &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; documented that &quot;no female artist has sold more records than Madonna around the world&quot;.

Madonna founded Ray of Light Foundation which focused on women, education, global development and humanitarian. She recorded the single &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; for the 1999 film &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, which earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Madonna starred in the 2000 comedy-drama film &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;, directed by John Schlesinger. The film opened at number two on the US box office with $5.9 million grossed in its first week, but this quickly diminished. She also contributed two songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack—a cover of Don McLean&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;American Pie&quot; and an original song &quot;Time Stood Still&quot;—the former became her ninth UK number-one single.

Madonna released her eighth studio album, &quot;Music&quot;, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired &quot;Ray of Light&quot; era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: &quot;I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. &quot;Music&quot; is the future of sound.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that &quot;&quot;Music&quot; blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it&#x27;s easily as self-aware and earnest as &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.&quot; The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the US, &quot;Music&quot; debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;. The music video of &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.

Madonna met director Guy Ritchie in mid-1998, and gave birth to their son Rocco John Ritchie in Los Angeles on August 11, 2000. Rocco and Madonna suffered complications from the birth due to her experiencing placenta praevia. He was christened at Dornoch Cathedral in Dornoch, Scotland, on December 21, 2000. Madonna married Ritchie the following day at nearby Skibo Castle. After an eight-year absence from touring, Madonna started her Drowned World Tour in June 2001. The tour visited cities in the US and Europe and was the highest-grossing concert tour of the year by a solo artist, earning $75 million from 47 sold-out shows. She also released her second greatest-hits collection, &quot;GHV2&quot;, which compiled 15 singles during the second decade of her recording career. The album debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold seven million units worldwide.

Madonna starred in the film &quot;Swept Away&quot;, directed by Ritchie. Released direct-to-video in the UK, the film was a commercial and critical failure. In May 2002 she appeared in London in the West End play &quot;Up for Grabs&quot; at the Wyndhams Theatre (billed as &#x27;Madonna Ritchie&#x27;), to universally bad reviews and was described as &quot;the evening&#x27;s biggest disappointment&quot; by one. That October, she released &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, the title song of the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, in which she also had a cameo role, described by Peter Bradshaw from &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;incredibly wooden&quot;. The song reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;American Life&quot; and &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; ===

In 2003, Madonna collaborated with fashion photographer Steven Klein for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, which ran from March to May in New York&#x27;s Deitch Projects gallery, and also traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, &quot;American Life&quot;, which was based on her observations of American society. She explained that the record was &quot;like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I&#x27;ve accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me.&quot; Larry Flick from &quot;The Advocate&quot; felt that &quot;&quot;American Life&quot; is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent&quot;, while also condemning it as &quot;a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously.&quot; The original music video of its title track caused controversy due to its violence and anti-war imagery, and was withdrawn after the 2003 invasion of Iraq started. Madonna voluntarily censored herself for the first time in her career due to the political climate of the country, saying that &quot;there was a lynch mob mentality that was going on that wasn&#x27;t pretty and I have children to protect.&quot; The song stalled at number 37 on the Hot 100, while the album became her lowest-selling album at that point with four million copies worldwide.

Madonna gave another provocative performance later that year at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, when she kissed singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera while singing the track &quot;Hollywood&quot;. In October 2003, she provided guest vocals on Spears&#x27; single &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;. It was followed with the release of &quot;Remixed &amp; Revisited&quot;. The EP contained remixed versions of songs from &quot;American Life&quot; and included &quot;Your Honesty&quot;, a previously unreleased track from the &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; recording sessions. Madonna also signed a contract with Callaway Arts &amp; Entertainment to be the author of five children&#x27;s books. The first of these books, titled &quot;The English Roses&quot;, was published in September 2003. The story was about four English schoolgirls and their envy and jealousy of each other. The book debuted at the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and became the fastest-selling children&#x27;s picture book of all time. Madonna donated all of its proceeds to a children&#x27;s charity.

The next year Madonna and Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own. The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. Madonna and Dashev&#x27;s company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.

In mid-2004, Madonna embarked on the Re-Invention World Tour in the US, Canada and Europe. It became the highest-grossing tour of 2004, earning around $120 million and became the subject of her documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell You a Secret&quot;. In November 2004, she was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as one of its five founding members, along with the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley and U2. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked her at number 36 on its special issue of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, featuring an article about her written by Britney Spears. In January 2005, Madonna performed a cover version of the John Lennon song &quot;Imagine&quot; at Tsunami Aid. She also performed at the Live 8 benefit concert in London in July 2005.

Her tenth studio album, &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot;, was released in November 2005. Musically the album was structured like a club set composed by a DJ. It was acclaimed by critics, with Keith Caulfield from &quot;Billboard&quot; commenting that the album was a &quot;welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop.&quot; The album won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; and its lead single, &quot;Hung Up&quot;, went on to reach number one in 40 and 41 countries respectively, earning a place in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The song contained a sample of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;, only the second time that ABBA has allowed their work to be used. ABBA songwriter Björn Ulvaeus remarked &quot;It is a wonderful track—100 per cent solid pop music.&quot; &quot;Sorry&quot;, the second single, became Madonna&#x27;s twelfth number-one single in the UK.

Madonna embarked on the Confessions Tour in May 2006, which had a global audience of 1.2 million and grossed over $193.7 million, becoming the highest-grossing tour to that date for a female artist. Madonna used religious symbols, such as the crucifix and Crown of Thorns, in the performance of &quot;Live to Tell&quot;. It caused the Russian Orthodox Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia to urge all their members to boycott her concert. At the same time, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) announced officially that Madonna had sold over 200 million copies of her albums alone worldwide.

While on tour, Madonna founded the charitable organization Raising Malawi, and partially funded an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, saying that there were no written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. Madonna described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when they first met. Banda&#x27;s biological father, Yohane, commented: &quot;These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband.&quot; The adoption was finalized in May 2008.

=== 2007–2011: Filmmaking, &quot;Hard Candy&quot;, and business ventures ===
Madonna released and performed the song &quot;Hey You&quot; at the London Live Earth concert in July 2007. She announced her departure from Warner Bros. Records, and declared a new $120 million, ten-year 360 deal with Live Nation. In 2008, Madonna produced and wrote &quot;I Am Because We Are&quot;, a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians; it was directed by Nathan Rissman, who worked as Madonna&#x27;s gardener. She also directed her first film, &quot;Filth and Wisdom&quot;. The plot of the film revolved around three friends and their aspirations. &quot;The Times&quot; said she had &quot;done herself proud&quot; while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the film as &quot;not an entirely unpromising first effort [but] Madonna would do well to hang on to her day job.&quot; On March 10, 2008, Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. She did not sing at the ceremony but asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and Michigan natives the Stooges to perform her songs &quot;Burning Up&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.
Madonna released her eleventh studio album, &quot;Hard Candy&quot;, in April 2008. Containing R&amp;B and urban pop influences, the songs on &quot;Hard Candy&quot; were autobiographical in nature and saw Madonna collaborating with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills. The album debuted at number one in 37 countries and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Caryn Ganz from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; complimented it as an &quot;impressive taste of her upcoming tour&quot;, while BBC correspondent Mark Savage panned it as &quot;an attempt to harness the urban market&quot;.

&quot;4 Minutes&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was Madonna&#x27;s 37th top-ten hit on the chart and pushed her past Elvis Presley as the artist with the most top-ten hits. In the UK she retained her record for the most number-one singles for a female artist; &quot;4 Minutes&quot; becoming her thirteenth. To further promote the album, she embarked on the Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour, her first major venture with Live Nation. With a total gross of $408 million, it ended up as the second highest-grossing tour of all time, behind the Rolling Stones&#x27;s A Bigger Bang Tour. It remained the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist until Roger Waters&#x27; the Wall Live surpassed it in 2013.

In July 2008, Christopher Ciccone released a book titled &quot;Life with My Sister Madonna&quot;, which caused a rift between Madonna and him, because of unsolicited publication. By fall, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. In December 2008, Madonna&#x27;s spokesperson announced that Madonna had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which granted him between £50–60 million ($– million), a figure that included the couple&#x27;s London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England. The marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by &quot;decree nisi&quot; at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. They entered a compromise agreement for Rocco and David, then aged eight and three respectively, and divided the children&#x27;s time between Ritchie&#x27;s London home and Madonna&#x27;s in New York, where the two were joined by Lourdes. Soon after, Madonna applied to adopt Chifundo &quot;Mercy&quot; James from Malawi in May 2009, but the country&#x27;s High Court rejected the application because Madonna was not a resident there. She re-appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted her the right to adopt Mercy.

Madonna concluded her contract with Warner by releasing her third greatest-hits album, &quot;Celebration&quot;, in September 2009. It contained the new songs &quot;Celebration&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; along with 34 hits spanning her musical career with the label. &quot;Celebration&quot; reached number one in several countries, including Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. She appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to speak in tribute to deceased pop singer Michael Jackson. Madonna ended the 2000s as the bestselling single artist of the decade in the US and the most-played artist of the decade in the UK. &quot;Billboard&quot; also announced her as the third top-touring artist of the decade—behind only the Rolling Stones and U2—with a gross of over $801 million, 6.3 million attendance and 244 sell-outs of 248 shows.
Madonna performed at the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief concert in January 2010. Her third live album, &quot;Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour&quot;, was released in April, debuting at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also became her 20th top-ten on the Oricon Albums Chart, breaking the Beatles&#x27; record for the most top-ten album by an international act in Japan. Madonna granted American television show, &quot;Glee&quot;, the rights to her entire catalog of music, and the producers created an episode featuring her songs exclusively. She also collaborated with Lourdes and released the Material Girl clothing line, inspired by her punk-girl style when she rose to fame in the 1980s. In October, she opened a series of fitness centers around the world named Hard Candy Fitness, and three months later unveiled a second fashion brand called Truth or Dare which included footwear, perfumes, underclothing, and accessories.

Madonna directed her second feature film, &quot;W.E.&quot;, a biographical account about the affair between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. Co-written with Alek Keshishian, the film was premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in September 2011. Critical and commercial response to the film was negative. Madonna contributed the ballad &quot;Masterpiece&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

=== 2012–2016: Super Bowl XLVI halftime show, &quot;MDNA&quot;, and &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; ===

In February 2012, Madonna headlined the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. Her performance was visualized by Cirque Du Soleil and Jamie King, and featured special guests LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. and CeeLo Green. It became the then most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history with 114 million viewers, higher than the game itself. During the event, she performed &quot;Give Me All Your Luvin&#x27;&quot;, the lead single from her twelfth studio album, &quot;MDNA&quot;. It became her record-extending 38th top-ten single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;MDNA&quot; was released in March 2012 and saw collaboration with various producers, including William Orbit and Martin Solveig. It was her first release under her three-album deal with Interscope Records, which she signed as a part of her 360 deal with Live Nation. She was signed to the record label since Live Nation was unable to distribute music recordings. &quot;MDNA&quot; became Madonna&#x27;s fifth consecutive studio record to debut at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was mostly promoted by the MDNA Tour, which lasted from May to December 2012. The tour featured controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. With a gross of $305.2 million from 88 sold-out shows, it became the highest-grossing tour of 2012 and then-tenth highest-grossing tour of all time. Madonna was named the top-earning celebrity of the year by &quot;Forbes,&quot; earning an estimated $125 million.

Madonna collaborated with Steven Klein and directed a 17-minute film, &quot;secretprojectrevolution&quot;, which was released on BitTorrent in September 2013. With the film she launched the Art for Freedom initiative, which helped to promote &quot;art and free speech as a means to address persecution and injustice across the globe&quot;. The website for the project included over 3,000 art related submissions since its inception, with Madonna regularly monitoring and enlisting other artists like David Blaine and Katy Perry as guest curators.

By 2013, Madonna&#x27;s Raising Malawi had built ten schools to educate 4,000 children in Malawi at a value of $400,000. When Madonna visited the schools in April 2013, President of Malawi Joyce Banda accused her of exaggerating the charity&#x27;s contribution. Madonna was saddened by Banda&#x27;s statement, but clarified that she had &quot;no intention of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations&quot;. It was later confirmed that Banda had not approved the statement released by her press team. Madonna also visited her hometown Detroit during May 2014, and donated funds to help with the city&#x27;s bankruptcy. The same year, her business ventures extended to skin care products with the launch of MDNA Skin in Tokyo, Japan.

Madonna&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;Rebel Heart&quot;, was released in March 2015, three months after its thirteen demos leaked onto the internet. Unlike her previous efforts, which involved only a few people, Madonna worked with a large number of collaborators, including Avicii, Diplo and Kanye West. Introspection was listed as one of the foundational themes prevalent on the record, along with &quot;genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection&quot;. Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for &quot;Rebel Heart&quot;. Music critics responded positively towards the album, calling it her best effort in a decade.
From September 2015 to March 2016, Madonna embarked on the Rebel Heart Tour to promote the album. The tour traveled throughout North America, Europe and Asia and was Madonna&#x27;s first visit to Australia in 23 years, where she also performed a for her fans. The Rebel Heart Tour grossed a total of $169.8 million from the 82 shows, with over 1.045 million ticket sales. While on tour, Madonna became engaged in a legal battle with Ritchie, over the custody of their son Rocco. The dispute started when Rocco decided to continue living in England with Ritchie when the tour had visited there, while Madonna wanted him to travel with her. Court hearings took place in both New York and London. After multiple deliberations, Madonna withdrew her application for custody and decided to resolve the matter privately.

In October 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Madonna its Woman of the Year. Her &quot;blunt and brutally honest&quot; speech about ageism and sexism at the ceremony received widespread coverage in the media. The next month Madonna, who actively supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election, performed an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park in support of Clinton&#x27;s campaign. Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women&#x27;s March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. She sparked controversy when she said that she &quot;thought a lot about blowing up the White House&quot;. The following day, Madonna asserted she was &quot;not a violent person&quot; and that her words had been &quot;taken wildly out of context&quot;.

=== 2017–2021: Move to Lisbon and &quot;Madame X&quot; ===
In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Estere and Stella, and she moved to live in Lisbon, Portugal, in mid-2017 with her adoptive children. In July, she opened the Mercy James Institute for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care in Malawi, a children&#x27;s hospital built by her Raising Malawi charity. The live album chronicling the Rebel Heart Tour was released in September 2017, and won Best Music Video for Western Artists at the 32nd Japan Gold Disc Award. That month, Madonna launched MDNA Skin in select stores in the United States. A few months earlier, the auction house Gotta Have Rock and Roll had put up Madonna&#x27;s personal items like love letters from Tupac Shakur, cassettes, underwear and a hairbrush for sale. Darlene Lutz, an art dealer who had initiated the auction, was sued by Madonna&#x27;s representatives to stop the proceedings. Madonna clarified that her celebrity status &quot;does not obviate my right to maintain my privacy, including with regard to highly personal items&quot;. Madonna lost the case and the presiding judge ruled in favor of Lutz who was able to prove that in 2004 Madonna made a legal agreement with her for selling the items.

While living in Lisbon, Madonna met Dino D&#x27;Santiago, who introduced her to many local musicians playing fado, morna and samba music. They regularly invited her to their &quot;living room sessions&quot;, thus she was inspired to make her 14th studio album, &quot;Madame X&quot;. Madonna produced the album with several musicians, primarily her longtime collaborator Mirwais and Mike Dean. The album was critically well received, with &quot;NME&quot; deeming it &quot;bold, bizarre, self-referential and unlike anything Madonna has ever done before.&quot; Released in June 2019, &quot;Madame X&quot; debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her ninth number-one album there. All four of its singles—&quot;Medellín&quot;, &quot;Crave&quot;, &quot;I Rise&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Search I Find&quot;—topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart, extending her record for most number-one entries on the chart.
The previous month, Madonna appeared as the interval act at the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 and performed &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, and then &quot;Future&quot; with rapper Quavo. Her Madame X Tour, an all-theatre tour in select cities across North America and Europe, began on September 17, 2019. In addition to much smaller venues compared to her previous tours, she implemented a no-phone policy to maximize the intimacy of the concert. According to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, the tour earned $51.4 million in ticket sales. That December, Madonna started dating Ahlamalik Williams, a dancer who began accompanying her on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015. However, the Madame X Tour faced several cancellations due to her recurring knee injury, and eventually ended abruptly on March 8, 2020, three days before its planned final date, after the French government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to COVID-19 pandemic. She later revealed she had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. In April 2020, Madonna announced her financial support for the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator led by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust and Mastercard, and donated an additional $1 million to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to help fund research creating a new vaccine.

Madonna and Missy Elliott provided guest vocals on Dua Lipa&#x27;s single &quot;Levitating&quot;, from Lipa&#x27;s 2020 remix album &quot;Club Future Nostalgia&quot;. She also started work on a film biopic about her life, which she intended to direct. Erin Cressida Wilson and Diablo Cody worked on the script at various points and Julia Garner was cast as Madonna before the project was postponed. Madonna released &quot;Madame X&quot;, a documentary film chronicling the tour of the same name, on Paramount+ in October 2021.

=== 2022–2024: &quot;Finally Enough Love&quot;, the Celebration Tour ===
On Madonna&#x27;s 63rd birthday, she officially announced her return to Warner Bros. Records in a global partnership which granted the label rights to her entire recorded music catalog, including the last three albums released under Interscope. Under the contract, Madonna launched a series of catalog reissues beginning in 2022, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of her recording career. A remix album titled &quot;Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones&quot; was released on August 19, with a 16-track abridged edition being available for streaming since June 24. Consisting of her 50 number-one songs on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs chart, the remix album highlighted &quot;how meaningful dance music has always been&quot; to Madonna&#x27;s career, and became her 23rd top-ten album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Throughout 2022 to 2023, Madonna released a number of stand-alone tracks, including &quot;Hung Up on Tokischa&quot; (a remix of &quot;Hung Up&quot;, featuring rapper Tokischa) and a 2015 demo recorded during the &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; sessions called &quot;Back That Up to the Beat&quot; to all digital outlets. She also collaborated on three songs on Christine and the Queens album &quot;Paranoïa, Angels, True Love&quot; (2023) and with The Weeknd and Playboi Carti on the single &quot;Popular&quot;, which was taken from the soundtrack to the drama series &quot;The Idol&quot;.
In January 2023, Madonna announced the Celebration Tour, her first greatest hits concert tour, which was set to run from July 2023 to January 2024. However, on June 24, 2023, the singer was hospitalized after being found unresponsive in her New York City apartment. She was admitted for five days and received treatment in the intensive care unit under intubation. Madonna later stated that she had been in a medically induced coma for 48 hours during her hospitalization for a &quot;serious bacterial infection&quot; following a low-grade fever. As a result, the initial North American leg of the tour was postponed.

The Celebration Tour finally began in October 2023, at the O2 Arena in London and garnered critical acclaim. It ended the following May with a free concert at Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro which was attended by 1.6 million people, making it the biggest standalone concert of all time. This tour grossed $225.4 million from 80 shows, making Madonna the first female artist to gross over $100 million with six different concert tours.

During these years, Madonna lost multiple family members, starting with her eldest brother Anthony dying in February 2023 at age 66. Her younger brother Christopher also died the following year on October 4, 2024, in Petoskey, Michigan at age 63 from pancreatic cancer, according to a statement from his family. He died just two weeks after the death of their stepmother Joan. Madonna dedicated a lengthy Instagram post to him saying, &quot;I admired him [...] We found our way back to each other. I did my best to keep him alive as long as possible. He was in so much pain towards the end [...] There will never be anyone like him&quot;.

=== 2024–present: Upcoming fifteenth studio album ===
Following the Celebration Tour, Madonna restarted work on her biographical film and later complained of producers wanting her to &quot;downsize-down scale-think smaller&quot; with regard to the project. She considered reworking it into a television series as a result. Madonna shifted her focus towards conceiving new music with Stuart Price, writing in December 2024 that &quot;these past few months has been medicine for my soul. Songwriting and making music is the one area where I don&#x27;t need to ask anyone for their permission. I&#x27;m so excited to share it with you&quot;. In February 2025, the singer revealed to be working on a sequel to her 2005 album &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot;, which Price also produced.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Madonna has called Nancy Sinatra one of her idols. She said Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; made a major impression on her. As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque, and loved Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Frédéric Chopin because she liked their &quot;feminine quality&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s major influences include Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, Patti Smith, Karen Carpenter, the Supremes, Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin and Led Zeppelin, as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. She also grew up listening to David Bowie, whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended. Another inspiration is American writer James Baldwin, whose quote &quot;artists are here to disturb the peace&quot; is frequently used by Madonna.

During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, &quot;I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny, and they were silly and sweet and they were girls and they were feminine and sexy. I just saw myself in them, my funniness and my need to boss people around and at the same time be taken care of. My girlishness. My knowingness and my innocence. Both.&quot; Her &quot;Material Girl&quot; music video recreated Monroe&#x27;s look in the song &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, from the film &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;. The video for &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang&#x27;s silent film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). The video for &quot;Vogue&quot; recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol.

Influences also came to her from the art world, such as through the works of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The music video of the song &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and Remedios Varo. Madonna is also a collector of Tamara de Lempicka&#x27;s Art Deco paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours. Her video for &quot;Hollywood&quot; (2003) was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin; Bourdin&#x27;s son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorized use of his father&#x27;s work. Pop artist Andy Warhol&#x27;s use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for &quot;Erotica&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;.

Madonna&#x27;s Catholic background has been reflected throughout her career, from her fashion use of rosary to her musical outputs, including on &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989). Her album &quot;MDNA&quot; (2012) has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing, and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center, a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through everyday life. In a 2016 interview, she commented: &quot;I always feel some kind of inexplicable connection with Catholicism. It kind of shows up in all of my work, as you may have noticed.&quot; Her study of the Kabbalah was also observed in Madonna&#x27;s music, especially albums like &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;. Speaking of religion in a 2019 interview with Harry Smith of &quot;Today&quot; Madonna stated, &quot;The God that I believe in, created the world ... He/Her/They [sic] isn&#x27;t a God to fear, it&#x27;s a God to give thanks to.&quot; In an appearance on &quot;Andrew Denton&#x27;s Interview&quot; she added, &quot;The idea that in any church you go, you see a man on a cross and everyone genuflects and prays to him ... in a way it&#x27;s paganism/idolatry because people are worshipping a thing.&quot;

=== Musical style and composition ===

Madonna&#x27;s music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of &quot;Contemporary Strategy Analysis&quot; (2005), commented that Madonna&#x27;s musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Thomas Harrison in the book &quot;Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties&quot; deemed Madonna &quot;an artist who pushed the boundaries&quot; of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically. Professor Santiago Fouz-Hernández asserted, &quot;While not gifted with an especially powerful or wide-ranging voice, Madonna has worked to expand her artistic palette to encompass diverse musical, textual and visual styles and various vocal guises, all with the intention of presenting herself as a mature musician.&quot;

Madonna has remained in charge in every aspect of her career, including as a writer and producer in most of her own music. Her desire for control had already been seen during the making of her debut album, where she fought Reggie Lucas over his production output. However, it was not until her third album that Warner allowed Madonna to produce her own album. Stan Hawkins, author of &quot;Settling the Pop Score&quot; explained, &quot;it is as musician and producer that Madonna is one of the few female artists to have broken into the male domain of the recording studio. Undoubtedly, Madonna is fully aware that women have been excluded from the musical workplace on most levels, and has set out to change this.&quot; Producer Stuart Price stated: &quot;You don&#x27;t produce Madonna, you collaborate with her... She has her vision and knows how to get it.&quot; Despite being labeled a &quot;control freak&quot;, Madonna has said that she valued input from her collaborators. She further explained:
Madonna&#x27;s early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. She subsequently became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including &quot;Lucky Star&quot; which she composed on synthesizer. As a songwriter, Madonna has registered more than 300 tracks to American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), including 18 songs written entirely by herself. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has named her &quot;an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.&quot; Despite having worked with producers across many genres, the magazine noted that Madonna&#x27;s compositions have been &quot;consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail.&quot; Patrick Leonard, who co-wrote many of her hit songs, called Madonna &quot;a helluva songwriter&quot;, explaining: &quot;Her sensibility about melodic line—from the beginning of the verse to the end of the verse and how the verse and the chorus influence each other—is very deep. Many times she&#x27;s singing notes that no one would&#x27;ve thought of but her.&quot; Barry Walters from &quot;Spin&quot; credited her songwriting as the reason of her musical consistency. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Madonna at number 56 on the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot; list.
Madonna&#x27;s discography is generally categorized as pop, electronica, and dance. Nevertheless, Madonna&#x27;s first foray into the music industry was dabbling in rock music with Breakfast Club and Emmy. As the frontwoman of Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12–14 songs that resemble the punk rock of that period. Madonna soon abandoned playing rock songs by the time she signed to Gotham Records, which eventually dropped her since they were unhappy with her new funk direction. According to Erlewine, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. Arie Kaplan in the book &quot;American Pop: Hit Makers, Superstars, and Dance Revolutionaries&quot; referred to Madonna as &quot;a pioneer&quot; of dance-pop. According to Fouz-Hernández, &quot;Madonna&#x27;s frequent use of dance idioms and subsequent association with gay or sexually liberated audiences, is seen as somehow inferior to &#x27;real&#x27; rock and roll. But Madonna&#x27;s music refuses to be defined by narrow boundaries of gender, sexuality or anything else.&quot;

The &quot;cold and emotional&quot; ballad &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, as well as its parent album &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986), is noted as Madonna&#x27;s first musical reinvention. &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Peter Piatkowski described it as a &quot;very deliberate effort to present Madonna as a mature and serious artist.&quot; She continued producing ballads in between her upbeat material, although albums such as &quot;Madonna&quot; (1983) and &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005) consist of entirely dance tracks. With &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998), critics acknowledged Madonna for bringing electronica from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene. Her other sonically drastic ventures include the 1930s big-band jazz on &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; (1990); lush R&amp;B on &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994); operatic show tunes on &quot;Evita&quot; (1996); guitar-driven folk music on &quot;American Life&quot; (2003); as well as multilingual world music on &quot;Madame X&quot; (2019).

=== Voice and instruments ===

Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice. Mark Bego, author of &quot;Madonna: Blonde Ambition&quot;, called her &quot;the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs&quot;, despite not being a &quot;heavyweight talent&quot;. According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC, &quot;Madonna&#x27;s vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs &#x27;straight&#x27;, but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.&quot; Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labeled her as &quot;Minnie Mouse on helium&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Evita&quot; (1996), Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, &quot;I studied with a vocal coach for &quot;Evita&quot; and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn&#x27;t using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it.&quot;

Besides singing, Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. Piano was the first instrument taught to her as a child. In the late 1970s, she learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy, before joining the Breakfast Club lineup as the drummer. She later played guitar with the band Emmy as well as on her own demo recordings. After her career breakthrough, Madonna was absent performing with guitar for years, but she is credited for playing cowbell on &quot;Madonna&quot; (1983) and synthesizer on &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film &quot;Music of the Heart&quot;, but she eventually left the project before filming began. Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of &quot;Music&quot; (2000) and recruited guitarist Monte Pittman to help improve her skill. Since then, Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums. She received a nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award at the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards.

=== Music videos and performances ===

In &quot;The Madonna Companion&quot;, biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work more than any other recent pop artist. According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book &quot;Nots&quot; (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is the video and the reigning &quot;queen of video&quot; is Madonna. He further asserted that &quot;the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna&#x27;s excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory.&quot; The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, or &quot;Justify My Love&quot; had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves. Morton felt that &quot;artistically, Madonna&#x27;s songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos.&quot; In 2003, MTV named her &quot;The Greatest Music Video Star Ever&quot; and said that &quot;Madonna&#x27;s innovation, creativity, and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her atop the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time.

Madonna&#x27;s initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamour. She was able to transmit her avant-garde Downtown Manhattan fashion sense to the American audience. The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the &quot;True Blue&quot; era. Author Douglas Kellner noted, &quot;such &#x27;multiculturalism&#x27; and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences.&quot; Madonna&#x27;s Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a black saint statue, and singing in front of burning crosses.

Madonna&#x27;s acting performances in films have frequently received poor reviews from film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in &quot;Time&quot; that, &quot;[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it&#x27;s tough to watch because she&#x27;s clearly trying her damnedest.&quot; According to biographer Andrew Morton, &quot;Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt.&quot; After the critically panned box-office bomb &quot;Swept Away&quot; (2002), Madonna vowed never to act again in a film. While reviewing her career retrospective titled &quot;Body of Work&quot; (2016) at New York&#x27;s Metrograph hall, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Nigel M. Smith wrote that Madonna&#x27;s film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her, and she otherwise &quot;could steal a scene for all the right reasons&quot;.

Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactments of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna&#x27;s videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the original videos&#x27; realism. She believed that &quot;her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized&quot;. Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna&#x27;s concerts and live performances are &quot;extravagant show piece[s], [and] walking art show[s].&quot;

Chris Nelson from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.&quot; Thor Christensen of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by &quot;stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.&quot; To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the &quot;Madonna mic&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Madonna has built a legacy that transcends music and has been studied by sociologists, historians, and other scholars, contributing to the rise of Madonna studies, a subfield of American cultural studies. According to Rodrigo Fresán, &quot;saying that Madonna is just a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda. Madonna is one of the classic symbols of Made in USA.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone Spain&quot; wrote, &quot;She became the first master of viral pop in history, years before the internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, &#x27;radio formulas&#x27;, magazine covers and even in bookstores. A pop dialectic, never seen since the Beatles&#x27;s reign, which allowed her to keep on the edge of trend and commerciality.&quot; William Langley from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; felt that &quot;Madonna has changed the world&#x27;s social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to.&quot; Professor Diane Pecknold noted that &quot;nearly any poll of the biggest, greatest, or best in popular culture includes [Madonna&#x27;s] name&quot;. In 2012, VH1 ranked Madonna as the greatest woman in music.
&quot;Spin&quot; writer Bianca Gracie stated that &quot;the &#x27;Queen of Pop&#x27; isn&#x27;t enough to describe Madonna—she is Pop. [She] formulated the blueprint of what a pop star should be.&quot; Madonna became the first act to be crowned the Greatest Pop Star twice by &quot;Billboard&quot; (1985 and 1989). According to Sclafani, &quot;It&#x27;s worth noting that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her, almost all would be female singers ... When the Beatles hit America, they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with an emphasis on the female.&quot; Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, asserted that &quot;Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... She certainly raised the standards of all of them ... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers.&quot; Andy Bennett and Steve Waksman, authors of &quot;The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music&quot; (2014), noted that &quot;almost all female pop stars of recent years—Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and others—acknowledge the important influence of Madonna on their own careers.&quot; Madonna has also influenced male artists, inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians.

Madonna&#x27;s use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that she had &quot;started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style, and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.&quot; Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one&#x27;s social relations. In &quot;Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture&quot; (2009), the authors noted that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, can unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman&#x27;s occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women. Professor Sut Jhally has referred to her as &quot;an almost sacred feminist icon&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Matt Cain stated that Madonna has &quot;broke[n] down social barriers&quot; and brought marginalized groups to the forefront, by frequently featuring LGBT, Latino, and black culture in her works. An author said that &quot;by making culture generally available, Madonna becomes the culture of all social classes&quot;. Canadian professor Karlene Faith gave her point of view saying that Madonna&#x27;s peculiarity is that &quot;she has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains&quot; and she &quot;has been a &#x27;cult figure&#x27; within self-propelling subcultures just as she became a major.&quot; GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis stated that Madonna &quot;always has and always will be the LGBTQ community&#x27;s greatest ally&quot;, while &quot;The Advocate&quot; dubbed her as &quot;the greatest gay icon&quot;. Madonna herself stated in 2024, &quot;Aside from my birthday, New York Pride is the most important day of the year.&quot;

Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen, &quot;achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry&quot;, and generating over $1.2 billion in sales within the first decade of her career. According to Gini Gorlinski in the book &quot;The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time&quot; (2010), Madonna&#x27;s levels of power and control were &quot;unprecedented&quot; for a woman in the entertainment industry. London Business School academics called her a &quot;dynamic entrepreneur&quot; worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that &quot;Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won&#x27;t stop until she gets what she wants—and that&#x27;s something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her.&quot;

== Achievements ==

&quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Madonna&#x27;s net worth at $850 million as of 2024, making her one of the wealthiest musicians in the world. She became &quot;Forbes&quot;″s annual highest-paid female musician 11 times across the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. She is recognized as the best-selling female music artist of all time by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, and has a total of 18 albums certified multi-platinum in multiple countries. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the third highest-certified female artist in the United States, with 65.5 million certified album-equivalent units. In Japan, the world&#x27;s second largest market, Madonna has received 17 Gold Disc Awards from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), including the most Artist of the Year wins by a solo artist (five).

Madonna had generated over US$1.6 billion from ticket sales of her concert tours throughout her career, Madonna was the highest-grossing female touring artist, before being overtaken by Taylor Swift in 2023, according to &quot;Pollstar&quot;. Her biggest solo concerts by paying attendance include her Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour&#x27;s concert in Parc de Sceaux, Paris (130,000 audience) and her Girlie Show&#x27;s concert in Maracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro (120,000 audience). The closing performance of The Celebration Tour, in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, on May 5, 2024, drew over 1.6 million people, becoming the largest audience for a stand-alone concert by any artist. She has also won seven Grammy Awards and twenty MTV Video Music Awards, including the 1986 Video Vanguard Award for which she became the first female recipient.

From &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984) to &quot;Give Me All Your Luvin&#x27;&quot; (2012), a total of 44 Madonna singles have topped the official chart in at least one of the world&#x27;s top-ten music markets, including the United States (12), the United Kingdom (13), Canada (24), Australia (11), Italy (23), and Spain (21). At the 40th anniversary of the GfK Media Control Charts, Madonna was ranked as the most successful singles artist in German chart history.

<text>The Homebrew Computer Club was an early computer hobbyist group in Menlo Park, California, which met from March 1975 to December 1986. The club had an influential role in the development of the microcomputer revolution and the rise of that aspect of the Silicon Valley information technology industrial complex.

Several high-profile hackers and computer entrepreneurs emerged from its ranks, including Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the founders of Apple Computer. With its newsletter and monthly meetings promoting an open exchange of ideas, the club has been described as &quot;the crucible for an entire industry&quot; as it pertains to personal computing.

==History==

The Homebrew Computer Club was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, circuits, and information pertaining to DIY construction of personal computing devices. It was started by Gordon French and Fred Moore who met at the Community Computer Center in Menlo Park. They both were interested in maintaining a regular, open forum for people to get together to work on making computers more accessible to everyone.

The first meeting of the club was held on March 5, 1975, in French&#x27;s garage in Menlo Park, San Mateo County, California, on the occasion of the arrival in the area of the first Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer, a unit sent for review by People&#x27;s Computer Company. Steve Wozniak credits that first meeting as the inspiration to design the Apple I. The second meeting was held at Peninsula School in Menlo Park, California. Subsequent meetings were held at an auditorium at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), until 1978, when meetings moved to the Stanford Medical School.

An anecdote from member Thomas &quot;Todd&quot; Fischer relates that after the more-or-less &quot;formal&quot; meetings the participants often reconvened for an informal, late night &quot;swap meet&quot; in the parking lot of the Safeway store down the road, as SLAC campus rules prohibited such activity on campus property. Others, at the suggestion of Roger Melen, convened at The Oasis, a bar and grill they considered a pub located on El Camino Real in nearby Menlo Park, recalled years later by a member as &quot;Homebrew&#x27;s other staging area&quot;. As Steven Levy wrote about the Oasis gatherings:

The Oasis closed on March 7, 2018, due to unaffordable rent. Its Menlo Park building is a historical landmark; in 2019 the building became home to a venture capital firm, Pear VC.

The 1999 made-for-television movie &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; (and the book on which it is based, &quot;Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer&quot;) describes the role the Homebrew Computer Club played in creating the first personal computers, although the movie took the liberty of placing the meeting in Berkeley and misrepresented the meeting process.

Many of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club continue to meet (), having formed the 6800 Club, named after the Motorola (now Freescale) 6800 microprocessor. Occasionally and variously renamed after the release of the 6800, 6809, and other microprocessors, the group continues to meet monthly in Cupertino, California.

==Members==

Most of the members were hobbyists but had an electronic engineering or computer programming background. They came to the meetings to talk about the Altair 8800, to review other technical topics, and to exchange schematics and programming tips.

From the ranks of this club came the founders of many microcomputer companies, including Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (Apple Computer), Harry Garland and Roger Melen (Cromemco), Thomas &quot;Todd&quot; Fischer (IMSAI Division, Fischer-Freitas Company), George Morrow (Morrow Designs), Paul Terrell (Byte Shop), Adam Osborne (Osborne Computer), and Bob Marsh (Processor Technology). John Draper was a member of the club, as was Jerry Lawson (creator of the first cartridge-based video game system, Fairchild Channel F). 

Li-Chen Wang, developer of Palo Alto Tiny Basic and graphics software for the Cromemco Dazzler, was a club member, and Lee Felsenstein was moderator of the club meetings. Steve Inness was a primary designer of one of the early cell phone touch screens as well as a business partner with John Draper. Liza Loop was an early member and the first woman to join.

Others went on to other pursuits, such as Dan Werthimer, who is a researcher in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

==Newsletter==

The Homebrew Computer Club&#x27;s newsletter was one of the most influential forces in the formation of the culture of Silicon Valley. Created and edited by its members, it initiated the idea of the personal computer, and helped its members build the original kit computers, like the Altair. One such influential event was the publication of Bill Gates&#x27;s &quot;Open Letter to Hobbyists&quot;, which lambasted the early hackers of the time for violating the copyrights of commercial software programs.

Paul Terrell, partner in Repco who was the exclusive sales rep company for MITS in Northern California, was a member of the club and would provide information at the meetings about the progress of the Altair 8800 in the factory and provide copies of the MITS Newsletter to members. He later started Byte Shop, an affordable computer store in Mountain View, California, and bought the first 50 Apple I Computers from Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak after they did a demonstration of the Apple I at a meeting at SLAC.

The first issue of the newsletter was published on March 15, 1975, and continued through several designs, ending after 21 issues in December 1977. The newsletter was published from a variety of addresses in the early days, but later submissions went to a P.O. box address in Mountain View, California.

The second volume began on January 31, 1976, and included sections for A LETTER FROM MITS, CASSETTE UPDATE, TINY BASIC, MEETING FACILITIES, SOFTWARE, PROBLEMS, MEETING-1, and ALTAIR 680.

==In popular culture==
The club is depicted in the films &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; (1999) and &quot;Jobs&quot; (2013), as well as in the PBS documentary series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; (1996). However, the depiction of how the club worked was not entirely accurate.

<text>In Christian art, a Madonna () is a religious depiction of the Blessed Virgin Mary in a singular form or sometimes accompanied by the Child Jesus. These images are central icons for both the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches. The word is (archaic). The Madonna and Child type is very prevalent in Christian iconography, divided into many traditional subtypes especially in Eastern Orthodox iconography, often known after the location of a notable icon of the type, such as the &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot;, &quot;Agiosoritissa&quot;, &quot;Blachernitissa&quot;, etc., or descriptive of the depicted posture, as in &quot;Hodegetria&quot;, &quot;Eleusa&quot;, etc.

The term &quot;Madonna&quot; in the sense of &quot;picture or statue of the Virgin Mary&quot; enters English usage in the 17th century, primarily in reference to works of the Italian Renaissance. In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as &quot;Theotokos&quot;. &quot;Madonna&quot; may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, where she is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery that have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the Life of the Virgin, e.g. the Annunciation to Mary, are not typically called &quot;Madonna&quot;.

The earliest depictions of Mary date to Early Christian art of the (2nd to 3rd centuries, found in the Catacombs of Rome. These are in a narrative context. The classical &quot;Madonna&quot; or &quot;Theotokos&quot; imagery develops from the 5th century, as Marian devotion rose to great importance after the Council of Ephesus formally affirmed her status as &quot;Mother of God or &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&quot;God-bearer&quot;) in 431. The &quot;Theotokos&quot; iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres.

According to a tradition first recorded in the 8th century, and still strong in the Eastern Church, the iconography of images of Mary goes back to a portrait drawn from life by Luke the Evangelist, with a number of icons (such as the &quot;Panagia Portaitissa&quot;) claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as Duccio, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, Caravaggio, and Rubens (and further by certain modernists such as Salvador Dalí and Henry Moore), while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.

== Terminology ==
Liturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the &quot;Akathist&quot;) was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of Δεσποινα (&quot;Despoina&quot;) was adopted as Latin &quot;Domina&quot; &quot;Lady&quot;. The medieval Italian &quot;Ma Donna&quot; (&quot;My Lady&quot;) reflects &quot;Mea Domina&quot;, while &quot;Nostra Domina&quot; (δεσποινίς ἡμῶν) was adopted in French, as &quot;Nostre Dame&quot; &quot;Our Lady&quot;.

These names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially, with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned, such as the Ognissanti Madonna. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty. Ultramarine was usually reserved for only the most important commissions, such as the blue robes of the Virgin Mary in Gérard David&#x27;s Virgin and Child with Female Saints.

While the Italian term &quot;Madonna&quot; paralleled English &quot;Our Lady&quot; in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an art historical term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the Italian Renaissance. In this sense, &quot;a Madonna&quot;, or &quot;a Madonna with Child&quot; is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A &quot;Madonna&quot; may alternatively be called &quot;Virgin&quot; or &quot;Our Lady&quot;, but &quot;Madonna&quot; is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot; may in English be called &quot;Our Lady of Vladimir&quot;, while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the &quot;Madonna of Vladimir&quot;.

== Modes of representation ==
There are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.
* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal mosaics.
* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the Hodegetria was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the Sistine Madonna by Raphael.
* The &quot;Madonna enthroned&quot; is a type of image that dates from the Byzantine period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the Madonna and Child often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a Sacra conversazione.
* The Madonna of humility refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child Jesus in her lap. This style was a product of Franciscan piety, and perhaps due to Simone Martini. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany. It was the most popular among the styles of the early Trecento artistic period.
* Half-length Madonnas are the form most frequently taken by painted icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the subject matter is highly formulated so that each painting expresses one particular attribute of the &quot;Mother of God&quot;. Half-length paintings of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; are also common in Italian Renaissance painting, particularly in Venice.
* The seated &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in Florence and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the Passion of Christ.
* The &quot;Adoring Madonna&quot; is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint. Examples include, Madonna Adoring the Sleeping Christ Child and Madonna Adoring the Child with Five Angels (Botticelli).
* The Nursing Madonna, Virgo Lactans, or Madonna Lactans, is an iconography of the Madonna and Child in which the Virgin Mary is shown breastfeeding the infant Jesus. Examples include Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Madonna Litta.
* The iconography of the Woman of the Apocalypse is applied to Marian portraiture in a variety of ways over time, depending on the interpretation of the relevant Biblical passage.
* Hodegetria, or Virgin Hodegetria, is an iconographic depiction of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) holding the Child Jesus at her side while pointing to him as the source of salvation for humankind. In the Western Church this type of icon is sometimes called &quot;Our Lady of the Way&quot;.
* Eleusa icon, the Eleusa (or Eleousa; – &quot;tenderness&quot; or &quot;showing mercy&quot;) is a type of depiction of the Virgin Mary in icons in which the Christ Child is nestled against her cheek. In the Western Church the type is often known as the &quot;Virgin of Tenderness&quot;.
* The Rest on the Flight into Egypt is a subject in Christian art showing Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus resting during their flight into Egypt. The Holy Family is normally shown in a landscape. Examples include Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio), and they often depict &quot;Virgo Lactans&quot;.
* The term Black Madonna or Black Virgin tends to refer to statues or paintings in Western Christendom of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus, where both figures are depicted as black. The Black Madonna can be found both in Catholic and Orthodox countries, and may or may not be related to liberation theology.
*Mary in Islam, as Maryam (Mary) is one of the most honored figures in Islamic theology she is exempt from aniconism in Islam.
*Girlhood of Mary, is iconography that features the Virgin Mary as a child, often learning needlework, and examples include The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, by artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, which is of note that Mary is the obvious central figure.
*the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary, is iconography showing the announcement by the angel Gabriel to Mary that she would conceive and bear a son through a virgin birth. Examples include Ecce Ancilla Domini.
*Death of the Virgin, Assumption of the Virgin Mary in art, Coronation of the Virgin although doctrine avoids stating whether Mary was alive or dead when she was bodily taken up to Heaven, she is normally shown in art as alive. Depicting the Coronation of Mary as Queen of the Heavens by her son, Jesus Christ, sometimes combined with the Assumption of Mary, is a tradition known since the 12th century. They often depict birds, as an appropriate image of God as the Holy Spirit.
*Holy Family is iconography of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus. The example Holy Family with Saints Anne and John the Baptist (Mantegna) portrays their Presentation of Jesus at the Temple and includes other Saints in the image.
* Marian apparition the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the venerated icon has a sunburst of straight and wavy gold rays alternate while projecting behind the Virgin and are enclosed within a mandorla.

==History==

The earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the Catacomb of Priscilla, Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.

The earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an iconoclastic strain in culture that rejected physical representations as &quot;idols&quot;, respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as icons (Greek &quot;image&quot;). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, Pope Agapetus was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the &quot;theotokos&quot; and to the portrayal of her image in churches. Eastern examples show the Madonna enthroned, even wearing the closed Byzantine pearl-encrusted crown with pendants, with the Christ Child on her lap.

In the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the Virgin Mary sits with the Infant Jesus on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby John the Baptist looks on. The socalled &quot;Madonna della seggiola&quot; shows both of them: the Virgin embraces the infant Jesus, near John the Baptist.

Late Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. Iconography varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin suckling the Child (such as the &quot;Madonna Litta&quot;) is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.

===Early images===
There was a great expansion of the cult of Mary after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as Theotokos (&quot;God-bearer&quot;) was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with arguments over the nature of Christ. In mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, dating from 432 to 440, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a halo, and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the Adoration of the Magi.

By the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in Egypt. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the Magnificat, her humility and her above other humans, and has the Hand of God above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome, datable to 705–707 by the kneeling figure of Pope John VII, a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand. This type was long confined to Rome. The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th–8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; &quot;isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe&quot;.

At this period the iconography of the Nativity was taking the form, centred on Mary, that it has retained up to the present day in Eastern Orthodoxy, and on which Western depictions remained based until the High Middle Ages. Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; were being evolved, relying on apocyphal sources to fill in her life before the Annunciation to Mary. By this time the political and economic collapse of the Western Roman Empire meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated iconography, and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.

The earliest surviving image in a Western illuminated manuscript of the Madonna and Child comes from the Book of Kells of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of Insular art, the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period. This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a Gospel book, and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the book of hours was devised in the 13th century.

The &quot;Madonna of humility&quot; by Domenico di Bartolo, 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early Renaissance.

===Byzantine influence on the West===
Very few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Byzantium (324–1453) saw itself as the true Rome, if Greek-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in Crusades at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures. Later in the Middle Ages, the Cretan school was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.

While theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated. Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself. Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and luxurious textiles were distributed throughout the West. In Byzantium, Mary&#x27;s usual title was the Theotokos or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that salvation was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God&#x27;s incarnation. That theological concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.

However, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold. First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West. One is a valued possession of Santa Maria in Trastevere, one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the Pantheon, that great architectural wonder of the Ancient Roman Empire, that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church&#x27;s triumph. Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in tempera (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels. In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons. Second, they share iconography, or subject matter. Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son. It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.

===Later medieval period===
It was not until the revival of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her. Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion. Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real gold leaf in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval goldsmiths used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles. Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with lapis lazuli, a stone imported from Afghanistan.

This is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function. Often referred to as the &quot;Rucellai Madonna&quot; (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image. Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town. Known as the &quot;Maesta&quot; (1308–1311), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints. In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London. This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.

The privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.

Despite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire. Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment. This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil. She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing. Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or conduit for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna&#x27;s complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.

While the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings. She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West. She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture. As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto&#x27;s narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family&#x27;s palace in Padua. This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.

Italian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.

===Renaissance===
While the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers. Most works of art from this era are sacred. While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.

Some of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giorgione, Giovanni Bellini and Titian. They developed on the foundations of 15th-century Marian images by Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, Mantegna and Piero della Francesca in particular, among countless others. The subject was equally popular in Early Netherlandish painting and that of the rest of Northern Europe.

The subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the Annunciation, and later the Immaculate Conception, led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son. As a commemorative image, the &quot;Pietà&quot; became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son Christ. The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.

===Modern images===
In some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.

In Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a &quot;Hausmadonna&quot;. Some date back to the Middle Ages, while some are still being made today. Usually found on the level of the second floor or higher, and often on the corner of a house, such sculptures were found in great numbers in many cities; Mainz, for instance, was supposed to have had more than 200 of them before World War II. The variety in such statues is as great as in other Madonna images; one finds Madonnas holding grapes (in reference to the &quot;Song of Songs&quot; 1:14, translated as &quot;My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms&quot; in the NIV), &quot;immaculate&quot; Madonnas in pure, perfect white without child or accessories, and Madonnas with roses symbolizing her life determined by the mysteries of faith.

In Italy, the &quot;roadside Madonna&quot; is a common sight both on the side of buildings and along roads in small enclosures. These are expected to bring spiritual relief to people who pass them. Some Madonnas statues are placed around Italian towns and villages as a matter of protection, or as a commemoration of a reported miracle.

In the 1920s, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed statues called the &quot;Madonna of the Trail&quot; from coast to coast, marking the path of the old National Road and the Santa Fe Trail.

Throughout his life, the painter Ray Martìn Abeyta created works inspired by the Cusco School style of Madonna painting, creating a hybrid of traditional and contemporary Latino subject matter representing the colonialist encounters between Europeans and Mesoamericans.

In 2015 iconographer Mark Dukes created the icon Our Lady of Ferguson, depicting the Madonna and child, in relation to the Shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

The first important encounter between Islam and the image of the Madonna is said to have happened during the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s conquest of Mecca. At the culmination of his mission, in 629 CE, Muhammad conquered Mecca with a Muslim army, with his first action being the &quot;cleansing&quot; or &quot;purifying&quot; of the Kaaba, wherein he removed all the pre-Islamic pagan images and idols from inside the temple. According to reports collected by Ibn Ishaq and al-Azraqi, Muhammad did, however, protectively put his hand over a painting of Mary and Jesus, and a fresco of Abraham in order to keep them from being effaced. In the words of the historian Barnaby Rogerson, &quot;Muhammad raised his hand to protect an icon of the Virgin and Child and a painting of Abraham, but otherwise his companions cleared the interior of its clutter of votive treasures, cult implements, statuettes and hanging charms.&quot;

The Islamic scholar Martin Lings narrated the event thus in his : &quot;Christians sometimes came to do honour to the Sanctuary of Abraham, and they were made welcome like all the rest. Moreover one Christian had been allowed and even encouraged to paint an icon of the Virgin Mary and the child Christ on an inside wall of the Ka&#x27;bah, where it sharply contrasted with all the other paintings. But Quraysh were more or less insensitive to this contrast: for them it was simply a question of increasing the multitude of idols by another two; and it was partly their tolerance that made them so impenetrable... Apart from the icon of the Virgin Mary and the child Jesus, and a painting of an old man, said to be Abraham, the walls inside had been covered with pictures of pagan deities. Placing his hand protectively over the icon, the Prophet told Uthman to see that all the other paintings, except that of Abraham, were effaced.&quot;

== Parallels in Indian art ==

In Indian art there are striking similarities found in between the images of Madonna and Christ Child, and Yashoda or Devaki and Krishna, as both the Hindu and the Christian figures of the &quot;eternal child&quot; are shown cuddled warmly on the laps of their mother.

There also exists a temple in Goa, the Shree Devakikrishna Temple at Marcel, where seeing the idol of Krishna-Devaki, the Portuguese had not decimated the temple, for it had reminded them of Virgin Mary-Jesus.

&quot;An impressive idol of Devaki, carrying the infant lord on her waist, stands at the inner sanctum of the temple. The image is unusual because while there exists a plethora of temples in the country dedicated to Krishna, there is no image of Devaki&quot;. Historian Anant Dhume, in his book &#x27;The Cultural History of Goa from 10,000 BC to 1352 AD&#x27;, compares the idol with the image of Madonna and the Christ child because of the similarities.

In the book, Dhume elaborates: &quot;However, the idol of Devkikrishna originally of Chodan Island, Tiswadi taluka transferred at the time of molestation by the Christian missionaries to Mashela (Marcela in Portuguese) hamlet of Orgaon village, Ponda taluka, is interesting ... History says that Vasco da Gama in his old age was appointed Vice-Roy of all colonies of the Far East as a gesture of honour. One day, he visited Chodan Island. When he saw this idol through the main doorway, he immediately saluted the image and went on his knees, considering it the image of Mother Mary, with baby Jesus ...&quot;

During the Portuguese reign in Goa starting from the 16th Century, the Indo-Portuguese ivory statuettes made, reflected such similarities. &quot;The Portuguese had settled with the aim to dominate the spice trade and spread their Christian faith, and these small, portable ivory statues would embellish the church altars and Goan homes, and were also transported abroad serving to fulfil their later project. These figurines were carved by the Indian artists under the guidance of the Jesuits&quot;. Art historian Gauvin Alexander Bailey notes that the Jesuit art commissions &quot;were . . . a partnership in which the artists&#x27; own interpretations of sacred art were encouraged and fostered.&quot; The Jesuits sourced small paintings, prints and sculptures from Europe for the Indian sculptors to use as reference, and the indigenous artists used their own traditions for fashioning such figures. One of the most brilliant example of this syncretic form is the figure called the Good Shepherd Rockery (also known as the Good Shepherd Mount or Bom Pastor) which &quot;displays the coming together of cultures in both its iconography and its features, encapsulating how Goan sculptors created images of the divine that are Catholic, European, and South Asian&quot;. The child form of Christ in this figure, with round face and smooth skin were perhaps drawn from sculptures of baby Krishna.

Whereas, in Bengal, the Chore Bagan Art Studio, the Kansaripara Art Studio and the Calcutta Art Studio, produced homegrown prints around the second half of the nineteenth century. These artists, were influenced by the various depictions of Christ in the European prints which had infiltrated the market of the time. And perhaps the closest connection they could draw was between the child Christ and Krishna. Jyotindra Jain comments: &quot;... the Chore Bagan Art Studio published a popular picture, titled Birth Of Krishna, which was almost entirely based on popular prints of The Birth Of Jesus Christ, to the extent that the presence of three wise men of the East was also literally imitated in this work.&quot;

Artists such as Jamini Roy also adopted this image, and Jesus and Mary would feature in the canvases of Tyeb Mehta, Krishnen Khanna, Madhvi Parekh and others in ways that provide a commentary on, and glimpse of the Indian social scene. Churches in India, such as Tamil Nadu&#x27;s Sanctuary of Our Lady of Vailankanni which was deemed a basilica by the Roman Catholic Church in 1962, similarly housed idols of Mary clad in a traditional saree. &quot;These remain examples of how in art and in faith traditions merge, so do symbols and images, giving birth to syncretic cultures that testify the ravages of communal hate, man-made differences and orthodox interpretations&quot;. Nirendranath Chakraborty, one of the finest modern poets of Bengal wrote, taking forward this imagery of the mother and the child, wrote a famous poem entitled &quot;Kolkatar Jishu&quot; (The Jesus of Calcutta).

The everlasting tenderness of the mother-child figure, of motherhood and the unconditional bond of love and warmth that this relationship holds, &quot;that the Christ child on Madonna&#x27;s lap signifies and is reverberated in the image of Krishna-Yashoda or Devaki, is perhaps what marks the culture of love&quot;, and justifies the various interpretations of this symbol in art and poetry found across the subcontinent.

==Notable types and individual works==
There are a large number of articles on individual works of various sorts in :Category:Virgin Mary in art and its sub-category. See also the incomplete List of depictions of the Virgin and Child. The term &quot;Madonna&quot; is often applied to representations of Mary that were not created by Italians. A small selection of examples include:
*&quot;Golden Madonna of Essen&quot;, the earliest large-scale sculptural example in Western Europe and a precedent for the polychrome wooden processional sculptures of Romanesque France, a type known as Throne of Wisdom
*&quot;Madonna of humility&quot;, depicting a Madonna sitting on the ground, or low cushions
*&quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, a painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, from around the year 1300
*&quot;The Black Madonna of Częstochowa&quot; (&quot;Czarna Madonna&quot; or &quot;Matka Boska Częstochowska&quot; in Polish) icon, which was, according to legend, painted by St. Luke the Evangelist on a cypress table top from the house of the Holy Family
*&quot;Madonna and Child with Flowers&quot;, possibly one of two works begun by Leonardo da Vinci
*&quot;Madonna Eleusa&quot; (of tenderness) has been depicted both in the Eastern and Western churches.
*&quot;Madonna of the Steps&quot;, a relief by Michelangelo
*&quot;Madonna della seggiola&quot;, by Raphael
*&quot;Madonna with the Long Neck&quot;, by Parmigianino
*&quot;The Madonna of Port Lligat&quot;, the name of two paintings by Salvador Dalí created in 1949 and 1950

<text>The Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park (&quot;Nationalpark Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft&quot;) is Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&#x27;s largest national park, situated at the coast of the Baltic Sea. It consists of several peninsulas, islands and lagoon shore areas in the Baltic Sea, belonging to the district of Vorpommern-Rügen.

The national park includes:

* the Darß peninsula
* the western coast of the island of Rügen
* the island of Hiddensee
* the island of Ummanz
* several tiny islets between the above places
* the multiple lagoons in between the land masses

The national park is characterised by very shallow water housing a unique coastal fauna. All portions of the national park are famous for being a resting place for tens of thousands of cranes and geese.

Its area is .

== Composition ==
Approximately half the area of the park is open Baltic Sea; more than another quarter covers parts of the lagoons in the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain including the West Rügen Bodden. Thus it protects these shallow water areas (in the Baltic Sea, the National Park boundary is based on the ten-metre depth contour) with their rich flora and fauna. The differing salt content of the brackish water habitats of the Baltic and the &quot;bodden&quot; (shallow lagoons) contribute significantly to the local diversity of nature. For example, the Baltic Herring visits the shallow bays regularly to spawn here.

The territory of the national park includes parts of the Darß and the peninsula of Zingst as well as most of the island of Hiddensee. In addition, a narrow strip of land on the island of Rügen, next to the &quot;bodden&quot; lies within the national park. Pine and beech woods, such as the Darß Forest, cover much of the land. In treeless areas there are bogs, resulting from coastal flooding.

<text>Nordvorpommern (&quot;North Western Pomerania&quot;) was a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northern part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It was situated at the coast of the Baltic Sea, where it enclosed the city of Stralsund. Further to the northeast, separated from Stralsund and Nordvorpommern by the Strelasund, lies the island of Rügen, administratively part of the eponymous district. Other neighboring districts are (from east clockwise) Ostvorpommern, Demmin, Güstrow and Bad Doberan.

==Geography==
The coast is characterised by an elongated peninsula, the Darß. Between the Darß and the mainland there is a very shallow lagoon, which is a part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park, just as the entire peninsula itself.

==History==
In history this region was the westernmost part of Pomerania. Until 1819 it was a Swedish, after that Prussian territory called Neuvorpommern.

Nordvorpommern District was established in 1994 by merging the three previous districts of Grimmen, Ribnitz-Damgarten and Stralsund. On 4 September 2011, it was merged into Vorpommern-Rügen.

<text>The Darß or Darss is the middle part of the peninsula of Fischland-Darß-Zingst on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The peninsula&#x27;s name is of Slavic origin. There is a large forest in the Darß. In recent times, the name &quot;Darß&quot; has also been used to refer to the entire peninsula.

The Darß is famous for being a resting place for tens of thousands of migrating cranes and geese. Tourism has long been a source of income and has increased since German reunification, but the Darß is still far from being a crowded tourist place.

== Location and character ==

The Darß lies northeast of Fischland and west of the peninsula of Zingst, its boundary with the latter being formed by the inlet of the Prerower Strom. To the north lies the Baltic Sea; to the south the lagoons of Saaler Bodden and Bodstedter Bodden, which belong to the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain. The Darß measures between from north to south and from east to west and is home to the villages of Born a. Darß, Prerow and Wieck. The village of Ahrenshoop in the municipality of Ahrenshoop belongs to Vordarß, whilst the southern villages in Ahrenshoop, Althagen and Niehagen, are part of Fischland.

Most of the Darß is covered by the woodland of the Darß Forest, in area. On the northern tip of the Darß, at Darßer Ort, is a lighthouse of the same name. The National Park exhibition in Wieck a. Darß provides information about the geological development as well as the flora and fauna of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park, as does the Natureum in Wieck a. Darß attached to the Darßer Ort Lighthouse, as outstations of the German Oceanographic Museum in Stralsund. Darßer Ort is an extended chain of sandbanks running in a northeasterly direction. The entire area around Darßer Ort as well as the northwestern part of the Darß Forest is part of Protection Zone I of the National Park and may only be visited on marked paths. The rest of the forested region is also part of the National Park.

<text>The IBM Electric were an early series of electric typewriters that IBM manufactured, starting in the mid-1930s. They used the conventional moving carriage and typebar mechanism, as opposed to the fixed carriage and type ball used in the IBM Selectric, introduced in 1961. After 1944, each model came in both &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Executive&quot; versions, the latter featuring proportional spacing.

==History==
The IBM Electromatic typewriter was the first electric typewriter to enjoy long-term commercial success. Unlike the later IBM Selectric typewriter, this typewriter model used a conventional moving carriage and typebar mechanism.

The history of the Electromatic goes back to 1924, when the North East Electric Company received patent rights for the power roller from James Smathers. At that time, the company was selling electric motors, and wanted to get into the typewriter business. They reached an arrangement with Remington, securing a contract for 2,500 machines in 1925. N. E. Electric manufactured the motor and power-roller base. The typewriter portion was made by Remington, based on its model Number 12. Remington had to do little more than attach its typewriter to the base.

All the units manufactured sold quickly and Remington wanted to continue the relationship. According to Darryl Rehr, in his 1997 book, &quot;Antique Typewriters &amp; Office Collectibles&quot;, Remington claimed ... they could sell as many as N.E. Electric could produce.&quot; The insistence of N.E. Electric on a contract, however, came at a time when Remington was unable to make such a commitment, so the Remington Electric went out of production.

The N. E. Electric Company then developed and produced the Electromatic, placing it on the market in 1929. After passing through the hands of General Motors, it became The Electromatic Typewriter Co. 

IBM acquired the assets of Electromatic Typewriters, Inc., of Rochester, N.Y. in 1933 and invested $1 million in redesigning their product and setting up service centers. The new IBM&#x27;s Model 01 was introduced in 1935 and became the first successful electric typewriter in the U.S., according to IBM. Major model introductions included:

In the 1950s, modified standard versions of the A, B, and C models were used as console typewriters or terminals on many early computers (e.g., JOHNNIAC, IBM 1620, PDP-1). The IBM Selectric typewriter, introduced in 1961, was easier to interface to a computer and was favored in new designs, such as the IBM 1130 computer and the IBM 1050 terminal.

==Executive==

IBM announced proportional letter spacing for typewriters in 1941, but IBM&#x27;s World War II effort delayed the introduction of a typewriter model, the Executive, with this capability until 1944. Standard typewriters have a fixed letter pitch, so, for example the letter &quot;i&quot; occupies the same space as the letter &quot;m&quot;. The Executive model differed in having a multiple escapement mechanism and four widths for characters, allowing it to simulate 12 point &#x27;ragged right&#x27; typesetting. A skilled typist, by carefully counting letters on each line, could even produce fully justified layouts on the Executive.

According to Darren Wershler-Henry:

In 1944, IBM launched the Executive, a proportionally spaced typewriter. Characters on the Executive typewriter occupied between two and five units per grid cell, depending on the width of the letter. Beeching relates an anecdote that demonstrates the significance of this achievement. The proportionally spaced typewriter immediately leaped to the apex of the world bureaucracy and administrative culture when President Roosevelt was presented with the first machine off the line. The Armistice documents that ended World War Two were typed on an IBM, as was the original United Nations Charter. To a world accustomed to monospaced typewritten documents, a page of typewriting produced with an Executive...was indistinguishable from a page of typeset text. Prime Minister Churchill allegedly responded to Roosevelt that &quot;although he realized their correspondence was very important, there was absolutely no need to have it printed.&quot;

The fonts available for the IBM Executive typewriters helped to convey the impression of typeset text. 
Fonts on monospaced typewriters usually have very wide serifs on narrow letters like &quot;i&quot; so that they visually fill the same horizontal space as letters like &quot;m&quot; and &quot;w&quot;. 
So that these letters do not look out of place, most of the others are given strong serifs as well. 
Along with the constant spacing, these serifs give a distinctive &quot;typewriter look&quot; to documents. 
With proportional spacing, the IBM Executive typewriters could abandon the wide serifs and use fonts that closely resembled those used in typesetting.

IBM&#x27;s Executive typewriters introduced a feature lacking in many mechanical typewriters: the top row included the digits &quot;one&quot; and &quot;zero&quot;; other typewriters generally omitted these. The IBM design obviated substitutions taught by many typing instructors: the letter &quot;o&quot; or &quot;O&quot; for &quot;zero&quot;, and lowercase &quot;l&quot; for &quot;one&quot;. These substitutions were easily identified when compared to an adjacent line typed with the digit keys. Worse, digits in columns of typed numbers would not have lined up properly on the Executive if the typist used the letter substitutions. A full set of dedicated digit keys allowed the Executive&#x27;s digits to all be the same width as each other, so that a typed figure of a given number of digits was always the same total width, regardless of what the digits were. This change also allowed IBM greater flexibility in font design, as the lowercase &quot;l&quot; and uppercase &quot;o&quot; did not have to be usable as the corresponding digits. Having introduced them on the Executive, IBM maintained the separate digit keys on later non-proportional-spacing typewriter models, including the Selectric series.
