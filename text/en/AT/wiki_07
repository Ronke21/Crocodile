<text>Reston is a census-designated place in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, and a principal city of both Northern Virginia and the Washington metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Reston&#x27;s population was 63,226.

Founded in 1964, Reston was influenced by the Garden City movement that emphasized planned, self-contained communities that intermingled green space, residential neighborhoods, and commercial development. The intent of Reston&#x27;s founder, Robert E. Simon, was to build a town that would revolutionize post–World War II concepts of land use and residential/corporate development in suburban America. In 2018, Reston was included in &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Place to Live in Virginia&quot; ranking. Reston is known for its expanses of parks, lakes, golf courses, and bridle paths, and Reston Town Center, a shopping mall with several restaurants.

== History ==
===Colonial era===

In the early days of Colonial America, the land that is present-day Reston was part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a vast grant by King Charles II to Lord Thomas Fairfax that extended from the Potomac to the Rappahannock rivers. The property remained in the Fairfax family until they sold it in 1852.

===19th century===
Carl A. Wiehle and William Dunn bought 6,449 acres in northern Fairfax County along the Washington and Old Dominion (W&amp;OD) Railroad line in 1886, later dividing the land between them, with Wiehle retaining the acreage north of the railroad line. Wiehle envisioned founding a town on the property, including a hotel, parks, and community center, but completed only a handful of homes before his death in 1901.

Wiehle&#x27;s heirs eventually sold the land, which changed hands several times before being purchased by the A. Smith Bowman family, who built a bourbon distillery on the site.

===20th century===

By 1947, the Bowmans had acquired the former Dunn tract south of the railroad, for total holdings of over . In 1961, Robert E. Simon used funds from his family&#x27;s recent sale of Carnegie Hall to buy most of the land, except for 60 acres (240,000 m2) on which the Bowman distillery continued to operate until 1987.

Simon officially launched Reston on April 10, 1964 (his 50th birthday) and named the community using his initials.[7] He laid out seven &quot;guiding principles&quot; that would stress quality of life and serve as the foundation for its future development. His goal was for Restonians to live, work, and play in their own community, with common grounds and scenic beauty shared equally regardless of income level, thereby building a stronger sense of community ties. The initial motto of the community, as articulated by Simon, was &quot;Work, Play, Live&quot; or often was memorialized onto Reston merchandise as, &quot;Live, Work, Play.&quot;

Simon envisioned Reston as a model for clustered residential development, also known as conservation development, which puts a premium on the preservation of open space, landscapes, and wildlife habitats. Reston was the first 20th-century private community in the U.S. to explicitly incorporate natural preservation in its planning.

Simon hired the architectural firm of Whittlesey, Conklin, &amp; Rossant to design his new community. The plans for Reston were designed by architect James Rossant, who studied under Walter Gropius at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and his partner William J. Conklin. From the outset, Rossant and Conklin&#x27;s planning conceptualized the new community as a unified, cohesive, and balanced whole, including landscapes, recreational, cultural, and commercial facilities, and housing for what was envisioned to be a town of 75,000. For Lake Anne Plaza, the first of Reston&#x27;s village centers, the architects combined a small shopping area with a mix of single-family houses, townhouses, and apartments next to a manmade lake featuring a large jet fountain. Close by were the cubist townhouses at Hickory Cluster, designed by modernist architect Charles M. Goodman in the International Style. Lake Anne also included an elementary school, a gasoline station, two churches, an art gallery, and several restaurants. The first section of a senior citizens&#x27; residence facility, the Lake Anne Fellowship House, was completed several years later.

Reston welcomed its first residents in late 1964. During the community&#x27;s first year, its continued development was covered in such major media publications as &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which featured the new town in a front-page article extolling it as &quot;one of the most striking communities&quot; in the United States. Nikki Hornsby performed an hour-long paid concert, singing with her guitar outside for this new Reston Community.

Simon ran into financial difficulties as sales in the new community flagged. To keep his project going, he accepted a loan of $15 million from Gulf Oil that allowed him to pay off his creditors. Even so, sales were sluggish as Simon&#x27;s reluctance to compromise on his high standards for building designs and materials meant that a townhouse in Reston could cost as much as a single-family house elsewhere in Fairfax County.

By 1967, Gulf Oil forced Simon out and formed Gulf Reston, Inc., to manage the community. Gulf retained many of Simon&#x27;s employees and continued to adhere largely to the spirit of the original Reston master plan as envisioned by Simon. During the 1970s, Gulf built the Reston International Center near the intersection of Sunrise Valley and Reston Parkway and added low- to moderate-income housing to the community&#x27;s residential mix, including the Cedar Ridge, Laurel Glade, and Fox Mill apartment developments. Gulf also constructed housing for employees of the U.S. Geological Survey headquarters, located on Sunrise Valley Drive.

Gulf Reston put a premium on protecting Reston&#x27;s open spaces and pedestrian-friendly landscape throughout its ownership. The corporation also transferred title for many Reston recreational facilities, including land, parks, lakes, and facilities, to the Reston Homeowners Association, thereby preserving them from overdevelopment.

Within ten years of buying Simon out, Gulf opted to begin pulling out of the real estate business to focus exclusively on energy. It sold Reston&#x27;s developed portions, including three completed village centers (Lake Anne, Tall Oaks, and Hunters Woods), the Reston International Center, and Isaac Newton Square, to an investment firm.

In 1978, the company finalized the sale of Reston&#x27;s remaining 3,700 undeveloped acres to Mobil, which pledged to continue respecting the ideals of Robert Simon. Mobil formed the Reston Land Corporation as a subsidiary to manage its holdings and began developing the remaining residential areas in what would become the South Lakes and North Point villages. Reston Land introduced a wider mix of housing choices, including more townhouses and smaller “starter” homes, and completed the North County Government Center, which houses the Reston District police station, Fairfax County government offices, and a regional library and homeless shelter.

Reston Land also broke ground on the 460-acre Reston Town Center which formed part of Simon&#x27;s original master plan for Reston. The first four-block development of this multi-phase mixed-use project were opened in 1996 and included a hotel, several restaurants, a cinema, and office buildings.

By 1996, Mobil had decided to follow Gulf Oil&#x27;s steps and pull out of the land management business. It sold its entire Mobil Land Development subsidiary, including its Reston holdings, to Westbrook Partners, LLC, for $324 million. As Reston Town Center continued to develop, Boston Properties emerged as a leading player. The company became the sole owner of the core mixed-use tracts in Reston Town Center when it completed the purchase of the Fountain Square office/retail complex in 2012.

==Geography==

Reston is located in northern Fairfax County at . Neighboring communities are Great Falls to the north, Wolf Trap to the east, Franklin Farm, Floris, and McNair to the southwest, the town of Herndon to the west, and Dranesville to the northwest.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Reston has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.10%, is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Reston has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.
===Planning and zoning===

Reston is divided into three separate planning areas: the original Planned Residential Community (PRC) area that governs the majority of residential areas in the community; the Reston Town Center (RTC) District, which includes all of the high-density, high-rise portions of Town Center; and the Transit Station Area (TSA) on either side of the Dulles Toll Road.

From Reston&#x27;s inception, planning and zoning in the PRC area has emphasized the inclusion and integration of common grounds, parks, large swaths of wooded areas with picturesque runs (streams), wildflower meadows, golf courses, public swimming pools, bridle paths, a bike path, four lakes, tennis courts, and extensive foot pathways. Reston was built in wooded areas of oak, maple, sycamore, and Virginia pine, and remains heavily wooded. Extensive canopy guidance protects tree cover throughout the PRC, and homeowners are prohibited from removing trees larger than 4 inches in diameter without written permission from Reston&#x27;s Design Review Board. Total zoning density throughout the overall PRC area is currently capped at 13 persons per acre. This figure, however, does not include residents in Fairfax County workforce and affordable units (WDUs/ADUs), as well as the &quot;bonus&quot; units developers are allowed to add to their projects in compensation for having included ADUs in their proposals,

Reston&#x27;s five village centers are included in the PRC area. Simon envisioned a total of seven village centers, but only five were developed. The village centers and the town center are an important part of Reston. Each village center, all of which (save North Point) predate the Reston Town Center, was intended to be a short walk from most homes and incorporate the daily retail and community service needs of residents. Moderately denser developments, such as apartments and townhouse clusters, as well as some single-family homes, encircle each center. The first to be built was the critically acclaimed Lake Anne, followed by (in chronological order) Hunters Woods, Tall Oaks, South Lakes, and North Point. By 2015, however, Tall Oaks had become defunct as a village center and was purchased by a local development firm, Tall Oaks Development Company, with the intent of rezoning the 7.6-acre parcel and converting it to residential housing.

===Reston Town Center District===
During Mobil&#x27;s ownership period, the corporation worked with Fairfax County to create a new Town Center District to govern planning and design for existing and new development in the core Town Center area and to remove it from the oversight of Reston Association&#x27;s Design Review Board. Review and comment of all RTCD development proposals is limited to members of the RTC District Association, which is overseen by the 9-member Board of Directors, 7 of whom represent commercial property owners.

===Transit Station Area===
The core portion of the Transit Station Area (TSA), consisting of the 12-lane Dulles Toll Road, Metro&#x27;s heavy rail line, and the office parks on either side—cuts a half-mile wide swath through the community, with four north–south connections. A fifth crossover at Soapstone Drive has been proposed by Fairfax County transportation planners, though funding has not yet been identified. Zoning and planning for TSA development is governed by Fairfax County; as with the RTC District, no direct oversight from Reston Association is included, while input from and notification to PRC residents is limited. TSA zoning guidance explicitly calls for this area to be designed as an urban center, with 30 million square feet of new and existing office development and 44,000 residential units.

Reston also serves as the headquarters for the North American command of the German armed forces which oversees upwards up 1,500 troops deployed in the United States at any given time.

==Arts and culture==

A special tax district within Fairfax County was created to fund various recreational, educational, and cultural activities in Reston. The Reston Community Center (RCC) is a core element, with its main building in south Reston at Hunters Woods Plaza and featuring a theater, indoor heated swimming pool with jacuzzi, ballroom, meeting rooms, and classroom space. A smaller RCC branch is at Lake Anne Plaza.

Reston is home to several performing arts groups. The Reston Community Players (originally known as Reston Players) has been in operation since 1966 and performs at Reston Community Center&#x27;s Center Stage in Hunters Woods Plaza. The Reston Chorale was founded in the late 1960s as a mixed-voice chorus comprising both professional and amateur singers. The Reston Community Orchestra, launched in 1988, also offers regular performances throughout the year, generally at the Reston Community Center. In the summer, free public concerts are offered at both Reston Town Center and at Lake Anne Plaza.

The Greater Reston Arts Center (GRACE), founded by local artists, is home-based at Reston Town Center and sponsors the annual Northern Virginia Fine Arts Festival. The privately owned Reston Art Gallery at Lake Anne Plaza includes both regular art exhibits and artist studio spaces.

Reston&#x27;s sole museum, the Reston Historic Trust &amp; Museum, is also located in Lake Anne Plaza. It has maps, photos, and books that provide a detailed look at Reston from the 1960s on.

The Washington West Film Festival is an autumn event in Reston center. The festival, co-founded by Mark Maxey and Brad Russell, offers a juried array of feature films, shorts and documentaries.

==Parks and recreation==

Building on Robert Simon&#x27;s emphasis on preserving green space and providing recreational opportunities, Reston features over 55 miles of walking and hiking paths for residents, with currently about 250 acres of woodlands and open space. Reston is noted for its tree canopy, which currently covers about half of Reston&#x27;s total area. It is one of only eight localities in the U.S. to be a member of the worldwide Biophilic Cities Organization, which promotes the importance of protecting and promoting nature within urban areas.

The centerpiece of Reston&#x27;s focus on nature is the Vernon J. Walker Nature Education Center. The Nature Center&#x27;s of hardwood forest include a picnic pavilion, campfire ring, and other facilities that support its outreach programs. Its LEED gold-certified Nature House offers exhibits, an on-site naturalist, and various programs for children; it may also be rented for community or private meetings.

Two golf courses are located in Reston. The 166-acre Reston National Golf Course in south Reston is certified by Audubon International as a Cooperative Sanctuary on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Hidden Creek Country Club was purchased in 2017 by Wheelock Communities, a real estate development company.

The Washington and Old Dominion (W&amp;OD) trail, which runs through Reston, is a pathway built solely for pedestrian and bicycle traffic along the former W&amp;OD train line.

Reston contains four manmade lakes: Lake Anne, Lake Audubon, Lake Newport, and Lake Thoreau. Also within Reston&#x27;s area is the Lake Fairfax Park, operated by Fairfax County and which features boat rentals, a large outdoor pool complex called &quot;The Water Mine&quot;, overnight campground facilities, and picnic areas.

A 30-acre (120,000 m2) zoo, NOVA Wild, is located on the northeast edge of the community. It is dedicated to family-friendly animal interaction with bus rides and feeding stations. Animals include lambs, camels, zebras, antelope, bison, cheetah, emu, camels, goats, reptiles, horses, buffalo, and waterfowl.

Reston has an assortment of pools, including a year-round indoor pool at the Reston Community Center. Ice skating is available year-round at SkateQuest, a privately run indoor rink, and during the winter on an outdoor rink at Reston Town Center&#x27;s Pavilion.

==Government==
Reston is an unincorporated area in Fairfax County, and its schools, roads, and law enforcement services are provided by Fairfax County.

Parks, recreation facilities, and common grounds, as well as the extensive trail system, are overseen by the Reston Association under the provisions of the Reston Deed, the community&#x27;s basic governing document. A standard assessment is levied on each apartment or lot (for townhouses and houses). The Deed also allows for reduced assessments for those who &quot;qualify for real estate tax reduction by Fairfax County Ordinance; (ii) their units are subsidized by the federal or state government; or (iii) their units are designed and used primarily for elderly congregate care or assisted living facilities and occupied by low or moderate income residents.&quot;

Reston&#x27;s individual clusters or neighborhoods have their own neighborhood associations which also levy assessments to cover grounds upkeep, snow removal, trash pick-up, and other maintenance. Each cluster has its own elected board of directors who report to the residents of that cluster.

The majority of Reston lies within Virginia&#x27;s 11th congressional district and is currently represented in Congress by Representative Gerry Connolly (D). It is represented by Karen Keys-Gamarra (D) in the Virginia House of Delegates, and by Jennifer Boysko (D) in the State Senate.

While Reston has, from its inception, been an unincorporated area, several efforts have been made to achieve town status, primarily to gain more control over zoning and development decisions, which now are the purview of Fairfax County elected officials and staff. Robert Simon initially explored the option of incorporation as a town but was blocked by Fairfax County. Simon asserted to an interviewer that Fairfax officials informed him they would deny Reston access to Fairfax&#x27;s water and sewer lines if he sought incorporation for his new community. In 1980, a group of Reston residents were successful in pushing for a referendum to incorporate Reston as a town, but the referendum failed in 1980 by a 2–1 margin. A similar initiative in 2005, which was publicly supported by Robert Simon, also failed.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===

As a part of Fairfax County, Reston is served by Fairfax County Public Schools and a number of private schools. Reston has one high school within its boundaries, South Lakes High School, which serves most of Reston. Adjacent to South Lakes High School is Reston&#x27;s only middle school, Langston Hughes Middle School. Students who live in the far northern part of Reston attend Herndon High School.

===Colleges and universities===
Reston has several higher education resources, including a satellite campus of NVCC (Northern Virginia Community College), the University of Phoenix – Northern Virginia campus, and Marymount University – Reston Center.

===Public libraries===
Fairfax County Public Library operates the Reston Regional Library. Also located in Reston is the United States Geological Survey Library, a federal research library that is open to the public with over 3 million items, ranging from books and journals to maps and photographs, as well as field record notebooks.

==Media==
Reston is served primarily by the Washington, D.C. media market. The community lies within the local newspaper distribution area for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, as well as two local publications, the &quot;Fairfax Times&quot; and the &quot;Reston Connection&quot;. All four also offer digital subscriptions. A third local paper, the &quot;Observer,&quot; which covered Reston and nearby Herndon, closed in 2010 and transferred coverage to AOL&#x27;s Patch service of local digital news sites, which launched a Reston site in August 2010. Website &quot;Reston Now&quot; provides daily local news coverage. In addition, multiple television and radio stations in the Washington metropolitan area provide coverage of local developments.

==Transportation==

Reston sits astride the Dulles Toll Road, from Tysons and the Capital Beltway to the east, and from Washington Dulles International Airport to the west. Four roads cross the community from north to south: Fairfax County Parkway on the western side, Reston Parkway through the center of town, Wiehle Avenue through the northeastern residential section, and Hunter Mill Road on the eastern border.

The Metro&#x27;s Silver Line, which runs along the Dulles Toll Road, opened its first Reston station, Wiehle-Reston East, on July 26, 2014. Two additional stations, Reston Town Center and Herndon, opened on November 15, 2022 and serve the western half of Reston as part of an expansion towards Dulles International Airport.

The Reston Internal Bus System (RIBS) provides five regularly circulating routes connecting Reston&#x27;s village centers, using Reston Town Center as a hub. Fairfax County&#x27;s Fairfax Connector and Metrobus service both link commuters in Reston to Metro stations as well as points throughout Fairfax County.

==Events ==
=== Ebola virus scare ===

In December 1989, a filovirus, at first suspected to be Ebola virus (EBOV), was discovered among crab-eating macaques (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;) within a facility operated by Covance (now Fortrea). This attracted significant media attention, including the publication of the popular 1994 book &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; and the subsequent development of the National Geographic Channel TV Series &quot;The Hot Zone (television series)&quot;. The filovirus was found to be distinct from EBOV and to be nonpathogenic for humans. It was named after the community, and is now known as Reston virus (RESTV). Macaques found to be or suspected to be infected with RESTV were euthanized, and the facility was sterilized. The facility was located in an office park near Sunset Hills Road and Wiehle Avenue. It was eventually torn down, and a daycare was built in its place.

==Accolades and coverage==
The growth and development of Reston has been monitored by newspaper articles, national magazines, and scholarly journals on architecture and land use. In 1967 the First Lady of the United States, Lady Bird Johnson, visited Reston to take a walking tour along its pathways as part of her interest in beautification projects. Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin visited Reston elementary schools named for them. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; featured a road trip to Reston in January 2006, and the website &quot;Beyond DC&quot; has a page devoted to Reston with almost 150 photos.

Reston and Robert Simon were recognized by the American Institute of Certified Planners for their significant contributions to town planning. The AICP further recognized Reston as a National Planning Landmark, praising Simon&#x27;s vision for ensuring that fields and trees would be threaded throughout the residential and commercial portions of the community, and recognized it as &quot;one of the finest examples of American 20th century conceptual new town planning.&quot;

In 2017, the Lake Anne Village Center&#x27;s historic district was named to the U.S. Park Service&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places, which serves as the official list of historic places worthy of preservation and protection.

Reston is one of just a handful of communities in the U.S. that has been designated a Backyard Wildlife Habitat community.

Reston generally follows &quot;new urbanism&quot; guidelines. The residential portion of the town was built with an extensive path system, and Fairfax County has constructed many sidewalks over the past decades. The downtown and original areas also incorporate mixed-use development, with more mixed-use development planned near Washington Metro stations.

However, Reston differs from New Urbanism principles in several important ways. Many buildings in the PRC area are oriented away from main streets, and several major arteries lack complete sidewalk networks as a result of Fairfax County&#x27;s control over Reston&#x27;s transportation planning: until recently, the Fairfax County zoning code only required developers to build sidewalks in certain limited cases. The original inward orientation of the village centers was an intentional design element by Reston&#x27;s early planners, who wished to avoid the commercial strip look that dominates many suburban developments.

<text>Rose Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 20,226 at the 2010 census. Built in the mid-1950s, Rose Hill is the largest of the subdivisions that make up the CDP, which is just southwest of Alexandria; others include Wilton Woods, Burgundy Village, and Winslow Heights. Street addresses are in Alexandria ZIP codes 22310, 22303 and 22315.

==Geography==
Rose Hill is located in southeastern Fairfax County at (38.789263, −77.108971). It is bordered to the north by the city of Alexandria, to the east by Huntington, to the south by Groveton and Hayfield, to the southwest by Kingstowne, and to the west by Franconia. The CDP&#x27;s borders follow the Capital Beltway and CSX rail line on the north, South Van Dorn Street and some smaller roads on the west, South Kings Highway on the south, and Shaffer Drive and Telegraph Road on the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Rose Hill CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.28%, is water.

==History==
The community of Rose Hill derives its name from an 18th-century plantation once located nearby; this was established by Daniel French, the first builder of Pohick Church, on land that had been part of the Gunston Hall estate. The house stood on high ground, and was described as having a fine view of the nearby valley and the Potomac River in the distance. The land had been purchased by Daniel French Sr., in 1723, passing to his son, Daniel French Jr., in 1736. At the latter&#x27;s death, the property went first to his wife Penelope and then to Elizabeth Dulaney, their daughter. The Dulaneys sold the plantation early in the 1800s, and between 1810 and 1868 it passed through the hands of numerous owners.
On September 28, 1863, during the American Civil War, the house was the site of a raid by John S. Mosby and his raiders. They had ridden into Alexandria in an attempt to capture Francis Harrison Pierpont, whom they expected to find at the City Hotel. Discovering that he had left, the raiders burned a railroad bridge before heading along Telegraph Road to Rose Hill Plantation, where they sought Pierpont&#x27;s aide, Col. Daniel F. Dulaney; the colonel&#x27;s son, French, was among Mosby&#x27;s company. Neighbor Anne S. Frobel later wrote in her diary that a &quot;party of Mosby’s boys came very unexpectedly to Rose Hill, and took off Col. Dulaney. One of them was his own son. …This boy’s first greeting to his father when he rushed into the room where his father was in bed [was] ... ‘How do Pa—I’m very glad to see you,’ and the father’s answer sitting up in bed, with proper dignity, ‘Well, sir, I’m d-sorry to see you.’ But they took him down to Richmond nevertheless.&quot; The colonel survived the war, but his son was killed in 1864. In the years after the conflict, the area around Rose Hill was the site of farming and gravel mining operations. The frame house burned in 1895. The last owner of the property was Robert L. May.

What is today the community of Rose Hill was established in 1954; that same year the body of Daniel French Jr., which had been buried at the plantation at his death in 1771, was moved to Pohick Church. Within four years a Safeway had been constructed, as had two swimming pools serving residents. An elementary school was opened in 1957, a year after the foundation of the Rose Hill Civic Association. In 1970 the Fairfax County Park Authority purchased 148 acres in the area for construction of a golf course; the Greendale Golf Course was dedicated on August 19, 1976. Today it is one of eight courses managed by the Park Authority. Its property line marks the boundary of the community.

Today the history of Rose Hill is commemorated with a historic marker erected by the Fairfax County History Commission in 2000, located in front of the John Marshall Library. Another marker, erected as part of the Civil War Trails Program, tells the story of the 1863 raid. Also in the vicinity was the plantation Clermont, birthplace of Fitzhugh Lee. The site of the plantation is noted by a marker erected by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources in 2004; located in front of Mark Twain Middle School, it is south of the plantation&#x27;s actual location. Landmarks in Rose Hill also included a pair of silos that were once part of a dairy farm in the vicinity, and which were later converted to serve as showers for the Rose Hill Swimming and Tennis Club. Attempts were made to list them on the Fairfax County Inventory of Historic Sites.

<doc id="137591" wikidata="Q1374873" url="?curid=137591" title="Seven Corners, Virginia">
<text>Seven Corners is a commercial center and census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 9,255 at the 2010 census. Seven Corners has a &quot;Falls Church&quot; mailing address but is not within Falls Church&#x27;s city limits. The area got its name from the intersection of State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike and East Broad Street), U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard), State Route 613 (Sleepy Hollow Road), State Route 338 (Hillwood Avenue) and Wilson Boulevard (also part of State Route 613). The junction of these four roads once created seven corners.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2), all of it land. The Upper Long Branch of Four Mile Run passes through the northernmost low point of the CDP, adjacent Brook Drive, and that adjacent land is registered with Fairfax County Park authority for development, under a phased plan.

The area is built on Munson&#x27;s Hill, and overlooks adjacent Upton&#x27;s Hill. The views to the south and west are unbroken, and offer scenic vistas in the directions of Annandale and Fairfax City.

== History ==

Seven Corners was known as Fort Buffalo from the American Civil War until the 1950s. The area took its name from a fortification constructed in October 1862 by men of the 21st New York Infantry. Fort Buffalo stood on the southern side of the Leesburg Pike, at its current intersection with Sleepy Hollow Road. The story of the fort is described in a local history of the Civil War entitled &quot;A Virginia Village Goes to War--Falls Church During the Civil War&quot;. The fort was built at that location to take advantage of the excellent views to the east and south—the direction from which Confederate Army troops were thought to possibly come.

After the war the massive fortification of Fort Buffalo was dismantled but other earthworks remained and were easily visible through the 1930s.

The change of place name in the 1950s came about due to the construction of Lee Memorial Boulevard, now known as Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50). The construction of Route 50 caused the formation of a seven cornered intersection—or did until the mouth of Wilson Boulevard was rerouted slightly to avoid all those roadways converging on a single point.

With the advent of Route 50 the area quickly developed into an important commercial center with the opening in 1956 of Seven Corners Shopping Center, one of the first malls in the Washington region. The original center featured an iconic sign combined with a modernistic entry arch; this was later removed. The original Route 50, envisioned and built as a landscaped parkway linking Washington, D.C., with the Shenandoah Valley, has since evolved into a commercial corridor and its function as a link to the valley has been assumed by Interstate 66.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 8,701 people, 3,304 households, and 1,893 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 3,378 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 49.10% White, 6.68% African American, 0.28% Native American, 20.54% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 16.17% from other races, and 7.17% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 40.60% of the population.

There were 3,304 households, out of which 28.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.9% were married couples living together, 10.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.7% were non-families. 33.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.62 and the average family size was 3.30.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 21.2% under the age of 18, 11.5% from 18 to 24, 41.6% from 25 to 44, 19.5% from 45 to 64, and 6.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 108.9 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $44,579, and the median income for a family was $43,211. Males had a median income of $31,444 versus $30,743 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $20,475. About 15.9% of families and 18.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.3% of those under age 18 and 17.6% of those age 65 or over.

== Notable locations ==

The Seven Corners Shopping Center is located in the Seven Corners CDP. The Eden Center Vietnamese-American strip mall is located across Wilson Boulevard from the Seven Corners Shopping Center, just outside the Seven Corners CDP in Falls Church.

The Dar Al-Hijrah mosque is in Seven Corners.

The parking garage of a Home Depot hardware store in the Seven Corners Shopping Center was the scene of one of the shootings in the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks; Linda Franklin was slain while she returned to her car in the crowded parking garage.

==Management of traffic at the intersection==
The namesake &quot;seven&quot; corners has long since disappeared, having been replaced by somewhat more motorist-friendly intersections which well exceed the former seven. Motorists bound in any direction are subject to one or more stoplight signals. There is a pedestrian bridge over US 50. The roads themselves are not pedestrian-friendly. The County has a traffic management and commercial development plan in place, work has begun, and the land between Leesburg Pike and Wilson Boulevard adjacent Patrick Henry Drive is now largely owned by the County.

The traffic is managed as follows from the following roads:

*US Route 50 (US 50) is a highway that runs east–west along Arlington Boulevard in the area. US 50 has a series of frontage roads that connect to the other roadways in the intersection. Through traffic can continue on the highway itself unimpeded by the local traffic in the intersection.
*State Road 7 (SR 7) is a four- to six-lane roadway, separated by a median following East Broad Street to the northwest or Leesburg Pike to the southeast of the intersection. Motorists may access any of the other roads.
*State Road 338 (SR 338) terminates in the intersection from the northwest. Traffic proceeding southeast defaults onto SR 7 east.
*Sleepy Hollow Road terminates with northbound traffic defaulting to follow SR 7 to the southeast. Secondary State Route 613 follows Sleepy Hollow to the south and continues along Wilson Boulevard to the northeast.
*Wilson Boulevard terminates at the intersection from the northeast. Southbound traffic defaults to follow the US 50 frontage road northwesterly which connects to SR 7 westbound. From this frontage road, traffic may access all other directions of the other roads in the intersection.

* 22153 (Burke/West Springfield/Newington Forest)

The following are total area, water area, and land area statistics (in square miles) for the four Springfield zip codes:

==History==
===19th century===
A saw and grist mill was constructed in the vicinity of present-day Springfield between 1796 and 1800. Owned by James Keene, it gave its name to today&#x27;s Old Keene Mill Road. The mill served farms in the area for around sixty years before its discontinuation when William H. Keene was convicted and imprisoned for the 1855 murder of Lewis Quincy Hall. Nothing remains of it today save for two mill races.

Springfield was founded in 1847 around the Orange and Alexandria Railroad&#x27;s Daingerfield Station; this is today the Backlick Road Virginia Railway Express station, located off Backlick Road. The area was named for &quot;Springfield Farm&quot;, owned by Henry Daingerfield, an Alexandria businessman who sat on the railroad&#x27;s board of directors. The post office was completed sometime after 1851. It was in existence at the time of the American Civil War, being the site of a skirmish on October 3, 1861, and a Confederate raid on August 3, 1863. The station served as the first Springfield Post Office from 1866 to 1868.

In 1877, Richard Moore petitioned for a post office, which he named Moor; it was located about a little over a mile south of the station, near the intersection of Fairfax (now Old Keene Mill) and Backlick roads. The post office name was changed in 1881 to Garfield to honor the late President James A. Garfield, who had been assassinated that year. 

===20th century===
In 1907, the Garfield post office closed and a new postal station named Corbett, after the then-landowner, opened back at the railroad station. The name &quot;Springfield&quot; was reinstated for good on June 27, 1910, although the name Garfield continued to appear on maps at least through the 1930s. The post office was moved to a new site in 1933.

Until at least 1946, Springfield remained a rural crossroads, when real estate developer Edward Carr decided to subdivide the area for suburban development along the recently opened Henry Shirley Highway (now I-95/I-395). Carr believed this to be the last easily accessible tract within of Washington, D.C., and the newly developed area grew quickly. 

In 1950, the area had an estimated population of 1,000; Springfield United Methodist Church was established in 1954 and John Lewis High School (Formerly Robert E. Lee) was built in 1957. By 1960, the population was reported as over 10,000; it grew past 25,000 by 1970 with the North and West Springfield neighborhoods.

Between 1973 and 1975, Springfield became a major retail destination with the opening of the Springfield Mall, now Springfield Town Center. (the second regional shopping center in Northern Virginia after Tysons Corner), as well as the Springfield and Brookfield shopping centers.

In the 1980s and 1990s, retail and high-density housing expanded in the area, at least until the opening of the Franconia-Springfield Parkway in 1996, and the Franconia-Springfield Metro and Virginia Rail Express Station in 1997.

===21st century===
The mall was renovated and re-opened in 2014.

==Buildings==

The center of Springfield is at Route 644 (Old Keene Mill Road / Franconia Road) and Route 617. The old &quot;Garfield&quot; name still survives in the nearby Garfield Elementary School.

The Sydenstricker School, completed in 1928, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

===Shopping===


Springfield Mall was a large indoor shopping mall near the Springfield Interchange, the intersection of Interstate highways I-95 and I-495. It contained several anchor stores and a food court. In 2001, two of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks, Hani Hanjour and Khalid al-Mihdhar, illegally obtained state identification at the mall&#x27;s DMV office. In 2005, gang members stabbed two people at the mall. and a fatal shooting occurred in December 2007.

In 2005, the mall was purchased by Vornado Realty Trust, which closed the structure, renovated and reopened it in 2014 as &quot;Springfield Town Center&quot;.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Central Springfield is dominated by the Springfield Interchange, popularly known as the &quot;Mixing Bowl&quot; or the &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, a name taken from an earlier interchange near the Pentagon. The interchange includes three Interstates (I-95, I-395, and I-495), with two exits less than a half mile apart, with two roads (Commerce Street and Route 644 (Old Keene Mill Road / Franconia Road)) going over or under I-95 within less than a half mile, and is further complicated by the presence of a separate, reversible high-occupancy vehicle lane passing through the center of two of the interstates.

Built between 1999 and 2007 at a cost of $676 million, the Springfield Interchange Improvement Project was finished on time and on budget, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation, and dedicated on July 18, 2007, by Virginia Governor Timothy M. Kaine.

Known originally as Peach Grove, the area received the designation &quot;Tysons Crossroads&quot; after the Civil War. William Tyson, a Maryland native from Cecil County, purchased a tract of land from A. Lawrence Foster. Tyson served as postmaster of the now discontinued Peach Grove Post Office from 1854 to 1866.

===20th century===
As recently as the 1950s, Tysons was a quiet rural intersection flanked by a few small stores and a fruit stand operated by the Tyson descendants, who sold apples and apple cider from the corner of their property. In 1963, the Tysons area moved from a country crossroads to a giant commercial urban area with the awarding of contracts at the interchange of VA Route 7 and VA Route 123.

In 1962, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors approved the Tysons Corner Shopping Center, now Tysons Corner Center, which was planned to be within a triangle bordered by Chain Bridge Road, Leesburg Pike, and the Capital Beltway. Developers proclaimed it the largest enclosed mall in the world when it opened on July 25, 1968.

===21st century===

In the early 21st century, an influx of technology companies into Northern Virginia led to new office buildings and hotels to the landscape. The rapid growth of Tysons in comparison to other locations near the Capital Beltway has been the topic of numerous studies. One factor was the aggressive promotion of Tysons by Earle Williams, for many years the CEO of the defense contracting firm Braddock Dunn &amp; McDonald. Tysons serves as a downtown of Fairfax County, with one quarter of all office space and one eighth of all retail in the county, despite occupying just 1% of the county. It is an auto-oriented edge city with severe traffic congestion, and faces competition from the urban areas of Arlington and newer suburban edge cities such as Dulles.

In 2008, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to begin a 40-year plan to urbanize Tysons around the coming four stops of Washington Metro&#x27;s Silver Line in the vein of neighboring Arlington County&#x27;s Rosslyn-Ballston corridor. A preliminary estimate from the Fairfax County Department of Transportation suggested that $7.83 billion in transportation infrastructure projects would be necessary to transform Tysons Corner into a high-density urban center from 2010 to 2050, most of which would be allocated to both construction phases of the Silver Line. Existing plans call for construction of a grid layout for streets around the rail stations, projected to cost $742 million. An additional $1 billion will be spent on further transit and street grid projects from 2030 to 2050.

In November 2012, the county approved Arbor Row, a mixed-used development of office and residential high-rises, ground-floor retail, and underground parking near the Tysons Corner (now ) station. In April 2013, the county approved Scotts Run Station South, a development containing 17 buildings, including six office and residential buildings, one hotel, and ground-floor retail near the McLean Station. This development alone will be larger than Reston Town Center.

Ahead of the Washington Metro Silver Line opening in mid-2014, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and the Tysons Partnership, a nonprofit association that represents the area&#x27;s stakeholders, began rebranding the area as simply &quot;Tysons&quot;, dropping &quot;Corner&quot; from the name. The change started as a matter of convenience, but later took hold to market the change in the area&#x27;s character, according to members of the board. The change was unofficial at the time, and either &quot;Tysons&quot; or &quot;Tysons Corner&quot; could be used in addresses. But in November 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau announced the CDP&#x27;s name would officially be changed to Tysons as of the next summer.

Tysons is seen as a modern prototype of an edge city. In its 40-year history, it has been given substantial redevelopment offers for the next 20 to 30 years. The area has seen growing interest as plans to make it an urban center were begun in 2010. Private-sector development in the United States in combination with political groups have begun the planning process behind the redevelopment of Tysons. Two forces are at work in the creation of an edge city, as it can be beneficial to both parties. With the redevelopment process taking place there has been an aggressive push to bring in businesses to Tysons. Edge cities such as Tysons have specific regional accessibility that has been enhanced by major projects funded by federal and state governments. One of the bigger enhancements to transportation specifically to Tysons was the construction &quot;of the Washington Dulles International Airport and an associated access road and the Capital Beltway but also expansions to state roads&quot;.

The plan remains to see Tysons become Fairfax County&#x27;s downtown core. So far, &quot;eight districts have been delimited, with four centered on new metro stations being transit-oriented development districts&quot;. Future plans for transportation around the area continue to be made. &quot;The aims of the plan are for 75% of development to be within half a mile of metro stations, an urban center of 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents, a jobs balance of 4.0 per household&quot;.

==Geography==

==Demographics==

Tysons was one of the inspirations for, and figures prominently in, Joel Garreau&#x27;s pioneering study of the edge city phenomenon. Among the reasons for calling Tysons an edge city is that, in contrast to typical &quot;bedroom&quot; suburbs, people commute into it in the morning and away from it at night, with a daytime population greater than 100,000 and a nighttime population of fewer than 20,000. Planners envision up to 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents in coming decades.

<text>Vienna () is a town in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Vienna has a population of 16,473. Significantly more people live in ZIP codes with the Vienna postal addresses (22180, 22181, and 22182), bordered approximately by Interstate 66 on the south, Interstate 495 on the east, Route 7 to the north, and Hunter Mill Road to the west, than in the town itself.

==History==
European settlement in the region dates to the mid-18th century. In 1754, prominent soldier and landowner Colonel Charles Broadwater settled within the town boundaries. Broadwater&#x27;s son-in-law, John Hunter, built the first recorded house there in 1767, naming it Ayr Hill to recall his birthplace, Ayr, Scotland. That name was then applied to the tiny community. The town&#x27;s name was changed in the 1850s, when a doctor, William Hendrick, settled there and the town renamed itself after his hometown, Phelps, New York, which was then known as Vienna.

===American Civil War===
On June 17, 1861, the Battle of Vienna, one of the earliest armed clashes of the American Civil War, was fought in Vienna. A Union Army unit under Brigadier General Robert C. Schenck approached Vienna from the east by train but was ambushed and forced to retreat by a Confederate force led by Colonel Maxcy Gregg. Several historical markers in Vienna detail its Civil War history. In addition, in the town center lies the well preserved Freeman House; which, in 1861, was the polling place for the secession vote and was used during the war by both sides as a hospital. The house has been turned into a museum and gift shop.

The First Baptist Church of Vienna was founded in 1867, and the original church structure was built using Union Army barracks lumber obtained through the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. This church building was also the town&#x27;s first black public school. The first white public school was built in 1872. 

===20th century===
A permanent black elementary school was built, and was later named for its long-time principal, Louise Archer. In fall 1965, Fairfax County Public Schools were completely desegregated.

Later, the town was a stop on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad called Rappahannock Station, but the O&amp;A was eventually absorbed into the Norfolk Southern system, and the Remington spur fell into disuse.

Remington was the site of the First Battle of Rappahannock Station and the Second Battle of Rappahannock Station during the American Civil War. The Battle of Brandy Station was fought just across the Rappahannock River. Colonel John S. Mosby made raids in the town during the war. Later, Mosby made his home and practiced law in nearby Warrenton, Virginia.

From 1985 to mid-2020, the town was among the last municipalities still using a Confederate battle flag in its official seal.

<text>Warrenton is a town in Fauquier County, Virginia, United States. It is the county seat. The population was 10,057 as of the 2020 census, an increase from 9,611 at the 2010 census and 6,670 at the 2000 census. The estimated population in July 2021 was 10,109. It is at the junction of U.S. Route 15, U.S. Route 17, U.S. Route 29, and U.S. Route 211. The town is in the Piedmont region of Virginia just east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The well-known Airlie Conference Center is north of Warrenton, and the historic Vint Hill Farms military facility is east. Fauquier Hospital is located in the town. Surrounded by Virginia wine and horse country, Warrenton is a popular destination outside Washington, D.C.

Warrenton shares some services with the county, such as schools and the county landfill. The area was home to Bethel Military Academy.

==History==

=== 18th century and founding ===
The settlement which would grow into the town of Warrenton began as a crossroads at the junction of the Falmouth-Winchester and Alexandria-Culpeper roads, where a trading post called the Red Store was located. In the 1790s, a courthouse was built in the area, and the location was known as &quot;Fauquier Courthouse&quot;.

=== 19th century and the American Civil War ===
The Town of Warrenton was incorporated on January 5, 1810, and named for General Joseph Warren, a Revolutionary War hero. Richard Henry Lee donated the land for the county seat. John S. Horner, Secretary of Wisconsin Territory and Acting Governor of Michigan Territory, was born in Warrenton. John Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, was from Germantown, modern-day Midland, south of Warrenton.

Warrenton was connected to the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in 1853 via a branch line. Warrenton&#x27;s connection to the line had previously been proposed, but construction hasn&#x27;t begun until 1852. Given the rail line&#x27;s strategic usage during the American Civil War, the Warrenton Branch was a target for attack twice. Because of this, the railroad was left largely abandoned and unusable by 1863. Southern Railway resumed passenger service to the town from 1909 to 1944 with commercial service continuing through the 1980s. Norfolk Southern ended service entirely in 1989 with the removal of tracks. 
Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby made raids in the town during the American Civil War and later made his home and practiced law in Warrenton. The Warren Green Hotel building hosted many famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, President Theodore Roosevelt, and divorcée Wallis Simpson. Union General George B. McClellan bade farewell to his officers November 11, 1862, from the steps of the hotel. It now hosts some offices of the Fauquier County government.

Arthur Jordan, a black American man, was lynched by a mob of approximately 60–75 men in white hoods in the early hours of January 19, 1880. Jordan had been accused of miscegenation and bigamy for eloping with Elvira (Lucille) Corder, the daughter of his white employer, Nathan Corder, a landowner and farmer in the upper part of the county along the Rappahannock River. A group of local men hunted the pair down near Williamsport, Maryland, captured Mr. Jordan and returned him to Fauquier, whereupon he was delivered to the town jail. Later that night, the masked lynch mob gained access to the jail and dragged Jordan to the nearby town cemetery, where he was hanged from a small locust tree. Ms. Corder remained in Maryland, estranged from her family, until her death a few years later. News of the lynching was reported in papers across the nation. Even some foreign newspapers, such as Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, reprinted accounts of the event.

=== 20th century ===
In 1909, a fire destroyed almost half the structures in the town and was halted with the use of dynamite to create a firebreak to stop the flames from spreading.

In 1939, Washington Times-Herald journalist Count Igor Cassini wrote a column piece that upset several members of Virginia high society. While covering a horse show in Warrenton, Cassini was kidnapped and tarred and feathered by three disgruntled individuals related to one mentioned in his column piece. Cassini was treated for burns at the Fauquier County Hospital in the early morning, with the three individuals being arrested and placed on probation.

In 1951, the federal government established the Warrenton Training Center just outside Warrenton. The center is a secret Central Intelligence Agency communications facility, which also houses an underground relocation bunker containing communications infrastructure to support continuity of government in the event of a nuclear attack on Washington, DC.

A bypass route around the town was built in the early 1960s, which attracted restaurants, gas stations, and shopping centers, but also drew businesses away from the center of town.

The Warrenton Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Other listings in or near Warrenton include Brentmoor, Dakota, Hopefield, Loretta, Monterosa, North Wales, The Oaks, the Old Fauquier County Jail, and Yorkshire House.

In 1998, Warrenton&#x27;s &quot;Black Horse&quot; chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected and dedicated a monument in the Warrenton Cemetery to 520 Confederate soldiers buried there, many of whom died during the First and Second Battles of Bull Run. This new monument altered a pre-existing Confederate obelisk built in 1877 by building a granite wall around the obelisk engraved with those 520 names. The then-mayor&#x27;s wife spearheaded fundraising for the monument from private organizations and the United Daughters of the Confederacy itself, of which she was a member. This monument still remains.

== Geography ==
Warrenton is located in central Fauquier County at (38.718307, −77.797085). U.S. Route 29 leads northeast to Gainesville and to Washington, D.C., and southwest to Culpeper. U.S. Route 15 follows US 29 out of town in both directions but leads north-northeast to Leesburg. U.S. Route 17 leads northwest to Winchester and southeast to Fredericksburg, and U.S. Route 211 leads west to Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Warrenton has a total area of , of which , or 0.13%, is water. The eastern, southern, and northern parts of the town drain east to Cedar Run, a tributary of the Occoquan River and part of the Potomac River watershed, while the western part of town drains south via Great Run to the Rappahannock River.

==Education==

=== Primary and secondary schools ===
Fauquier County Public Schools serves Warrenton. The elementary schools within the town serve Kindergarten to Fifth grades and consist of James G. Brumfield Elementary, Carson M. Bradley Elementary, and Peter. B. Smith Elementary.

The only public middle school that serves Warrenton is Taylor Middle School. Taylor Middle School serves grades six through eight. Warrenton Middle School was closed following the 2022–2023 school year and temporarily merged with Taylor Middle School during the construction of a new middle school also to be named Taylor Middle School.

The high school that serves Warrenton is Fauquier High School, which educates grades Nine through 12. The Fauquier County Public School system also operates an extremely small alternative learning school at Southwest Alternative School. This school serves both middle and high school students throughout the county, including Warrenton.

There are three private schools in the town of Warrenton: Highland School, St. John The Evangelist&#x27;s Catholic School, and St. James&#x27; Episcopal School.

=== Colleges and universities ===
The Fauquier campus of Laurel Ridge Community College resides just south of the town limits.

In 2022, Hazel Hall, a science, engineering and health professions building, was opened and construction begun on a Center for Skilled Trades.

=== Public libraries ===

The Fauquier Public Library&#x27;s Warrenton Library is located within the Warrenton Historic District. Despite being located within the town, the library is actually run by the county government&#x27;s Library Board. Each public school also has an internal library that students can access. Additionally, public bookcases adorn the town, often on the property of private citizens, acting in a manner similar to Little Free Library

== Arts and culture ==

Steeplechases have had a large impact on the culture within Fauquier County as well as the Town of Warrenton. This is largely due to the 1922 organization of the first Virginia Gold Cup race within the town. This event, along with the Maryland Hunt Cup, were two of the most prominent horse races at the time and remained prominent throughout the 20th century. Following the 1984 race, the event was moved to the nearby city, The Plains, where it has remained. The Virginia Gold Cup and International Gold Cup Race have drawn upwards of 50,000 attendees per year, assuring its cultural impact in the surrounding communities.

On the first Friday of each month between May and October, the Town of Warrenton hosts a themed street fair called &quot;First Friday&quot; within the Warrenton Historic District. Each month is typically themed to a different topic, affecting what local vendors and activities are available during the event.

The Town of Warrenton owns and operates four public parks and one recreation center.

Warrenton has several pieces of public art adorning the town. In 2001, watercolor painter Stewart Burgess White painted three murals on a single building depicting scenes from the American Civil War. Additionally, these murals included several hidden details such as faces of 19th century American leaders, references to the September 11 attacks, and the name of the painter&#x27;s daughter. Artists Ross Trimmer and Michael Broth collaborated on a mural that emulates classic large-letter postcards. In 2021, a group of local National Honor Society students from Kettle Run High School painted a small mural on a neglected wall lining a parking lot.

==Transportation==

Warrenton is served by four U.S. Routes; U.S. Route 15, U.S. Route 17, U.S. Route 29 (which collectively form the Eastern Bypass) and U.S. Route 211. US 15 extends north and south, heading towards Leesburg in the north and Orange to the south. US 17 is oriented northwest to southeast, connecting to Winchester to the northwest and Fredericksburg to the southeast. US 29 is oriented northeast to southwest, reaching Washington, D.C. to the northeast and Charlottesville to the southwest. Finally, US 211 begins north of the downtown area and extends westward, passing through Luray and the Shenandoah Valley. All four highways originally passed directly through the center of town and now follow bypasses. However, downtown Warrenton is now served by U.S Route 15 Business, U.S Route 17 Business, U.S Route 29 Business and U.S Route 211 Business.

Virginia Regional Transit operates the Circuit Rider bus in Warrenton. Academy Bus operates a commuter bus from Warrenton to Washington, D.C.

<text>Columbia, formerly known as Point of Fork, is an village and census designated place in Fluvanna County, Virginia, United States, at the confluence of the James and Rivanna rivers. Following a referendum, Columbia was dissolved as an incorporated town – until that time the smallest in Virginia – on July 1, 2016. As of the 2010 census, the town&#x27;s population was 83, up from 49 at the 2000 census.

Columbia is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In pre-colonial times, the site served as the location of Rassawek or Rassewek, the capital of what is now known as the Monacan Indian Nation. As of 2020, the historic remains of the Monacan settlement were under threat from a proposed water pumping station for the Cobb Creek Reservoir. The National Trust for Historic Preservation named it as one of America&#x27;s most endangered historic places.

English settlers who took over the land established a community called Point of Fork, in reference to the confluence of James and Rivanna rivers. During the Revolutionary War, a Patriot arsenal under the command of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben stood near Point of Fork. A detachment of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, composed of American Loyalists and commanded by Colonel John Graves Simcoe, were sent by Major General Charles Cornwallis to capture and confiscate the arsenal. Upon learning of Simcoe&#x27;s approach, von Steuben ordered his troops to transport the arsenal&#x27;s stores across the James; heavy artillery was dumped into the river to be recovered later. Simcoe captured the arsenal on June 5, 1781, and reported seizing a vast amount of Patriot supplies. However, von Steuben and General Lafayette reported that losses were negligible. 

The arsenal was rebuilt and supplied material to combat the Whiskey Rebellion and to aid the Battle of Fallen Timbers. It remained in service until 1801, when it was abandoned in favor of a more centralized arsenal, the Virginia Manufactory of Arms, located in Richmond.

Following the end of the war and the founding of the United States, the community changed its name to &quot;Columbia&quot; and became incorporated as a town in 1788. Columbia became a shipping point on the James River for Virginia&#x27;s tobacco trade, establishing its own bateau freight line. The confluence of the rivers at Columbia linked Richmond to Lynchburg through the James River and to Charlottesville through the Rivanna. In the mid-19th century, Columbia served as a point along the stagecoach route between Richmond and Staunton.

The town entered an economic decline with the end of passenger railroad service in 1958, and saw many homes and businesses destroyed in floods caused by Hurricanes Camille in 1969 and Agnes in 1972. In the decades afterward, conditions in the town worsened as buildings along its main street either burned down or became abandoned. In May 2014, Columbia&#x27;s mayor, John Hammond, and town council proposed disincorporation, which would result in the town being governed solely by Fluvanna County in exchange for financial aid. Despite efforts by historic preservationists to raise money for the town&#x27;s continued existence as an independent entity, residents voted to disincorporate in a referendum held on March 17, 2015. The Virginia General Assembly revoked Columbia&#x27;s town charter on March 3, 2016, via HB14 during the 2016 session. The disincorporation took effect on July 1, 2016.

===Shrine of St. Katharine Drexel===

Columbia is home to St. Joseph&#x27;s Church and Shrine of St. Katharine Drexel, a parish within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond. The church was built by William and Catherine Wakeham, English Catholic abolitionists who moved to Columbia in 1833. Because they were abolitionists, the hill on which their house was built came to be called Free Hill. After Catherine Wakeham&#x27;s death in 1891, her sons Alfred and Richard, both Josephites, were called away from Columbia for clerical duties. An elderly African-American man, Zack Kimbro, continued to maintain the chapel and place fresh flowers and clean linen on its altar.

St. Katharine Drexel, S.B.S. (1858–1955), the founder of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, visited the church while passing through Columbia in 1901 and noticed the reflection of sunlight on the chapel&#x27;s cross. St. Katherine was eventually introduced to Kimbro, who told her he had prayed daily for over a decade that Mass would once more be celebrated in the chapel. St. Katharine contacted the Josephite Fathers and arranged for Mass to be celebrated in the church&#x27;s chapel regularly. She also founded a small school adjacent to the chapel, which was one of Fluvanna County&#x27;s only educational institutions available for black children. St. Joseph&#x27;s and its school became the center of one of Virginia&#x27;s only historically African-American Catholic communities.

Because of its location on high ground, St. Joseph&#x27;s was spared during the 20th Century floods that mostly destroyed Columbia&#x27;s other buildings. The church is still an active parish, sharing a pastor with Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Palmyra. St. Joseph&#x27;s also serves Catholic students at the nearby Fork Union Military Academy.

<text>Rocky Mount is a town in and the county seat of Franklin County, Virginia, United States. The town is part of the Roanoke metropolitan area, and had a population of 4,903 as of the 2020 census. It is located in the Roanoke Region of Virginia.

==History==
Robert Hill built a block house (fortified residence and trading post) in the 1740s, for trading with Native Americans. English settlers did not arrive until 1760. They named Rocky Mount for a steep cliff near the town. The area originally consisted of two adjacent villages, Rocky Mount and Mount Pleasant.

Washington Iron Furnace was built by James Callaway and Jeremiah Early; its site was on what is now Main Street. It was operated by Callaway&#x27;s heirs and Peter Saunders until 1850, when it was damaged by a flood. Repairs and rebuilding were stopped by the breakout of Civil War.

The first court session was held at Rocky Mount in 1786 following the Revolutionary War. It was held in Callaway&#x27;s home until he deeded land to the town on which to build the courthouse. The first was made of logs. Rocky Mount was assigned a post office in 1795.

The town was divided into lots in 1804. Jeremiah&#x27;s son John Early represented the county (part-time) in the Virginia House of Delegates and served as sheriff. He operated a plantation nearby. The courthouse was replaced in 1831.

By 1836 the iron furnace employed 100 people. The town had about 275 residents; it had 30 houses and several businesses, including three grocery stores and a newspaper/printing office. The oldest dwelling is &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, built overlooking the courthouse in 1829 for Caleb Tate (the court clerk for nearly 40 years, from 1797-1835). Its detached brick kitchen, built circa 1820, is the oldest building in town. The Rocky Mount Turnpike Company incorporated in 1846 and a bank was founded shortly afterward, but neither prospered.

During the Civil War, numerous planter families from the Tidewater region sought refuge in Rocky Mount. Many brought numerous black American slaves with them, in part trying to ensure they did not escape to Union forces. Among these were the immediate past governor, Henry A. Wise, who settled his family here from his plantation on the Elizabeth River before he started serving as a Confederate general. Jubal Anderson Early, who became a Confederate general during the war, was born on a plantation nearby. Before the war, he served one term representing Franklin County in the Virginia House of Delegates and more than a decade as Commonwealth&#x27;s attorney (prosecutor). After the war, he resumed his legal practice here and in Lynchburg, Virginia. His office building in Rocky Mount was demolished in 1937.

One of the oldest buildings constructed in that era that still survives was built for Dr. Thomas Greer in 1861. Despite this, there are two older buildings constructed between 1850-1854, which are both still used as law offices to this day.

The town&#x27;s clerk, Robert A. Scott, issued scrip to assist families of Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. The Confederate government requisitioned slaves from various planters in the county to work on Richmond&#x27;s defenses. Rocky Mount had no battles, although Union Gen. George Stoneman and troops passed through the county in the war&#x27;s final days.

In 1867, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau under William F. DeKnight opened a Sunday school in Rocky Mount; about a third of the residents were black American freedmen. No day school was established for freedmen&#x27;s children until much later. Booker Taliaferro Washington was born enslaved in Franklin County. After the war, his mother moved with him to the free state of West Virginia for his education. He later studied at the Hampton Institute, established in eastern Virginia for the education of blacks.

The area&#x27;s major cash crop both before and after the Civil War was tobacco. In 1873, Rocky Mount incorporated as a town and absorbed the smaller village of Mount Pleasant, establishing its present boundaries. Former court clerk Robert Scott was elected as the first mayor.

Rocky Mount&#x27;s population was about 400 people in 1870, 600 in 1897, and about 1100 in 1920. In 1880, the Franklin and Pittsylvania Railroad connected Rocky Mount to Danville and Lynchburg via Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Most of the buildings in town burned in a destructive fire in 1889.

Another railroad was constructed through town about 1892, and stimulated industrial and commercial development. The railroad (known as the Norfolk and Western Railway) was nicknamed the &quot;Pumpkin Vine&quot; because of its route between Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Canadawas y Mills (a gristmill and box factory) was built in 1898.

Nathanial V. Angle, a former schoolteacher who became an entrepreneur, built the Bald Knob furniture factory in 1903. (It became the Lane Furniture Company in 1957 and is known as the MW Manufacturing Company in the 21st century). By World War I, N.V. Angle owned a furniture and grocery stores, a lumberyard, tobacco house, agricultural implement store, and the area&#x27;s first Ford automobile dealership.

Much of the town&#x27;s historic architecture, both residential and commercial, dates from the first decades of the 20th century. Only the Lodge Rooms (Colored), built in 1900, remains of the former thriving black American community on West Court Street. The furniture and textile workers needed housing, and contractors also built more elaborate (including Victorian-style) dwellings for managers and professionals. Rocky Mount is roughly halfway between Roanoke and Martinsville, Virginia, which likewise developed furniture manufacturing and textile industries early in the 20th century.

The present Franklin County courthouse was constructed in 1909 (two years after the Norfolk and Western freight and passenger station). It was modeled on the Roanoke County courthouse in Salem, Virginia.

The town&#x27;s growth was reflected in construction of new churches. Trinity Episcopal Church and its Rectory were both built in 1874 and survived the 1889 fire. The church was moved back from Main Street in 1906. The African Methodist Episcopal Church, built before the fire, no longer exists. The Presbyterian Church (built by 1880) reopened shortly after the fire. The Methodists rebuilt their church of brick; they replace Scott Memorial Church again in 1925. The Baptist Church (colored) built in 1907 was later deconsecrated and became a business. The Bethel AME church, built before World War I, continues to be in active use.

A Coca-Cola bottling plant opened in town circa 1920. The area&#x27;s oldest car dealership (Chevrolet) dates from 1926 (although housed in a building from 1916). Ryland Goode also established a car dealership for Dodges and Hudsons that year. The building for the International Harvester dealership dates from 1946; the John Deere dealership (built 1940) has been adapted for use as the county&#x27;s Developmental Center. New industries continued to be established before World War II. Around 1940 Sealtest established a dairy bottling plant and Exchange Milling opened an animal feed processing plant.

The Art Deco-style People&#x27;s National Bank was built in 1928.

Public schools were segregated, and those for black students were underfunded. In 1915, Rocky Mount appropriated $2,200 to build an eight-room brick school for white students, complete with central heating and indoor plumbing. The same year black residents built Rocky Mount Colored School and dormitory, at their own expense, on Bald Knob outside the town limits. The town became a school district and in 1924 built a high school for white students. By 1940 the town&#x27;s white students had 16 teachers.

Only seven black American teachers &quot;struggled with the problems of their race in their own schools.&quot; Around that time, a foundation was established to mark Booker T. Washington&#x27;s birthplace. In 1952 it donated 6 acres of land on which to build a modern, four-room school for black students. That opened shortly before the start of Massive Resistance to school desegregation in Virginia. It was operated until 1966, when the U.S. Supreme Court found subsidies for segregated schools (much used by the county&#x27;s white schoolchildren) to be unconstitutional. This structure has been adapted for use as an administrative building of the National Park Service.

Rocky Mount&#x27;s brick Municipal Building was built in 1929. The Works Progress Administration of the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration built the United States Post Office in 1936, during the Great Depression. The county jail was built in the Art Moderne style in 1938, also a depression project.

Investment in infrastructure was increased by the federal government. The town applied for funds to upgrade its sewer system. The New Deal project with most effects may have been work on U.S. Route 220 and state route 40 near the town. The WPA and prominent local businessman N. V. Angle drained a swamp and developed the land for Mary Elizabeth Park, named for Angle&#x27;s wife. It is now maintained by the local Presbyterian church (although Angle was a Methodist).

Before World War II, Rocky Mount&#x27;s industries included a silk mill and a door and sash window factory, in addition to Angle&#x27;s furniture company.

The library, constructed in 1940, was one of ten funded by an anonymous donor in rural Virginia counties in that era. It now serves as an administration building. The county&#x27;s administration building, built in 1967, is along the same street and is named for Virgil Goode Sr., former Virginia House delegate and Commonwealth&#x27;s attorney. In 1990, local residents saved the former Norfolk and Western station. It has been redeveloped as a tourist information center.

The Booker T. Washington National Monument, Evergreen-Callaway-Deyerle House, The Farm, Greer House, Rocky Mount Historic District, Washington Iron Furnace, and Woods-Meade House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Middletown is a town in Frederick County, Virginia, United States, in the northern Shenandoah Valley. The population was 1,265 at the 2010 census, up from 1,015 at the 2000 census.

== History ==

Middletown was chartered on May 4, 1796. Some of the first documentation of early Middletown dates back to the late 18th century and is attributed to Dr. Peter Senseney and his wife Magdelen, two German settlers who had migrated from Pennsylvania. The town was originally known as &quot;Senseney Town&quot;, a piece of land within the 17th century Fairfax Grant and gifted to the allies for siding with England during the civil war in the 1600s.

Belle Grove Plantation, about a mile southwest of Middletown, was first settled in about 1750, and its historic Federal-style manor house was completed in 1797. Middletown was the site of numerous military operations in the American Civil War including the Battle of Cedar Creek, fought just south of the town. The area where this battle occurred has been protected as part of the Cedar Creek and Belle Grove National Historical Park. Because the town was founded long before the Civil War, its antebellum history is extensive, as evidenced by the fact that Middletown&#x27;s Wayside Inn purports to be the longest continuously running inn in America. Wayside Theatre, also located in Middletown, was one of Virginia&#x27;s oldest professional live theaters (opened 1963, closed 2013). The town is home to Laurel Ridge Community College.

In addition to Belle Grove Plantation, Long Meadow, the Middletown Historic District, Fort Bowman, Monte Vista, Old Forge Farm, and St. Thomas Chapel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012 the town of Middletown elected the youngest mayor in Virginia history at the age of 24, Charles Hamilton Harbaugh IV. He was reelected in 2016.

<text>Stephens City ( ) is an incorporated town in the southern part of Frederick County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 2,016 at the time of the 2020 census, and an estimated population of 2,096 in 2022. Founded by Peter Stephens in the 1730s, the colonial town was chartered and named for Lewis Stephens (Peter&#x27;s only son) in October 1758. It was originally settled by German Protestants from Heidelberg.

Stephens City is the second-oldest municipality in the Shenandoah Valley after nearby Winchester, which is about to the north. &quot;Crossroads&quot;, the first free black community in the Valley in the pre-Civil War years, was founded east of town in the 1850s. Crossroads remained until the beginning of the Civil War when the freed African Americans either escaped or were recaptured. Stephens City was saved from intentional burning in 1864 by Union Major Joseph K. Stearns. The town has gone through several name changes in its history, starting as &quot;Stephensburg&quot;, then &quot;Newtown&quot;, and finally winding up as &quot;Stephens City&quot;, though it nearly became &quot;Pantops&quot;. Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11 pass close to and through the town, respectively.

A large section of the center of the town, including buildings and homes, covering , is part of the Newtown–Stephensburg Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Stephens City celebrated its 250th anniversary on October 12, 2008. The town is a part of the Winchester, Virginia-West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area, an offshoot of the Washington–Baltimore–Northern Virginia, DC–MD–VA–WV Combined Statistical Area. It is a member of the Winchester–Frederick County Metropolitan Planning Organization.

==History==

===Founding and early days===
The area surrounding present-day Stephens City was originally inhabited for 12,000 years by Native Americans, including the Susquehannock, Lenape, Tuscarora, Catawba, Iroquois, and Cherokee. One of the largest groups, the Shawnee, had already left the area when European settlement began. The tribes that did remain were initially peaceful towards the settlers, but relations soured after resources and land were confiscated. The ancestors of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, received a land grant from King Charles II of England which included a large portion of modern Virginia. After discovering one of the grant&#x27;s boundaries, the Potomac River, extended into the Alleghany Mountains and that others had also received grants west of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a compromise was reached whereby these grant holders would keep their land. One of these grants, named the King&#x27;s Grants, was acquired in 1730 by John and Isaac Vanmeter from Governor Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet. The Vanmeter grant was purchased by Baron Jost Hite the following year.

Hite, a wealthy Protestant immigrant from Strasburg, Germany, had settled in Kensington, New York, before moving to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In 1732, Hite, his three sons-in-law, and a dozen other German and Scotch-Irish families moved south and settled along Opequon Creek, the present site of the John Hite House. One of the men who had traveled with Hite, Peter Stephens, received a land grant of and settled further south where he built a log house. Stephens was also a German Protestant and had immigrated from Heidelberg.

Peter&#x27;s house was built on the north side of Crooked Run, later renamed Stephens Run. Peter, his wife, Mary (Maria Christen Rittenhouse), and their children were soon joined by others who built homes in the surrounding area. The oldest Stephens child, Ludwig (Lewis), was by that time an adult and operated a tavern at the family homestead. In the 1740s and 1750s, Lewis acquired land from Hite, Fairfax, and Peter Rittenhouse. His land holding was expanded to in 1755 when Peter conveyed to Lewis.

During the French and Indian War, Lewis made plans to establish a town, citing the need for a central area where locals could gather to defend themselves from possible attack. In 1754 Lewis began laying out the town, composed of 80 0.5-acre (0.2 ha) lots and 60 1-acre (0.4 ha) lots. On September 21, 1758, Lewis petitioned the colonial government of Virginia in Williamsburg for a town charter. The Virginia General Assembly approved the charter for the town of &quot;Stephensburgh&quot; on October 12, 1758, making it the second oldest town in Frederick County. Among the town&#x27;s 900 acres, a market house, common, and three town wells were platted. The mostly German-speaking residents soon left off the &quot;h&quot; in Stephensburgh; the town was usually spelled &quot;Stephensburg&quot;. By the start of the Revolutionary War, Stephensburg was often called simply &quot;New Town&quot; or &quot;Newtown&quot;, as the new settlement on the Great Wagon Road south of Winchester. During the war, local patriots who fought for the Continental Army included Gabriel Stephens, one of Peter Stephens&#x27; grandsons, who was captured at Fort Washington along with other Newtown soldiers.

Newtown continued to grow after the war, and by the 1790s, the town limits were expanded north and Newtown&#x27;s first post office opened. Shenandoah Valley and Newtown&#x27;s central location at the intersection of the Valley Pike and a route connecting Alexandria with the Cumberland Gap, today&#x27;s Route 277, attracted heavy traffic through the region, and wagon-making emerged as an important industry for the town. Local artisans operated over a dozen wagonmaking shops in Newtown, supplying wagons throughout the state. By 1830, the town&#x27;s population had reached 800. In 1853, free African Americans began a settlement about a mile east of town near the intersection of present-day Route 277 and Double Church Road which became known as &quot;Crossroads&quot; or &quot;Freetown&quot;, which lasted until after the Civil War. After the January 1, 1863, Emancipation Proclamation, some of the newly freed slaves worked for Union commanders and many of the already free African Americans left the area.

When the Civil War broke out in 1861, the majority of Newtown&#x27;s young men joined Confederate forces. During the war, the town was &quot;between the lines&quot;, nominally controlled by the Union but with much Confederate partisan activity. On May 24, 1862, Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Confederate forces advanced northward on the Valley Pike and attacked Union troops, who were retreating at the time. At Newtown, General George Henry Gordon of the Second Massachusetts Infantry ordered his Federal troops to make a stand. The skirmishing involved heavy artillery fire, but Gordon&#x27;s men retreated without loss of the important supply wagons. When Gordon left the town to Jackson&#x27;s forces, both sides claimed a victory. Throughout the day control of the town changed hands six times between Union and Confederate forces.

In June 1864, Major Joseph K. Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry arrived under orders to burn the town down to help stop Confederate ambushes on the wagon road. Because the remaining population mostly consisted of women, children and the elderly, Stearns allowed the town to stand. He required the adult residents to take the &quot;Ironclad oath&quot;, in which they swore that they had not voluntarily provided aid to the Confederacy. The government required the oath, effectively excluding ex-Confederates from the political arena during the Reconstruction era.

In April 1867, the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter to the Winchester and Strasburg Railroad Company. The company was authorized to construct a rail line between Winchester and Strasburg, linking Newtown to the rest of the nation by railroad for the first time. Though the railroad improved the local economy, which had lagged after the end of the war, it decimated the wagon-building trade. In 1880, the United States Post Office Department, faced with nearly a dozen Newtowns in Virginia, announced that the local post office would be renamed &quot;Pantops&quot;. This was changed to &quot;Newtonfield&quot; 16 days later. Dissatisfied with both names, the townsfolk chose &quot;Stephens City&quot;.

===20th century to present===

In the early 1900s limestone was discovered on the western side of Stephens City. Soon after a lime plant built by the M. J. Grove Lime Company began operations, near the Stephens City Station railway depot and the Stephens City Milling Company. This industrial area, nicknamed &quot;Mudville&quot;, would later expand to include commercial businesses. The 20th century brought improvements to energy and domestic systems: electrical service was introduced in 1915; and in 1941, just before World War II, the town installed a water system. Passenger service at the train station ended in 1949. This event, along with the effects of a devastating 1936 fire that destroyed or damaged most of the buildings in Mudville, resulted in the demise of that part of town.

The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic through the center of town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81, attracting commuters to purchase homes. In 1964, the town&#x27;s sewer system and the only stoplight in the town limits were both installed. A permanent town hall opened in 1978.

The town surveyed its older buildings to establish architectural significance and to determine those that contributed to the town&#x27;s historic center. The Newtown–Stephensburg Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1992. Among the contributing properties to the historic district are numerous 18th-century buildings, 19th-and-early-20th century homes and businesses, cemeteries, churches, and a school complex.

Virginia school systems had practiced massive resistance following the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. The United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered Frederick County schools desegregated (including those serving Stephens City) in &quot;Brown v. County School Board&quot; (1964). In 1994, Virgil E. Watson was elected as the first African American to serve on the Stephens City Town Council. Watson served for one term, from 1994 until 1998.

In 2003, the lime plant closed, ending around 100 years of limestone production and processing in Stephens City. On September 17, 2004, remnants of Hurricane Ivan spawned an F1 tornado that touched down just south of the town along Interstate 81. It caused approximately $1 million in damage and injured two people. It was one of a record 40 tornadoes to hit northern Virginia that day. Renovation of the town&#x27;s historic center has attracted heritage tourism. Anticipating more growth, the town annexed of unincorporated Frederick County in 2005, another in 2006, and in 2007. The town celebrated its 250th anniversary on October 12, 2008. During the late 2010s and early 2020s, property developments added hundreds of new homes to the town. In 2022 voters overwhelmingly approved a bond measure to rehabilitate and renovate the town&#x27;s former school complex into a new town hall and community space.

==Culture==
===Parks and recreation===
Town residents have access to two parks within town limits: Newtown Commons and Bel Air Street Park. Newtown Commons, sometimes called Newtown Park, is located along Main Street, and the other is on Bel Air Street. At Newtown Commons, residents can hold outdoor events such as picnics, fundraisers or small concerts. The Bel Air Street Park is a playground for children with standard swingsets and other activities.

Just outside Stephens City is Sherando Park. The park houses several trails, ponds, a pool, sports fields and more. Sherando Park is also home of the Virginia Tech Memorial Garden, planted in memory of the Virginia Tech shooting, which took place approximately from the park. It has &quot;a winding sidewalk shaped in the college&#x27;s trademark &#x27;VT&#x27;&quot; and &quot;a flagpole surrounded by 32 Hokie Stones&quot;, one for each of the 32 victims of the shooting. The Memorial Garden was dedicated and opened on April 16, 2009, the second anniversary of the shooting. The park was built by the Shenandoah Chapter of Virginia Tech Alumni Association, which is based in nearby Winchester, Virginia.

The Family Drive-In Theatre, a two-screen drive-in theater, is located near the town, on U.S. Route 11 just south of Stephens City. It is one of ten drive-ins in the state of Virginia. The theatre converted to all-digital in 2013.

===Annual events===
Stephens City plays host to the annual &quot;Newtown Heritage Festival&quot; held each Memorial Day weekend. The three-day event features many crafts, carnival-style food, a tractor wagon ride through town, local music at Newtown Commons, a parade on Saturday and fireworks. Stephens City is one of the towns along the Route 11 Yard Crawl. A yearly event held during the second Saturday in August, the Yard Crawl is an almost yard sale that stretches from Stephens City&#x27;s Newtown Commons south along U.S. Route 11 to New Market, Virginia. The event is sponsored by the Shenandoah County Chamber Advisory Group, five chambers of commerce, and the town of Stephens City.

===Religion===

The earliest organized religious congregation in Stephens City was a Reformed church that met in a log cabin. Lutherans began worshipping together in the town in 1770. The two congregations shared use of the log cabin beginning in 1786. Services were conducted in German until the 1820s, reflecting the heritage of the town&#x27;s early founders. The log cabin was replaced in 1812 with a brick building, which was later expanded in 1851. The current Trinity Lutheran Church was built in 1906 and incorporates some of the material from the previous structure.

Methodism arrived in Stephens City in 1775 and the first Methodist society west of the Blue Ridge Mountains was established. Some of the earliest members of the Methodist congregation were members of the Stephens and Hite families. During the congregation&#x27;s early years, members would often meet in homes. Lewis Stephens donated land for a permanent meeting place, and in 1790, a log cabin that Francis Asbury described as a &quot;spacious chapel&quot; was built. In 1827, the congregation replaced the log cabin with a brick building that was used until 1882. The current Stephens City United Methodist Church was built in 1913.

The oldest surviving church building in the town is Orrick Chapel, built between 1866 and 1869 as the home of an African Methodist Episcopal congregation. Missionaries from this first independent black denomination came South after the war to aid freedmen and plant new congregations; they attracted hundreds of thousands of new members. This church replaced an earlier Methodist chapel constructed in the late 1850s; it was razed by Union troops during the winter months of 1864–1865 near the end of the Civil War. Two other black churches in Stephens City are a nondenominational congregation which meets in a former Baptist church built in 1891, and a Full Gospel congregation which meets in a former Free Will Baptist church, also built in 1891.

Just south of the town limits is a Mennonite church. Further south is a Unitarian Universalist church. A Roman Catholic parish affiliated with the Diocese of Arlington and a Jewish synagogue, which each function as centers for their respective members in the entire Shenandoah Valley, are located approximately north in Winchester.

==Government==

The town is led by a Mayor, currently Mike Diaz, who was elected in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. The representative body of Stephens City is known as the Town Council, whose elected members include Linden A. Fravel Jr., who also serves as Vice Mayor, Regina Swygert-Smith, Pete Fravel, Mariah Smith, Tina Stevens and Ronald Bowers. The Town Manager is Mike Majher, who also serves as the Town Planner. Other administrative staff working for the town government include the Town Clerk (Kelly Thatcher) and Town Treasurer (Steve Rickards).

The town is served by Police Chief William &quot;Bill&quot; Copp and Fire &amp; EMS Chief Timothy J. Vaught, both of whom are on the town&#x27;s Public Safety Committee. The town is served by five other committees: the Administrative Committee, the Personnel Committee, the Water and Sewer Committee, the Public Works Committee, and the Finance Committee. The members of those five committees are composed of Town Council members. The town&#x27;s Planning Commission reviews proposed changes to land use, including zoning and property development. The town&#x27;s Historic Preservation Commission reviews proposals for new buildings and alterations to existing structures.

Stephens City is represented by Chris Collins (Republican) in the Virginia House of Delegates 29th District. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Republican) represents the town in the Virginia Senate&#x27;s 27th District. The town is represented by Bill Wiley (Republican) in the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia&#x27;s 6th district. Tim Kaine (Democrat) and Mark Warner (Democrat) represent the town in the United States Senate.

==Education==
Frederick County Public Schools operate the public schools that serve Stephens City, although none are located within Stephens City proper; public schools that serve Stephens City are within a few miles of the town limits. The town and surrounding area are served by Bass-Hoover Elementary School, Robert E. Aylor Middle School (in nearby White Post), and Sherando High School. The latter was named for one of the historic Iroquoian-speaking tribes encountered by early European settlers to the Shenandoah Valley. Eukarya Christian Academy and Legacy Christian Academy are two private schools located outside the town&#x27;s corporate limits. The two local options for residents wishing to obtain degrees in higher education are Shenandoah University in Winchester and Laurel Ridge Community College in Middletown.

==Media==
From 1881 to 1883, Stephens City had a community newspaper, the &quot;Stephens City Star&quot;. During its short history, it was led by three editors: Charles E. Painter, S. M. Stickley, and Ben S. Gilmore. Since 1896, the town and surrounding area have been covered by &quot;The Winchester Star&quot;. Another regional newspaper, &quot;The Northern Virginia Daily&quot;, is based in nearby Strasburg. Other regional news outlets include the &quot;Warren/Frederick County Report&quot; and the &quot;Royal Examiner&quot;.&quot;&quot;

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Historic U.S. Route 11 (Main Street) traverses Stephens City proper, while Interstate 81 is located immediately east of the town line. Stephens City serves as the western terminus of State Route 277 (Fairfax Street), which begins at U.S. Route 11 and ends only away in Double Tollgate, Clarke County, Virginia, at U.S. Routes 340 and 522. In addition to Main Street, the major north–south streets in town are Barley Drive, German Street, and Mulberry Street. The major streets running east–west other than Fairfax Street are Locust Street, School Street, and Short Street/Steele Court.

Plans are in place to move State Route 277 to near the Family Drive-In Theatre, south of its current western terminus with US Route 11, with the eastern terminus remaining at its current location. The planned construction will also move the I-81 interchange at Stephens City, where there are a number of service stations and fast food restaurants, south of the town limits to alleviate congestion on the current Route 277 bridge, which will remain after construction is completed. Planners expect expansion of Stephens City to the south.

There are no public transportation options in Stephens City, but officials plan to create a system of bicycle trails and sidewalks, including a connection to Sherando Park and other areas east of Interstate 81. The nearest train station is the Martinsburg station in Martinsburg, West Virginia, which is serviced by Amtrak intercity rail and Marc commuter rail. Winchester Regional Airport is mostly used for general aviation. The nearest major airport is Dulles International Airport, approximately one hour east of Stephens City.

<doc id="137620" wikidata="Q1373463" url="?curid=137620" title="Fries, Virginia">
<text>Fries (pronounced &quot;freeze&quot;) is an incorporated town located on the New River in Grayson County, Virginia, 15.5 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of the county seat in Independence — in Virginia&#x27;s Blue Ridge Highlands and on Virginia&#x27;s musical heritage trail, The Crooked Road.

Named after prominent cotton mill owner, Francis Henry Fries, the town is noted as the former site of Washington Mill (1903-1989); as one of three end points of the New River Trail State Park and as the host of annual music festivals reflecting its strong bluegrass and country music traditions — with its August &quot;Old-Time Fiddlers&#x27; and Bluegrass Convention&quot; and its September &quot;Festival by the New River&quot;.

==History==
Fries was named after North Carolina cotton mill owner Colonel Francis Henry Fries. Jim &#x27;Pipe&#x27; Carico (of Stephens Creek, Virginia, the nearest incorporated town) contacted Fries in 1900 and proposed Bartlett Falls on New River as a site for a hydroelectric dam that could power a cotton mill.

Fries purchased the surrounding rural farmland then hired a local labor force to build a dam, a cotton mill and a full-service company owned town. By 1901, the New River Train was extended to the mill site and Fries petitioned the Virginia State Legislature to incorporate the new town of Carico, VA in honor of Jim &#x27;Pipe&#x27; Carico. For reasons that are not well documented, the town name was instead legislatively changed to Fries, Virginia and officially incorporated in 1902.

Despite the heavy reliance on manual labor, mules and oxen, the town&#x27;s construction progressed quickly and the open call for employment spurred migration to the town. Around 300 houses, a post office, a church and a company commissary were wedged into the surrounding hillside before the mill began operation in February 1903 — with &quot;the most sophisticated technology in the world.&quot;

After changing hands numerous times, the mill closed in 1989. At the time the mill closed, it employed 1,700 people.

Fries High School also closed in 1989. The students from Fries, along with students from nearby Independence High School, were combined to form Grayson County High School, located in Independence.

The Stephen G. Bourne House, Fries Boarding Houses, and Spring Valley Rural Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Culture ==
Although the entire Appalachian region is known for its Bluegrass and traditional, or &quot;old-timey&quot; music and musicians, the region around Mount Airy, North Carolina is one of the few areas of the United States where this music has remained prominent, even among young people. The Old Fiddler&#x27;s Convention, one of the most prominent traditional music contests in the United States, has been held annually in the nearby city of Galax since 1935. It has long attracted the best up-and-coming bluegrass musicians. The Blue Ridge Music Center with its amphitheater and music museum of old-time music is just a short distance away on the Blue Ridge Parkway at Milepost 213 (kilometer 342.8).

==Recreation==
New River Trail State Park, a rail trail park has a 5.5 spur from Fries Junction on the main trail to Fries, Virginia — giving Fries one of its three end points.

The historic Fries Recreation Center is located in downtown Fries.

In 1910 an increasing need was seen for a community center for the employees of the mill. A site was selected that would be central for the townspeople and construction was begun for the Fries Lyceum.

The building provided reading rooms, and a skating rink became the gathering place for the young people of the town. In 1923, the Lyceum was renovated and reorganized as a Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA). The building now contained the only
gymnasium in the Carroll-Grayson area, along with a movie theatre. The need to expand was seen again in the late 1940s, and in 1948, a new lobby, bowling alley, kitchen and dining area, library, and additional game rooms were added. The swimming pool built in the front, facing the New River, was the most popular addition.

Through the years semi-professional baseball was sponsored by the &quot;Y&quot;. It has housed meetings for the Fries Garden Club, organized in 1932, Fries Lions Club organized in 1938, and the Fries Women&#x27;s Club organized in 1953.

The Fries Recreation center hosts The Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of the USA, Red Cross Training Courses, Hunter Safety Courses, visiting community minded college students, and many more groups and activities.

The Fries Recreation Center also houses the Fries Town Hall and the Fries Police Department

<text>Independence is a town located in and the county seat of Grayson County, Virginia. At the 2020 U.S. census, it had a population of 1,001. It is situated on Virginia&#x27;s Crooked Road, a heritage trail celebrating the musical heritage of Southwest Virginia.

The town and county are noted for the original red brick 1908 Courthouse at the corner of Main Street (Virginia Route 58) and Independence Avenue (US 21), site of the annual &quot;July 4th Celebration&quot; and autumn &quot;Mountain Foliage Festival.&quot;

In 2021, the town created its first public park in its 115 year history, Town Park, on vacant property opposite the original Courthouse.

Town park is home to the &quot;Independence Farmers Market&quot;, which opens weekly from May–October and online year round. The market uses a timber-frame, white oak, pavilion completed in 2021 in collaboration with the Timber Framers Guild. Remaining work includes bathrooms, utilities and sitework — as well as a stage. The stage hosts Farmers Market as well as Crooked Road events and is named the &quot;Uncle Wade Old Time Stage&quot;, after noted musician and Independence native, Wade Ward.

==History==
The Brookside Farm and Mill and the original Grayson County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Courthouse features a Richardsonian style by noted architect Frank Pierce Milburn following his designs Wise County, Virginia, and Forsyth County, North Carolina, and the Southern Railway Station in Knoxville, Tennessee. The design features corbeled brackets and a Flemish gable between octagonal corner towers with roof element. A horizontal course and a cornice wrap the building to a central portico. Some brick from an 1863 courthouse previously occupying the site was re-used as fill inside the walls, with remaining brick arriving from Maysville, Kentucky, rail-shipped to Fries, Virginia, and delivered by ox drawn wagon to Independence. Office furniture was purchased from Richmond. To safely store county documents — birth, marriage, property, and death records — the building included a state-mandated fireproof vault.

The county constructed a new courthouse in the 1970s, and the 1908 building was nearly razed after left vacant in 1981, badly in disrepair. Rescued by citizens groups — Grayson County Historical Society and a grass-roots group, People and the Courthouse (PATCH) — and restored. A local businessman, Dan Doyle Baldwin (1933-1994, CEO of Nautilus Fitness) purchased and restored the building, in turn donating it on July 4, 1986 to Grayson County and forming the &quot;Historic 1908 Courthouse Foundation.&quot; The courthouse now serves as the Grayson County Art &amp; Cultural Center. &quot;The Grayson Crossroads Museum&quot; is now located on the first floor in what was the Clerk&#x27;s Vault Room and the building accommodates special events and community activities. Open to the public, the Baldwin Auditorium occupies the former courtroom. The 1908 Courthouse is now featured prominently on the Grayson County logo. A carrara marble Confederate Monument, titled “Parade Rest”, was dedicated in 1911, remaining in place as of 2022.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, Independence was home to the Nautilus Fitness manufacturing plant and warehouse at a 56 acre site 709 Powerhouse Road, reaching a peak of 600 employees in 1984. One of Grayson County&#x27;s major industries, Nautilus was sold to Bowflex in 1997. The plant remains, currently owned by Medfit Systems.

<text>South Boston, formerly Boyd&#x27;s Ferry, is a town in Halifax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 8,142 at the 2010 census, down from 8,491 at the 2000 census. It is the most populous town in Halifax County.

== History ==




On December 8, 1796, the Virginia General Assembly authorized eight commissioners to establish at Boyd&#x27;s Ferry on the south side of the Dan River the town of South Boston, named for Boston, Massachusetts. Because this site proved vulnerable to flooding, it was eventually abandoned in favor of a new settlement on the north side. By the 1850s the Richmond and Danville Railroad passed through South Boston, which eventually developed into an important market for brightleaf tobacco. In 1884 it was incorporated as a town; in 1960 it became an independent city; and in 1995 it made history by being the first city in Virginia to revert to town status and rejoined Halifax County.

Within the town limits Berry Hill Plantation, E. L. Evans House, Reedy Creek Site, South Boston Historic District, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fourqurean House, Glennmary, Glenwood, Tarover, and Seaton are nearby.

South Boston was home to the National Tobacco Festival (a typically three day annual festival held every Fall) from its inception in 1935 to 1941, when it was suspended during World War II. In 1948, the festival was moved to Richmond, Virginia when it outgrew the town. It was held in Richmond until 1984, when it was canceled due to rising production costs and decreased interest. South Boston was the second largest producer of tobacco in the United States until the Great Depression.

==Geography==
South Boston is located south of the center of Halifax County at (36.707722, −78.903388). It is bordered to the south by the unincorporated community of Riverdale. U.S. Route 501 passes through the center of the town, leading north to Halifax, the county seat, and south to Roxboro, North Carolina. U.S. Route 360 crosses the southeast corner of the town limits, leading northeast to Keysville and west to Danville. U.S. Route 58 passes through the southernmost part of South Boston with US 360, leading west with it to Danville but running east to South Hill.

<text>Ashland is a town in Hanover County, Virginia, United States, located north of Richmond along Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 7,565, up from 7,225 at the 2010 census.

Ashland is named after the Lexington, Kentucky estate of Hanover County native and statesman Henry Clay. It is the only incorporated town in Hanover County. Although comprising only one square mile when originally incorporated in 1858, today Ashland has grown through several annexations to a size of .

==History==
The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad initially developed the town in the 1840s as a mineral springs resort with a racetrack. The town was named &quot;Ashland&quot; after native son Henry Clay&#x27;s estate in Kentucky and was officially incorporated on February 19, 1858. The area had been known as &quot;The Slashes&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;swamp&quot;, but which also reflected the small ravines that formed in the sandy clay soil after hard rains.

Confederate troops trained on the former racetrack early in the American Civil War, but the war and its aftermath devastated Ashland. Randolph–Macon College (founded 1830) moved to Ashland in 1868 and began using buildings of the bankrupt hotel as well as building additional structures.

The railroad lines rebuilt and the town continued to expand. Even before the war, the railroad began offering monthly passes to Richmond to people buying lots and building houses in Ashland. When tycoon Jay Gould established an electrified interurban line between Ashland and Richmond in 1907, the town became an early streetcar suburb of Richmond. The Richmond and Chesapeake Bay Railway, as it came to be called, was abandoned in 1938. A former car barn in Ashland is one of the few remaining vestiges of the line.

Construction of U.S. Route 1 on the former Washington (or Richmond) Road, and later I-95, further shaped the town character and development.

One of Virginia&#x27;s oldest churches is southeast of Ashland: Slash Church, built as the Upper Church of St. Paul&#x27;s Parish in 1729 remains a house of worship, though now used by the Disciples of Christ. Ashland itself originally had a Free Church, shared by various Protestant denominations. Several denominations built churches shortly after the Civil War, but many have been torn down. The town&#x27;s current Episcopal church is St. James the Less, on the other side of the railway line from Slash Church and whose congregation received monthly clergy visitations in the 1850s, and which in 1958 sold its 1866-consecrated and once-moved building as well as the old rectory (which still remains today, in private ownership) in order to build a larger one on the town&#x27;s outskirts. The Disciples of Christ also had a historic church on Center Street (built 1900) that was replaced in 1985. Historic churches still within the town&#x27;s (and historic district&#x27;s) boundaries include Ashland Baptist Church (1860, now the Hanover Arts and Activities Center); Shiloh Baptist Church (1866, originally Freedmens Baptist Church), Duncan Memorial Chapel (Methodist, 1879), St. Ann&#x27;s Catholic Church (built 1892, remodeled 1925) and Ashland Presbyterian Church (1875-1881). Gwathmey Baptist Church (1892) is a mile nearer Richmond and (like the former St. James the Less Church), within 50 feet of the railroad tracks. The town now also has an Eastern Orthodox congregation, St. Andrew&#x27;s (2001), and a messianic Jewish congregation (Beth Shalom Ministries, 2004).
On October 19, 2002, Ashland made national news as the site of one of the D.C. sniper attacks. 37-year-old Jeffrey Hopper was shot at 8:00 pm in the parking lot of a Ponderosa Steakhouse as he and his wife left the restaurant. A ransom demand note the snipers left nearby was instrumental in identifying them.

The local newspaper, &quot;The Herald-Progress&quot;, published its final edition on March 29, 2018.

==Geography==
Ashland is located near the center of Hanover County at (37.759361, −77.477226). U.S. Route 1 passes through the east side of the center of town, leading north to Doswell and south to Richmond. Interstate 95 passes through the town limits further to the east, with access from Exit 92. I-95 leads north to Fredericksburg and to Washington, D.C., while to the south it leads 16 miles to Richmond and to Petersburg. Virginia State Route 54 goes through the center of Ashland as England Street and Thompson Street, leading east to U.S. Route 301 at Hanover, the county seat, and northwest to Montpelier.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Ashland has a total area of , of which , or 0.43%, are water. Ashland is drained to the north by tributaries of the South Anna River, part of the Pamunkey and York River watershed, and to the south by tributaries of the Chickahominy River, part of the James River watershed.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cold winters. Average monthly temperatures range from 36.4 °F in January to 77.4 °F in July. The hardiness zone is 7a.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 7,565 people with 2,660 households in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 64.2% White, 21.6% African American, 0.5% Native American, 1.2% Asian, and 4.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.5% of the population.

The median income for a household in the town was $55,521. The per capita income for the town was $26,227. About 16.9% of the population were below the poverty line.

==Public services==
Ashland is governed by a five-member town council, and day-to-day activities are run by a town manager, appointed by the town council. Hanover County handles stormwater pollutant removal and filtration. The town&#x27;s library is part of the multi-county Pamunkey Regional Library System, although additional libraries are at the courthouse and Randolph Macon College.

The Ashland Volunteer Fire Company, formed in 1890, is located on 501 Archie Canon Drive. Hanover County Fire-EMS now provides 24/7 career staffing from this station and is supplemented by volunteers. The Ashland Police Department has 25 sworn full-time officers and is Law Enforcement Accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA).

==Transportation==
Ashland&#x27;s major highway connection is to I-95 at exit 92, via Virginia State Route 54. Commercial airline service is provided at Richmond International Airport, distant, and general aviation is served by Hanover County Municipal Airport, south of downtown.

Ashland&#x27;s railroad station is served by Amtrak &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains bound for Richmond, Newport News and Norfolk, as well as points north such as Washington, D.C., and beyond on the Northeast Corridor to Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Other Amtrak long-distance trains, such as the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Auto Train&quot; to Florida, pass through Ashland without stopping on the CSX railroad&#x27;s double-track mainline that bisects the downtown business district. As those trains approach Ashland, onboard announcers point out the Randolph–Macon College campus and the houses and businesses facing the tracks.

Proposals in the 2016 &quot;DC2RVA&quot; study to improve rail service between Washington, D.C., and Richmond by expanding the existing double-track railroad to triple-track have prompted concerns about its impact on the prized ambiance of downtown Ashland. The Main Street merchants&#x27; association said at a hearing that the additional track would result in &quot;incalculable” loss to the city&#x27;s &quot;charm, the quaintness, and the aesthetic values&quot;.

==Local attractions and events==
Ashland&#x27;s tourist information center is located at the Ashland railroad station. &quot;Bloomberg Business&quot; in 2009 named Ashland &quot;Best Place to Raise your Kids&quot; in Virginia. In 2014, Movoto.com named Ashland one of America&#x27;s 10 best small towns.

Pufferbelly Park, located behind the Ashland Police Department, features playground facilities and the town&#x27;s public skatepark, which opened in 2004.

For nearly 35 years, Ashland&#x27;s main festival has been the &quot;Strawberry Faire&quot; in June, at which vendors from around the state sell a variety of different items (with a strawberry theme). Festivities include a Strawberry Faire Pageant for Little Miss and Mister Strawberry, as well as live performances by local artists. Ten Hanover County Schools students each year receive Strawberry Faire scholarships.

The &quot;Ashland Musical Variety Show&quot; is a biennial talent show held in odd years. It features songs and skits performed by area residents and raises funds for the Hanover Arts &amp; Activities Center in Ashland. It started in 1982.

Another festival is the family-friendly annual &quot;Ashland Train Day&quot; on the last Saturday in April. Vendors can be found from around the country up and down Railroad Avenue. With the Quiet Zone rules in suspension, visitors are treated to frequent CSX freight trains and Amtrak passenger trains sounding off. Train day usually occurs on the last Saturday of April. During the event, Railroad Ave and England St are blocked off from vehicle traffic.

==In popular culture==
Scenes from the 1995 film &quot;Major Payne&quot; were shot at Ashland&#x27;s railroad station.

<text>Mechanicsville is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hanover County, Virginia, United States. The population was 39,482 during the 2020 census, up from 36,348 in the 2010 census.

==History==
The area was settled by English colonists starting in the 17th century. Rural Plains, also known as Shelton House, is a structure built in 1670 and lived in by male Sheltons until 2006. Located in the northern part of the Mechanicsville CDP, it is now owned and operated by the National Park Service as one of the sites of the Richmond National Battlefield Park.

In addition to Rural Plains, Clover Lea, Cold Harbor National Cemetery, Cool Well, Hanover Meeting House, Hanover Town, Immanuel Episcopal Church, Laurel Meadow, Locust Hill, Oak Forest, Oakley Hill, Selwyn, and Spring Green are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In downtown Mechanicsville stands a stone windmill, now a landmark in the area. The building was constructed as a Heritage Bank branch office in the 1970s. In 2007–2008, it was restored and enlarged by a new bank occupancy. The &quot;windmill&quot; is decorative and driven by an electric motor.

===American Civil War===
Mechanicsville, and the surrounding area, was the site of numerous battles during the American Civil War. The first was the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, which began on June 26, 1862. Confederate General A.P. Hill launched a series of assaults against Union Major General Fitz John Porter&#x27;s army positioned along Beaver Dam Creek, just east of Mechanicsville. Union forces repulsed the Confederate attacks and afterward withdrew to a new position along Boatswain Creek near Gaines&#x27; Mill. The Beaver Dam Creek engagement was the second in the series of Civil War battles known as the Seven Days Battles. A small portion of the battlefield in the southeast part of the CDP has been preserved as part of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, a park area administered by the National Park Service.

The Battle of Gaines&#x27; Mill was the third of the Seven Days Battles, occurring farther east of Mechanicsville. A portion of the battlefield has been preserved at the &quot;Watt House&quot; as part of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, a park area administered by the National Park Service.

Near Gaines&#x27; Mill was the Battle of Cold Harbor, the final major battle of Union Lieut. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s 1864 Overland Campaign. This was fought over the same ground as the Battle of Gaines&#x27; Mill. The area identified as part of the battlefield for &quot;Second Cold Harbor&quot; stretches from near the intersection of Walnut Grove Road and Mechanicsville Turnpike to &quot;Turkey Hill&quot; near the Rt. 156 crossing of the Chickahominy River. An area of the battlefield which saw heavy casualties and a nearby post-war National cemetery are preserved as historic monuments.

==Geography==
Mechanicsville comprises the western portion of Hanover County&#x27;s southern extension, north of the Chickahominy River. The southern border of the CDP, which follows the Chickahominy, is the Henrico County line, and at its closest point, Mechanicsville is less than two miles from the city limits of Richmond. U.S. Route 360 passes through the CDP, leading southwest to the center of Richmond and northeast to Tappahannock. Interstate 295, an eastern bypass of Richmond, crosses Mechanicsville from northwest to southeast, with access from exits 41, 38, 37, and 34. U.S. Route 301 forms the northwest border of the CDP, leading south to the center of Richmond and north to Bowling Green.

The original rural hamlet of Mechanicsville is in the southwest part of the CDP along US 360, just southwest of I-295 Exit 37. The CDP also includes the neighborhoods or named places of Pearsons Corner, Oak Forest, Kings Charter, Rural Point, Borkeys Store, Burnside Farms, Mayfield Farms, Carneals Store, Pole Green, Newman, Dogwood Knoll, Spring Meadows, Brandy Creek Estates, Windy Hill Estates, Ellerson Mill, and Simpkins Corner.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Mechanicsville CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.42%, are water. The southern part of the CDP is drained by the Chickahominy River and its tributaries, flowing to the James River, while the northern part is drained by tributaries of the Pamunkey River, part of the York River watershed.

<text>Highland Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Henrico County, Virginia, United States, east of Richmond. The population was 16,604 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Edmund Sewell Read founded the community of Highland Springs in the 1890s as a streetcar suburb of Richmond on the Seven Pines Railway Company&#x27;s electric street railway line between the city and the Seven Pines National Cemetery. There, many Union dead were interred, primarily as a result of battles nearby during the Civil War (1861–1865), most notably during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. The potential traffic of visiting families to the Richmond area from out-of-town needing transportation to and from the cemetery was a motivating factor for inception of the new street railway.

Read came to the area from Boston in hopes of finding a suitable climate for his ailing wife. The natural springs in the area made it a suitable choice for the Read family, and apparently an inspiration for the new name.

Approximately mid-way along the new streetcar route from Richmond through eastern Henrico County, Read bought a tract of land and divided it into lots. He laid out along the main street which was the pre-existing Nine Mile Road, new cross streets named in alphabetical order after plants, beginning from the west: Ash, Beech, Cedar, Daisy, Elm, Fern, Grove, Holly, Ivy, Juniper, Kalmia, Linden, Maple, Oak, Pine, Quince, Rose, and Spruce. One block south of and parallel to the Nine Mile Road, Read Street was named for its founder, Edmund Sewell Read.

The Sewells&#x27; large brick home is situated on the south side of Nine Mile Road between Grove and Holly, with Read Street to its rear. Today it serves as a medical office complex.

<text>Laurel is a census-designated place (CDP) in western Henrico County, Virginia, United States, named after the number of laurel trees in the area. The population was 17,769 at the 2020 United States Census. 

Laurel is the location of the Laurel Skate Park. The bowl was recently filled in with smooth concrete and the vertical ramp removed to make way for safer amenities.

==History==
Laurel&#x27;s previous names include Hungary; Hungary Station; Jenningsville, so named because the Jennings family, who were large landholders and have a family gravesite at the site of the historic district; and School. In the 19th century, Laurel was a stop on the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac (RF&amp;P) Railroad. It was a spur line that connected the coalfields in western Henrico with the rail network. During the Civil War, the station was burned. Union Army Colonel Ulric Dahlgren&#x27;s body was secretly buried there in March 1864; the body was later re-interred to Philadelphia. The RF&amp;P railroad is succeeded by CSX Transportation, which still operates on the same rights-of-way.

The A.A. Harvey General Store was built to serve the community. Over the years, the building has undergone several transformations. It went from general store to housing. It then became the Crystal Ice Co. and the Laurel Post Office, where Lillian Merkle was Postmaster. The Post Office was one of only a few in the United States that was privately owned. The building was completely restored in 1991 to its present use as the Laurel Gallery. Robert Bluford, the preservationist, made efforts to ensure that the restored building stayed true to its original style.

<text>Short Pump is a census-designated place (CDP) in Henrico County, Virginia, United States. It is a suburb of Richmond, Virginia. The population was 30,626 at the 2020 census.

The original village of Short Pump was located at the intersection of Three Chopt Road (formerly known as Three Notched Trail), Richmond Turnpike and Pouncey Tract Road. The area first centered around a local tavern that was expanded by Col. Robert H. Saunders beginning in 1814. According to local legend, it was named for the short handled water pump for stagecoach horses to drink from, which was located beneath the porch of the tavern, though there is some debate over the name&#x27;s origin. This area was on the principal route between Richmond and Charlottesville, as well as other towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Thomas Jefferson, the Earl Cornwallis, the Marquis de Lafayette, General Peter Muhlenberg, Stonewall Jackson and Ulric Dahlgren all visited this area.

The crossroads was officially named Short Pump by 1853, according to a Henrico County map found in the Virginia Historical Society.

It has now become part of Richmond&#x27;s Far West End. In 2003, developers opened Short Pump Town Center, a open air shopping mall. Other shopping and living spaces include West Broad Village.

Short Pump is noted for its shopping centers, restaurants, skating rink, and bowling alley. The area is an edge city of Richmond.

== History ==
Short Pump began as a local tavern stop situated at a strategic crossroads in the early nineteenth century. Purchased around 1814 by Col. Saunders, the tavern profited from the local coal industry, westward movement in the state, and the extension of roads in the period after the Revolutionary War. Along with the food, drink, and lodgings that taverns typically provided for visitors, this tavern served as a post-office, voting precinct, and local market during its roughly 35 years in business. It also briefly housed a school for young white men and a resident doctor. While a gathering spot for white locals and travelers, the tavern relied on enslaved labor and hosted occasional slave auctions.

The tavern eventually declined in the latter half of the nineteenth century, but the name stuck to the area. By the early twentieth century, the tavern was all but gone, and other buildings and businesses rose up to take its place. As automobiles replaced horses as the primary means of transportation, filling stations and garages popped up in the area. At the same time, those living in Short Pump increasingly saw themselves as a suburb of Richmond and worked to better their community through the building of new structures—like the Short Pump High School.

By the 1990s and 2000s, Short Pump transformed from a rural crossroads to an edge-city, a concentration of development on the outskirts of traditional urban areas. The Short Pump Town Center, a mega-mall, proved key to this transformation.

<text>Bassett is a census-designated place (CDP) in Henry County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,100 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Martinsville Micropolitan Statistical Area. The town was founded along a rail line by the same family that later started Bassett Furniture. Bassett Furniture&#x27;s headquarters have remained in Bassett since it began in 1902.

==History==
The John D. Bassett High School, Eltham Manor, and R.L. Stone House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town of Bassett was originally part of Horsepasture, Virginia. After John D. Bassett started a general store on his families land, the population started to grow around it and eventually his store incorporated a postal service. When the federal post office regulators asked John D. Bassett what they should call the area, he said &quot;Well, how about Bassetts&quot;? The &quot;S&quot; at the end was later dropped.

The train depot in Bassett was originally a combination station and had three trains a day picking up products from the company and providing railcar service to passengers. Its last passenger pickup was on February 18, 1961. Today it is used as a seasonal community market.

The Bassett Historical Center is located in the town. &quot;The Bassett Historical Center is the repository for all genealogical research and local history for the counties of Henry and Patrick County, Virginia and the City of Martinsville, Virginia.&quot; Now operated as part of the Blue Ridge Regional Library. &quot;Henry County is one of the seven counties in Virginia that has a Cohabitation List. Slaves were not permitted to marry legally but did have families, with the counties keeping records of which slaves were cohabitating. Also available is the &quot;Afro-American Marriages of Henry County, Virginia&quot;, by Harris and Millner, which would be helpful to find an ancestor dating back to the early or mid-1800s.&quot;

<text>Chatmoss is a census-designated place (CDP) in Henry County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,698 at the 2010 census, down slightly from the 1,742 reported in 2000. It is part of the Martinsville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Chatmoss takes its name from a 2,700-acre (11 km2) Hairston family plantation on the site, which was later incorporated into a larger country club building on the site. That name probably derives from &quot;Chat Moss&quot;, a large area of peat bog near Manchester, UK. In turn, that bog may be named after St Chad, or even from the Celtic word &quot;ced&quot;, meaning wood. Alternatively it may be an Old English personal name and &quot;mos&quot;, meaning &quot;swamp.&quot; Low-lying areas around Chatmoss were boggy wetlands prone to flooding from Leatherwood Creek before mitigation by several dams.

The Hairston family owned many plantations scattered across the South, including plantations in North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi and Virginia. The family&#x27;s Henry County plantations included still extant Beaver Creek Plantation and Hordsville, as well as plantations at Marrowbone, Magna Vista, Leatherwood, Camp Branch and Shawnee, which are no longer standing. The Chatmoss property was long owned by Harden Hairston, who inherited it, but it was later sold by a descendant to the developers of the country club on the site.

<text>Smithfield is a town in Isle of Wight County, in the South Hampton Roads subregion of the Hampton Roads region of Virginia in the United States. The population was 8,533 at the 2020 census.

The town is most famous for the curing and production of the Smithfield ham. The Virginia General Assembly passed a statute defining &quot;Smithfield ham&quot; by law in 1926, with one of the requirements that it be processed within the town limits. Smithfield Foods, a Chinese Fortune 500 company that owns Smithfield Packing Company and others, is the world&#x27;s largest pork processor and hog producer. The company, based in Smithfield, raises 12 million hogs and processes 20 million pounds of them annually.

==History and industry==
The area to later be called Smithfield was first colonized in 1634, is located on the Pagan River, south of Jamestown and on the south side of the James River. The Native Americans knew this area as &quot;Warascoyak,&quot; also spelled &quot;Warrosquoyacke&quot;, meaning &quot;point of land.&quot;

The Virginia colony officially formed Warrosquyoake Shire (with numerous variant spellings, including Warrascoyack, Warrascocke and &quot;Warwick Squeak&quot;) in 1634, but it had already been known as &quot;Warascoyack County&quot; before this. It was renamed as Isle of Wight County in 1637.

In 1730, the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730 established &quot;Warricksqueak Bay, in Isle of Wight County&quot; as the site of an official tobacco inspection house.

The town was established as a seaport in 1752 by Arthur Smith IV. The original survey and plat of the Town of Smithfield was made by Jordan Thomas, County Surveyor, for &quot;Captain Arthur Smith&quot; in 1750.

As a river town, its life and growth were dependent on the river. &quot;Wharf Hill&quot; was the waterfront location of the beginning of the industries of Smithfield. They eventually included peanuts and the raising of pork as commodities, leading to the town claiming the titles of &quot;Peanut Capital of the World&quot; and later &quot;Ham Capital of the World.&quot;

George Purdie, a County Justice and Postmaster of Smithfield during his lifetime, in 1763 purchased Lots 4 and 5 of the original plat of the Town of Smithfield. Purdie&#x27;s neighbor, Captain Mallory Todd, developed the business of curing and shipping the hams that has made Smithfield world-famous. The peanut industry continued until the fire of 1921, which destroyed the peanut warehouses. The peanut trade moved to the nearby railroad hub of Suffolk, Virginia.

Military actions of both the Revolutionary and Civil War took place in and around the town, as it was considered strategic due to its proximity to the James River. Revolutionary Patriots used Wharf Hill as a safe harbor for receiving arms and supplies, and a vantage point for directing Federal cannon fire on Main Street. Its dock has welcomed the fictional drama of the real &quot;Show Boat&quot; (James Adams Floating Theatre).

The Mansion on Main was the showplace home of a Victorian-era &quot;Virginian of Virginians&quot;, Richard Samuel &quot;R.S.&quot; Thomas (1837–1915). It was restored by Sala Clark in the late 1990s. His 1889 &quot;urban&quot; Queen Ann-style mansion changed the face of Smithfield (which had been dominated by colonial and cottage styles). Thomas helped to preserve the 1632 St. Luke&#x27;s Church, which in the late 20th century was recognized as a National Historic Landmark. Thomas literally &quot;wrote the book&quot; on St. Luke&#x27;s Church, &quot;The Old Brick Church Near Smithfield, Virginia,&quot; specifically to champion recognition of its 1632 date of construction and legacy. He presented his work to the Virginia Historical Society on December 22, 1891.

He wrote: &quot;It is my object to prove that this Church was built in 1632, and I shall prove it, 1. By the existence at that early date, of such strong, religious sentiment, as demanded a house of worship to the living God; 2. By tradition; 3. By lately existing records; and – 4. By the bricks and mortar of the Church itself.&quot;
Today, Smithfield has a population of 8,100. It is approximately in size. The ham production operation was purchased by a Chinese firm in 2014.

<doc id="137658" wikidata="Q1375162" url="?curid=137658" title="West Point, Virginia">
<text>West Point (formerly Delaware) is an incorporated town in King William County, Virginia, United States. The population was 3,414 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
West Point is located at (37.543733, −76.805366). The York River is formed at West Point by the confluence of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey rivers; from there, it separates the Virginia Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of eastern Virginia as it flows approximately to the Chesapeake Bay.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (23.12%) is water.

Much of the downtown is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Point Historic District.

== History ==
The current site of West Point was once the site of &quot;Cinquoteck&quot;, a Native American village of the local Mattaponi, an Algonquian-speaking tribe affiliated with the Powhatan Confederacy. During the first half of the 17th century, the Confederacy and the English colonists who established their first permanent settlement at Jamestown in 1607 were frequently in conflict. By mid-century, the Natives had been largely overcome, including the area of &quot;Cinquoteck&quot;, by the ever-expanding Colony of Virginia.

By treaty, the colonial government established reservations for the Mattaponi and Pamunkey in this area. More than 350 years later, Pamunkey and Mattaponi tribal members continue to occupy the reservations, located a few miles north of modern-day West Point. Both are state-recognized tribes, which now number 11.

In 1655, Port Richmond West Plantation, the home of John West, was developed to incorporate the former site of Cinquetock. West was a Governor of Virginia from 1635 to 1637.

After the West family sold off parts of the plantation, a settlement started at what became called West Point, which had access to the York River. In 1691, the Virginia General Assembly directed that West Point be chartered as a port of entry on the York. In 1705 the House of Burgesses authorized the town to qualify as a &quot;free borough&quot;, and renamed it &quot;Delaware&quot; in honor of former Royal Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. He was John West&#x27;s elder brother, an early settler of Jamestown, and an earlier colonial governor.

When the Richmond and York River Railroad was built and completed in 1861 to the port community, just before the onset of the American Civil War, the city took back its former name of &quot;West Point&quot;. The railroad was a key strategic goal of Union General George B. McClellan&#x27;s failed Peninsula Campaign in 1862 to capture Richmond. Massively damaged during the War, the railroad was later rebuilt. It became part of the Richmond and Danville Railroad system.

In 1870, West Point became an incorporated town. Linked to Richmond by rail, it became a major shipping point for passenger and freight traffic. It was especially convenient for travel to Baltimore and points north via the York River and the Chesapeake Bay. Much of the Richmond and Danville Railroad (including the section between Richmond and West Point) became part of the Southern Railway in the 1890s during a financial reorganization.

Until the early 20th century, West Point was a thriving commercial port and resort destination. However, the port status declined with the completion of more railroads to the ocean harbor area of Hampton Roads, notably including the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway at Newport News and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at Portsmouth. Likewise, tourists began to frequent newer destinations closer to the ocean.

After the decline of both shipping and tourism, a shipyard built in 1917 and a 1914 pulp paper mill are credited with bringing new jobs to the town. In the 1980s, the railroad was acquired by the Norfolk Southern Railway system in continued restructuring of the industry. It has continued to serve the town&#x27;s paper mill into the early 21st century.

==Public schools==
West Point is one of two towns in Virginia to have a school division (terminology for a school district in Virginia) which is independent from the school division of the county in which it is located. (The other town with an independent school division is Colonial Beach, located in Westmoreland County in the Northern Neck region.)

The West Point school systems are consistently recognized among the top rated public schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia. West Point also sends students to Maggie L. Walker Governor&#x27;s School for Government and International Studies.

<text>Irvington is a town on the Rappahannock River in Lancaster County, Virginia, United States. The population was 474 at the 2020 census. Located on a peninsula known as the Northern Neck, it has been designated a historic district.

==History==
From 1871 until 1893, the town was called &quot;Carter&#x27;s Creek Wharf&quot; or simply &quot;Carter&#x27;s Creek&quot;, since steamboats docked at the relatively deep water confluence of a tributary that had much earlier been called &quot;Cossotomen Creek&quot; and later &quot;Carter&#x27;s Creek&quot; after early settler John Carter, Sr., the father of the powerful colonial era politician King Carter, who was the Virginia agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary. The town formally adopted the name &quot;Irvington&quot; to honor Baltimore native Captain Levin Irvington following a 1891 referendum, since mail had been often confused between this town and that of Center Cross in relatively nearby Essex County.

The original Chesapeake Academy, 1889–1907, was located in Irvington.

==Historic district==

The historic district, Irvington, also known as Carters Creek, is a area that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. In 2000, it included 149 contributing buildings, 3 contributing sites and one other contributing structure.

Of the total residents, 454 were white, 10 were mixed race, 10 were Hispanic or Latino, 6 were black, 2 were Native American, 1 was Asian, and 1 was some other race. 89.2% of residents owned a house instead of renting.

The median age in Irvington was 58.6 years. 35.5% of the population was 65 of older. 10.4% of the population was a veteran, with 91.7% of those being male. 56.7% of the residents had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or other form of higher education.

== Features and amenities ==

Irvington is the home of the marine resort The Tides Inn. On King Carter Drive is the Steamboat Museum, which details the history of the steamboats that traveled the Chesapeake Bay and stopped in Irvington.

Lancaster National Bank (later Chesapeake National Bank and currently Chesapeake Bank) was formed in Irvington in 1900 to cater to the growing town. Irvington was also a stop for Chesapeake National Bank&#x27;s Boat &#x27;n Bank, a houseboat with bank tellers that cruised the Rappahannock River wharves, canneries and oyster houses. The town has a club, Rappahannock River Yacht Club, and a marina, Irvington Marina.

Children of the town attend Lancaster County Public Schools and there is one independent school located in Irvington. Reopened in 1965, Chesapeake Academy serves children from 3 years old through eighth grade. Chesapeake Academy&#x27;s original 1890 schoolhouse is located on King Carter Drive; it is now the Hope &amp; Glory Inn. Next door to the schoolhouse is the Irvington Methodist Church; its parsonage is now a women&#x27;s clothing store, The Dandelion.

Since the 1970s winemaking has become a growing vocation in the region, with a number of wineries located nearby. Irvington is located within the Northern Neck George Washington Birthplace American Viticultural Area winemaking appellation.

<text>White Stone is a town in Lancaster County, Virginia, United States. The population was 380 at the 2020 census. White Stone is one of many small towns located in Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck region.

==History==
White Stone traces its earliest colonial history to the arrival of Epaphroditus Lawson, who was born in Yorkshire, a county in northern England. In 1649–50, Epaphroditus acquired 4,600 acres of land along the Rappahannock River, including the present site of White Stone, where he lived until his death in 1652. For many generations thereafter, the Lawson family &quot;served the community as justices, sheriffs, and vestrymen.&quot;

The town of White Stone was founded in 1715, and sits adjacent to the nearby towns of Lancaster and Kilmarnock. However, White Stone was not incorporated until 1953. There are a variety of theories about how White Stone got its distinctive name: one story has the name derived from a nearby stream, where locals would use a white stone to hone their tools. Another story has the town&#x27;s name deriving from an 1819 church deed, which identified a property boundary as being &quot;near the road leading by the white stone.&quot;

The area was involved in the War of 1812 and the Civil War. During the latter conflict, the historic plantation home of Pop Castle was bombarded by a Union gunboat. Pop Castle would later be listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

Following the Civil War, White Stone had developed a small, thriving business community, including a general store, choral hall, and a hat-maker. By 1921, Albert Terry Wright served as principal for the county&#x27;s first school for black American students.

Ultimately, the city of White Stone&#x27;s &quot;heyday&quot; was during the late 19th and early 20th century, with the population having stagnated since the American Census of 1960, the first taken after the town&#x27;s incorporation. Today, White Stone remains a small, rural town, with a focus on tourism: the area is home to a local seafood market, the Allure Art Center, and other attractions. Additionally, the town has recently received state and federal grants to develop a sewer system and to revitalize its business district.

<text>Jonesville is a town in and the county seat of Lee County, Virginia, United States. The population was 872 as of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Jonesville was a small but thriving center of local commerce in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but like most towns in the central Appalachian region, it fell into gradual economic decline as the coal boom ebbed in the latter half of the twentieth century. By the end of the century much of the commercial real estate in its downtown area was either unoccupied or underutilized. Most of Jonesville&#x27;s remaining commercial activity is concentrated in the west end. Jonesville Drug, one of the oldest surviving downtown businesses, relocated to the old Chappell&#x27;s Dairy site on the west end in 2004.

Jonesville is the birthplace of Andrew Taylor Still, MD, DO (August 6, 1828 – December 12, 1917). Dr Still was a founder of Baker University in Kansas and the founder of the American School of Osteopathic Medicine (now A. T. Still University) in Kirksville, MO (1892). Dr Still is considered the founder of osteopathic medicine and is the author of four books published in his lifetime. In December 2013 Dr. Still was announced as an inductee to the Hall of Famous Missourians.

The Dickinson-Milbourn House and Jonesville Methodist Campground are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hamilton is a town in the Loudoun Valley of Loudoun County, Virginia, United States. The population was 506 as of the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Hamilton is located 6 miles west of the county seat Leesburg at (39.133889, −77.664151), near the western base of Catoctin Mountain.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.2 square miles (0.6 km2), all of it land.

==History==
The present Town of Hamilton was once occupied by several native tribes. European settlers arrived in the 1730s. In 1768, George and Tabitha Roach Tavenner built the first house in the Hamilton area. Their son, Richard and his wife Ann Hatcher, built an estate called &quot;Harmony&quot; and the surrounding area was thereafter known as Harmony.

The Leesburg and Snickers Gap Turnpike Company opened a road connecting Leesburg and Snickersville in 1831. Growth ensued and by 1833, the area had enough population to sustain Harmony Methodist Church, which was built on land donated by Richard and Ann Hatcher Tavenner. The town also became known as &quot;Hamilton Store&quot; after a store founded there by Charles Bennett Hamilton. In 1835, John Quincy Adams approved a post office located in Hamilton&#x27;s store and the town&#x27;s name was recorded as Hamilton.

The last important Civil War action in Loudoun County, known as The Harmony Skirmish, took place on March 21, 1865, as confederate Colonel John S. Mosby and his troops surprised troops commanded by Colonel Marcus Reno.

By 1868, a steam railroad from Alexandria had come to Hamilton along the future route of the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. Many tourists came to the town seeking relief from the city&#x27;s heat. There was a -mile boardwalk that traversed the town and a dance hall. By 1900, the Town of Hamilton was Loudoun County&#x27;s second largest town. The booming businesses in Hamilton included two newspapers, a butcher shop, a men&#x27;s clothing store, a broom factory, a milliner, a dentist, two hardware stores, a stove shop, a flat racecourse, a livery stable and boarding houses.

The advent of the automobile led to a slow decline in tourism. In 1926, many of the town&#x27;s central businesses were destroyed by fire and tourism thereafter declined sharply. Hamilton has since been known more as a residential community.

During the town&#x27;s history, it was the site of a vibrant Afro-American community.

The Hamilton Masonic Lodge, Janney House, William Smith House, Spring Hill Farm, and Sunnyside Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Transportation==
The only primary highway directly serving Hamilton is Virginia State Route 7 Business. SR 7 Bus follows Colonial Highway west to east through central Hamilton, connecting to Purcellville to the west and Leesburg to the east. Virginia State Route 7, which originally followed Colonial Highway through Hamilton, now bypasses the town just to the north. Via SR 7, travelers may head westward to Winchester or turn eastward, eventually reaching Alexandria. SR 7 also interchanges with Interstate 66, Interstate 81, Interstate 395 and Interstate 495.

==History, culture and notes==

Hillsboro originally spelled &quot;Hillsborough,” lies in the Hillsboro Gap of Short Hill Mountain, which is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains in northwestern Virginia. The town is about northwest of downtown Washington, D.C. and south of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

Early settlement in this area was stimulated by the growth of population in Pennsylvania of Germans and Quakers seeking religious freedom. Looking south for new, fertile lands to farm, many Quaker families migrated to the Loudoun area and had a significant impact on its development. The first record of settlement in the Hillsboro area, then referred to as the Gap, is dated 1746. Records of twice monthly meetings of the Gap Quakers, held in one of the houses, date to 1755.Although there were mills and houses in the Gap in the late 1700s, the town of Hillsboro (spelled Hillsborough until its 1880 incorporation) was not formally established until December 31, 1802 by an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly. The trustees of Hillsboro named in the act were Mahlon Hough, Samuel Purcell, Jr., Thomas Leslie, Josiah White, Jr., Edward Cunard, Mahlon Roach, and Thomas D. Stevens. By June 20, 1811, when Henry Griffin bought lot No. 12 on the town plat at auction for $88.50 paid to the trustees, he was required to build ‘a House thereon Twelve feet Square or equal thereto with a Stone or Brick Chimney to the same and a Shingle Roof on it within Four years of the Day of the Sale of the said lott.’ Due to its favorable location on the Vestal&#x27;s Gap Road, the town grew quickly and in the early 1800s was one of the leading trade centers of western Loudoun, along with Snickerville (Bluemont) and Woodgrove, which has since disappeared. Much of Hillsboro&#x27;s activity was due to its mills, with as many as five operating at one time, all on Catoctin Creek or its nearby branches.
During this period there typically were three or four doctors in town, five or six general stores, a large tanyard and cooper shop, two shoemakers and three taverns. Two blacksmiths, two saddle and harness makers, two wagon makers and a livery stable tended to the needs found in the horsepowered era. Seamstresses and tailors made clothes from the yarn goods produced by the Gaver woolen mill.

However, the newly constructed railroads and turnpikes bypassed Hillsboro, drawing trade and commerce away from the town. The Civil War events, including the Burning Raid of 1864, devastated the area. During the post-Civil War period, Hillsboro began its transformation from a busy commercial center to a primarily residential community. Homes formerly housing taverns, shops and stores gradually became residences. With the turn of the 20th century, virtually all of the currently existing structures within the town had been built and little has been altered in the majority of the structures since then.

Until 2000 there were no street addresses for the buildings in town; the 60-odd buildings in Hillsboro were referred to by their owners&#x27; names or their purposes.

A central feature of the town is its Old Stone School. Originally named Locust Grove Academy, the oldest part of the building, the east wing, was built in 1874. The academy&#x27;s first principal was Mrs. J.B. White. The Old Stone School, as it is referred to now, is situated at the eastern entrance to the town on Route 9. The stone structure was completed in 1917 with the addition of more rooms on the west side. A junior high school was established there in 1918 and operated for 17 years, until 1935. The brick auditorium was added in 1929. Classes for grades one through seven were taught there until the spring of 1966, when Hillsboro Elementary opened. The school was the hub of the community in the early 1900s. Community plays were frequently held there with a local orchestra that played during intermission.

Located next to the Old Stone School is Hillsboro Charter Academy, which opened in 2016 inside the former Hillsboro Elementary.

The Hillsboro Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1979.

In 2015, Hillsboro was the third smallest town in Virginia in population.

On December 28, 2016, the town limits officially tripled to . The zoning change brought the Old Stone School inside the town limits for the first time.

In June 2021, Hillsboro completed ReThink9, a $30 million infrastructure project which included creating two roundabouts on State Route 9 east and west of the town, traffic-calming streetscaping, burial of all overhead utilities, a new safe drinking water system, wastewater management infrastructure as well as an underground stormwater management system.

==Notable people==

* Byron Farwell was mayor of the town for three terms from 1976 to 1982; other mayors included Sandy Muir and Alix Spaith.
* John B. Funk (1905–1993), Maryland state politician and secretary of state of Maryland.
* The family of Mary Virginia Gaver, a leader in library science, owned and operated Gaver Woolen Mill in Hillsboro in the 1800s.
* Susan Koerner Wright, the mother of the Wright brothers, was born near Hillsboro.

<text>Leesburg is a town in and the county seat of Loudoun County, Virginia, United States. It is part of both the Northern Virginia region of the state and the Washington metropolitan area, including Washington, D.C., the nation&#x27;s capital.

European settlement in the area began around 1740, when it was named for the Lee family, early colonial leaders of the town. Located in the far northeast of the state, in the War of 1812 it was a refuge for important federal documents evacuated from Washington, D.C., and in the Civil War, it changed hands several times.

Leesburg is west-northwest of Washington, D.C., along the base of Catoctin Mountain and close to the Potomac River. The town is the northwestern terminus of the Dulles Greenway, a private toll road that connects to the Dulles Toll Road at Dulles International Airport. Its population was 48,250 as of the 2020 Census and an estimated 48,908 in 2021. It is Virginia&#x27;s largest incorporated town within a county.

Like much of Loudoun County, Leesburg has undergone considerable growth and development over the last 30 years, transforming from a small, rural, Piedmont town to a suburban bedroom community for commuters to the national capital. Growth in the town and its immediate area to the east (Lansdowne/Ashburn) concentrates along the Dulles Greenway and State Route 7, which roughly parallels the Potomac River between Winchester to the west and Alexandria to the east.

Leesburg is home to professional soccer team Loudoun United FC of the USL Championship division who play their home matches at Segra Field.

The Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center is in Leesburg.

==Toponym==
Leesburg may have been named to honor the influential Thomas Lee or more generally for the Lee family. The name change was passed by an Act of Assembly in 1758. Francis Lightfoot Lee and Phillip Ludwell Lee, two of Thomas&#x27; sons, were early town trustees. The town is not named, as is sometimes thought, for Robert E. Lee (Thomas&#x27; great-grandnephew).

==History==


Prior to European settlement, the area around Leesburg was occupied by various Native American tribes.

===17th century===
In 1670, John Lederer (1670) testified that the entire Piedmont region had once been occupied by the &quot;Tacci, alias Dogi&quot;, but that the Siouan tribes, driven from the northwest, had occupied it for 400 years.

In 1699, the Algonquian Piscataway (Conoy) moved to an island in the Potomac in the environs of Leesburg, and were there when the first known Europeans visited what is now Loudoun County.

===18th century===
What later became Old Carolina Road and is present day U.S. Route 15 was a major route of travel between north and south for Native tribes. According to local historians, a pitched battle was fought near present Leesburg between the warring Catawba and Lenape tribes, neither of whom lived in the area.

A war party of Lenape had traveled from their home in New Jersey and neighboring regions, all the way to South Carolina to inflict a blow on their distant enemies, the Catawba. As they were returning northward, a party of Catawbas overtook them before they reached the Potomac River, but were defeated in a pitched battle south of Leesburg. The surviving Lenape buried their dead in a huge burial mound, and early settlers reported that they would return to this mound to honor their dead on the anniversary of this battle for many years thereafter. The date of this conflict is unknown, but it seems the Lenape and Catawba were at war in the 1720s and 1730s.

European settlement near Leesburg began in the late 1730s as Tidewater planters moved into the area from the south and east, establishing large farms and plantations. Many of the First Families of Virginia were among those to settle in the area, including the Carters, Lees and Masons. The genesis of Leesburg occurred sometime before 1755, when Nicholas Minor acquired land around the intersection of the Old Carolina Road and the Potomac Ridge Road on present-day Route 7 and established a tavern there.

Despite lack of growth around the tavern, upon Loudoun County&#x27;s formation in 1757, Minor dubbed the sparse collection of buildings about his tavern &quot;George Town&quot; in honor of the reigning monarch of Great Britain. The village&#x27;s prosperity changed the following year when the British Colonial Council ordered the establishment of the county courthouse at the crossroads.

Minor had a town laid out on the traditional Virginia plan of six criss-cross streets. On October 12 of that year (1758), the Virginia General Assembly founded the town of Leesburg upon the that Minor laid out. Leesburg was renamed to honor the influential Thomas Lee and not, as is popular belief, his son Francis Lightfoot Lee, who lived in Loudoun and brought up the bill to establish Leesburg. When the post office was established in Leesburg in 1803, the branch was named &quot;Leesburgh&quot;; the &quot;h&quot; persisted until 1894.

===19th century===
During the War of 1812, Leesburg served as a temporary haven for the United States government and its archives, including the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution and portraits of early American leaders, including Benjamin Franklin, when it was forced to flee Washington in the face of the British Army. When reconstruction began on the United States Capitol, Potomac marble from quarries just south of Leesburg was used.

Early in the American Civil War, Leesburg was the site of the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff, a small but significant Confederate victory. The battlefield, along the Potomac River northeast of the town center, is marked by one of America&#x27;s smallest national cemeteries. The town frequently changed hands over the course of the war as both armies traversed the area during the Maryland and Gettysburg campaigns.

The Battle of Mile Hill was fought just north of the town prior to its occupation by Robert E. Lee in September 1862. Leesburg also served as a base of operations for Col. John S. Mosby and his partisan Raiders. The local courthouse is among the few courthouses in Virginia that was not burned during the Civil War; the present one was built in 1894.

In 1889, a 14-year-old black American Orion Anderson was killed by a white mob at the town&#x27;s freight depot; his murder would be the second of three recorded lynchings in Loudoun County, Virginia, between 1880 and 1902.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, Leesburg was the home of World War II General George C. Marshall, architect of the famous Marshall Plan that helped re-build Europe after the war, and radio personality Arthur Godfrey, who donated land for the town&#x27;s first airport.

Leesburg continued to serve as the center of government and commerce for Loudoun County. The town&#x27;s historic district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and cited as one of the best preserved and most picturesque downtowns in Virginia.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, Downtown merchants have recently labeled themselves &quot;Loudoun&#x27;s Original Town Center,&quot; largely in response to the growing number of mixed-use shopping areas in proximity. Leesburg has served Loudoun&#x27;s county seat continuously since the county&#x27;s formation in 1757.

===Historic sites===
The Leesburg area contains twenty-one entries on the National Register of Historic Places, including:
* Dodona Manor, the restored, early 19th century home of George C. Marshall, a general and diplomat who received the Nobel Peace Prize and owned the home from 1941 until his death in 1959.
* Exeter Plantation, delisted after it burned down.
* Glenfiddich House, a former Civil War era hospital where Robert E. Lee planned the invasion of Maryland.
* Morven Park, the estate of Virginia Governor Westmoreland Davis.
* Oatlands Historic House &amp; Gardens, a National Historic Landmark and former home of George Carter and William Corcoran Eustis.
* White&#x27;s Ferry, before closing in December 2020 was the only remaining ferry across the Potomac River, with its Virginia terminus northeast of town. It was a cable-guided car and passenger ferry. A ferry had plied the river from this site since 1828. According to WTOP, a Loudoun County businessman purchased White&#x27;s Ferry in February 2021 with the express purpose of reviving the historic Potomac River crossing.

At least sixty-three historic markers are located in and near Leesburg.

The airport was built in 1963 to replace the original Leesburg airport, which Arthur Godfrey owned and referred to affectionately as &quot;The Old Cow Pasture&quot; on his radio show. Godfrey, who, by the early 1950s, had purchased the Beacon Hill Estate west of Leesburg, used a DC-3 to commute from his farm to studios in New York City every Sunday night during the 1950s and 1960s. His DC-3 was so powerful and noisy that Godfrey built a new airport, funding it through the sale of the old field. Originally named Godfrey Field, it is now known as Leesburg Executive Airport at Godfrey Field.

<text>Lovettsville is a town in Loudoun County, located near the very northern tip of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States. Settled primarily by German immigrants, the town was originally established in 1836.

The population was 1,613 at the 2010 census and an estimated 2,198 in 2019.

==History==
Following the 1722 Treaty of St. Albans which established the Blue Ridge Mountains as the buffer between Native Americans and white settlers, German immigrants began arriving in the northern Loudoun Valley to farm the rich topsoil. They established several villages, many constructed of log and wooden buildings, and began to expand their land holdings. Lovettsville was then called &quot;The German Settlement&quot;.

In 1820 David Lovett subdivided his property into quarter-acre &quot;city lots&quot;. As a result of the ensuing construction boom, the town was called &quot;Newtown&quot;. In 1828, the town was again renamed, to &quot;Lovettsville&quot;. In 1836 the Virginia General Assembly established Lovettsville as a town, but the town was not fully incorporated until 1876.

During the Civil War, Lovettsville was an important transportation stop for Union troops crossing the Potomac River. Lovettsville was among the few communities in Loudoun County to vote against secession.

In 1940, Lovettsville was the site of a crash of a DC-3 airliner. It was the worst in US history at that time, killing 25 people, including U.S. Senator Ernest Lundeen, and became known as the Lovettsville air disaster.

The Lovettsville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

In 2018, after the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in franchise history, the town&#x27;s council voted to temporarily rename Lovettsville &quot;Capitals-ville&quot; for the duration of the finals.

<text>Middleburg is a town in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 673 as of the 2010 census. It is the southernmost town along Loudoun County&#x27;s shared border with Fauquier County.

Middleburg is known as the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Horse and Hunt Capital&quot; for its foxhunting, steeplechases, and large estates. The Middleburg Historic District, comprising the 19th-century center of town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

The town was established in 1787 by Revolutionary War officer and statesman Leven Powell. He purchased the land for Middleburg at $2.50 per acre in 1763 from Joseph Chinn, a first cousin of George Washington. It had been called &quot;Chinn&#x27;s Crossroads&quot; and was then called Powell Town. When Leven Powell declined to have the town named after him, the town was called Middleburgh, and later, simply Middleburg. The village is located midway between the port of Alexandria and Winchester, Virginia, on the Ashby Gap trading route (now followed by U.S. Route 50).

In 1863, Middleburg witnessed two skirmishes during the Gettysburg Campaign of the Civil War.

From the early 1900s, Middleburg began welcoming visitors who participated in foxhunting and steeplechasing. The village soon earned a reputation as the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Horse and Hunt Capital&quot;, attracting prominent visitors from across the U.S. Middleburg is the home of the National Sporting Library research center for horse and field sports, which publishes &quot;Thoroughbred Heritage&quot; on the Internet. A new addition is being made to include an art gallery and museum.

In 1961, activists of the Civil Rights Movement pressed John F. Kennedy on local segregation issues during his residency outside town. That year, he and Jackie had rented Glen Ora.

The Middleburg Historic District, comprising the 19th-century center of town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The oldest building in town, the Red Fox Inn &amp; Tavern, was originally established in 1728 by Joseph Chinn as Chinn&#x27;s Ordinary and is billed as the oldest continually operated inn in the U.S. The oldest known house still in use as a residence, &quot;Middleburg House,&quot; was built in 1779. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are Benton, the Burrland Farm Historic District, Green Pastures, Huntland, Mill House, Gen. William Mitchell House, Much Haddam, Unison Historic District, and Welbourne.

<text>Purcellville is a town in Loudoun County, Virginia. The population was 8,929 according to the 2020 census. Purcellville is the major population center for Western Loudoun and the Loudoun Valley. Many of the older structures remaining in Purcellville reflect the Victorian architecture popular during the early twentieth century.

==History==
Although the first land grant in the area was issued by Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1740, it was not until 1764 that Purcellville&#x27;s first known settler, James Dillon from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, arrived. The early ox cart track which wound westward from Leesburg towards the Blue Ridge, known later as the &quot;Great Road,&quot; served as the town&#x27;s nucleus, although farms existed in the area, and Ketoctin Baptist Church had been founded nearby by 1752. The first recorded business, an ordinary (a combined store and inn), was established by Abraham Vickers in 1799. This was followed by a second ordinary, established by Stacey Taylor in 1804, and later by &quot;Purcel&#x27;s Store&quot; and Post Office, established by Valentine Vernon Purcell (from whom the town&#x27;s name is derived). A blacksmith&#x27;s shop, established around 1848, was also among Purcellville&#x27;s earliest businesses. On July 9, 1853, the village officially adopted the name Purcellville.

The Great Road became an authorized turnpike in 1785 and extended the turnpike system westward from Alexandria to Snickers Gap, and beyond to Berryville and Winchester. With the construction of this Turnpike in 1832, travel through Purcellville began to increase and the first stagecoach arrived in 1841. A railroad link on the Alexandria, Loudoun, and Hampshire line (forerunner to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad) connecting the town to Leesburg and points east was built prior to the Civil War, and travel to points further west were continued by stagecoach through Purcellville.

Although both Union and Confederate armies passed through Purcellville during the Civil War, the town witnessed limited fighting with the most notable action occurring at the skirmish of Heaton&#x27;s Crossroads. The town and surrounding area were contained within the area known as Mosby&#x27;s Confederacy, the main area of operations for Confederate partisan John S. Mosby, and the town was pillaged as part of The Burning Raid of 1864 in retribution for the area&#x27;s support of Mosby&#x27;s command.

When the railroad was extended to Purcellville in 1874, the town took Leesburg&#x27;s place as the beginning of the stage route until the railroad was extended to Round Hill in 1875. The Southern Railway constructed the still existing Purcellville Train Station in 1891. The railroad ceased operation in 1968. Its right-of-way serves as the Washington &amp; Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park, which has its western terminus at the station.

The first public school was built in 1883. On March 14, 1908, the town was incorporated by an act of Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly.

In the 20th century, a series of disastrous fires, the first in 1900 and then two more in 1914, virtually wiped out the business district, depriving the town of what remained of its earliest architectural heritage. The town&#x27;s prominent location in the center of the Loudoun Valley and presence of the railroad helped the town to become the major agricultural center of Western Loudoun and led to redevelopment and expansion of the business district in the early and mid-20th century. In the latter 20th century, widening of Virginia State Route 7 has led to increased suburban development in and around the town and Purcellville&#x27;s traditional dependence upon agriculture as its primary source of income has since diminished as more and more residents are employed outside of the community

In addition to the Purcellville Train Station, Locust Grove, the Purcellville Historic District, Rich Bottom Farm, and The Tabernacle-Fireman&#x27;s Field are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Round Hill is a town in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States. Its population was 693 at the 2020 census. The town is located at the crossroads of Virginia Routes 7 and 719 (Woodgrove Road), approximately northwest of Washington, D.C. The town&#x27;s name refers a hill two miles northeast of a hill used during the American Civil War as a signal post by both Confederate and Union troops.
House of Round Hill was built in 2004.
Patsy Cline went to Round Hill Elementary School.

==History==

Round Hill was incorporated on February 5, 1900. From 1874 to 1900, the settlement had been the terminus of a Washington and Ohio rail line that ultimately became the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. The railway allowed agricultural products to be brought into Washington, D.C., and allowed the residents of the District to escape to the surrounding countryside for holidays. Many of the town&#x27;s older residences were originally boarding houses, inns, and taverns where people would go upon arrival. The town was considered a convenient destination as it lies close to the Shenandoah River (7 miles/11.3 km distant), the Shenandoah National Park (30 miles/48 km), the Appalachian Trail (4 miles/6.4 km), Harpers Ferry (15 miles/24 km), the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park (12 miles/19 km), and the paved Washington &amp; Old Dominion Railroad Trail (3 miles/4.8 km).

The town has recently been ringed by fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., that have brought thousands of residents to just outside the town. The town&#x27;s water and sewer infrastructure is used to serve many of these new developments. The town has a Hometown Festival every year on Memorial Day, complete with a parade and other activities, which are held both in the town park as well as outside of it. 

In 2019, the town was officially designated an Appalachian Trail Community by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Beginning that same year, an Appalachian Trail Festival has been held every summer at the now closed B Chord Brewing (located outside the town near Snickers Gap, alongside Route 7) to celebrate this designation.

The Ketoctin Baptist Church, Round Hill Historic District, and Woodgrove are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Louisa (originally named Louisa Court House) is a town in Louisa County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,983 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Louisa County.

==History==
Louisa Court House was named for the county courthouse constructed in 1742, near the intersection of Courthouse Road (now SR 208) and Main Street/Louisa Road (now SR-22/US-33). The village of Louisa Court House had been the county seat for over a century when it became a strategic location during the American Civil War for Virginia&#x27;s supply and communication lines.
Chartered in 1836 as the Louisa Railroad by the Virginia General Assembly, the Virginia Central Railroad mainline passed through the village. On June 10, 1864, thousands of men and horses of Gen. Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry division camped around the courthouse prior to the Battle of Trevilian Station. The VCR merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1868 (reorganized as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1878). The C&amp;O operated the mainline through Louisa over one hundred years, until the Chessie System merged into CSX in the 1980s.

The incorporated Town of Louisa was created by Act of the General Assembly in 1873. Many businesses found advantage in locating near the mainline, especially heavy industries that could transport using the railroad. As the road infrastructure improved and especially since the 1956 development of the interstate highway system&#x27;s I-64, local businesses transport mainly via semi-truck using US 33.

East of the Town of Louisa on Jeff Davis Highway is the Cooke Industrial Rail Park, a 1400 acre contiguous tract of land with over 1 mile of rail frontage, served by CSX and Buckingham Branch Railroad.

The town has a very deep history of mining, which gave her the name &quot;Mineral&quot; in 1902 (Originally the town&#x27;s name was Tolersville)

==History==

Mineral was originally known as Tolersville, 
but adopted its current name when it incorporated in 1902 due to the mining industry that supported the community. It was the center of gold mining activity in Louisa County; during its heyday, there were fifteen gold mines located within two miles (3 km) of the town. A zinc and lead mine also operated in the area into the 1970s.

Cuckoo, Harris-Poindexter House and Store, and the Mineral Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

At 1:51 p.m. on August 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was centered 5 miles (8 kilometers) south-southwest of Mineral, at a depth of 3.7 miles (6 kilometers). According to Associated Press, it &quot;forced evacuations of all the monuments on the National Mall in Washington and rattled nerves from Florida to Canada.&quot; The roof of Mineral&#x27;s town hall collapsed, and three of the six schools in the county&#x27;s school system suffered heavy damage. There were no fatalities, and only minor injuries.

<text>Victoria is an incorporated town in Lunenburg County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,725 at the 2010 census, which was down from the 1,821 reported in 2000.

== History ==
Lunenburg County in the Southside region was established on May 1, 1746, in Great Britain&#x27;s Virginia Colony from Brunswick County. The county is named for the former Duchy of Brunswick-Lunenburg in Germany, because one of the titles also carried by Britain&#x27;s Hanoverian kings was Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg.

After statehood, Virginia grew as part of the original 13 United States. Beginning in 1816, the Virginia Board of Public Works began providing engineering and financial assistance to internal improvements around the state in transportation which continued during most of the 19th century. However, Lunenburg County had been largely passed by as canals, turnpikes, and railroads were built across much of Virginia. At the beginning of the 20th century, the area which was to become Victoria was mostly farmland (primarily cultivating tobacco) and woodlands.

=== Born as a railroad town ===
Victoria was founded in 1906 as a planned community on what had been largely undeveloped land during the construction of the Tidewater Railway. This was a new east–west railroad chartered in 1904 with its right of way quietly secured in 1904 and 1905, so as to not alert the competition regarding plans to transport coal originated by its sister Deepwater Railway operating in southern West Virginia. The Tidewater Railway was chartered to cross Virginia from the West Virginia border near Glen Lyn, Virginia in Giles County by way of Roanoke and Suffolk to port at Sewell&#x27;s Point on Hampton Roads near Norfolk, Virginia. Both railroads were planned and built by the team of mining manager and civil engineer William Nelson Page and industrialist and financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, and added a third Hampton Roads coal exporting railhead to the existing Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (with coal piers at Newport News) and the Norfolk and Western Railway&#x27;s similar facilities at Norfolk&#x27;s Lambert&#x27;s Point.

Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom was a favorite of Henry Rogers, and the new town was named in her honor. Victoria was the midpoint of the VGN&#x27;s Norfolk Division, which extended from Sewell&#x27;s Point to Roanoke. Designated to be a &quot;division point&quot; on the railroad (specifically a location for crew changes and servicing of the steam locomotives), Victoria became the location of a large equipment maintenance operation with roundhouse, turntable, coaling and water facilities for servicing steam locomotives, and a large yard.

According to author H. Reid in his 1961 book &quot;The Virginian Railway&quot;, investors recalled the rapid growth of Roanoke between 1882 and 1884, which had been nicknamed the &quot;Magic City&quot; when the Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W) had established major facilities at the former bucolic location which had been earlier known as Big Lick. Comparisons were made when speculating about Victoria&#x27;s future potential. They could also look to nearby Crewe on the N&amp;W (about 20 miles away from Victoria) to see what a substantial volume of activity and employment a division point on a steam railroad could bring. Predictably, land sales at Victoria were brisk, and buildings (and jobs) soon followed.

In 1907, as they began nearing completion, the Tidewater and Deepwater Railways were combined to form the Virginian Railway (VGN). In March, the Tidewater Railway was formally rechartered by the Virginia State Corporation Commission as &quot;The Virginian Railway Company&quot; and William Nelson Page was elected president on April 15, 1907, at the first new board meeting in Norfolk. On April 22, the Deepwater Railway was acquired, formalizing the marriage of the two roads. Passenger service from Victoria to Norfolk began on June 17, 1907. The trip from Victoria took 12 hours, and operated once daily in each direction except Sundays, according to the first schedules published in the Norfolk &quot;Virginian-Pilot&quot; newspaper.

That first summer and fall, in conjunction with the Norfolk and Southern Railway (a regional predecessor of the 21st century Norfolk Southern System), service was offered to the Jamestown Exposition being held in Norfolk County that same summer. At the Exposition, VGN president Page served as Chief of International Jury of Awards, Mines and Metallurgy. United States President Theodore Roosevelt, attending the Jamestown Exposition, was one of the VGN&#x27;s earliest passengers, according to author Reid.

Adjacent to the Jamestown Exposition site on Hampton Roads at Sewell&#x27;s Point, a new coal pier was being built. Completion of the entire railroad took 2 additional years. The low gradient VGN was considered an engineering marvel of the time when it was completed in 1909. Soon, coal and other commodities began rolling through Victoria. The new Norfolk Division offices of the railroad were on located on a second floor which was added to the original Victoria passenger station a short time later.

The Virginia General Assembly granted a charter and incorporated the Town of Victoria on March 11, 1916.

Bechelbronn and Victoria High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== End of steam, mergers, abandonment ===
Victoria&#x27;s importance as a rail point declined sharply in the 1950s when the change to diesel-electric locomotives greatly reduced the labor and facilities needed. The last Virginian passenger train served Victoria in January 1956. VGN steam operations ended completely in June 1957. Then, on December 1, 1959, the Virginian Railway merged with the larger Norfolk and Western Railway. Under combined operations, the through coal traffic was shifted from Victoria to the bigger road&#x27;s main line through Crewe, Virginia, within commuting distance for N&amp;W&#x27;s Victoria-based employees. Local customers on the former VGN line through Victoria and nearby Kenbridge were few, and the portion of the line through Victoria and Kenbridge was eventually abandoned in the 1980s. All tracks and virtually all structures were removed, and a portion of the land donated to the community by N&amp;W.

Much like many other communities all across the United States, the end of steam railroading and the era of mergers and consolidation in the second half of the 20th century reduced rail-oriented employment opportunities and had a generally negative impact upon Victoria and the surrounding area. However, the community and Lunenburg County proved resilient, and by the late 1990s, transportation employment represented only a minimal portion of the area&#x27;s economy.

One of the biggest industries in Victoria is the prison industry. Located two miles from the center of town, the Lunenburg Correctional Center provides employment for many people living in and around Victoria.

== Remembering Victoria&#x27;s rail heritage ==

Early in the 21st century, work was begun to develop a rail heritage park and obtain a caboose to help present the town&#x27;s rail heritage. After several years of work, one of the last C-10 cabooses built in-house by VGN employees at the company&#x27;s massive shops complex in Princeton, West Virginia in the 1950s was located.

Rail preservationist, historian, and photographer Kenneth Miller of Roanoke had purchased Caboose 342 in the 1980s, and working with his father, had carefully restored it over a period of years. Miller, a long-time VGN fan, agreed to let Victoria have what is considered by many to be the finest extant VGN caboose for the new rail heritage park.

To prepare an appropriate display area for Caboose 342, a short stretch of roadbed was prepared, ballasted, and ties and rail were laid by volunteers in Victoria. The initials &quot;H.H.R.&quot; and &quot;W.N.P.&quot; were engraved as a lasting tribute to the founders of the Virginian Railway, industrialist and financier Henry Huttleston Rogers and coal mining manager and civil engineer William Nelson Page.

Late in 2004, Norfolk Southern carefully transported Caboose 342 from Roanoke to the NS rail yard at Crewe, Virginia by rail. From there, it traveled overland by truck and was placed on the new rails at Victoria on December 22, 2004. In Victoria, it has been placed on display fully equipped, and has become a popular attraction for school groups and retired railroaders alike.

==History==
Boydton was founded in 1812. It was home the original campus of Randolph-Macon College and Boydton Academic and Bible Institute which succeeded it after its move to Ashland, Virginia. The school was small and barely stayed in operation during the American Civil War as its focus abruptly changed from a Methodist seminary to military cadet training. In the difficult post-war Reconstruction years the trustees relocated the remote and struggling school to its present location in Ashland, Virginia, closer to railroad service.

Boydton/Clarksville was the terminus of the 19th-century &quot;Boydton and Petersburg Plank Road&quot; leading to Petersburg. This 80-mile (130-km) Plank road was covered with wooden planks, making it superior to other roads which were just unpaved dirt and rutted.

Boyd&#x27;s Tavern is an early 19th-century structure originally operated by merchant Alexander Boyd, a Scottish immigrant, which in recent years has been restored by his descendants and opened to public tours.

In 1952 the large Kerr Lake was created nearby, drawing many boaters, campers, and fishermen to the local area (see Clarksville, Virginia).

In addition to Boyd&#x27;s Tavern, the Boydton Historic District and the Mecklenburg County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

==History==

===European colonization, founding (1671–1771)===
In the mid-1600s, English colonists were still uncertain of what lay beyond the Allegheny Mountains, whose topography and possession by native inhabitants, Tutelo-speaking tribes, were a barrier to expanded settlement by the Colony of Virginia. Abraham Wood, who commanded Fort Henry on the frontier (now the site of Petersburg, Virginia), and operated an Indian trading post nearby, organized several expeditions to explore farther west. A passage over the ridge was finally found in 1671 when explorers Batts and Fallam, sent by Wood, reached the present-day location of Blacksburg, Virginia. Their expedition followed Stroubles Creek, through the current locations of the town and campus of Virginia Tech, to what they named Wood&#x27;s River.

They reported the area as inhabited by the Monacan and Moneton, Siouan-speaking groups, but the Virginian colonial legislature had authorized Wood to claim it. Accordingly, on September 17, 1671, the Batts and Fallam party claimed all of the lands comprising the river&#x27;s drainage basin for King Charles II. However, the region was not yet open to English patent. In 1700, Seneca warriors of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York and Pennsylvania, overran the entire area, driving out the other bands. As early as 1718, the Seneca had agreed to sell the parts they had conquered east of the Blue Ridge to the Colony of Virginia. Following another cession at the 1744 Treaty of Lancaster, however, there was a dispute between the tribe and colonists over whether the new boundary was the Alleghenies or the Ohio River. The site of Blacksburg lay just within this disputed zone.

By the 1740s, the Wood&#x27;s River Land Company, represented by Colonel James Patton, gained a large tract of land within present-day southwest Virginia. Part of the tract became Montgomery County and Pulaski County and was sold to Virginian, Irish, Scots-Irish, and English settlers as a reward for their services during the American Indian Wars and other wars. The Draper and Ingles families were among those who built their homes at Draper&#x27;s Meadow by 1748; this area was between the present location of the campus and the subdivision of Hethwood.

Because of its strategic location between powerful Indian nations, who alternately allied with the French or British as it suited them, plus its location through gaps into the Alleghenies further west, the area&#x27;s development was viewed with increasing apprehension by the French and their Indian allies. In July 1755, during the French and Indian War, hostile Shawnee Indians equipped and armed by France attacked the frontier outpost at Draper&#x27;s Meadow, which then had around twenty pioneer settlers. About four settlers were killed in the attacks, and five were taken captive to Kentucky by the Shawnee, among them Mary Draper Ingles, who later escaped. The memorial to Draper&#x27;s Meadow massacre was dedicated on a bridge located near Duck Pond. By the end of the war, Draper&#x27;s Meadow was deserted.

By the Treaty of Easton (1758), and again by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the British Crown made the Allegheny ridge separating the Mississippi and Chesapeake watersheds the official boundary between their Virginia colony and native peoples. It remained so until 1768, when native claims to the land including Blacksburg were cleared by the Treaty of Hard Labour with the Cherokee, and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Six Nations (Iroquois Confederacy). The Shawnee finally abandoned their claim to this territory in 1774 following Dunmore&#x27;s War.

===The Black family (1772–1797)===
Samuel Black, whose family settled in Staunton, Virginia, bought of land in the Draper&#x27;s Meadow area for his sons John and William in 1772. Smithfield Plantation, built in approximately 1774 by Colonel William Preston, was developed on the original Draper&#x27;s Meadow site, near the current location of the Duck Pond on the Virginia Tech campus.

When Samuel Black died in 1792, the land was evenly divided into two sections by his sons. The road now known as Draper Road is the dividing line between the sections. John Black&#x27;s property was later developed as the majority of the central campus of Virginia Tech.

In 1797, William Black laid out a small grid of streets and lots comprising 16 blocks on a portion of his land. The original town was limited to the area bounded by present-day Draper Road, Jackson Street, Wharton Street, and Clay Street. The town logo contains 16 small squares that create a larger square, representing the original 16 square blocks that were a part of Black&#x27;s design.

===Blacksburg&#x27;s establishment (1798–1870)===

After Black petitioned the state legislature to establish a town at the site, the official establishment and founding of Blacksburg was January 13, 1798, on the tract that he laid out. The following August 4, he signed over the deed to the town trustees. The town was named after him in his honor.

In 1808, a log cabin was built just east of Smithfield Plantation. Robert Preston, a future colonel of the 28th Virginia Infantry, lived here, as did two Virginia governors. The cabin was later added to in the mid 19th century to create a Greek Revival farmhouse now known as Solitude, which is the oldest building on the Virginia Tech campus. In 1872, the 250 acre Solitude farm became the central campus of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, and the house, after the death of its owner in the following decade, served as a college infirmary from 1882 to 1886. It was later used for faculty housing.

According to records of the Post Office Department of the National Archives and Records Administration, the post office was established as &quot;BLACKSBURGH&quot; on April 8, 1827. The name was changed to the current spelling (without the &quot;h&quot;) in 1893.

The Methodists had built two cabins to worship in since the town&#x27;s founding, but they did not build a more permanent structure until 1830, when they constructed a brick church. The Presbyterians were the next Christian denomination to build a church within Blacksburg&#x27;s limits. In 1848 they built their first brick building at 117 South Main Street. Though still standing, this building has not been used as a church for many years. It was once South Main Café, but is currently used as a restaurant called Cabo Fish Taco. It is also the oldest building on Main Street. The Baptists founded the third oldest church in the town in 1852.

In 1832, Westview Cemetery was established from a few acres of land that were deeded to trustees.

One of the first educational establishments started here was the Blacksburg Female Academy in 1840. The Olin and Preston Institute (re-charted as Preston and Olin Institute in 1869) was a Methodist-sponsored academy established in 1851.

The first bank in Montgomery County, Blacksburg Savings Institution, was established in 1849. The first newspaper published in Blacksburg was the &quot;Montgomery Messenger&quot;. Its first issue was printed in 1869.

===Incorporation, modernization (1871–1951)===

In 1871, the village that became known as Blacksburg was incorporated and Thomas W. Jones became the first mayor.

One year later, the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College opened on October 2, 1872, with a faculty of three members. The college grew and became known as Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI), later, &quot;and State University&quot; was added to the name, which shortly afterward became informally referred to as Virginia Tech. It is now officially called Virginia Tech. It is Virginia&#x27;s land-grant university.

A fire-fighting unit was organized within the university in 1899. The town bought its first fire truck 43 years later. The Blacksburg First Aid and Life Saving Crew was founded in 1951 and renamed Blacksburg Volunteer Rescue Squad in another addition to the growing amount of emergency services.

The first automobile came through the town in 1901. Three years later the train entered Blacksburg from Christiansburg using the Virginia Anthracite &amp; Coal Railroad, which later became known as the &quot;Huckleberry.&quot; Traffic in Blacksburg increased sufficiently enough that by January 1913 the town voted against allowing cows to continue to roam in town. The first filling station was opened in 1919 and at the time was the only one between Roanoke, Virginia, and Bluefield, West Virginia. The town&#x27;s first landing strip was built in 1929 and was 1,800 feet (548.64 m) in length. The grass landing strip was given airport status in 1931 and later became Virginia Tech Airport. Local buses began to make their rounds for the first time in 1947.

The town&#x27;s first theater was built in 1909. It was a precursor to the Lyric Theatre on College Avenue.

In the spring of 1935, Main Street was strung with ten street lights from Roanoke Street northward to the top of the hill, where it now intersects the Alumni Mall. By October the town&#x27;s second stoplight was installed on Main Street at Roanoke Street and was synchronized with the original one at Main and College. The establishment of official law enforcement began in 1937 when Officer Dave &quot;Highpockets&quot; Sumner became the first Blacksburg police officer. The first police car was purchased nine years later.

===Compulsory education and commercialization (1952–1992)===
Blacksburg experienced a boost of compulsory education during the second half of the 20th century. Even though there had been a place for secondary education somewhere in town since 1906, it was not until 1952 when the first facility for Blacksburg High School was built on South Main and Eheart Streets. Later it moved to new quarters and was adapted as Blacksburg Middle School. That same year, all high schools in Montgomery County began operating on a twelve-grade basis which is still county policy to this day.

The Margaret J. Beeks Elementary School and the Gilbert F. Linkous Elementary School were both completed in 1963 and Harding Avenue Elementary School was built in 1972. Two years later, in 1974, Blacksburg High School moved its location to Patrick Henry Drive after 20 years of issues with overcrowding in its previous location.

Jack Goodwin was appointed the first chief of police by the Blacksburg Town Council in 1954. Jan Olinger was made the first female police officer in 1976.

1958 marked the beginning of the end for the railroad that came to be known as the &quot;Huckleberry.&quot; In the 1960s, however, railroads underwent restructuring. Passenger service came to an end on July 25. On June 30, 1966, the last freight train arrived at the Blacksburg depot. Within 24 hours, the depot was closed, the empty cars were picked up, and the tracks were immediately removed. After years of effort by the citizens of the town a trail was constructed on the former railroad right-of-way and, after years of construction, funding and planning issues the Huckleberry Trail was opened to the public on December 1, 1998. 190 years after its original construction, the newly renovated Smithfield Plantation house was re-opened in 1964.

The amount of commercialization in the area began to increase in the mid-1960s. The Corning Glass Works (now called Corning Incorporated), based in upper New York State, opened a manufacturing facility in 1964 that is located south of Blacksburg. The Blacksburg Municipal Building on South Main Street was constructed in 1969. Terrace View apartments, the first large student complex, was built in 1970. The Blacksburg Branch of the Montgomery County Library was opened the same year. Ten years later, it was moved into the facility that used to house the Blacksburg Lumber Company on Draper Road. In 1971, Blacksburg ratified a new charter and LewisGale Hospital Montgomery was built. The University Mall shopping center opened that year as well. In the mid 1970s the Foxridge apartments, an even larger student apartment complex, was built as part of the Hethwood development. During 1981, the Blacksburg Community Center opened. It cost the town $1.2 million to build. By 1988, the New River Valley Mall, located in the neighboring town of Christiansburg, was opened and the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center had its first ground-breaking ceremony.

After construction of Virginia&#x27;s portion of Interstate 81 began in 1957, nine years passed before the Christiansburg-area segment was opened. About half that amount of time passed before the U.S. Route 460 bypass opened in 1969.

In the 1970s, Virginia Tech was annexed into the town and the town acquired other land. Together with the effect of the annexations, the population grew from 9,000 people to 30,000 during this decade. Replacing the old public bus system, Blacksburg Transit began running in 1983.

===Information age (1993–present)===

Blacksburg is the site of the Blacksburg Electronic Village or BEV, conceived as a computer networking project of Virginia Tech in 1991 and officially born in 1993 as a way to link the town together using the Internet. This project quickly ushered the town into what is being called the Information Age.

In 1994, Montgomery County Public Schools completed construction of Kipps Elementary School at 2801 Prices Fork Road. By this time, Blacksburg had five elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school. A newly renovated Blacksburg branch library was opened in 1996.

In the aftermath of railroad restructuring, many rail lines were abandoned. After 24 years of abandonment and six years of planning and construction, the first phase of the Huckleberry Trail built on the old Huckleberry railbed opened in 1996. The second phase of construction was completed in 1998. In 2019, the Blacksburg Rotary Mountain Bike Skills Park opened with funding from Blacksburg Parks and Recreation and donations.

On July 8, 1997, ground was broken for the experimental &quot;Smart Road&quot; project. The second phase of construction was completed in 2002. The road is currently closed to the public and used as a research test bed for the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. A National Weather Service office is located in Blacksburg and serves most of southwestern Virginia, southeast West Virginia, and northwest North Carolina.

In 2003, the new building for Blacksburg Middle School students opened on Prices Fork Road adjacent to the property housing Kipps Elementary School.

On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho shot 32 people dead and injured an additional 17 in the Virginia Tech shooting before committing suicide. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting on a college campus since the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966.

On January 21, 2009, Zhu Haiyang decapitated Yang Xin at Virginia Tech in the first campus murder since the Virginia Tech shooting.

On February 13, 2010, following a snowstorm that dropped two feet of snow on the area, the gymnasium roof on the previously occupied Blacksburg High School suffered a catastrophic structural failure and collapsed, causing structural damage to other areas of the school. The school building was condemned and students attended night school on a split schedule with the Blacksburg Middle School students at their school for the remainder of the year. It was determined that repair costs would exceed $18 million and would not be feasible given the age of the school; it was decided not to repair the building. Before the school year of 2013-14 Blacksburg High School was operating on a normal schedule out of the Blacksburg Middle School building on 3109 Prices Fork Road, and the middle schoolers were going to school in the old Christiansburg Middle School. The original Blacksburg High School building was vacant until it was demolished in the Summer of 2011. The newly constructed school building of Blacksburg High School which opened for the 2013 fall semester is located at 3401 Bruin Lane, behind the current Blacksburg Middle School and Bill Brown Football Stadium.
== Government ==
Blacksburg is governed by a Town Council of six members and a mayor. Elections take place in November of odd-numbered years. Council members are elected for four-year terms.

The town’s mayor is an elected office.

By tradition, the town&#x27;s vice-mayor is the councilperson who received the highest number of votes in the most recent election and is formally elected by council at the first meeting of the new year.


==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of of which is land and , or 0.10%, is water. At 2,080 feet (634 m) above sea level, Blacksburg is located in the New River Valley and also sits astride the Eastern Continental Divide. It is the 15th largest municipality and the largest town in the commonwealth of Virginia. The Eastern Continental Divide traverses the Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport.

The tallest building in Blacksburg is Slusher Tower, a twelve-story residence hall on the Virginia Tech campus. The building with the highest elevation is actually Hoge Hall (formerly Lee Hall), another residence hall, which until May 17, 2009, was home to the transmitter of campus radio station WUVT. The tower for WUVT now sits atop Price Mountain.

===Climate===
Due to its elevation, the climate of Blacksburg is a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), being cooled down from the lowland areas of Virginia, all of which possess a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Summers are humid with warm to hot temperatures, although the area sees significantly cooler temperatures than places of lower elevation at the same latitude, with only 5 days of + highs annually. Winters are generally cool to cold, with occasional intervening warm periods and an average of 0.9 nights of sub- lows. Monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July. Snowfall averages per season and generally occurs from December to March, although significant snowfall has been recorded outside of those months.
