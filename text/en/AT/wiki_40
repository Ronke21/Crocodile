<text>Nancy is the prefecture of the northeastern French department of Meurthe-et-Moselle. It was the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine, which was annexed by France under King Louis XV in 1766 and replaced by a province, with Nancy maintained as capital. Following its rise to prominence in the Age of Enlightenment, it was nicknamed the &quot;capital of Eastern France&quot; in the late 19th century. The metropolitan area of Nancy had a population of 508,793 inhabitants as of 2021, making it the 16th-largest functional urban area in France and Lorraine&#x27;s largest. The population of the city of Nancy proper is 104,387 (2022).

The motto of the city is —a reference to the thistle, which is a symbol of Lorraine. Place Stanislas, a large square built between 1752 and 1756 by architect Emmanuel Héré under the direction of Stanislaus I of Poland to link the medieval old town of Nancy and the new city built under Charles III, Duke of Lorraine in the 17th century, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the first square in France to be given this distinction. The city also has many buildings listed as historical monuments and is one of the European centres of Art Nouveau thanks to the École de Nancy. Nancy is also a large university city; with the Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brabois, the conurbation is home to one of the main health centres in Europe, renowned for its innovations in surgical robotics.

==History==
The earliest signs of human settlement in the area date to 800 BC. Early settlers were likely attracted by easily mined iron ore and a ford in the river Meurthe. Its name is first attested as &quot;Nanciaco&quot;, possibly from a Gaulish personal name. A small fortified town named Nanciacum (&quot;Nancy&quot;) was built by Gérard, Duke of Lorraine around 1050.

Nancy was burned in 1218 at the end of the War of Succession of Champagne, and conquered by Emperor Frederick II. It was rebuilt in stone over the next few centuries as it grew in importance as the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine. Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy, was defeated and killed in the Battle of Nancy in 1477; René II, Duke of Lorraine became the ruler. 
Following the failure of both Emperor Joseph I and Emperor Charles VI to produce a son and heir, the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 left the throne to the latter&#x27;s next child. This turned out to be a daughter, Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1736, Emperor Charles arranged her marriage to Duke François of Lorraine, who reluctantly agreed to exchange his ancestral lands for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

The exiled Polish king Stanislaus I (&quot;Stanisław Leszczyński&quot; in Polish), father-in-law of the French king Louis XV, was then given the vacant duchy of Lorraine. Under his nominal rule, Nancy experienced growth and a flowering of Baroque culture and architecture. Stanislaus oversaw the construction of Place Stanislaus, a major square and development connecting the old medieval with a newer part of the city. On the south side of the Place Stanislaus is the Hôtel de Ville, which was completed in 1755. Upon Stanislaus&#x27; death in February 1766, Lorraine and Barrois became a regular government of the Kingdom of France. A &quot;parlement&quot; for Lorraine and Barrois was established in Nancy in 1776.

As unrest surfaced within the French Armed Forces during the French Revolution, a full-scale mutiny, known as the Nancy affair, took place in Nancy in the latter part of summer 1790. A few units loyal to the government laid siege to the town and shot or imprisoned the mutineers.
In 1871, Nancy remained French when Germany annexed Alsace-Lorraine. In 1909 it hosted the Exposition Internationale de l&#x27;Est de la France between May and November.

Nancy was occupied by German forces beginning in 1940 and renamed Nanzig. During the Lorraine Campaign of World War II, Nancy was liberated from Nazi Germany by the US Third Army in September 1944, at the Battle of Nancy.

In 1988, Pope John Paul II visited Nancy. In 2005, French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski inaugurated the renovated Place Stanislas, which was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

==Geography==
Nancy is situated on the left bank of the river Meurthe, about 10 km upstream from its confluence with the Moselle. The Marne–Rhine Canal runs through the city, parallel to the Meurthe. Nancy is surrounded by hills that are about 150 m higher than the city center, which is situated at 200 m above mean sea level. The area of Nancy proper is relatively small: 15 km2. Its built-up area is continuous with those of its adjacent suburbs. The neighboring communes of Nancy are: Jarville-la-Malgrange, Laxou, Malzéville, Maxéville, Saint-Max, Tomblaine, Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy and Villers-lès-Nancy.

The oldest part of Nancy is the quarter &quot;Vieille Ville – Léopold&quot;, which contains the 14th century &quot;Porte de la Craffe&quot;, the Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine, the Porte Désilles and the 19th century St-Epvre basilica. Adjacent to its south is the quarter &quot;Charles III – Centre Ville&quot;, which is the 16th–18th century &quot;new town&quot;. This quarter contains the famous Place Stanislas, the Nancy Cathedral, the Opéra national de Lorraine and the main railway station.

The population of the city proper experienced a small decrease in population since 2007, placing it behind Metz as the second largest city in the Lorraine. However, the urban area of Metz experienced population decline from 1990 to 2010 while the urban area of Nancy grew over the same period, becoming the largest urban area in Lorraine and second largest in the &quot;Grand Est&quot; region of northeastern France. Within the Nancy metropolitan area in recent years, the city population declined slightly (2009–2014) at the roughly same time as a small increase in the population of its urban area (2006–2012).

===Climate===
Nancy has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), although a bit more extreme than most of the larger French cities. By the standards of France it is a &quot;continental&quot; climate with a certain degree of maritime (unrelated to the Köppen classification, since generally the whole country has a predominant mechanism favored by the West winds).

The temperatures have a distinct variation of the temperate zone, both during the day and between seasons but without being very different. Winters are cold and dry in freezing climates. Summers are not always sunny, but warm enough. Mists are frequent in autumn and the winds are light and not too violent. Precipitation tends to be less abundant than in the west of the country. Sunshine hours are almost identical to Paris and the snowy days are the same as Strasbourg (most similar weather conditions). Although the lowest recorded temperature is officially −26.8 °C, some sources consider temperatures from −30 °C on 10 December 1879 before continuous data.



==Demographics==
==Main sights==
The old city center&#x27;s heritage dates from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. The cathedral of Nancy, the Triumphal Arch and the &quot;Place de la Carrière&quot; are a fine examples of 18th-century architecture. The Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine is the former princely residence of the rulers. The palace houses the Musée Lorrain.

A historic church is the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Nancy, final resting place of the last duke Stanislas. Other notable churches are the Church of Saint-François-des-Cordeliers and the Basilica of Saint-Epvre, which have historical ties to the ducal House of Lorraine.The Place Stanislas named after king of Poland and duke of Lorraine Stanislaus I, Place de la Carrière, and Place d&#x27;Alliance were added on the World Heritage Sites list by the UNESCO in 1983.

The &quot;École de Nancy&quot;, a group of artists and architects founded by the glassmaster and furniture maker Émile Gallé, worked in the Art Nouveau style at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century. It was principally their work which made Nancy a center of art and architecture that rivaled Paris and helped give the city the nickname &quot;Capitale de l&#x27;Est&quot;. The city still possesses many Art Nouveau buildings (mostly banks or private homes). Furniture, glassware, and other pieces of the decorative arts are conserved at the Musée de l&#x27;École de Nancy, which is housed in the 1909 villa of Eugène Corbin, a Nancy businessman and supporter of the Art Nouveau there. The Musée des Beaux-Arts has further collections of the Art Nouveau movement.

A major botanical garden, the &quot;Jardin botanique du Montet&quot;, is located at Villers-lès-Nancy. Other gardens of interest include the city&#x27;s earliest botanical garden, the &quot;Jardin Dominique Alexandre Godron&quot;, and various other public gardens and places of interest including the Pépinière and Parc Sainte-Marie (public gardens). The town also has an aquarium. The surroundings of the train station are a busy commercial area.

==Transport==
The main railway station is Gare de Nancy-Ville, with direct connections to Paris (high-speed rail line), Metz, Lyon, Strasbourg and several regional destinations. The motorway A31 connects Nancy with Metz, Luxembourg and Langres.

A nearby regional airport Lorraine Airfield provides scheduled air service to several cities within France. 

Public transport within Nancy is provided by &quot;Service de Transport de l&#x27;Agglomération Nancéienne&quot; (STAN), operated since 2019 by Keolis and including around 20 conventional bus routes and one trolleybus route. The Nancy trolleybus system has been in operation since 1982, originally with six routes. From 2001 until early 2023, the one remaining route was known as the &quot;Tram&quot; by STAN, because it used Bombardier Transportation&#x27;s Guided Light Transit (GLT) technology, but conventional unguided trolleybuses are being readied to take over the service again in 2025.

==Heraldry==
The coat of arms of Nancy displays a thistle, originally considered to be a symbol of Virgin Mary, and adopted as a personal symbol by René of Anjou and later by his descendant René II, Duke of Lorraine. Contrary to the Scottish thistle, the one of Lorraine is always shown with its roots. During the wars against Burgundy, the thistle became an emblem for the people of Lorraine as a whole. It officially became the attribute of the city of Nancy in 1575 when Charles III, Duke of Lorraine granted the city with its own coat of arms.

At first, the coat of arms of Nancy had a chief of Lorraine, which meant that the upper part showed the ducal arms, namely three alerions on a red bend. Later, the chief of Lorraine was replaced by a more complex one which gathers the former possessions of the Dukes of Lorraine. The upper row comprises from left to right the arms of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Crown of Aragon, while the lower row comprises the Duchy of Anjou, the Duchy of Guelders, the Duchy of Jülich and the County of Bar. The inescutcheon is the coat of arms of Lorraine itself.

The coat of arms displays the motto, which appeared in the end of the 16th century. It was initially &quot;Nul ne s&#x27;y frotte&quot; (&quot;no one attacks it&quot;), but it was changed to Latin &quot;&quot;Non inultus premor&quot; in 1616. The motto has a similar meaning to the Scottish one, &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot;&quot;, usually translated as &quot;No one attacks me with impunity&quot;, which also makes reference to the thistle. The coat of arms further displays the Legion of Honour, awarded to the city after the First World War, and the War Crosses 14–18 and 39–45.

<text>A steroid is an organic compound with four fused rings (designated A, B, C, and D) arranged in a specific molecular configuration. 
Steroids have two principal biological functions: as important components of cell membranes that alter membrane fluidity; and as signaling molecules. Examples include the lipid cholesterol, sex hormones estradiol and testosterone, anabolic steroids, and the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid drug dexamethasone. Hundreds of steroids are found in fungi, plants, and animals. All steroids are manufactured in cells from the sterols lanosterol (opisthokonts) or cycloartenol (plants). Lanosterol and cycloartenol are derived from the cyclization of the triterpene squalene.

Steroids are named after the steroid cholesterol which was first described in gall stones from Ancient Greek &quot;chole-&quot; &#x27;bile&#x27; and &quot;stereos&quot; &#x27;solid&#x27;.

The steroid nucleus (core structure) is called gonane (cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene). It is typically composed of seventeen carbon atoms, bonded in four fused rings: three six-member cyclohexane rings (rings A, B and C in the first illustration) and one five-member cyclopentane ring (the D ring). Steroids vary by the functional groups attached to this four-ring core and by the oxidation state of the rings. Sterols are forms of steroids with a hydroxy group at position three and a skeleton derived from cholestane. Steroids can also be more radically modified, such as by changes to the ring structure, for example, cutting one of the rings. Cutting Ring B produces secosteroids one of which is vitamin D3.

== Nomenclature ==
=== Rings and functional groups ===

Gonane, also known as steran or cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene, the nucleus of all steroids and sterols, is composed of seventeen carbon atoms in carbon-carbon bonds forming four fused rings in a three-dimensional shape. The three cyclohexane rings (A, B, and C in the first illustration) form the skeleton of a perhydro derivative of phenanthrene. The D ring has a cyclopentane structure. When the two methyl groups and eight carbon side chains (at C-17, as shown for cholesterol) are present, the steroid is said to have a cholestane framework. The two common 5α and 5β stereoisomeric forms of steroids exist because of differences in the side of the largely planar ring system where the hydrogen (H) atom at carbon-5 is attached, which results in a change in steroid A-ring conformation. Isomerisation at the C-21 side chain produces a parallel series of compounds, referred to as isosteroids.

Examples of steroid structures are:

In addition to the ring scissions (cleavages), expansions and contractions (cleavage and reclosing to a larger or smaller rings)—all variations in the carbon-carbon bond framework—steroids can also vary:
* in the bond orders within the rings,
* in the number of methyl groups attached to the ring (and, when present, on the prominent side chain at C17),
* in the functional groups attached to the rings and side chain, and
* in the configuration of groups attached to the rings and chain.
For instance, sterols such as cholesterol and lanosterol have a hydroxyl group attached at position C-3, while testosterone and progesterone have a carbonyl (oxo substituent) at C-3. Among these compounds, only lanosterol has two methyl groups at C-4. Cholesterol which has a C-5 to C-6 double bond, differs from testosterone and progesterone which have a C-4 to C-5 double bond.

=== Naming convention ===
Almost all biologically relevant steroids can be presented as a derivative of a parent cholesterol-like hydrocarbon structure that serves as a skeleton. These parent structures have specific names, such as pregnane, androstane, etc. The derivatives carry various functional groups called suffixes or prefixes after the respective numbers, indicating their position in the steroid nucleus. There are widely used trivial steroid names of natural origin with significant biologic activity, such as progesterone, testosterone or cortisol. Some of these names are defined in The Nomenclature of Steroids. These trivial names can also be used as a base to derive new names, however, by adding prefixes only rather than suffixes, e.g., the steroid 17α-hydroxyprogesterone has a hydroxy group (-OH) at position 17 of the steroid nucleus comparing to progesterone.

The letters α and β denote absolute stereochemistry at chiral centers—a specific nomenclature distinct from the R/S convention of organic chemistry to denote absolute configuration of functional groups, known as Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules. The R/S convention assigns priorities to substituents on a chiral center based on their atomic number. The highest priority group is assigned to the atom with the highest atomic number, and the lowest priority group is assigned to the atom with the lowest atomic number. The molecule is then oriented so that the lowest priority group points away from the viewer, and the remaining three groups are arranged in order of decreasing priority around the chiral center. If this arrangement is clockwise, it is assigned an R configuration; if it is counterclockwise, it is assigned an S configuration. In contrast, steroid nomenclature uses α and β to denote stereochemistry at chiral centers. The α and β designations are based on the orientation of substituents relative to each other in a specific ring system. In general, α refers to a substituent that is oriented towards the plane of the ring system, while β refers to a substituent that is oriented away from the plane of the ring system. In steroids drawn from the standard perspective used in this paper, α-bonds are depicted on figures as dashed wedges and β-bonds as solid wedges.

The name &quot;11-deoxycortisol&quot; is an example of a derived name that uses cortisol as a parent structure without an oxygen atom (hence &quot;deoxy&quot;) attached to position 11 (as a part of a hydroxy group). The numbering of positions of carbon atoms in the steroid nucleus is set in a template found in the Nomenclature of Steroids that is used regardless of whether an atom is present in the steroid in question.

Unsaturated carbons (generally, ones that are part of a double bond) in the steroid nucleus are indicated by changing -ane to -ene. This change was traditionally done in the parent name, adding a prefix to denote the position, with or without Δ (Greek capital delta) which designates unsaturation, for example, 4-pregnene-11β,17α-diol-3,20-dione (also Δ4-pregnene-11β,17α-diol-3,20-dione) or 4-androstene-3,11,17-trione (also Δ4-androstene-3,11,17-trione). However, the Nomenclature of Steroids recommends the locant of a double bond to be always adjacent to the syllable designating the unsaturation, therefore, having it as a suffix rather than a prefix, and without the use of the Δ character, i.e. pregn-4-ene-11β,17α-diol-3,20-dione or androst-4-ene-3,11,17-trione. The double bond is designated by the lower-numbered carbon atom, i.e. &quot;Δ4-&quot; or &quot;4-ene&quot; means the double bond between positions 4 and 5. The saturation of carbons of a parent steroid can be done by adding &quot;dihydro-&quot; prefix, i.e., a saturation of carbons 4 and 5 of testosterone with two hydrogen atoms is 4,5α-dihydrotestosterone or 4,5β-dihydrotestosterone. Generally, when there is no ambiguity, one number of a hydrogen position from a steroid with a saturated bond may be omitted, leaving only the position of the second hydrogen atom, e.g., 5α-dihydrotestosterone or 5β-dihydrotestosterone. The Δ5-steroids are those with a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 and the Δ4 steroids are those with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5.

The abbreviations like &quot;P4&quot; for progesterone and &quot;A4&quot; for androstenedione for refer to Δ4-steroids, while &quot;P5&quot; for pregnenolone and &quot;A5&quot; for androstenediol refer to Δ5-steroids.

The suffix -ol denotes a hydroxy group, while the suffix -one denotes an oxo group. When two or three identical groups are attached to the base structure at different positions, the suffix is indicated as -diol or -triol for hydroxy, and -dione or -trione for oxo groups, respectively. For example, 5α-pregnane-3α,17α-diol-20-one has a hydrogen atom at the 5α position (hence the &quot;5α-&quot; prefix), two hydroxy groups (-OH) at the 3α and 17α positions (hence &quot;3α,17α-diol&quot; suffix) and an oxo group (=O) at the position 20 (hence the &quot;20-one&quot; suffix). However, erroneous use of suffixes can be found, e.g., &quot;5α-pregnan-17α-diol-3,11,20-trione&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] — since it has just one hydroxy group (at 17α) rather than two, then the suffix should be -ol, rather than -diol, so that the correct name to be &quot;5α-pregnan-17α-ol-3,11,20-trione&quot;.

According to the rule set in the Nomenclature of Steroids, the terminal &quot;e&quot; in the parent structure name should be elided before the vowel (the presence or absence of a number does not affect such elision). This means, for instance, that if the suffix immediately appended to the parent structure name begins with a vowel, the trailing &quot;e&quot; is removed from that name. An example of such removal is &quot;5α-pregnan-17α-ol-3,20-dione&quot;, where the last &quot;e&quot; of &quot;pregnane&quot; is dropped due to the vowel (&quot;o&quot;) at the beginning of the suffix -ol. Some authors incorrectly use this rule, eliding the terminal &quot;e&quot; where it should be kept, or vice versa.

The term &quot;11-oxygenated&quot; refers to the presence of an oxygen atom as an oxo (=O) or hydroxy (-OH) substituent at carbon 11. &quot;Oxygenated&quot; is consistently used within the chemistry of the steroids since the 1950s. Some studies use the term &quot;11-oxyandrogens&quot; as an abbreviation for 11-oxygenated androgens, to emphasize that they all have an oxygen atom attached to carbon at position 11. However, in chemical nomenclature, the prefix &quot;oxy&quot; is associated with ether functional groups, i.e., a compound with an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups (R-O-R), therefore, using &quot;oxy&quot; within the name of a steroid class may be misleading. One can find clear examples of &quot;oxygenated&quot; to refer to a broad class of organic molecules containing a variety of oxygen containing functional groups in other domains of organic chemistry, and it is appropriate to use this convention.

Even though &quot;keto&quot; is a standard prefix in organic chemistry, the 1989 recommendations of the Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature discourage the application of the prefix &quot;keto&quot; for steroid names, and favor the prefix &quot;oxo&quot; (e.g., 11-oxo steroids rather than 11-keto steroids), because &quot;keto&quot; includes the carbon that is part of the steroid nucleus and the same carbon atom should not be specified twice.

== Species distribution ==

Steroids are present across all domains of life, including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, steroids are particularly abundant in fungi, plants, and animals.

=== Eukaryotic ===

Eukaryotic cells, encompassing animals, plants, fungi, and protists, are characterized by their complex cellular structures, including a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Sterols, a subgroup of steroids, play crucial roles in maintaining membrane fluidity, supporting cell signaling, and enhancing stress tolerance. These compounds are integral to eukaryotic membranes, where they contribute to membrane integrity and functionality.

During eukaryogenesis—the evolutionary process that gave rise to modern eukaryotic cells—steroids likely facilitated the endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria.

=== Prokaryotic ===

Although sterol biosynthesis is rare in prokaryotes, certain bacteria, including &quot;Methylococcus capsulatus&quot;, specific methanotrophs, myxobacteria, and the planctomycete &quot;Gemmata obscuriglobus&quot;, are capable of producing sterols. In &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot;, sterols are essential for cell viability, but their roles in other bacteria remain poorly understood. 

Prokaryotic sterol synthesis involves the tetracyclic steroid framework, as found in myxobacteria, as well as hopanoids, pentacyclic lipids that regulate bacterial membrane functions. These sterol biosynthetic pathways may have originated in bacteria or been transferred from eukaryotes. 

Sterol synthesis depends on two key enzymes: squalene monooxygenase and oxidosqualene cyclase. Phylogenetic analyses of oxidosqualene cyclase (Osc) suggest that some bacterial Osc genes may have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes, as certain bacterial Osc proteins closely resemble their eukaryotic homologs.

=== Fungal ===
Fungal steroids include the ergosterols, which are involved in maintaining the integrity of the fungal cellular membrane. Various antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B and azole antifungals, utilize this information to kill pathogenic fungi. Fungi can alter their ergosterol content (e.g. through loss of function mutations in the enzymes ERG3 or ERG6, inducing depletion of ergosterol, or mutations that decrease the ergosterol content) to develop resistance to drugs that target ergosterol.

Ergosterol is analogous to the cholesterol found in the cellular membranes of animals (including humans), or the phytosterols found in the cellular membranes of plants. All mushrooms contain large quantities of ergosterol, in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams per 100 grams of dry weight. Oxygen is necessary for the synthesis of ergosterol in fungi.

Ergosterol is responsible for the vitamin D content found in mushrooms; ergosterol is chemically converted into provitamin D2 by exposure to ultraviolet light. Provitamin D2 spontaneously forms vitamin D2. However, not all fungi utilize ergosterol in their cellular membranes; for example, the pathogenic fungal species &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; does not, which has important clinical implications (given the mechanism of action of many antifungal drugs). Using the fungus &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; as an example, other major steroids include ergosta‐5,7,22,24(28)‐tetraen‐3β‐ol, zymosterol, and lanosterol. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; utilizes 5,6‐dihydroergosterol in place of ergosterol in its cell membrane.

=== Plant ===
Plant steroids include steroidal alkaloids found in Solanaceae and Melanthiaceae (specially the genus Veratrum), cardiac glycosides, the phytosterols and the brassinosteroids (which include several plant hormones).

=== Animal ===
Animal steroids include compounds of vertebrate and insect origin, the latter including ecdysteroids such as ecdysterone (controlling molting in some species). Vertebrate examples include the steroid hormones and cholesterol; the latter is a structural component of cell membranes that helps determine the fluidity of cell membranes and is a principal constituent of plaque (implicated in atherosclerosis). Steroid hormones include:
* Sex hormones, which influence sex differences and support reproduction. These include androgens, estrogens, and progestogens.
* Corticosteroids, including most synthetic steroid drugs, with natural product classes the glucocorticoids (which regulate many aspects of metabolism and immune function) and the mineralocorticoids (which help maintain blood volume and control renal excretion of electrolytes)
* Anabolic steroids, natural and synthetic, which interact with androgen receptors to increase muscle and bone synthesis. In popular use, the term &quot;steroids&quot; often refers to anabolic steroids.

== Types ==
===By function===

The major classes of steroid hormones, with prominent members and examples of related functions, are:
* Corticosteroids:
** Glucocorticoids:
*** Cortisol, a glucocorticoid whose functions include immunosuppression
** Mineralocorticoids:
*** Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid that helps regulate blood pressure through water and electrolyte balance
* Sex steroids:
** Progestogens:
*** Progesterone, which regulates cyclical changes in the endometrium of the uterus and maintains a pregnancy
** Androgens:
*** Testosterone, which contributes to the development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics
** Estrogens:
*** Estradiol, which contributes to the development and maintenance of female secondary sex characteristics

Additional classes of steroids include:
* Neurosteroids such as and allopregnanolone
* Bile acids such as taurocholic acid
* Aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents (mainly synthetic) such as pancuronium bromide
* Steroidal antiandrogens (mainly synthetic) such as cyproterone acetate
* Steroidogenesis inhibitors (mainly exogenous) such as alfatradiol
* Membrane sterols such as cholesterol, ergosterol, and various phytosterols
* Toxins such as steroidal saponins and cardenolides/cardiac glycosides

As well as the following class of secosteroids (open-ring steroids):
* Vitamin D forms such as ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, and calcitriol

=== By structure ===
==== Intact ring system ====
Steroids can be classified based on their chemical composition. One example of how MeSH performs this classification is available at the Wikipedia MeSH catalog. Examples of this classification include:

In biology, it is common to name the above steroid classes by the number of carbon atoms present when referring to hormones: C18-steroids for the estranes (mostly estrogens), C19-steroids for the androstanes (mostly androgens), and C21-steroids for the pregnanes (mostly corticosteroids). The classification &quot;17-ketosteroid&quot; is also important in medicine.

The gonane (steroid nucleus) is the parent 17-carbon tetracyclic hydrocarbon molecule with no alkyl sidechains.

==== Cleaved, contracted, and expanded rings ====
Secosteroids (Latin &quot;seco&quot;, &quot;to cut&quot;) are a subclass of steroidal compounds resulting, biosynthetically or conceptually, from scission (cleavage) of parent steroid rings (generally one of the four). Major secosteroid subclasses are defined by the steroid carbon atoms where this scission has taken place. For instance, the prototypical secosteroid cholecalciferol, vitamin D3 (shown), is in the 9,10-secosteroid subclass and derives from the cleavage of carbon atoms C-9 and C-10 of the steroid B-ring; 5,6-secosteroids and 13,14-steroids are similar.

Norsteroids (nor-, L. &quot;norma&quot;; &quot;normal&quot; in chemistry, indicating carbon removal) and homosteroids (homo-, Greek &quot;homos&quot;; &quot;same&quot;, indicating carbon addition) are structural subclasses of steroids formed from biosynthetic steps. The former involves enzymic ring expansion-contraction reactions, and the latter is accomplished (biomimetically) or (more frequently) through ring closures of acyclic precursors with more (or fewer) ring atoms than the parent steroid framework.

Combinations of these ring alterations are known in nature. For instance, ewes who graze on corn lily ingest cyclopamine (shown) and veratramine, two of a sub-family of steroids where the C- and D-rings are contracted and expanded respectively via a biosynthetic migration of the original C-13 atom. Ingestion of these C-nor-D-homosteroids results in birth defects in lambs: cyclopia from cyclopamine and leg deformity from veratramine. A further C-nor-D-homosteroid (nakiterpiosin) is excreted by Okinawan cyanobacteriosponges. e.g., &quot;Terpios hoshinota&quot;, leading to coral mortality from black coral disease. Nakiterpiosin-type steroids are active against the signaling pathway involving the smoothened and hedgehog proteins, a pathway which is hyperactive in a number of cancers.

== Biological significance ==
Steroids and their metabolites often function as signalling molecules (the most notable examples are steroid hormones), and steroids and phospholipids are components of cell membranes. Steroids such as cholesterol decrease membrane fluidity.
Similar to lipids, steroids are highly concentrated energy stores. However, they are not typically sources of energy; in mammals, they are normally metabolized and excreted.

Steroids play critical roles in a number of disorders, including malignancies like prostate cancer, where steroid production inside and outside the tumour promotes cancer cell aggressiveness.

== Biosynthesis and metabolism ==
The hundreds of steroids found in animals, fungi, and plants are made from lanosterol (in animals and fungi; see examples above) or cycloartenol (in other eukaryotes). Both lanosterol and cycloartenol derive from cyclization of the triterpenoid squalene. Lanosterol and cycloartenol are sometimes called protosterols because they serve as the starting compounds for all other steroids.

Steroid biosynthesis is an anabolic pathway which produces steroids from simple precursors. A unique biosynthetic pathway is followed in animals (compared to many other organisms), making the pathway a common target for antibiotics and other anti-infection drugs. Steroid metabolism in humans is also the target of cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins. In humans and other animals the biosynthesis of steroids follows the mevalonate pathway, which uses acetyl-CoA as building blocks for dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).

In subsequent steps DMAPP and IPP conjugate to form farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which further conjugates with each other to form the linear triterpenoid squalene. Squalene biosynthesis is catalyzed by squalene synthase, which belongs to the squalene/phytoene synthase family. Subsequent epoxidation and cyclization of squalene generate lanosterol, which is the starting point for additional modifications into other steroids (steroidogenesis). In other eukaryotes, the cyclization product of epoxidized squalene (oxidosqualene) is cycloartenol.

=== Mevalonate pathway ===

The mevalonate pathway (also called HMG-CoA reductase pathway) begins with acetyl-CoA and ends with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).

DMAPP and IPP donate isoprene units, which are assembled and modified to form terpenes and isoprenoids (a large class of lipids, which include the carotenoids and form the largest class of plant natural products). Here, the activated isoprene units are joined to make squalene and folded into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids, such as cholesterol and ergosterol.
Two classes of drugs target the mevalonate pathway: statins (like rosuvastatin), which are used to reduce elevated cholesterol levels, and bisphosphonates (like zoledronate), which are used to treat a number of bone-degenerative diseases.

=== Steroidogenesis ===


Steroidogenesis is the biological process by which steroids are generated from cholesterol and changed into other steroids. The pathways of steroidogenesis differ among species. The major classes of steroid hormones, as noted above (with their prominent members and functions), are the progestogens, corticosteroids (corticoids), androgens, and estrogens. Human steroidogenesis of these classes occurs in a number of locations:
* Progestogens are the precursors of all other human steroids, and all human tissues which produce steroids must first convert cholesterol to pregnenolone. This conversion is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis, which occurs inside the mitochondrion of the respective tissue. It is catalyzed by the mitochondrial P450scc system.
* Cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone are produced in the adrenal cortex.
* Estradiol, estrone and progesterone are made primarily in the ovary, estriol in placenta during pregnancy, and testosterone primarily in the testes (some testosterone may also be produced in the adrenal cortex).
* Estradiol is converted from testosterone directly (in males), or via the primary pathway DHEA – androstenedione – estrone and secondarily via testosterone (in females).
* Stromal cells have been shown to produce steroids in response to signaling produced by androgen-starved prostate cancer cells.
* Some neurons and glia in the central nervous system (CNS) express the enzymes required for the local synthesis of pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA and DHEAS, &quot;de novo&quot; or from peripheral sources.

=== Alternative pathways ===
In plants and bacteria, the non-mevalonate pathway (MEP pathway) uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates to produce IPP and DMAPP.

During diseases pathways otherwise not significant in healthy humans can become utilized. For example, in one form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia a deficiency in the 21-hydroxylase enzymatic pathway leads to an excess of 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) – this pathological excess of 17-OHP in turn may be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT, a potent androgen) through among others 17,20 Lyase (a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes), 5α-Reductase and 3α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

== Catabolism and excretion ==
Steroids are primarily oxidized by cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes, such as CYP3A4. These reactions introduce oxygen into the steroid ring, allowing the cholesterol to be broken up by other enzymes into bile acids. These acids can then be eliminated by secretion from the liver in bile. The expression of the oxidase gene can be upregulated by the steroid sensor PXR when there is a high blood concentration of steroids. Steroid hormones, lacking the side chain of cholesterol and bile acids, are typically hydroxylated at various ring positions or oxidized at the 17 position, conjugated with sulfate or glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine.

== Isolation, structure determination, and methods of analysis ==

Steroid &quot;isolation&quot;, depending on context, is the isolation of chemical matter required for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation or degradation chemistry, biological testing, and other research needs (generally milligrams to grams, but often more or the isolation of &quot;analytical quantities&quot; of the substance of interest (where the focus is on identifying and quantifying the substance (for example, in biological tissue or fluid). The amount isolated depends on the analytical method, but is generally less than one microgram.

The methods of isolation to achieve the two scales of product are distinct, but include extraction, precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and crystallization. In both cases, the isolated substance is purified to chemical homogeneity; combined separation and analytical methods, such as LC-MS, are chosen to be &quot;orthogonal&quot;—achieving their separations based on distinct modes of interaction between substance and isolating matrix—to detect a single species in the pure sample.

&quot;Structure determination&quot; refers to the methods to determine the chemical structure of an isolated pure steroid, using an evolving array of chemical and physical methods which have included NMR and small-molecule crystallography. &quot;Methods of analysis&quot; overlap both of the above areas, emphasizing analytical methods to determining if a steroid is present in a mixture and determining its quantity.

== Chemical synthesis ==
Microbial catabolism of phytosterol side chains yields C-19 steroids, C-22 steroids, and 17-ketosteroids (i.e. precursors to adrenocortical hormones and contraceptives). The addition and modification of functional groups is key when producing the wide variety of medications available within this chemical classification. These modifications are performed using conventional organic synthesis and/or biotransformation techniques.

=== Precursors ===
====Semisynthesis====
The semisynthesis of steroids often begins from precursors such as cholesterol, phytosterols, or sapogenins. The efforts of Syntex, a company involved in the Mexican barbasco trade, used &quot;Dioscorea mexicana&quot; to produce the sapogenin diosgenin in the early days of the synthetic steroid pharmaceutical industry.

====Total synthesis====
Some steroidal hormones are economically obtained only by total synthesis from petrochemicals (e.g. 13-alkyl steroids). For example, the pharmaceutical Norgestrel begins from methoxy-1-tetralone, a petrochemical derived from phenol.

== Research awards ==
A number of Nobel Prizes have been awarded for steroid research, including:
* 1927 (Chemistry) Heinrich Otto Wieland — Constitution of bile acids and sterols and their connection to vitamins
* 1928 (Chemistry) Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus — Constitution of sterols and their connection to vitamins
* 1939 (Chemistry) Adolf Butenandt and Leopold Ružička — Isolation and structural studies of steroid sex hormones, and related studies on higher terpenes
* 1950 (Physiology or Medicine) Edward Calvin Kendall, Tadeus Reichstein, and Philip Hench — Structure and biological effects of adrenal hormones
* 1965 (Chemistry) Robert Burns Woodward — In part, for the synthesis of cholesterol, cortisone, and lanosterol
* 1969 (Chemistry) Derek Barton and Odd Hassel — Development of the concept of conformation in chemistry, emphasizing the steroid nucleus
* 1975 (Chemistry) Vladimir Prelog — In part, for developing methods to determine the stereochemical course of cholesterol biosynthesis from mevalonic acid via squalene

<text>The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Commission. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has since then undergone several changes to reduce the EEC budget cost (from 73% in 1985, to 37% in 2017) and consider rural development in its aims. It has however, been criticised on the grounds of its cost, its environmental, and humanitarian effects.

==Overview==

The CAP is often explained as the result of a political compromise between France and Germany: German industry would have access to the French market; in exchange, Germany would help pay for France&#x27;s farmers. The CAP has always been a difficult area of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has continued to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament have to agree to any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change for the first time in 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP. Outside Brussels proper, the impact of the powerful farming lobby has been a factor in determining EU agricultural policy since the earliest days of integration.

In recent times change has been more forthcoming because of external trade demands and intrusion in agricultural affairs by other parts of the EU policy framework, such as consumer advocate working groups and the environmental departments of the Union. In addition, Euroscepticism in states such as Denmark (and formerly the UK) is fed in part by the CAP, which Eurosceptics consider detrimental to their economies.

Proponents claim that the CAP is an exceptional economic sector as it protects the &quot;rural way of life&quot; although it is recognized that it affects world poverty.
The policy has evolved significantly since it was created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy.

CAP has been divided into two &#x27;pillars&#x27;:
* Agricultural production support and common organization of markets (I pillar, known otherwise earlier as the &#x27;agricultural guarantee&#x27; section)
* Rural development policy (II pillar, otherwise the &#x27;agricultural structural policy&#x27; pillar, known earlier as the &#x27;agricultural guidance&#x27; section).

Accordingly, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) of the EU, which initially used to fund the CAP as a whole, has been replaced in 2007 with two separate funds, one for each of the two pillars:
* the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and
* the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD, a structural fund).

CAP reforms have steadily lowered its share in the EU budget: in 1980 it accounted for more than 70% of the EU expenditure while in 2021 it accounted for less than 25%. In 2019 France was the biggest beneficiary of the policy by 17.3%, followed by Spain with 12.4% and Germany (11.2%), Italy (10.4%), Poland (8.1%) and the UK (7.2%). The 2003 reform introduced the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) or as it is known as well the Single Farm Payment (SFP). The most recent reform was made in 2013 by Commissioner Dacian Cioloș and applies for the period 2014 to 2020.

Since 1970, a separate Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been in place for the EU fisheries and fish market, with its own separate structural policy fund established as a spin-off from the EAGGF in 1993 (currently operating under the name European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund or EMFAF), while the fish market interventions have remained financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.

== Agricultural production support and common organization of markets (I pillar) ==
This part of CAP is financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF). Each country can choose if the payment will be established at the farm level or at the regional level. Farmers receiving the SFP have the flexibility to produce any commodity on their land except fruit, vegetables and table potatoes. In addition, they are obliged to keep their land in good agricultural and environmental condition (cross-compliance). Farmers have to respect environmental, food safety, phytosanitary and animal welfare standards. This is a penalty measure: if farmers do not respect these standards, their payment will be reduced.

The direct aids and market related expenditure made up 31% of the total EU budget in 2010. Together with 11% for Rural Development, the total CAP budget took 42% of the total EU budget The CAP budget shrank relatively from 75% in 1984 to 37% of the total EU budget in 2017.

Intervention mechanisms diminished significantly, for instance the Commission only intervened on: common wheat, butter, and skimmed milk powder. The Health Check of the CAP agreed in November 2008 added on a number of measures to help the farmers to respond better to signals from the markets and to face new challenges. Among a range of measures, the agreement abolished arable set-aside, increased milk quotas gradually leading up to their abolition in 2015, and converted market intervention into a genuine safety net. Ministers also agreed to increase modulation, whereby direct payments to farmers were reduced and the money transferred to the Rural Development Fund.

Milk quotas expired in April 2015. To prepare the dairy farmers for this transition, a &#x27;soft landing&#x27; was ensured by increasing quotas by one per cent every year between 2009–10 and 2013–14. For Italy, the 5 per cent increase was introduced immediately in 2009–10. In 2009–10 and 2010–11, farmers who exceed their milk quotas by more than 6 per cent had to pay a levy 50 per cent higher than the normal penalty.

===Production and market sectors covered by the CAP===
The common agricultural policy price intervention covers only certain agricultural products:
* cereal, rice, potatoes and flour
* cooking oil
* energy crops, vegetable oil fuel, biodiesel, bioethanol
* animal feed stuffs and dried fodder
* milk and milk products (such as condensed milk, powder milk, butter, cheese, whey, buttermilk, cream, yoghurt, kefir)
* grapes, wine, vinegar, cider
* honey
* beef and veal, poultry meat and eggs, pig meat, sheep / lamb meat and goat meat
* sugar
* fruit and vegetables (including cultivated mushrooms)
* cotton
* peas, chickpea, lentil, field beans, soybean
* sweet lupins
* olives
* flax seeds
* flax fibers
* silkworms
* hemp
* tobacco
* hops
* seeds
* animal semen, egg cells and embryos
* flowers and live plants

Fish, Molluscs and crustaceans are covered by the separate Common Fisheries Policy.

The coverage of products in the external trade regime is more extensive than the coverage of the CAP regime. This is to limit competition between EU products and alternative external goods (for example, lychee juice could potentially compete with orange juice).

===Objectives===
The objectives, set out in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, are as follows:
# to increase productivity, by promoting technical progress and ensuring the optimum use of the factors of production, in particular labor;
# to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural Community;
# to stabilize markets;
# to secure availability of supplies;
# to provide consumers with food at reasonable prices.

The CAP recognized the need to take account of the social structure of agriculture and of the structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions and to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees.

CAP is an integrated system of measures that works by maintaining commodity price levels within the EU and by subsidizing production. There are a number of mechanisms:
*Import levies are applied to specified goods imported into the EU. These are set at a level to raise the World market price up to the EU target price. The target price is chosen as the maximum desirable price for those goods within the EU.
*Import quotas are used as a means of restricting the amount of food being imported into the EU. Some non-member countries have negotiated quotas allowing them to sell particular goods within the EU without tariffs. This notably applies to countries that had a traditional trade link with a member country.
*An internal intervention price is set. If the internal market price falls below the intervention level then the EU will buy up goods to raise the price to the intervention level. The intervention price is set lower than the target price. The internal market price can only vary in the range between the intervention price and target price.
*Direct subsidies are paid to farmers. This was originally intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies. Subsidies were generally paid on the area of land growing a particular crop, rather than on the total amount of crop produced. Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of flat-rate payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more freedom to choose for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the economic incentive to overproduce.
*Production quotas and &#x27;set-aside&#x27; payments were introduced in an effort to prevent overproduction of some foods (for example, milk, grain, wine) that attracted subsidies well in excess of market prices. The need to store and dispose of excess produce was wasteful of resources and brought the CAP into disrepute. A secondary market evolved, especially in the sale of milk quotas, while some farmers made imaginative use of &#x27;set-aside&#x27;, for example, setting aside land that was difficult to farm. Currently set-aside has been suspended, subject to further decision about its future, following rising prices for some commodities and increasing interest in growing bio-fuels.

The change in subsidies was intended to be completed by 2011, but individual governments had some freedom to decide how the new scheme would be introduced. The UK government decided to run a dual system of subsidies in England, each year transferring a larger proportion of the total payment to the new scheme. Payments under the old scheme were frozen at their levels averaged over 2002–2003 and reduced each subsequent year. This allowed farmers in England a period where their income was maintained, but which they could use to change farm practices in accord with the new regime. Other governments chose to wait, and change the system in one go at the latest possible time. Governments also had limited discretion to continue to direct a small proportion of the total subsidy to support specific crops. Alterations to the qualifying rules meant that many small landowners became eligible to apply for grants and the Rural Payments Agency in England received double the previous number of applications (110,000).

The CAP also aims to promote legislative harmonization within the Community. Differing laws in member countries can create problems for anyone seeking to trade between countries. Examples are regulations on permitted preservatives or Food coloring, labelling regulations, use of hormones or other drugs in livestock intended for human consumption and disease control, animal welfare regulations. The process of removing all hidden legislative barriers to trade is still incomplete.
== Rural development policy (structural policy, II pillar) ==

Since 2000, the &quot;second pillar&quot; of the CAP, the EU rural development policy has been in effect, financed since 2007 from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, one of the five European Structural and Investment Funds. This policy aims to promote the economic, social and environmental development of the countryside. Its budget, 11% of the total EU budget, has been allocated along three axes. The first axis focuses on improving the competitiveness of the farm and forestry sector through support for restructuring, development and innovation. The second one concerns the improvement of the environment and the countryside through support for land management as well as helping to fight climate change. Such projects could for example concern preserving water quality, sustainable land management, planting trees to prevent erosion and floods. The third axis concerns improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity. The policy also provided support to the Leader rural development methodology, under which Local Action Groups designed and carried out local development strategies for their area. Member States distribute &quot;second pillar&quot; funds through actions of national and regional rural development programmes.

Rural development, the second pillar of CAP, is a vitally important policy area in the European Union. It works to improve aspects of the economic, environmental and social situation of the EU&#x27;s rural areas. Rural regions cover 57% of the EU territory and 24% of the EU population. Together with intermediate regions they comprise 91% of the EU territory and 59% of the total EU population. Across the EU, the dimensions of the rural-urban territorial vary – from countries with an explicitly defined rural character (such as Ireland, Sweden, Finland, etc.) to Member States that tend to be more urbanised (such as the Benelux countries, Malta).

The policy works essentially through seven-year rural development programmes (RDPs) – which operate at either national or regional level. These are funded from the EU budget, national/regional budgets and private sources. Rural Development policy targets rural areas as a whole, with a focus on ensuring the competitiveness of farms and forestry, delivering sustainable management of natural resources and climate action as well as create growth and jobs in rural areas.

=== Budget ===
Rural development policy is financed by three categories of funding:
* public money from the EU budget – i.e. from the EAFRD
* public money from national/regional budgets – depending on whether the programme is national or regional
* private money – in some cases, beneficiaries have to provide some funding themselves (from their own resources, a bank loan etc.)

The expected total public spending (EU + national + regional) on rural development policy in the period between 2014 and 2020 is EUR 161 billion.

=== Rural development objectives and priorities 2014–2020 ===
The three objectives and overall purpose of the CAP include:
* fostering the competitiveness of agriculture;
* ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources, and climate action;
* achieving a balanced territorial development of rural economies and communities, including the creation and maintenance of employment.

However, in practical terms RDPs are drawn up with reference to six more specific priorities, which are further divided into more detailed focus areas.

# Knowledge transfer &amp; innovation in agriculture, forestry &amp; rural areas
# Farm viability / competitiveness, sustainable management of forests
# Food chain organization, animal welfare, risk management in agriculture
# Ecosystems related to agriculture and forestry
# Resource efficiency, low-carbon / climate-resilient economy
# Social inclusion, poverty reduction, economic development

=== National and regional rural development programs ===
There is a total of 118 Rural Development Programs(RDP) in the EU. In most Member States there is a national program which covers the entire territory but in some countries there are several programs, most often linked to regions: France (30), Spain(22), Italy(23), Germany(15), Portugal(3), United Kingdom(4), Belgium(2), Finland(2).

==== Designing rural development programs ====
A given RDP links the priorities of rural development policy to the situation on its territory via a SWOT analysis. 
The RDP then sets out a selection of measures drawn from the Rural Development Regulation to address the priorities in the appropriate way.

A measure is essentially a set of one types of activity, project, investment etc. which may be funded within a RDP to achieve the priorities of rural development policy.

For example, the measure Investments in physical assets as set out in the Rural development Regulation allows support for:
* Investments in farms to improve their performance;
* Investments in processing and marketing (i.e. not necessarily only for farmers);
* Investments in farm- or forest-level infrastructure; and
* &quot;Non-productive&quot; (i.e. primarily environmental) investments. Measure descriptions in the EU Rural Development Regulation give information of varying detail (according to the measure) about who is potentially eligible for support, what sorts of activity etc. can be supported, and whether there are limits on how much support may be offered.

MS follow the rules for a given measure but, within this framework, still enjoy considerable flexibility about how they use it. For example, a MS might choose to make the measure Investments in physical assets available in its RDP, but only with regard to environmental investments.

==== Use of targets ====
In explaining how it will use the various measures together to address the priorities / focus areas of rural development policy within its RDP, the MS / region set various targets against these.
The nature of the target varies according to the focus area. For example, against focus area 5A – Increasing efficiency in water use by agriculture – the standard target indicator is the percentage of the Irrigation area in the program area which is expected to switch to more efficient irrigation equipment as a result of rural development support.

==== Development, approval and amendments ====
A MS / region draws up its RDP in close consultation with a wide range of interested parties, including bodies representing Civil society.
The MS / region submits its RDP to the Commission for analysis. The Commission approves the RDP when satisfied concerning its legality and quality (usually after several months of detailed discussion with the MS concerned).

RDPs usually need to be amended several times during their seven-year life, to keep them as relevant, effective and efficient as possible – in light of changing circumstances and the findings of monitoring and evaluation. Program amendments which go beyond surface details require the Commission&#x27;s approval.

==== Project selection ====
When a RDP has been drawn up and approved, it is advertised.
People, businesses etc. which would like to receive support for projects apply for it. Provided that they are eligible for the type of support in question (according to the RDP), they may be selected for support on the basis of objective selection criteria .
* Example: In a given RDP, a MS has decided to offer support for environmental investments in forests under the measure &quot;Investments in forest area development&quot;. The measure as set out in the Rural Development Regulation allows a wide range of entities to be eligible for support. The MS decides to keep this broad approach in terms of eligibility, but to give priority to &quot;private forest-holders&quot;. At the moment when projects are selected for support, therefore, extra selection &quot;points&quot; will be awarded to applications from private forest-holders. This approach would be announced in overview in the RDP itself, but worked out in detail in subsequent national implementing rules.

==== Monitoring and evaluation ====
Monitoring is essentially about tracking how fast, and in what way, RDPs are being implemented – with reference to financial data and other indicators.
RDPs are monitored continuously. Within this process, program authorities must each send an annual implementation report for each program by 30 June every year, starting in 2016 and ending in 2024.
Evaluation involves rather deeper analysis (especially of effectiveness, efficiency and impact). The key stages are:
* Ex ante evaluation: Drawn up under the responsibility of the relevant program authority, this is submitted to the Commission at the same time as the program, and assesses the program&#x27;s quality.
* Evaluation during the programming period (in enhanced Annual Implementation reports 2017 and 2019 in particular): MS arrange for this to be done on the basis of an evaluation plan. The Commission may also carry out evaluations if it wishes.
* Ex post evaluation: Drawn up under the responsibility of the relevant program authority, this is submitted to the Commission by the end of 2024.
* Synthesis of evaluations: Syntheses at Union level of the ex ante and ex post evaluations are undertaken under the responsibility of the Commission and completed by 31 December of the year following the submission of the relevant evaluations.
The monitoring and evaluation processes draw on a range of indicators concerning financial execution, outputs, results and impact.

==== Ex ante conditionalities ====
Ex ante conditionalities (EACs) help to ensure that MS have set the right background conditions for spending funds effectively and efficiently through their program.
Some EACs are &quot;general&quot; in the sense that they apply to all of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIFs).
* Example: MS must have in place arrangements for applying EU public procurement law in the fields covered by the ESIF Funds. This is important because many program will allocate significant sums to projects covered by public procurement rules.
* Other EACS are &quot;fund-specific&quot; (they do not apply to all ESIF Funds). The EAFRD has its own EACs. 
* Example: MS must have set out standards for Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) in national law and must specify them in their RDPs. 
MS declare their fulfilment or non-fulfilment of EACs in their programs, and summaries it in their Partnership Agreement. The Commission checks this information.

When a MS does not meet some or all EACs, usually the MS is required to follow an action plan which allows it to meet the EAC by the end of 2016.

==== Performance reserve ====
6% of the EAFRD financial resources allocated to a given RDP are placed in a performance reserve, which is provisionally divided up between some or all of the rural development priorities.
After receipt of the 2019 annual implementation reports, the Commission checks which priorities have &quot;performed well&quot; – i.e. against which priorities particular &quot;milestones&quot; (key targets) have been met.

Where the milestones of a given priority have been met, the sum from the performance reserve initially allocated to that priority is confirmed.
Where the milestones of a given priority have not been met, the sum initially allocated from the performance reserve is transferred to priorities whose milestones have been met. This approach is intended to focus minds more sharply on achieving results.

==Criticism==
The CAP has been roundly criticized by many diverse interests since its inception. Criticism has been wide-ranging, and even the European Commission has long acknowledged the numerous defects of the policy. In May 2007, Sweden became the first EU country to take the position that all EU farm subsidies should be abolished, except those related to environmental protection.

===Anti-development===
Many developing countries are highly dependent on agriculture. The FAO finds that agriculture provides for the livelihood of 70% of the world&#x27;s poorest people. As such, the subsidies in the CAP are charged with preventing developing countries from exporting agricultural produce to the EU on a level playing field. The WTO Doha Development Round, which intended to increase global development, has stalled due to the developed countries&#x27; refusal to remove agricultural subsidies.

A review of post-2013 proposal by Prof. Alan Matthews underlines the lack of ambition in tackling the issue. &quot;This CAP reform was not intended to address the trade barriers used to keep some EU market prices higher than world market levels. The EU has reduced the effect of these barriers for a number of developing countries through extending the scope of preferential access under various trade agreements, and a further reduction is being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round. Nonetheless, developing countries will be disappointed that the opportunity was not taken in this reform to set a final date for the ending of export subsidies. A more ambitious CAP reform, in which the targeting of direct payments was pursued more insistently and coupled payments were phased out, would also have a greater effect in removing the remaining distortions caused by the CAP to world markets.&quot; In another study, Prof. Matthews showed how linking EU farm subsidies to goals such as environmental protection could help farmers in poor countries, although much depends on the size of the payments and how they are made.

At the same time, however, the EU remains the world&#x27;s biggest importer of farm products from developing countries. On average, over the period 2006–2008, the EU has imported €53 billion worth of goods. This is more than the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand combined. This is further encouraged by a preferential market access agreement for products from developing countries. Today, around 71% of the EU&#x27;s agricultural imports originate from developing countries. The &#x27;Everything but Arms&#x27; program, gives the world&#x27;s 49 least-developed countries duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market. Under the Economic Partnership Agreements, countries from the African, Caribbean and Pacific group enjoy full duty-free and quota free access.

=== Funding of animal farming ===
A study reported in 2024 that 80% of the CAP&#x27;s subsidies in 2013 supported emissions-intensive animal products, a ratio that hasn&#x27;t significantly changed since. Critics argue that these funds could have been better allocated to promote a transition toward more sustainable, plant-based food systems. According to Olga Kikou, the CAP also created conditions for overproduction, which incentivizes intensive animal farming and is incompatible with animal welfare. 

===Oversupply and its redistribution===
To perpetuate the viability of European agriculture in its current state, the CAP-mandated demand for certain farm produce is set at a high level compared with demand in the free market (see ). This leads to the European Union purchasing millions of tons of surplus output every year at the stated guaranteed market price, and storing this produce in large quantities (leading to what critics have called &#x27;butter mountains&#x27; and &#x27;wine lakes&#x27;), before selling the produce wholesale to developing nations. In 2007 in response to a parliamentary written question the UK government revealed that over the preceding year the EU Public Stock had amassed &quot;13,476,812 tones of cereal, rice, sugar and milk products and 3,529,002 hectoliters of alcohol/wine&quot;, although the EU has claimed this level of oversupply is unlikely to be repeated. This point was actually proven in January 2009, where the EU had a store of 717,810 tons of cereals, 41,422 tons of sugar and a 2.3 million hectoliter wine surplus, showing that the stocks had diminished dramatically.

The food crisis in 2008, which saw the stocks empty out and the prices skyrocket, even introduced a popular demand for the introduction of emergency stocks of agricultural produce in the EU, which would help stabilize prices both on the very volatile markets. In 2010, the European Commission announced its intention to sell out of its cereal stocks to stabilize the situation after a Russian grain export ban had stung world markets, sending wheat prices to two-year highs and sparked worries of a crisis in global food supplies that could spark widespread strains and protests.

In 2010, the EU decided to use existing intervention stocks (cereals, milk powder and limited quantities of butter) for its &quot;Food Aid for the Needy&quot; scheme for 2011. An estimated 13 million poor Europeans benefit from this scheme.

Parts of the EU stocks are exported with the use of export subsidies. It is argued that many African and Asian dairy, tomato, grain and poultry farmers cannot keep up with cheap competition from Europe, thus their incomes can no longer provide for their families. At the same time, many urbanized families in the developing world benefit from the relatively cheaper products stemming from Europe.

For dairy products, export subsidies rose in 2009 after having been stopped in 2008. In 2009, the main recipients of dairy products that benefited from export subsidies were: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Nigeria.

According to the 2003 Human Development Report the average dairy cow in the year 2000 under the European Union received $913 in subsidies annually, while an average of $8 per human being was sent in aid to Sub-Saharan Africa.

The 2005 Human Development Report states &quot;The basic problem to be addressed in the WTO negotiations on agriculture can be summarized in three words: rich country subsidies. In the last round of world trade negotiations rich countries promised to cut agricultural subsidies. Since then, they have increased them&quot;. Several reports from the latest negotiations in the WTO, however, contradict the theory of the 2005 HDR report. On 29 July 2008, the WTO negotiations in the Doha round finally collapsed because of differences between the US, India and China over agricultural trade.

===Artificially high food prices===
CAP price intervention has been criticized for creating artificially high food prices throughout the EU. High import tariffs (estimated at 18–28%) have the effect of keeping prices high by restricting competition by non-EU producers. It is estimated that public support for farmers in OECD countries costs a family of four on average nearly US$1,000 per year in higher prices and taxes. The European Commission has responded that the average EU household today spends 15% of its budget on food, compared to 30% in 1960.

The recent moves away from intervention buying, subsidies for specific crops, reductions in export subsidies, have changed the situation somewhat. In the past years intervention has been reduced or abolished in all sectors. After two decades of significant CAP reforms, farmers can now respond to market signals and increase production to react to the higher prices. Although the new decoupled payments were aimed at environmental measures, many farmers have found that without these payments their businesses would not be able to survive. With food prices dropping over the past thirty years in real terms, many products have been making less than their cost of production when sold at the farm gate.

===Public health at the peril of agricultural policies===
Public health professionals have also leveled criticism at the CAP and its support regimes, arguing that agricultural policy often disregards health. It is evident that supply outputs are generating widespread public health issues of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardio-vascular disease (CVD), cancer and type II diabetes. Diet is one of the major modifiable determinants in promoting or preventing chronic disease, and agricultural products have a major influence on the disease risk factors.

Initial criticism emerged in the early 2000s regarding the production orientation of the CAP and the need for decoupling due to the disjointed nature of agricultural production policy in relation to consumption (and thus nutrition). The arguments were re-enforced at the 2001 European Health Forum Gastein on the CAP, which made explicit – to policy makers – the link between nutrient quality of diets and agricultural policy. The Forum also identified opportunities to align the CAP to health objectives, more specifically by encouraging changes to dietary behaviour through adjusting CAP support.

Since 2008, under the leadership of the European Public Health and Agriculture Consortium (EPHAC), the public health nutrition narrative has gained traction in policy circles. Although agricultural policy-makers are beginning to realize the arguments for upstream health intervention, practical measures remain politically unpalatable. EPHAC maintains that agricultural policies can be used to internalize the health externalities of diet-related ill-health and improve population, society-wide public health nutrition.

Health groups have become increasingly vocal in their call for agricultural policies to contribute towards resolving the consumption problems of food; such as, excessive intake of saturated fatty acids (FSA), sugar and salt, or under-consumption of vitamins (leading to hypovitaminosis) and minerals. More attention should be paid, it is argued, on intervention policies upstream, at the primary food production and processing stages, to influence nutritional quality and the structural determinants of food choice, including; availability, accessibility and price.

===Hurting smaller farms===
Although most policy makers in Europe agree that they want to promote &quot;family farms&quot; and smaller scale production, the CAP in fact rewards larger producers. Because the CAP has traditionally rewarded farmers who produce more, larger farms have benefited much more from subsidies than smaller farms. For example, a farm with 1000 hectares, earning an additional €100 per hectare will make an additional €100,000, while a 10 hectare farm will only make an extra €1000, disregarding economies of scale. As a result, most CAP subsidies have made their way to large scale farmers.

Since the 2003 reforms subsidies have been linked to the size of farms, so farmers get the same for a hectare of land regardless of how much land they own. So while subsidies allow small farms to exist, large farms tend to get the larger share of the subsidies. With the 2008 Health Check of the CAP, a first step was taken towards limiting CAP payments to very large landowners.

The European Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development Dacian Cioloş in his Public Hearing upon his nomination has showed his concern in small farms: &quot;small holdings represent an important share, not only in the new Member States but also in South Europe&quot;. He has emphasized that a structural policy is needed &quot;to modernize&quot; small farms and to &quot;develop existing opportunities in local markets&quot;, where there is &quot;high demand for local products&quot;.

===Environmental problems===
A common view is that the CAP has traditionally promoted a large expansion in agricultural production. At the same time it has allowed farmers to employ un-ecological ways of increasing production, such as the indiscriminate use of fertilizers and pesticides, with serious environmental consequences. However, a total re-focusing of the payment scheme in 2004 now puts the environment at the centre of farming policy. By linking the payments to farmers to a number of strict environmental standards (among others) in the so-called cross compliance scheme, farmers will have to face cuts in their subsidy levels if they don&#x27;t meet the strict environmental requirements.

In 2010, the EU announced that 31% of the €5 billion that was earmarked the new (mainly environmental) challenges in agriculture would be spent on protecting and promoting biodiversity in the European countryside. This money is part of the EU rural development policy, which is supporting agri-environmental projects throughout the Member States.

The CAP has furthermore been criticized due to its effect on farmland bird populations. Between 1980 and 2009, the farmland bird population has decreased from 600 million to 300 million, implying a loss of 50%. Among the species that have been hit hardest are the starling and the tree sparrow, which have both declined by 53%. The removal of hedgerows and ploughing over meadows are two significant factors that may have contributed to more efficient farming, but that also caused a decrease in farmland birds&#x27; habitats.

In England, farmers have been lauded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds because the five most threatened bumblebees have made a comeback to the English nature due to the agri-environmental schemes. In Germany, support for extensive farming and biotope management helps maintain habitat for rare species such as orchids and butterflies. In Hungary, a special scheme was launched to protect the great bustard, maybe the world&#x27;s heaviest flying bird, which needs areas with minimal disturbance and an abundant supply of insects to breed. In Cyprus, agri-environment schemes support the maintenance of traditional trees and bushes that are a natural habitat for the islands and likely to be of benefit to farmland birds in Cyprus.

Rules instituted in 2015 barring or reducing payments for farmed land above threshold densities of trees or canopy cover have been attacked as having perverse consequences for mature trees, biodiversity, soil erosion and downstream flooding.

The European Court of Auditors raised concerns in 2024 about the lack of alignment between the CAP and EU&#x27;s climate objectives in the Green Deal.

===Equity among member states===

Some countries in the EU have larger agricultural sectors than others, notably France and Spain, and consequently receive more money under the CAP. Countries such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have particularly urbanized populations and rely very little on agriculture as part of their economy (in the United Kingdom agriculture employs 1.6% of the total workforce and in the Netherlands 2.0%). The UK therefore receives less than half what France gets, despite a similar sized economy and population. Other countries receive more benefit from different areas of the EU budget. Overall, certain countries make net contributions, notably Germany (the largest contribution overall) and the Netherlands (the biggest contribution per person), but also the UK and France. The largest per capita beneficiaries are Greece and Ireland.

Another aspect is difference between older Western European and newer Central and Eastern member states, due to transitional arrangements the latter received smaller payments. In 2013 payments per hectare were 527 euros in Greece and only 89 euros in Latvia. In compensation the newer members were allowed to provide national farm aid. In March 2018 EU agriculture ministers failed to achieve consensus on a declaration about future of CAP, with ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia demanding fully equal subsidies across the union.

===Cotton subsidies===
In spite of these declarations, the EU Commission proposed the continuation of cotton subsidies, coupled to production. The coupling of the subsidy means that they will continue to have significant trade-distorting effect, most notably on West African farmers who are unable to compete with subsidised cotton.
The Communication on the future of the CAP does not mention the cotton sector. Nevertheless, the most trade-distorting subsidies to cotton production have already been eliminated in the 2004 reform. The current EU cotton production corresponds to 1% of global cotton production and its effect on the evolution of world market prices is therefore negligible. On the other hand, the EU is by far the largest provider of development assistance to cotton. In the framework of the EU-Africa Partnership on Cotton the EU has made available more than €320 million. The EU market for cotton is already duty-free and quota-free and there are no export subsidies for cotton.

===UK rebate and the CAP===
The UK would have been contributing more money to the EU than any other EU member state, except that the UK government negotiated a special annual UK rebate in 1984. Due to the way the rebate is funded, France pays the largest share of the rebate (31%), followed by Italy (24%) and Spain (14%).

The discrepancy in CAP funding is a cause of some consternation in the UK. , France received more than double the CAP funds received by the UK (see diagram). This is a net benefit to France of €6.37 billion, compared to the UK. This is largely a reflection of the fact that France has more than double the land area of the UK. In comparison, the UK budget rebate for 2005 is scheduled to be approx. €5.5 billion. The popular view in the UK (as, for example, set forth in the tabloid press) is that if the UK rebate were reduced with no change to the CAP, then the UK would be paying money to keep the French farming sector in business – to many people in the UK, this would be seen as unfair.

If the rebate were removed without changes to the CAP then the UK would pay a net contribution of 14 times that of the French (In 2005 EU budget terms). The UK would make a net contribution of €8.25 billion compared to the current contribution of €2.75 billion, versus a current French net contribution of €0.59 billion.

In December 2005 the UK agreed to give up approximately 20% of the rebate for the period 2007–2013, on condition that the funds did not contribute to CAP payments, were matched by other countries&#x27; contributions and were only for the new member states. Spending on the CAP remained fixed, as had previously been agreed. Overall, this reduced the proportion of the budget spent on the CAP. It was agreed that the European Commission should conduct a full review of all EU spending.

===Economic sustainability===
Experts such as Prof. Alan Matthews believed &#x27;greening&#x27; measures in the EU&#x27;s proposed €418-billion post-2013 farm policy could lower the bloc&#x27;s agricultural production potential by raising farm input costs by €5 billion, or around 2 per cent.

===Target population===
Only 5.4% of EU&#x27;s population works on farms, and the farming sector is responsible for 1.6% of the GDP of the EU (2005). The number of European farmers is decreasing every year by 2%. Additionally, most Europeans live in cities, towns, and suburbs, not rural areas.

The 2007-2008 world food price crisis renewed calls for farm subsidies to be removed in light of evidence that farm subsidies contribute to rocketing food prices, which has a particularly detrimental effect on developing countries.

== Origins and history ==
=== Origins ===
In the late 1950s to late 1960s, there was no example of a successful agricultural integration in Europe. There were only a few pre-existing legal stipulations that were considered, &quot;weak, vague and highly underdeveloped&quot;. As part of building a common market, tariffs on agricultural products would have to be removed. However, the political clout of farmers, and the sensitivity of the issue in nations that still remembered severe food shortages during and after the Second World War, delayed the CAP and its implementation for many years. Nevertheless, the European Economic Community (EEC) offered an integrated agriculture policy to France, to help France to ratify the Treaty of Rome. In due course, article 39 was created in a set of five social and economic objectives.

The Spaak Report of 1956 stated that a European common market that excluded agriculture was unthinkable. It argued that security of food supply was paramount and raised a series of questions about agriculture that needed to be answered by policy-makers. The Treaty of Rome, signed in March 1957, established the European Economic Community (EEC) and it was mainly due to the French pressure that the Treaty included agriculture. However, due to disagreements within the Six over agricultural policy, the articles on agriculture were vague and policy making was left until after the Treaty had been signed.

Article 39.1 of the Treaty set out the objectives of the CAP: to increase productivity through technical progress and the best use of the factors of production (such as labour); to ensure a fair standard of living for communities employed in agriculture; to stabilize markets; to secure the availability of supplies; and to enforce fair prices. Article 39.2 stated that policy makers must take into account three factors: the circumstances of each agricultural activity due to the social structure of agricultural communities and the inequalities between richer and poorer regions; the need to act gradually to allow agriculture sufficient time to adjust; and to remember that agriculture was heavily integrated in the wider economy.

Article 40 provided for the common organisation of markets and common prices, along with a fund to pay for it. Article 41 allowed for the introduction of additional measures to implement Article 39, such as the co-ordination of vocational education and research, the &quot;dissemination of agricultural knowledge&quot; and the encouragement of consumption of certain goods. Article 42 allowed the Council of the Community to decide how far the regulations on competition could apply to agriculture. This Article also allowed them to grant aid.

During 3–12 July 1958 in Stresa, the Community held an agricultural conference attended by agricultural ministers from member states and the President of the European Commission, Walter Hallstein, along with observers representing agriculture. Three working parties at the conference investigated: the current state of agriculture and the agricultural policies of member states; the short-term effects of the implementation of the Rome Treaty; and the long-term aims of the CAP. In a speech to the conference, Hallstein complained of urbanisation that was leading to rural depopulation and he lamented the &quot;clash of cultures&quot; in which rural life and rural values were considered inferior. Hallstein also reflected on the Cold War threat from communism:

It is the core of Europe&#x27;s achievements which is under threat: a whole civilization which rests on the inalienable freedom and dignity of the individual...this tragedy of liberty is also a tragedy of the rural class. Let us look around us, and, alas, we have not far to look; the rural class is its first victim. It is for this reason that we are convinced that the European rural class will count among the most trustworthy pillars of our unified European market. Because its fate is also at stake, and is one of the first threatened. In this room there is no one whose family tree doesn&#x27;t reach back, sooner or later, to farming roots. We know what the rural class means to Europe, not only through its economic values, but also by its moral and social values.

The conference&#x27;s Final Resolution argued for the vital importance of agriculture in economic and social life and expressed their unanimous wish to preserve the character of European farming, which was predominately based on small-size, family holdings. They agreed that it was necessary to help these farms increase their economic capacity and competitiveness. They also advocated structural changes to rationalize and cheapen production, which was intended to improve productivity. The Resolution also included a commitment to a price policy.

Therefore, during 1958–1959, the Commission drafted the CAP and the Assembly commissioned reports into agriculture. The Commission submitted draft proposals in November 1959 (which were debated in the Assembly and by the Economic and Social Committee) and its final report in June 1960. In December the Council agreed to a system of import levies (for grain, sugar, pork, eggs and poultry) and to commodity regimes for agricultural produce. They also introduced the principle of Community Preference in the implementation of the levies and for the negotiation of commercial treaties with outside countries; this ensured that any trade concession granted to an outside country could not weaken the European producer in the Community market.

===Initial years===
In 1962 the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund was founded to provide money for the CAP&#x27;s market regimes. A year later, two arms of the Fund were established, the Guarantee side implemented market and price support and the Guidance part supplied structural aid. A Community regulation of 1964 provided detailed arrangements for the working of the Fund, including for estimating export refunds, the Community&#x27;s main tool for controlling the market. Market regimes had been implemented for most agricultural produce by the end of the decade. An agreement in 1966 facilitated the completion of the single market for agriculture (which came into effect a year later), a single price support system and uniform protection against imports from outside countries. Hallstein hailed this agreement as the single most important stage in forging European unity because it helped to complete the CAP.

The six member states individually strongly intervened in their agricultural sectors, in particular with regard to what was produced, maintaining prices for goods and how farming was organised. The intervention posed an obstacle to free trade in goods while the rules continued to differ from state to state since freedom of trade would contradict the intervention policies. Some members, particularly France, and all farming professional organisations wanted to maintain strong state intervention in agriculture. That could not be achieved unless policies were harmonized and transferred to the European Community level.

By 1962, three major principles had been established to guide the CAP: market unity, community preference and financial solidarity. Since then, the CAP has been a central element in the European institutional system.

In June 1965 negotiations on the CAP came to halt in Brussels when the French delegation of the EEC, under the direction of Charles de Gaulle, decided to pull out of further discussion on the use of foreign levies and national budgets to support a budget for the Community. This was known as the Empty Chair Crisis. Talks resumed after January 1966, but the issue of the Community&#x27;s own resources was only finalized three years later in the agricultural marathon 19–22 December 1969 when the Council adopted that agricultural levies would be allocated to the Community in their entirety and customs duties would be allocated progressively to the Community, in order to avoid excessive disruption of national budgets.

===Early attempts at reform (Mansholt Plan)===
On 21 December 1968, Sicco Mansholt, the European Commissioner for Agriculture, sent a memorandum to the Council of Ministers concerning agricultural reform in the European Community. This long-term plan, also known as the &#x27;1980 Agricultural Programme&#x27; or the &#x27;Report of the Gaichel Group&#x27;, named after the village in Luxembourg in which it had been prepared, laid the foundations for a new social and structural policy for European agriculture.

The Mansholt Plan noted the limits to a policy of price and market support. It predicted the imbalance that would occur in certain markets unless the Community undertook to reduce its land under cultivation by at least five million hectares. Mansholt also noted that the standard of living of farmers had not improved since the implementation of the CAP despite an increase in production and permanent increases in Community expenditure. He, therefore, suggested that production methods should be reformed and modernised and that small farms, which were bound to disappear sooner or later, according to Community experts, should be increased in size. The aim of the Plan was to encourage nearly five million farmers to give up farming. That would make it possible to redistribute their land and increase the size of the remaining family farms. Farms were considered viable if they could guarantee for their owners an average annual income comparable to that of all the other workers in the region. In addition to vocational training measures, Mansholt also provided for welfare programmes to cover retraining and early retirement. Finally, he called on the Member States to limit direct aid to unprofitable farms.

Faced with the increasingly angry reaction of the agricultural community, Mansholt was soon forced to reduce the scope of some of his proposals. Ultimately, the Mansholt Plan was reduced to just three European directives, which, in 1972, concerned the modernisation of agricultural holdings, the cessation of certain agricultural activity and the training of farmers.

===Between Mansholt and MacSharry===
Hurt by the failure of Mansholt, would-be reformers were mostly absent throughout the 1970s, and reform proposals were few and far between. A system called &quot;Agrimoney&quot; was introduced as part of the fledgling EMU project but was deemed a failure and did not stimulate further reforms.

The 1980s was the decade that saw the first true reforms of the CAP, foreshadowing further development from 1992 onwards. The influence of the farming bloc declined, and with it, reformers were emboldened. Environmentalists garnered great support in reforming the CAP, but it was financial matters that ultimately tipped the balance: due to huge overproduction the CAP was becoming expensive and wasteful. There was the introduction of a quota on dairy production in 1984 and, in 1988, a ceiling on EU expenditure to farmers. However, the basis of the CAP remained in place and it was not until 1992 that CAP reformers began to work in earnest.

===Modern reforms===
The current reform issues in EU agriculture are: lowering prices, ensuring food safety and quality, and guaranteeing stability of farmers&#x27; incomes. Other issues are environmental pollution, animal welfare and finding alternative income opportunities for farmers. Some of these issues are the responsibility of the member states.

====The MacSharry reforms (1992)====
In 1992, the MacSharry reforms (named after the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Ray MacSharry) were created to limit rising production, while at the same time adjusting to the trend toward a more free agricultural market. The reforms reduced levels of support by 29% for cereals and 16% for beef. They also created &#x27;set-aside&#x27; payments to withdraw land from production, payments to limit stocking levels, and introduced measures to encourage retirement and afforestation.

Since the MacSharry reforms, cereal prices have been closer to the equilibrium level, there is greater transparency in costs of agricultural support and the &#x27;decoupling&#x27; of income support from production support has begun. However, the administrative complexity involved was seen as inviting fraud, and the associated problems of the CAP were far from being corrected.

One of the factors behind the 1992 reforms was the need to reach agreement with the EU&#x27;s external trade partners at the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks with regards to agricultural subsidies.

====Agenda 2000 (1999)====
The &#x27;Agenda 2000&#x27; reforms divided the CAP into two &#x27;Pillars&#x27;: production support and rural development. Several rural development measures were introduced including diversification, setting up producer groups and support for young farmers. Agri-environment schemes became compulsory for every Member State. The market support prices for cereals, milk and milk products and beef and veal were step-wise reduced while direct coupled payments to farmers were increased. Payments for major arable crops as cereals and oil-seeds were harmonized.

The introduction of the euro in 1999 also ended the use of green exchange rates such as the green pound.

====European Commission Report and decoupling (2003)====
A 2003 report, commissioned by the European Commission, by a group of experts led by Belgian economist André Sapir stated that the budget structure was a &quot;historical relic&quot;. The report suggested a reconsideration of EU policy, redirecting expenditure towards measures intended to increase wealth creation and cohesion of the EU. As a significant proportion of the budget is currently spent on agriculture and there is little prospect of the budget being increased, that would require reducing CAP expenditure. The report largely concerned itself to discussing alternative measures more useful to the EU, rather than discussing the CAP, but it also suggested that farm aid would be administered more effectively by member countries on an individual basis.

The report&#x27;s findings were largely ignored. Instead, CAP spending was kept within the remit of the EU, and France led an effort to agree a fixed arrangement for CAP spending that would not be changed until 2012. It was made possible by advance agreement with Germany. It is that agreement that the UK currently wishes to see reopened, both in its efforts to defend the UK position on the UK rebate and also given that the UK is in favour of lowering barriers to entry for developing nations that are agricultural exporters.

On 26 June 2003, EU farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the CAP, based on &quot;decoupling&quot; subsidies from particular crops. (Member states could choose to maintain a limited amount of specific subsidy.) The new &quot;single farm payments&quot; were subject to &quot;cross-compliance&quot; conditions relating to environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. Many of them were already either good practice recommendations or separate legal requirements regulating farm activities. The aim was to make more money available for environmental quality or animal welfare programmes. The political scientist Peter Nedergaard analysed the 2003 reform on the basis of rational choice theory and stated that, &quot;In order to arrive at an adequate explanation, an account of the policy entrepreneurship on the part of Commissioner Franz Fischler must be given.&quot;

Details of the UK scheme were still being decided at its introductory date of May 2005. Details of the scheme in each member country could be varied subject to outlines issued by the EU. In England, the Single Payment Scheme provided a single flat rate payment of around £230 per hectare for maintaining land in cultivatable condition. In Scotland, payments were based on a historical basis and could vary widely. This scheme allowed for much wider non-production use of land that might still receive the environmental element of the support. Additional payments were available if land was managed in a prescribed environmental manner.

The overall EU and national budgets for subsidy were capped. That prevented the EU being required to spend more on the CAP than its limited budget.

The reforms entered into force in 2004–2005. (Member states could apply for a transitional period delaying the reform in their country to 2007 and phasing in reforms until 2012)

====Sugar regime reform (2005–2006)====

One of the crops subsidized by the CAP was sugar produced from sugar beet; the EU was by far the largest sugar beet producer in the world, with annual production at 17 million metric tons in 2017. That compared to levels produced by Brazil and India, the two largest producers of sugar from sugar cane.

Sugar was to be included in the 1992 MacSherry reform or in the 1999 Agenda 2000 decisions; sugar was also subject to a phase in (to 2009) under the Everything But Arms trade deal giving tariff- and quota-free market access to least developed countries. As of 21 February 2006, the EU decided to reduce the guaranteed price of sugar by 36% over four years, starting in 2006. European production was projected to fall sharply. According to the EU, this was the first serious reform of sugar under the CAP for 40 years. Under the Sugar Protocol to the Lome Convention, nineteen ACP countries export sugar to the EU and would be affected by price reductions on the EU market.

These proposals followed the WTO Appellate Body, largely upholding on 28 April 2005 the initial decision against the EU sugar regime.

The EU abolished sugar quotas in September 2017.

====Reform package 2014====
In 2010 the European Commission discussed the next reform of the CAP, which would coincide with the next financial perspectives package, as from 2014. The Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development Dacian Cioloş, outlined seven major challenges that the future CAP needed to address: food production, globalization, the environment, economic issues, a territorial approach, diversity and simplification. The cited reasons for reform plans included:
* a need to respond to the economic, environmental and territorial challenges faced by agricultural and rural areas today and in the future, and in doing so to better align the CAP to the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
* a need to make the policy more efficient and effective, as well as to further simplify it while maintaining sound financial management and controllability
* making CAP support more equitable and balanced between Member States and farmers and better targeted at active farmers.

The Commission launched the CAP reform process with an extensive public debate on the future of the Cap between April and June 2010, followed by a public conference in July 2010, with around 600 participants. The purpose of the debate was to have different sectors of society taking part. &quot;The Common Agricultural Policy is not just a matter for experts. It&#x27;s a policy for all Europeans&quot;, said Commissioner Cioloş. Based on the wide-ranging public debate, on 18 November 2010, the Commission presented a Communication on &quot;The CAP towards 2020&quot; The Communication Paper outlined three options for the future CAP and launched a consultation with other institutions and stakeholders. Over 500 contributions were received, 44% of which came from the farming and processing sector. These contributions form an integral part of the Impact Assessment of the legal proposals. The impact assessment evaluates alternative scenarios for the evolution of the policy on the basis of extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis

On 12 October 2011 the Commission presented a set of legal proposals to reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2013. Its stated aim is to guarantee European citizens healthy and quality food production, while preserving the environment. According to the proposal, the three broad objectives of the future CAP are: &quot;Viable food production&quot;, &quot;Sustainable management of natural resources&quot; and &quot;Balanced territorial development&quot;, which respond directly to the economic, environmental and territorial balance challenges identified in the Communication and which guide the proposed changes to the CAP instruments.

The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on 1 December 2009, has extended the legislative powers of the European Parliament on agricultural matters, with the EP deciding together with the Council in a procedure known as the co-decision procedure. For the first time both institutions (European Parliament and the council) decided on an equal footing on the new agriculture legislative package. The European Parliament and the council, debated the text. The approval of the different regulations and implementing acts was received by mid-2013. On 26 June 2013 agreement was reached between the European Commission, the Council and the EU Parliament on a new CAP. The CAP reform came into force as from 1 January 2014.

=====New design of direct payments=====
Direct payments contribute to keeping farming in place throughout the EU territory by supporting and stabilizing farmers&#x27; income, thereby ensuring the longer-term economic viability of farms and making them less vulnerable to fluctuations in prices. They also provide basic public goods through their link with cross compliance.

The legal proposals aim to move away from the different systems of the Single Payments Scheme in the EU-15 (which allows for historical references, or a payment per hectare, or a &quot;hybrid&quot; combination of the two) and the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) in most of the EU-12, a new &quot;Basic Payment Scheme&quot; will apply after 2013. This will be subject to &quot;cross compliance&quot; (respecting certain environmental, animal welfare &amp; other rules), as at present, although there are various simplifications to the current requirement. It intends to reduce significantly the discrepancies between the levels of payments obtained between farmers, between regions and between Member States. All Member States will be obliged to move towards a uniform payment per hectare at national or regional level by the start of 2019. In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the national envelopes for direct payments will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more. The gap between the amounts currently foreseen and 90% of the EU-27 average is reduced by one-third.

The reform of direct payments was intended to make them better suited with regard to:
*&quot;Greening&quot;: The legal proposals propose new concepts. Among them is the &quot;greening&quot; of direct payment. To strengthen the environmental sustainability of agriculture and enhance the efforts of farmers, the Commission is proposing to spend 30% of direct payments specifically for the improved use of natural resources. Farmers would be obliged to fulfill certain criteria such as crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pasture, the preservation of environmental reservoirs and landscapes.
*Young farmers: To attract young people (under 40 years) into the farming business, the Commission is proposing that the Basic Payment to new entrant Young Farmers should be topped up by an additional 25% for the first 5 years of installation.
*Small farmers: Any farmer wishing to participate in the Small Farmers Scheme will receive an annual payment fixed by the Member State of between €500 and €1,000, regardless of the farm&#x27;s size. (The figure will either be linked to the average payment per beneficiary, or the national average payment per hectare for 3 ha.). Participants will face less stringent cross-compliance requirements, and be exempt from greening.
*Active farmers: This new definition is aimed to exclude payments to applicants who exercise no real or tangible agricultural activity on their land. The Commission is proposing that payments would not be granted to applicants whose CAP direct payments are less than 5% of total receipts from all non-agricultural activities. This doesn&#x27;t apply to farmers who receive less than €5,000 in direct payments.
*&quot;Capping&quot;: In the autumn of 2007 the European Commission was reported to be considering a proposal to limit subsidies to individual landowners and factory farms to around £300,000. Some factory farms and large estates would be affected in the UK, as there are over 20 farms/estates receiving £500,000 or more from the EU. Similar attempts have been unsuccessful in the past and were opposed in the UK by two strong lobbying organisations the Country Land and Business Association and the National Farmers Union. Germany, which had large collective farms still in operation in what was East Germany, also vigorously opposed changes marketed as &quot;reforms&quot;. The proposal was reportedly submitted for consultation with EU member states on 20 November 2007. In the finally adopted rules, the amount of support that any individual farm can receive will be limited to €300,000 per year. However, to take employment into account, the holding can deduct the costs of salaries in the previous year (including taxes &amp; social security contributions) before these reductions are applied. The funds &quot;saved&quot; will be transferred to the Rural Development envelope in the given country.
*Cross compliance: All payments will continue to be linked to the respect of a number of baseline requirements relating to environment, animal welfare and plant &amp; animal health standards. However, cross compliance will be greatly simplified.

<text>Ecclefechan (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Eaglais Fheichein&quot;) is a village located in Dumfries and Galloway in the south of Scotland.

The village is famous for being the birthplace of Thomas Carlyle.

Ecclefechan lies in the valley of the Mein Water, a tributary of the River Annan, south of Lockerbie, north of Annan and northwest of the English border. The A74(M) motorway runs immediately north of the village and Junction 19 is just northwest of the village.

The High Street of the village has a burn which runs through a culvert below it. This culvert was constructed in 1875 by Dr George Arnott at his own expense.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ecclefechan&quot; was recorded as &quot;Egilfeichane&quot; in 1507, and is of Brittonic origin. The first element is &quot;eglẹ:s&quot;, meaning &quot;a church&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;eglwys&quot;). The second element is the equivalent of Welsh fe&quot;chan&quot;, meaning &quot;little&quot;. Comparable Welsh toponyms include Eglwysfach and Llanfechan.

A lesser likelihood is that the name commemorates Féchín of Fore, a 7th-century Irish saint.

==Governance==
Ecclefechan is in the parliamentary constituency of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, David Mundell is the current Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP).

Ecclefechan is part of the South Scotland region in the Scottish Parliament, being in the constituency of Dumfriesshire. Oliver Mundell of the Conservatives is the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP).

Before Brexit for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for the Scotland constituency.

For local government purposes, it belongs to the Annandale East + Eskdale Ward of the Dumfries and Galloway Council Area. The village does not have its own parish council.

==Places of interest==
Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s birthplace &quot;The Arched House&quot; is a tourist attraction and has been maintained by the National Trust for Scotland since 1936. According to letters from Carlyle written to Charles Gavin Duffy in the summer of 1846, his mother&#x27;s farm in Ecclefechan was at that time located in Scotsbrig. From Scotsbrig, Carlyle watched the construction of the Caledonian Railway and complained to Duffy of Ecclefechan&#x27;s potato blight, and the abundance of railway navvies from Lancashire, Ireland, and Yorkshire, finding his visit home disturbed by the &quot;black potato-fields, and all roads and lanes overrun with drunken navvies&quot;. Carlyle commented &quot;I find that the Irish are best on point of behaviour&quot; because they sent their money home to their families and did not spend it on whiskey.

Ecclefechan lies at the foot of a large Caledonian hillfort, Burnswark, besieged by the Roman army in 140 AD. Its flat top dominates the horizon.

Hoddom Castle is located from the village centre.

Not far from the village is the Robgill Tower, built by the Clan Irvine. In the 1880s, an adjoining home was built. The tower was one of a number of structures built along the border as protection against incursions by the English.

==Notable residents==
* Archibald Arnott (1772–1855), Napoleon&#x27;s doctor on St Helena, was born in Ecclefechan on 18 April 1772 at Kirconnel Hall. He returned to Ecclefechan in his retirement and he was also buried in the Ecclefechan churchyard.
* Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881), the essayist, satirist, political philosopher and historian, was born at The Arched House, in Ecclefechan. He left Ecclefechan at the age of thirteen and walked the journey to Edinburgh in order to attend university. In 1828 Carlyle moved to Craigenputtock with his wife Jane. He never forgot his roots and insisted that Ecclefechan should become his final resting place. He was buried in Ecclefechan churchyard on 5 February 1881.
* William Harkness (1837–1903), an astronomer, was born at Ecclefechan.
* Janet Little (1759-1813), a poet who published &quot;The Poetical Works of Janet Little, The Scotch Milkmaid&quot; in 1791, was born at Nether Bogside in Ecclefechan parish. She was a contemporary of Robert Burns.
* James Bryson (J.B.) McLachlan (1869-1937), Scottish-Canadian trade unionist and communist politician, was born in Ecclefechan in 1869.

==Culture==
Robert Burns (1759–1796) composed a song entitled &quot;The Lass O&#x27; Ecclefechan&quot;.

Ecclefechan also has links to the Guinness family: the story of the Whistling Ploughboy of Ecclefechan under the title &quot;A Guinness With a Difference&quot; was written by Derick Bingham and published by TBF Thompson Ministries; it charts the ploughboy&#x27;s influence under God on the Guinness family.

&quot;Oor Wullie&quot; of &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; fame once got a day off school for spelling &quot;Ecclefechan&quot; correctly, and the Jocks and the Geordies of The Dandy once reminisced the &quot;Great Battle of Ecclefechan&quot;.

In A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle, Hugh MacDiarmid writes:

&quot;And as at sicna times am I,

I wad ha&#x27;e Scotland to my eye

Until I saw a timeless flame

Tak&#x27; Auchtermuchty for a name,

And kent that Ecclefechan stood

As pairt o&#x27; an eternal mood.&quot; (ll.1968-1973).

==Local produce==
Local produce includes:
* The Ecclefechan tart, which gained national prominence in late 2007 when the supermarket Sainsbury&#x27;s promoted it as an alternative to mince pies at Christmas, and the tarts sold over 50,000 packs in November 2007. The tart is a mixture of butter and dried fruits in a pastry shell. A version made by the Moray confectioner Walkers is now nationally available throughout the United Kingdom.
* The Fechan, a blended Scotch whisky, whose label denotes the Arched House.

<doc id="141928" wikidata="Q1017196" url="?curid=141928" title="Wigtown">
<text>Wigtown ( (both used locally); ) is a town and former royal burgh in Wigtownshire, of which it is the county town, within the Dumfries and Galloway region in Scotland. It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is known as &quot;Scotland&#x27;s National Book Town&quot; with a high concentration of second-hand book shops and an annual book festival.

Wigtown is part of the Machars peninsula.

==History==

===Name origins===
W.F.H. Nicolaisen offered two explanations for the place-name Wigtown. One theory was that it meant &#x27;dwelling place&#x27;, from the Old English &#x27;wic-ton&#x27;; however, if it is the same as Wigton in Cumbria, which was &#x27;Wiggeton&#x27; in 1162 and &#x27;Wigeton&#x27; in 1262, it may be &#x27;Wigca&#x27;s farm&#x27;. Other sources have suggested a Norse root with &#x27;Vik&#x27; meaning &#x27;bay&#x27;, giving the origin as a translation of &#x27;The town on the bay&#x27;.

===Neolithic Age===

The surrounding area (the Machars peninsula) is rich in prehistoric remains, most notably the Torhousekie Standing Stones, a Neolithic stone circle set on a raised platform of smaller stones. It consists of nineteen boulders up to 5 feet high aligned to the winter solstice, surrounding a ring cairn on which there are 3 large stones (flankers), two upright and one recumbent. On a low ridge across the road from the circle there are another three stones.

===Early history===

Andrew Symson, a 17th-century minister, suggested the first settlement would have stood on low-lying sands between the present-day Wigtown and Creetown. Wigtown had two ports (gates) which may have been closed at night to form a large cattle enclosure. These were East Port, opposite a site later occupied by the British Linen Bank, and the West Port, which stood opposite the mouth of the High Vennel.

Blackfriars, the Dominican friary, was founded at &quot;Friarland&quot; north of the mouth of the Bladnoch, south-east of the town of Wigtown, by Devorgilla in around 1267.

Wigtown Castle was in existence by 1291, on flat land down by the River Bladnoch, (outlines clearly seen on an aerial view), whilst the town and church were on a hill, &quot;an inversion of the usual arrangements&quot;. Nothing remains of the castle, although a strong natural site and indication of a large enclosed and defended area seems to point to a castle of the Edwardian type (Edward I) dating from the end of the 13th century. The site of the castle was excavated after a fashion about 1830, by a Captain Robert M’Kerlie and a team of volunteers. The outlines of a building were clearly traced on that occasion and a ditch, which had been broad, was distinctly seen on the north where there was also a semi-circular ridge of considerable elevation said to be the remains of the castle&#x27;s outer wall. A few years later, a reporter in the &quot;New Statistical Account&quot; wrote that a fosse was quite discernible, although &quot;the foundations of the walls cannot now be traced&quot;. Mortar and &quot;other remains indicative of an ancient building&quot; were still to be observed.

The town developed as port and became a royal burgh in 1292. Medieval Wigtown was built on a rectangular pattern with burgage plots around the present day Square (Main Street) and later, the West Port.

The royal burgh was granted to Sir Malcolm Fleming by David II in 1341. In 1372 Wigtown was purchased by Archibald the Grim Lord of Galloway. When he later became Earl of Douglas in 1384, it became attached to that earldom. It was restored to its former tenure as a royal burgh as a result of the forfeiture of the Douglases in 1455. Its status was formally recognised be a royal charter in 1457.

===Wigtown Martyrs===
Monuments to the Wigtown Martyrs exist in Wigtown. During &quot;The Killing Time&quot; of the Covenanters in the 17th century, Margaret McLachlan, an elderly woman in her 60s, and Margaret Willson, a teenager, were, for refusing to swear an oath declaring James VII of Scotland as head of the church, sentenced to be tied to stakes in the tidal channel of the River Bladnoch near its entrance to Wigtown Bay to be drowned by the incoming tide. The execution date was 11 May 1685. The ploy was that the younger woman might be persuaded to change her mind after watching the older woman drown. The strategy failed and both died. This execution was carried out by dragoons under the command of Major Windram in the presence of Sir Robert Grierson of Lag who held the King&#x27;s Commission to suppress the rebels in the South West. Their story, as told in various sources, tells how the women were betrayed by an informer. After about a month in prison they were tried as rebels and sentenced to death by drowning. The story of the Wigtown Martyrs was among those collected by Robert Wodrow and published in his &quot;History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution&quot;. The Church of Scotland synod had decided in 1708 to collect accounts of persecution under the Stuart monarchs, and persuaded Wodrow to take on the research. He wrote that Thomas Wilson &quot;lives now in his father&#x27;s room, and is ready to attest all I am writing.&quot;

===Later history===
In 1809, the Main Street Square gardens were enclosed by the town council as a public space, having formerly been used for keeping hens and other livestock. The enclosed area was planted and later, a bowling green and tennis courts would be added. Wigtown Bowling Club was established in 1830 and continues to run, being one of the oldest in Scotland. In the 19th century, a prison was established for the town on Harbour Road, being in operation until the 1940s when it closed (it is now a private residence). A gas works was established in the town in the mid 19th century in North Back Street and it remained in operation until the end of the Second World War.

An early reference to a tolbooth in Wigtown occurs in the late 16th century, and it is possible that this structure was blown up by gunpowder to make way for the new town hall which was completed in 1756. This municipal building in its turn gave way to the Wigtown County Buildings which were erected in 1862. The buildings served as the county Headquarters of Wigtownshire and are built of red sandstone from north-west England.

Wigtown removed its first mercat cross in the late 17th century (which stood at the east end of the Square). A second market cross was erected to replace the earlier one and instead built at the junction of Main street between 1816 and 1818.

Andrew Symson, a 17th-century minister of the church at Kirkinner, left a description of Wigtown. Writing in 1684, he described Wigtown as having &quot;a market for horses and young phillies...which the borderers come and buy in great numbers.&quot;

Residents of Wigtown and the surrounding area earned their livings in a variety of ways. An 18th-century observer, Samuel Robinson commented that from its peculiar position in relation to the sea, the county of Wigtown offered many singular advantages to the landing of smuggled goods and smugglers were not slow in taking advantage of this: however after a barracks was built &quot;the trade and those who conducted it were ruined&quot;.

Robinson, describing Wigtown, also noted that &quot;the greatest number of houses were of a homely character, thatched and one storey high&quot;.

The Newton Stewart to Whithorn branch railway line had a station at Wigtown which opened in 1877.

===Recent history===
Wigtown was described by William Learmonth in 1920 as the quaintest county town in Scotland.

RAF Wigtown was constructed on the outskirts of the town and opened in 1941. Under the control of 29 Group RAF, the Station was home to No. 1 Air Observers School, later No. 1 Advanced Flying Unit (Observer), as well as providing a short-term home to several operational RAF squadrons. The Station was closed in 1948. Today it is very occasionally used by light aircraft, sometimes being referred to as Baldoon Airfield.

In the 1990s Wigtown became Scotland&#x27;s &quot;book town&quot;. However, in contrast to Hay-on-Wye, Wigtown&#x27;s status as a book town was planned, in order to regenerate a very depressed town (the main employers, the creamery and distillery, having closed in the 1990s), although the distillery (Bladnoch) has now re-opened and is distilling its own malt whisky. There was a national search in Scotland for a candidate town. The Wigtown Book Festival was first held in 1999 and grew to be the second largest book festival in Scotland. There are currently around a dozen bookshops in the town.

==Education==
Wigtown Primary School is based in New Road in Wigtown. The primary school is housed in a building dating from 1850, that has since been altered and expanded. Before 1850, a grammar school provided education for all ages in the town in a building built in 1712.

==Churches==

Wigtown Parish Church was designed in the Gothic Revival style and completed in 1858.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church was designed in the Gothic Revival style and completed in 1879 to a design by the Edinburgh architect John George Garden Brown. 

Wigtown Quaker Meeting House is as at Chapel Court, South Main Street.

Wigtown Baptist Church is in Southfield Lane.

A Seceder&#x27;s Meeting house and U.F. Church, later known as Wigtown West Church of Scotland was built in 1750 to the west of the town but demolished in the late 20th century.

==Landmarks and Culture==
Wigtown lies less than from Bladnoch, a village with a distillery producing malt whisky of the same name. The River Bladnoch can be fished for Atlantic salmon and has historically been well known as one of Scotland&#x27;s finest rivers producing spring fish. It meets the River Cree in Wigtown Bay, meandering through a large area of salt marsh which has been designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). Wigtown Bay is the largest LNR in Britain, and is home to a wealth of wildlife, particularly birds. Some people come to admire them from the comfort of the viewing hides situated near the harbour, others, wildfowlers, come to harvest some of the plentiful ducks and geese attracted by the extensive conservation work carried out by the Wigtown Wildfowling Club. The first pair of ospreys to return to Galloway in over 100 years arrived in 2004. A live camera link to their nest was created and can be viewed in the Wigtown County Buildings.

To the east of Wigtown is The Martyrs&#x27; Stake, a monument marking the traditional site where the Wigtown Martyrs were drowned in the 17th century. Their graves are in the Parish Church cemetery. There is a small cell in the County Buildings in which they were imprisoned prior to their execution. This cell is all that remains of a much older building which was largely destroyed to make way for the County Buildings (built in 1862).

===Events===
The Wigtown Book Festival is a ten-day literary festival held annually in Wigtown. The first event took place in 1999.

The Wigtown Agricultural Show is an annual event held in August, having been held since 1811.

===Bookshops===

In 2018, Wigtown had 13 retail bookshops, one of which was mail-order. The town has its own bookseller&#x27;s association. The bookshops mean that Wigtown is estimated to have several hundred thousand books in the town.

The &quot;Old Bank bookshop&quot; is located in a former bank and customs house. As the Customs House fell out of use with the decline of the port, it was bought and expanded as a branch of the City of Glasgow Bank, later the National Bank.

The &quot;Bookshop&quot; in Wigtown is Scotland&#x27;s largest second-hand bookshop. It is reported to have a mile of shelving and some 100,000 books. The owner, Shaun Bythell, has written a book about his experiences selling books in the town.

The &quot;Open Book&quot; is a bookshop that is operated by customers who can take temporary charge of the shop and live in the accommodation above.

==In popular culture==
Jessica A. Fox&#x27;s &quot;Three Things You Need to Know About Rockets&quot; (2013) is her account of following her dream and moving from Los Angeles and a job at NASA to help run a bookshop in Wigtown and finding love.

Shaun Bythell&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of a Bookseller,&quot; published 2017, &quot;Confessions of a Bookseller&quot; (2019) and &quot;Remainders of the Day&quot; (2022) detail his experiences as the owner of The Bookshop, Scotland&#x27;s largest second-hand bookshop.

Kathleen Hart&#x27;s &quot;Devorgilla Days&quot;, published in 2021 is a memoir of life in Scotland&#x27;s book town, it is a celebration of the community who helped heal her, including the thousands of followers on Instagram where she is known as Poshpedlar.

The BBC reported on 2 October 2018 that options on Fox&#x27;s book and Bythell&#x27;s first book had been bought by &quot;a Hollywood film company&quot; with the idea of combining them to create a movie.

In the Harry Potter universe, the Wigtown Wanderers quidditch team come from the town.

Heather Cox and Jessica Morgan&#x27;s 2020 book, &quot;The Heir Affair&quot;, had significant scenes set in and around Wigtown. The main characters stay in an AirBnb above a book shop that they&#x27;re also able to run.

<doc id="141931" wikidata="Q81796" url="?curid=141931" title="J. M. Barrie">
<text>Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, (; 9 May 1860 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote several successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (first included in Barrie&#x27;s 1902 adult novel &quot;The Little White Bird&quot;), then to write &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;, a 1904 West End &quot;fairy play&quot; about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.

Although he continued to write successfully, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; overshadowed his other work, and is credited with popularising the name Wendy. Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents. Barrie was made a baronet by George V on 14 June 1913, and a member of the Order of Merit in the 1922 New Year Honours. Before his death, he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, which continues to benefit from them.

==Childhood and adolescence==
James Matthew Barrie was born in Kirriemuir, Angus, to a conservative Calvinist family. His father, David Barrie, was a modestly successful weaver. His mother, Margaret Ogilvy, assumed her deceased mother&#x27;s household responsibilities at the age of eight. Barrie was the ninth child of ten (two of whom died before he was born), all of whom were schooled in at least the three Rs in preparation for possible professional careers. He was a small child and drew attention to himself with storytelling. He grew to only 5 ft 3 in. (161 cm) according to his 1934 passport.

When James Barrie was six years old, his elder brother David (their mother&#x27;s favourite) died in an ice-skating accident on the day before his 14th birthday. This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David&#x27;s place in his mother&#x27;s attentions, even wearing David&#x27;s clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard her say, &quot;Is that you?&quot; &quot;I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to&quot;, wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother &quot;Margaret Ogilvy&quot; (1896) &quot;and I said in a little lonely voice, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s no&#x27; him, it&#x27;s just me. Barrie&#x27;s mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

At the age of eight, Barrie was sent to the Glasgow Academy in the care of his eldest siblings, Alexander and Mary Ann, who taught at the school. When he was 10, he returned home and continued his education at the Forfar Academy. At 14, he left home for Dumfries Academy, again under the watch of Alexander and Mary Ann. He became a voracious reader and was fond of penny dreadfuls and the works of Robert Michael Ballantyne and James Fenimore Cooper. At Dumfries, he and his friends spent time in the garden of Moat Brae house, playing pirates &quot;in a sort of Odyssey that was long afterwards to become the play of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. They formed a drama club, producing his first play &quot;Bandelero the Bandit&quot;, which provoked a minor controversy following a scathing moral denunciation from a clergyman on the school&#x27;s governing board.

==Literary career==

Barrie knew that he wished to follow a career as an author. However, his family attempted to persuade him to choose a profession such as the ministry. With advice from Alexander, he was able to work out a compromise: he would attend a university but would study literature. Barrie enrolled at the University of Edinburgh where he wrote drama reviews for the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Courant&quot;. He graduated and obtained an M.A. on 21 April 1882.

Following a job advertisement found by his sister in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, he worked for a year and a half as a staff journalist on the &quot;Nottingham Journal&quot;. Back in Kirriemuir, he submitted a piece to the &quot;St. James&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, a London newspaper, using his mother&#x27;s stories about the town where she grew up (renamed &quot;Thrums&quot;). The editor &quot;liked that Scotch thing&quot; so well that Barrie ended up writing a series of these stories. They served as the basis for his first novels: &quot;Auld Licht Idylls&quot; (1888), &quot;A Window in Thrums&quot; (1889), and &quot;The Little Minister&quot; (1891).
The stories depicted the &quot;Auld Lichts&quot;, a strict religious sect to which his grandfather had once belonged. Modern literary criticism of these early works has been unfavourable, tending to disparage them as sentimental and nostalgic depictions of a parochial Scotland, far from the realities of the industrialised 19th century, seen as characteristic of what became known as the Kailyard School. Despite, or perhaps because of, this, they were popular enough at the time to establish Barrie as a successful writer. Following that success, he published &quot;Better Dead&quot; (1888) privately and at his own expense, but it failed to sell. His two &quot;Tommy&quot; novels, &quot;Sentimental Tommy&quot; (1896) and &quot;Tommy and Grizel&quot; (1900), were about a boy and young man who clings to childish fantasy, with an unhappy ending. The English novelist George Gissing read the former in November 1896 and wrote that he &quot;thoroughly dislike[d it]&quot;.

Meanwhile, Barrie&#x27;s attention turned increasingly to works for the theatre, beginning with a biography of Richard Savage, written by Barrie and H. B. Marriott Watson; it was performed only once and critically panned. He immediately followed this with &quot;Ibsen&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, or &quot;Toole Up-to-Date&quot; (1891), a parody of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s dramas &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot;. &quot;Ghosts&quot; had been unlicensed in the UK until 1914, but had created a sensation at the time from a single &quot;club&quot; performance.

The production of &quot;Ibsen&#x27;s Ghost&quot; at Toole&#x27;s Theatre in London was seen by William Archer, the translator of Ibsen&#x27;s works into English. Apparently comfortable with the parody, he enjoyed the humour of the play and recommended it to others. Barrie&#x27;s third play &quot;Walker, London&quot; (1892) resulted in his being introduced to a young actress named Mary Ansell. He proposed to her and they were married on 9 July 1894. Barrie bought her a Saint Bernard puppy, Porthos, who played a part in the 1902 novel &quot;The Little White Bird&quot;. He used Ansell&#x27;s first name for many characters in his novels. Barrie also authored &quot;Jane Annie&quot;, a comic opera for Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte (1893), which failed; he persuaded Arthur Conan Doyle to revise and finish it for him.

In 1901 and 1902, he had back-to-back successes; &quot;Quality Street&quot; was about a respectable, responsible old maid who poses as her own flirtatious niece to try to win the attention of a former suitor returned from the war. &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; was a critically acclaimed social commentary with elaborate staging, about an aristocratic family and their household servants whose social order is inverted after they are shipwrecked on a desert island. Max Beerbohm thought it &quot;quite the best thing that has happened, in my time, to the British theatre&quot;.

The character of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Little White Bird&quot;. The novel was published in the UK by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1902, and serialised in the US in the same year in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Barrie&#x27;s more famous and enduring work &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; had its first stage performance on 27 December 1904 at the West End’s Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre. This play introduced audiences to the name &quot;Wendy&quot;; it was inspired by a young girl named Margaret Henley who called Barrie &quot;Friendy&quot;, but could not pronounce her &quot;R&quot;s very well. The Bloomsbury scenes show the societal constraints of late Victorian and Edwardian middle class domestic reality, contrasted with Neverland, a world where morality is ambivalent. George Bernard Shaw described the play as &quot;ostensibly a holiday entertainment for children but really a play for grown-up people&quot;, suggesting deeper social metaphors at work in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. In 1907, it was parodied by H. G. Pélissier and &quot;The Follies&quot; at the Apollo Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue in a sketch entitled &quot;Baffles or the Peterpan-tomime.&quot; This parody was in fact reviewed by Barrie himself in a magazine called &quot;Sphere&quot; as being &quot;funny in little bits&quot;, although he also concluded that &quot;The Follies&quot; were &quot;one of the funniest things now to be seen in London.&quot;

Barrie had a long string of successes on the stage after &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, many of which discuss social concerns, as Barrie continued to integrate his work and his beliefs. &quot;The Twelve Pound Look&quot; (1910) concerns a wife leaving her &#x27;typical&#x27; husband once she can gain an independent income. Other plays, such as &quot;Mary Rose&quot; (1920) and &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; (1917), revisit the idea of the ageless child and parallel worlds. Barrie was involved in the 1909 and 1911 attempts to challenge the censorship of the theatre by the Lord Chamberlain, along with a number of other playwrights.

In 1911, Barrie developed the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; play into the novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;. In April 1929, Barrie gave the copyright of the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital, a leading children&#x27;s hospital in London. The current status of the copyright is somewhat complex. His final play was &quot;The Boy David&quot; (1936), which dramatised the Biblical story of King Saul and the young David. Like the role of Peter Pan, that of David was played by a woman, Elisabeth Bergner, for whom Barrie wrote the play.

== Social connections ==
Barrie moved in literary circles and had many famous friends in addition to his professional collaborators. Novelist George Meredith was an early social patron. He had a long correspondence with fellow Scot Robert Louis Stevenson, who lived in Samoa at the time. Stevenson invited Barrie to visit him, but the two never met. He was also friends with fellow Scots writer S. R. Crockett. George Bernard Shaw was his neighbour in London for several years, and once participated in a Western that Barrie scripted and filmed. H. G. Wells was a friend of many years, and tried to intervene when Barrie&#x27;s marriage fell apart. Barrie met Thomas Hardy through Hugh Clifford while he was staying in London. He was friends with Nobel prize winner John Galsworthy.

Barrie remained tied to his Scottish roots and visited his hometown of Kirriemuir regularly with his wards. When choosing his first personal secretary, Barrie chose E. V. Lucas&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Lucas, who had Scottish roots through her American parentage. After Elizabeth Lucas moved to Paris, France, Barrie chose Cynthia Asquith as his personal secretary. 

After the First World War, Barrie sometimes stayed at Stanway House near the village of Stanway in Gloucestershire. He paid for the pavilion at Stanway cricket ground. In 1887, he founded an amateur cricket team for friends of similarly limited playing ability, and named it the Allahakbarries under the mistaken belief that &quot;Allah akbar&quot; meant &quot;Heaven help us&quot; in Arabic (rather than &quot;God is great&quot;). Some of the best known British authors from the era played on the team at various times, including H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Conan Doyle, P. G. Wodehouse, Jerome K. Jerome, G. K. Chesterton, A. A. Milne, E. W. Hornung, A. E. W. Mason, Walter Raleigh, E. V. Lucas, Maurice Hewlett, Owen Seaman (editor of &quot;Punch&quot;), Bernard Partridge, George Cecil Ives, George Llewelyn Davies (see below) and the son of Alfred Tennyson. In 1891, Barrie joined the newly formed Authors Cricket Club and also played for its cricket team, the Authors XI, alongside Doyle, Wodehouse and Milne. The Allahakbarries and the Authors XI continued to exist side by side until 1912.

Barrie befriended Africa explorer Joseph Thomson and Antarctica explorer Robert Falcon Scott. He was godfather to Scott&#x27;s son Peter, and was one of the seven people to whom Scott wrote letters in the final hours of his life during his expedition to the South Pole, asking Barrie to take care of his wife Kathleen and son Peter. Barrie was so proud of the letter that he carried it around for the rest of his life.

In 1896, his agent Addison Bright persuaded him to meet with Broadway producer Charles Frohman, who became his financial backer and a close friend, as well. Frohman was responsible for producing the debut of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in both England and the US, as well as other productions of Barrie&#x27;s plays. He famously declined a lifeboat seat when the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. Actress Rita Jolivet stood with Frohman, George Vernon and Captain Alick Scott at the end of Lusitania&#x27;s sinking, but she survived the sinking and recalled Frohman paraphrasing &quot;Peter Pan&quot;: &#x27;Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure that life gives us.&#x27; Barrie had himself sailed on one of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;&#x27;s final Atlantic crossings in September 1914, during which rumours circulated amongst the passengers that the liner was to be transferred to the British Admiralty for troopship duties on arrival in New York.

His secretary from 1917, Cynthia Asquith, was the daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith, British Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916. In the 1930s, Barrie met and told stories to the young daughters of the Duke of York, the future Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret. After meeting him, the three-year-old Princess Margaret announced, &quot;He is my greatest friend and I am his greatest friend&quot;.

==Marriage==

Barrie became acquainted with actress Mary Ansell in 1891, when he asked his friend Jerome K. Jerome for a pretty actress to play a role in his play &quot;Walker, London&quot;. The two became friends, and she helped his family to care for him when he fell very ill in 1893 and 1894. They married in Kirriemuir on 9 July 1894, shortly after Barrie recovered, and Mary retired from the stage. The wedding was a small ceremony in his parents&#x27; home, in the Scottish tradition. The relationship was reportedly unconsummated, and the couple had no children.

In 1895, the Barries bought a house on Gloucester Road, in South Kensington. Barrie would take long walks in nearby Kensington Gardens, and in 1900 the couple moved into a house directly overlooking the gardens at 100 Bayswater Road. Mary had a flair for interior design and set about transforming the ground floor, creating two large reception rooms with painted panelling and adding fashionable features, such as a conservatory. In the same year, Mary found Black Lake Cottage at Farnham in Surrey, which became the couple&#x27;s &quot;bolt hole&quot; where Barrie could entertain his cricketing friends and the Llewelyn Davies family.

Beginning in mid-1908, Mary had an affair with Gilbert Cannan (who was twenty years younger than she and an associate of Barrie in his anti-censorship activities), including a visit together to Black Lake Cottage, known only to the house staff. When Barrie learned of the affair in July 1909, he demanded that she end it, but she refused. To avoid the scandal of divorce, he offered a legal separation if she would agree not to see Cannan any more, but she still refused. Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity; the divorce was granted in October 1909. Knowing how painful the divorce was for him, some of Barrie&#x27;s friends wrote to a number of newspaper editors asking them not to publish the story. In the event, only three newspapers did. Barrie continued to support Mary financially even after she married Cannan, by giving her an annual allowance, which was handed over at a private dinner held on her and Barrie&#x27;s wedding anniversary.

==Llewelyn Davies family==

The Llewelyn Davies family played an important part in Barrie&#x27;s literary and personal life, consisting of Arthur (1863–1907), Sylvia (1866–1910) (daughter of George du Maurier), and their five sons: George (1893–1915), John (Jack) (1894–1959), Peter (1897–1960), Michael (1900–1921) and Nicholas (Nico) (1903–1980).

Barrie became acquainted with the family in 1897, meeting George and Jack (and baby Peter) with their nurse (nanny) Mary Hodgson in London&#x27;s Kensington Gardens. He lived nearby and often walked his Saint Bernard dog Porthos in the park. He entertained the boys regularly with his ability to wiggle his ears and eyebrows, and with his stories. He did not meet Sylvia until a chance encounter at a dinner party in December. She told Barrie that Peter had been named after the title character in her father&#x27;s novel, &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot;.
Barrie became a regular visitor at the Davies household and a common companion to Sylvia and her boys, despite the fact that both he and she were married to other people. In 1901, he invited the Davies family to Black Lake Cottage, where he produced an album of captioned photographs of the boys acting out a pirate adventure, entitled &quot;The Boy Castaways of Black Lake Island&quot;. Barrie had two copies made, one of which he gave to Arthur, who misplaced it on a train. The only surviving copy is held at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.

The character of Peter Pan was invented to entertain George and Jack. Barrie would say, to amuse them, that their little brother Peter could fly. He claimed that babies were birds before they were born; parents put bars on nursery windows to keep the little ones from flying away. This grew into a tale of a baby boy who did fly away.
Arthur Llewelyn Davies died in 1907, and &quot;Uncle Jim&quot; became even more involved with the Davies family, providing financial support to them. (His income from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and other works was easily adequate to provide for their living expenses and education.) Following Sylvia&#x27;s death in 1910, Barrie claimed that they had recently been engaged to be married. Her will indicated nothing to that effect but specified her wish for &quot;J. M. B.&quot; to be trustee and guardian to the boys, along with her mother Emma, her brother Guy du Maurier and Arthur&#x27;s brother Compton. It expressed her confidence in Barrie as the boys&#x27; caretaker and her wish for &quot;the boys to treat him (&amp; their uncles) with absolute confidence &amp; straightforwardness &amp; to talk to him about everything.&quot; When copying the will informally for Sylvia&#x27;s family a few months later, Barrie inserted himself elsewhere: Sylvia had written that she would like Mary Hodgson, the boys&#x27; nurse, to continue taking care of them, and for &quot;Jenny&quot; (referring to Hodgson&#x27;s sister) to come and help her; Barrie instead wrote, &quot;Jimmy&quot; (Sylvia&#x27;s nickname for him). Barrie and Hodgson did not get along well but served together as surrogate parents until the boys were grown.

Barrie also had friendships with other children, both before he met the Davies boys and after they had grown up, and there has since been unsubstantiated speculation that Barrie was a paedophile. One source for the speculation is a scene in the novel &quot;The Little White Bird&quot;, in which the protagonist helps a small boy undress for bed, and at the boy&#x27;s request they sleep in the same bed. However, there is no evidence that Barrie had sexual contact with children, nor that he was suspected of it at the time. Nico, the youngest of the brothers, denied as an adult that Barrie ever behaved inappropriately. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that Uncle Jim ever experienced what one might call &#x27;a stirring in the undergrowth&#x27; for anyone—man, woman, or child&quot;, he stated. &quot;He was an innocent—which is why he could write Peter Pan.&quot; His relationships with the surviving Davies boys continued well beyond their childhood and adolescence.

The Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens, erected secretly overnight for May Morning in 1912, was supposed to be modelled upon old photographs of Michael dressed as the character. However, the sculptor, Sir George Frampton, used a different child as a model, leaving Barrie disappointed with the result. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t show the devil in Peter&quot;, he said.

Barrie suffered bereavements with the boys, losing the two to whom he was closest in their early twenties. George was killed in action in 1915, in the First World War. Michael, with whom Barrie corresponded daily while at boarding school and university, drowned in 1921, with his friend, Rupert Buxton, at a known danger spot at Sandford Lock near Oxford, one month short of his 21st birthday. Some years after Barrie&#x27;s death, Peter compiled his &quot;Morgue&quot; from family letters and papers, interpolated with his own informed comments on his family and their relationship with Barrie. Peter died in 1960 by throwing himself in front of an Underground train at Sloane Square station.

==Death==

Barrie died of pneumonia at a nursing home in Manchester Street, Marylebone on 19 June 1937. He was buried at Kirriemuir next to his parents and two of his siblings. His birthplace at 9 Brechin Road is maintained as a museum by the National Trust for Scotland.

Barrie left the bulk of his estate to his secretary Lady Cynthia Asquith, but excluding the rights to all Peter Pan works (which included &quot;The Little White Bird&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot;, the play &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up&quot; and the novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;), whose copyright he had previously given to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. The surviving Llewelyn Davies boys received legacies, and he made provisions for his former wife Mary Ansell to receive an annuity during her lifetime.

His will also left £500 to the Bower Free Church in Caithness to mark the memory of Rev James Winter who was to have married Barrie&#x27;s sister in June 1892 but was killed in a fall from his horse in May 1892. Barrie had several connections to the Free Church of Scotland, including his maternal uncle Rev David Ogilvy (1822–1904), who was minister of Dalziel Church in Motherwell. James and his brother William Winter (also a Free Church minister) were both born in Cortachy the sons of Rev William Winter. Cortachy is just west of Kirriemuir and the Winters seem closely connected to the Ogilvy family.

==Honours==
=== Personal ===
Barrie was created a baronet by King George V in 1913. He was made a member of the Order of Merit in 1922.

In 1919, he was elected Rector of the University of St Andrews for a three-year term. In 1922, he delivered his celebrated Rectorial Address on Courage at St Andrews, and visited University College Dundee with Earl Haig to open its new playing fields, with Barrie bowling a few balls to Haig. He served as Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh from 1930 to 1937.

Barrie was the only person to receive the Freedom of Kirriemuir in a ceremony on 7 June 1930 in Kirriemuir Town Hall where he was presented with a silver casket containing the freedom scroll. The casket was made by silversmiths Brook &amp; Son in Edinburgh in 1929 and is decorated with images of sites in Kirriemuir which held significant memories for Barrie: Kirriemuir Townhouse, Strathview, Window in Thrums, the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens and the Barrie Cricket Pavilion. The casket is on display in the Kirrimuir Gateway to the Glens Museum in the Kirriemuir Town House.

<text>The handkerchief code (also known as the hanky/hankie code, the bandana/bandanna code, and flagging) is a system of color-coded cloth handkerchief or bandanas for non-verbally communicating one&#x27;s interests in sexual activities and fetishes. The color of the handkerchief identifies a particular activity, and the pocket it is worn in (left or right) identifies the wearer&#x27;s preferred role in that activity. Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a &quot;top&quot; (considered &quot;active&quot; in the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief) while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a &quot;bottom&quot; (considered &quot;passive&quot; in it). For example, a dark blue handkerchief indicates an interest in anal sex, and wearing it in the left pocket indicates a preference for being the penetrating partner. The code was first used in the 1970s in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe, by gay and bisexual men seeking casual sex or BDSM practitioners. Over time the colors and types of apparel in use have greatly proliferated.

==Origin==
The wearing of colored bandanas around the neck as a practical accessory was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among cowboys, steam railroad engineers, and miners in the Western United States. It is thought that the wearing of bandanas by gay men originated in San Francisco after the Gold Rush, when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in square dances developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one&#x27;s jeans).

In the 1970s, the modern hanky code developed as a semiotic system of sexual advertising popular among the gay leather community of the United States and cruising scene more broadly. Businesses across the country used the hanky code in advertisements to gay clientele.

The origin of the modern hanky code is disputed. The modern hanky code is often reported to have started in New York City around 1970, when a journalist for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; jested that instead of simply wearing a set of keys on one side or the other (then a common code to indicate whether someone was a &quot;top&quot; or a &quot;bottom&quot;), it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored handkerchiefs. However, other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today&#x27;s code to marketing efforts around 1971 by The Trading Post, a San Francisco department store for erotic merchandise, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors. Meanwhile, Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather &#x27;n&#x27; Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.

Around 1980, &quot;Bob Damron&#x27;s Address Book&quot; published a yearly chart for the meaning of each colored handkerchief.
==Examples==

There is no single authoritative standard for the code, but there is broad agreement on the definition of certain colors. This table is drawn from Larry Townsend&#x27;s &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Handbook II&quot; (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. Townsend noted that discussion with a prospective partner is still important because people may wear a given color &quot;only because the idea of the hankie turns them on&quot; or &quot;may not even know what it means&quot;.

Longer, more elaborate lists may be found online, but many of the color variations in them are less often used in practice.

== Present day ==
The hanky code has recently undergone a revival and while the use of handkerchiefs may not be as prevalent, the hanky colors are a common consideration in the choice of leather and fetish gear color.

According to the Schwules Museum, the creation of the leather pride flag in 1989 marked &quot;a turning point in the history of the mostly gay leather and BDSM movements: moving away from secret signs and symbols (hanky cloths, for example) to more obvious and public visibility, both in the gay scene and society in general.&quot;

Social media may have lessened the use of hankies in cruising areas by digitizing the process. By using online platforms, men who have sex with men (MSM) can eliminate harassment and violence that they may face in public. Social networking services for MSM allow them to easily identify sexual interests without the need for physical apparel.

== In popular culture ==
* In the film &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980), Detective Steve Burns (Al Pacino) goes into a store and has the handkerchief code explained to him by a hanky salesman (Powers Boothe).
* In the pornographic fisting film &quot;Erotic Hands&quot; (1980) by Bijou Video, a red handkerchief fills the screen for the opening credits.
* In the early 1980s, Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford made the handkerchief code part of his stage costume. In the music video for &quot;Heading Out to the Highway&quot;, Halford can be seen wearing a red handkerchief in his left pocket.
* The hanky code is depicted and explained in the music video for &quot;House of Air&quot; (2017) by Brendan Maclean.

<text>Sanquhar (, ) is a town on the River Nith in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, north of Thornhill and west of Moffat. It is a former Royal Burgh.

It is notable for its tiny post office, established in 1712 and considered the oldest working post office in the world. It was also where the Covenanters, who opposed episcopalisation of the church, signed the &quot;Sanquhar Declaration&quot; renouncing their allegiance to the King, an event commemorated by a monument in the main street.

The church of St Brides contains a memorial to James Crichton, a 16th-century polymath. The ruins of Sanquhar Castle stand nearby. Nithsdale Wanderers, the local football team, were formed in 1897. In 1924–25, they won the Scottish Division Three.

The town celebrates the granting of its Royal Charter on the 3rd Saturday in August each year. The day consists of a procession of horses, decorated floats and massed pipes and drums around the town.

The towns colours are blue and white.

==History==
The name &quot;Sanquhar&quot; comes from the Scottish Gaelic language &quot;An t-Seanchair&quot;, meaning &quot;old fort&quot;. A 15th-century castle ruin overlooks the town, but the name predates even this ancient fort. The antiquary, William Forbes Skene even considered it the probable location of the settlement named Corda in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;.

The ancient hill fort at Tynron Doon is located about 28 kilometres away from the town. This fort is described in &quot;Archaeology of late Celtic Britain and Ireland&quot; by L R Laing (1975) as &quot;a well-preserved multivallate hillfort&quot; which probably began its existence in the Iron Age and continued to be used throughout the Dark Ages and into the early Medieval period. During Roman times the fort would have been in Selgovae territory; after the Romans departed it lay on the borders of the Strathclyde Britons and the Galwyddel. This place is associated with a local legend of a &quot;heidless horseman&quot; who is supposed to have ridden down from it as an omen of death, a story which possibly has some origin in a Celtic head cult. The &quot;Poetical Works&quot; of Sir Walter Scott (1822) attest that Robert the Bruce hid in the forests about this hill after he had killed one of his rivals, John &quot;the Red&quot; Comyn.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, waves of Gaelic settlers came to the area from Ireland. These Scoto-Irish people replaced the native Britons and became the dominant inhabitants for hundreds of years. In the 12th century, Norman colonization of the British Islands brought a feudal system of government and squabbling barons and sheriffs ruled the land for several centuries. These border counties were constantly in a state of turmoil as groups raided each other across the dividing lines.

During the war of Scottish Independence the English army took over the old castle at Sanquhar. The Lord of the Castle, Sir William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas, learned of this and came up with a clever plot where one man sneaked into the castle and threw open the gates, allowing Lord Douglas to seize it. The English began a counter-attack, but William Wallace learned of the battle and came to the rescue. As the English army retreated, Wallace chased them down and killed 500 of them. Wallace visited the castle on several occasions.

===Crichton family===
During the reign of Robert the Bruce the Crichton family obtained the lands round about Sanquhar and ruled over the area from the mid-14th until the mid-17th centuries. Mary, Queen of Scots, (cousin of Queen Elizabeth the 1st) came to Sanquhar in May 1568 after her defeat at the battle of Langside. Lord Crichton of Sanquhar was loyal to Mary, and harboured her until she escaped across the River Nith.

The end of the Crichton family power in the area was the result of a lavish party. In July 1617, the King of Great Britain, James VI and I, travelled through Scotland to Glasgow, and on his way home stopped at the castle in Sanquhar. The Crichtons welcomed him with a display so huge that it bankrupted them. It is said that Lord Crichton escorted the king to bed carrying a lighted torch made from £30,000 in bond notes that the king owed Lord Crichton. By 1639, the Crichtons had moved to Ayrshire, and sold their holdings in Sanquhar to the Earl of Queensberry.

A joke in the region is that many a young woman who worked for the Crichtons would &quot;Go in the servants&#x27; entrance and come out the family way&quot;. However, one well-regarded member of Crichton family was James Crichton (known as &#x27;The Admirable Crichton&#x27;).

===Religious upheaval===

Sanquhar was a hotbed of unrest during the Covenanting period. With its position as the only major town in a large area, and situated by the River Nith, it seemed that whenever any remarkable political movement was going on people would go to Sanquhar to proclaim their testimonies on the subject. It was here, in 1680, that Richard Cameron, with a band of armed supporters, posted on the town cross the first declaration of Sanquhar renouncing allegiance to Charles II.

The year 1685 saw the second declaration, by James Renwick, who also took a large armed party into Sanquhar, frightening all the townspeople who thought a battle was coming. The &quot;Sanquhar Declarations&quot;, as they are known, set forth the basis of religious freedom in Scotland.

In the Victorian period the town&#x27;s mercat cross was transformed into a monument bearing the inscription: In commemoration of the two famous Sanquhar Declarations, which were published on this spot, where stood the ancient Cross of the Burgh; the one by the Rev. Richard Cameron, on 22 June 1680; the other by the Rev. James Renwick, on 25 May 1685, during the Killing Time.

The end of the Covenanting period in the early 18th century was not the last religious upheaval for the area. The Church of Scotland was torn by several disputes over the years. One of the major issues was whether the local populations or church headquarters could hire local ministers. In the 1830s many churches seceded and in 1843 a large number of churches broke away to form the Free Church of Scotland. The time was known as the “Great Disruption”. In Sanquhar the minister joined the splinter group in 1843.

===Later history===
In the 1780s, the legendary Scottish poet Robert Burns was a frequent visitor to Sanquhar. When he was renovating a farm in 1788, he often passed through on the way back to his wife, Jean, in Ayrshire. Afterwards, he became a well-known face because of his excise duties. Burns called the town &quot;Black Joan&quot; in his ballad &quot;Five Carlins&quot; in which he represented the local burghs as characters. He would stay overnight at the Queensberry Arms in the High Street, making friends with the owner, bailie Edward Whigham and calling it &quot;the only tolerable Inn in the place&quot;.
Sanquhar is notable for its tiny post office and held to be the oldest working post office in the world. Established in 1712, its closest rival is a post office in Stockholm, Sweden which opened in 1720. In 2019 it was put up for sale and was finally bought by new owners, the 17th in its operating history, in 2023.

The wool trade had been an important one in the coastal trading towns of Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbright since medieval times and by the 18th century Sanquhar had developed as an inland market centre. The Sanquhar Wool Fair, held in July, regulated the prices for the whole south of Scotland. A distinctive two-coloured pattern of knitting which is widely known as &#x27;Sanquhar knitting&#x27; takes its name from this small parish. A traveller&#x27;s account early in the 18th century tells us: &#x27;Gloves they make better and cheaper than in England, for they send great quantities thither.&#x27; Many a poor farm family supported themselves with extra income from these sought-after knitted garments. While knitting died out as an industry, the presentation of traditional Sanquhar gloves is an important part of local celebrations even today. Sanquhar resident, May MacCormick, has written down numerous glove designs many of which had not been previously recorded. Incorporating the owner&#x27;s initials into the cuff to personalise the gloves is part of the tradition.

The decline of traditional industries hurt the town, but now new manufacturers are moving in and there is a strong sense of community in the burgh. William Adam, a famous Scottish architect, designed Sanquhar Tolbooth in the centre of town, which is the only surviving building of this type designed by him. Completed in 1739, much of the building materials for it were taken from the old castle in Sanquhar and it is currently used as the town museum, containing local artifacts and memorabilia.

The town has the world&#x27;s oldest curling society, formed in 1774 with sixty members. James Brown, who wrote an important history of the town, is also credited with writing the rules universally used for the sport.

The railway line has remained open for freight and passenger traffic, however Sanquhar railway station was closed and only re-opened in recent years.

===Crawick Village===
Other work came in the form of a carpet factory, along the Crawick Water. At first, it consisted of a few separate looms, but by the 1830s, there was a large factory, boasting 54 looms at its height. The carpets made here were world-renowned for their durability and orders came from as far away as South America. A large proportion of their total production was shipped to Valparaíso, Chile.

The location along the Crawick River was also the home of John Rigg&#x27;s forge. In the late 18th century, he had been persuaded to move here from Dalston in Cumbria to supply tools for the coalfields. He made a damhead opposite the village of Crawick and used the water to power his factory. The water separated the parishes of Sanquhar and Kirkconnel, and although the forge was on the Kirkconnel side, Sanquhar always laid claim to it. The forge produced shovels and other tools into the 20th century.

The village of Crawick had once been known as a haven for witches. One story is that the parish minister&#x27;s cows began making milk that would not churn. He sent one of his servants to tie a branch from a rowan tree over the doorway of the witch&#x27;s house in Crawick, which ended the curse. For a long time, a large rowan tree flourished in the front yard of the church, perhaps partly to keep these evil spirits away. Life in Crawick was described beautifully by James Brown, in his &quot;History of Sanquhar&quot;:

“Crawick Mill was a clean tidy little hamlet pleasantly embosomed on the banks of the Crawick and sheltered from almost every wind that blew, and there was no happier colony of weavers to be found in any country district in Scotland. They were almost all natives, whose whole life associations were connected with the place. We have no pleasanter memory than that of the weavers playing quoits, of which they were very fond, on the summer evenings on the &quot;Alley&quot;, a long strip of ground on the banks of the stream behind the Village, while their wives, with their clean &quot;mutches&quot; sat about or sauntered up and down chatting and gossiping, and the bairns were either scrambling along the wooded banks of the Crawick or &quot;paidling&quot; in its clear water, the pleasant babble of the stream as it rushed over the dam-head mingling with the voices of the men at their game and the joyous shouts and laughter of the children.”

== Cycling history ==

In the late 1930s, Sanquhar was the home to Crawick Wheelers, a very successful Cycling Club which was instrumental in the setting of a number of Scottish Time Trial records. The Scott brothers were prolific in setting these records along with Jock Tudhope. The Scotts were predominantly miners in the local collieries and worked an 11-day fortnight finishing work on a Saturday morning. They would then ride from Sanquhar to Dundee or Perth and take part in Time Trial races before returning home on the Sunday. After the 1939-45 war, Jim Scott moved on from Crawick Wheelers and rode for Law Wheelers in Lanarkshire; the Crawick club seems to have folded at around this time. The records set were as follows:

=== records===
1939 W.Scott Crawick Wheelers 1 h 01 min 21 s

1940 W.Scott Crawick Wheelers 1 h 00 min 54 s

1944 D.Scott Crawick Wheelers 59 min 55 s

1949 J.Scott Law Wheelers 59 min 40 s

1950 J.Scott Law Wheelers 59 min 37 s

1952 J.Scott Law Wheelers 59 min 11 s

The 1944 time set by Dave Scott was the first time a Scottish rider had posted a time of less than 1 hour for the distance.

=== Team Records ===
1950 Law Wheelers: J. Scott, A. Williams &amp; A. Hamilton, 3 h 01 min 39 s

=== 30-Mile Records ===
1939 W. Scott (Crawick Wheelers), 1 h 13 min 59 s

1950 J. Scott (Law Wheelers), 1 h 13 min 22 s

The record set by Bill Scott stood for 11 years before being beaten by his brother Jim.

=== Team Records ===
1943 Crawick Wheelers: D. Scott, J. Scott &amp; J. Tudhope, 3 h 50 min 56 s

=== Records ===
1939 W. Scott (Crawick Wheelers), 2 h 04 min 52 s

1944 J. Tudhope (Crawick Wheelers), 2 h 04 min 50 s

1949 J. Scott (Law Wheelers), 2 h 02 min 45 s

=== Team Records ===
1944 Crawick Wheelers: J. Tudhope, D. Scott &amp; J. McKay, 6 h 30 min 27 s

A number of cycling trophies won by Dave Scott are on display in the Sanquhar Tollbooth Museum.

== Local festivities ==
The town celebrates the granting of its Royal Charter on the 3rd Saturday in August each year. The day consists of a procession of horses, decorated floats and massed pipes and drums around the town. The town also celebrated 100 years of Riding the Marches in 2010.

==Neighbouring hills==
Sanquhar sits in Nithsdale in close proximity to ranges of interesting hills on either side, the Carsphairn and Scaur range to the west and the Lowther hills to the south east. These hills offer excellent possibilities for the outdoor enthusiast. The Southern Upland Way passes through the town on its way from Portpatrick on Scotland&#x27;s west coast to Cockburnspath on the east.

<doc id="141945" wikidata="Q206934" url="?curid=141945" title="Midlothian">
<text>Midlothian (; ) is registration county, lieutenancy area and one of 32 council areas of Scotland used for local government. Midlothian lies in the east-central Lowlands, bordering the City of Edinburgh council area, East Lothian and the Scottish Borders. The modern council area was formed in 1975 when the historic county of Midlothian, also known as Edinburghshire, was altered substantially as part of local government reforms; its southern part formed a new Midlothian District within the Region of Lothian, whilst areas on the peripheries were assigned to other districts and the city of Edinburgh, which had always been autonomous to an extent, was formally separated as the City of Edinburgh District. In 1996 Midlothian became a unitary authority area, using the same name and territory as in 1975.

==History==
Midlothian County Council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties and burghs as administrative areas and created a new two-tier system of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Most of Midlothian&#x27;s territory went to a new district called Midlothian within the Lothian region. The Midlothian district was smaller than the area of the pre-1975 county, parts of which went to other districts: Currie, Balerno, Ratho and Newbridge to the city of Edinburgh; Musselburgh burgh and parish of Inveresk (which included the villages of Inveresk, Wallyford and Whitecraig) to East Lothian; East Calder, Mid Calder and West Calder) and the Midlothian part of Livingston to West Lothian; Heriot and Stow parishes to the Ettrick and Lauderdale district of the Borders region. 

The boundaries of the historic county of Midlothian, including the city of Edinburgh, are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county. The Midlothian lieutenancy area corresponds to the current council area rather than the historic county. The last lord-lieutenant of the county of Midlothian was made lord-lieutenant for the new district of Midlothian when the reforms came into effect in 1975. The former county council&#x27;s headquarters in Edinburgh became the offices of the new Lothian Regional Council, whilst the Midlothian District Council established its headquarters in Dalkeith. 

In 1991 the council built itself a new headquarters called Midlothian House at 40-46 Buccleuch Street in Dalkeith.

The Lothian region was abolished in 1996. The four districts in the region, including Midlothian, became unitary council areas. The reconstituted Midlothian Council continues to be based at Midlothian House in Dalkeith.

===Central government===

There is a Midlothian constituency of the House of Commons.

There was a Midlothian constituency of the Scottish Parliament up to the 2011 elections when it was divided between Midlothian North and Musselburgh and Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.

==Geography==

The Midlothian council area contains the towns of Dalkeith, Bonnyrigg and Penicuik, as well as a portion of the Pentland Hills Regional Park, Rosslyn Chapel and Dalkeith Palace.

<text>Stranraer ( , ; ), also known as The Toon or The Cleyhole, is a town in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, on Loch Ryan and the northern side of the isthmus joining the Rhins of Galloway to the mainland. Stranraer is Dumfries and Galloway&#x27;s second-largest town, with a population of 10,593.

Stranraer is the administrative centre for the Wigtownshire area of Dumfries and Galloway. It was formerly a ferry port, connecting Scotland with Belfast and Larne in Northern Ireland; the service was transferred to nearby Cairnryan in 2011. It lies south-west of Glasgow, south-west of Ayr and west of Dumfries.

The name comes from Scottish Gaelic, &quot;An t-Sròn Reamhar&quot;, meaning &quot;the broad headland&quot; or &quot;the fat nose&quot;.

==History==
The Battle of Loch Ryan was fought near Stranraer on 9/10 February 1307 during the Scottish Wars of Independence. King Robert I of Scotland&#x27;s invasion of his ancestral lands in Annandale and Carrick began in 1307. The Annandale and Galloway invasion force was led by his brothers Alexander de Brus and Thomas de Brus, Malcolm McQuillan, Lord of Kintyre, an Irish sub-king and Sir Reginald de Crawford. The force consisted of 1,000 men and 18 galleys. They sailed into Loch Ryan and landed near Stranraer.

The invasion force was quickly overwhelmed by local forces, led by Dungal MacDouall, who was a supporter of the Balliols, Comyns and King Edward I of England, and only two galleys escaped. All the leaders were captured. MacDouall summarily executed the Irish sub-king and Malcolm McQuillan, Lord of Kintyre. Alexander, Thomas and Reginald de Crawford were sent to Carlisle, England, where they were executed. The heads of McQuillan and two Irish chiefs were sent to King Edward I.

On 12 November 1595, the &quot;Clashant of Stranrawer&quot; was named part of Ninian Adair&#x27;s lands of Barony and, in 1596, was erected into a burgh of barony, the Barony of Kinhilt. This is recorded in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland. The partial translation into English is: At Linlithgow, 12 November 1595, the King confirms and for faithful service again dedicates to Ninian Adair of Kinhilt, and the legitimate male heirs of his body, which failing his nearest legitimate male heirs whosoever bear the name and insignia of Adair[, various lands...] In addition, the King creates the village at Clauchane de Stranraer as a free burgh of the barony with a free port, called the Burgh and Port of Stranraer; and the said Ninian etc shall have the authority to appoint a bailiff, treasurer, Dean of Guild, magistrate, burgesses, officials etc; and the burgesses shall have the authority and leave to pack and unpack [meaning the selling of bulk merchandise (wholesale trade) allowed by law only by free men in a free burgh], to buy and sell [also allowed only in a free burgh] etc; [...] and the said Ninian etc shall have authority to hold the position of governor of the said burgh, [...] to hold weekly markets on Saturday, with free (untaxed) market days twice a year, viz Saint Barnabas&#x27; day the 11th of June, and at Peter&#x27;s Imprisonment called Lammas on the 1st of August, [...] and the said Ninian etc shall have authority over all the port customs of the said burgh raised by sea or land among the land tenents of the said burgh and support of the said port; and the said Ninian etc shall have authority to receive resignations of lands of the said burgh etc [i.e. recover his lands from towns people who choose to sell them or give them up]; from those persons whatsoever who chose to dispose of them; the townspeople may meet three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

By 1600, Stranraer had become the market town for western Wigtownshire. Around this time, Stranraer was reached by a military road built from Dumfries to allow easier access to Portpatrick for transportation of people to Ireland for the Plantation of Ulster. Stranraer became a royal burgh in 1617.

The first harbour in Stranraer was built in the mid-18th century, with further port development in the 1820s. The arrival of the railway from Dumfries in 1861 (closed 1965), giving the shortest journey to/from London, finally established Stranraer as the area&#x27;s main port. In 1862, the line was extended to serve the harbour directly, and a link to Portpatrick was also opened. In 1877, a rail connection north to Girvan and Glasgow was also established. Stranraer remained the main Scottish port for the Irish ferries for the next 150 years or so. On 31 January 1953, 133 people died when the &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; sank near Belfast Lough after its car deck was swamped by heavy seas.

Stranraer and its surrounding area saw a significant amount of activity during the Second World War, as it became a focus for anti-U-boat work. Flying boats operated from the area in an attempt to secure the waters of the North Channel and the south western coast of Scotland. Almost all of Britain&#x27;s shipping imports passed through those two sea areas en route to the Clyde or the Mersey. Indeed, the flying boat &quot;Supermarine Stranraer&quot; is named after the town. Winston Churchill himself departed from Stranraer in a Boeing Flying Boat on the night of 25 June 1942, when making his second visit of the war to the United States. Churchill also spent time at nearby Knockinaam Lodge during the war years.

Stranraer has an active local history trust, which publishes work on the area&#x27;s history, commissioned from local authors.

==Transport==
Stranraer railway station is the southern terminus of a branch of the Glasgow South Western Line. ScotRail provides five services per day to Ayr, with one train extending to and another onto .
Connections to the West Coast Main Line can be made at Glasgow Central or indirectly via ; Avanti West Coast inter-city services reach London Euston and other destinations such as , and .

The A77 runs north towards Ayr, Prestwick and Glasgow. The A75 runs east from Stranraer to Gretna, with links to the M6 going to Carlisle. The A75 is part of European route E18, but, like all European routes, it is not signposted as such in the United Kingdom.

Local bus transport in and around the town is provided predominantly by Stagecoach West Scotland, along with local companies including Wigtownshire Community Transport and McCulloch&#x27;s Coaches. Scottish Citylink operates a service to Glasgow.

In November 2011, Stena Line relocated its ferry services to a new port at Old House Point, north of Cairnryan, which is a few miles north of Stranraer. The existing port in Stranraer may be redeveloped with the departure of Stena Line; proposals to build a transport hub have been made.

==Economy==
The main industries in the area are the ferry port, with associated industries, tourism and, more traditionally, farming.

==Redevelopment==
The European Union was partly financing &quot;The Stranraer and Loch Ryan Waterfront Project&quot; to regenerate the area.

At an estimated cost of £1.29m, the Castle Square development was the first phase of the redevelopment of Stranraer town centre and significantly changed the flow of traffic, with Castle Street and George Street both being narrowed in a bid to be more pedestrian friendly. By January 2010, work on the streets around the town centre was complete, with the streets around the Castle of St John re-paved and re-profiled. The Castle Square was formally unveiled in March 2011 and has so far hosted a range of activities, including music and family events.

Stranraer is currently undergoing redevelopment in the South Central Area (known as Dick&#x27;s Hill, Ochtrelure and the southern part of Liddesdale Road area into the Gallow Hill).

==Historic and notable buildings==
The Castle of St John is a medieval tower house, built around 1500 by the Adairs of Kilhilt. It has been used as a home, a court, a prison, and a military garrison, the last during the Killing Time in the 1680s. The Old Town Hall, built in 1776, now houses the Stranraer Museum with its displays of Victorian Wigtownshire and the town&#x27;s polar explorers, Sir John Ross and his nephew James Clark Ross. The town is also home to the North West Castle, built in 1820 and the first hotel in the world with its own indoor curling ice rink.

==Tourist attractions==

* Ardwell Gardens – landscape gardens
* Castle Kennedy Gardens – a garden between two lochs, noted for its rhododendrons, azaleas and embothriums in the grounds of Lochinch Castle, the seat of the Earls of Stair.

==Education==
The town of Stranraer has five primary schools: Belmont, Park, Rephad, Sheuchan and St. Joseph&#x27;s R.C., while villages in the local area usually have their own local school or nursery.

The secondary school, Stranraer Academy, is a comprehensive school consisting of one modern building (New Building Phase 2 completed in 2010). The school has around 1,200 pupils, 90 members of staff and serves the area of Stranraer, the Rhins, and parts of the Machars, Wigtownshire. Stranraer Academy has another seven associated primary schools from areas outwith Stranraer: Glenluce, Castle Kennedy, Drummore, Kirkcolm, Leswalt, Sandhead and Portpatrick. The original Stranraer Academy was opened in 1845 on the site of the present Stranraer Campus of Dumfries and Galloway College. In 1965, a new Academy (B Block) was built alongside a new High School (A Block) and in 1970 the schools amalgamated.

Dumfries and Galloway College has a campus in the town. In 1990, the John Niven Further Education College was built on Academy Street in the town; it has since been absorbed into the Dumfries and Galloway College.

==Sport==
The town is the home of Stranraer F.C., the local semi-professional football team who play at Stair Park. They currently play in Scottish League Two.

The rugby team Wigtownshire RFC are based in the town, playing at London Road Playing Fields, opposite Stair Park and are currently in West League Division 2.

Also at Stair Park are BMX and skateboarding ramps, and all-weather tennis and netball courts. The town also has a swimming pool (with flume), fitness suite, gymnasium and large sports hall at the council-run Ryan Centre, as well as other football fields, parks and all-weather multi-purpose pitches.

Throughout the years, Stranraer has also been a centre of excellence for Scottish curling. The town boasts the first hotel in the world with an indoor curling ice rink (North West Castle), and was the birthplace of Hammy McMillan, a World Champion curler, and current resident. The town is host to a number of annual curling championships, including the Scottish Ladies Curling Championship and the World Juniors Curling Championship.

In 2019, the Scottish Coastal Rowing world championships, Skiffieworld, was held at Stranraer between 7 and 13 July. Over 50 clubs raced St Ayles Skiffs during the week.

==Public services==
NHS Dumfries and Galloway provides healthcare services in the town. The Galloway Community Hospital opened in 2006; it replaced the town&#x27;s Garrick and Dalrymple hospitals. GP services are based in the Waverly Medical Centre, adjacent to the new hospital.

The town has several care homes for the elderly, the biggest being Thorneycroft on the edges of the town, run by the Park Homes UK company.

<text>Omarama () is a small town (population 291 as of the 2018 census) at the junction of State Highways 8 and 83, near the southern end of the Mackenzie Basin, in the South Island of New Zealand. Omarama is in the Waitaki District, in the southern Canterbury region. The Ahuriri River is a short distance to the north of the township. Omarama is 30 km (20 minutes drive) southwest of Twizel, 40 km (30 minutes drive) southeast of Lake Ōhau and 32 km (21 minutes drive) northeast of the Lindis Pass.

Omarama is primarily a rural service centre, providing local farmers and other residents with necessities and facilities such as grocery shopping, fuel and mechanical services, as well as a post shop.

In more recent years these and similar services have expanded moderately, due to the increase in new residents and visitors, including anglers, artists, astronomers, sailplane enthusiasts, skiers and general tourists.

A significant proportion of permanent village residents are employees of, or contractors to, Meridian Energy Limited, a state-owned enterprise which is responsible for the nearby dams and powerstations that are part of New Zealand&#x27;s hydroelectricity generation.

The Māori language name means &quot;Place of Light&quot;, a reference to its extraordinarily pure and clear sky.

== History ==
The Omarama area had numerous important food sources () for the Ngāi Tahu Māori (tribe) in what would later be named the Mackenzie Basin.

The first European to visit Omarama was Walter Mantell, in December 1852. European settlement began in 1857 with the establishment of the Benmore and Ben Ohau stations.

In 1877, Hipa Te Maihāroa with over 100 supporters travelled up the Waitaki River to Omarama and camped there to reaffirm the Ngāi Tahu claim to the interior of the South Island. This led to numerous visits from the government and Ngāi Tahu leaders. In 1879, they were evicted by an armed constabulary. Te Maiharoa and his followers then moved to the mouth of the Waitaki River.

== Agriculture ==

Although traditionally sheep country, Omarama area farms, along with those within the rest of the Mackenzie Basin, have rapidly converted to predominantly dairy farming, due to falling sheep meat and wool prices, and the recent boom in dairy product earnings.

The dairy conversion has made major changes to the local environment, with iconic tussock lands being ploughed and replaced by pasture, facilitated by new irrigation schemes. Large centre pivot irrigators and private canal networks now dominate much of the landscape.

Recently however, diminishing returns on dairy-based agriculture have led to farmers investigating alternative methods and practices, some now experimenting with biofuel crops.

== Angling ==

There are many rivers and lakes in and near Omarama suitable for recreational fishing. The nearby Ahuriri River is a noted fly-fishing river and adjacent Lake Benmore and Lake Ōhau are popular with boaters, as well as fly casters and other anglers.

Commonly encountered local fish species include salmon, and brown and rainbow trout.

== Astronomy ==

Omarama is home of the annual mid winter star party. Local street lighting and other light sources are dimmed or switched off for the duration of the event.

Benmore Peak Observatory is located approximately 13 km north of Omarama, atop the nearby Benmore Range.
== Gliding ==

Due to the strong gliding conditions in the Omarama area, and Mackenzie Basin, it is known as a world-class gliding location, gaining fame among sailplane pilots around the world after hosting the 1995 World Gliding Championships.

Pilots come to Omarama to experience strong lee wave conditions, ridge soaring and thermal flying. It is common for Omarama-based gliders to soar hundreds of kilometres along the Southern Alps each day. In ideal conditions, it is possible for gliders to reach distances in excess of 2000 km. Several national and world gliding records have been achieved from Omarama, and the prevailing conditions have attracted record seekers such as Steve Fossett.

The Omarama Gliding Club and several commercial gliding organisations are based in the town.

== Snow sports ==

There are three skifields within the MacKenzie Basin; Ōhau, Round Hill, and Mount Dobson.

== Mountain biking ==
Omarama is on the route of the Alps to Ocean Cycle Trail, after the trail was constructed following approval in 2010. 

== Other attractions ==
Omarama is a popular holiday destination amongst those living in surrounding districts and provinces, many owning family holiday residences within the village. Tramping is also popular with locals and visitors alike, due to the spectacular and often rugged landscape. Due to the spectacular scenery, numerous artists regularly visit the Omarama area, and several are now permanent residents, exhibiting their Omarama and Mackenzie landscapes and other work in local galleries and further afield.

== Education ==
Omarama School was first built on Buscot Station in the 1930s. It was moved to its present site on State Highway 8 in Omarama during the 1940s. As a result of people moving to work at the local hydro electricity development, Omarama School increased in size to a four-teacher school in the late 1980s. Today, 2.5 FTE of teachers teach at the school and its catchment area serves Omarama and a wide area of the Upper Waitaki high country. Omarama School caters for new entrants to Year 8 children with two classrooms, a school library and a covered solar heated pool on a 11938 square metre site. Omarama School has a roll of students as of 

== Government ==
Omarama is part of the Waitaki Electorate. The Waitaki District Council provide local government services to Omarama. In 2020, the Waitaki District Council published a masterplan for developing Omarama.

==In popular culture==
In his novel &quot;The Zombie Survival Guide&quot;, Max Brooks of &quot;World War Z&quot; fame makes reference to Omarama as site of a historical zombie attack.

Disney&#x27;s movie &quot;Mulan&quot; released in 2020 was partially filmed at the Omarama Clay Cliffs.

<doc id="141949" wikidata="Q1026315" url="?curid=141949" title="Gretna Green">
<text>Gretna Green is a parish in the southern council area of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, close to the town of Gretna, on the Scottish side of the English-Scottish border.

It is accessed from the A74(M) motorway. 
Historically Gretna Green was on the Glasgow-Carlisle road, a significant early toll road between England and Scotland.

Gretna Green railway station serves both Gretna Green and Gretna. The Quintinshill rail disaster, the worst rail crash in British history, in which over 220 died, occurred near Gretna Green in 1915.

Gretna Green is most famous for its &quot;runaway marriages&quot;.

==Marriage==

Gretna&#x27;s &quot;runaway marriages&quot; began in 1754 when Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s Marriage Act came into force in England. Under the Act, if a parent of a person under the age of 21 objected to the minor&#x27;s marriage, the parent could legally veto the union. The Act tightened the requirements for marrying in England and Wales but did not apply in Scotland, where it was possible for boys to marry at 14 and girls at 12 with or without parental consent (see Marriage in Scotland). It was, however, only in the 1770s, with the construction of a toll road passing through the hitherto obscure village of Graitney, that Gretna Green became the first easily reachable village over the Scottish border.

Scottish law allowed for &quot;irregular marriages&quot;, meaning that if a declaration was made before two witnesses, almost anybody had the authority to conduct the marriage ceremony. The blacksmiths in Gretna became known as &quot;anvil priests&quot;, culminating with Richard Rennison, who performed 5,147 ceremonies. The local blacksmith and his anvil became lasting symbols of Gretna Green weddings.

Victorian chronicler Robert Smith Surtees described Gretna Green at length in his 1848 &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; serial, &quot;The Richest Commoner in England&quot;: &lt;poem&gt;Few of our readers—none we should think of our fair ones—but at some period or other of their lives, have figured to themselves the features of Gretna Green. Few we should think but have pictured to themselves the chaise stained &quot;with the variations of each soil&quot;, the galloping bustle of the hurrying postboys, urging their foaming steeds for the last stage that bears them from Carlisle to the border. It is a place whose very name is typical of brightening prospects. The poet sings of the greenest spot on memory&#x27;s waste, and surely Gretna Green was the particular spot he had under consideration. Gretna Green! The mind pictures a pretty straggling, half Scotch, half English village, with clean white rails, upon a spacious green, and happy rustics in muffin caps, and high cheek bones, looking out for happier couples to congratulate. Then the legend of the blacksmith who forged the links of love, added interest to the place, and invested the whole with fairy feature.

How much better, brighter, more promising, in short, a Gretna Green marriage sounds than a Coldstream or Lamberton toll-bar one! and yet they are equally efficacious. Gretna Green indeed, is as superior in reality as it is in name. It looks as if it were the capital of the God of Love, while the others exhibit the bustling, trading, money-making pursuits of matter-of-fact life. Though we dare say Gretna Green is as unlike what most people fancy, still we question that any have gone away disappointed. It is a pretty south country-looking village, much such as used to exist in the old days of posting and coaching. A hall house converted into an hotel, and the dependents located in the neighbouring cottages. Gretna Hall stands a little apart from the village on the rise of what an Englishman would call a gentle eminence, and a Scotchman a dead flat, and is approached by an avenue of stately trees, while others are plentifully dotted about, one on the east side, bearing a board with the name of the house, the host and high-priest, &quot;Mr. Linton&quot;. There is an air of quiet retirement about it that eminently qualifies it for its holy and hospitable purpose.&lt;/poem&gt;

Since 1929, both parties in Scotland have had to be at least 16 years old, but they still may marry without parental consent. Since April 2022 in England and Wales, the minimum age for marriage is now 18 irrespective of parental consent. Of the three forms of irregular marriage that had existed under Scottish law, all except cohabitation by habit and repute were abolished by the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1939.

Gretna&#x27;s two blacksmiths&#x27; shops and countless inns and smallholding became the backdrops for tens of thousands of weddings. Today there are several wedding venues in and around Gretna Green, from former churches to purpose-built chapels. The services at all the venues are always performed over an iconic blacksmith&#x27;s anvil.

=== Elsewhere ===
In common law, a &quot;Gretna Green marriage&quot; came to mean, in general, a marriage transacted in a jurisdiction that was not the residence of the parties being married, to avoid restrictions or procedures imposed by the parties&#x27; home jurisdiction. A notable &quot;Gretna&quot; marriage was the second marriage in 1826 of Edward Gibbon Wakefield to the young heiress Ellen Turner, called the Shrigley abduction (his first marriage was also to an heiress, but the parents wanted to avoid a public scandal). Other towns in which quick, often surreptitious marriages could be obtained came to be known as &quot;Gretna Greens&quot;. In the United States, these have included Elkton, Maryland, Reno and, later, Las Vegas.

In 1856 Scottish law was changed due to a measure passed in Parliament by Alexander Colquhoun-Stirling-Murray-Dunlop to require 21 days&#x27; residence for marriage, and a further law change was made in 1940. The residential requirement was lifted in 1977. Other Scottish border villages used for such marriages were Coldstream Bridge, Lamberton, Mordington and Paxton Toll, and Portpatrick for people coming from Ireland.

<doc id="141950" wikidata="Q532662" url="?curid=141950" title="Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church">
<text>The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (MOSC) also known as the Indian Orthodox Church (IOC) or simply as the Malankara Church, is an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox church headquartered in Devalokam, near Kottayam, India. It serves India&#x27;s Saint Thomas Christian (also known as &quot;Nasrani&quot;) population. According to tradition, these communities originated in the missions of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century (circa 52 AD). It employs the Malankara Rite, an Indian form of the West Syriac liturgical rite.

The MOSC descends from the Malankara Church and its affiliation with the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, between 1909 and 1912, a schism over the authority of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch resulted in the dissolution of the unified Malankara Church and establishment of the overlapping and conflicting MOSC and Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (JSCC). Since 1912, the MOSC has maintained a catholicate, the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan of Malankara Orthodox Church–presently Baselios Marthoma Mathews III–who is the primate of the church. 

The MOSC drafted and formally adopted a constitution in 1934, in order to define the relationship it has with the Syriac Orthodox Church and the patriarch, wherein it defined itself a division of the Syriac Orthodox Church with its supreme spiritual leader being the Patriarch of Antioch. However the constitution stipulated that all the spiritual duties of the patriarch in the Malankara Church was entrusted to the Catholicos of the East and reiterated that its administration was the prerogative of the Malankara Metropolitan. The constitution further declared that the positions of the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan are to be held by the same person from then on, who shall henceforth act as the spiritual and administrative head of the church. The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church asserts communion with the other Oriental Orthodox churches. However, regular legal and occasional physical confrontations between the MOSC and the Syriac Orthodox JSCC have continued despite multiple efforts to reconcile the churches.

The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church accepts miaphysitism, which holds that in the one person of Jesus Christ, divinity and humanity are united in one (μία, &quot;mia&quot;) nature (φύσις – &quot;physis&quot;) without separation, without confusion, without alteration and without mixing where Christ is consubstantial with God the Father. Around 500 bishops within the Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem refused to accept the dyophysitism (two natures) doctrine decreed by the 4th ecumenical council, the Council of Chalcedon in 451, an incident that resulted in the second major split in the main body of the Christian Church (after the Nestorian schism). While the Oriental Orthodox churches rejected the Chalcedonian definition, the sees that would later become the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church accepted this council.

Self-reporting roughly 2.5 million members (with external estimates of roughly 1 million) across 32 dioceses worldwide, a significant proportion of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church&#x27;s adherents reside in the southern India state of Kerala with the Malankara communities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka,South America, Australia and New Zealand.

==History==
===Early history===
According to tradition, Christianity first arrived in India with Thomas the Apostle during the 1st century AD, evolving into Saint Thomas Christianity over several centuries. While isolated and generally independent in administration, Indian Christians maintained contact with the Christian hierarchies of Antioch, Persia, and potentially Alexandria. The Saint Thomas Christians had relationships with the Persian Church of the East from at least the 6th century onward. The Indians inherited its East Syriac dialect for liturgical use and gradually became Syriac Christians in ritual and doctrine. They received clerical support from Persian bishops, who traveled to Kerala in merchant ships on the spice route. For much of this period, Saint Thomas Christians were under the leadership of an archdeacon (a native ecclesiastical head with temporal powers, deriving from the Greek &quot;arkhidiākonos&quot;).

During the 16th century, efforts by the Portuguese &quot;Padroado&quot;–an arm of the Catholic Church–to bring the Saint Thomas Christians under the administration of the Latin Church and attempts to Latinize the Malankara Rite led to the first of several rifts in the community. These divisions intensified following the 1599 Synod of Diamper. Saint Thomas Christians who were opposed to the Portuguese Padroado missionaries took the Coonan Cross Oath on 3 January 1653. The Dutch East India Company expulsion of the Portuguese from much of Malabar enabled the reconciliation of some Saint Thomas Christians and the Catholic Church, with this group eventually evolving into the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, an Eastern Catholic church that adopted the Chaldean Catholic Church&#x27;s East Syriac Rite and Diophysite christology.

===Malankara Church===

Many Saint Thomas Christian chose to remain independent from the Catholic Church. Patriarch Gregorios Abdal Jaleel, the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop of Jerusalem, witnessed the 1665 ordination of Thomas as Bishop Thoma I, who forged a renewed relationship with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch and Saint Thomas Christians, which laid the foundation for adopting West Syrian liturgy and practices over the next two centuries. Those who supported the indigenous church leader of Malankara, Thoma I, and adopted West Syrian liturgies and practices and Miaphysite faith evolved into the Malankara Church.

===19th century===
The Arthat Padiyola declared that the administration of Malankara Church was independent and the bishops from Rome, Antioch, and Babylon had no role in the Malankara Church hierarchy, despite continued efforts to integrate the remaining independent Saint Thomas Christians into these patriarchates. In 1807, four gospels of Holy Bible in Syriac were translated to Malayalam by Kayamkulam Philipose Ramban. The Malankara Orthodox Theological Seminary in Kottayam was established in 1815 under the leadership of Pulikottil Ittup Ramban (Mar Dionysius II). The Mavelikara Synod (Padiyola) led by Cheppad Mar Dionysius rejected the suggestions put forward by Anglican missioneries and Reformation group and declared the beliefs and theology of Malankara Church were same as the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.

===20th century===
Geevarghese Dionysius of Vattasseril, who became the Malankara metropolitan bishop in 1908, played a significant role with the other clerical and lay leaders of Malankara in re-establishing the Catholicos of the East in India in 1912. In 1909 the relations with the Syrian Orthodox Church soured, when Patriarch Ignatius Abded Aloho II who arrived in India, began demanding registered deeds granting the patriarch temporal authority over the church. Dionysius rejected the request and thus emerged two factions in the church. The faction that supported the Patriarch came to be called as &quot;Bava Kakshi&quot; (Patriarch Faction) and the faction that supported the Malankara Metropolitan came to be known as &quot;Methran Kakshi&quot; (Metropolitan Faction). The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church wanted to retain its autocephaly, and appealed to Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Abdul Masih II. He enthroned Murimattathil Paulose Ivanios as Baselios Paulose I, Catholicos of the East, on the apostolic throne of St. Thomas at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Niranam on 15 September 1912.

In 1934, The Malankara Church adopted a constitution for smooth functioning of the church, parishes and institution. In 1947, Saint Gregorios of Parumala was declared as a saint by the Church. In 1952 the Official Residence of the Malankara Metropolitan and the Headquarters of Malankara Church was shifted to Devalokam from Pazhaya Seminary. In 1958, The Supreme Court declared Catholicos Baselios Geevarghese II as the legitimate Malankara Metropolitan. The two factions of the Malankara Orthodox Church rejoined. In 1964, Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch participated in the enthronement ceremony of the Catholicos and Malankara Metropolitan, Baselios Augen I. In 1995, the Supreme Court of India declared the MOSC constitution adopted in 1934 was valid.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, fresh elections were conducted in Malankara Association under the observation of Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court declared Catholicos Baselios Marthoma Mathews II is the official and legitimate Malankara Metropolitan and also declared that this decision cannot be disputed in any platform. In 2003, Vattasheril Dionysius VI was declared as a saint. In 2012, the centennial of the establishment of the church and Catholicate were celebrated with history classes and church publications. On 3 July 2017, a major verdict by the Supreme Court of India declared the MOSC legally applicable to all parishes in disputed possession between the MOSC and Jacobite Syrian Christian Church.
==Hierarchy and doctrine==

The spiritual head of the church is the Catholicos of the East, and its temporal head is the Malankara Metropolitan. Since 1934, both titles have been vested in one person; the official title of the head of the church is &quot;The Catholicos of the Apostolic Throne of Saint Thomas and The Malankara Metropolitan&quot;. Baselios Marthoma Mathews III was enthroned as the Malankara Metropolitan and the Catholicos of the East. He is the eighth Catholicose of the East in Malankara and the 21st Malankara Metropolitan.

Oriental Orthodox Churches, including the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, accept only the first three ecumenical councils: the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople, and the Council of Ephesus. The church, like all other Oriental Orthodox Churches, uses the original Nicene Creed without the filioque clause. Like the Syriac Orthodox Church, it primarily uses the liturgy of Saint James in Malayalam, Konkani, Kannada, Hindi, English and other Indian languages.

=== Liturgy and canonical hours ===
The church has used the Malankara Rite, part of the Antiochene Rite, since the 17th century. The Jacobite Church and the Maronite Church also belong to the same liturgical family. In the first half of the fifth century, the Antiochene church adopted the Liturgy of Saint James. In the 4th and 5th centuries, The liturgical language of fourth- and fifth-century Jerusalem and Antioch was Greek, and the original liturgy was composed in Greek.

After the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Eastern Church was divided in two; one group accepted the council, and the other opposed it. Both groups continued to use the Greek version of the Saint James liturgy. The Byzantine emperor Justin (518–527) expelled the opponents from Antioch, and they took refuge in the Syriac-speaking Mesopotamia on the Roman–Persian border (modern eastern Syria, Iraq, and southeastern Turkey). The Antiochene liturgical rites were gradually translated into Syriac, and Syriac hymns were introduced.

Gregorios Abdal Jaleel came to Malankara from Jerusalem in 1665 and introduced Syriac Orthodox liturgical rites. The most striking characteristic of the Antiochene liturgy is its large number of anaphoras (celebrations of the Eucharist). About eighty are known, and about a dozen are used in India. All have been composed following the Liturgy of Saint James.

Christians of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church pray the canonical hours of the Shehimo at fixed prayer times seven times a day.

The liturgy of Mor Addai is still in use, in anaphora form, similar to the Maronite Sharar. The anaphora of St. John Chrysostom is sometimes used.

=== Saints ===

In conformity with other Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, and also with the Roman Catholic Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church adheres to the tradition of seeking the intercession of saints. Several have been canonized: 
* Geevarghese Gregorios of Parumala: Entombed in St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Parumala, and canonized by Geevarghese II in 1947
* Baselios Yeldo: Entombed in St. Thomas Church, Kothamangalam, and canonised by Geevarghese II in 1947
* Geevarghese Dionysius of Vattasseril: Entombed in the Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam, and canonized by Mathews II in 2003
* Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares: Entombed in St. Mary&#x27;s Orthodox Church, Ribandar, and declared a regional saint by Paulose II in 2015. (Not officially canonized a saint)
* Fr. Roque Zephrin Noronah: Entombed in St. Mary&#x27;s Orthodox Cathedral, Brahmavar, and declared a regional saint by Paulose II in 2015 (Not officially canonized a saint)

=== Metropolitan ===
The temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual administration of the church is vested in the Malankara Metropolitan, subject to the church constitution which was adopted in 1934. The Malankara Metropolitan is president of the Malankara Syrian Christian Association (Malankara Association) and its managing committee, and trustee of community properties. He is the custodian of the Pazhaya Seminary and other common properties of Malankara Syrian Community. He is also the custodian of vattipanam interest which was deposited in Travancore Government by Marthoma VII. He is elected by the Malankara association.

=== Catholicate ===
&quot;Catholicos&quot; means &quot;the general head&quot;, and can be considered equivalent to &quot;universal bishop.&quot; The early church had three priestly ranks: &quot;episcopos&quot; (bishop), priest and deacon. By the end of the third century, bishops of important cities in the Roman Empire became known as metropolitans. The fourth-century ecumenical councils recognized the authority of the metropolitan. By the fifth century, the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria and Antioch gained control of the churches in surrounding cities. They gradually became the heads of the regional churches, and were known as patriarchs (common father). 

Outside the Roman Empire, patriarchs were known as catholicos. There were four catholicates before the fifth century: the Catholicate of the East, the Catholicate of Armenia, the Catholicate of Georgia and the Catholicate of Albania. The archdeacons reigned from the fourth to the 16th centuries; in 1653, the archdeacon was elevated to bishop by the community as Mar Thoma I.

The Catholicate of the East was relocated to India in 1912, and Baselios Paulose I was seated on the apostolic throne of St. Thomas as the Catholicos of the East by the disposed Patriarch of Antioch Abdul Masih. The headquarters of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and the Catholicos of the East is the Catholicate Palace at Devalokam, Kottayam, Kerala, which was consecrated on 31 December 1951. The new palace, built in 1961, was dedicated by visiting Armenian Catholicos Vazgen I. 

The Holy Synod and Managing committee designated H.G.Dr. Mathews Mor Severios to the new Malankara Metropolitan and Catholicos of Malankara Church succeeding Baselios Marthoma Paulose II. He was consecrated as the 22nd Malankara Metropolitan during the Malankara Association that took place on 14 October 2021 at St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Parumala and enthroned as the 9th Catholicos of Malankara Church on 15 October 2021. Relics of St. Thomas are kept in the catholicate chapel, and Geevarghese II, Augen I, Mathews I and Paulose II are interred there.

==Administration==
Until the 17th century, the church was administered by the archdeacon (Malankara Moopan). The elected archdeacon was in charge of day-to-day affairs, including the ordination of deacons to the priesthood. Ordinations were performed by Persian bishops visiting India. The Malankara Palliyogam (a forerunner of the Malankara Association) consisted of elected representatives from individual parishes. The isolation of the Malankara church from the rest of Christendom preserved the apostolic age&#x27;s democratic nature through interactions with Portuguese (Roman Catholic) and British (Anglican) colonialists. From the 17th to the 20th centuries, the church had five pillars of administration:
* The Episcopal Synod, presided over by the Catholicos of the East
* The Malankara Association, presided by Malankara Metropolitan
* Three trustees: the Malankara metropolitan and priest and lay trustees
* The Malankara Association&#x27;s managing and working committees

===1934 church constitution===
Envisioned by Dionysius VI, the church&#x27;s general and day-to-day administration was codified in its 1934 constitution. The constitution was presented at the 26 December 1934 Malankara Christian Association meeting at M. D. Seminary, adopted and enacted. It has been amended three times. Although the constitution was challenged in court by dissident supporters of the Patriarch of Antioch, Supreme Court rulings in 1958, 1995, 2017 and 2018 upheld its validity.

The constitution&#x27;s first article asserts the relationship between the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Malankara Church. The second article addresses the establishment of the Malankara Church by St. Thomas and ascribes primacy to the Catholicos. The third article regards the church&#x27;s name. The fourth article describes the faith and its traditions. The fifth article examines church governance canon law.

===Malankara Association===
The elected Malankara Association, consisting of parish members, manages the church&#x27;s religious and social concerns. Formerly the Malankara Palli-yogam (മലങ്കര പള്ളി യോഗം; Malankara Parish Assembly, its modern form is believed to have been founded in 1873 as the Mulanthuruthy Synod, a gathering of parish representatives in Parumala. In 1876, the Malankara Association began.

The church constitution outlines the association&#x27;s powers and responsibilities. The Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan is the president, and the diocesan metropolitan bishops are vice-presidents. All positions are elected. Each parish is represented in the association by an elected priest and laypeople, proportional to parish-membership size.

<text>Edmond Louis Antoine Huot de Goncourt (; 26 May 182216 July 1896) was a French writer, literary critic, art critic, book publisher and the founder of the Académie Goncourt.

==Biography==
Goncourt was born in Nancy. His parents, Marc-Pierre Huot de Goncourt and Annette-Cécile de Goncourt (née Guérin), were minor aristocrats who died when he and his brother Jules de Goncourt were young adults. His father was a former cavalry officer and squadron commander in the Grande Armée of Napoleon I, and his grandfather Jean-Antoine Huot de Goncourt had been a deputy in the National Assembly of 1789. Edmond attended the pension Goubaux, the Lycée Henri IV, and the Lycée Condorcet. At the Lycée Condorcet, he studied rhetoric and philosophy from 1840 to 1842, followed by the study of law between 1842 and 1844.

After their mother&#x27;s death in 1848, the brothers inherited an income which enabled them to live independently and pursue their artistic interests. Edmond was able to leave a treasury clerkship that had made him so miserable as to contemplate suicide. For much of his life, he collaborated with Jules creating works of art criticism, a notorious journal, and subsequently several novels. Their most notable novel was &quot;Germinie Lacerteux&quot; (1865), inspired by the exploits of the brothers&#x27; housekeeper Rose, who stole from them to fund a double life of orgies and sexual encounters. It is considered one of the earliest works of French Realism to deal with the working class.
In 1852, Edmond and his brother were indicted for an &quot;outrage against public morality&quot; after they quoted erotic Renaissance poetry in an article. They were ultimately acquitted.

Edmond was known to be fascinated with Rococo and Japanese art. He also collected rare books. The brothers&#x27; house at Auteuil, which they purchased in 1868, was a showcase for their collection of 18th century French and Far Eastern art. Edmond documented the house and its interiors in his 1881 book &quot;La Maison d&#x27;un Artiste.&quot; Between 1856 and 1875, the brothers published essays on 18th century art in a collected series called &quot;L&#x27;Art du XVIIIe siècle&quot;, which revived appreciation for the Rococo.

After the death of Jules in 1870, Edmond continued to write novels alone. He also continued writing the &quot;Journal des Goncourt&quot;, which he and Jules had begun in 1851, only stopping 12 days before his death in 1896. He completed unfinished works from his collaboration with his brother, including a monograph on Paul Gavarni (1873) and a book called &quot;L&#x27;Amour au XVIIIe Siècle&quot; (1875). He revised, enlarged and reissued &quot;Les Maîtresses de Louis XV&quot; (1860) in three volumes between 1878 and 1879: &quot;La du Barry&quot;, &quot;Madame de Pompadour&quot;, and &quot;La Duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs&quot;. His last novel, &quot;Chérie&quot; (1884), about a young woman who expresses her artistic sensibility in fashion, can be read as an exploration of impressionistic art. He collected the letters of his late brother in 1885, and between 1887 and 1896 issued nine volumes of the &quot;Journal&quot;. Edmond became increasingly jealous of more successful writers like Guy de Maupassant and Émile Zola, which is reflected in scathing entries in the &quot;Journal&quot;. In 1893 he wrote of Maupassant that his &quot;success with loose society women is an indication of their vulgarity, for never have I seen a man of the world with such a red face, such common features, or such a peasant build.&quot;

He bequeathed his entire estate for the foundation and maintenance of the Académie Goncourt. In honour of his brother and collaborator, Jules de Goncourt (17 December 183020 June 1870), each December since 1903, the Académie awards the Prix Goncourt. It is the most prestigious prize in French literature, given to &quot;the best imaginary prose work of the year&quot;.

Edmond de Goncourt died in Champrosay in 1896, and was interred in the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris.

<doc id="141957" wikidata="Q784817" url="?curid=141957" title="Golden age of American animation">
<text>The golden age of [[American animation]] was a period that began with the popularization of sound synchronized cartoons in 1928 and gradually ended in the 1960s when theatrical animated shorts started to lose popularity to the newer medium of television. Animated media from after the golden age, especially on television, were produced on cheaper budgets and with more limited techniques between the late 1950s and early 1980s.

Many popular animated cartoon characters emerged from this period, including:

* Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Pluto, and Pete.
* Fleischer Studios&#x27; Popeye, Betty Boop, Bimbo, Koko the Clown, and Superman
* Warner Bros.&#x27; Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, Tweety, Sylvester and the Tasmanian Devil
* Van Beuren Studios&#x27; Felix the Cat
* Walter Lantz&#x27;s Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy
* MGM&#x27;s Tom and Jerry, Droopy, and Screwy Squirrel
* Famous Studios&#x27; Casper the Friendly Ghost, Richie Rich, Little Audrey, Little Lulu, and Baby Huey
* Screen Gems&#x27; the Fox and the Crow
* Terrytoons&#x27; Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, and Gandy Goose
* UPA&#x27;s Mr. Magoo
* DePatie-Freleng&#x27;s Pink Panther, The Inspector, and The Ant and the Aardvark

Over the course of these four decades, the quality of the media released throughout the golden age has often been debated. The peak of this era is usually cited as during the 1930s and 1940s, attributed to the theatrical run of studios including Walt Disney Animation Studios, Warner Bros. Cartoons, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoons, Paramount Cartoon Studios, Walter Lantz Productions, Terrytoons, and Fleischer Studios. In later decades, namely between the 1950s and 1960s, the era is sometimes divided into a &quot;silver age&quot; due to the emergence of studios such as UPA, DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, and Jay Ward Productions; these companies&#x27; presence in the industry would grow significantly with the rise of television following the golden age&#x27;s conclusion. Furthermore, the history of animation became very important artistically in the United States.

Feature-length animation began during this period, most notably with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Walt-era&quot; films, spanning from 1937&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and 1940&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; to 1967&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and 1970&#x27;s &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (last animated films produced before his death in 1966). During this period, several live-action films that included animation were made, such as &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1942), &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945), &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; (1953), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971), the last one being the last theatrical film to receive an Academy Award for their animated special effects. In addition, stop motion and special effects were also developed, with films such as &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953), &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), &quot;Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy&quot; (1954), &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958), &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963) and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968).

Animation also began on television during this period with &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; (the first animated series broadcast in 1948) and early versions of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; (1959), both from Jay Ward Productions. The rise of television animation is often considered to be a factor that hastened the golden age&#x27;s end. However, various authors include Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s earliest animated series through 1962 as part of the golden age, with shows like &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot; (1957), &quot;Huckleberry Hound&quot; (1958), &quot;Quick Draw McGraw&quot; (1959), &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1960), &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; (1961), &quot;Top Cat&quot; (1961), &quot;Wally Gator&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Jetsons&quot; (1962). Several of these animated series were the first to win Emmy Awards for their contribution to American television. Other Hanna-Barbera productions related to the golden age were &quot;Wacky Races&quot; (1968) and the theatrical animations with Columbia Pictures, such as &quot;Loopy De Loop&quot; (1959) and the feature films released between 1964 and 1966.

==Major Movie/Animation Studios==
===Walt Disney Productions===

====Beginnings====
Walt Disney had decided to become a newspaper cartoonist drawing political caricatures and comic strips. However, nobody would hire Disney, so his older brother Roy, who was working as a banker at the time, got him a job at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio where he created advertisements for newspapers, magazines, and movie theaters. Here he met fellow cartoonist Ub Iwerks, the two quickly became friends and in January 1920, when their time at the studio expired they decided to open up their own advertising agency together called Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. The business however got off to a rough start and Walt temporarily left for the Kansas City Film and Ad Co. to raise money for the fleeting company and Iwerks soon followed as he was unable to run the business alone.

While working there he made commercials for local theaters using crude cut-out animation. Disney became fascinated by the art and decided to become an animator. He then borrowed a camera from work and rented a book from the local library called &quot;Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development&quot; by Edwin G. Lutz and decided that cel animation would produce better quality and decided to open up his own animation studio. Disney then teamed up with Fred Harman and made their first film, &quot;The Little Artist&quot; which was nothing more than an artist (Disney) taking a cigarette break at his work desk. Harman soon dropped out of the venture, but Disney was able to strike a deal with local theater owner Frank L. Newman and animated a cartoon all by himself entitled &quot;Newman Laugh-O-Grams&quot; screened in roughly February 1921. Walt then quit his job at the film and ad company and incorporated Laugh-O-Gram Films in May 1922, and hired former advertising colleagues as unpaid &quot;students&quot; of animation including Ub Iwerks and Fred Harman&#x27;s brother, Hugh Harman.

Throughout 1922, the Disney company produced a series of &quot;modernized&quot; adaptations of fairy tales including &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, &quot;The Four Musicians of Bremen&quot;, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, &quot;Goldielocks and the Three Bears&quot;, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Tommy Tucker&#x27;s Tooth&quot;, the latter being mostly a live-action film about dental hygiene. None of these films turned a profit. The last film made by the Disney company was a short called &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;. Loosely inspired by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;; the short featured a live-action five-year-old girl named Alice (Virginia Davis) who had adventures in a fully animated world. The film was never fully complete however as the studio went bankrupt in the summer of 1923.

Upon the closure of Laugh-O-Grams, Walt Disney worked as a freelance filmmaker before selling his camera for a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. Once arriving he moved in with his Uncle Robert and his brother Roy, who was recovering at a nearby government hospital from tuberculosis he had suffered during the war. After failing to get a job as a director of live-action films he sent the unfinished &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; reel to short-subjects distributor Margaret J. Winkler of &quot;Winkler Pictures&quot; in New York. Winkler was distributing both the &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; and &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; cartoons at the time, but the Fleischer brothers were about to leave to set up their own distribution company, &quot;Red Seal Films&quot;, and Felix producer Pat Sullivan was constantly fighting with Winkler; therefore Winkler agreed to distribute Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; as sort of an insurance policy.

Once Walt Disney received the notice on October 15, he convinced Roy to leave the hospital and help him set up his business. The next day, on October 16, 1923, Disney Bros. Cartoon Studio opened its doors at a small rented office two blocks away from his uncle&#x27;s house with Roy managing business and Walt handling creative affairs. He convinced Virginia Davis&#x27;s parents which caused the first official &quot;Alice&quot; short, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Day at Sea&quot;, to be released on January 1, 1924; delayed by eleven days. Ub Iwerks was re-hired in February 1925 and the quality of animation on the &quot;Alice&quot; series improved; this prompted Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising and Carman Maxwell to follow Disney west in June 1925. Around that time, Davis was replaced with Maggie Gay and the cartoons started to focus less on the live-action scenes and more the fully animated scenes, particularly those featuring Alice&#x27;s pet sidekick Julius, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Felix the Cat. In February 1926, Disney built a larger studio at 2719 Hyperion Avenue and changed the name of the company to Walt Disney Cartoons.

In November 1923, Winkler married Charles Mintz and handed over the business to him when she became pregnant a few months later. Mintz was often described as a cold, stern and ruthless chain-smoking tyrant; one employee remembered him as &quot;a grim-faced man, with a pair of cold eyes glittering behind the pince nez&quot; and &quot;never talked to the staff. He looked us over like an admiral surveying a row of stanchions.&quot; While Winkler had offered gentle critiques and encouragement, Mintz communicated to Disney in a harsh and cruel tone. In 1927, Mintz ordered Disney to stop producing &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; due to the costs of combining live-action and animation.

Mintz managed to gain a distribution deal with Universal Studios; however it was Mintz—not Disney—that signed the deal. Disney and lead animator Ub Iwerks created &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;, who debuted in &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot; short in 1927. The Oswald series was a success and became the first hit for the Walt Disney studio.

In the spring of 1928, Disney travelled to New York to ask Mintz for a budget increase. His request was harshly denied by Mintz, who pointed out that in the contract Mintz had signed with Universal, it was Universal—not Disney—that owned the rights to the character. Mintz revealed to Disney that he had hired most of his staff away from the studio (except for Ub Iwerks, Les Clark and Wilfred Jackson who refused to leave) and threatened that unless he took a 20 per cent budget decrease, he would drop Disney and continue the Oswald series by himself. Walt refused, and Winkler Pictures dropped its distribution.

====Mickey Mouse====

While Disney was finishing the remaining cartoons for Mintz, Disney and his staff secretly came up with a new cartoon character to replace Oswald — &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.

The inspiration for Mickey has never been clear. Walt Disney said that he came up with the idea on the train ride back to Los Angeles shortly after the confrontation with Mintz, but other records say that he came up with the idea after he returned to the studio. Walt Disney once said that he was inspired by a pet mouse he once had at the old Laugh-O-Grams studio, but more commonly said that he chose a mouse because a mouse had never been the central character of a cartoon series before.

In 1928, &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; became the first entry into the Mickey Mouse series; however, it was not released because of a poor reaction from test screenings and failed to gain a distributor. The second Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; also failed to gain the attention of the audience and a distributor. Disney knew what was missing: sound. Sound film had been captivating audiences since 1927 with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and Walt decided that the next cartoon &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; would have sound. &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was not the first sound cartoon, Max and Dave Fleischer had produced &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; since 1926 after the release of the sound film &quot;Don Juan&quot;. However, they failed to keep the sound synchronized with the animation and the main focus of the cartoons were the bouncing ball sing-a-longs. The &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; were not a success and some staff members doubted whether a cartoon with sound would be successful. So Disney arranged a special preview screening with the music and sound effects being played live behind stage through a microphone. The &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; test screening was a success and managed to gain a distributor, &quot;Celebrity Pictures&quot; chief Pat Powers. However, the first attempt to synchronize the sound with the animation was a disaster with the timing being all wrong. In order to finance the second recording, Walt sold his car. This time he used a click track to keep his musicians on the beat (Disney later learned that it was easier to record the dialogue, music and sound effects first and animate to the sound). Little more than a month before &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;&#x27;s premiere, Paul Terry released his sound cartoon &quot;Dinner Time&quot;; however it was not a financial success and Walt Disney described it as &quot;a bunch of racket&quot;.

====The Golden Age of Disney====
====Beginnings (1920s–30s)====
&quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was released on November 18, 1928, and was a big success. Disney quickly gained huge dominance in the animation field using sound in his future cartoons by dubbing &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; and the nearly completed &quot;The Barn Dance&quot;. Mickey Mouse&#x27;s popularity put the animated character into the ranks of the most popular screen personalities in the world. Disney&#x27;s biggest competitor, Pat Sullivan with his &quot;Felix the Cat&quot;, was eclipsed by Mickey&#x27;s popularity and the studio closed in 1932.

Merchandising based on Disney cartoons rescued a number of companies from bankruptcy during the depths of the Depression, and Disney took advantage of this popularity to move forward with further innovations in animation.
In 1929, he launched a new series entitled the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; which was based around music with no recurring characters. However, they did not become as popular as the Mickey Mouse cartoon series.

In 1930, after a falling-out with Powers, Disney switched distributors to Columbia Pictures. However, Ub Iwerks left Walt Disney after an offer from Powers to be in charge of his own studio.

In 1932, Mickey Mouse had become an international sensation, but the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; had not. Columbia Pictures had backed out of its distribution of the series and Disney was lured to move the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; into United Artists by a budget increase.
Walt Disney then worked with the Technicolor company to create the first full three-strip color cartoon, &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;. Another great success, it became the first cartoon to win the Academy Award for the Best Animated Short Film. Shortly afterward, Disney negotiated an exclusive, but temporary deal with Technicolor so only he could use the three-strip process in animated films—no other studio was permitted to use it. However, he withheld making Mickey Mouse in color because he thought that Technicolor might boost the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;&#x27; popularity.

By 1932, Walt Disney had realized the success of animated films depended upon telling emotionally gripping stories that would grab the audience and not let go. This realization led to an important innovation around 1932–1933: a &quot;story department&quot;, separate from the animators, with storyboard artists who would be dedicated to working on a &quot;story development&quot; phase of the production pipeline.
In turn, Disney&#x27;s continued emphasis on story development and characterization resulted in another hit in 1933: &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, which is seen as the first cartoon in which multiple characters displayed unique, individual personalities and is still considered to be the most successful animated short of all time, and also featured the hit song that became the anthem in fighting the Great Depression: &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf&quot;.
In the Mickey Mouse series, he continued to add personality to his characters; this resulted in the creation of new characters such as Pluto with &quot;The Chain Gang&quot; in 1930, Goofy with &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot; in 1932 and Donald Duck in 1934 with &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; (under the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series). When Disney&#x27;s contract with Technicolor expired, the Mickey Mouse series was moved into Technicolor starting with &quot;The Band Concert&quot; in 1935. In addition, Mickey was partially redesigned for Technicolor later that year.
In 1937, Disney invented the multiplane camera, which gave an illusion of depth to the animated world. He first used this on the Academy Award-winning &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon &quot;The Old Mill&quot;. Much of Disney&#x27;s work was heavily influenced by European stories and myths, and the work of illustrators such as Doré and Busch.
Also in 1937, Disney changed distributors for the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; to RKO Radio Pictures, remaining with this distributor until the early 1950s, when they were re-issued and re-released by Disney&#x27;s new distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.

====&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937)====
In 1937, Walt Disney produced &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, the first American feature-length animated musical fantasy film. This was the culmination of four years of effort by Disney studios. Walt Disney was convinced that short cartoons would not keep his studio profitable in the long run, so he took what was seen as an enormous gamble. The critics predicted that &quot;Snow White&quot; would result in financial ruin for the studio. They said that the colors would be too bright for the audience and they would get sick of the gags and leave. However, the critics were proven wrong. &quot;Snow White&quot; was a worldwide box office success, and was universally acclaimed as a landmark in the development of animation as a serious art form.

====&quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940)====
After the success of &quot;Snow White&quot;, Disney went on to produce &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, which was released in 1940. However, costing twice as much to make as &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was not a financial success, since World War II (which began in Europe in 1939) had cut off 40% of Disney&#x27;s foreign release market. Although it was a moderate success in the United States, the domestic gross alone was not enough to make back its production budget. However, the film did receive very positive reviews and has made millions from subsequent re-releases. 
Later that year, Disney produced &quot;Fantasia&quot;. It originally started with the Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; in an attempt to recapture Mickey&#x27;s popularity, which had sharply declined due to the popularity of Max Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Donald Duck&quot;. In the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, Mickey Mouse was redesigned by Fred Moore. This redesign of Mickey is still in use today. The short featured no dialogue, only music which was conducted by Leopold Stokowski. When the budget for the short grew very expensive, Stokowski suggested to Disney that it could be a feature film with other pieces of classical music matched to animation. Disney agreed and production started. &quot;Fantasia&quot; would also become the first commercial film to be released in stereophonic sound. However, like &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; was not a financial success. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was also the first Disney film not to be received well, receiving mixed reviews from the critics. It was looked down upon by music critics and audiences, who felt that Walt Disney was striving for something beyond his reach by trying to introduce mainstream animation to abstract art, classical music, and &quot;elite&quot; subjects. However, the film would be reevaluated in later years and considered an animated masterpiece.

====&quot;Dumbo&quot; and &quot;Bambi&quot; (1941–42)====
In 1941, in order to compensate for the relative poor box office of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;, Disney produced a low-budget feature film, &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Just a few days after rough animation was complete on &quot;Dumbo&quot;, the Disney animators&#x27; strike broke out. This was caused by the Screen Cartoonist&#x27;s Guild (which had been formed in 1938), who severed many ties between Walt Disney and his staff, while encouraging many members of the Disney studio to leave and seek greener pastures. Later that year, &quot;Dumbo&quot; became a big success, the first for Disney since &quot;Snow White&quot;. The critically acclaimed film brought in much-needed revenue and kept the studio afloat. A few months after &quot;Dumbo&quot; was released in 1941, the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor. This led to the mobilization of all movie studios (including their cartoon divisions) to produce propaganda material to bolster public confidence and encourage support for the war effort. 
The war (along with the strike) shook Walt Disney&#x27;s empire, as the US Army had seized Disney&#x27;s studio as soon as the US entered World War II in December 1941. As a result, Disney put the feature films &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; (1949), &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; (1947) and &quot;Bongo&quot; (1947) on hold until the war was over.

The only feature film that was allowed to continue production was &quot;Bambi&quot;, which was released in 1942. &quot;Bambi&quot; was groundbreaking in terms of animating animals realistically. However, due to the war, &quot;Bambi&quot; failed at the box-office and received mixed reviews from the critics. This failure was to be short-lived as it grossed a considerable amount of money in the 1947 re-release.

====Wartime Era of Disney====

Disney was now fully committed to the war effort and contributed by producing propaganda shorts and a feature film entitled &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot;. &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot; did poorly at the box office and the studio lost around $500,000 as a result. The required propaganda cartoon shorts were less popular than Disney&#x27;s regular shorts, and by the time the Army ended its stay at Walt Disney Studios with the end of the war in 1945, Disney struggled to restart his studio, and had a low amount of cash on hand.
Further Disney feature films of the 1940s were modestly budgeted collections of animated short segments put together to make a feature film. These began with &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; in 1942 and continued during the war with &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; in 1944 and after the war with &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; in 1946, &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; in 1947, &quot;Melody Time&quot; in 1948, and &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; in 1949. For the feature films &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot;, &quot;Bongo&quot;, and &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot;, he condensed them into the package films &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; since Walt feared that the low-budget animation would not become profitable.
The most ambitious Disney film of this period was the 1946 film &quot;Song of the South&quot;, a musical film blending live-action and animation which drew criticism in later years for accusations of racial stereotyping.

====The Silver Age of Disney (1950–70)====
=====Early 1950s=====
In 1950, Disney produced &quot;Cinderella&quot;. &quot;Cinderella&quot; was an enormous success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1950, and became Disney&#x27;s most successful film since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and Disney&#x27;s first single-narrative feature film to be entirely animated since &quot;Bambi&quot;, as films in the interim involved some live-action.
Disney&#x27;s company started to diversify, producing live-action feature films beginning with &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950) and nature documentaries, the first of which being &quot;Seal Island&quot; (1948). As a result, Walt Disney was needed on several different units at one time and was spending less time on animation. In 1951, he released &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, a project he had been working on since the late 1930s, though it was shelved during the war. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was initially moderately successful and received mixed reviews from the critics. A few decades later, the film would be hailed as one of Disney&#x27;s greatest classics, making millions in subsequent theatrical and home video releases. In 1953, he released &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, which, like &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, had been in production since the late 1930s/early 1940s and was shelved during the war. However unlike &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was a big success both critically and financially on its first release.

When Disney&#x27;s contract with RKO expired at the end of 1953, instead of renewing it as usual, Disney was concerned about the instability of RKO (due to owner Howard Hughes&#x27; increasingly erratic control of the studio) and started distributing films through the newly created Buena Vista Distribution subsidiary. This allowed a higher budget for shorts and features than the last few years of cartoons made for RKO dictated, which made it possible to make some of the cartoons in the new CinemaScope format. However, the budget per short was nowhere near as high as it had been in the 1940s as Disney had been focusing more on live action, television, and feature animation and less on short animation. In 1953, shortly after the switch from RKO to Buena Vista, Disney released its final Mickey Mouse short, &quot;The Simple Things&quot;. From there, the studio produced fewer animated shorts by the year until the animated shorts division was eventually closed in 1956. After that, any future short cartoon work was done through the feature animation division until 1969. The last Disney animated short of the golden age of American animation, the Oscar-winning &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bird!&quot;, was released in 1969.

=====Late 1950s–60s=====
In 1955, Disney created &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, the first animated film in CinemaScope.
Upon building Disneyland in 1955, Walt Disney regained a huge amount of popularity among the public, and turned his focus to producing his most ambitious movie: &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was filmed in Super Technirama 70 mm film and in stereophonic sound like &quot;Fantasia&quot;. &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; also signaled a change in the style of drawing, with cartoony and angular characters; taking influence from UPA. Although &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was the second-highest-grossing film of 1959 (just behind &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;), the film went over budget, costing $6 million, and the film failed to make back its expenditure. The studio was in serious debt and had to cut the cost of animation. In 1960, this resulted in Disney switching to xerography, that replaced the traditional hand-inking.
First feature films that used Xerox cels were &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963) which were box-office successes. However, the Xerox resulted in films with a &quot;sketchier&quot; look and lacked the quality of the hand-inked films. According to Floyd Norman, who was working at Disney at the time, it felt like the end of an era.
On December 15, 1966, Walt Disney died of lung cancer. The last films he was involved in were &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968), &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977); since the short &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; (1966) was released during his lifetime and he was also involved in the production of &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; (1968). The animated musical comedy feature, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, and the live-action big-screen musical, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, were released in 1967, a year after his death, and &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; was released two years later, while &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; was released in 1977. &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; also won the 1968 Academy Award for Animated Short Film. After Walt Disney&#x27;s death, the animation department did not fully recover until the late 1980s and early 1990s with the Disney Renaissance.

===Paramount Pictures===
====Fleischer Studios====
====Creation====
One of Walt Disney&#x27;s main competitors was Max Fleischer, the head of Fleischer Studios, which produced cartoons for Paramount Pictures. Fleischer Studios was a family-owned business, operated by Max Fleischer and his younger brother Dave Fleischer, who supervised the production of the cartoons. The Fleischers scored successful hits with the &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons and the &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; series. Popeye&#x27;s popularity during the 1930s rivaled Mickey Mouse at times, and Popeye fan clubs sprang up across the country in imitation of Mickey&#x27;s fan clubs; in 1935, polls showed that Popeye was even more popular than Mickey Mouse. However, during the early 1930s, stricter censorship rules enforced by the new Production Code in 1934 required animation producers to remove risqué humor. The Fleischers, in particular, had to tone down the content of their Betty Boop cartoons, which waned in popularity afterwards. The Fleischers also had produced a number of &quot;Color Classics&quot; cartoons during the 1930s which attempted to emulate Walt Disney&#x27;s use of color, but the series was not a success.

=====Feature-length films=====
In 1934, Max Fleischer became interested in producing an animated feature film shortly after Walt Disney&#x27;s announcement of &quot;Snow White&quot;, however Paramount vetoed the idea. In 1936, Fleischer Studios produced the first of three two-reel &quot;Popeye&quot; Technicolor features: &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor&quot; in 1936, &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba&#x27;s Forty Thieves&quot; in 1937, and &quot;Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp&quot; in 1939. In 1938, after Disney&#x27;s success with &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, Paramount had given the Fleischers permission to produce an animated feature film and Fleischer studio relocated itself from New York to Miami, Florida in order to avoid organized unions, which became a threat to the studio after a five-month strike occurred among Fleischer Studio workers in late 1937. Fleischer Studios also sought to rapidly expand the studios staff by hiring numerous West-coast artists, including animators and writers from Disney, Warner, and MGM. Here the Fleischers produced &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; which was released in 1939. It was a small success and encouraged the Fleischers to produce more.

===== Superman and the Fall of Fleischer&#x27;s =====
On May 24th, 1941, the Fleischers gave Paramount full ownership of the studio as collateral to pay off their increasing debts left from the loans they obtained from the studio, as well as to offset the lack of revenue from unsuccessful cartoons like &quot;Stone Age&quot;, &quot;Gabby&quot;, and &quot;Animated Antics&quot;. However, they still maintained their positions as heads of their studio&#x27;s production. Under Paramount rule, the Fleischers brought Popeye into the Navy and contributed to the war effort, and would gain more success by beginning a series of spectacular &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons (the first of which was nominated for an Oscar) that have become legendary in themselves. Despite the success Superman gave the studio, a major blow to the studio would occur when the married Dave started having an adulterous affair with the Miami secretary. This led to many disputes between the Fleischer Brothers until Max and Dave were no longer speaking to each other. 

The studio planned to release their next film, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, on Christmas day. But following initial screening on December 5th, the film was shelved for unknown reasons, presumably due to the Attack on Pearl Harbor. &quot;Mr. Bug&quot; saw a very limited release by Paramount in the UK, California, and New York the following year, causing it to flop at the box office. Dave Fleischer, still maintaining his position as co-chief of his studio, had already left Fleischer Studios to work for Columbia Pictures&#x27; Screen Gems studio on November 22nd, 1941. Max would also resign in December and confirm to Paramount president Barney Balaban in January the following year. Max and Dave agreed to surrender all studio assets to Paramount, which severed the brother&#x27;s control from Fleischer Studios completely. 

Paramount renamed the studio to Famous Studios on May 22nd, 1942, but wouldn&#x27;t fully incorporate the studio until 3 days later, when the companies contract with the Fleischer brothers ran its course. The studio, in the meantime, continued to release a backlog of completed Fleischer cartoons until August of that year, with the Superman short &quot;Terror on the Midway&quot; (1942), being the last cartoon released under the Fleischer Studios brand.

====Famous Studios====
=====Turnaround efforts by Paramount=====
In the wake of the Fleischer brother&#x27;s departure, Paramount promoted three top employees, Isadore Sparber, Seymour Kneitel (Max Fleischer&#x27;s son-in-law) and Dan Gordon as production supervisors, while Sam Buchwald was placed to executive producer. Paramount also discontinued the expensive &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons in 1943, instead adapting Marge&#x27;s &quot;Little Lulu&quot; comic strip to theaters, as well as downsizing the studio and moving it back to New York City earlier that year. 

In concept, Famous Studios continued where Fleischer Studios ended off, with the studio continuing to produce Popeye cartoons, which shifted to color in 1943 as well as creating &quot;Noveltoons&quot;, an anthology short series similar to Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Color Classics&quot;. The &quot;Noveltoons&quot; shorts series introduced many of Famous&#x27; recurring characters such as &quot;Blackie the Lamb&quot;, &quot;Wolfie&quot; (Blackie&#x27;s main rival), &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot; (created by Joe Oriolo and Seymour Reit from an unpublished children&#x27;s book), &quot;Little Audrey&quot; (a character similar to and replaced Little Lulu), &quot;Herman and Katnip&quot; (A cat and mouse duel similar to &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;), and &quot;Baby Huey&quot;. Famous also revived &quot;Screen Songs&quot;, another series inherited from Fleischer&#x27;s. The series was renamed &quot;Kartunes&quot; in 1951 and would continue for two more years before being discontinued. Buchwald later died from a heart attack in 1951, leaving Sparber and Kneitel as the sole producers. Dave Tendlar was promoted to director in 1953.

=====Decline and closure=====
The departure of the Fleischer brothers and had a prolonged effect on the studio: the Paramount cartoons of the 1940s continued to be entertaining, popular and still retained most of the Fleischer style and gloss, however animation fans and historians would note the studio&#x27;s diverging tone by the turn of the decade, as the style was criticized for its highly formulaic story telling, a shifted appeal geared more towards children, unusually violent gags, and a lack of artistic ambition or sophistication that management under the Fleischer brothers strove for. 

By October 1956, Paramount gained further control of the studio by downsizing it again and renaming it to &quot;Paramount Cartoon Studios&quot;. The following year, the studio ended Popeye&#x27;s theatrical run, with &quot;Spooky Swabs&quot; (directed by Sparber, who died the next year) being the last short of the series. Further perpetuated were the more strict budgets, forcing the studio use limited animation techniques comparable to television animation at the time. Paramount would continue to release theatrical cartoons into the 60s, but also began dabbling into television production, such as co-producing the &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; TV series, &quot;The New Casper Cartoon Show&quot; and &quot;Felix the Cat&quot;. Their new theatrical cartoons at this time included &quot;Modern Madcaps, The Cat, Swifty and Shorty,&quot; and &quot;Comic Kings.&quot; Paramount would also distribute a handful of cartoons from Rembrandt Films, most notably a series of shorts featuring the character &quot;Nudnik&quot;, created by Gene Deitch.

Kneitel&#x27;s death in 1964 brought sudden changes to the studio as Paramount now had to look for new artists. Cartoonist Howard Post was initially placed as the studio&#x27;s primary director, and would create the &quot;Honey Halfwitch&quot;. However, Post&#x27;s tenure was not successful, and even brought the ire of Paramount&#x27;s board of directors with the cartoon &quot;Two By Two&quot; (1966), a lampoon of Noah&#x27;s Ark that not only included a clone of Warner&#x27;s Daffy Duck, but was also accused of having anti-religious overtones. Post was replaced by James Culhane in late-1965, who wanted to diversify the content the studio made at the time, but he too also left in 1967 due to growing conflicts with studio higher ups. Ex-Terrytoons animator Ralph Bakshi succeeded Culhane that year, and quickly put several shorts into production. But by that point, Paramount&#x27;s new owners at the time, Gulf+Western, began the process to shutdown the cartoon studio. The shutdown was completed by December.

=== Warner Bros. ===
====Harman-Ising era====
In 1929, former Disney animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising made a cartoon entitled &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot;, and tried to sell it to a distributor in 1930. Warner Bros. who had previously tried an unsuccessful attempt to set up a cartoon studio in New York in order to compete with Disney, agreed to distribute the series. Under producer Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s guidance, Harman-Ising Productions created &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; (the title being variation on Disney&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;) starring their character Bosko. A second Harman-Ising series, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, followed in 1931. Both series showed the strong influence of the early Disney movies.

====Harman-Ising break away====
After disputes over money, Harman-Ising parted ways with Schlesinger (who rejected their demands for raised budgets) in 1933, taking &quot;Bosko&quot; with them to work with Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Schlesinger began his own cartoon operation under the new name Leon Schlesinger Productions. Animators Tom Palmer and Earl Duvall were assigned as directors, with Palmer creating a Bosko clone known as &quot;Buddy&quot;, meanwhile Schlesinger answered to Walt Disney&#x27;s use of color in the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; cartoons in 1934, and began making all future &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons in color. However, since Walt Disney had an exclusive deal with Technicolor, Schlesinger was forced to use Cinecolor and Two Strip Technicolor until 1935 when Disney&#x27;s contract with Technicolor had expired. 

The new studio had a rocky start as &quot;Buddy&quot; failed to be a successful replacement to &quot;Bosko&quot; due to his bland personality. Tom Palmer&#x27;s inexperience as a director resulted in him being terminated by Schlesinger. Duvall was also later fired following a drunked confrontation. Schlesinger then decided to re-hire several Harman-Ising animators (including Friz Freleng) to run the studio instead. Buddy would later be phased out by 1935.

====Creation of new stars====
Friz Freleng&#x27;s 1935 cartoon &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot; was the first screen appearance of Porky Pig. That same year, Schlesinger hired a new animation director who proceeded to revitalize the studio: Tex Avery. Schlesinger put Avery in charge of the low-budget &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in a low run-down old building the animators named Termite Terrace. Under Avery, Porky Pig would replace the &quot;Buddy&quot; series and become the first Warner Bros. cartoon character to achieve star power. Also at Termite Terrace, animator Bob Clampett redesigned Porky from a fat, chubby pig to a more cute and childlike character.

Unlike the other cartoon producers at the time, Avery had no intention of competing with Walt Disney, but instead brought a new wacky, zany style of animation to the studio that would increase the Warner Bros. cartoons&#x27; popularity in the crowded marketplace. This was firmly established in 1937 when Tex Avery directed &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;. During production of the short, lead animator Bob Clampett elaborated the exit of the Duck character by having him jump up and down on his head, flip around and holler off into the sunset. This created the character of Daffy Duck. After Daffy was created, he would add even more success to Warner Bros. cartoons and replaced Porky Pig as the studio&#x27;s most popular animated character. The high demand for more cartoons resulted in Schlesinger subcontracting Ub Iwerks to make some shorts with his own animation unit, with Clampett and Chuck Jones being brought in to assist. Iwerks directed only direct two shorts before he was succeeded by Clampett.

Freleng briefly left Warner Bros. for two years in 1938 when he was lured to a newly formed animation studio by MGM. In the meantime his replacements, writer Ben Hardaway and animator Cal Dalton, would create a rabbit character who would first appear in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot; (1938). The character, having the personality similar to Daffy, would become the basis of development for Warner Bros. biggest star, Bugs Bunny. Bugs made his official debut in the Avery&#x27;s 1940 Academy Award-nominated cartoon &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, that also being pairing with Elmer Fudd (also created by Avery in preliminary form three years prior). Bugs quickly replaced Daffy as the studio&#x27;s top star. By 1942, Bugs had become the most popular cartoon character. Because of the success of Bugs, Daffy and Porky, the Schlesinger studio now had risen to new heights, and Bugs quickly became the star of the color &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons, which had previously been used for one-shot character appearances. Avery would leave Warner Bros. in 1941 and moved to MGM after having feuds with Scheshinger in regard to the ending of &quot;The Heckling Hare&quot; and the rejection for an idea of a short series of live action animals with animated mouths (which he later sold to Paramount Pictures to create the &quot;Speaking with Animals&quot; series of shorts). Clampett would take over Avery&#x27;s unit while Norman McCabe took over Clampett&#x27;s black-and-white unit. By 1942, Warners&#x27; shorts had now surpassed Disney&#x27;s in sales and popularity. 

Frank Tashlin also worked with Avery in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; department. He began at Warner in 1933 as an animator but was fired and joined Iwerks in 1934. Tashlin returned to Warners in 1936, taking over direction of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; department, but left again in 1938, with his position soon taken by Chuck Jones. He returned in 1943 after McCabe was drafted into the army, but left again for the final time in late 1944 to direct live-action films. Robert McKimson, who had an extensive career at the studio up to that point, was appointed to director to replace Tashlin.

====Warner Bros. Cartoons====
Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in August 1944, and Edward Selzer was in turn named the new producer. By this time, Warner cartoons&#x27; top directors of the 1940s were Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett and Robert McKimson. Their cartoons are now considered classics of the medium. They directed some of the most beloved animated shorts of all time, including (for Clampett) &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot;, &quot;Wabbit Twouble&quot;, &quot;A Corny Concerto&quot;, &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot;, &quot;The Big Snooze&quot;, (for Freleng) &quot;You Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;, &quot;Rhapsody in Rivets&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Birds Anonymous&quot;, &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot;, (for Jones) &quot;Rabbit Fire&quot;, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;, &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;, (for McKimson) &quot;Walky Talky Hawky&quot;, &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot;, &quot;Devil May Hare&quot;, &quot;The Hole Idea&quot; and &quot;Stupor Duck&quot;.

Besides McKimson being promoted to director in the mid-1940s, Arthur Davis took over Clampett&#x27;s unit in mid-1945 after abruptly leaving the studio. Clampett went to work on &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. Many of the studios most well known recurring characters would be created or reestablished following the Warner acquisition. This included Tweety (1942), Pepé Le Pew (1945), Sylvester the Cat (1945), Yosemite Sam (1945), Foghorn Leghorn (1946), The Goofy Gophers (1947), Marvin the Martian (1948), Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner (1949), Granny (1950), Speedy Gonzales (1953), The Tasmanian Devil (1954), among others. Davis&#x27; unit was shut down in late 1947 by Warner&#x27;s due to budget issues, causing him to move to Freleng&#x27;s unit to become one of his key animators.

In 1948, Warners could no longer force theaters to buy their movies and shorts together as packages, due to the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; anti-trust case that year. It resulted in the shorts having to be produced in increasingly tighter budgets as time went on. Warner Bros. would also close their entire animation department in 1953 due to immense popularity of 3D film&#x27;s, but would reopen the following year after the end of the 3-D craze. Selzer retired in 1958, with production manager John W. Burton taking his place. David DePatie assumed the role as producer in 1960 after Burton also left the studio.

====DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts====

After more than two decades at the top, Warner Bros. shut down the original Termite Terrace studio in 1963. That same year, Freleng and DePatie would form their own studio, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which assumed production of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; following an agreement with Warner Bros. Most of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters were retired from theatres during this time, including Warner&#x27;s biggest star, Bugs Bunny. Daffy Duck, however, would still appear in theatrical cartoons, mostly paired with Speedy Gonzales.

14 original Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons were also commissioned, 11 of which were outsourced to Format Films as DePatie-Freleng was swamped with work as they were also contracted to produce &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; cartoons for United Artists. These cartoons, directed by former Chuck Jones animator Rudy Larriva and nicknamed &quot;The Larriva Eleven&quot;, were not well received and were criticized for there inability to recapture the spirit and charm of Jones&#x27; original cartoons.

After DePatie-Freleng ceased production of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in 1967, William L. Hendricks was put in charge of production of the newly renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts animation studio and hired veterans such as Alex Lovy and LaVerne Harding from the Walter Lantz studio; Volus Jones and Ed Solomon from Disney; Jaime Diaz, who later worked on &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; as director; and David Hanan, who previously worked on &quot;Roger Ramjet&quot;. Hendricks brought only three of the original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; veterans to the studio; Ted Bonniscken, Norman McCabe and Robert Givens. Under Hendricks and Lovy, the studio&#x27;s continued making Daffy-Speedy cartoons and created new characters such as &quot;Cool Cat&quot; and &quot;Merlin the Magic Mouse&quot;. Despite this, the cartoons of this era were critically panned and are widely considered to be the worst in the studio&#x27;s history (despite &quot;Norman Normal&quot; gaining a large cult following). 

Lovy left the studio in 1968 and Robert McKimson was brought back to take over. McKimson used the pre-1967 characters only in bumpers for &quot;The Bugs Bunny-Road Runner Show&quot; and in advertisements; otherwise, he mostly focused on the recurring characters Alex Lovy had created and two of his own creation, &quot;Bunny and Claude&quot;. The last of the original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts produced was &quot;Bugged by a Bee&quot; (1969) and the last &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short was &quot;Injun Trouble&quot; (1969), which shares its name with another &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short from 1938. The Warner Bros.-Seven Arts studio finally shut down in 1969. A total of 1,039 Looney Tunes shorts had been created.

A decade later, after the success of the film, &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot;, which consisted predominantly of footage from the classic shorts by Jones, a new in-house studio to produce original animation opened its doors in 1980 named Warner Bros. Animation, which exists to this day.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
====Ub Iwerks&#x27; Cartoons====
At first, Mickey Mouse was drawn by Walt Disney&#x27;s long-time partner and friend Ub Iwerks, who was also a technical innovator in cartoons, and drew an average of 600 drawings for Disney on a daily basis; Disney was responsible for the ideas in the cartoons, and Iwerks was responsible for bringing them to life. However, Iwerks left the Disney studio in 1930 to form his own company, which was financially backed by Celebrity Pictures owner Pat Powers. After his departure, Disney eventually found a number of different animators to replace Iwerks. 

Iwerks would produce two cartoon series during the 1930s: &quot;Flip the Frog&quot; and &quot;Willie Whopper&quot;. However, none of these cartoons could come close to matching the success of Disney or Fleischer cartoons, and in 1933, MGM, Iwerks&#x27; cartoon distributor since 1930, ended distribution of his cartoons, with Iwerks leaving after his contract expired in 1934. 

==== Harman-Ising and MGM Cartoons&#x27; Establishment ====
After MGM dropped Iwerks, they hired Harman and Ising following there split from Leon Schlesinger and Warner Bros and appointed them heads of the studio. They began producing &quot;Bosko&quot; and &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; cartoons which were emulative of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;. Harman and Ising gained success with shorts such as &quot;The Calico Dragon&quot; (1935), &quot;The Old Mill Pond&quot; (1936, both nominated for Academy Awards) and &quot;To Spring&quot; (1936). But much like there time at Warner Bros., the duo experienced cost overruns on a regular basis. By 1937, MGM, in attempt to make cheaper cartoons, decided to out the duo and establish a new in-house animation studio with Fred Quimby as producer. 

With a new studio formed, Quimby kept a number of Harman and Ising&#x27;s staff and scouted other animation studios for talent (including Warner director Friz Freleng and a bulk of animators from the Terrytoons studio). The first series he produced was an animated adaptation of the comic book series &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; (then retitled as &quot;The Captain &amp; The Kids&quot; in 1918). &quot;The Captain and The Kids&quot; series was unsuccessful. In 1939, however, Quimby gained success after rehiring Harman &amp; Ising. After returning to MGM, Ising created MGM&#x27;s first successful animated star named &quot;Barney Bear&quot;, who first appeared in &quot;The Bear That Couldn&#x27;t Sleep&quot; (1939). Harman directed his masterpiece &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; (1939) in the meantime, and was also nominated for an Oscar. 

====Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Tom and Jerry====
In 1939, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera started a partnership that would last for more than six decades until Hanna&#x27;s death in 2001. The duo&#x27;s first cartoon together was &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot; (1940), featuring an unnamed mouse&#x27;s attempts to outwit a house cat named Jasper. Though released without fanfare, the short was financially and critically successful, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) of 1940. On the strength of the Oscar nomination and public demand, Hanna and Barbera set themselves to producing a long-running series of cat-and-mouse cartoons, soon christening the characters &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;. &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot; did not win the 1940 Academy Award for Best Cartoon, but another MGM cartoon, Rudolf Ising&#x27;s &quot;The Milky Way&quot; (1940) did, making MGM the first studio to wrestle the Cartoon Academy Award away from Walt Disney. 

After appearing in &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Tom and Jerry quickly became the stars of MGM cartoons. With Hanna-Barbera under their belts, MGM was finally able to compete with Walt Disney in the field of animated cartoons. The shorts were successful at the box office, many licensed products (comic books, toys, etc.) were released to the market, and the series would earn twelve more Academy Award for Short Subjects (Cartoons) nominations, with seven of the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts going on to win the Academy Award: &quot;The Yankee Doodle Mouse&quot; (1943), &quot;Mouse Trouble&quot; (1944), &quot;Quiet Please!&quot; (1945), &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; (1946), &quot;The Little Orphan&quot; (1948), &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot; (1951), and &quot;Johann Mouse&quot; (1952). &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was eventually tied with &quot;Disney&#x27;s Silly Symphonies&quot; as the most-awarded theatrical cartoon series. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. In addition to classical Tom and Jerry shorts, Hanna and Barbera also produced/directed six &quot;one-shot theatrical shorts&quot; besides it, including &quot;Gallopin&#x27; Gals&quot; (1940), &quot;Officer Pooch&quot; (1941), &quot;War Dogs&quot; (1943) and &quot;Good Will to Men&quot; (a remake of Peace on Earth, 1955). 

Key to the successes of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and other MGM cartoons was the work of Scott Bradley, who scored nearly all of the cartoons for the studio from 1934 to 1958. Bradley&#x27;s scores made use of both classical and jazz sensibilities. In addition, he often used songs from the scores of MGM&#x27;s feature films, the most frequent of them being &quot;The Trolley Song&quot; from &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944) and &quot;Sing Before Breakfast&quot; from &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot; (1935).

====Tex Avery&#x27;s Cartoons====
Hugh Harman would leave for the final time in April 1941, prompting Quimby to search for a replacement. He later hired Tex Avery in September, who at that point had previously left Warner Bros. after internal feuds with Leon Schlesinger. Avery revitalized their cartoon studio with the same spark that had infused the Warner animators. His wild surreal masterpieces of his MGM studio days set new standards for &quot;adult&quot; entertainment in Code-era cartoons, most famously exemplified in his series of shorts featuring &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood.&quot;

Tex Avery did not like to use recurring characters but did stay faithful to a character throughout his career at MGM with &quot;Droopy&quot;, who was created in &quot;Dumb-Hounded&quot; in 1943. Avery also created &quot;Screwy Squirrel&quot; the following year, a character known for his outrageously brash and erratic personality who torments his adversaries, but he grew less fond of him and discontinued the series after five cartoons. He also created the inspired Of Mice and Men duo &quot;George and Junior&quot; in 1946, but only four cartoons were produced. Avery&#x27;s other recognizable films for MGM include &quot;Blitz Wolf&quot; (1942, also nominated), &quot;Northwest Hounded Police&quot; (1946), &quot;King-Size Canary&quot; (1947), &quot;The Cat That Hated People&quot; (1948) &quot;Bad Luck Blackie&quot; (1949), and &quot;Magical Maestro&quot; (1952).

Avery&#x27;s influence was particularly felt within the studio, with Hanna and Barbera adapting his brand of humor and violence into there &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; shorts. The only exception of this being Rudolf Ising, who was unable to adjust to Avery&#x27;s style and instead continued to direct cartoons with more meticulous influences. He too would later leave MGM in 1943 to work for the Army Air Force film unit as an animation supervisor.

==== Other developments and later years ====
After Ising left MGM, Hanna/Barbera animator George Gordon was promoted to director to take his place. He directed several &quot;Barney Bear&quot; shorts as well as a few other cartoons such as &quot;The Storks Holiday,&quot; and two shorts starring an unnamed donkey. Gordon was left uncredited for most of the cartoons he directed, and he would leave in 1943. Later in late 1946, animators Michael Lah and Preston Blair were paired together to direct three more &quot;Barney Bear &quot;cartoons. Lah and Blair&#x27;s three Barney cartoons were noted for having a direction more in tone to that of Hanna-Barbera and Tex Avery, but the series halted abruptly again when MGM closed Lah and Blair&#x27;s unit. 

Later in 1950, Tex Avery briefly left MGM to take a year&#x27;s sabbatical. Ex-Disney/Lantz animator Dick Lundy was brought in to take Avery&#x27;s position during this time period. He would direct one Droopy cartoon, &quot;Caballero Droop&quot;y, as well as ten additional Barney Bear cartoons, where he is now voiced by Paul Frees. Avery later returned in October 1951, with Lundy leaving soon after.

In 1953, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer closed down the Avery&#x27;s unit. Avery and most of his unit would move to Walter Lantz Productions, while MGM later promoted Lah to director again to take Avery&#x27;s place. Fred Quimby retired in 1955, with Hanna and Barbera replacing him as producers or the remaining MGM cartoons (including the last seven of Lah&#x27;s &quot;Droopy&quot; cartoons) until 1957, when the studio closed entirely, ending all the animation productions. The duo would eventually found their own studio, Hanna-Barbera that year, bringing in most of the studios staff in the process. The last MGM Cartoon, &quot;Tot Watchers&quot;, was released on August 1, 1958.

==== Rembrandt Films and MGM Animation/Visual Arts ====

By 1960, the high demand for more &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons prompted MGM to search for another animation studio to produce the series, as Hanna and Barbera were now busy producing their own cartoons for television and Columbia Pictures. Through the help of MGM president Joe Vogel, the studio eventually signed a deal with the Czechoslovakian-based animation studio Rembrandt Films to produce 13 more &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts. Gene Deitch, an American animator who considered himself a &quot;UPA man&quot; and whose opinion was infavorable to slapstick-based cartoons, would direct the series, while William L. Snyder served as the producer. Unlike the in-house cartoons, Deitch had to work with a much smaller budget of $10,000 and overall limited resources. This resulted in his films having an odd surrealist nature, which Deitch did not intend. His Tom and Jerry shorts were noted for their jerky, occasionally praiseworthy animation, simplistic yet stylish backgrounds, and heavy use of reverb in the soundtrack. Another aspect to this era was the addition of a new human owner for Tom who appeared in 3 of the 13 shorts; he is noted for being much more short-tempered and violent then any of Tom&#x27;s previous owners. 

Despite Deitch&#x27;s shorts being commercially successful, fans and critics considered them to be the worst of &quot;Tom and Jerry&#x27;s&quot; output up to that time. However some fans appreciated Deitch&#x27;s shorts for their quirkiness. After Vogel was fired, MGM decided not to renew their contract with Rembrandt. The last Rembrandt &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon, &quot;Carmen Get It&quot;, was released on December 21, 1962.

Meanwhile, Chuck Jones started his own studio Sib Tower 12 Productions after he, and his unit of animators, were fired by Warner Bros. for violating his exclusive contract by working on the UPA film &quot;Gay Purr-ee&quot;. Jones signed a contract with MGM in 1963 to produce an additional 34 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, all of which carried his distinct style and influence he strived for during his time at Warners. Jones&#x27; &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts were more reminiscent to his &quot;Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner&quot; cartoons due to its use of blackout gags and specific jokes that can be found in the former shorts. MGM later purchased the studio and renamed it to &quot;MGM Animation/Visual Arts&quot; in 1964. Around this time Jones also directed a handful of oneshots for MGM such as 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; and 1967&#x27;s &quot;The Bear That Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, the former of which won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Jones&#x27; shorts were better received and saw varying degrees of success, but MGM eventually decided to cease production of new &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts in 1967.

Jones&#x27; studios other works included the 1966 TV adaptation of Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; and the feature-length film &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; that same year. The studio would eventually close in late 1970, with Jones establishing another studio, &quot;Chuck Jones Enterprises&quot;, soon afterwards.

===Columbia Pictures===
====Charles Mintz and Screen Gems====
===== Initial Years and Color Rhapsodies =====
While Charles Mintz was fired from Paramount &amp; Universal, he was still in charge of his own cartoon operation producing &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; cartoons for Columbia Pictures. After creating &quot;Toby the Pup&quot; for RKO Pictures, who later discontinued it in favor of Van Beuren Studios, he soon moved to create more shorts for Columbia, his most notable series was one featuring a boy named &quot;Scrappy&quot;, created by Dick Huemer in 1931. Despite Scrappy was a big break for Mintz and was also his most successful creation, Huemer would be fired from the Mintz Studio in 1933. In 1934, Mintz, like most other animation studios at the time, also attempted to answer Disney&#x27;s use of Technicolor, and began making color cartoons through the &quot;Color Rhapsodies&quot; series; the series was originally in either Cinecolor or two-strip Technicolor, but moved to three-strip Technicolor after Disney&#x27;s contract with Technicolor expired in 1935.

With the exception of &quot;Holiday Land&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot; (1937, both of which were nominated for an Academy Award), the series failed to garner attention, and by 1939, Mintz was largely indebted to Columbia Pictures. As a result, Mintz sold his studio to Columbia. Columbia renamed the studio to Screen Gems; and Mintz died by the end of the year. Columbia would also sub-contract Ub Iwerks to produce cartoons from his own studio from 1937 until 1940.

===== Change of management and decline =====
Charles&#x27; brother-in-law George Winkler would briefly presume the role as producer before he was succeeded by Frank Tashlin, who initially worked as a storyman. Tashlin had significant influence to the studio as he would hire a surplus of ex-Disney animators from the 1941 Disney animators&#x27; strike, laid off most of their initial in-house staff, and directed the short &quot;The Fox and the Grapes&quot; (1941)&quot;,&quot; which inadvertently created the studio&#x27;s most popular characters&quot;, The Fox and the Crow&quot;. 

Tashlin maintained his position until he was replaced by Ben Schwalb in 1942. He would continue to act as the studio supervisor until he left abruptly in June, citing a feud with Columbia hire-ups. Tashlin and Schwalb were then replaced by Dave Fleischer, who was reportedly much more detached from his animators. He who would also later be fired and replaced by a revolving door of producers. Critics and animation historians noted the quality of the studio&#x27;s output had either stagnated or declined as Screen Gems was unable to rebound from its loss of Tashlin. It was argued that Columbia&#x27;s mismanagement and its inability to find skillful writers and directors were key factors of the decline. Michael Barrier described their work at the time as &quot;imitation Warner Bros.&quot; 

The other recurring characters Columbia would develop at this time included &quot;Willoughby Wren, Flippy and Flop, Igor Puzzlewitz, Professor Small and Mr. Tall, Tito and his Burrito&quot; and an adaptation of Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner,&quot; of which Capp was not pleased by due to its over-simplification of his characters. Columbia remained dissatisfied by the studio&#x27;s output and eventually closed it in 1946, with a back catalog that lasted until 1949. The &quot;Screen Gems&quot; name would later be used for a TV subsidiary the same year.

====United Productions of America====
===== Early productions =====
John Hubley was one of many ex-Disney staffers who were hired by Tashlin to work at the Screen Gems studio, initially working as a writer and later a director with Paul Sommer. While Hubley later admitted to disliking his work for Screen Gems, he had much creative freedom due to Dave Fleischer&#x27;s detachment from the employees. The cartoons Hubley and Sommer directed were noted for its greater use of human characters, minimalistic backgrounds and abstract character designs. Much of it was inspired by limited animation techniques Chuck Jones established for his cartoon &quot;The Dover Boys&quot;, with Hubley and Sommer even going as far as directing a &quot;clone&quot; with the cartoon &quot;The Rocky Road to Ruin.&quot;

Hubley left Screen Gems in 1943 after he was enlisted in the United States Armed Forces. At the same time, he would help establish a new studio with former Disney animators Stephen Bosustow, Zack Schwartz and David Hilberman, who—like Hubley—had left Walt&#x27;s nest during the animator&#x27;s strike. It was a newer, smaller animation studio that focused on pursuing Hubley&#x27;s own vision of trying out newer, more abstract and experimental styles of animation. Bosustow, Hilberman, and Schwartz named the new studio as Industrial Film and Poster Service, or IFPS. Artistically, the studio also used &quot;limited animation&quot; as its main artstyle. The first short from the newly formed studio was &quot;Sparks and Chips Get the Blitz&quot; (1943). There second short was &quot;Hell-Bent for Election&quot; (1944), a cartoon made for the re-election campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although these new films was a success, it did not break the boundaries that Hubley and his staffers had hoped. It wasn&#x27;t until the third short, Robert Cannon&#x27;s &quot;Brotherhood of Man&quot;, that the studio began producing shorts aggressively stylized in contrast to the films of the other studios. Cannon&#x27;s film even preached a message that, at the time, was looked down upon—racial tolerance. By 1946, the studio was renamed as United Productions of America (UPA), and Hilberman and Schwartz had sold their shares of the studio stock to Bosustow.

===== Success under Columbia =====
In 1948, UPA also found a home for itself at Columbia Pictures and began producing theatrical cartoons for the general public, instead of just using propaganda and military training themes; UPA also earned itself two Academy Award nominations for new cartoons starring &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; during its first two years in production. Unlike with Screen Gems, Columbia was much more hands-off in terms of management. From there, the UPA animators began producing a series of cartoons that immediately stood out among the crowded field of mirror-image, copycat cartoons of the other studios. The success of UPA&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; series made all of the other studios sit up and take notice, and when the UPA short &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; (1950) won an Oscar, the effect on Hollywood was immediate and electrifying. The UPA style was markedly different from everything else being seen on movie screens, and audiences responded to the change that UPA offered from the repetition of usual cat-mouse battles. Mr Magoo would go on to be the studio&#x27;s most successful cartoon character. 

By 1953, UPA had gained great influence within the industry. The Hollywood cartoon studios gradually moved away from the lush, realistic detail of the 1940s to a more simplistic, less realistic style of animation. By this time, even Disney was attempting to mimic UPA. 1953&#x27;s shorts &quot;Melody&quot; and &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot; in particular were experiments in stylization that followed in the footsteps of the newly formed studio. However, UPA would suffer a major blow after John Hubley was fired from the studio during the McCarthy Era in 1952, due to suspicions of him having ties to Communism; Steve Bosustow took over, but was not as successful as Hubley, and the studio was eventually sold to Henry Saperstein in 1960.

Around 1952, Eric Porter, an Australian filmmaker and animator, proposed two cartoons to Columbia featuring his character &quot;Bimbo&quot;. These were rejected and both cartoons are currently in the public domain.

===== Feature-length films and decline =====
In 1959, UPA released &quot;1001 Arabian Nights&quot; starring Mr Magoo, however, this was proved to be a failure, as this cost UPA their distribution deal with Columbia Pictures. they tried once more in 1962, UPA released &quot;Gay Purr-ee&quot; with the voice talents of Judy Garland, this time, with a distributor in Warner Bros. While the film was well received, it too was a financial failure. In 1964, UPA decided to abandon animation and simply become a distribution company, where they would go on to distribute some of the &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies to America.

====Hanna-Barbera====

Prior to UPA&#x27;s termination, Columbia struck a 10-year distribution deal with Hanna-Barbera, which had just left the freshly shut down Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoon Studio. This deal would mostly be involved with Columbia&#x27;s TV division, Screen Gems, which ironically borrowed the name from the animation studio. In 1959, Hanna-Barbera produced the only theatrical series for Columbia, &quot;Loopy De Loop&quot;. This series was a success, and ran until 1965. Hanna-Barbera also produced 2 movies for Columbia, which was &quot;Hey There, It&#x27;s Yogi Bear!&quot; and &quot;The Man Called Flintstone&quot;. Columbia&#x27;s 10-year contract with Hanna-Barbera expired in 1967, and was not renewed, thus ending Columbia&#x27;s association with Hanna-Barbera in every way.

===Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions===
====Early Developments====
In 1928, Walter Lantz replaced Charles Mintz as producer of Universal Studios cartoons. Walter Lantz&#x27;s main character at this time was &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;, whose earlier cartoons had been produced by both Walt Disney and Charles Mintz. Lantz also started to experiment with color cartoons, and the first one, called Jolly Little Elves, was released in 1934. In 1935, Walter Lantz made his studio independent from Universal Studios, and the studio was now only the distributors of his cartoons, instead of the direct owners. After seeing Disney&#x27;s success of their first film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, Lantz planned to produce a full-length animated film based on the story &quot;Aladdin&quot;, starring the famous comedy duo Abbot and Costello. However, the project was not developed after &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; bombed at the box office.

====New Stars and United Artists====
By the late 30s, Oswald began to lose popularity. Lantz and his staff worked on several ideas for possible new cartoon characters (among them &quot;Meany, Miny, and Moe&quot;, &quot;Lil&#x27; Eightball&quot; and &quot;Baby-Face Mouse&quot;). The studio eventually settled on &quot;Andy Panda&quot;, who gained popularlity in his debut short &quot;Life Begins for Andy Panda&quot; (1939). However successful Andy was, it was not until the character&#x27;s fifth cartoon, &quot;Knock Knock&quot; (1940), that a real breakthrough character was introduced. &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;, who initially appeared in an &quot;Andy Panda&quot; cartoon, who become Lantz&#x27;s most successful creation.

By the early 1940s, Lantz and animator Alex Lovy directed cartoons through the use of singular unit until 1943, when James Culhane (an ex-Disney/Fleischer animator who recently had a brief stint at Warner Bros.) took their roles as director, starting with the cartoon &quot;Pass the Biscuits Mirandy!&quot; (1943). Culhane&#x27;s tenure at Lantz was noted for introducing Russian avant-garde influenced experimentation, minimalist backgrounds and fast cutting, which helped his shorts stand out from the studios previous work. Lantz would also introduce a new film series under the name &quot;Swing Symphony&quot;, which were musical shorts based around contemporary swing music at the time. Culhane later left Lantz in late-1945 following a pay dispute. Ex-Disney animator Dick Lundy assumed the role as director after Culhane&#x27;s departure. Unlike Culhane, Lundy focused much more on sight gags and the animation. Critics noted the animations jump in quality in the late 40&#x27;s, mainly due to Lundy&#x27;s influence as well as the arrival of more Ex-Disney animations, such as Ed Love, Fred Moore and Ken O&#x27;Brien. 

In 1947, Lantz was negotiating with Universal about his 7-year contract when it was abruptly transformed into Universal-International. The new management insisted on keeping the merchandising and licensing rights of his characters. Lantz refused, instead he withdrew from his parent company and contracted his shorts to be distributed by United Artists between 1947 and 1949. This was also the era where &quot;Andy Panda&quot; was officially discontinued due to his waning popularity. In total, 12 shorts were released under United Artists.

==== Restructuring and later years ====
Lantz&#x27; studio went through severe financial issues during its time with United Artist, which caused him to close the studio in 1949. It opened again in 1950 with a downsized staff, mainly because Lantz was able recoup from his losses and signed a deal with Universal-International for more Woody Woodpecker cartoons, starting with &quot;Puny Express&quot; (1951). Woody would continue to appear in cartoons until the early 1970s. Lantz served as the sole director and writer for his own cartoons for two years before it was assumed by animator Don Patterson and writer Homer Brightman. The studio was still able benefit from obtaining additional animators and writers throughout its second life; With MGM downsizing its animation studio and Warner Bros. briefly closing its entire animation department in the 50&#x27;s, Lantz was able to build up enough staff to the point he can establish a second unit. Paul J. Smith, a Warner Bros. veteran who worked for Lantz in the 40&#x27;s, would be the director for this new unit.

Smith would create &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; in 1953, who would become another prominent character for the Lantz studio. He would later be refined by Tex Avery in the following year, who left MGM earlier that decade. Avery would direct 4 shorts during his time at Walter Lantz Productions, until he left in 1955 over pay disputes. Additional directional contributions included, Jack Hannah, Sid Marcus and Alex Lovy, who returned to the studio since the early 40s. The Lantz studio would also make several more recurring characters in this era, such as &quot;Maw and Paw, Maggie &amp; Sam, Windy &amp; Breezy, Inspector Willoughby, Hickory, Dickory, and Doc,&quot; and &quot;The Beary Family.&quot;

Lantz eventually closed his studio&#x27;s doors for the final time in 1972, saying that continuing to produce shorts would be impossible due to the rising production costs. However, for Lantz, Woody Woodpecker&#x27;s survival was lengthened when he started appearing in &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; from 1957 to 1987, from which it entered syndication until 1990. NBC revived the show three times—in 1991, 1992, and 1997, Lantz sold all of the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; shorts to Universal, then part of MCA.

===Terrytoons===
==== Pre-Terrytoons era ====
Before Paul Terry created his own studio, he was employed by Bray Productions in 1916, where he created his recognizable character, &quot;Farmer Al Falfa&quot;. Later in 1921, he worked at Fables Pictures, Inc, founded by Keith-Albee-Orpheum and soon purchased by Amedee J. Van Beuren in 1928. There he would work on the &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot; cartoon series. Van Beuren however became anxious due to the phenomenon of a new film format of pre-synchronized sound in film. Beuren urged Terry to produce films in this format, but refused, forcing him to fire Terry in 1929. 

====Formation and financial backing====
After losing his &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot; series to Van Beuren Studios in 1929, Terry established a new studio called Terrytoons. Terrytoons produced 26 cartoons a year for E.W. Hammons&#x27; Educational Pictures, which in turn supplied short-subject products to the Fox Film Corporation. When the studio was later reformed into 20th Century Fox in 1935, the studio withdrew support of Educational Pictures and financially backed Terry&#x27;s studio instead. Educational Pictures would eventually fold in the late 30&#x27;s. Terry&#x27;s cartoons of the 1930s were mainly produced black-and-white and has very few recurring characters, with the exception of &quot;Farmer Al Falfa&quot;, who continued appearing in Terry&#x27;s cartoons since the silent era. 

The 1930s and 1940s brought Terry&#x27;s most popular and successful characters, &quot;Gandy Goose&quot; beginning in 1938, &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; beginning in 1942, and &quot;Heckle and Jeckle&quot;, developed by combining what was originally a husband-and-wife pair of mischievous magpies from the 1946 &quot;Farmer Al Falfa&quot; cartoon &quot;The Talking Magpies&quot; with Terry&#x27;s notion that twin brothers or look-alikes had comedic possibilities. Other characters include &quot;Dinky Duck&quot; in 1939, &quot;Dimwit the Dog&quot; (originally paired with Heckle and Jeckle), &quot;Sourpuss&quot; (usually paired with Gandy Goose) and among others. Terrytoons was also nominated three times for the Academy Award for Bests Animated Short Film: &quot;All Out for V&quot; (1942), &quot;My Boy, Johnny&quot; (1944), &quot;Mighty Mouse in Gypsy Life&quot; (1945)&quot;.&quot; 

Despite its success, the Terrytoon cartoon&#x27;s were known for having the smallest budgets of any major animation studio at the time, as well as being the slowest to adapt to new animation standards. Paul Terry mainly produced cartoons from a business point of view rather than their artistic value; he would also go on to say, &quot;Let Walt Disney be the Tiffany&#x27;s of the business. I want to be the Woolworth&#x27;s!&quot; However, Terrytoons is considered an early stepping stone for several prominent animators, such as Joseph Barbera, and Art Babbitt.

====The CBS era====
Terry retired after selling his company and its backlog to CBS in 1956. CBS continued to operate the studio for the rest of its lifetime, with Gene Deitch now in charge as a creative director. Terrytoons underwent significant changes under Deitch&#x27;s leadership. Unlike Terry, Deitch wanted to strip away the studios from its strict contemporary format, and instead produce cartoons in a more minimalist style similar to UPA. Terrytoons was also divided between producing theatrical short and cartoons for television, as well as having new characters such as &quot;Tom Terrific, Lariat Sam, Sidney the Elephant, Gaston Le Crayon, John Doormat&quot;, and &quot;Clint Clobber&quot; (often confused as Tom&#x27;s human owner in Deitch&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;). He had also discontinued the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;Heckle and Jeckle&quot; cartoons so that focus could be put more on his new characters. The &quot;Sidney&quot; cartoon, &quot;Sidney&#x27;s Family Tree&quot; (1958), would also earn Terrytoons another Academy Award nomination.

Deitch was later fired in 1959 by executive producer William M. Weiss, who reverted a few of Deitch&#x27;s decision&#x27;s. &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;Heckle and Jeckle&quot; would continue production for some time, alongside the creation of new characters, such as &quot;Hector Heathcote&quot;, &quot;Luno the White Stallion&quot;, &quot;Hashimoto-san&quot;, &quot;Sad Cat&quot; and &quot;Deputy Dawg.&quot; Animator Ralph Bakshi would also gain prominence around this time, originally starting out as an opaquer and later a director. Bakshi would later move to Famous Studios in 1967. Terrytoons would continue operations until the studio fizzled out and closed in 1972.

== Other Known Animation Studios ==

===Van Beuren Studios===
In 1928, producer Amadee J. Van Beuren bought Keith-Albee-Orpheum&#x27;s Fables Pictures Studio and formed a partnership with Paul Terry for the production of the &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot; cartoon series. In 1929, Terry left to start his own studio and was replaced by John Foster who took over the animation department, and renamed the studio Van Beuren Studios. Van Beuren continued the &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; series, created new characters such as &quot;Cubby Bear&quot;, and unsuccessfully tried a cartoon adaptation of radio blackface comedians &quot;Amos &#x27;n Andy&quot;. Other Van Beuren cartoons featured &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; (not the cat and mouse, but a &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;-like human duo,) and Otto Soglow&#x27;s comic strip character &quot;The Little King&quot;. Frank Tashlin and Joseph Barbera were among animators who worked briefly for the studio during its short life. Van Beuren would also sub-contract Harman-Ising Productions to produce a handful of &quot;Cubby Bear&quot; cartoons before they were contracted by MGM in 1934.

That same year, as other studios were putting animated cartoons in Technicolor as an answer to Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; cartoon series, Van Beuren Studio abandoned its remaining cartoons and answered Disney&#x27;s use of Technicolor by creating the &quot;Rainbow Parade&quot; series, which was all color. However, the series was not a success, and by 1936, RKO Pictures, the distributor of Van Beuren&#x27;s cartoons, ended their contract with them to distribute Disney&#x27;s cartoons instead. Van Beuren would close the studio in 1938, and pass away not long after. Most of its staff would either move to Terrytoons, Fleischer Studios or other studios in the East or West Coast. 

Van Beuren Studios, along with Fleischer Studios, were cited as causes that formed of the Screen Cartoonist&#x27;s Guild in 1938, with the former studio being noted for its poor treatment of union workers by either Van Beuren himself or director Burt Gillett. Van Beuren has said to have closed his studio as he refused to accept unionization within his business.

=== The Iwerks Studio/Cartoon Films Ltd ===

In 1930, distributor Pat Powers convinced Walt Disney animator Ub Iwerks to leave the Disney studio and create his own, believing that Iwerks was responsible for much of Disney&#x27;s early success. Iwerks opened his studio that year with Powers as his financial backer. Iwerk&#x27;s first made cartoons for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, creating characters such as &quot;Flip the Frog&quot; and &quot;Willie Whopper&quot;. MGM later ended distributing his cartoons in favor of releasing Harman and Ising&#x27;s cartoons instead.

After his stay with MGM, Iwerks&#x27; cartoons were distributed by Celebrity Pictures, and Iwerks would answer to Disney&#x27;s use of Technicolor and create the ComiColor Cartoon series, which aired cartoons in two-strip Cinecolor. However, by 1936, the Iwerks Studio began to experience financial setbacks after Powers withdrew financial aid to the studio. After animating at Warner Bros. Pictures, creating Gabby Goat and subcontracting cartoons for Columbia Pictures for some time, Iwerks returned to Disney in 1940, where he worked as the head of the &quot;special effects development&quot; division until his death in 1971.

Iwerks left behind his animation studio following his return to Disney. It would soon be reorganized as &quot;Cartoon Films Ltd&quot;, with British-based angel investor Lawson Harris becoming the studio producer and Paul Fennell the director. The studio&#x27;s main output was commercial animation, but were most known for their specialties for Columbia. One short-lived series, &quot;The Changing World&quot;, starring journalist Raymond Gram Swing, was planned to have six shorts produced and would be intended to document events before and during World War II, but was later scrapped after two shorts. Another short entitled &quot;The Carpenters&quot; (1941) was produced and featured the antics of Mr. Teewilliger and his bumbling employees Clancy and Herman. The studio would continue to produce animated commercials following their work with Columbia.

===Republic Pictures===

Following his termination from Screen Gems, Dave Fleischer approached Republic Pictures with an elf-like character named &quot;Snippy&quot;, who would first appear in the 1944 film &quot;Trocadero&quot;. He would also produce a lengthy animated sequence in &quot;That&#x27;s My Baby!&quot; that same year. Later in 1946, Republic incorporated a piece of animation by Walter Lantz Productions into there film &quot;Sioux City&quot;, a western starring Gene Autry. The next year, Republic signed a deal with ex-Warner director Bob Clampett to produce a series of shorts starring his latest creation&quot;, Charlie Horse&quot;. Clampett got to direct one cartoon with the title &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Nag&quot; (1947) before the company cancelled a potential animated series. 

Later in 1949, Republic started another cartoon series called &quot;Jerky Journeys&quot;, led by radio comedy writer Leonard L. Levinson. The cartoons were noted to use limited animation, and were described as satirical travelogue films with small budgets. Art Heinemann was the lead layout designer, Miles Pike provided the special effects and Warner artist&#x27;s Robert Gribbroek, Peter Alvarado and Paul Julian provided the background paintings. One of there shorts, &quot;The 3 Minnies Sota, Tonka &amp; Ha-Ha&quot; (1948) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Republic later discontinued the series after four cartoons were made.

=== George Pal Productions ===
George Pal was a Hungarian filmmaker who originally produced traditionally animated and puppetry shorts in Europe during the 1930s. Unlike other films that feature puppetry, Pal&#x27;s puppet shorts used a stop motion technique known as &quot;replacement animation (or the Pal-Doll technique)&quot;, which uses a series of unique carved wooden puppets for each frame to emulated movement rather than using a single puppet. Some of Pal&#x27;s earlier shorts were advertisements for specific products, such as the Philips Radio system in &quot;The Ship of the Ether&quot; (1934)&quot;, Philips Cavalcade&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1939). Pal later moved to the United States in 1939 and was contracted by Paramount to produce more stop-motion shorts under the name &quot;Madcap Models&quot;, later rebranded as &quot;Puppetoons.&quot;

Seven Puppetoon films from 1941 to 1947 were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, and the series would create several recurring characters, such as &quot;Jasper, Mr. Strauss,&quot; and &quot;Punchy &amp; Judy&quot;, as well as producing industrial animation for the Shell Oil Company. Pal was also one of the earlier filmmakers to have refraimed from using overtly negative depictions of African-Americans due to his European origin. He has since produce shorts that commemorate there culture, such as with the shorts &quot;John Henry and the Inky-Poo&quot; (1946), and &quot;Dates with Duke&quot; (1947). 

By 1947, production costs had inflated to nearly $50,000 per short, a price to which Paramount objected. Paramount suggested that Pal should shift his focus from stop-motion to live action films, to which he did, effectively ending the Puppetoons series. He would still incorporate stop-motion sequences in his films, such as in &quot;The Great Rupert&quot; (1949), &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (1963). Pal&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Destination Moon&quot; would also notably incorporate a traditionally animated sequence by Walter Lantz Productions, featuring Woody Woodpecker. The sequence was produced immediately after Walter Lantz, a close friend of Pal, reopened his studio that same year.

=== John Sutherland Productions ===
John Sutherland founded his own studio &quot;John Sutherland Productions&quot; in 1945 after working in Walt Disney Productions and the US Army with a series of World War II training films. The studio would mainly be known for producing educational/instructional based animation granted by the Harding College with the help of Alfred P. Sloan. One of their more notable films is &quot;Make Mine Freedom&quot;, a 1948 cartoon that was the first in a series of pro-free enterprise films produced by the studio. Sutherland was able to hire prominent artists in the industry such as Emery Hawkins, Phil Roman and a large bulk of ex-Harman-Ising animators to work on his cartoons. Sutherland&#x27;s studio was able to develop a relationship with MGM, who would distribute some of there shorts in the late 40s to early 50s. Sutherland would also dabble into stop-motion animation as well, such as producing the &quot;Daffy Ditty&quot; shorts with Larry Morey for United Artists. He would produce 45 films from 1945 until his retirement in 1973.

=== Jerry Fairbanks Productions ===
While not mainly involved in the medium, Jerry Fairbanks did work on several animation projects for. In 1941, Fairbanks produced the successful &quot;Speaking of Animals&quot; short films, based on an idea conceptualized by Tex Avery at Warner Bros., and resulted in it being nominated twice for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. In the late 40&#x27;s and early 50&#x27;s, Fairbanks also produced industrial based films with occasion animated sequences by Manny Gould, Lou Lilly and Anna Osborn. Fairbanks also worked on &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; as a supervising producer.

===Jay Ward Productions===

Founded in 1948 by animator Jay Ward, Jay Ward Productions aired the first cartoon made for television, &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; and is also remembered for &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; (1959–1964), as well as several iconic advertisements, such as those for breakfast cereals. Employing a limited animation style, the success of Jay Ward cartoons laid in its densely-packed visual gags and wordplay.

=== The Jam Handy Organization ===

Jam Handy, a known Olympic swimmer and water polo player, was known for founding his own Chicago-based studio, The Jam Handy Organization, after working as an industrial representative for Bray Productions. Though he is best known for producing films for the auto industry, Handy has also dabbled into animation as well. Handy has made numerous animated shorts featuring &quot;Nicky Nome&quot;, a character made to advertise the Chevrolet for General Motors.

Perhaps Handy&#x27;s best known animated short was the 1948 adaptation of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, sponsored by Montgomery Ward. It was the first known animated adaptation of the titular character and was produced and directed by Max Fleischer.

=== McCrory Studios Inc. ===
In 1926, John Robert McCrory, an author and World War I soldier turned animator, formed his own animation studio based in New York after gaining experienced from Bray Productions and Walt Disney&#x27;s Laugh-O-Gram Studio. He reached a deal with Life Magazine to produce a series of shorts featuring his character &quot;Mike the Monk&quot;, a humanoid monkey character accompanies by his girlfriend. &quot;Mike&quot; spun off into another series entitled &quot;Krazy Kids&quot;, which lasted about a year. 

Later in 1930, Leon Schlesinger was offering a contract for an animation studio to produce the then upcoming series, Looney Tunes. While animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising pitched a series based on there character Bosko, McCrory attempted to win the offer by hastily producing a cartoon featuring his newest character &quot;Buster Bear,&quot; which was originally produced as two or four separate cartoons. In the end, Schlesinger signed Harman and Ising to produce the series, as McCrory&#x27;s cartoon was not up to standard. McCrory did not quit the industry after this, as he later created a short-lived series based on Harold Gray&#x27;s &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, and gained success by redistributing his &quot;Buster Bear&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot; cartoons through toy projectors and home media. In 1938, the studio was rebranded as &quot;Knowledge Builders&quot; and continued operations into the 1960s.

=== Ted Eshbaugh Studios ===

Ted Eshbaugh, and American animator/filmmaker, initially created a Los Angeles-based animation studio in the early 1930s after experimenting with early forms of color-processing for cartoons in the late 20s. His studio was known for being an early adapter in producing colored animation with shorts such as Goofy Goat (1931, which used Multicolor) and The Snowman (1933, which used Technicolor). Eshbaugh would also produce an adaptation of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which was also planned to be a full series. The film however, was not released, due to Technicolor signing an exclusivity deal with Disney around the same time, and Baum&#x27;s son Col. Frank Baum rejecting its release due to missed deadlines.

Eshbaugh later worked at the Van Beuren Studio until 1935, where he found another studio based in New York. One of his first productions from his new studio was a satirical cartoon based on Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal entitled &quot;A Fable of the New Deal,&quot; which was made as part of a political campaign to satirize Roosevelt&#x27;s 1936 presidential campaign. It was reportedly censored after initial screenings when Sentinels found the caricatures representing Roosevelt to be too grotesque. Other early projects include a color series featuring a character named &quot;Peter Panda&quot; and a short made for Planters Nut &amp; Chocolate Co. entitled &quot;Mr. Peanut and His Family Tree&quot; for there 1939 World&#x27;s Fair exhibit. Eshbaugh also made a few shorts promoting the war effort during World War II, such as &quot;Sammy Salvage&quot; (1943) and &quot;Cap&#x27;n Cub&quot; (1945). Eshbaugh&#x27;s studio continued operations into the late-50&#x27;s.

==Trends==
===Sound in animation===
While much of the focus in an animated cartoon is on the visuals, the vocal talents and symphonic scores that accompanied the images were also very important to the animated cartoons&#x27; success. As motion pictures drew audiences away from their radio sets, it also drew talented actors and vocal impressionists into film and animation. Mel Blanc gave voice to most of Warner Bros. more popular characters, including Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig (starting in 1937), and Daffy Duck. Other voices and personalities from vaudeville and radio contributed to the popularity of animated films in the Golden Era. Some of these (generally uncredited) actors included Cliff Edwards (also known as Ukulele Ike), Arthur Q. Bryan, Stan Freberg, Bea Benaderet, Bill Thompson, Grace Stafford, Jim Backus, June Foray, and Daws Butler.

Cartoons of this era also included scores played by studio orchestras. Carl Stalling, Scott Bradley, Sammy Timberg, Winston Sharples, Darrell Calker, Clarence Wheeler, and Oliver Wallace composed numerous cartoon soundtracks, creating original material as well as incorporating familiar classical and popular melodies. Many of the early cartoons, particularly those of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series, were built around classical pieces. These cartoons sometimes featured star characters, but many had simple nature themes.

===Stop motion and special effects===
For a great part of the history of Hollywood animation, the production of animated films was an exclusive industry that did not branch off very often into other areas. The various animation studios worked almost exclusively on producing animated cartoons and animated titles for movies. Only occasionally was animation used for other aspects of the movie industry. The low-budget &quot;Superman serials&quot; of the 1940s used animated sequences of Superman flying and performing super-powered feats which were used in the place of live-action special effects, but this was not a common practice.

The exclusivity of animation also resulted in the birth of a sister industry that was used almost exclusively for motion picture special effects: stop motion animation. In spite of their similarities, the two genres of stop-motion and hand-drawn animation rarely came together during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Stop-motion animation made a name for itself with the 1933 box-office hit &quot;King Kong&quot;, where animator Willis O&#x27;Brien defined many of the major stop motion techniques used for the next 50 years. The success of &quot;King Kong&quot; led to a number of other early special effects films, including &quot;Mighty Joe Young,&quot; which was also animated by O&#x27;Brien and helped to start the careers of several animators, including Ray Harryhausen, who came into his own in the 1950s. George Pal was the only stop-motion animator to produce a series of stop-motion animated cartoons for theatrical release, the &quot;Puppetoon&quot; series for Paramount, some of which were animated by Ray Harryhausen. Pal went on to produce several live-action special effects-laden feature films.

Stop motion animation reached the height of its popularity during the 1950s. The exploding popularity of science fiction films led to an exponential development in the field of special effects, and George Pal became the producer of several popular special effects-laden films. Meanwhile, Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s work on such films as &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;, &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot; drew in large crowds and encouraged the development of &quot;realistic&quot; special effects in films. These effects used many of the same techniques as cel animation, but still the two media did not often come together. Stop motion developed to the point where Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s effects in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; seemed lifelike to an unearthly degree.

Hollywood special effects continued to develop in a manner that largely avoided cel animation, though several memorable animated sequences were included in live-action feature films of the era. The most famous of these was a scene during the movie &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, in which actor Gene Kelly danced with an animated Jerry Mouse (of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; fame). But except for occasional sequences of this sort, the only real integration of cel animation into live-action films came in the development of animated credit and title sequences. Saul Bass&#x27; opening sequences for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s films (including &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;) are highly praised, and inspired several imitators.

===The wartime era===

The major Hollywood studios contributed greatly to the war effort, and their cartoon studios pitched in as well with various contributions. At the Fleischer studios, Popeye the Sailor joined the Navy and began fighting Nazis and &quot;Japs&quot;; while the Warner Bros. studio produced a series of &quot;Private Snafu&quot; instructional film cartoons especially for viewing by enlisted soldiers. Even Disney was involved in the war effort, producing both satirical comedies such as &quot;Der Fuhrer&#x27;s Face&quot;, and commentaries such as &quot;Education for Death&quot;.

==Decline of theatrical shorts==

===DePatie–Freleng Enterprises===

The 1960s saw some creative sparks in the theatrical film medium, in particular from DePatie–Freleng Enterprises. Their first and most successful project was animating the opening titles for the 1964 film, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, starring Peter Sellers. The film and its animated sequences were so successful that United Artists commissioned the studio to produce a Pink Panther cartoon series. The first short, &quot;The Pink Phink&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1964. The studio also produced other successful cartoon series such as &quot;The Inspector&quot; and &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot;.

===MGM Animation/Visual Arts===
Meanwhile, Chuck Jones, who had been fired from Warner Bros., moved to MGM to produce thirty-four theatrical &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons in late 1963. These cartoons were animated in his distinctive style, but they never quite matched the popularity of the Hanna-Barbera originals of the 1940s and 1950s heyday. However, they were more successful than the Gene Deitch &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, which were produced overseas during 1961 and 1962.

From 1964 to 1967, DePatie–Freleng produced &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts under contract with Warner Bros. These cartoons can be recognized easily because they use the modern abstract WB logos instead of the famous bullseye WB shield concentric circles. The studio also subcontracted 11 &quot;Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner&quot; cartoons to Format Films. DePatie–Freleng ceased production of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and moved to the San Fernando Valley in 1967 to continue production of their &quot;Pink Panther&quot; cartoons producing the final original theatrical cartoon in 1977. The subsequent Pink Panther shorts 1978–1981 were originally produced for television and then released into theaters. In 1967, WB would resume production on their own cartoons, before shutting down the theatrical animated cartoon department altogether in 1969. In 1981, the studio was purchased by Marvel Comics and was renamed Marvel Productions.

===Hanna-Barbera===

In 1946, the animation union of the time negotiated a pay increase of 25%, making the cartoons more expensive to produce on a general basis. After the 1948 verdict following the Hollywood Antitrust case, there was no longer a booking guarantee on the theatres for cartoons from any of the studios, making it a more risky business and because of this less resources were invested in the theatrical shorts, causing a gradual decline. By the beginning of the 1950s, the medium of television was beginning to gain more momentum, and the animation industry began to change as a result. At the head of this change were the tandem of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, the creators of &quot;Tom and Jerry.&quot; The new Hanna-Barbera utilized the limited animation style that UPA had pioneered. With this limited animation, Hanna and Barbera created several characters including &quot;Huckleberry Hound&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. With television&#x27;s growing popularity, which included the Saturday morning cartoons, a much more significant decline began in movie-going in the 1960s. To face the competition from TV, the theaters did what they could to reduce their own costs. One way of doing so was booking features only and avoiding the expenses of shorts, which were considered unnecessary and too expensive. Those few shorts that found their way to the theaters despite this are often viewed by critics as inferior to their predecessors.

==Timeline==
This is a timeline of golden age of American animation studios&#x27; active production of regularly released animated cartoon shorts for theatrical exhibition. Some studios continue to release animated shorts to theaters on an infrequent basis. The colors correspond to the american animation studio&#x27;s associated theatrical distributor.



==Legacy==
Seven animated features from Disney (&quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;) and several animated cartoon shorts (&quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, Betty Boop&#x27;s take of &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;Popeye Meets Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot;, &quot;Gerald McBoing Boing&quot;, &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Opera Doc?&quot;) were each inducted into the National Film Registry. The aforementioned shorts were also part of animation historian&#x27;s Jerry Beck&#x27;s 1994 book survey of &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot;.

===Depictions in popular culture===
The 1988 film &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; has honored both the golden age of American animation and classical Hollywood cinema. The film featured cameos of various famous animated cartoon characters from multiple animation studios, such as Disney, Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, MGM, Universal Animation Studios, and among others. The film also contains the only time in cinematic history that Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cross over with Warner Bros. Studios&#x27; Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, respectively, onscreen. In fact, the golden age of American animation is very influential in that it would later pave the way to certain animated cartoon shows like: &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;Bonkers&quot;, &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, and &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (influenced by the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short films), &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; (influenced by the Warner Bros. and MGM cartoons), the animated series of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (influenced by theatrical cartoons of &quot;Superman&quot;), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (influenced by &quot;The Flintstones&quot;), and &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (influenced by classic Walt Disney&#x27;s cartoons). Likewise, the Fleischer aesthetic of the aforementioned animated superhero series was combined to recreate the futuristic designs of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; and &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, while the Chuck Jones, Maurice Noble and &quot;The Jetsons&quot; aesthetics influenced the retro designs of &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. Other television productions influenced by classic theatrical animation were most of the animated series in &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; block.

Most of the Disney Renaissance movies and the feature film &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; were made with similar animation techniques to those of the golden age. In addition, the 1999 feature film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; is a direct sequel to the original 1940 feature film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Furthermore, CGI feature films like &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot; and &quot;The Wild Robot&quot;, were also inspired by classic animations. On the other hand, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was produced with recycled animations and designs from the original Walt Disney films, while the short film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; was recognized for the return of classic Disney characters to theatrical animation. In fact, the golden age has also influenced other animated short films, such as &quot;Paperman&quot;, &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;, &quot;Prise de Bec&quot;, &quot;The Brave Locomotive&quot; and the &quot;Pudgy and Grunge&quot; animated film segment of &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;. Though only one minute of the cartoon is shown during the film, Jones and his team animated five minutes of footage Likewise, the first Winnie the Pooh animated shorts were compiled with new ones in the feature film &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, getting its own popular franchise. On the other hand, Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s stop motion animation served as inspiration for the production of the feature films &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, while the special effects themes in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; inspired other science fiction productions, including the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film trilogy, plus the movies &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;The Terminator&quot;.

Other animated feature films such as: &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot;, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Nutcracker Prince&quot;, &quot;Thumbelina&quot;, &quot;The Swan Princess&quot;, &quot;Balto&quot;, &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, &quot;Anastasia&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, were also influenced by the aesthetics in the animations of the golden age. This trend of making animations with classic designs was very relevant during the renaissance age of American animation, a period in which the nostalgia market was particularly strong among the audience, starting with &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; and &quot;An American Tail&quot;.

Chuck Jones and Tex Avery&#x27;s cartoons served as inspiration for the development of the video game franchises: &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;, &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; and &quot;Ty the Tasmanian Tiger&quot;, as well as heavily influencing the designs and slapstick humor of the original &quot;Ice Age&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; trilogies. Similarly, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was made to attract a wide audience and with reference to Walt Disney&#x27;s classic films, while &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; was influenced by the designs of classic cel animated films. Additionally, Disney&#x27;s period during the silent era and the golden age influenced the development of the 2010 video game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;. In addition, the 2017 video game &quot;Cuphead&quot; and the 2022 interactive film &quot;Cat Burglar&quot; feature a classic animation style inspired by the works of Disney, Tex Avery and Fleischer from this period.

Oscar-nominated animator Andrew Chesworth formerly worked at Disney (being animator on &quot;Wreck It Ralph&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;, &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, &quot;Feast&quot;, &quot;Zootopia&quot; and &quot;Moana&quot;) and Netflix (on the 2019 Annie Award for Best Animated Feature winner &quot;Klaus&quot;) while working independently on his passion projects including his 2023 Oscar-qualifying &quot;The Brave Locomotive&quot;, a love letter to the Andrews Sisters and 1940s animation. First conceived in 2008, he released online in 2015 the opening sequence that was in progress before shelving it after being hired by Disney in 2011. 

===Impact in other countries===
The golden age of American animation, especially Walt Disney&#x27;s cartoons, was very influential around the world, particularly:

* In France, the French animator Jean Image was influenced by the theatrical cartoons of this period. Likewise, Paul Grimault was influenced by Disney&#x27;s animated feature films in making his magnum opus &quot;The King and the Mockingbird&quot; (first released in 1952 and starring Peter Ustinov as the mockingbird; in 1980 Grimault would release his own version after retaining the rights to the film).
* In Germany, the German animator Hans Fischerkoesen was influenced by the theatrical cartoons of this period.

* In Japan, the Japanese mangaka Osamu Tezuka was greatly influenced by Walt Disney&#x27;s animation alongside the Fleischers. This allowed him to make the drawings of &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Princess Knight&quot;. Likewise, Walt Disney&#x27;s cartoons served as inspiration for Shigeru Miyamoto, thus developing the &quot;Super Mario&quot; video game franchise.

<text>Animation in the United States in the television era was a period in the history of American animation that gradually started in the late 1950s with the decline of theatrical animated shorts and popularization of television animation, reached its peak during the 1970s, and ended around the late 1980s. This era is characterized by low budgets, limited animation, an emphasis on television over the theater, and the general perception of cartoons being primarily for children.

Television animation developed from the success of Disney’s theatrical animated movies, along with Warner Bros.’ &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and MGM’s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons in the first half of the 20th century. The state of animation changed dramatically in the three decades starting with the post-World War II proliferation of television. While studios gave up on the big-budget theatrical short animated cartoons that thrived in the golden age, new television animation studios would thrive based on the economy and volume of their output. Many popular and famous animated cartoon characters emerged from this period, including Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Scooby-Doo, Josie and the Pussycats, Captain Caveman, and Hong Kong Phooey, Filmation&#x27;s He-Man, DiC Entertainment&#x27;s Inspector Gadget, and Marvel Productions&#x27; and Sunbow Productions&#x27; The Transformers. The period came to an end in the late 1980s as many entertainment companies revived their animation franchises and returned to making high-budget, successful works.

Due to the perceived cheap production values, poor animation, and mixed critical and commercial reception, this period is sometimes referred to as the bronze age or dark age of American animation by critics and animation historians. Despite this, the era is fondly remembered by members of Generation X who grew up with Saturday morning cartoons in the 1970s and 1980s.

==From theaters to television==
===Early experiments===
There were a number of early experiments in limited animation television cartoons. These cartoons usually were about five minutes in length and were episodic in nature, allowing stations to flexibly program them. One of the first images to be broadcast over television was that of Felix the Cat in 1928. Historian Harvey Deneroff of the Savannah College of Art and Design suggests that animator Don Figlozzi drew some of the first animations to be used on television, working for Popeye films in 1931. In 1938, cartoonist Chad Grothkopf&#x27;s eight-minute experimental &quot;Willie the Worm&quot;, cited as the first animated film created for TV, was shown on NBC. Another one of the first cartoons produced expressly for television was &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; (1950), a creation of Alexander Anderson and Jay Ward. Soundac, a small studio in Florida, was responsible for another early adventure serial, &quot;Colonel Bleep&quot;. Often, existing programs would be a launching ground for new cartoon characters. In 1956, the &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show aired the first &quot;Gumby&quot; clay animated cartoon from creator Art Clokey. Sam Singer earned a certain degree of infamy for his efforts at television animation, which included an animated adaptation of &quot;The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican&quot; (which may or may not have made it to air) and the original series &quot;Bucky and Pepito&quot;, both of which have been cited as among the worst of their kind. On the other hand, a long-running series of animated shorts named &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; was produced by Terrytoons for the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; show, and this series was praised by film historian Leonard Maltin as &quot;one of the finest cartoons ever produced for television.&quot;

Cartoons in the Golden Age, such as the works of The Fleischer Brothers and Tex Avery, contained topical and often suggestive humor, though they were seen primarily as &quot;children&#x27;s entertainment&quot; by movie exhibitors. Beginning in 1954, Walt Disney capitalized on the medium of television with his own weekly TV series, &quot;Disneyland.&quot; This ABC show popularized his new Disneyland theme park and began a decades-long series of TV broadcasts of Disney cartoons, which later expanded into the show &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;. While Disney recognized that the economics of the medium could not support his production standards and refused to go into TV animation, he still ordered the creation of one character exclusive to TV, Ludwig Von Drake. The character&#x27;s segments would link compilations of the company&#x27;s archived theatrical shorts as complete episodes.

===Saturday morning cartoons and TV specials===

As TV became a phenomenon and began to draw audiences away from movie theaters, many children&#x27;s TV shows included airings of theatrical cartoons in their schedules, and this introduced a new generation of children to the cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s. Cartoon producer Paul Terry sold the rights to the Terrytoons cartoon library to television and retired from the business in the early 1950s. This guaranteed a long life for the characters of Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle, whose cartoons were syndicated and rerun in children&#x27;s television programming blocks for the next 30 to 40 years.

By the late 1950s and 1960s, the perception of cartoons as children&#x27;s entertainment was entrenched in the public consciousness, enough so that Federal Communications Commission chairman Newton Minow, in his landmark 1961 speech &quot;Television and the Public Interest,&quot; denounced the medium of animation as a whole and compared it to feeding children junk food all of the time. Animation began to disappear from movie theaters; while Disney continued to produce animated features after losing its founder, MGM and Warner Bros. closed their studios, outsourced their animation, and got out of it entirely by the end of the decade.

During the 1960s and 1970s, it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind (DePatie-Freleng, established by two former WB employees, was particularly associated with this business model). By selling the shorts to theaters, the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone, which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user (except for a minority of households that had cable television) rather than strictly a medium for delivering signals from distant TV stations.

Animation on television focused almost exclusively on children, and the tradition of getting up early to watch Saturday morning cartoons became a weekly ritual for millions of American kids. The networks were glad to oblige their demands by providing hours-long blocks of cartoon shows. Hanna-Barbera Productions became the leader in the production of TV cartoons for children. A number of other studios produced TV cartoons, such as Filmation (&quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, &quot;The Archies&quot;) and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises (&quot;The Pink Panther&quot;), but Hanna-Barbera had developed a virtual lock on Saturday morning cartoons by the 1970s. Such critics of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s style of limited animation as Chuck Jones referred to it disparagingly as &quot;illustrated radio&quot;, yet when one show was cancelled, the studio usually had another one ready to replace it because they were so cheap to produce.

From the mid-1960s through the early 1980s, several successful prime-time animated TV specials aired. Because these one-shot cartoons were aired during prime-time hours (and thus had to appeal to adults as well as children), they had to obtain higher ratings than their Saturday and weekday counterparts. CBS in particular allowed a large number of animated TV specials to air on its network, and several of these continue to be repeated annually and sold on video and DVD. The Rankin-Bass studio produced a number of stop-motion specials geared towards popular holidays (including &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, and &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;); while Bill Melendez&#x27;s long-running series of &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials won numerous awards, spawned four feature films, and even launched a Saturday morning series. Other attempts to bring comic strip characters to TV did not have anywhere near as much success until one of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; directors, Phil Roman, brought the Jim Davis comic strip &quot;Garfield&quot; to TV starting in 1982, resulting in 11 specials and a long-running animated series.

Though the dominant Hanna-Barbera Productions launched a phenomenon with the 1981 premiere of &quot;The Smurfs&quot; on NBC, very little else which they produced in the 1980s caught on. Adding to this was the financial problems of their owner Taft Broadcasting, which was taken over by Carl Lindner, Jr., owner of Great American Insurance Company, in 1987. Two years later, Tom Ruegger launched an exodus of H-B employees to form a relaunched Warner Bros. Animation division. In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System bought the company and its library.

Other studios&#x27; offerings chipped away at the H-B Saturday dominance throughout the decade, such as H-B alumni Ruby-Spears Productions&#x27; &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, Marvel and Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, DiC and Columbia&#x27;s &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, and Film Roman&#x27;s &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;. Additionally, the Saturday morning continued to see attempts to adapt prime time series for animation, some successfully (&quot;Happy Days&quot; and its spinoffs, &quot;Mister T&quot;, &quot;&quot;), others less so (&quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;, &quot;The Gary Coleman Show&quot;, &quot;Little Rosie&quot;). After three decades of resistance, Disney finally jumped on the Saturday morning bandwagon in 1985 when &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; and &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; debuted with significantly more substantial budgets; the first-run syndication success of &quot;DuckTales&quot;, which premiered in 1987, eventually inspired a whole block of Disney-produced syndicated cartoons which forced competing studios to improve their own production standards to compete.

The 1980s also saw a number of cartoons based on children&#x27;s toys, such as &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;, &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony &#x27;n Friends&quot;, &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;, and &quot;Care Bears&quot;. There were even cartoons based on &quot;Pac-Man&quot; video games and &quot;the Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;. Some of them even inspired feature films. While many of them were successful with children, shows like these were accused of being glorified toy commercials by parents&#x27; groups such as Action for Children&#x27;s Television. These groups also objected to the level of violence in many of these shows. ACT&#x27;s efforts to curb these trends resulted in the Children&#x27;s Television Act, enacted in 1990 and strictly enforced by the FCC starting in 1996.

==Major animation studios==
===Hanna-Barbera===
The first major animation studio to produce cartoons exclusively for television was Hanna-Barbera Productions. When MGM closed its cartoon studio in 1957, Hanna-Barbera began producing cartoons directly for television, finding an audience in the evening &quot;family hour&quot; time. The first animated series from Hanna-Barbera were NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show&quot;, the first-run syndication entry &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot; each of which followed a format of three shorts, each the approximate length of a one-reel short film. However, the studio hit its stride in 1960s with ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, the first half-hour animated sitcom. Like many of its immediate successors it was originally aired during prime time when the whole family would be watching television. &quot;The Flintstones&quot; was the first of several prime-time animated series from Hanna-Barbera, which included &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, and &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;. But after the end of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in 1966, Hanna-Barbera largely turned its efforts to the growing market for Saturday morning cartoons, outside of isolated series for first run syndication in the 1970s, aimed at adults instead of children, such as &quot;Where&#x27;s Huddles?&quot; and &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot;.

Hanna-Barbera was notorious for using common tropes in its series. Its original series of the late 1950s through mid-1960s all featured anthropomorphic animals, usually an adult (who would in turn impersonate a well-known celebrity) and child, interacting with the humans of their environment. After the immense success of &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, which premiered on CBS in 1969, the next decade of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s animated output would follow that show&#x27;s formula: a group of teenagers solving supernatural (or apparently supernatural) mysteries or fighting crime, usually with the help of a wacky animal or a ghost. The many incarnations of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; ran uninterrupted on CBS and then ABC for 17 seasons. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hanna-Barbera turned to adaptations of prime time sitcoms. It was not until &quot;The Smurfs&quot; in 1981 that H-B once again had anything successful outside the &quot;Scooby&quot; template; it, in turn, led to derivative series (&quot;The Snorks&quot; and &quot;Paw Paws&quot;). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw Hanna-Barbera join the numerous studios producing younger and junior versions of cartoon characters for the Saturday morning cartoon market, such as &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot; and &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;.

One of the problems with producing animation for television was the extremely labor-intensive animation process. While theatrical short subjects were previously produced in six-month cycles or longer, networks needed a season of 10-20 half hour episodes every year. This led to a number of shortcut techniques to speed up the production process, and the techniques of limited animation were applied to produce a great number of quickly-produced, low-budget TV cartoons. Hanna-Barbera also used limited animation for artistic reasons: with smaller, low-resolution screens, the company&#x27;s namesakes reasoned that a limited style that focused on dialogue, exaggerated sound effects and close-up shots with bold outlines worked better than the fully detailed animation used in film shorts, which were designed for large theater screens.

===UPA===
The UPA studio was one of the first victims of the TV-animation market. In 1952, because of his left-wing social activism, John Hubley was dismissed from the studio under pressure from Columbia Pictures (who was itself under pressure from the HUAC). The creative atmosphere post-Hubley was not the same and UPA&#x27;s theatrical shorts ended in 1959. In order to stay afloat financially, UPA turned to television to sustain itself. The TV versions of &quot;Mister Magoo&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; were not successful and did nothing to reverse the studio&#x27;s financial decline. In spite of the 1962 animated feature &quot;Gay Purr-ee&quot; (distributed by Warner Bros.), which featured the voices of Judy Garland and Robert Goulet and a Harold Arlen/Yip Harburg song score, and the beloved animated special &quot;Mr. Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, UPA was shut down in 1964.

===Jay Ward Productions===
The Jay Ward studio, producer of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show,&quot; used limited animation in its series, but compensated with its satire of Cold War politics and popular culture and its off-beat humor. Like the earlier &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot;, the Rocky and Bullwinkle adventures were multi-part serials. The Ward studio also produced &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Super Chicken&quot;, and &quot;Tom Slick&quot;. It later produced a series of popular television commercials for Quaker Oats cereals Cap&#x27;n Crunch, Quisp and Quake. Another company that used the same animation studios as Jay Ward did was Total Television, most famous for &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;. Total Television and Jay Ward animated productions were often mixed and aired together in syndication, leading to the two companies&#x27; shows to sometimes be confused with each other.

===Filmation===
Filmation, headed by Lou Scheimer, Hal Sutherland, and Norm Prescott, was another television animation studio that arose in the 1960s. Founded in 1962, Filmation was most famous for its acquisition of licenses to produce animated series based on other media. It was one of the few companies to keep all of its animation within the United States and did not use the aesthetics of limited animation preferred by Hanna-Barbera and UPA; instead, Filmation productions relied on heavy usage of stock footage, rotoscoping, limited voice casts (Scheimer himself provided many voices) and a balance of licensed animated series with lower-budget, live-action ones (such as &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot; and &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;) to stay financially solvent. After a string of Saturday-morning successes lasting well into the 1980s (chiefly &quot;Fat Albert&quot;), Filmation had several costly syndicated failures, namely &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;BraveStarr&quot;, and a lawsuit from Disney over &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, forcing its parent company Westinghouse to shut down the studio and sell off its library in 1989.

===Cambria Studios===
One of the most infamous users of limited animation was Cambria Studios, which invented and patented a process known as Syncro-Vox, implementing it beginning in 1960. While the process resulted in an extremely economical, quick and inexpensive product (thus making it ideal for television), it had a fatal flaw that prevented it from being taken seriously: the process involved inserting the moving lips of the voice actor over a still frame of a character&#x27;s mouth. The result was that Cambria&#x27;s cartoons (&quot;Clutch Cargo&quot;, &quot;Space Angel&quot; and &quot;Captain Fathom&quot;) contained hardly any animation at all, and were effectively pictures (albeit well-drawn ones that were of greater detail than other producers&#x27;) with words. Cambria switched to a more mainstream limited animation process with &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot; in 1965, but went out of business shortly afterward.

===Disney===
In the 1960s, Walt Disney&#x27;s current animated films (&quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, the live-action/animated combo &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;) generated hefty revenue for the studio, as did the regular reissues of earlier animated films. &quot;Poppins&quot;, in particular, won five Academy Awards (and received with the studio&#x27;s first Best Picture nomination) and topped the 1964 box office charts while launching the film career of its star, Julie Andrews, who won an Oscar. &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;, now on NBC, became a Sunday night television institution that kept Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, and Pluto in the public consciousness long after their theatrical cartoon series had ended. The anthology series ran until 1983. In 1961, Walt helped to establish the California Institute of the Arts. The founding of the institute was both a philanthropic gesture and a savvy investment by Disney, as the school provided plenty of creative talent for the company in the years to come. In 1966, the studio brought A.A. Milne&#x27;s Winnie-the-Pooh characters to the screen for the first time in two of four animated featurettes (the second of which, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;, won an Oscar, the last Walt Disney received).

The Disney empire was rocked to its core when Walt died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966. While the studio tried to remain true to his vision (a common catchphrase of the time was &quot;What would Walt do?&quot;), the level of popularity and acclaim the studio received in earlier years eluded it in the 1970s. The theme parks Disneyland and Walt Disney World (the latter having opened in 1971) ended up contributing more to the bottom line than the film division. Additionally, many veteran animators either retired or died, so the studio had to find ways to replace them. In 1973, Eric Larson started a training program for new animators.

The studio&#x27;s post-Walt animation fare consisted of the features &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, the featurettes &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bird&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!&quot;, &quot;The Small One&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot;, and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, and the live-action/animation hybrids &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; and &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;. Some of the films got mixed reactions from critics; &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, in particular, was widely criticized for re-use of animation from earlier films (especially in the production number &quot;The Phony King of England&quot;), but this was done because the film had fallen way behind schedule. Still, all of these films were successful and many of them received Academy Award nominations (with two wins, one for the short &quot;Bird&quot; and another for the special effects in &quot;Bedknobs&quot;). Additionally, in keeping with Walt&#x27;s original intentions, the first three &quot;Pooh&quot; featurettes were compiled into the 1977 feature &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;.

The most devastating development since Walt&#x27;s death occurred in September 1979, when studio animator Don Bluth led a walkout of himself and 11 of his supporters (a large chunk of the studio&#x27;s animation department at the time), including Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy. Fed up with the status quo at Disney, he and his acolytes left to start his own studio, which produced the short film &quot;Banjo the Woodpile Cat&quot; and the feature film &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. Disney entered the 1980s facing an uncertain future, despite the respectable $39,900,000 gross and some good reviews for &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, and the animation department faced more jeopardy and pandemonium in 1985 with &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, which was the Disney studio’s first PG-rated animated film and the most expensive animated film ever made at the time.

===The end of Termite Terrace===
Warner Bros. shut down its animation studio completely in 1963, and the directors of Termite Terrace went their separate ways. Friz Freleng co-founded DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which produced &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; from 1964 to 1967. Warner Bros.-Seven Arts reopened the studio from 1967 to 1969, but the low-budget cartoons produced were not popular with critics or audiences then or now. The new characters introduced during the Seven Arts period, such as Cool Cat, Bunny and Claude, Quick Brown Fox and Rapid Rabbit, and Merlin the Magic Mouse, never caught on, while the Termite Terrace cartoons remained perennial television favorites through syndication and Saturday morning airings throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

===Chuck Jones and MGM===
In 1961, Chuck Jones moonlighted as a writer on the UPA feature &quot;Gay Purr-ee&quot;. When Warner Bros. distributed the film the following year, they discovered that he had contributed to the film in violation of his exclusive contract and fired him. Jones teamed with Les Goldman to form Sib Tower 12 Productions, later renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts, to work with MGM on the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series in the mid-1960s; his shorts were not as popular as the Hanna-Barbera originals but more so than the Gene Deitch shorts produced overseas in the early 1960s. Jones then began producing a number of successful animated TV specials. His most famous special was &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, a 1966 CBS adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story that still remains popular and has been released on video and DVD several times. Jones also produced three animated adaptations of short stories from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, a full-length MGM feature film entitled &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, and the 1970 TV version of &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;

===DePatie-Freleng===

After leaving the remnants of Termite Terrace behind for good, Friz Freleng and his new partner David H. DePatie went on to produce the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s, with the cartoons appearing almost simultaneously on television and in theaters through a distribution deal with United Artists. Freleng also produced several TV specials based on Dr. Seuss books throughout the 1970s, including &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and &quot;The Lorax&quot;.

In 1981, Friz Freleng retired, and shortly thereafter Marvel Comics bought out the DFE studio, due largely to its pre-existing relationship from the commissioned shows &quot;The New Fantastic Four&quot; (1978) and &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; (1979). The studio continued under DePatie&#x27;s lead as Marvel Productions. This new studio continued saturday-morning fare but focused almost exclusively on licensed properties, first with Marvel shows like &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, then shifting to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and the long-lasting &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. Sunbow Productions, commissioned by Hasbro, began farming out animation to Marvel Productions for toy merchandising, first as commercials, then as syndicated series, like action-oriented cartoons such as &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; and &quot;The Transformers&quot;, and later with &quot;My Little Pony &#x27;n Friends&quot; and &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot;. Marvel Productions found a new audience among young viewers, but was hampered by the collapse of the syndication market and multiple changes in ownership.

==Counterculture==
The majority of American animation came to be dominated by limited animation made for TV and aimed primarily at children. However, there were a number of attempts to challenge this perception during the late 1960s and 1970s with ambitious (and often controversial) animated projects that were often not for children.

===&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;===
In 1968, the music of The Beatles and the Peter Max-inspired psychedelic artwork of Canadian-born animator George Dunning came together to create &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Displeased with the previous animated television series depicting themselves, the Beatles themselves had reservations about the project at first and declined to participate beyond providing a mix of older and original musical recordings. However, they were impressed enough with the finished film to appear in a live action epilogue.

===Ralph Bakshi===

In 1968, Ralph Bakshi, along with producer Steve Krantz, founded Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time. In 1969, Ralph&#x27;s Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and &quot;Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse&quot;, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as saying that the idea of &quot;grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.&quot; Bakshi soon developed &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi&#x27;s lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark&#x27;s Place, Bakshi came across a copy of &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Fritz the Cat&quot;. Impressed by Crumb&#x27;s sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and is the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. With the success of his second film, &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.

===Music videos===
The 1980s also saw the rise of the music video industry, spearheaded by MTV. Artistic experimentation in these short films often resulted in the production of innovative animated sequences that reminded viewers of the potential of animation as something other than Saturday morning cartoons. A number of memorable animated videos were produced during the heyday of MTV, including a-ha&#x27;s &quot;Take On Me&quot; by British director Steve Barron; Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; with animation by Aardman Animations and Brothers Quay; the groundbreaking computer-animated Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; directed by Steve Barron; and The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; with animated sequences directed by Ralph Bakshi and John Kricfalusi. MTV also had a plethora of wild and experimental animated idents, made by uncredited animators.

===Anime comes to North America===
Throughout this period, Japanese anime production made a limited impact on the Northern American market. The most notable work were the television series like &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Gigantor&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, and &quot;Speed Racer&quot; in the 1960s; &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;, &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, and &quot;Tales of Magic&quot; in the late 1970s; and &quot;Force Five&quot;, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (1980), &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;Leo the Lion&quot;, &quot;Belle and Sebastian&quot;, &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of the Little Prince&quot;, &quot;Ulysses 31&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot;, &quot;Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years&quot;, &quot;Macron 1&quot;, and &quot;Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs&quot; in the 1980s. As a rule, the imported series were heavily reworked through edits and dubbing to match Western expectations and stereotypes. For this reason, &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;, and &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (1980) were dubbed a second time to Westernize them &quot;more&quot; and reappeared in 1985-6, the first two retitled &quot;Tranzor Z&quot; and &quot;G-Force: Guardians of Space&quot;. Imports were also heavily censored to make them acceptable to parents; &quot;Star Blazers&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot; were partial exceptions. Syndicated series stopped after the failure of &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;, &quot;Macron 1&quot;, and &quot;Saber Rider&quot;, and only Nickelodeon and HBO would program child-oriented anime through the end of the 1980s. The production companies Harmony Gold and WEP abandoned anime on TV, but Saban would go on to play a key role in the anime boom of the mid-90s. Although their impact on visual style and storytelling in North America was minimal for decades, the success of some of these series helped create the groundswell that would lead to mail-order VHS releases of adult-oriented movies and OVAs in the late 1980s.

===Other animation===
A few attempts were made to produce independent feature-length animated films in the 1970s. Several of these were decidedly adult-oriented productions from outside the United States, including the Canadian &quot;Heavy Metal,&quot; the English &quot;Watership Down&quot; and a live-action/animated version of the Pink Floyd concept album &quot;The Wall&quot;, all of which received wide release in the United States. Other films like Richard Williams&#x27; &quot;Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure&quot; were less successful. The industry largely continued to ignore or dismiss animation as something only kids watched on Saturday morning television, not to mention that some feature-length animations became less viable than TV animations. A notable exception was a series of films based on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise, beginning with the 1969 film &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, which was both a commercial and critical success; the films were made with the same production team behind the acclaimed &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials that were airing throughout the time period, led by Bill Melendez.

Fine Arts Films, a studio founded by John David Wilson with offices in Hollywood and in England, became best known for its music videos (eg: Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;You Gotta Serve Somebody&quot;). Several of the videos appeared on the American variety show &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; (these shorts were compiled into &quot;The Fantastic All-Electric Music Movie&quot;), and one appeared as the opening sequence and title track to the hit film &quot;Grease&quot;.

This era also saw a number of independent animated short films that were rarely seen outside of &quot;art house&quot; movie theaters. As the Hollywood animation studios faded, a number of independent producers of animation continued to make experimental, artistic animated films that explored new artistic territory in the medium of animation. Short films such as &quot;Thank You Mask Man,&quot; &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla,&quot; &quot;Lupo the Butcher,&quot; and many others were almost unknown to mainstream audiences; however, these independent animated films continued to keep the yearly category of the Academy Award for Animated Short Film alive, as well as introducing a number of new names into the field of animation—names that would begin to bring change to the industry in the 1980s.

==End of the era==
By the end of the 1980s, most of the Golden Age of animators had retired or died, and their younger successors were ready to change the industry and the way that animation was perceived. This led to the Renaissance age of American animation, with quality animated shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Tiny Toons&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, Rugrats, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the Disney Renaissance films.

==Legacy==
This era has been continued to be satirized and/or spoofed even by the likes of the cult sci-fi series &quot;Futurama&quot; in the episode &quot;Saturday Morning Fun Pit&quot;.

The soundtrack to the Emmy-winning special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was inducted to the National Recording Registry in 2012.

Paul Driessen&#x27;s &quot;The Killing of an Egg&quot; (1977) influenced &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; creator Stephen Hillenburg to consider the field of animation after he saw it at the International Tournée of Animation.

&quot;Quasi at the Quackadero&quot; (1975) (which was part of the 1994 book survey of &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot;) and the Oscar-winning shorts &quot;The Hole&quot; (1962) and &quot;Frank Film&quot; (1973) were each inducted into the National Film Registry.

Disney animator and director Byron Howard admitted that &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was his favorite film while growing up and cited it as a major influence on his 2016&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;Zootopia&quot;. The song &quot;Whistle-Stop&quot; was sped up and used in the Hampster Dance, one of the earliest internet memes, and later used at normal speed in the Super Bowl XLVIII commercial for T-Mobile. The song &quot;Oo De Lally&quot; was featured in a 2015 commercial for Android which shows animals of different species playing together.

The Yuletide specials of Rankin/Bass have been parodied by the likes of TV series from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to &quot;South Park&quot;, while non-holiday works like &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; maintained a cult following.

The Netflix animated series &quot;Saturday Morning All Star Hits!&quot; also spoofs the mid-1980s to early 1990s era of TV animation, such as &quot;Thundercats&quot;, &quot;Care Bears&quot;, and &quot;Denver, the Last Dinosaur&quot;.

<text>Modern animation in the United States from the late 1980s to 2004 is frequently referred to as the renaissance age of American animation. During this period, many large American entertainment companies reformed and reinvigorated their animation departments, following the dark age, and the United States had an influence on global and worldwide animation.

Many companies originating in the golden age of American animation experienced newfound critical and commercial success. During the Disney Renaissance, The Walt Disney Company went back to producing critically and commercially successful animated films based on well-known stories, just as principal co-founder Walt Disney had done during his lifetime. Disney also began producing successful animated television shows, a then-first for the company, which led to the creation and launch of Disney Channel. Warner Bros. produced highly successful animated cartoon television series inspired by their classic &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons, while also launching the DC Animated Universe. Hanna-Barbera ceased production on low budget television series and, through its acquisition by Ted Turner, launched Cartoon Network. Nickelodeon, a network owned by the first and second incarnations of Viacom Inc. until 2019, ViacomCBS until 2022, and Paramount Global thereafter, rose to fame by creating the Nicktoons brand in 1991 which led to various acclaimed programs under the label in the 1990s and 2000s.

In addition, new animation studios rose to prominence during this period. Most notably, Pixar debuted with the extremely successful &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the first feature film to entirely use computer-generated imagery (CGI). DreamWorks Animation, freshly spun-out from DreamWorks (later named DreamWorks Pictures) debuted late in the era, but would become a major competitor and alternative to Disney in the subsequent decade. During this era, the technology used to produce animation would experience revolutionary shifts. Beginning in the mid-1990s, traditional animation using hand-drawn cels declined in favor of more advanced up-and-coming methods, like digital ink and paint (a modern form of traditional animation) and 3D computer animation. These changes in animation technology led to the millennium age of American animation, which started in the early 2000s and has continued into present day.

==Trends==

===Disney ===
At the start of the 1980s, The Walt Disney Company had been struggling since Walt Disney&#x27;s death in 1966, and the 1979 departure of Don Bluth and eleven other associates from the animation department dealt Disney a major blow. Bluth formed a new studio, in direct competition with Disney.

Disney&#x27;s &quot;Nine Old Men&quot;, the animators responsible for Disney&#x27;s most famous earlier works, and their associates began to hand their traditions down to a new generation of Disney animators. New faces such as Glen Keane, Ron Clements, John Musker, Andreas Deja, and others came to the studio in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period that produced such features as &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (a live-action/animation hybrid), and &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, as well as the featurettes &quot;The Small One&quot; (Bluth&#x27;s only Disney-directed credit) and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (the first screen appearance of Mickey Mouse since 1953).

At the same time, animator Steven Lisberger brought to the studio a concept about a computer programmer who is launched into a computerized world. The film would mix live-action sequences with computer animation, which had not yet been used to such an extent. The studio was impressed with the idea; the result was an ambitious $17 million film ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) entitled &quot;Tron&quot;. While Disney&#x27;s stock dropped four percent after a screening for unenthusiastic investment analysts,
and despite only moderate grosses at the box office,
&quot;Tron&quot; received enthusiastic praise from film critic Roger Ebert, became a cult favorite and turned out—many years later—to have a greater influence on animation (at Disney and elsewhere) than expected.

In 1984, Disney became the target of a corporate raid by Saul Steinberg, who intended to break up the company piece by piece. At the same time, Roy E. Disney, who had already resigned as President in 1977, relinquished his spot on the Board of Directors to use his clout to change the status quo and improve the company&#x27;s declining fortune. Disney escaped Steinberg&#x27;s attempt by paying him greenmail, but in its aftermath CEO Ron W. Miller resigned, to be replaced by Michael Eisner. Roy Disney, now back on the Board as its Vice-Chairman, convinced Eisner to let him supervise the animation department, whose future was in serious doubt after the disappointing box office performance of its big-budget PG-rated feature, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;. The studio&#x27;s next release, &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, fared better in relation to its significantly smaller budget, but it was overshadowed by Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot;, another film featuring mice characters that competed directly with &quot;Mouse Detective&quot; in theaters.

In 1988, the studio collaborated with Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, to make &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, a comedic detective caper that mixed live-action and animation while paying homage to the Golden Age of Cartoons. Disney characters appeared with characters from Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures and other rival studios for the first time in animation history. The film was a huge box-office success, winning four Academy Awards, reviving interest in animation made for theaters, and popularizing the in-depth study of the history and techniques of animation. Several aging legends in the business, such as Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng, suddenly found themselves the center of attention, receiving acclaim and accolades after decades of being virtually ignored by audiences and industry professionals alike. Additionally, the release of many older Disney features and short cartoons on home video, and the company&#x27;s creation of new Saturday-morning cartoons for CBS and NBC respectively (such as &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; and &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, renewed interest in the studio.

Disney followed up &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; with &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; in 1988 and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, an adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, in 1989 with songs by Broadway composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was a huge critical and commercial success. It won two Academy Awards for its song and score and became the first of a series of highly successful new Disney animated features.

The studio invested heavily in new technology, creating the Computer Animation Production System to be used in tandem with traditional animation techniques. The first film to use this technology, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, only grossed $27,931,461 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars), not even equalling the take of the original 1977 film.

However, the films that followed it, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;, won rave reviews, received multiple Oscars, and topped the box office charts. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; would eventually become the first animated feature to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, followed by 2009&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot; and 2010&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;.

In 1993, Disney released &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, the first feature-length stop-motion animated film. Disney&#x27;s success peaked in 1994, when &quot;The Lion King&quot; grossed $328,541,776 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) and became the highest grossing movie of that year. As of 2024, &quot;The Lion King&quot; ranked as the 22nd highest-grossing motion picture of all time in the United States and the highest-grossing hand-drawn movie of all time. Subsequent Disney films from 1995 to 2000, including &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; were box office and/or critical successes as well, albeit modestly so when compared to Disney&#x27;s early-1990s releases.

In 1994, the death of Disney President and Chief Operating Officer Frank Wells, and the departure of studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to co-found DreamWorks, left Michael Eisner in full control of the company. At the turn of the century, films such as &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (Disney&#x27;s first CG animated feature), &quot;&quot;, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot; failed to meet the critical and commercial expectations set by the 1990s phenomena, despite exceptions such as &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. At the same time, the high level of popular acclaim bestowed upon &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the first CGI animated film, sparked an industry trend. Based on the commercial success of Pixar&#x27;s animated movies and other CGI fare (especially DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Shrek&quot;, which contained numerous jabs at Katzenberg&#x27;s former workplace and boss), Disney came to believe that CGI was what the public wanted, so it ceased producing traditional animation after &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, and switched exclusively to CGI starting with 2005&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Little&quot;.

Public rifts grew between the animation staff and management, as well as between Michael Eisner and Roy E. Disney. Roy resigned from the board of directors in 2003 with a scathing letter calling the company &quot;rapacious and soulless&quot;, adding that he considered it &quot;always looking for the quick buck.&quot; He then launched the internet site SaveDisney.com in an attempt to preserve the integrity of the company and to oust Eisner, who resigned in 2005 after public opinion turned against him.

Robert Iger succeeded Eisner; one of his first acts as CEO was to regain the rights to Walt Disney&#x27;s first star Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from NBCUniversal (Iger did so by offering NBC the services of Al Michaels, a play-by-play host then under contract to Disney subsidiary ABC Sports, as a trade). After Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, Pixar executive producer John Lasseter became Chief Creative Officer at both Pixar and Disney, with a plan to reintroduce two-dimensional animation, starting with &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; in 2009, but was abruptly halted after &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; was commercially unsuccessful in 2011.

====Television animation ====
After 30 years of resisting offers to produce television animation, Disney finally relented once Michael Eisner, who had a background in TV, took over. The first TV cartoons to carry the Disney name, CBS&#x27; &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, both premiered in the fall of 1985. Breaking from standard practice in the medium, the productions enjoyed substantially larger production budgets than average, allowing for higher-quality writing and animation, in anticipation of recouping profitably in rerun syndication. While &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; only lasted a season, &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; was a sustained success with a six-season run.

In 1987, the TV animation division adapted Carl Barks&#x27; Scrooge McDuck comic books for the small screen with the syndicated hit &quot;DuckTales&quot;. Its success spawned a 1990 theatrical film entitled &quot;DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp&quot; and an increased investment in syndicated cartoons. The result of this investment was &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; in 1990, a two-hour syndicated television programming block of such animated cartoon shows as: &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1988-1991), &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; (1989–1991), &quot;TaleSpin&quot; (1990–1991), &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991–1993, also airing on ABC), &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992–1994, also airing on ABC), &quot;Bonkers&quot; (1993–1994), &quot;Marsupilami&quot; (1993–1995), the critically acclaimed and still-popular &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1994–1997), and &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; (1997–2000). TV animation also brought some animated feature film characters to Saturday morning, including &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1992–1994), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1994–1995), &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot; (1995–1999), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1998–1999) (the first three on CBS), and later &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot; (2001–2003) and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003).

The perennially-popular Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse made his comeback and a revival on television with the animated series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999-2000), an animated series that paid homage to all the classic Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney cartoons. &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; was later followed by the Mickey Mouse/Disney character crossover series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001-2003), the educational series &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (2006-2016, which aired on Playhouse Disney and then Disney Junior), and &quot;Mickey Mouse/The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot; (2013-2020, 2020-2023). Additionally, the studio produced animated series for Disney Channel such as &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2002-2007), &quot;The Proud Family&quot; (2001-2005), &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot; (2005-2007), &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; (2007-2024), &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot; (2015-2019), &quot;Amphibia&quot; (2019-2022) &quot;The Owl House&quot; (2020-2023) and, more recently, &quot;Kiff&quot; (2023–present), the studio is now a parent company of Disney Branded Television (then Disney Channels Worldwide).

====Direct-to-video sequels====
DisneyToon Studios was founded in Paris in the late 1980s to produce &quot;DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp&quot;, which is not considered by the studio to be part of the Disney animated &quot;canon&quot;. The practice of making non-canon direct-to-video sequels to canon films began in 1994 with &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Aladdin&quot;. This was a reversal of the long-standing studio policy against sequels to animated films (which did not apply to live-action films); Walt Disney has often been quoted on the subject as saying &quot;you can&#x27;t top pigs with pigs&quot;, a reference to how the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; short managed to get more than three sequels. Because of strong video sales, the studio continued to make these films despite negative critical reaction; 2002&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella II: Dreams Come True&quot; received a rare 11% rating from the review-aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes. Under John Lasseter, the studio brought this practice to an end.

DisneyToon also produced several non-canon entries that &quot;did&quot; receive theatrical releases, such as &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;. The latter brought the Sherman Brothers back to the studio for their first Disney feature film score since &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; in 1971.

===Don Bluth ===

Don Bluth&#x27;s company had been driven to bankruptcy twice: once, as Don Bluth Productions, after the disappointing box office take of &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; coincided with an animator&#x27;s strike; and again, as the Bluth Group, after the Video game crash of 1983—when Cinematronics, in an attempt to cut its losses, charged fees and royalties of over $3 million ($ adjusted for inflation) to Bluth&#x27;s company while it was working on a sequel to the laserdisc-based animated arcade videogame &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;.

Bluth formed Sullivan Bluth Studios with backing from businessman Morris Sullivan, while film director Steven Spielberg—a long-time animation fan who was interested in producing theatrical animation helped Bluth to produce 1986&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot;. The film was a hit, grossing $47,483,002 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). During its production, the studio relocated to Ireland, taking advantage of government tax breaks for film production. Bluth&#x27;s 1988 follow-up &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; was a slightly bigger hit, grossing $48,092,846 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) and spawning 12 sequels and a TV series. Neither Bluth nor Spielberg was involved with any of the &quot;Land Before Time&quot; sequels; Spielberg produced the 1991 sequel &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot; without Bluth.

To gain further creative control, Bluth parted company with Spielberg on his next film, the 1989 release &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;. While the film had the misfortune of opening the same day as Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, it fared much better on home video.

The early 1990s were difficult for the studio; it released several box office failures. In 1992, &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; was panned by critics and ignored by audiences; its dismal box-office performance of $11,657,385 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) contributed to Sullivan Bluth&#x27;s bankruptcy. Bluth&#x27;s next feature, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Thumbelina&quot; fared a little better critically but even worse commercially, while &quot;A Troll in Central Park&quot;, also released in 1994, barely got a theatrical release, grossing $71,368 against a budget of $23,000,000 (or $ against $ in current terms).

Sullivan Bluth Studios closed in 1995. Bluth and Goldman returned to the United States a year earlier to discuss the creation of a feature-animation division at 20th Century Fox; the studio&#x27;s three previous animated films (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Forest&quot;, and the live-action/animation hybrid &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;) had all failed. &quot;Anastasia&quot;, a musical remake of the 1956 film with Ingrid Bergman, did far better than any Bluth film since &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven&quot;, but the 2000 release of &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, a film far different from the ones Bluth had been making, was a flop. Fox Animation Studios closed soon afterwards; nearly all Fox feature animation was produced by its Blue Sky Studios unit until the Fox Animation Studios imprint was revived, without Bluth or Goldman, in 2009.

===Warner Bros. Animation===
After parting ways with Bluth, Spielberg turned to television animation, working with the Warner Bros. Entertainment Co. to bring back its animation department, which it had abandoned in the 1960s. A team of former Hanna-Barbera employees led by Tom Ruegger formed a new studio, Warner Bros. Animation, to produce &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures,&quot; an animated series that paid homage to the Warner Bros. cartoons of Termite Terrace. The popularity of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; among young TV viewers made the studio a contender once again in the field of animated cartoons. &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; was followed by &quot;Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs&quot; and its spinoff &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. Not only did these cartoons bring in new viewers to Warner Bros., but they also captured the attention of older viewers. Warner Bros., minus Spielberg, continued with work such as &quot;&quot;. &quot;Batman&quot; quickly received wide acclaim for its animation and mature writing, and it also inspired . Combined, these four Warner Bros. series won a total of 17 Daytime Emmy Awards.

When Disney&#x27;s feature animation surged in the 1990s, Warner Bros. tried to capitalize on their rival&#x27;s success with animated feature films of their own, without the assistance of Spielberg. Their films—&quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; and &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;—failed to come close to Disney&#x27;s success, although &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; and &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; both received critical praise and developed cult followings. The 2001 live-action/animation hybrid &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;, starring Bill Murray, was a costly commercial failure, although its home video performance proved successful enough for the studio&#x27;s TV animation department to produce a short-lived spin-off series called &quot;Ozzy and Drix&quot;.

The perennially popular &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters made a comeback. While the older shorts continued to enjoy countless reruns and compilation specials (and a few compilation films), new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short features were made in the 1990s. Inspired by the success of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; and a series of Nike and McDonald&#x27;s commercials teaming the characters with basketball superstar Michael Jordan, the studio produced the live-action/animation combo &quot;Space Jam&quot; in 1996. The film received mixed reviews but was a major commercial success. However, another 2003 feature, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, was a box-office flop, grossing about three-quarter of its $80 million budget worldwide ($ in current terms), but received more positive critical reviews. Other modern &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; projects were in a different vein. Unlike the original shorts, &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; (1991-1995) and &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; (2001-2006) were aimed primarily at young children, while &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; (2005-2007) was a controversial revamping of the characters in the distant future. &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot; (1995-2000) and &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (2003-2005) were very well-received shows and were relatively more faithful to the original shorts. &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (2011-2014) was a modern more adult-oriented sitcom and &quot;&quot; (2015-2020) was a modernized series of Bugs Bunny shorts in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; tradition. However, both shows still received a slightly better reception from audiences than &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; or &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot;.

===Ralph Bakshi ===
Ralph Bakshi, director of ground-breaking animated films like &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; and the original &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film, returned to animation after taking a short break in the mid-1980s. In 1985, he teamed up with young Canadian-born-and-raised animator John Kricfalusi to make a hybrid live-action/animated music video for The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, which was released in early 1986.

The music video assembled a production team at Bakshi Animation whose next project was the short-lived TV series &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;. Bakshi and company worked on several other projects in the late 1980s, but his biggest project, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Cool World&quot;, was a critically panned commercial disappointment. In 2005, Bakshi announced that he would begin working on another feature film, &quot;Last Days of Coney Island&quot;, which he is financing himself and producing independently. Bakshi suspended production on the film in 2008, but resumed in 2013 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. The film was released in 2015.

===Outsourcing animation===
The major reason for the increase in the quantity of American animation was the ability to outsource the actual physical animation work to cheaper animation houses in foreign countries. Writing, character design, and storyboarding would be done in American offices. Storyboards, model sheets, and color guides would then be mailed overseas. This would sometimes cause problems, the final product wouldn&#x27;t be seen until the completed cels were mailed back to the United States.

While budget became much less of an issue, overseas production houses would be chosen on a per-episode, or even per-scene, basis depending on the amount of money that was available at the moment. This resulted in obviously different levels of quality from episode to episode. This was particularly noticeable in shows like &quot;Gargoyles&quot; and &quot;&quot;, where at times characters would appear wildly off-model, requiring scenes to be redone to the dismay of their directors.

==First-run syndicated animation==
The older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first-run syndicated cartoons such as &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;Voltron&quot;, and reruns of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, among many others.

In 1987, The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication; &quot;DuckTales&quot; went on the air that September and lasted 100 episodes. The success of &quot;DuckTales&quot; paved the way for a second series two years later, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;. The following year, the two shows aired together under the umbrella title &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;. In 1991, Disney added another hour; the block aired in syndication until 1999.

These cartoons initially competed with the nationally broadcast ones. In the 1980s, national TV only aired Saturday mornings, not competing with the weekday and Sunday blocks of syndication aired by local independent stations but; however, by the 1990s, Fox and then WB started airing weekday afternoon blocks. By the end of the 1990s, both syndicated and national TV ended up losing most of its children&#x27;s market to the rise of cable TV channels like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network which provided appealing children&#x27;s entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours.

==Rise of the &quot;Big Three&quot; kids networks==

===From Hanna-Barbera to Cartoon Network===

The late 1980s and 1990s saw huge changes in the Saturday-morning landscape. By now, the once-prosperous Hanna-Barbera Productions was beleaguered by several factors. Its dominance over the networks&#x27; schedules was broken by other studios&#x27; shows, and once &quot;The Smurfs&quot; was cancelled by NBC in 1989, Hanna-Barbera had no other hit ongoing series on the air. Additionally, its ability to successfully exploit older characters like &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; with new shows was coming to an end; &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; would end a near-continuous 22-year first-run after its most recent juniorized version, &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, ended its run in 1991. The 1990 theatrical release of &quot;&quot; was a success for the fading studio and earned $20 million ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). In 1987, Great American Insurance Company owner Carl Lindner Jr. became the majority shareholder of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s parent company, Taft Broadcasting, renaming it Great American Communications.

Great American wanted out of the entertainment business, and Hanna-Barbera was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System in 1991. Ted Turner had expressed that he mainly wanted ownership of the studio&#x27;s back catalog; its launch of Cartoon Network on October 1, 1992, provided a new audience for Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers cartoons, both old and new.

In 1989, producer Tom Ruegger had led an exodus of Hanna-Barbera staffers to restart Warner Bros. Animation. At first, the studio was constantly under threat of closure. However, under Fred Seibert&#x27;s guidance, Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s new staff (whose ranks included Craig McCracken, Genndy Tartakovsky, Butch Hartman and Seth MacFarlane) created a new generation of Hanna-Barbera cartoons in the 1990s such as &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;I Am Weasel&quot; and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. Alongside these Hanna-Barbera cartoons, shows from other companies also premiered on the channel such as &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; and &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;.

Time Warner acquired Turner in 1996, and thus inherited the rights to all of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s creative properties. This allowed Cartoon Network to begin airing all of the classic &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts as well (previously, Turner had owned only the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts produced before August 1948, which had become part of the MGM/UA library). Cartoon Network&#x27;s success with original programming lead them to move the reruns of old Hanna-Barbera and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons to their spin-off channel Boomerang.

In 1997, Fred Seibert left Hanna-Barbera to found his studio. In 1998, Hanna-Barbera moved to the same building as Warner Bros. Animation; the use of the Hanna-Barbera name for new productions ended with William Hanna&#x27;s death in 2001. Hanna and Barbera continued to work as Time Warner employees and consultants until their respective deaths in 2001 and 2006; the name is still used for productions based on properties created during the Hanna-Barbera era. Cartoon Network Studios now handles most original animation for the network.

===Nickelodeon===
In 1991, Nickelodeon introduced &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; as the first of three installments in Nicktoons brand. &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; was a wild and off-beat series that violated all the restrictions of Saturday morning cartoons, instead favoring the outrageous style of the shorts from the Golden Age period. The series&#x27; creator, John Kricfalusi—a Ralph Bakshi protege—was largely influenced by the classic works of Bob Clampett. Despite the show&#x27;s popularity, the show was beset with production delays and censorship battles with Nickelodeon, which fired Kricfalusi in 1992. The show continued under the production of the network-owned Games Animation company until 1996, though many animators departed with Kricfalusi. TNN revived the show in a more risqué form in 2003, with Kricfalusi receiving more creative freedom, but it only lasted ten episodes.

From the early 1990s to the late 2000s, Nickelodeon also gave birth to many other hit animated series such as &quot;Doug&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;KaBlam!&quot;, &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;CatDog&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot;, &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Many of these shows spawned successful multimedia franchises, most notably &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (both franchises having three theatrical films and TV movies), and &quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender&quot; (which garnered both a sequel series and a ).

===Disney Channel===
Disney had hit animated series from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s such as &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; (1985), &quot;DuckTales&quot; (1987), &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; (1989), &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991), and &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1994). These aired on syndication, the Disney Afternoon programming block, and the Disney Channel (at the time a pay-cable channel).

Further successful cartoons appeared in the late 1990s to early 2000s with &quot;Recess&quot; (1997), &quot;The Proud Family&quot; (2001), and &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2002), airing on Disney Channel (which switched to basic cable in 1997) and ABC&#x27;s One Saturday Morning (later ABC Kids). Around the same time, Disney launched Toon Disney, a channel specifically intended for animation.

Disney continued launching successful cartoon series in the late 2000s to 2020s, such as &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot;, the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot, &quot;Big City Greens&quot;, &quot;Amphibia&quot;, &quot;The Owl House&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost and Molly McGee&quot;. Toon Disney rebranded to Disney XD; cartoons continued airing there, as well as on Disney Channel and Disney&#x27;s streaming platform Disney+.

===Broadcast networks===
Throughout the 1990s, the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) were no longer a three-way oligopoly. On cable TV, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and Disney Channel all grew to a point where they were and are still competitive with the broadcast networks around the world. The fledgling Fox network launched their Fox Kids programming block on weekdays and Saturdays in 1990, while The WB joined the competition with a kid&#x27;s programming block shortly after the network&#x27;s 1995 launch.

When NBC compared the success of the live-action youth sitcom &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; to the paucity of their animated hits, they gave up on cartoons in 1992, instead concentrating on live-action teenage shows with their Saturday-morning TNBC block. ABC was purchased by Disney in 1996, and Disney transformed ABC&#x27;s Saturday schedule into a series of Disney-produced animated cartoons collectively named One Saturday Morning. CBS was simply never able to come up with any new hits once the shows that anchored its late 1980s/early 1990s Saturday morning lineup—&quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, etc.—ran their respective courses. When CBS was purchased by Viacom, which also owned Nickelodeon, Viacom simply repurposed much of the Nick Jr. lineup—in addition to adding a Saturday edition of the CBS morning-news program &quot;The Early Show&quot;.

As a result of years of activism by Action for Children&#x27;s Television and others against shows they believed blurred the line between entertainment and advertising, the Children&#x27;s Television Act was passed in 1990. It began to be strictly enforced in 1996. The Federal Communications Commission began requiring three hours a week of educational and informational program intended explicitly for children, at times when children were awake. Since this required three hours to be &quot;off-limits&quot; to programs aimed at the general public, the networks naturally chose to air them on Saturday morning, when children were already watching. As a result, almost every Saturday-morning network show is required to contain some educational content. Fox and The WB worked around this problem by airing short one-hour weekday children&#x27;s blocks instead of morning news shows, but those weekday blocks no longer exist (with the notable exception of PBS, which continues to have large weekday children&#x27;s programming blocks as of 2010). Nonetheless, there were still a few toy-based children&#x27;s programs in the 1990s, particularly &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

Cable networks were not subject to these—or most other—FCC requirements, which allowed their series to have more leeway with content than network shows. The impact of the new regulations was almost instantaneous: by 1997, Nickelodeon had rocketed past its broadcast competitors to become the most-watched network on Saturday mornings.

==Animation for adults==

The 1990s saw the beginnings of a new wave of animated cartoon series targeted primarily to adults and teenagers, after a lack of such a focus for over a decade.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot; and Fox===
In 1987, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, an animated short cartoon segment of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, debuted. Matt Groening&#x27;s creation gained its own half-hour series in 1989, the first prime-time animated series since &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Although 70 percent of the first episode&#x27;s animation had to be redone, pushing the series premiere back three months, it became one of the first major hit series for the fledgling Fox network. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; caused a sensation, entering popular culture and gaining wide acclaim for its satirical handling of American culture, families, society as a whole, and the human condition.

The show has won dozens of awards, including 24 Emmy Awards, 26 Annie Awards and two Peabody Awards. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century&#x27;s best television series; it had also named character Bart Simpson in &quot;Time&quot; 100: The Most Important People of the Century, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide. On February 26, 2009, Fox renewed &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for an additional two years, &quot;...which will secure its place as TV&#x27;s longest-running prime-time series.&quot; Its 21st season began on September 27, 2009, breaking the 20-season record it once shared with &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; led Fox to develop other animated series aimed at adults, including &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; (created by Loren Bouchard), &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (created by Mike Judge), &quot;Futurama&quot; (also by Groening), &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (all created by Seth MacFarlane). &quot;King of the Hill&quot; was an instant success, running 13 seasons. Both &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; were cancelled by the network; after strong DVD sales and ratings in re-runs, both returned to the air—&quot;Family Guy&quot; on Fox, and &quot;Futurama&quot; on Comedy Central, now Hulu.

===Spike and Mike===
In 1989, a festival of animation shorts, organized by Craig &quot;Spike&quot; Decker and Mike Gribble (known as &quot;Spike &amp; Mike&quot;) and originally based in San Diego, began showcasing a collection of short subject animated films. Known as the &quot;Classic Festival of Animation&quot;, it played in theatrical and non-theatrical venues across the country.

The collections were largely made up of Oscar-nominated shorts, student work from the California Institute of the Arts, and experimental work funded by the National Film Board of Canada. Early festivals included work by John Lasseter, Nick Park, Mike Judge, and Craig McCracken. Judge&#x27;s piece, &quot;Frog Baseball&quot;, marked the first appearance of his dimwitted trademark characters Beavis and Butt-head, while McCracken&#x27;s short &quot;The Whoopass Girls in A Sticky Situation&quot; featured the introduction of the trio of little girl superheroes that would later gain popularity under their new moniker, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

The festival gradually turned into a program of films called &quot;Spike and Mike&#x27;s Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation&quot;, an underground movement for adult humor and subject matter.

===Cartoon Network and Adult Swim===

In 1994, the U.S. cable television network Cartoon Network approved a new series entitled &quot;Space Ghost: Coast to Coast&quot;. In a particularly postmodern twist, this show featured live-action celebrity interviews mixed with animation from the original &quot;Space Ghost&quot; cartoon. It was the beginning of the now common practice of using old Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters for new edgier productions, such as the surrealistic &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, based on the short-lived early 1970s environmentally themed cartoon &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;. &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; was about a lackluster superhero, Birdman—originally the star of &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;—who has become a lawyer. His clientele, as well as most of the other characters on the show, are made up entirely of old Hanna-Barbera characters.

Adult Swim, a scheduling block of adult-oriented cartoons appearing on Cartoon Network beginning after primetime, premiered in 2001. Originally limited to Sunday nights, as of 2018, Adult Swim now remains on the air every night until 6:00 a.m. Eastern time. Animated series produced exclusively for Adult Swim include &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot;, &quot;Stroker and Hoop&quot;, &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; and &quot;Smiling Friends&quot;. In addition to American animation, Adult Swim also runs popular anime series such as &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;, the &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; series, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;InuYasha&quot; and &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;.

===Other cartoons for adults===
Other TV networks also experimented with adult-oriented animation. MTV produced several successful animated series especially for its adolescent and young adult audience, including &quot;Liquid Television&quot;, &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot; (and its spin-off &quot;Daria&quot;), &quot;The Maxx&quot;, and &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;. They would continue experimenting with animated series into the early 2000s with shows such as &quot;Clone High&quot;, &quot;Spy Groove&quot;, and &quot;3-South&quot;. Their original animated programming slowed to a halt by the end of the decade. USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Duckman&quot;, starring the voice of Jason Alexander, found a cult following. Premium cable also experimented with original animated series, such as &quot;Spawn&quot;.

Another successful adult-oriented animated series was Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#x27;s &quot;South Park&quot;, which saw its beginnings in 1995 with the short cartoon &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot;. Like &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; were given the big-screen treatment as &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; and &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut&quot; both of which met with box office success.

Cartoonist Bill Plympton transitioned from print to animation in the late 1980s and has continued to make adult-oriented shorts. Don Hertzfeldt began in animation in the 1990s and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2001 for &quot;Rejected&quot;.

Feature-length films like &quot;Cool World&quot; and &quot;Bebe&#x27;s Kids&quot; helped establish a market for adult animation films.

==The rise of computer animation==
The 1990s saw major growth in the use of computer-generated imagery to enhance both animated sequences and live-action special effects, allowing elaborate computer-animated sequences to dominate both. This new form of animation soon dominated Hollywood special effects; the films &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; included Oscar-winning special effects sequences which made extensive use of CGI. After decades of existing as related but separate industries, the barrier between &quot;animation&quot; and &quot;special effects&quot; was shattered by the popularization of computerized special effects—to the point where computer enhancement of Hollywood feature films became second-nature and often went unnoticed. The Academy Award-winning &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994) depended heavily on computerized special effects to create the illusion of Tom Hanks shaking hands with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and to make Gary Sinise convincingly appear to be a double amputee, winning a special-effects Oscar. The film &quot;Titanic&quot; used computer effects in nearly every scene of its three-hour run time; one of the film&#x27;s 11 Oscars was for visual effects.

While Disney made the film &quot;Tron&quot;—which extensively mixed live-action, traditional animation, and CGI in 1982, and introduced the CAPS system to enhance traditional animation in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, a completely computer-animated feature film had yet to be made. In 1995, Disney partnered with Pixar to produce &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the first computer-animated movie. The film&#x27;s success was so massive that other studios looked into producing their own CGI animated films. Computer-animated films turned out to be wildly popular, and animated films returned the highest gross margins (around 52%) of all film genres in the 2004-2013 timeframe.

Computer animation also made inroads into television. The Saturday morning animated series &quot;ReBoot&quot; won a large cult following among adults; it was the first of several CGI animated series, including &quot;Beast Wars&quot;, &quot;War Planets&quot;, and &quot;Roughnecks&quot;. The quality of the computer animation improved considerably with each successive series. Many live-action TV series (especially science fiction TV series such as &quot;Babylon 5&quot;) invested heavily in CGI production, creating a heretofore-unavailable level of special effects for a relatively low price.

===Pixar===
The most popular and successful competitor in the CGI race. Pixar originated in 1979 when George Lucas&#x27; Lucasfilm was able to recruit Edwin Catmull from the New York Institute of Technology to start the Graphics Group of its special-effects division. In late 1983, Catmull was able to bring in as a freelance independent contractor a Disney animator, John Lasseter, not long after Lasseter (then unbeknownst to Catmull) had been fired by the Walt Disney Company for his vigorous advocacy of computer animation; Lasseter was hired as a full-time employee about a year later.

Lucas experienced cash flow issues after his 1983 divorce, and in 1986 Pixar was spun off from Lucasfilm as a separate corporation with $10 million in capital from Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs. At that time, Pixar primarily developed computer animation hardware, but Lasseter helped the company make a name for itself by creating acclaimed CGI short films such as &quot;The Adventures of André and Wally B.&quot; (1984). After the spin-off, he would go on to produce &quot;Tin Toy&quot; (1988), which won an Oscar. The company transitioned into TV commercial production and projects such as the Computer Animation Production System for Disney. After the success of &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, Pixar made a deal with Disney to produce feature films. The first of these films, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot;, was a smash hit, which in turn led to additional successful films such as &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. By then, Jobs had become the owner of Pixar by keeping it alive with additional investments over the years; he had often considered selling it but changed his mind after &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

Pixar&#x27;s string of critical and box-office successes continued with &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, &quot;WALL-E&quot;, &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; all receiving rave reviews, earning huge profits, winning awards, and overshadowing Disney&#x27;s in-house offerings until &quot;Cars 2&quot; in 2011 ended the streak when it proved a critical disappointment, albeit still a commercial success. Disney produced a CGI/live-action feature film of its own without Pixar (&quot;Dinosaur&quot;), but the film received a mixed reaction, even though it was a financial success. During the later years of Michael Eisner&#x27;s management, friction between Disney and Pixar grew to the point where Pixar considered finding another partner when they could not reach an agreement over profit sharing. When Eisner stepped down in 2005, his replacement, Robert Iger, arranged for Disney to buy Pixar in a $7.4 billion all-stock deal ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) that turned Steve Jobs into Disney&#x27;s largest individual shareholder. The deal was structured so that Disney Animation and Pixar Animation would continue to operate as completely separate studios under the Disney corporate umbrella; Lasseter was placed in charge of greenlighting all-new animated films for both studios in his new role as Chief Creative Officer, a position he had held for 12 years.

===DreamWorks Animation===
When Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney to become a co-partner of Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in the new studio DreamWorks Pictures, the studio naturally became interested in animation. Its first film, &quot;Antz&quot;, did not do as well as the Disney-Pixar releases but was a critical success. However, DreamWorks succeeded in its partnership with the British stop motion animation studio Aardman Animations with &quot;Chicken Run&quot; in 2000, and later the Oscar-winning &quot;Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; in 2006.

Furthermore, DreamWorks finally had success in 2001 with the computer-animated feature film &quot;Shrek&quot;, a gigantic box-office hit that overpowered Disney&#x27;s summer release for that year, &quot;&quot;. After winning the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, &quot;Shrek&quot; established DreamWorks as Pixar&#x27;s first major competitor in CGI animation. DreamWorks&#x27; commercial success continued with three &quot;Shrek&quot; sequels, &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, &quot;Megamind&quot;, &quot;The Croods&quot;, &quot;The Boss Baby&quot; and &quot;Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken&quot;. DreamWorks Animation eventually became a separate company from its parent; it is now owned by Universal Studios through its parent company NBCUniversal/Comcast as of 2024.

===Walt Disney Animation Studios===
In 2003, noting the growing success of studios that relied on computer animation, including Pixar, Blue Sky Studios and DreamWorks Animation, Walt Disney Feature Animation announced it would be converted into a CGI studio.

Two years later, &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, the first computer-animated film from the studio, was released to moderate success at the box office and mixed critical reception. On January 24, 2006, Disney announced that it would be acquiring Pixar (the deal successfully closed that May), and as part of the acquisition, executives Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter assumed control of Walt Disney Feature Animation as President and Chief Creative Officer, respectively. Lasseter later acknowledged that there had been discussions back in 2006 about closing Feature Animation as redundant since Disney now owned Pixar, which he and Catmull flatly rejected (&quot;Not on our watch. We will never allow that to happen.&quot;); they resolved to try to save Walt Disney&#x27;s creative legacy by bringing his animation studio &quot;back up to the creative level it had to be&quot;.

To maintain the separateness of Disney and Pixar (even though they share common ownership and senior management), it was outlined that each studio is to remain solely responsible for its own projects and is not allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.

In 2007, the studio released &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;, which experienced a poor response at the box office despite the lukewarm critical and audience reception. The following film, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Bolt&quot;, had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and became a moderate success, receiving an Academy Award nomination. An adaptation of the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Rapunzel&quot; tale entitled &quot;Tangled&quot; was released in 2010, earning $591 million in worldwide box office revenue, and signified a return by the studio to fairytale-based features common in the traditional animation era. This trend was followed in 2013&#x27;s global blockbuster hit &quot;Frozen&quot;, a film inspired by Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; tale, which released to widespread acclaim and was the first Disney animated film to earn over $1 billion in worldwide box office revenue surpassing Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;. &quot;Frozen&quot; also became the first film from Walt Disney Animation Studios to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. They also had critical and commercial success with Oscar winners &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, &quot;Zootopia&quot; and &quot;Encanto&quot; alongside (following in Pixar&#x27;s footsteps) their own animated shorts &quot;Feast&quot; and &quot;Paperman&quot;; the latter was shown before &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;.

===Independents and others===
Other studios attempted to get into the CGI game. After Don Bluth left 20th Century Fox in 2001, the company released its first computer-animated feature, a hugely successful CGI-animated feature in early 2002 entitled &quot;Ice Age&quot;, as the first full-length feature film under Blue Sky Studios. In 2001, Paramount offered &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, TWC offered &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; in 2005, and Columbia produced &quot;Open Season&quot; in 2006. Warner Brothers had a major success in 2006 with the Oscar-winning film, &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, while Sony produced films under Sony Pictures Animation including &quot;Open Season&quot; in 2006, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; in 2007, and the successful film franchises &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot; and &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; which began in 2009 and 2012, respectively. Universal Studios attempted several times to become a viable participant in the market, finally achieving the goal in 2010 with &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, the first feature film from Illumination Entertainment which provided more hits for them within the following decade. In 2013, Dallas, Texas–based Reel FX released their first feature film Free Birds, which was a moderate success, a year later, they released &quot;The Book of Life&quot; which was a huge success and was nominated for a golden globe for best animated feature.

Despite all its success, computer animation still relies on cartoon and stylized characters. 2001 saw the first attempt to create a fully animated world using photorealistic human actors in &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, which met with moderate critical success but did not do well at the box office.

In 2004, the live-action film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; was released. It was notable for being filmed entirely in front of a bluescreen, with the background being completely computer-generated; only the actors and some props were real. Robert Zemeckis&#x27; film &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, starring Tom Hanks in five roles, was completely CGI animation but used performance capture technology to animate the characters. Zemeckis followed &quot;The Polar Express&quot; with two other motion capture films: &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

The use of CGI special effects in live-action film increased to the point where George Lucas considered his 2002 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; to be primarily an animated film that used real-life actors. A growing number of family-oriented films began to use entirely computer-generated characters that interacted on the screen with live-action counterparts, such as Jar-Jar Binks in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, Gollum in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and the title character of &quot;Hulk&quot;. While computer-generated characters have become acceptable to moviegoers, there have yet to be any fully animated films featuring virtual human actors, or &quot;synthespians&quot;.

==Rise of Internet and Flash animation==

The late 1990s saw the rise of Flash animation—animated films created using the Adobe Flash animation software—produced in the U.S. and elsewhere, and distributed through the Internet.

Some popular Flash animated cartoons include &quot;Joe Cartoons&quot;, &quot;Weebl and Bob&quot;, &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot;, &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, the &quot;Brackenwood&quot; series, &quot;Making Fiends&quot; and &quot;Salad Fingers&quot;.

==Animation accolades==

===Recognition by the Oscars===
Historically, despite the continuation of the Best Animated Short Subject category, animated films seldom received much recognition from the Academy Awards for anything other than musical scores and songs. The unprecedented nomination of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for Best Picture and five other awards changed things, even though it won two Oscars for its song and score while &quot;Toy Story&quot; became the animated film for Best Original Screenplay. Animation had become so widely accepted by the beginning of the 21st century that, in 2001, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences introduced a new Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

The three contenders for the award were: &quot;Shrek&quot;, by DreamWorks, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, by Disney/Pixar, and &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, by Nickelodeon and Paramount. The award that year went to &quot;Shrek&quot;. Films that year which were passed up included the acclaimed adult-oriented film &quot;Waking Life&quot; and the photorealistic CGI film &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;.

Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Spirited Away&quot; won the Oscar in 2002. Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; received the 2003 award, defeating nominees &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot; and &quot;Brother Bear&quot;. Since then, Pixar has won the most awards in this category with the current exceptions being &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; in 2005, &quot;Happy Feet&quot; in 2006, &quot;Rango&quot; in 2011, &quot;Frozen&quot; in 2013, &quot;Big Hero 6&quot; in 2014, &quot;Zootopia&quot; in 2016, &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; in 2018, &quot;Encanto&quot; in 2021, &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Pinocchio&quot; in 2022 and &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; in 2023.

In 2013, the March 7 issue of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; magazine published the ballots of eight different Oscar voters in the Academy. Of those eight, four voters abstained in the Best Animated Feature category due to inadequate knowledge of the subject. They admitted to not having seen all of the nominations, with one person stating &quot;that ended when I was 6.&quot; Such disregard for animated films by the voters themselves is often criticized by American animators, who claim that &quot;Hollywood doesn&#x27;t care or know the first thing about animated films.&quot;

===Annie Awards===

The Annie Awards are presented each February by the Hollywood branch of the International Animated Film Association for achievements in the fields of film and television animation in the United States. Originally formed in 1972 to celebrate lifetime contributions to the various fields within animation, the awards started to honor animation as a whole, including current offerings.

==Legacy==
Seven animated features, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) and &quot;Wall-E&quot; (2008) plus two animated shorts from Pixar &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; (1986) and &quot;Tin Toy&quot; (1988), were each inducted into the National Film Registry.

Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001) and four Pixar films (2003&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Wall-E&quot; and 2015&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out&quot;) were included on BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century poll.

<text>Henri Christophe (; 6 October 1767 – 8 October 1820) was a key leader in the Haitian Revolution and the only monarch of the Kingdom of Haiti.

Born in the British Caribbean, Christophe was possibly of Senegambian descent. Beginning with the slave uprising of 1791, he rose to power in the ranks of the Haitian revolutionary military. The revolution succeeded in gaining independence from France in 1804. In 1805 he took part under Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the capture of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic), against French forces who acquired the colony from Spain in the Treaty of Basel.

After Dessalines was assassinated, Christophe retreated to the Plaine-du-Nord and created a separate government. On 17 February 1807, he was elected president of the State of Haiti, as he named that area. Alexandre Pétion was elected president of the Republic of Haiti in the south. On 26 March 1811, Christophe created a kingdom in the north and was later proclaimed Henry I, King of Haïti. He also created a nobility and named his legitimate son Jacques-Victor Henry as prince and heir.

He is known for constructing Citadel Henry, now known as Citadelle Laferrière, the Sans-Souci Palace, the royal chapel of Milot, the Palais de la Belle Rivière and numerous other palaces. Under his policies of corvée, or forced labor bordering on slavery, the Kingdom earned revenues from agricultural production, primarily sugar, but the Haitian people resented the system. He reached an agreement with the United Kingdom to respect its Caribbean colonies in exchange for their warnings to his government of any French naval activity threatening Haiti. In 1820, unpopular, ill and fearing a coup, he committed suicide. Jacques-Victor, his son and heir, was assassinated 10 days later. Afterwards, General Jean-Pierre Boyer came to power and reunited the two parts of Haiti.

==Early life==
Claims about Henri Christophe&#x27;s place of birth and life before coming to prominence have been contested since the early nineteenth century. Born Christophe Henry, probably in Grenada but perhaps St Kitts the son of a slave mother and Christophe, a freeman, he was brought as a slave to the northern part of Saint-Domingue. In 1779 he may have served with the French forces as a drummer boy in the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue, a regiment composed of gens de couleur libres (mixed-race residents of Saint-Domingue), and fewer black residents. The regiment fought at the Siege of Savannah, a battle during the American Revolutionary War. It is claimed that Christophe was wounded in this battle.

As an adult, Christophe may have worked as a mason, sailor, stable hand, waiter, or billiard marker; if so, most of his pay would have gone to his master. One popular story claims that he worked in and managed &quot;La Couronne&quot;, a hotel restaurant in Cap-Français, the first capital of the French colony of Saint-Domingue and a major colonial city. There, the legend goes, he became skilled at dealing with the &quot;grand blancs,&quot; as the wealthy white French planters were called. However, none of the hotel&#x27;s sales records support this claim. He was said to have gained his freedom from slavery as a young man, before the slave uprising of 1791. On 15 July 1793 he married Marie-Louise Coidavid, a member of the free black community of Cap-Français. The political skills he learned as a hotelier also served him well when he later became an officer in the military and leader in the country.

Beginning with the slave uprising of 1791, Christophe distinguished himself as a soldier in the Haitian Revolution and quickly rose to be a colonel during the revolutionary years. He fought for years with Toussaint Louverture in the north, participating in numerous battles during the revolution, and eventually rising to the rank of commander-in-chief at Cap-Français. By 1801, Louverture had promoted him to brigadier-general.

==Independent Haiti==
The French deported Toussaint Louverture to France, and brought in more than 20,000 new troops under the Vicomte de Rochambeau in an effort to regain control of the colony and re-establish slavery. Jean Jacques Dessalines led the fight to defeat the French forces. The French withdrew their 7,000 surviving troops in late 1803. As leader, Dessalines declared the independence of Saint-Domingue with its new name of Haïti in 1804.

Christophe was in charge of the northern section of the country, where he notably supervised the first steps of the construction of Citadelle Laferrière. In 1805, General Nicolas Geffrard, commander in the south, approached Christophe with a plot to kill Dessalines, the self-proclaimed emperor of Haiti; Christophe did not warn Dessalines. Christophe&#x27;s influence and power in the north was such that Dessalines, though aware of opposition brewing against him in the highest circles of power, found himself unable to strike against his general. The conspiracy involved the majority of Dessalines&#x27;s senior officers, including his minister of war and navy Étienne Élie Gerin, General Alexandre Pétion, commander-in-chief of the second division in the west, General Nicolas Geffrard and many others. On 16 October 1806, they signed a proclamation entitled &quot;Resistance to Oppression&quot;, declaring the necessity to overthrow Dessalines&#x27;s government, and proclaimed Christophe head of the provisional Haitian government. Dessalines was assassinated on 17 October 1806.

==Failed military invasion of 1805==

In 1805, French troops were still posted on the eastern part of the island (mainly in Santo Domingo), where they were led by the French officer Marie-Louis Ferrand. He mobilized his troops and ordered them to seize all black children of both sexes below the age of 14 years to be sold as slaves. Learning of this action, Dessalines said he was outraged, and decided to use this a pretext to invade Santo Domingo, with his forces looting several towns, such as Azua and Moca, and finally laying siege to the city of Santo Domingo, the stronghold of the French.

Henry Christophe (referred to as Enrique Cristóbal in Spanish-language accounts), under Dessalines, attacked the towns of Moca and Santiago. The barrister Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo wrote, &quot;40 children had their throats cut at the Moca&#x27;s church, and the bodies found at the presbytery, which is the space that encircles the church&#x27;s altar...&quot; This event was one of several documented accounts of atrocities perpetrated by General Christophe under the orders of Dessalines; they retreated from the Spanish-speaking side of the island after their failed invasion attempt.

On 6 April 1805, having gathered all his troops, General Christophe took all male prisoners to the local cemetery and proceeded to slit their throats, among them Presbyter Vásquez and 20 more priests. Later he set on fire the whole town along with its five churches. On his way out he took along, fashioned like a herd, 249 women, 430 girls and 318 boys, a steep figure considering the relatively low population of the town at that time. Alejandro Llenas wrote that Christophe took 997 from Santiago alone, and &quot;Monte Plata, San Pedro and Cotuí were reduced to ashes, and their residents either had their throats slit or were taken captives by the thousands, like farm animals, tied up and getting beaten on their way to Haiti.&quot;

Before leaving Santo Domingo, Dessalines &quot;gave the order to... commanders posted in conquered communities, to round up all dwellers and subdue them to prison, and thus, at first command, have them stomped by mules and other beasts upon arriving to the Haitian side.&quot;

==State and Kingdom of Haiti==
Following a power struggle with Pétion and his supporters in the south, Christophe retreated with his followers to the Plaine-du-Nord of Haiti, the stronghold of former slaves, and created a separate government there. Christophe suspected he was also at risk of assassination in the south. In 1807, he declared himself &quot;&quot;président et généralissime des forces de terre et de mer de l&#x27;État d&#x27;Haïti&quot;&#x27;&quot; (English: President and Generalissimo of the armies of land and sea of the State of Haïti). Pétion became President of the &quot;Republic of Haïti&quot; in the south, where he was backed by General Jean-Pierre Boyer, a &quot;personne de couleur&quot; who controlled the southern armies.

In 1811, Christophe declared the northern state of Haïti a kingdom and had himself crowned by Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Brelle, the archbishop of Milot. The 1 April 1811 edict gave his full title as

He renamed Cap-Français as &quot;Cap-Henry&quot; (later renamed as Cap-Haïtien).

Christophe named his legitimate son Jacques-Victor Henry heir apparent, giving him the title of Prince Royal of Haïti. His second son was a colonel in his army.

Christophe built six châteaux, eight palaces and the massive Citadelle Laferrière, on a mountain near Milot. With the remains of the Sans-Souci Palace, it has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nine years later, at the end of his monarchy, Henry increased the number of designated nobility from the original 87 to 134.

The two parts of Haiti struggled to increase agricultural production to recover from the expensive and damaging wars. The United States had only recently ended its arms and goods embargo against Haiti, and began war with United Kingdom in the War of 1812. Christophe had to choose whether to enforce a version of the slave plantation system to increase agricultural production, or to subdivide the land into parcels for peasants&#x27; subsistence farming. The latter was the policy of President Pétion in the south. King Henry chose to enforce &quot;corvée&quot; plantation work, a system of forced labor, in lieu of taxes, but also began his massive building projects. During his reign, Northern Haiti was despotic, but the sugar cane economy generated revenue for government and officials.

He made an agreement with Britain that Haiti would not threaten its Caribbean colonies; in return, the Royal Navy would warn Haiti of imminent attacks from French troops. In 1807, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Slave Trade Act 1807 to abolish the importation of slaves into the British Empire. Because of increased bilateral trade with Britain, Christophe&#x27;s government earned an enormous sum of British pounds for his treasury. By contrast, Petion&#x27;s southern Haiti became much poorer because the land-share system reduced agricultural productivity, and exports fell.

==Nobility and heraldry==
As king, Christophe created an elaborate Haitian peerage (nobility), originally consisting of four princes, eight dukes, 22 counts, 40 barons, and 14 knights (&quot;chevaliers&quot;). Christophe founded a College of Arms to provide armorial bearings for the newly ennobled. For his personal coat of arms, Christophe chose a crowned phoenix rising from flames, and the motto ‘&quot;Je renais de mes cendres’&quot; (‘I rise from my ashes’), presumably referring to the rebirth of Cap Henry after he burned it in 1802 to repel the invading French army.

Some Europeans mocked his creation. The titles of the &quot;Duc de Limonade&quot; (Julien Prévost, Christophe&#x27;s secretary of state) and &quot;Duc de Marmelade&quot; (Jean-Pierre Richard, governor of Cap Henry) were considered particularly comic by those unaware that they were actually derived from place names given by the previous French colonists.

== French attempt to regain Haiti ==
After Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, King Louis XVIII attempted to take back St Domingue. The Treaty of Paris, ratified on 30 May, gave neighboring Santo Domingo back to Spain, and granted an extra five years of slave trade in which to recoup losses entailed by abolition of slavery. In October 1814, Henry I&#x27;s ministers made public evidence of French schemes to try and recover its former colony, in the form of letters carried by French agents captured on the island. In the ensuing uproar, the nation mobilized for the expected French invasion and began an international public relations campaign. From November on, reprints of Haitian pamphlets, newspapers and open letters appeared in print media across the Atlantic world. Such broadsides and editorial interventions were accompanied by critical theoretical texts on race and colonialism such as Pompée Valentin Vastey&#x27;s &quot;The Colonial System Unveiled&quot; (&quot;Le Système colonial dévoilé&quot;). Simultaneously, Henry opened up communication with the most prominent English abolitionists: his letter to William Wilberforce arrived on 5 January 1815, and began a new level of engagement between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Haiti.

==End of reign==

Despite promoting education and establishing a legal system called the &quot;Code Henry&quot;, King Henry was an unpopular, autocratic monarch. His realm was constantly challenged by Petion&#x27;s government of the south, in which &quot;gens de couleur&quot; held power. Toward the end of Christophe&#x27;s reign, public sentiment opposed what many considered his feudal policies of forced labor, which he intended to use to develop the country. Ill and infirm at age fifty-three, King Henry died by suicide by shooting himself with a silver bullet rather than risk a coup and assassination. His son and heir was assassinated 10 days later. He was buried within the Citadelle Laferrière.

His descendants continued to be among the powerful of Haiti. Pierre Nord Alexis, President of Haiti from 1902 to 1908, was Christophe&#x27;s grandson.

Michèle Bennett, who married Jean-Claude Duvalier and was First Lady of Haiti during his administration (1980 to 1986), is Christophe&#x27;s great-great-great-granddaughter.

<text>Boulogne-Billancourt (; often colloquially called simply Boulogne, until 1924 Boulogne-sur-Seine, ) is a wealthy and prestigious commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France, located from the centre of Paris. It is a subprefecture of the Hauts-de-Seine department and thus the seat of the larger arrondissement of Boulogne-Billancourt. It is also part of the Métropole du Grand Paris. Boulogne-Billancourt includes one island in the Seine: Île Seguin. 

Boulogne-Billancourt is one of the wealthiest regions in the Parisian area and in France. Formerly an important industrial site, it has successfully reconverted into business services and is now home to major communication companies headquartered in the Val de Seine business district.

==Etymology==
The original name of the commune was Boulogne-sur-Seine (meaning &quot;Boulogne upon Seine&quot;).

Before the 14th century, Boulogne was a small village called &quot;Menuls-lès-Saint-Cloud&quot; (meaning &quot;Menuls near Saint-Cloud&quot;). In the beginning of the 14th century, King Philip IV of France ordered the building in &quot;Menuls-lès-Saint-Cloud&quot; of a church dedicated to the virgin of the sanctuary of Boulogne-sur-Mer, then a famous pilgrimage center in northern France. The church, meant to become a pilgrimage centre closer to Paris than the distant city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, was named Notre-Dame de Boulogne la Petite (&quot;Our Lady of Boulogne the Minor&quot;). Gradually, the village of &quot;Menuls-lès-Saint-Cloud&quot; became known as &quot;Boulogne-la-Petite&quot;, and later as &quot;Boulogne-sur-Seine&quot;.

In 1924, &quot;Boulogne-sur-Seine&quot; was officially renamed Boulogne-Billancourt to reflect the development of the industrial neighbourhood of Billancourt annexed in 1860.

As for the name Billancourt, it was recorded for the first time in 1150 as &quot;Bullencort&quot;, sometimes also spelled &quot;Bollencort&quot;. It comes from Medieval Latin &quot;cortem&quot;, accusative of &quot;cors&quot;, meaning &quot;enclosure&quot;, &quot;estate&quot;, suffixed to the Germanic patronym Buolo (meaning &quot;friend, brother, kinsman&quot;), thus having the meaning of &quot;estate of Buolo&quot;.

==History==

On 1 January 1860, the City of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, the communes of Auteuil and Passy were disbanded and divided between Boulogne-Billancourt (then called &quot;Boulogne-sur-Seine&quot;) and the city of Paris. &quot;Boulogne-sur-Seine&quot; received a small part of the territory of Passy, and about half of the territory of Auteuil (including the area of Billancourt, which belonged to the disbanded commune of Auteuil).

Some of the competitive shooting events of the 1900 Summer Olympics took place in Boulogne-Billancourt.

In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne, which was hitherto divided between the communes of Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine, was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris. On that occasion, Boulogne-Billancourt, to which most of the Bois de Boulogne belonged, lost about half of its territory. Since then, Boulogne-Billancourt has been surrounded to the west, south and east by the Seine and to the north and north-east by the 16th arrondissement of Paris.

Boulogne-Billancourt is known for being the birthplace of three major French industries. It was the location, in 1906 for the very first aircraft factory, that of Appareils d&#x27;Aviation Les Frères Voisin, which was then followed by those of many other aviation pioneers, and the tradition continues with several aviation related companies still operating in the area.

The automobile industry had a large presence with Renault on Île Seguin, as well as Salmson building both cars and aircraft engines. Finally, the French film industry started here and, from 1922 to 1992 it was the home of the Billancourt Studios, and since becoming a major location for French film production. It was used as the setting of the TV show &quot;Code Lyoko&quot;.

==Demographics==
== Urbanism ==

* The ecologic neighbourhood of the &quot;Trapèze&quot; in Boulogne-Billancourt: the district stands on 74 hectares and will be able to house up to 18,000 inhabitants at the end of its construction. 65% of the district&#x27;s energy is brought by geothermal power, which heats and freshens the buildings. Solar panels and a vegetable greenhouse were installed in the aim to link the district to sustainable energies. Bicycle and &quot;soft&quot; travels will of course be put first to reduce the pollution caused by cars, as well as other vehicles which do not run on electricity.
* The Ambroise Paré Hospital is located in the city.

==Administration==
With the city of Sèvres, Boulogne-Billancourt is part of the Val de Seine.

==Transport==
Boulogne-Billancourt is served by two stations on Paris Métro Line 10: Boulogne–Jean Jaurès and Boulogne–Pont de Saint-Cloud. It is also served by three stations on Paris Métro Line 9: Marcel Sembat, Billancourt and Pont de Sèvres.

==Politics==

<text>The Southern Alps (; officially Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the range&#x27;s western side. The name &quot;Southern Alps&quot; generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

The range includes the South Island&#x27;s Main Divide, which separates the water catchments of the more heavily populated eastern side of the island from those on the west coast. Politically, the Main Divide forms the boundary between the Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago regions to the southeast and the Tasman and West Coast regions to the northwest.

==Names==
The Māori name of the range is , meaning &quot;the Mirage of the Ocean&quot;.

The English explorer James Cook bestowed the name &quot;Southern Alps&quot; on 23 March 1770, admiring their &quot;prodigious height&quot;. They had previously been noted by Abel Tasman in 1642, whose description of the South Island&#x27;s west coast is often translated as &quot;a land uplifted high&quot;.

Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the official name of the range was updated to &quot;Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana&quot;.

==Geography==

The Southern Alps run approximately 500 km northeast to southwest. Its tallest peak is Aoraki / Mount Cook, the highest point in New Zealand at . The Southern Alps include sixteen other points that exceed in height (see NZ mountains by height). The mountain ranges are bisected by glacial valleys, many of which are infilled with glacial lakes on the eastern side including Lake Coleridge in the north and Lake Wakatipu in Otago in the south. According to an inventory conducted in the late 1970s, the Southern Alps contained over 3,000 glaciers larger than one hectare, the longest of which – the Tasman Glacier – is in length which has retreated from a recent maximum of in the 1960s.

Settlements include Maruia Springs, a spa near Lewis Pass, the town of Arthur&#x27;s Pass, and Mount Cook Village.

Major crossings of the Southern Alps in the New Zealand road network include Lewis Pass (), Arthur&#x27;s Pass (), Haast Pass (), and the road to Milford Sound ().

===Climate===
New Zealand has a humid maritime, temperate climate with the Southern Alps lying perpendicular to the prevailing westerly flow of air. Annual precipitation varies greatly across the range, from at the West Coast, close to the Main Divide, to east of the Main Divide. This high precipitation aids the growth of glaciers above the snow line. Large glaciers and snowfields can be found west of or on the Main Divide, with smaller glaciers farther east (See Glaciers of New Zealand).

Because of its orientation perpendicular to the prevailing westerly winds, the range creates excellent wave soaring conditions for glider pilots. The town of Omarama, in the lee of the mountains, has gained an international reputation for its gliding conditions. The prevailing westerlies also create a weather pattern known as the &quot;Nor&#x27;west arch&quot;, in which moist air is pushed up over the mountains, forming an arch of cloud in an otherwise blue sky. This weather pattern is frequently visible in summer across Canterbury and North Otago. The &#x27;Nor&#x27;wester&#x27; is a foehn wind similar to the Chinook of Canada, where mountain ranges in the path of prevailing moisture laden winds force air upwards, thus cooling the air and condensing the moisture to rain, producing hot dry winds in the descending air lee of the mountains.

==Geology==

The Southern Alps lie along a geological plate boundary, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, with the Pacific Plate to the southeast pushing westward and colliding with the northward-moving Indo-Australian Plate to the northwest. Over the last 45 million years, the collision has pushed up a 20 km thickness of rocks on the Pacific Plate to form the Alps, although much of this has been eroded away. Uplift has been most rapid during the last 5 million years, and the mountains continue to be raised today by tectonic pressure, causing earthquakes on the Alpine Fault and other nearby faults. Despite the substantial uplift, most of the relative motion along the Alpine Fault is transverse, not vertical. However, significant dip-slip occurs on the plate boundary to the north and east of the North Island, in the Hikurangi Trough and Kermadec Trench. The transfer of motion from strike-slip on the Alpine Fault to dip-slip motion at these subduction zones to the north creates the Marlborough Fault System, which has resulted in significant uplift in the region.

In 2017 a large international team of scientists reported they had discovered beneath Whataroa, a small township on the Alpine Fault, &quot;extreme&quot; hydrothermal activity which &quot;could be commercially very significant&quot;.

==Flora==

The mountains are rich in flora with about 25% of the country&#x27;s plant species being found above the treeline in alpine plant habitats and grassland with mountain beech forest at lower elevations (of the eastern side but not in Westland). The cold windswept slopes above the treeline are covered with areas of fellfield. To the east, the Alps descend to the Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands. Plants adapted to the alpine conditions include woody shrubs like &quot;Hebe&quot;, &quot;Dracophyllum&quot;, and &quot;Coprosma&quot;, the conifer snow totara &quot;(Podocarpus nivalis)&quot; and &quot;Carex&quot; sedge grasses.

==Fauna==
Wildlife of the mountains includes the endemic rock wren &quot;(Xenicus gilviventris)&quot;. There are also a number of endemic insects adapted to these high altitudes, like flies, moths, beetles, bees, and the mountain stone wētā, which can freeze solid over winter to survive the alpine conditions. The beech forests of the lower elevations are important habitat for several birds, such as the great spotted kiwi &quot;(Apteryx haastii)&quot;, the South Island kākā &quot;(Nestor meridionalis meridionalis)&quot;, and the orange-fronted kākāriki &quot;(Cyanoramphus malherbi)&quot;. The kea can be found in the forested foothills as well as higher, colder elevations. It is the world&#x27;s only alpine parrot, and was once hunted as a pest.

==Threats and preservation==
The mountains are inaccessible and retain their natural vegetation. A large proportion of the range is well protected by national parks—notably the Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Mount Aspiring National Park, and Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park—or by protected areas such as Lake Sumner Forest Park. Indigenous plant life is affected by introduced animals such as red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), chamois (&quot;Rupicapra rupicapra&quot;), and Himalayan tahr (&quot;Hemitragus jemlahicus&quot;), all of which have at times been targeted for culling. Likewise, native birds and reptiles are vulnerable to introduced predators.
