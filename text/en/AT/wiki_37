<text>Clan Ross ( ) is a Highland Scottish clan. The original chiefs of the clan were the original Earls of Ross.

==History==

===Origins===

The first recorded chief of the Clan Ross was &quot;Fearcher Mac an t-Sagairt&quot; which in English meant &quot;son of the priest&quot; alluding to his Ó Beólláin descent from the hereditary Abbots of Applecross. Fearchar helped King Alexander II of Scotland (1214–1249) crush a rebellion by Donald Bane, a rival claimant to the Scottish throne. Fearchar was knighted by the king and by 1234 he was officially recognized with the title of Earl of Ross.

The Earl&#x27;s son, William was abducted in about 1250 in a revolt against the Earl&#x27;s rule. However, he was rescued with help from the Munros who were rewarded with lands and who became closely connected with their powerful benefactors.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===

During the Wars of Scottish Independence the Clan Ross fought against the English at the Battle of Dunbar (1296) where their chief, the Earl of Ross was captured. This meant that for a short time William II, Earl of Ross sided with the English but he later supported Robert the Bruce of Scotland. The Clan Ross fought alongside King Robert the Bruce when Earl Fearchar&#x27;s grandson William led the clan against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Hugh, Earl of Ross, was killed at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333.

===15th century and clan conflicts===

William III, Earl of Ross (6th Earl of Ross) died without male issue. The earldom of Ross and the chiefship of Clan Ross were then separated. The chiefship of the Clan Ross passed to Earl William&#x27;s brother Hugh Ross of Rariches (1st of Balnagown), who was granted a charter, in 1374, for the lands of Balnagowan. The earldom of Ross passed through a female line, and that later led to dispute between two rival claimants—the Lord of the Isles and the Duke of Albany. This resulted in the Battle of Harlaw in 1411 where the Clan Ross fought with the Highlanders in support of the Lord of the Isles against an army led by the Earl of Mar under the urging of Robert, Duke of Albany. They were successful in defeating Mar. 

The Rosses took part in the Battle of Verneuil 1424, against the English in France. On the death of the Earl of Buchan and Ross at that battle, James I claimed Earldom of Ross for himself though the rightful claim to the title was in Alexander of Islay, Lord of the Isles. James I eventually restored the earldom to the heiress of line, Mariota, Countess of Ross, the mother of Alexander of Islay, Lord of the Isles who became the Earl of Ross.

In the late 15th century the Clan Mackay and Clan Ross had long been at feud. This resulted in the Battle of Tarbat in 1486 where the Mackays were defeated by the Rosses and the Mackay chief was killed. This was followed by the Battle of Aldy Charrish where the Rosses were defeated by the Mackays and the Ross chief was killed along with many of his clan. According to 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon, who was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, the Clan Sutherland joined the side of the Clan Mackay at this battle. However 19th-century historian Angus Mackay disputes the Sutherland&#x27;s presence at the battle stating that it would be unlikely that the Earl of Sutherland at the time would have assisted against the Rosses as he was married to a daughter of the Ross chief of Balnagowan, and also that the feudal superiority of the Sutherlands over the Mackays &quot;nowhere existed save in his own fertile imagination&quot;.

In 1496, the King summoned chiefs David Ross and Iye Roy Mackay. He ordered them to appear before the Earl of Argyll who was then the Lord High Chancellor of Scotland and make peace, on the understanding that should they not be peaceful that they would be fined 500 merks. The Mackays continued to raid the Rosses and it would appear the civil authority was too feeble to stop them. However the Mackays soon became involved in feuding with the Clan Sutherland and raids on the Rosses did not continue.

===16th century and Anglo-Scottish Wars===

&quot;The Calendar of Fearn&quot; which is a manuscript of the Clan Ross records a Hugh Ross, some time cadet of the Rosses of Balnagowan, who was killed at the Battle of Achnashellach in 1504/05. Contemporary documents, the &quot;Munro Writs&quot; show that he was a procurator for William Munro, 12th Baron of Foulis who led the royal forces at this battle.

During the Anglo-Scottish Wars, John Ross, 2nd Lord Ross of Halkhead, died when leading his forces against the English at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513.

Chief Alexander Ross 9th of Balnagowan (d.1592) is recorded as being a man of violence, utterly unscrupulous, given to raiding lands and forcing his clansmen to draw out agreements in his favour with total disregard for the law. Soon he was imprisoned in Tantallon Castle. Later he was released on the condition that he would live peacefully but he did not. His own son George was given permission to use fire and sword against him but Alexander could not be brought in. Alexander died in 1592.

===17th century and Civil War===

George 10th of Balnagowan was educated at St Andrew&#x27;s University, the first Ross chief to receive university education. However, he became as notorious as his father and died in 1615. His son David 11th of Balnagowan was a more peace- and law-abiding chief than his father and grandfather. David died in 1632 and his son, also called David, succeeded him.

David Ross 12th of Balnagowan signed the National Covenant at Inverness on 26 April 1638. He later joined the royalists for a short time only to become a covenanter again and was present at the defeat of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose at the Battle of Carbisdale in 1650. The Clan Ross and Clan Munro fought on the side of the Scottish Government, then led by the Duke of Argyll. They defeated the royalist army of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. David Ross, 12th of Balnagowan later led some of the clan at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 where he was captured and imprisoned at the Tower of London. He is said to have died there in 1653 and been buried in Westminster.

In 1689, 100 men of the Clan Ross occupied Castle Leod to watch for movements of the Jacobite Mackenzies.

===18th Century===

====Jacobite rising of 1715–1719====

In 1715, during the Jacobite rising, the Clan Ross along with their allies the Clan Munro, Clan Mackay and Clan Sutherland were forced into a retreat by a larger force of Jacobites in what is known as the Skirmish of Alness. The Jacobites were led by William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, chief of the Clan Mackenzie.

The clan rivalries which had erupted in rebellion were finding an outlet in local politics. The Mackenzie&#x27;s Earl of Seaforth title came to an end in 1716, and it seems to have been arranged that while the Clan Ross held the county seat the Munros would represent the Tain Burghs. To secure the burghs, control of three out of the five was necessary. The Ross ascendancy was secure in Tain, and from 1716 to 1745 the Munros controlled Dingwall. In 1719 a company of men from the Clan Ross fought for the government at the Battle of Glen Shiel where the Jacobites, including the Mackenzies were defeated.

In 1721, a small force of men from the Clan Ross, led by chief William Ross 6th of the Pitcalnie line and his brother Robert went on a rent collecting expedition into the lands of the Mackenzies. They were defeated by a much larger force of Mackenzies at the Battle of Glen Affric. General Wade&#x27;s report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the combined clan strength of the Rosses and Munros at 700 men.

====War in France====

Col. Charles, 13th Lord Ross of Hawkhead and 15th of Balnagowan, was killed in 1745 leading some members of the clan at the Battle of Fontenoy fighting against the French on 30 April 1745. Balnagowan passed to George, 13th Lord Ross, in 1745. William, 14th Lord Ross, died unmarried, and Balnagowan then passed to Sir James Lockhard, 2nd Baronet of Carstairs.

====Jacobite rising of 1745–1746====

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, in the County of Ross, although from the Pitcalnie line, the nominal 18th Chief of Clan Ross was Alexander Ross of Pitcalnie. He was a staunch Protestant, somewhat more tolerant of Jacobites than his father but definitely pro-Hanoverian. In addition, Alexander&#x27;s uncle, Duncan Forbes of Culloden, was Lord President of the Court of Session for King George II of Great Britain&#x27;s government in London. Duncan Forbes and Alexander Ross the Pitcalnie chief raised an Independent Highland Company to garrison Inverness Castle against the Jacobites.

The McFarquhars of Redcastle brought a strong Jacobite contingent from the Black Isle to join the forces of the Earl of Cromarty and a rebel, John Ross joined them. Forays were made before the Battle of Culloden and on the day before the battle, 15 April 1746, about 200 of the McFarquhar&#x27;s Jacobite force were ambushed by pro-government Scots at the Battle of Littleferry near Golspie. At most, one-tenth survived; John Ross escaped to Sutherland but was first to be put on a list of rebels. However, apart from him the Clan Ross supported the government.

The chiefship of Clan Ross devolved upon Ross of Pitcalnie, heir of David who was the last of the direct line of Balnagowan. Sir John, the 5th baronet, assumed the name &quot;Ross&quot; and then, after Carstairs was sold in 1762, the designation &quot;of Balnagowan.&quot;

The Balnagowan estate itself is no longer in Ross hands. Its recent owner, Egyptian millionaire Mohammed Fayed (d. 2023), former owner of the Harrods department store, put a lot of money into improving the estate and restoring the castle. The current Chief lives in Perthshire. His son, Hugh, and grandson, Calum, are both interested and involved in the Gaelic scene across Scotland.

==Chiefs==
*The current chief of Clan Ross is Baron David Campbell Ross, of Ross and Balnagowan.

==Tartans==

Clan Ross has three tartans:
* Ross Red tartan
* Ross Dress tartan (modern &amp; ancient)
* Ross Hunting tartan (modern, ancient &amp; weathered)

==Castles==

*Balnagown Castle, eight miles north-east of Alness was originally built in the fourteenth century but was extended in later years. The castle was first built by the Rosses in 1375. The castle was lost by the Ross chiefs in the eighteenth century due to debt but was bought from them by the Rosses of Hawkhead who were a southern branch of the clan. The property remained with the Ross family until 1978. There are stories of two ghosts in the castle: the first is of &quot;black&quot; Andrew Munro of Milntown who is said to have been hanged from Balnagown Castle in 1522 after being found guilty of many dastardly deeds. (However, historian Alexander Mackenzie says that Munro died after falling down the steps of his own Milntown Castle and breaking his neck before 1522). Munro&#x27;s ghost is said to manifest itself into women. The other ghost is of a young woman clad in grey dress with auburn hair and green eyes. The story goes that her skeleton is walled up somewhere in the castle.
*Hawkhead Castle was a mile east of Paisley in Renfrewshire. It consisted of a strong keep and tower that were later incorporated into a mansion. Hawkhead was a property of the Rosses from the middle of the fifteenth century and they built the original castle.
*Arnage Castle, near Ellon, Aberdeenshire is a Z-plan tower house that was sold to John Ross, Provost of Aberdeen in 1702. Not to be confused with &quot;Provost Ross&#x27;s House&quot; that was home of the same John Ross and now houses part of Aberdeen Maritime Museum.
*Balconie Castle, near Alness, Ross and Cromarty, was held by the Earls of Ross.
*Caisteal nan Corr, also known as Invercassley, near Lairg in Sutherland, are the slight remains of a tower house once held by the Rosses.
*Pitcalnie Castle, near Cromarty, is the site of a castle that was held by the Munros but passed to the Rosses in the eighteenth century.
*Portencross Castle, also known as Ardneil Castle, near West Kilbride, in Ayrshire was originally held by the Rosses but passed to the Clan Boyd after the Wars of Scottish Independence.
*Sanquhar Castle near Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway was once held by the Rosses but passed to the Clan Crichton in the fourteenth century, and then much later to the Clan Douglas.
*Shandwick Castle, near Balintore, Easter Ross was held by the Rosses of Shandwick. (The Rosses of Shandwick are the present chiefs of Clan Ross). Sir Ronald Ross of Shandwick was an eminent physician who discovered the cause of Malaria.
*Tain Through Time in Tain, Ross and Cromarty has information about the Rosses in a Clan Ross centre.

<doc id="140988" wikidata="Q4115364" url="?curid=140988" title="Bow drill">
<text>A bow drill is a simple hand-operated type of tool, consisting of a rod (the &quot;spindle&quot; or &quot;drill shaft&quot;) that is set in rapid rotary motion by means of a cord wrapped around it, kept taut by a bow which is pushed back and forth with one hand. This tool of prehistoric origin has been used both as a drill, to make holes on solid materials such as wood, stone, bone, or teeth, and as a fire drill to start a fire.

The spindle can be held into a fixed frame, or by a hand-held block (the &quot;hand piece&quot; or &quot;thimble&quot;) with a hole into which the top of the shaft is inserted. Some lubricant should be used to reduce friction between these two parts, otherwise, it could lead to some trouble when doing it too fast. A popular campcraft book of 1920 attributed this invention to the Inuit. In Mehrgarh (Pakistan) it has been dated between the 4th-5th millennium BCE.

The string of the bow is wrapped once around the spindle, so that it is tight enough not to slip during operation. In a variation called the Egyptian bow drill, the cord is wound around the shaft multiple times, or is fixed to it by a knot or a hole.

The strap drill is a simpler version, where the bow is absent and the cord is kept taut by pulling the ends with both hands, while moving them left and right at the same time. In the absence of a frame, the thimble is shaped so that it can be held with the chin or the mouth.

The bow lathe used for traditional woodturning uses the same principle as the bow drill.

==History==
Bow drills with green jasper bits were used in Mehrgarh between the 4th and 5th millennium BC to drill holes into lapis lazuli and carnelian. Similar drills were found in other parts of the Indus Valley civilization and Iran one millennium later.

==Usage as a fire drill==
For use as a fire drill, the shaft should have a blunt end, which is placed into a small cavity of a stationary piece of wood (the &quot;fireboard&quot;). Turning the shaft with high speed and downward pressure generates heat, which eventually creates powdered charcoal and ignites it forming a small ember.

For drilling, the lower end of the spindle may be fitted with a hard drill bit that creates the hole by abrasion or cutting.

<doc id="140989" wikidata="Q133493" url="?curid=140989" title="XScale">
<text>XScale is a microarchitecture for central processing units initially designed by Intel implementing the ARM architecture (version 5) instruction set. XScale comprises several distinct families: IXP, IXC, IOP, PXA and CE (see more below), with some later models designed as system-on-a-chip (SoC). Intel sold the PXA family to Marvell Technology Group in June 2006. Marvell then extended the brand to include processors with other microarchitectures, like Arm&#x27;s Cortex.

The XScale architecture is based on the ARMv5TE ISA without the floating-point instructions. XScale uses a seven-stage integer and an eight-stage memory super-pipelined microarchitecture. It is the successor to the Intel StrongARM line of microprocessors and microcontrollers, which Intel acquired from DEC&#x27;s Digital Semiconductor division as part of a settlement of a lawsuit between the two companies. Intel used the StrongARM to replace its ailing line of outdated RISC processors, the i860 and i960.

All the generations of XScale are 32-bit ARMv5TE processors manufactured with a 0.18 μm or 0.13 μm (as in IXP43x parts) process and have a 32 KB data cache and a 32 KB instruction cache. First- and second-generation XScale multi-core processors also have a 2 KB mini data cache (claimed it &quot;avoids &#x27;thrashing&#x27; of the D-Cache for frequently changing data streams&quot;). Products based on the third-generation XScale have up to 512 KB unified L2 cache.

==Processor families==
The XScale core is used in a number of microcontroller families manufactured by Intel and Marvell:

* Application processors (with the prefix PXA). There are four generations of XScale application processors, described below: PXA210/PXA25x, PXA26x, PXA27x, and PXA3xx.
* I/O processors (with the prefix IOP).
* Network processors (with the prefix IXP).
* Control plane processors (with the prefix IXC).
* Consumer electronics processors (with the prefix CE).

There are also standalone processors: the 80200 and 80219 (targeted primarily at PCI applications).

===PXA===
PXA System on a Chip (SoC) products were designed in Austin, Texas. The code-names for this product line are small towns in Texas, primarily near deer hunting leases frequented by the Intel XScale core and mobile phone SoC marketing team. PXA System on a Chip products were popular on smartphones and PDAs (with Windows Mobile, Symbian OS, Palm OS) during 2000 to 2006.
====PXA210/PXA25x====

The PXA210 was Intel&#x27;s entry-level XScale targeted at mobile phone applications. It was released with the PXA250 in February 2002 and comes clocked at 133 MHz and 200 MHz.

The PXA25x family (code-named Cotulla) consists of the PXA250 and PXA255. The PXA250 was Intel&#x27;s first generation of XScale processors. There was a choice of three clock speeds: 200 MHz, 300 MHz and 400 MHz. It came out in February 2002. In March 2003, the revision C0 of the PXA250 was renamed to PXA255. The main differences were a doubled internal bus speed (100 MHz to 200 MHz) for faster data transfer, lower core voltage (only 1.3 V at 400 MHz) for lower power consumption and writeback functionality for the data cache, the lack of which had severely impaired performance on the PXA250.

Intel XScale Core Features :

* ARMv5TE
* ARM Thumb
* ARM DSP
* L1 32-KByte data and instruction cache

====PXA26x====
The PXA26x family (code-named Dalhart) consists of the PXA260 and PXA261-PXA263. The PXA260 is a stand-alone processor clocked at the same frequency as the PXA25x, but features a TPBGA package which is about 53% smaller than the PXA25x&#x27;s PBGA package. The PXA261-PXA263 are the same as the PXA260 but have Intel StrataFlash memory stacked on top of the processor in the same package; 16 MB of 16-bit memory in the PXA261, 32 MB of 16-bit memory in the PXA262 and 32 MB of 32-bit memory in the PXA263. The PXA26x family was released in March 2003.

====PXA27x====

The PXA27x family (code-named Bulverde) consists of the PXA270 and PXA271-PXA272 processors. This revision is a huge update to the XScale family of processors. The PXA270 is clocked in four different speeds: 312 MHz, 416 MHz, 520 MHz and 624 MHz and is a stand-alone processor with no packaged memory. The PXA271 can be clocked to 13, 104, 208 MHz or 416 MHz and has 32 MB of 16-bit stacked StrataFlash memory and 32 MB of 16-bit SDRAM in the same package. The PXA272 can be clocked to 312 MHz, 416 MHz or 520 MHz and has 64 MB of 32-bit stacked StrataFlash memory.

Intel also added many new technologies to the PXA27x family such as:
* SpeedStep: the operating system can clock the processor down based on load to save power.
* Wireless MMX (code-named Concan; &quot;iwMMXt&quot;): 43 new SIMD instructions containing the full MMX instruction set and the integer instructions from Intel&#x27;s SSE instruction set along with some instructions unique to the XScale. Wireless MMX provides 16 extra 64-bit registers that can be treated as an array of two 32-bit words, four 16-bit halfwords or eight 8-bit bytes. The XScale core can then perform up to eight adds or four MACs in parallel in a single cycle. This capability is used to boost speed in decoding and encoding of multimedia and in playing games.
* Additional peripherals, such as a USB-Host interface and a camera interface.
* Internal 256 KB SRAM to reduce power consumption and latency.

The PXA27x family was released in April 2004. Along with the PXA27x family Intel released the 2700G embedded graphics co-processor(code-named Marathon).

====PXA3xx====

In August 2005 Intel announced the successor to Bulverde, codenamed Monahans.

They demonstrated it showing its capability to play back high definition encoded video on a PDA screen.

The new processor was shown clocked at 1.25 GHz but Intel said it only offered a 25% increase in performance (800 MIPS for the 624 MHz PXA270 processor vs. 1000 MIPS for 1.25 GHz Monahans). An announced successor to the 2700G graphics processor, code named Stanwood, has since been canceled. sd features of Stanwood are integrated into Monahans. For extra graphics capabilities, Intel recommends third-party chips like the Nvidia GoForce chip family.

In November 2006, Marvell Semiconductor officially introduced the Monahans family as Marvell PXA320, PXA300, and PXA310. PXA320 is currently shipping in high volume, and is scalable up to 806 MHz. PXA300 and PXA310 deliver performance &quot;scalable to 624 MHz&quot;, and are software-compatible with PXA320.

====PXA800F====
Codenamed Manitoba, Intel PXA800F was a SoC introduced by Intel in 2003 for use in GSM- and GPRS-enabled mobile phones. The chip was built around an XScale processor core, the likes of which had been used in PDAs, clocked at 312 MHz and manufactured with a 0.13 μm process, with 4 MB of integrated flash memory and a digital signal processor.

A prototype board with the chip was demoed during the Intel Developer Forum. Intel noted it was in talks with leading mobile phone manufacturers, such as Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericsson, about incorporating Manitoba into their phones.

O2 XM, released in 2005, was the only mobile phone with a documented use of the Manitoba chip. An Intel executive stated that the chip version used in the phone was reworked to be less expensive than the initial one.

====PXA90x====
The PXA90x, codenamed Hermon, was a successor to Manitoba with 3G support. The PXA90x is built using a 130 nm process. The SoC continued being marketed by Marvell as they acquired Intel&#x27;s XScale business.

====PXA16x====
PXA16x is a processor designed by Marvell, combining the earlier Intel designed PXA SoC components with a new ARMv5TE CPU core named Mohawk or PJ1 from Marvell&#x27;s Sheeva family instead of using wdc Xscale or ARM design. The CPU core is derived from the Feroceon core used in Marvell&#x27;s embedded Kirkwood product line, but extended for instruction level compatibility with the XScale IWMMX.

The PXA16x delivers strong performance at a mass market price point for cost sensitive consumer and embedded markets such as digital picture frames, E Readers, multifunction printer user interface (UI) displays, interactive VoIP phones, IP surveillance cameras, and home control gadgets.

====PXA930/935====
The PXA930 and PXA935 processor series were again built using the Sheeva microarchitecture developed by Marvell but upgraded to ARMv7 instruction set compatibility. This core is a so-called Tri-core architecture codenamed Tavor; Tri-core means it supports the ARMv5TE, ARMv6 and ARMv7 instruction sets. This new architecture was a significant leap from the old Xscale architecture. The PXA930 uses 65 nm technology while the PXA935 is built using the 45 nm process.

The PXA930 is used in the BlackBerry Bold 9700.

====PXA940====
Little is known about the PXA940, although it is known to be ARM Cortex-A8 compliant. It is utilized in the BlackBerry Torch 9800 and is built using 45 nm technology.

====PXA986/PXA988====
After XScale and Sheeva, the PXA98x uses the third CPU core design, this time licensed directly from ARM, in form of dual core Cortex A9 application processors utilized by devices like Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0.

====PXA1088====
It is a quad core Cortex A7 application processor with Vivante GPU.

===IXC===

====IXC1100====
The IXC1100 processor features clock speeds at 266, 400, and 533 MHz, a 133 MHz bus, 32 KB of instruction cache, 32 KB of data cache, and 2 KB of mini-data cache. It is also designed for low power consumption, using 2.4 W at 533 MHz. The chip comes in the 35 mm PBGA package.

===IOP===
The IOP line of processors is designed to allow computers and storage devices to transfer data and increase performance by offloading I/O functionality from the main CPU of the device. The IOP3XX processors are based on the XScale architecture and designed to replace the older 80219 sd and i960 family of chips. There are ten different IOP processors currently available: IOP303, IOP310, IOP315, IOP321, IOP331, IOP332, IOP333, IOP341, IOP342 and IOP348. Clock speeds range from 100 MHz to 1.2 GHz. The processors also differ in PCI bus type, PCI bus speed, memory type, maximum memory allowable, and the number of processor cores.

===IXP network processor===

The XScale core is utilized in the second generation of Intel&#x27;s IXP network processor line, while the first generation used StrongARM cores. The IXP network processor family ranges from solutions aimed at small/medium office network applications, IXP4XX, to high performance network processors such as the IXP2850, capable of sustaining up to OC-192 line rates. In IXP4XX devices the XScale core is used as both a control and data plane processor, providing both system control and data processing. The task of the XScale in the IXP2XXX devices is typically to provide control plane functionality only, with data processing performed by the microengines, examples of such control plane tasks include routing table updates, microengine control, and memory management.

===CE===
In April 2007, Intel announced an XScale-based processor targeting consumer electronics markets, the Intel CE 2110 (codenamed Olo River).

==Applications==
XScale microprocessors were used in RIM&#x27;s BlackBerry handheld, the Dell Axim family of Pocket PCs, most of the Zire, Treo and Tungsten Handheld lines by Palm, later versions of the Sharp Zaurus, the Motorola A780, the Acer n50, the Compaq iPaq 3900 series, and in other PDAs. It was the CPU in the Iyonix PC desktop computer running RISC OS, and the NSLU2 (Slug) running Linux. XScale is also used in devices such as PVPs (Portable Video Players), PMCs (Portable Media Centres), including the Creative Zen Portable Media Player and Amazon Kindle E-Book reader, and in industrial embedded systems.

At the other end of the market, the XScale IOP33x Storage I/O processors are used in some Intel Xeon-based server platforms.

==Sale of PXA processor line==
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel&#x27;s XScale PXA mobile processor assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale PXA business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated $600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses. Marvell holds a full architecture license for ARM, allowing it to design chips to implement the ARM instruction set, not just license a processor core.

The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006. Intel was expected to continue manufacturing XScale processors until Marvell secures other manufacturing facilities, and would continue manufacturing and selling the IXP and IOP processors, as they were not part of the deal.

The XScale effort at Intel was initiated by the purchase of the StrongARM division from Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998. Intel still holds an ARM license even after the sale of XScale; this license is at the architectural level.

<text>Tanning, or hide tanning, is the process of treating skins and hides of animals to produce leather. A tannery is the place where the skins are processed.

Historically, vegetable based tanning used tannin, an acidic chemical compound derived from the bark of certain trees, in the production of leather. An alternative method, developed in the 1800s, is chrome tanning, where chromium salts are used instead of natural tannins.

== History ==
Tanning hide into leather involves a process which permanently alters the protein structure of skin, making it more durable and less susceptible to decomposition and coloring. The place where hides are processed is known as a &quot;tannery&quot;.

The English word for tanning is from medieval Latin , derivative of (oak bark), from French (tanbark), from old-Cornish (oak). These terms are related to the hypothetical Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;fir tree&#x27;. (The same word is source for Old High German meaning &#x27;fir&#x27;, related to modern German &quot;Tannenbaum&quot;).

Ancient civilizations used leather for waterskins, bags, harnesses and tack, boats, armour, quivers, scabbards, boots, and sandals. Tanning was being carried out by the inhabitants of Mehrgarh in Pakistan between 7000 and 3300 BCE. Around 2500 BCE, the Sumerians began using leather, affixed by copper , on chariot wheels.

The process of tanning was also used for boats and fishing vessels: ropes, nets, and sails were tanned using tree bark.

Formerly, tanning was considered a noxious or &quot;odoriferous trade&quot; and relegated to the outskirts of town, among the poor. Tanning by ancient methods is so foul-smelling that tanneries are still isolated from those towns today where the old methods are used. Skins typically arrived at the tannery dried stiff and dirty with soil and gore. First, the ancient tanners would soak the skins in water to clean and soften them. Then they would pound and scour the skin to remove any remaining flesh and fat. Hair was removed by soaking the skin in urine, painting it with an alkaline lime mixture, or simply allowing the skin to putrefy for several months then dipping it in a salt solution. After the hair was loosened, the tanners scraped it off with a knife. Once the hair was removed, the tanners would &quot;bate&quot; (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains. Bating was a fermentative process that relied on enzymes produced by bacteria found in the dung. Among the kinds of dung commonly used were those of dogs or pigeons.

Historically the actual tanning process used vegetable tanning. In some variations of the process, cedar oil, alum, or tannin was applied to the skin as a tanning agent. As the skin was stretched, it would lose moisture and absorb the agent.

Following the adoption in medicine of soaking gut sutures in a chromium (III) solution after 1840, it was discovered that this method could also be used with leather and thus was adopted by tanners.

== Preparation ==
The tanning process begins with obtaining an animal skin. When an animal skin is to be tanned, the animal is killed and skinned before the body heat leaves the tissues. This can be done by the tanner, or by obtaining a skin at a slaughterhouse, farm, or local fur trader.

Before tanning, the skins are often dehaired, then have fat, meat and connective tissue removed. They are then washed and soaked in water with various compounds, and prepared to receive a tanning agent. They are then soaked, stretched, dried, and sometimes smoked.

=== Curing ===
Preparing hides begins by curing them with salt to prevent putrefaction of the collagen from bacterial growth during the time lag from procuring the hide to when it is processed. Curing removes water from the hides and skins using a difference in osmotic pressure. The moisture content of hides and skins is greatly reduced, and osmotic pressure increased, to the point that bacteria are unable to grow. In wet-salting, the hides are heavily salted, then pressed into packs for about 30 days. In brine-curing, the hides are agitated in a saltwater bath for about 16 hours. Curing can also be accomplished by preserving the hides and skins at very low temperatures.

== Beamhouse operations ==
The steps in the production of leather between curing and tanning are collectively referred to as beamhouse operations. They include, in order, soaking, liming, removal of extraneous tissues (unhairing, scudding and fleshing), deliming, bating or puering, drenching, and pickling.

=== Soaking ===
In soaking, the hides are soaked in clean water to remove the salt left over from curing and increase the moisture so that the hide or skin can be further treated.

To prevent damage of the skin by bacterial growth during the soaking period, biocides, typically dithiocarbamates, may be used. Fungicides such as TCMTB may also be added later in the process, to protect wet leathers from mold growth. After 1980, the use of pentachlorophenol and mercury-based biocides and their derivatives was forbidden.

=== Liming ===

After soaking, the hides are treated with milk of lime (a basic agent) typically supplemented by &quot;sharpening agents&quot; (disulfide reducing agents) such as sodium sulfide, cyanides, amines, etc.

This:
* Removes the hair and other keratinous matter
* Removes some of the interfibrillary soluble proteins such as mucins
* Causes the fibers to swell up and split up to the desired extent
* Removes the natural grease and fats to some extent
* Brings the collagen in the hide to a proper condition for satisfactory tannage

The weakening of hair is dependent on the breakdown of the disulfide link of the amino acid cystine, which is the characteristic of the keratin class of proteins that gives strength to hair and wools (keratin typically makes up 90% of the dry weight of hair). The hydrogen atoms supplied by the sharpening agent weaken the cystine molecular link whereby the covalent disulfide bond links are ultimately ruptured, weakening the keratin. To some extent, sharpening also contributes to unhairing, as it tends to break down the hair proteins.

The isoelectric point of the collagen (a tissue-strengthening protein unrelated to keratin) in the hide is also shifted to around pH 4.7 due to liming.
Any hairs remaining after liming are removed mechanically by scraping the skin with a dull knife, a process known as scudding.

=== Deliming and bating ===
The pH of the collagen is then reduced so the enzymes may act on it in a process known as deliming. Depending on the end use of the leather, hides may be treated with enzymes to soften them, a process called bating. In modern tanning, these enzymes are purified agents, and the process no longer requires bacterial fermentation (as from dung-water soaking) to produce them.

=== Pickling ===
Pickling is another term for tanning, or what is the modern equivalent of turning rawhide into leather by the use of modern chemical agents, if mineral tanning is preferred. Once bating is complete, the hides and skins are treated by first soaking them in a bath containing common salt (sodium chloride), usually 1 quart of salt to 1 gallon of hot water. When the water cools, one fluid ounce of sulfuric acid is added. Small skins are left in this liquor for 2 days, while larger skins between 1 week and as much as 2 months.

In vegetable tanning, the hides are made to soak in a bath solution containing vegetable tannins, such as found in gallnuts, the leaves of sumac, the leaves of certain acacia trees, the outer green shells of walnuts, among other plants. The use of vegetable tanning is a process that takes longer than mineral tanning when converting rawhides into leather. Mineral tanned leather is used principally for shoes, car seats, and upholstery in homes (sofas, etc.). Vegetable tanned leather is used in leather crafting and in making small leather items, such as wallets, handbags and clothes.

== Process ==
=== Chrome tanning ===
Chromium(III) sulfate () has long been regarded as the most efficient and effective tanning agent. Chromium(III) compounds of the sort used in tanning are significantly less toxic than hexavalent chromium, although the latter arises in inadequate waste treatment. Chromium(III) sulfate dissolves to give the hexaaquachromium(III) cation, [Cr(H2O)6]3+, which at higher pH undergoes processes called olation to give polychromium(III) compounds that are active in tanning, being the cross-linking of the collagen subunits. The chemistry of [Cr(H2O)6]3+ is more complex in the tanning bath rather than in water due to the presence of a variety of ligands. Some ligands include the sulfate anion, the collagen&#x27;s carboxyl groups, amine groups from the side chains of the amino acids, and masking agents. Masking agents are carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, used to suppress formation of polychromium(III) chains. Masking agents allow the tanner to further increase the pH to increase collagen&#x27;s reactivity without inhibiting the penetration of the chromium(III) complexes.

Collagen is characterized by a high content of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, usually in the repeat -gly-pro-hypro-gly-. These residues give rise to collagen&#x27;s helical structure. Collagen&#x27;s high content of hydroxyproline allows cross-linking by hydrogen bonding within the helical structure. Ionized carboxyl groups (RCO2−) are formed by the action of hydroxide. This conversion occurs during the liming process, before introduction of the tanning agent (chromium salts). Later during pickling, collagen carboxyl groups are temporarily protonated for ready transport of chromium ions. During basification step of tanning, the carboxyl groups are ionized and coordinate as ligands to the chromium(III) centers of the oxo-hydroxide clusters.

Tanning increases the spacing between protein chains in collagen from 10 to 17 Å. The difference is consistent with cross-linking by polychromium species, of the sort arising from olation and oxolation.
Before the introduction of the basic chromium species in tanning, several steps are required to produce a tannable hide. The pH must be very acidic when the chromium is introduced to ensure that the chromium complexes are small enough to fit between the fibers and residues of the collagen. Once the desired level of penetration of chrome into the substance is achieved, the pH of the material is raised again to facilitate the process. This step is known as basification. In the raw state, chrome-tanned skins are greyish-blue, so are referred to as &quot;wet blue&quot;. Chrome tanning is faster than vegetable tanning (taking less than a day for this part of the process) and produces a stretchable leather which is excellent for use in handbags and garments.

After application of the chromium agent, the bath is treated with sodium bicarbonate in the basification process to increase the pH to 3.8–4.0, inducing cross-linking between the chromium and the collagen. The pH increase is normally accompanied by a gradual temperature increase up to 40 °C. Chromium&#x27;s ability to form such stable bridged bonds explains why it is considered one of the most effective tanning compounds. Chromium-tanned leather can contain between 4 and 5% of chromium. This efficiency is characterized by its increased hydrothermal stability of the skin, and its resistance to shrinkage in heated water.

=== Vegetable tanning ===
Vegetable tanning uses tannins (a class of polyphenol astringent chemicals), which occur naturally in the bark and leaves of many plants. Tannins bind to the collagen proteins in the hide and coat them, causing them to become less water-soluble and more resistant to bacterial attack. The process also causes the hide to become more flexible. The primary barks processed in bark mills and used in modern times are chestnut, oak, redoul, tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove, wattle (acacia; see catechol), and myrobalans from &quot;Terminalia&quot; spp., such as &quot;Terminalia chebula&quot;. In Ethiopia, the combined vegetable oils of Niger seed (Guizotia abyssinica) and flaxseeds were used in treating the flesh side of the leather, as a means of tawing, rather than of tanning. In Yemen and Egypt, hides were tanned by soaking them in a bath containing the crushed leaves and bark of the Salam acacia (Acacia etbaica; A. nilotica kraussiana). Hides that have been stretched on frames are immersed for several weeks in vats of increasing concentrations of tannin. Vegetable-tanned hide is not very flexible. It is used for luggage, furniture, footwear, belts, and other clothing accessories.

=== Alternative chemicals ===
&quot;Wet white&quot; is a term used for leathers produced using alternative tanning methods that produce an off-white colored leather. Like wet blue, wet white is also a semifinished stage. Wet white can be produced using aldehydes, aluminum, zirconium, titanium, or iron salts, or a combination thereof. Concerns with the toxicity and environmental impact of any chromium (VI) that may form during the tanning process have led to increased research into more efficient wet white methods.

=== Natural tanning ===
The conditions present in bogs, including highly acidic water, low temperature, and a lack of oxygen, combine to preserve but severely tan the skin of bog bodies.

=== Tawing ===
Tawing is a method that uses alum and other aluminium salts, generally in conjunction with binders such as egg yolk, flour, or other salts. The hide is tawed by soaking in a warm potash alum and salts solution, between . The process increases the hide&#x27;s pliability, stretchability, softness, and quality. Then, the hide is air dried (crusted) for several weeks, which allows it to stabilize.

The use of alum alone for tanning rawhides is not recommended, as it shrinks the surface area of the skin, making it thicker and hard to the touch. If alum is applied to the fur, it makes the fur dull and harsh.

==Post-tanning finishing==
Depending on the finish desired, the leather may be waxed, rolled, lubricated, injected with oil, split, shaved, or dyed.

== Health and environmental impact ==
The tanning process involves chemical and organic compounds that can have a detrimental effect on the environment. Agents such as chromium, vegetable tannins, and aldehydes are used in the tanning step of the process. Chemicals used in tanned leather production increase the levels of chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved solids in water when not disposed of responsibly. These processes also use large quantities of water and produce large amounts of pollutants.

Boiling and sun drying can oxidize and convert the various chromium(III) compounds used in tanning into carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, or chromium(VI). This hexavalent chromium runoff and scraps are then consumed by animals, in the case of Bangladesh, chickens (the nation&#x27;s most common source of protein). Up to 25% of the chickens in Bangladesh contained harmful levels of hexavalent chromium, adding to the national health problem load.

Chromium is not solely responsible for these diseases. Methylisothiazolinone, which is used for microbiological protection (fungal or bacterial growth), causes problems with the eyes and skin. Anthracene, which is used as a leather tanning agent, can cause problems in the kidneys and liver and is also considered a carcinogen. Formaldehyde and arsenic, which are used for leather finishing, cause health problems in the eyes, lungs, liver, kidneys, skin, and lymphatic system and are also considered carcinogens. The waste from leather tanneries is detrimental to the environment and the people who live in it. The use of old technologies plays a large factor in how hazardous wastewater results in contaminating the environment. This is especially prominent in small and medium-sized tanneries in developing countries.

The UN Leather Working Group (LWG) &quot;provides an environmental audit protocol, designed to assess the facilities of leather manufacturers,&quot; for &quot;traceability, energy conservation, [and] responsible management of waste products.&quot;

== Alternatives ==

Untanned hides can be dried and made pliable by rubbing and stretching the fibers with a hide stretcher, and fatting. However the hide will revert to rawhide if not periodically replenished with fat or oil, especially if it gets wet. Many Native Americans of the arid western regions wore clothing made by this process.

Smoke tanning is listed among the conventional methods like chrome tanning and vegetable tanning. Impregnation of the hide&#x27;s cells with formaldehyde (from smoke) offers some microbial and water resistance.

== Associated processes ==

Leftover leather would historically be turned into glue. Tanners would place scraps of hides in a vat of water and let them deteriorate for months. The mixture would then be placed over a fire to boil off the water to produce glue.

A tannery may be associated with a grindery, originally a whetstone facility for sharpening knives and other sharp tools, but later could carry shoemakers&#x27; tools and materials for sale.

There are several solid and waste water treatment methodologies currently being researched, such as anaerobic digestion of solid wastes and wastewater sludge.

<doc id="140992" wikidata="Q1669978" url="?curid=140992" title="Lithic core">
<text>In archaeology, a lithic core is a distinctive artifact that results from the practice of lithic reduction. In this sense, a core is the scarred nucleus resulting from the detachment of one or more flakes from a lump of source material or tool stone, usually by using a hard hammer precursor such as a hammerstone. The core is marked with the negative scars of these flakes. The surface area of the core which received the blows necessary for detaching the flakes is referred to as the striking platform. The core may be discarded or shaped further into a core tool, such as can be seen in some types of handaxe.

== Definitions ==
A &quot;core&quot; can be defined in a number of different ways based on the theoretical and methodological approach of the archaeologist. Typological approaches to classify cores are generally based on a combination of the technological attributes and presumed function of an artefact while technological approaches are generally based solely on the technological attributes and an artefacts place in the overall reduction sequence. Other terms used for core include &quot;nucleus&quot; or &quot;objective piece&quot;.

== Function ==

The purpose of core reduction may be to rough out a blank for later refinement into a projectile point, knife, or other stone tool, or it may be performed in order to obtain sharp flakes, from which a variety of simple tools can be made. Generally, the presence of a core is indicative of the latter process, since the former process usually leaves no core. Because the morphology of cores will influence the shape of flakes, by studying the core surface morphology, we might be able to know more information about the dimensional flake attribute, including their length and thickness.

== Types of cores ==
Cores may be subdivided into specific types by a lithic analyst. Type frequencies, as well as the general types of materials at an archaeological site, can give the lithic analyst a better understanding of the lithic reduction processes occurring at that site.

Cores may be described on the basis of the direction of flake removals, the number of faces with negative flake scars or the general morphology of the core. Examples of this include multidirectional, conical, cylindrical, biconical, or bifacial cores. A multidirectional core is the product of any random rock, from which flakes were taken based on the geometry of the rock in any pattern until no further flakes could be removed. Often, multidirectional cores are used in this way until no obvious platforms are present, and then are reduced through bipolar reduction, until the core itself is too small to produce useful flakes. Conical cores have a definite pattern. One flake was removed from a narrow end of the tool stone, and this was then used as the platform to take flakes off in a unifacial fashion all around the edge of the rock. The end result is a cone-like shape. Cylindrical lithic cores are made in a similar fashion, but there is a platform on both ends of the tool stone, with flakes going up and down the side of the cylinder from either direction.

 Biconical cores have several platforms around the edge of the stone, with flakes taken alternately from either side, resulting in what looks like a pair of cones stuck together at the bases. Bifacial cores are similar to biconical cores, except that instead of forming a pair of cones, the flakes are taken off in such a way that the core itself grows thinner, without the edges shrinking much. Bifacial cores are usually further reduced into trade bifaces, biface blanks, or bifacial tools. Bifacial cores have been recognized as a technology allowing for efficient material usage (specifically in the creation of edge scrapers) and for their suitability for highly mobile hunter gatherer groups in need of tools made of high quality lithic materials.

<doc id="140994" wikidata="Q10828323" url="?curid=140994" title="Annam (French protectorate)">
<text>Annam (; alternate spelling: &quot;Anam&quot;), or Trung Kỳ (), was a French protectorate encompassing what is now Central Vietnam from 1883 to 1949. Like the French protectorate of Tonkin, it was nominally ruled by the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty. Before the protectorate&#x27;s establishment, the name &quot;Annam&quot; was used in the West to refer to Vietnam as a whole; Vietnamese people were referred to as Annamites. The protectorate of Annam became a part of French Indochina in 1887. The region had a dual system of French and Vietnamese administration. The government of the Nguyễn Dynasty still nominally ruled Annam and Tonkin as the Empire of Đại Nam, with the emperor residing in Huế. On 27 May 1948, the protectorate was partly merged in the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, which was replaced the next year by the newly established State of Vietnam. The French legally maintained the protectorate until they formally signed over sovereignty to the Bảo Đại and the government of the State of Vietnam in 1950 after signing the Élysée Accords in 1949. The region was divided between communist North Vietnam and anti-communist South Vietnam under the terms of the Geneva Accord of 1954.

== Etymology and pre-colonial usage ==

Annam means &quot;Pacified South&quot; in Sino-Vietnamese, the toponym being derived from the Chinese (). In the history of Vietnam, the designation is one of several given by the Chinese to the Tonkin, the core territory of modern-day Vietnam surrounding the city of Hanoi, which included land from the Gulf of Tonkin to the mountains which surround the plains of the Red River.

The name has also been applied to the Annamite Range (), a mountain range with a height ranging up to that divides Vietnam and Laos. The Vietnamese language or its central dialects were called &quot;Annamese&quot;, as in the seminal dictionary .

 is usually considered offensively demeaning to Vietnamese people, and mostly used in a sarcastic manner. (also spelled ) is used instead in formal contexts. At least one dictionary has translated Annamiticum as .

==Establishment==

Towards the end of the 18th century a rebellion overthrew the Nguyễn lords, but one of its members, Gia Long, by the aid of a French force, in 1801 acquired sway over the whole of present-day Vietnam (Annam, Tongking and Cochinchina). This force was procured for him by Pigneau Monsignor de Béhaine, Titular Bishop of Adran. The Monsignor saw in the political condition of Annam a means of establishing French influence in Indochina and counterbalancing British power in India. Before this, in 1787, Gia Long had concluded a treaty with Louis XVI, whereby in return for a promise of aid he ceded Tourane and Pulo-Condore to the French. That treaty marks the beginning of French influence in Indochina.

After conquering Cochinchina in 1858–1862, the French resumed in 1883 their expansion in Southern Asia. The first protectorate treaty was signed in 1883, although it was replaced the next year by a slightly milder treaty. With the treaty of Tientsin, China recognised the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin and implicitly abandoned her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam. Annam and Tonkin became part of French Indochina in 1887. On 9 May 1889, they were split in two &quot;Résidences supérieures&quot;, each subordinated to the Governor-General of French Indochina. The Nguyễn dynasty still nominally ruled over both protectorates. Tonkin was &quot;de facto&quot; ruled directly by the French, while the imperial government maintained some degree of authority over Annam. On 27 September 1897, the Vietnamese imperial council in Annam was replaced by a council of ministers, presided &quot;de jure&quot; by the French representative.

==Geography==
Annam comprised a sinuous strip of territory measuring between 750 and in length, with an approximate area of . It had a rich, well-watered soil which yields tropical crops, and was rich in naturally occurring minerals.

The country consisted chiefly of a range of plateaus and wooded mountains, running north and south and declining on the coast to a narrow band of plains varying between 12 and in breadth. The mountains are cut transversely by short narrow valleys, through which run rivers, most of which are dry in summer and torrential in winter. The Song Ma and the Song Ca in the north, and the Song Ba, Don Nai and Se Bang Khan in the south, are the only rivers of any size in the region. The chief harbour is that afforded by the bay of Tourane at the centre of the coastline. South of this point, the coast curves outwards and is broken by peninsulas and indentations; to the north it is concave and bordered in many places by dunes and lagoons.

==Climate==
In Annam, the rainy season begins during September and lasts for three or four months, corresponding with the northeastern monsoon and also with a period of typhoons. During the rains the temperature varies from 59 degrees Fahrenheit (or even lower) to 75 °F (from 15 degrees Celsius to 24 °C). June, July and August are the hottest months, the temperature often reaching or 90 °F (32 °C) or more, though the heat of the day is to some extent compensated by the freshness of the nights. The southwest monsoon which brings rain in Cochin China coincides with the dry season in Annam, probably because the mountains and lofty plateaus separating the two regions retain the precipitation.

== Economy ==
During the French period there was little industry. The economy was an agricultural one based on:

* the cultivation of rice, which grows mainly in the small deltas along the coast and in some districts gives two crops a year.
* fishing, fish salting and the preparation of fish sauce

Silk spinning and weaving were carried on in what the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition called &quot;antiquated lines ...silkworms [are] reared in a desultory fashion&quot;. Other crops were tea, tobacco, cotton, cinnamon, precious woods and rubber. Coffee, pepper, sugarcane and jute were also cultivated to a minor extent. The exports comprised tea, raw silk and small quantities of cotton, rice and sugarcane. The imports included rice, iron goods, flour, wine, opium and cotton goods. There were coal mines at Nong Son, near Da Nang, and as well as mining of gold, silver, lead, iron and other metals which occur in the mountains. Human trafficking in Annamite women and children to China occurred from the 1870s to the 1940s. Trade, which was controlled by the Chinese, was mostly carried out on the sea, with the chief ports being Da Nang and Qui Nhơn, open to European commerce.

== Administration ==
Annam was ruled in theory by its emperor (from the Nguyễn Phúc family, which was also the ruling dynasty of the previous Vietnamese state in the region), assisted by the &quot;comat&quot; or secret council. This council was composed of the heads of the six ministerial departments nominated by the emperor, namely interior, finance, war, ritual, justice, and public works. Formally the four protectorates of French Indochina were ruled by their respective monarchs, but in fact the protectorates were all under the close control of the French senior residents. As a Governor-General of French Indochina, Pierre Pasquier, stated: “The King reigns but the Resident superior rules.” The effective power in the protectorate was in the hands of the resident-superior with both the monarch and the local high officials playing a subordinate role to his office.

The Resident Superior, stationed at Huế, was the representative of France and the virtual ruler of the country. He presided over a council (&quot;Conseil de Protectorat&quot;) composed of the chiefs of the French services in Annam, together with two members of the &quot;comat&quot;; this body deliberated on questions of taxation affecting the budget of Annam and on local public works. A native governor (&quot;Tong Doc&quot; or &quot;Tuan Phu&quot;), assisted by a native staff, administered each of the provinces into which the country was divided, and native officials of lower rank governed the areas into which these provinces were subdivided. The governors took their orders from the imperial government, but they were under the eye of French residents.

Native officials were appointed by the court, but the Resident Superior had power to annul an appointment. The mandarinate or official class was recruited from all ranks of the people by competitive examination. In the province of Tourane (Da Nang), a French tribunal alone exercised jurisdiction, but it administered native law where natives were concerned. Outside this territory the native tribunals survived.

From 1 January 1898, the French directly took over the right to collect all taxes in the protectorate of Annam and to allocate salaries to the Emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty and its mandarins. In a notice dated 24 August 1898, the Resident-Superior of Annam wrote: &quot;From now on, in the Kingdom of Annam there are no longer two governments, but only one&quot; (meaning that the French government completely took over the administration).

== Education == 


During the French period the Confucian-oriented education system was slowly being replaced with a local version of the French education system. Prior to French domination teachers were held in high regard in the Confucian system, and the traditional values of the Vietnamese people include the promotion of learning and high respect for educators. In this old system teachers were deemed to be &quot;only lower than the King&quot; (Emperor) according to a 2010 report by the World Bank. In order to become a teacher in Imperial Vietnam, the mandarins would request that those who applied to become teachers should already have high grades in competitive Confucian-style exams, as well as excellent prior learning achievements. The 2010 report by the World Bank also noted that historically in Vietnam teachers would often be invited to reside together with well-to-do villagers so they would be able to tutor the children of these wealthy families as well as other children that lived in the village.

Immediately after the establishment of the colony of French Cochinchina the French established schools to teach the Vietnamese French and the French Vietnamese in order to train interpreters for the army. In Cochinchina the French immediately began replacing the Nguyễn government apparatus with the French government apparatus and education, and this formed an important part of this process. This education and training system that was established in French Cochinchina initially met the two basic goals that the French had set up in helping to train both interpreters and secretaries for the French military and colonial government, while organising a new form of education for the indigenous population that popularised French words and romanised the local languages, gradually replacing Chinese characters. Despite their efforts French words were not readily adopted, and Chinese script persisted; thus these goals only found limited success in French Cochinchina. 

Following the establishment of two protectorates over the Nguyễn dynasty the French expanded the education system they had set up in Cochinchina to the rest of Vietnam. The new French-based education system was created in the hope of training indigenous people that could serve French interests in the colonial system. During the colonial period the French built elementary schools, primary schools, primary colleges, secondary schools, and three universities across Vietnam; all these used mainly the French language for instruction. 

Education during the French protectorate period started at the primary school level (); early childhood education only became a concern in Vietnamese society following the abolition of the Nguyễn dynasty in 1945. During most of the French protectorate period as well as before, early childhood education was not considered to be a social task, and thus there was no formal educational system or curriculum for preschool children.
===20th century===
In the year 1906, France enacted its first educational reform in French Indochina to expand their influence over the local populations. These reforms were aimed at controlling the spiritual lives of the people and limiting the influence of the Confucian mandarins. The traditional mandarins were seen as a threat to French influence, as they used Confucianism to promote Vietnamese nationalism. The 1906 reforms implemented French at every level. In the 1906 the basic subjects for boys were reading and writing, mathematics, history, geography, morality, and accounting, while the basic subjects for girls were reading and writing, mathematics, morality, hygiene, and housework. Vocational education was also established to train the indigenous population to work for French capitalists as skilled labourers. 

Because only a small number of schools were constructed across Vietnam, access to these schools was extremely limited and as much as 95% of the Vietnamese population would remain illiterate during most of the period of French domination, showing the inefficiency of the education system.

In the year 1917 clear educational guidelines were established for French Indochina, and at the primary school and elementary school level Vietnamese classes were given with instructions written in Chữ Quốc Ngữ to replace Chinese characters. The Quốc Ngữ alphabet was used to turn Vietnamese into &quot;a vehicle used to transport French ideology and interests in Indochina&quot;. 

While apologists for the French colonial regime would claim that French rule led to vast improvements to the Vietnamese education system, the official statistics that were compiled and kept by the French authorities in Indochina cast doubt on such assertions. 

In the year 1939 no more than 15% of all school-age children had received any amount of education, while 80% of the general Vietnamese populace still remained illiterate. This was in contrast to pre-colonial times when the majority of the Vietnamese people were at least partly literate.

<text>The Mercury Prize, formerly called the Mercury Music Prize, is an annual music prize awarded for the best album released by a musical act from the United Kingdom or Ireland. It was created by Jon Webster and Robert Chandler in association with the British Phonographic Industry and British Association of Record Dealers in 1992 as an alternative to the Brit Awards.

== Format and eligibility ==
Any album released by a British or Irish artist, or by a band where over 50% of the members are British or Irish, may be submitted for consideration by their record label. There is a fee for submission. Twelve submitted albums are shortlisted for the prize, chosen based solely on their musical merit and irrespective of how popular or successful an album or act that has been submitted may have been in the previous calendar year. The shortlist is chosen by an independent panel of musicians, music presenters, music producers, music journalists, festival organisers, and other figures in the music industry in the UK and Ireland.

The prize is open to all types of music, including pop, rock, folk, urban, grime, dance, jazz, blues, electronica and classical. Presentation of the awards usually takes place at an Awards Show in October, after the shortlist is announced at the Album of the Year Launch in September. It is often observed that bands whose albums are shortlisted, or win the prize, experience a large increase in album sales, particularly for lesser known acts. Each shortlisted artist receives a specially commissioned &#x27;Albums of the Year&#x27; trophy at the Awards Show. Unlike some other music awards, the overall winner of the Mercury Prize also receives a cheque; in 2017, the prize money was £25,000. The winner also receives an additional winner&#x27;s trophy.

== History ==
The prize was originally sponsored by Mercury Communications, a brand owned by Cable &amp; Wireless, from which the prize gets its name. It was later sponsored by Technics (1998 to 2001), Panasonic (2002 and 2003), Nationwide Building Society (2004 to 2008) and Barclaycard (2009–14). The 2015 prize was sponsored by the BBC, while in 2016 it was announced that a three-year deal had been struck with Hyundai to sponsor the event. It was sponsored by Free Now, as part of a multi-year deal that began in 2022. In 2024, the award lost their deal with Freenow, prompting the cancellation of the ceremony and live performances for that year.

To date, PJ Harvey is the only artist to have won the award on more than one occasion (in 2001 and 2011). She was also the first female solo artist to receive the award. Alex Turner has received six nominations, five as a member of Arctic Monkeys and one with The Last Shadow Puppets, winning once. Thom Yorke has six nominations, five with Radiohead and one for &quot;The Eraser&quot;, but has never won.

The awards ceremony was postponed for the first, and so far only, time in 2022 following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Reputation==

The Mercury Prize can have a considerable effect on sales for those artists who are shortlisted. Elbow saw a 700% sales increase of their album &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot; after winning the Prize in 2008. In their winner&#x27;s speech, Elbow&#x27;s frontman Guy Garvey said that winning the Mercury Prize was &quot;quite literally the best thing that has ever happened to us&quot;. Similarly, sales of The xx&#x27;s winning album rose by 450% the day after they won the 2010 Mercury Prize and 2013 winner James Blake saw a 2,500% sales increase on Amazon after he was announced as the winner of the 2013 Mercury Prize. 2011 winner PJ Harvey&#x27;s album &quot;Let England Shake&quot; jumped from number 181 to 24 in the UK official charts the week after the 2011 Awards Show.

Despite being regarded by many as highly prestigious, it has been suggested that having an album nominated for or winning the Mercury Prize could be a curse on a career in music.

In 2001, the band Gorillaz requested that their eponymous debut album be withdrawn from the shortlist, with cartoon bassist Murdoc Niccals saying that winning the award would be &quot;like carrying a dead albatross round your neck for eternity&quot;.

All genres of music are eligible for entry, and it is stated that all are treated equally, with only the music on the album being taken into account. Simon Frith, chair of the Mercury Prize judging panel, has said that albums are chosen because they are the &quot;strongest&quot; each year, rather than according to genre. However, the presence of classical, folk and jazz recordings has been cited by some as anomalous, arguing that comparisons with the other nominees can be invidious. Classical acts to have an album nominated have included John Tavener, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gavin Bryars and Nicholas Maw. None has ever won, and there has not been a shortlisted classical album since 2002.

The Mercury Prize also has a reputation for being awarded to outside chances rather than the favourites. The 1994 award winner was &quot;Elegant Slumming&quot; by the pop act M People, which some felt was a controversial decision considering the shortlist included popular albums from Britpop figureheads Paul Weller, Blur and Pulp, and electronica band The Prodigy.

Other music journalists critical of the awards stated that the 2005 award should not have been given to Antony and the Johnsons for their album &quot;I Am a Bird Now&quot; as, although they are British-born and therefore eligible for the Prize, the band was based in the United States. In 2006, Isobel Campbell&#x27;s collaboration with Mark Lanegan, &quot;Ballad of the Broken Seas&quot;, was included in the shortlist, despite Lanegan being American, as the album was eligible due to Campbell&#x27;s British citizenship, while Guillemots, whose album was also shortlisted in 2006, contained band members from Brazil and Canada, although the majority were from the United Kingdom.

Current eligibility criteria state that all albums must be available to buy as a digital release in the UK. In September 2013, My Bloody Valentine vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields expressed concerns about the award in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, accusing the Mercury Prize&#x27;s organisers of &quot;banning&quot; the band&#x27;s self-released album, &quot;m b v&quot;, from the shortlist nominations and addressing the nomination criteria, which he claimed branded the album &quot;virtually illegal&quot;.

It has also been noted that heavy metal has been overlooked by the prize. A 2013 article by &quot;Vice&quot; on the Mercury Prize said &quot;Metal certainly never gets a look-in, not even on the official entry information form: &#x27;The Prize is open to all types of music, including pop, rock, folk, hip-hop, R&#x27;n&#x27;B, dance, soul, jazz, blues, electronica, classical…&#x27;&quot; The only metal record that has ever been nominated for the Mercury Prize is &quot;Troublegum&quot; by Therapy? in 1994. In 2011, Mercury chair of judges Frith said &quot;[Metal] is a niche that a lot of people don&#x27;t listen to.&quot; In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; music critic Alexis Petridis agreed that the Mercury Prize underrepresented heavy metal, but argued that this actually benefitted the genre because &quot;At least part of metal&#x27;s appeal is its outsider status.&quot;

<text>The Northwest Ordinance (formally An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States, North-West of the River Ohio and also known as the Ordinance of 1787), enacted July 13, 1787, was an organic act of the Congress of the Confederation of the United States. It created the Northwest Territory, the new nation&#x27;s first organized incorporated territories between British North America and the Great Lakes to the north and the Ohio River to the south. The upper Mississippi River formed the territory&#x27;s western boundary. Pennsylvania was the eastern boundary.

In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded the region to the United States. However, the Confederation Congress faced numerous problems gaining control of the land such as the unsanctioned movement of American settlers into the Ohio Valley; violent resistance from the region&#x27;s indigenous peoples; the continued presence of British outposts in the region and an empty U.S. treasury. The ordinance superseded the Land Ordinance of 1784, which declared that states would one day be formed within the region, and the Land Ordinance of 1785, which described how the Confederation Congress would sell the land to private citizens. Designed to serve as a plan for the development and settlement of the region, the 1787 ordinance lacked a strong central government to implement it. That need was addressed shortly with the formation of the U.S. federal government in 1789. The First Congress reaffirmed the 1787 ordinance and, with slight modifications, renewed it with the Northwest Ordinance of 1789.

Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress, it established the precedent by which the federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the Articles of Confederation. It also set legislative precedent with regard to American public domain lands. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the authority of the Northwest Ordinance of 1789 within the applicable Northwest Territory as constitutional in &quot;Strader v. Graham&quot;, but it did not extend the ordinance to cover the respective states once they were admitted to the Union.

The prohibition of slavery in the territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as the geographic divide between slave states and free states from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River, an extension of the Mason–Dixon line. It also helped set the stage for later federal political conflicts over slavery during the 19th century until the American Civil War.

==Background==

The territory was acquired by Great Britain from France after the former&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War and during the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Britain took over the Ohio Country, as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later, King George III forbade all settlements in the region by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The Crown tried to restrict the settlement of the Thirteen Colonies to the area between the Appalachians and the Atlantic Ocean, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. In 1774, Britain annexed the region to its Province of Quebec. With the Patriots&#x27; victory in the American Revolutionary War and the signing of the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the United States claimed the territory as well as the areas south of Ohio. The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting claims of the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border areas until after the Louisiana Purchase and the War of 1812.

The region had long been desired for expansion by American settlers. The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the U.S. federal government&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; opening of the area to settlement after the defeat of Great Britain. In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, as delegate from Virginia, proposed for the states to relinquish their particular claims to all territory west of the Appalachians and for the area to be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson&#x27;s proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the Articles of Confederation. Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: &quot;Cherronesus&quot;, &quot;Sylvania&quot;, &quot;Assenisipia&quot;, &quot;Illinoia&quot;, &quot;Metropotamia&quot;, &quot;Polypotamia&quot;, &quot;Pelisipia&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Michigania&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;. The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal and passed it as the Land Ordinance of 1784, which established the example that would become the basis for the Northwest Ordinance three years later.

The 1784 ordinance was criticized by George Washington in 1785 and James Monroe in 1786. Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance&#x27;s plan for organizing governments in new states and worried that the new states&#x27; relatively small sizes would undermine the original states&#x27; power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.

When it was passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson. It called for dividing the territory into gridded townships so that once the lands were surveyed, they could be sold to individuals and speculative land companies. That would provide both a new source of federal government revenue and an orderly pattern for future settlement.

==Effects==
===Land ownership===
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the concept of fee simple ownership by which ownership was in perpetuity, with unlimited power to sell or give it away. That was called the &quot;first guarantee of freedom of contract in the United States.&quot;

===Abolition and transfer of state claims===

Passage of the ordinance, which ceded all unsettled lands to the federal government and established the public domain, followed the relinquishing of all such claims over the territory by the states. The territories were to be administered directly by Congress, with the intent of their eventual admission as newly created states. The legislation was revolutionary in that it established the precedent for new lands to be administered by the central government, albeit temporarily, rather than under the jurisdiction of the individually-sovereign original states, as under the Articles of Confederation. The legislation also broke colonial precedent by defining future use of the natural navigation, transportation and communication routes. It did so in a way that anticipated future acquisitions beyond the Northwest Territories and established federal policy. Article 4 stated: &quot;The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other States that may be admitted into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.&quot;

===Admission of new states===
The most significant intended purpose of the legislation was its mandate for the creation of new states from the region. It provided that at least three but not more than five states would be established in the territory and that once such a state achieved a population of 60,000, it would be admitted into representation in the Continental Congress on an equal footing with the original thirteen states. The first state created from the Northwest Territory was Ohio in 1803, and the remaining territory was renamed Indiana Territory. The other four states were Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A portion (about a third) of what later became Minnesota was also part of the territory.

===Education===

The 1787 ordinance encouraged education, stipulating that &quot;Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot; This built on the 1785 ordinance, which had specified that each township should set aside land that would be rented out to support public schools. In 1786, Manasseh Cutler became interested in the settlement of western lands by American pioneers to the Northwest Territory. The following year, as agent of the Ohio Company of Associates, which he had been involved in creating, he organized a contract with Congress whereby his associates, former soldiers of the Revolutionary War, might purchase of land at the mouth of the Muskingum River with their Certificate of Indebtedness. Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate Nathan Dane. For the smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company. By changing the office of provisional governor from being elected to appointed, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.

In 1797, settlers from Marietta traveled upstream via the Hocking River to establish a location for the school and chose Athens for its location directly between Chillicothe and Marietta. Originally named in 1802 as the American Western University, the school never opened. Instead, Ohio University was formally established on February 18, 1804, when its charter was approved by the Ohio General Assembly. Its establishment came 11 months after Ohio was admitted to the Union. The first three students enrolled in 1809. Ohio University graduated two students with bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1815.

===Establishment of territorial government===
While the population of free, male inhabitants of a territory was less than 5,000, there would be a limited form of government: a governor, a secretary, and three judges, all being appointed by Congress. The governor, appointed for a three-year term and given a &quot;freehold estate therein, in one thousand acres of land,&quot; would be the commander-in-chief of the militia, appoint magistrates and other civil officers, and help create and publish laws. The secretary, appointed for a four-year term and given a similar freehold estate as the governor but of five hundred acres, would be in charge of keeping and preserving the acts and laws passed by the territorial legislatures, keep the public records of the district, and transmit authentic copies of such acts and proceedings every six months to the secretary of the Continental Congress. Three judges, who would be appointed indefinitely &quot;during good behaviour&quot; and be given the same freehold as the secretary, would be in charge of helping the governor create and pass acts and laws and in making official court rulings.

Once the population of a territory reached 5,000 free, male inhabitants, it would receive the authority to elect representatives from counties or townships to a territorial general assembly. For every 500 free males, there would be one representative until there were 25 representatives. Then, Congress would control the number and proportion of the representatives from that legislature. No male could be a representative unless he was a citizen of the United States for at least three years or lived in the district for three years and owned at least 200 acres of land within the same district. The representatives would serve for a term of two years. If a representative died or was removed from office, a new one would be elected to serve out the remaining time.

===Establishment of natural rights===
The natural rights provisions of the ordinance foreshadowed the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Many of the concepts and guarantees of the Ordinance of 1787 were incorporated in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In the Northwest Territory, various legal and property rights were enshrined, religious tolerance was proclaimed, and since &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot; The right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; was written into the charter, as were freedom of religion and bans on excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment. Trial by jury and a ban on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws were also rights that were recognized.

===Prohibition of slavery===
At the time, no one claimed being responsible for this article. Sometime later, Nathan Dane of Massachusetts claimed he wrote it, and Manasseh Cutler told his son Ephraim Cutler that he wrote it. Historian David McCullough discounts Dane&#x27;s claim because Dane was not a good writer. The language of the ordinance prohibits slavery but also contains a clear fugitive slave clause. An attempt to add limited slavery to the proposed constitution of Ohio in 1802 was defeated after a major effort led by Ephraim Cutler, who represented Marietta, the town founded by the Ohio Company.

Efforts in the 1820s by proponents of slavery to legalize slavery in two of the states (Illinois and Indiana) created from the Northwest Territory failed, but an &quot;indentured servant&quot; law allowed some slaveholders to bring slaves under that status who could not be bought or sold. Southern states voted for the law because they did not want to compete with the territory over tobacco as a commodity crop since it was so labor-intensive that it was grown profitably only with slave labor. Also, slave states&#x27; political power would be merely equalized since there were three more slave states than there were free states in 1790.

The Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in 1865, which outlawed slavery throughout the United States, quotes verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance.

===Effects on Native Americans===
In two parts, the Northwest Ordinance mentions the Native Americans within the region. One pertains to the demarcation of counties and townships out of lands that the Indians were regarded as having lost or relinquished title:

The other describes the preferred relationship with the Indians:

Many Native Americans in Ohio who were not parties refused to acknowledge treaties signed after the Revolutionary War that ceded lands north of the Ohio River inhabited by them to the United States. In a conflict sometimes known as the Northwest Indian War, Blue Jacket of the Shawnees and Little Turtle of the Miamis formed a confederation to stop white expropriation of the territory. After the Indian confederation killed more than 800 soldiers in two battles, the worst defeats ever suffered by the United States in conflicts with Indigenous nations, U.S. President George Washington assigned General Anthony Wayne command of a new army, which eventually defeated the confederation and allowed European Americans to continue to settle the territory.

<text>The Daily Bugle (at one time The DB!) is a fictional New York City tabloid newspaper appearing as a plot element in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is a regular fixture in the Marvel Universe, most prominently in Spider-Man comic titles and their derivative media. The newspaper first appeared in the Human Torch story in &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #18 (April 1941). It returned in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #2 (January 1962), and its offices were first depicted in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1 (March 1963).

The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; was first featured on film in the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. The fictional newspaper is meant to be a pastiche of both the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot;, two popular real-life New York City tabloids. The outlet appears in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy (2002–07), Marc Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; duology (2012–14) and Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (2018–present). The agency is reimagined as a sensationalist news website in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), the SSU film &quot;&quot; (2021), and the web series &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; (2019–present), headlined by J. K. Simmons and Angourie Rice as J. Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant. An alternate version of the web series hosted by Nicque Marina was featured in promotional material for the SSU film &quot;Morbius&quot; (2022).

==Publishing history==
The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is featured prominently in many Marvel Comics titles, especially those in which Spider-Man is the lead character. In 1996, a three-issue (black and white) limited series was printed.

Since 2006, Marvel has published a monthly &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; newspaper reporting on the company&#x27;s publications and authors. Marvel earlier used the newspaper format to promote Marvel&#x27;s crossover events &quot;Civil War&quot; and &quot;House of M&quot;—reporting on storyline events as if the comic book &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; had come to life. Marvel restored this promotional function for the 2007 death of Captain America.

==Fictional History==
The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; was founded in 1898 and has been published daily ever since. The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is printed in tabloid format like its rival the &quot;Daily Globe&quot;. The editor and publisher of the &quot;Bugle&quot;, J. Jonah Jameson, began his journalistic career as a reporter for the &quot;Bugle&quot; while still in high school. Jameson purchased the then-floundering &quot;Bugle&quot; with inheritance funds, from his recently deceased father-in-law and turned the paper into a popular success. Other magazines published from time-to-time include the revived &quot;Now&quot; magazine and the now-defunct &quot;Woman&quot; magazine, edited by Carol Danvers.

J. Jonah Jameson, Inc. purchased the Goodman Building on 39th Street and Second Avenue in 1936 and moved its entire editorial and publishing facilities there. Now called the Daily Bugle Building, the office complex is forty-six stories tall, and is capped by the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; logo in letters on the roof. There are loading docks in the rear of the building, reached by a back alley. Three floors are devoted to the editorial office of the &quot;Bugle&quot; and two sub-basement levels to the printing presses, while the rest of the floors are rented. (A panel in #105 of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; showed the &quot;Bugle&quot; building located near a street sign at the corner of Madison Avenue and a street in the East Fifties (the second digit was not shown). This suggests that the building may have been relocated at some point.)

The newspaper is noted for its anti-superhero slant, especially concerning Spider-Man, whom the paper constantly smears as a part of its editorial policy. However, the Editor-in-Chief, &quot;Robbie&quot; Robertson, the only subordinate to Jameson who is &quot;not&quot; intimidated by him, has worked to moderate it. More positively, the newspaper has also published important exposés of political corruption and organized crime in the city, and also takes a strong stance in favor of mutant rights, which has led to its being targeted by various criminals and hate groups.

Due to declining circulation, Jameson has conceded to Robertson&#x27;s objections and has created a special feature section of the paper called &quot;The Pulse&quot;, which focuses on superheroes. In addition, the paper also intermittently ran a glossy magazine called &quot;Now Magazine&quot;.

Soon after the team&#x27;s formation, the New Avengers decided to strike a deal with Jameson regarding exclusive content in exchange for removing the strong anti-Spider-Man sentiment from the newspaper, to which Jameson agreed. Merely one day later, Jameson broke the spirit (though not the letter) of his agreement with Iron Man, using the headline &quot;&quot;a wanted murderer&quot; (Wolverine), &quot;an alleged ex-member of a terrorist organization&quot; (Spider-Woman) &quot;and a convicted heroin-dealer&quot; (Luke Cage) &quot;are just some of the new recruits set to bury the once good name of the Avengers,&quot;&quot; but refraining from attacking Spider-Man. This prompted Jessica Jones to sell the first pictures of her newborn baby to one of the &quot;Bugle&quot;″s competitors instead.

In the first issue of &quot;Runaways&quot; (vol. 2), Victor Mancha states in an exchange about Spider-Man that &quot;The only people who think he&#x27;s a criminal are Fox News and the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. And the &quot;Bugle&quot; is, like, the least respected newspaper in New York City.&quot; The paper&#x27;s major named competitors are the &quot;Daily Globe&quot;, which implicitly takes a more balanced look at superheroes, &quot;Front Line&quot;, run by EIC Ben Urich and Sally Floyd, and &quot;The Alternative&quot;. After Peter Parker revealed that he is Spider-Man and the &quot;Bugle&quot; planned to sue him for fraud, the paper itself was put on the defensive with front page accusations from the &quot;Globe&quot; (with information secretly supplied by &quot;Bugle&quot; reporter Betty Brant) of libeling the superhero.

The adventures of the staff of the newspaper beyond Peter Parker have been depicted in two series, &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; and &quot;The Pulse&quot;.

===&quot;The DB&quot;===

After Jameson suffered a near-fatal heart attack, his wife sold the &quot;Bugle&quot; to rival newspaper man Dexter Bennett, who changed the name to The DB! (either standing for Dexter Bennett or &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;), and transformed it into a scandal sheet. Since after &quot;Brand New Day&quot; no one knows the secret identity of Spider-Man anymore, the animosity between Jameson and Parker is retconned as a simple financial question, with Jameson&#x27;s heart attack coming right after a monetary request from Peter.

The reputation of the &quot;DB!&quot; since the mention in &quot;Runaways&quot; (vol. 2) has plummeted downward because of the new, scandalistic angle Bennett gives it. Several reporters unwilling, or refusing the new course, like Peter himself, are forced to go away, finding a new safe haven in the &quot;Front Line&quot;, the only magazine willing to accept people that were fired by Bennett, pursuing a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy over them.

The villain Electro targeted Dexter Bennett because of a government bailout plan for the financially strapped paper. Spider-Man intervened, and during a battle inside the &quot;DB!&quot; offices, the entire building was demolished, bringing an end to the newspaper as well.

===&quot;Front Line&quot;===
Front Line was a newspaper founded and run by Ben Urich and Sally Floyd. The organization was formed in &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot; #11 as Frontlines.com. The newspaper appeared in the miniseries &quot;World War Hulk: Front Line&quot; and &quot;Siege: Embedded&quot;. Originally it was not competitive with the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; while Jameson was still in charge, but it became an alternative view to &quot;The DB!&quot; once Bennett took control.

===Reborn===
Sometime after the &quot;DB!&quot;″s destruction, Jameson, now the mayor of New York, cashed in the &quot;DB!&quot; shares that he acquired from Bennett and gave the money to Robbie Robertson. Jameson asked Robertson to remake &quot;Front Line&quot; (which itself was on hard times) into the new &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;.

* The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; appears in the 1994 film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;.

== Other versions ==
=== Age of Apocalypse ===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline, the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is a clandestine paper run by humans meant to inform the public about the secrets of Apocalypse, here the tyrannical ruler of North America. This &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is run by Robbie Robertson, who is killed by a Brood-infected Christopher Summers, leaving the status of the paper unknown.

=== Amalgam Comics===
The &quot;Gotham Bugle&quot; (an amalgamation of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; and DC Comics&#x27; the &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot;) appears in the &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot; world. Similar to the mainstream &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, employees include J. Jonah White, Jimmy Urich, Tana Moon, Jack Ryder and Spider-Boy. In this world, the &quot;Gotham Bugle&quot; regularly produces cover stories revolving around Spider-Boy&#x27;s love life.

=== 1602 ===
In the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; setting, Jameson is publisher of the first &quot;news-sheet&quot; in the New World; the &quot;Daily Trumpet&quot;.

=== House of M ===
In this alternate reality, the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; exists mostly as a propaganda machine for the ruling mutant hierarchy. Stories can be and are repressed if they aren&#x27;t favorable enough to mutants. In this reality, a blue-skinned woman named Cerena Taylor is the editor-in-chief. Other staff members include Bugman (the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;&#x27;s paparazzi driver), Jacob Guntherson (the Daily Bugle&#x27;s photographer), and Triporter (the Daily Bugle&#x27;s three-eyed reporter).

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe, the &quot;Bugle&quot; is much the same as in the 616 version. The main difference is that Peter Parker is not employed as a photographer, but works on the newspaper&#x27;s website after Jameson sees him assist with a problem. The newspaper plays less of a role in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; than it did in the comics portraying the equivalent period of the 616 Spider-Man&#x27;s career. Peter frequently implies that he doesn&#x27;t spend much time there. After the events of Ultimatum, the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, much like the rest of New York, was heavily damaged. Instead of a full rebuild, the &quot;Bugle&quot; was made into an online newspaper and blog.

=== Ultimate Universe ===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is shown to be owned by Wilson Fisk who is loyal to Maker and his council. J. Jonah Jameson and Ben Parker were depicted as employees of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; until they resigned upon being disgusted at nobody wanting to investigate Tony Stark&#x27;s &quot;attack on New York City&quot;.

<doc id="141008" wikidata="Q184213" url="?curid=141008" title="Akashi Kaikyo Bridge">
<text>The is a suspension bridge which links the city of Kobe on the Japanese island of Honshu and on Awaji Island. It is part of the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway, and crosses the busy and turbulent Akashi Strait (&quot;Akashi Kaikyō&quot; in Japanese). It was completed in 1998, and at the time, was the longest central span of any suspension bridge in the world, at . Currently, it is the second-longest, behind the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge in Turkey that was opened in March 2022.

The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is one of the key links of the Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project, which created three routes across the Seto Inland Sea.

==History==
===Background===

The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge forms part of the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway, the easternmost route of the bridge system linking the islands of Honshu and Shikoku. The bridge crosses the Akashi Strait (width 4 km) between Kobe on Honshu and Iwaya on Awaji Island; the other major part of the crossing is completed by the Ōnaruto Bridge, which links Awaji Island to Ōge Island across the Naruto Strait.

Before the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge was built, ferries carried passengers across the Akashi Strait. A major passageway for shipping, it is also known for its gales, heavy rain, storms, and other natural disasters. The in stormy weather in December 1945, while carrying more than three times its capacity of 100 passengers, killed 304 people, first stirring public discussion on the possibility of a bridge over the span. In 1955, two ferries sank in the Shiun Maru disaster during a storm, killing 168 people. The ensuing shock and public outrage convinced the Japanese government to develop plans for a bridge to cross the strait.

===Investigations===

Investigations for a bridge across the strait were first conducted by the Kobe municipal government in 1957, followed by an evaluation by the national Ministry of Construction in 1959. In 1961, the Ministry of Construction and Japan National Railways jointly commissioned the Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE) to conduct a technical study, and the JSCE established a committee to investigate five potential routes between Honshu and Shikoku. In 1967, the committee compiled the results of the technical study, concluding that a bridge across the Akashi Strait would face &quot;extremely severe design and construction conditions, which have no similar examples in the world&#x27;s long-span bridges&quot; and recommending an additional study.

In response to the report, the Honshu–Shikoku Bridge Authority (now the Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Expressway Company) was established in 1970, which conducted extensive investigations, including sea trials to establish the construction method of a submarine foundation. In 1973, a bridge with a central span of 1,780 meters on the route was approved, but construction was halted due to poor economic conditions.

===Construction===

The original plan called for a mixed railway-road bridge, but when construction on the bridge began in April 1988, it was restricted to road only, with six lanes. Actual construction did not begin until May 1988 and involved more than 100 contractors. The Great Hanshin Earthquake in January 1995 did not do substantial damage to the bridge due to anti-seismic building methods. Construction was finished on time in September 1996. The bridge was opened for traffic on April 5, 1998, in a ceremony officiated by the then-Crown Prince Naruhito and his spouse Crown Princess Masako of Japan along with Construction Minister Tsutomu Kawara. The bridge was the last Japanese megaprojects of the 20th century.

==Structure==

===Substructures===
The bridge has four substructures: two main piers (located beneath the water) and two anchorages (on land). These are denoted 1A, 2P, 3P, and 4A in sequence from the Kobe side. 1A consists of an underground circular retaining wall filled with roller-compacted concrete, 2P and 3P are circular underwater spread-foundation caisson structures, and 4A is a rectangular direct foundation. 2P is located at the edge of the sea plateau at a level depth of 40–50 m and a bearing depth of 60 m, and 3P is located at the symmetrical point to 2P with respect to the bridge&#x27;s center, at a level depth of 36–39 m and a bearing depth of 57 m.

The towers are located in an area of strong tidal currents where water velocity exceeds 7 knots (about 3.6 m/s). The selected scour protection measure includes the installation of a filtering layer with a thickness of 2 m in a range of 10 m around the caisson, covered with riprap of 8 m thick.

===Superstructures===

The bridge has three spans. The central span is , and the two other sections are each . The bridge is long overall. The two towers were originally apart, but the Great Hanshin earthquake on January 17, 1995 (magnitude 7.3, with epicenter 20 km west of Kobe) moved the towers (the only structures that had been erected at the time) such that the central span had to be increased by . The central span was required to be greater than 1,500 m to accommodate maritime traffic; it was concluded before construction began that a larger span between 1950 and 2050 meters would minimize construction costs.

The bridge was designed with a dual-hinged stiffening girder system, allowing the structure to withstand winds of , earthquakes measuring up to magnitude 8.5, and harsh sea currents. The bridge also contains tuned mass dampers that are designed to operate at the resonance frequency of the bridge to damp forces. The two main supporting towers rise above sea level, and the bridge can expand because of heat by up to over the course of a day. Each anchorage required of concrete. The steel cables have of wire: each cable is in diameter and contains 36,830 strands of wire.

The Akashi–Kaikyo bridge has a total of 1,737 illumination lights: 1,084 for the main cables, 116 for the main towers, 405 for the girders and 132 for the anchorages. Sets of three high-intensity discharge lamps in the colors red, green and blue are mounted on the main cables. The RGB color model and computer technology make for a variety of combinations. Twenty-eight patterns are used for occasions such as national or regional holidays, memorial days or festivities.

==Cost==
The total cost is estimated at ¥500 billion or US$3.6 billion (per 1998 exchange rates). It is expected to be repaid by charging drivers a toll to cross the bridge. The toll is 2,300 yen and the bridge is used by approximately 23,000 cars per day.

<text>The Toronto Star is a Canadian English-language broadsheet daily newspaper. It is owned by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation and part of Torstar&#x27;s Daily News Brands division.

The newspaper was established in 1892 as the Evening Star and was later renamed the Toronto Daily Star in 1900, under Joseph E. Atkinson. Atkinson was a major influence in shaping the editorial stance of the paper, with the paper reflecting his principles until his death in 1948. His son-in-law, Harry C. Hindmarsh, shared those principles as the paper&#x27;s longtime managing editor while also helping to build circulation with sensational stories, bold headlines and dramatic photos. The paper was renamed the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 1971 and introduced a Sunday edition in 1977.

==History==
The &quot;Star&quot; was created in 1892 by striking &quot;Toronto News&quot; printers and writers, led by future mayor of Toronto and social reformer Horatio Clarence Hocken, who became the newspaper&#x27;s founder, along with another future mayor, Jimmy Simpson.

The &quot;Star&quot; was first printed on &quot;Toronto World&quot; presses, and at its formation, &quot;The World&quot; owned a 51 percent interest in it as a . That arrangement only lasted for two months, during which time it was rumoured that William Findlay &quot;Billy&quot; Maclean, &quot;The World&quot;″s proprietor, was considering selling the &quot;Star&quot; to the Riordon family. After an extensive fundraising campaign among the &quot;Star&quot; staff, Maclean agreed to sell his interest to Hocken.

The paper did poorly in its first few years. Hocken sold out within the year, and several owners followed in succession until railway entrepreneur William Mackenzie bought it in 1896. Its new editors, Edmund E. Sheppard and Frederic Thomas Nicholls, moved the entire &quot;Star&quot; operation into the same building used by the magazine &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

===Under Atkinson===

Joseph E. &quot;Holy Joe&quot; Atkinson, backed by funds raised by supporters of Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, bought the paper on December 13, 1899. The supporters included Senator George Cox, William Mulock, Peter Charles Larkin and Timothy Eaton. Atkinson became the controlling shareholder of the &quot;Star&quot;. The &quot;Star&quot; was frequently criticized for practising the yellow journalism of its era. For decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with advocating social change.

Atkinson was the &quot;Star&quot;″s editor from 1899 until his death in 1948. The newspaper&#x27;s early opposition and criticism of the Nazi regime saw it become one of the first North American papers to be banned in Germany. Atkinson had a social conscience. He championed many causes that would come to be associated with the modern welfare state: old age pensions, unemployment insurance, and health care. The Government of Canada Digital Collections website describes Atkinson as:
a &quot;radical&quot; in the best sense of that term... The &quot;Star&quot; was unique among North American newspapers in its consistent, ongoing advocacy of the interests of ordinary people. The friendship of Atkinson, the publisher, with Mackenzie King, the prime minister, was a major influence on the development of Canadian social policy.

Shortly before his death in 1948, Joseph E. Atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper&#x27;s liberal tradition. In 1949, the Province of Ontario passed the &quot;Charitable Gifts Act&quot;, barring charitable organizations from owning large parts of profit-making businesses, that effectively required the &quot;Star&quot; to be sold.

Atkinson&#x27;s will had directed that profits from the paper&#x27;s operations were &quot;for the promotion and maintenance of social, scientific and economic reforms which are charitable in nature, for the benefit of the people of the province of Ontario&quot; and it stipulated that the paper could be sold only to people who shared his social views. The five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the Act by buying the paper themselves and swearing before the Supreme Court of Ontario to continue what became known as the &quot;Atkinson Principles&quot;:
* A strong, united and independent Canada
* Social justice
* Individual and civil liberties
* Community and civic engagement
* The rights of working people
* The necessary role of government

These principles continue to affect the &quot;Star&quot;″s editorial stances. In February 2006, &quot;Star&quot; media columnist Antonia Zerbisias wrote on her blog:
Besides, we are the &quot;Star&quot; which means we all have the Atkinson Principles—and its multi-culti values—tattooed on our butts. Fine with me. At least we are upfront about our values, and they almost always work in favour of building a better Canada.

====Other early media ventures====
Under Atkinson, the &quot;Star&quot; launched several other media initiatives, including a weekend supplemental magazine, the &quot;Star Weekly&quot;, from 1910 to 1973. From 1922 to 1933, the &quot;Star&quot; was also a radio broadcaster on its station CFCA, broadcasting on a wavelength of 400 metres (749.48 kHz); its coverage was complementary to the paper&#x27;s reporting. The station was closed following the establishment of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) and the introduction of a government policy that, in essence, restricted private stations to an effective radiated power of 100 watts. The &quot;Star&quot; would continue to supply sponsored content to the CRBC&#x27;s CRCT station—which later became CBC station CBL—an arrangement that lasted until 1946.

===1971–present===
In 1971, the newspaper was renamed &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; and moved to a modern International-style office tower at One Yonge Street by Queens Quay. The original &quot;Star&quot; building at 80 King Street West was demolished to make room for First Canadian Place.

The &quot;Star&quot; expanded during the 1970s with the introduction of a Sunday edition in 1973 and a morning edition in 1981.

In 1992, its printing plant was moved to the Toronto Star Press Centre at the Highway 407 &amp; 400 interchange in Vaughan. In September 2002, the logo was changed, and &quot;The&quot; was dropped from the masthead. During the 2003 Northeast blackout, the &quot;Star&quot; printed the paper at a press in Welland, Ontario. The newspaper&#x27;s former printing plant was housed at One Yonge Street until the Toronto Star Press Centre opened.

Until the mid-2000s, the front page of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; had no third-party advertising aside from upcoming lottery jackpot estimates from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).

On May 28, 2007, the &quot;Star&quot; unveiled a redesigned paper that featured larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections, a more prominent focus on local news, and less focus on international news, columnists, and opinion pieces. However, on January 1, 2009, the &quot;Star&quot; reverted to its previous format. &quot;Star P.M.&quot;, a free newspaper in PDF format that could be downloaded from the newspaper&#x27;s website each weekday afternoon, was discontinued in October 2007, thirteen months after its launch.

On January 15, 2016, Torstar confirmed the closure of its Vaughan printing presses and indicated that it would outsource printing to Transcontinental Printing, leading to the layoff of all 285 staff at the plant, as Transcontinental had its own existing facility, also in Vaughan. The newspaper said the closure was effected so it could better focus on its digital outlets.
In February 2018, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; suspended its internship program indefinitely to cut its costs. Long a source of Canada&#x27;s next generation of journalists, the paid positions were seen by journalists and program alumni as a vital part of the national industry, and their suspension, a sign of its continuing decline. In 2020, the internship program returned.

In April 2018, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; expanded its local coverage of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax with rebranded daily newspapers, previously known as &quot;Metro&quot;, as &quot;StarMetro&quot;, which was a joint venture between Torstar (90%) and Swedish media company Metro International (10%). In October 2018, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; acquired iPolitics, a political news outlet. It ceased to own the property in 2022.

On December 20, 2019, all &quot;StarMetro&quot; editions ceased publication amid the popularity and resultant growth of news apps on mobile devices.

The newspaper was acquired by NordStar Capital on May 26, 2020, after the board of Torstar voted to sell the company to the investment firm for —making Torstar a privately held company. The deal was expected to be approved by Torstar&#x27;s shareholders and to close by the end of 2020. Canadian Modern Media Holdings made an offer of $58million on July 9, 2020; NordStar subsequently increased its offer to $60million, effectively ending the bidding war. A vast majority of shareholders subsequently voted in favour of the deal. The takeover was approved by an Ontario judge on July 27, 2020. An appeal of the judgement by another prospective purchaser failed on July 31 when Ontario Superior Court Justice Michael Penny dismissed the motion. The deal was expected to close during the following week.

In November 2022, the newspaper moved its headquarters from the Toronto Star Building located on Yonge Street to a new location on Spadina Avenue at Front Street. 

==Content==
===Editorial position===
Like its competitor &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Star&quot; covers &quot;a spectrum of opinion that is best described as urban and Central Canadian&quot; in character. The &quot;Star&quot; is generally centrist and centre-left, and is more socially liberal than &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. The paper has aligned itself over the years with the progressive &quot;Atkinson principles&quot; named for publisher Joseph E. Atkinson, who was editor and publisher of the paper for 50 years. These principles included social justice and social welfare provision, as well as individual rights and civil liberties. In 1984, scholar Wilfred H. Kesterton described the &quot;Star&quot; as &quot;perpetually indignant&quot; because of its social consciousness. When Atkinson&#x27;s son Joseph Story Atkinson became president of the &quot;Star&quot; in 1957, he said, &quot;From its inception in 1892, the &quot;Star&quot; has been a champion of social and economic reform, a defender of minority rights, a foe of discrimination, a friend of organized labour and a staunch advocate of Canadian nationhood.&quot;

Another of the &quot;Atkinson principles&quot; has been a &quot;strong, united and independent Canada&quot;; in a 1927 editorial, the paper wrote, &quot;We believe in the British connection as much as anybody does but on a self-respecting basis of equality, of citizenship, and not on the old basis of one country belonging to the other.&quot; The paper was historically wary of American influence, and during the debates over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the paper was frequently critical of free trade and expressed concerns about Canadian sovereignty. The paper has been traditionally supportive of official bilingualism and maintaining Canadian unity in opposition to Quebec separatism.

In the 1980s, Michael Farber wrote in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; that the &quot;Star&quot;″s coverage was Toronto-centric to the point that any story was said to carry an explanation as to &quot;What it means to Metro.&quot; Conversely, Canadian sociologist Elke Winter wrote in 2011 that the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; was less &quot;Toronto-centric&quot; than its rival, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, writing that the &quot;Star&quot; &quot;consciously reports for and from Canada&#x27;s most multicultural city&quot; and catered to a diverse readership.

The advent of the &quot;National Post&quot; in 1998 shook up the Toronto newspaper market. In the upheaval that followed, editorial spending increased and there was much turnover of editors and publishers.

====Election endorsements====
In the 50 years to 1972, the &quot;Star&quot; endorsed the Liberal Party in each federal general election. In the fifteen federal elections between 1968 and 2019, the &quot;Star&quot; has endorsed the Liberal Party eleven times, the New Democratic Party twice, and the Progressive Conservative Party twice.

Elections in which the &quot;Star&quot; did not endorse the Liberals took place in 1972 and 1974 (when it endorsed the Progressive Conservatives), and 1979 and 2011 (when it endorsed the NDP). In the 2011 election, the &quot;Star&quot; endorsed the NDP under Jack Layton, but to avoid vote splitting that could inadvertently help the Conservatives under Stephen Harper, which it saw as the worst outcome for the country, the paper also recommended Canadians vote strategically by voting for &quot;the progressive candidate best placed to win&quot; in certain ridings. For the 2015 election, the &quot;Star&quot; endorsed the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau, and did so again in the 2019 federal election.

In Toronto&#x27;s non-partisan mayoral elections, the &quot;Star&quot; endorsed George Smitherman in 2010 and John Tory in 2014 and 2018.

===Features===
The &quot;Star&quot; is one of the few Canadian newspapers that employs a &quot;public editor&quot; (ombudsman) and was the first to do so. Its newsroom policy and journalistic standards guide is also published online.

The &quot;Star&quot; states that it favours an inclusive, &quot;big tent&quot; approach, not wishing to attract one group of readers at the expense of others. It publishes regular features on real estate (including condominiums), individual neighbourhoods (and street name etymologies), shopping, cooking, dining, alcoholic beverages (right down to having an exclusive on the anti-competitive practices of the Beer Store that led to major reforms on the sale of alcohol in Ontario grocery stores in 2015 by Premier Kathleen Wynne and Ed Clark), automobiles (as Wheels), and travel destinations.

==Products==
===Website===
The &quot;Star&quot; launched its website in 1996. In October 2012, the &quot;Star&quot; announced its intention to implement a paywall on its website, thestar.com, effective August 13, 2013. Readers with daily home delivery had free access to all digital content. Those without a digital subscription could access 10 articles a month. The &quot;Star&quot; removed its paywall on April 1, 2015, and revived it in 2018.

===Mobile app===
On September 15, 2015, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; released the Star Touch tablet app, which was a free interactive news app with interactive advertisements. It was discontinued in 2017. At launch, it was only available for the iPad, which uses iOS. Based on a similar app for Montreal-based released in 2013, Star Touch is the first such app for any English-language news organization, quality-wise. In slightly over 50 days since launch, the app had reached the 100,000-download milestone. The Android version was launched on December 1, 2015. The iOS version is rated 12+ by Apple&#x27;s App Store guidelines and the Android version is rated Mature 17+ by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).

<text>Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (; 14 July 1816 – 13 October 1882) was a French writer and diplomat who is best known for helping introduce scientific race theory and &quot;racial demography&quot;, and for developing the theory of the Aryan master race and Nordicism. He was an elitist who, in the immediate aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848, wrote &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot;. In it he argued that aristocrats were superior to commoners and that aristocrats possessed more Aryan genetic traits because of less interbreeding with inferior races.

Gobineau was born to an aristocratic family of counts under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. He was ideologically a Legitimist who supported royalist rule by the House of Bourbon and opposed the French Revolution, democracy, and rule by the House of Orléans which came to power after the 1830 July Revolution. He began his diplomatic career in the late 1840s, and beginning in 1861, variously served as minister to Persia, Brazil, Greece, and Sweden. As a writer, Gobineau authored novels and short stories, as well as non-fiction travel writings, polemical essays and other philological and anthropological works, including his &quot;Essai&quot;. His &quot;Essai&quot; is widely discredited as pseudoscience by modern scholarship. Gobineau himself never had any qualifications in anthropology.

Although Gobineau&#x27;s writings were poorly received in France, they were quickly praised by white supremacist, pro-slavery Americans like Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze, who translated his book into English. They omitted around 1,000 pages of the original book, including those parts that negatively described Americans as a racially mixed population. Inspiring a social movement in Germany named Gobinism, his works were also influential on prominent antisemites like Richard Wagner, Wagner&#x27;s son-in-law Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the Romanian politician Professor A. C. Cuza, and leaders of the Nazi Party, who later edited and re-published his work.
==Early life and writings==
===Origins===
Gobineau came from an old well-established aristocratic family. His father, Louis de Gobineau (1784–1858), was a military officer and staunch royalist. His mother, Anne-Louise Magdeleine de Gercy, was the daughter of a non-noble royal tax official. The de Gercy family lived in the French Crown colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti) for a time in the 18th century.

Reflecting his hatred of the French Revolution, Gobineau later wrote: &quot;My birthday is July 14th, the date on which the Bastille was captured-which goes to prove how opposites may come together&quot;. As a boy and young man, Gobineau loved the Middle Ages, which he saw as a golden age of chivalry and knighthood much preferable to his own time. Someone who knew Gobineau as a teenager described him as a romantic, &quot;with chivalrous ideas and a heroic spirit, dreaming of what was most noble and most grand&quot;.

Gobineau&#x27;s father was committed to restoring the House of Bourbon and helped the royalist Polignac brothers to escape from France. As punishment he was imprisoned by Napoleon&#x27;s secret police but was freed when the Allies took Paris in 1814. During the Hundred Days the de Gobineau family fled France. After Napoleon&#x27;s final overthrow following the Battle of Waterloo, Louis de Gobineau was rewarded for his loyalty to the House of Bourbon by being made a captain in the Royal Guard of King Louis XVIII. The pay for a Royal Guardsman was very low, and the de Gobineau family struggled on his salary.

Magdeleine de Gobineau abandoned her husband for her children&#x27;s tutor Charles de La Coindière. Together with her lover she took her son and two daughters on extended wanderings across eastern France, Switzerland and the Grand Duchy of Baden. To support herself, she turned to fraud (for which she was imprisoned). His mother became a severe embarrassment to Gobineau, who never spoke to her after he turned twenty.

For the young de Gobineau, committed to upholding traditional aristocratic and Catholic values, the disintegration of his parents&#x27; marriage, his mother&#x27;s open relationship with her lover, her fraudulent acts, and the turmoil imposed by being constantly on the run and living in poverty were all very traumatic.

===Adolescence===
Gobineau spent the early part of his teenage years in the town of Inzligen where his mother and her lover were staying. He became fluent in German. As a staunch supporter of the House of Bourbon, his father was forced to retire from the Royal Guard after the July Revolution of 1830 brought House of Orléans King Louis-Philippe, &quot;Le roi citoyen&quot;, (&quot;the Citizen King&quot;) to power. He promised to reconcile the heritage of the French Revolution with the monarchy. Given his family&#x27;s history of supporting the Bourbons, the young Gobineau regarded the July Revolution as a disaster for France. His views were those of a Legitimist committed to a Catholic France ruled over by the House of Bourbon. In 1831, de Gobineau&#x27;s father took custody of his three children, and his son spent the rest of his adolescence in Lorient, in Brittany.

Gobineau disliked his father, whom he dismissed as a boring and pedantic army officer incapable of stimulating thought. Lorient had been founded in 1675 as a base for the French East India Company as King Louis XIV had grand ambitions for making France the dominant political and economic power in Asia. As those ambitions were unrealized, Gobineau developed a sense of faded glory as he grew up in a city that had been built to be the dominant hub for Europe&#x27;s trade with Asia. This dream went unrealized, as India became part of the British and not the French empire.

As a young man, Gobineau was fascinated with the Orient, as the Middle East was known in Europe in the 19th century. While studying at the Collège de Bironne in Switzerland, a fellow student recalled: &quot;All of his aspirations were towards the East. He dreamt only of mosques and minarets; he called himself a Muslim, ready to make the pilgrimage to Mecca&quot;. Gobineau loved Oriental tales by the French translator Antoine Galland, often saying he wanted to become an Orientalist. He read Arab, Turkish and Persian tales in translation, becoming what the French call a &quot;un orientaliste de pacotille&quot; (&quot;rubbish orientalist&quot;). In 1835, Gobineau failed the entrance exams to the St. Cyr military school.

In September 1835, Gobineau left for Paris with fifty francs in his pocket aiming to become a writer. He moved in with an uncle, Thibaut-Joseph de Gobineau, a Legitimist with an &quot;unlimited&quot; hatred of Louis-Philippe. Reflecting his tendency towards elitism, Gobineau founded a society of Legitimist intellectuals called &quot;Les Scelti&quot; (&quot;the elect&quot;), which included himself, the painter Guermann John (German von Bohn) and the writer Maxime du Camp.

===Early writings===
In the later years of the July Monarchy, Gobineau made his living writing serialized fiction (&quot;romans-feuilletons&quot;) and contributing to reactionary periodicals. He wrote for the &quot;Union Catholique&quot;, &quot;La Quotidienne&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Unité&quot;, and &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;. At one point in the early 1840s, Gobineau was writing an article every day for &quot;La Quotidienne&quot; to support himself. As a writer and journalist, he struggled financially and was forever looking for a wealthy patron willing to support him. As a part-time employee of the Post Office and a full-time writer, Gobineau was desperately poor.

His family background made him a supporter of the House of Bourbon, but the nature of the Legitimist movement dominated by factious and inept leaders drove Gobineau to despair, leading him to write: &quot;We are lost and had better resign ourselves to the fact&quot;. In a letter to his father, Gobineau complained of &quot;the laxity, the weakness, the foolishness and—in a word—the pure folly of my cherished party&quot;.

At the same time, he regarded French society under the House of Orléans as corrupt and self-serving, dominated by the &quot;oppressive feudalism of money&quot; as opposed to the feudalism of &quot;charity, courage, virtue and intelligence&quot; held by the &quot;ancien-régime&quot; nobility. Gobineau wrote about July Monarchy France: &quot;Money has become the principle of power and honour. Money dominates business; money regulates the population; money governs; money salves consciences; money is the criterion for judging the esteem due to men&quot;.

In this &quot;age of national mediocrity&quot; as Gobineau described it, with society going in a direction he disapproved of, the leaders of the cause to which he was committed being by his own admission foolish and incompetent, and the would-be aristocrat struggling to make ends meet by writing hack journalism and novels, he became more and more pessimistic about the future. Gobineau wrote in a letter to his father: &quot;How I despair of a society which is no longer anything, except in spirit, and which has no heart left&quot;. He complained the Legitimists spent their time feuding with one another while the Catholic Church &quot;is going over to the side of the revolution&quot;. Gobineau wrote: Gobineau struck up a friendship and had voluminous correspondence with Alexis de Tocqueville. Tocqueville praised Gobineau in a letter: &quot;You have wide knowledge, much intelligence, and the best of manners&quot;. He later gave Gobineau an appointment in the Quai d&#x27;Orsay (the French foreign ministry) while serving as foreign minister during the Second Republic of France.

====Breakthrough with Kapodistrias article====
In 1841, Gobineau scored his first major success when an article he submitted to &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; was published on 15 April 1841. Gobineau&#x27;s article was about the Greek statesman Count Ioannis Kapodistrias. At the time, &quot;La Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; was one of the most prestigious journals in Paris, and being published in it put Gobineau in the same company as George Sand, Théophile Gautier, Philarète Chasles, Alphonse de Lamartine, Edgar Quinet and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve who were all published regularly in that journal.

===On international politics===
Gobineau&#x27;s writings on international politics were generally as negative as his writings on France. He depicted Britain as a nation motivated entirely by hatred and greed and the extent of the British Empire around the globe as a source of regret. Gobineau often attacked King Louis-Phillipe for his pro-British foreign policy, writing that he had &quot;humiliated&quot; France by allowing the British Empire to become the world&#x27;s dominant power. However, reports on the poor economic state of Ireland were a source of satisfaction for Gobineau as he asserted: &quot;It is Ireland which is pushing England into the abyss of revolution&quot;.

According to Gobineau, the growing power and aggressiveness of Imperial Russia were a cause for concern. He regarded the disastrous retreat from Kabul by the British during the First Anglo-Afghan War with Afghanistan as a sign Russia would be the dominant power in Asia, writing: &quot;England, an aging nation, is defending its livelihood and its existence. Russia, a youthful nation, is following its path towards the power that it must surely gain ... The empire of the Tsars is today the power which seems to have the greatest future ... The Russian people are marching steadfastly towards a goal that is indeed known but still not completely defined&quot;. Gobineau regarded Russia as an Asian power and felt the inevitable triumph of Russia was a triumph of Asia over Europe.

He had mixed feelings about the German states, praising Prussia as a conservative society dominated by the &quot;Junkers&quot;. But he worried increasing economic growth promoted by the &quot;Zollverein&quot; (the German Customs Union) was making the Prussian middle-class more powerful. Gobineau was critical of the Austrian Empire, writing that the House of Habsburg ruled over a mixed population of ethnic Germans, Magyars, Italians, Slavic peoples, etc., and it was inevitable such a multi-ethnic society would go into decline, while the &quot;purely German&quot; Prussia was destined to unify Germany.

Gobineau was also pessimistic about Italy, writing: &quot;Shortly after the &quot;condottieri&quot; disappeared everything that had lived and flourished with them went too; wealth, gallantry, art and liberty, there remained nothing but a fertile land and an incomparable sky&quot;. Gobineau denounced Spain for rejecting &quot;a firm and natural authority, a power rooted in national liberty&quot;, predicting that without order imposed by an absolute monarchy, she was destined to sink into a state of perpetual revolution. He was dismissive of Latin America, writing with references to the wars of independence: &quot;The destruction of their agriculture, trade and finances, the inevitable consequence of long civil disorder, did not at all seem to them a price too high to pay for what they had in view. And yet who would want to claim that the half-barbarous inhabitants of Castile or the Algarve or the &quot;gauchos&quot; on the River Plate really deserve to sit as supreme legislators, in the places which they have contested against their masters with such pleasure and energy&quot;.

About the United States, Gobineau wrote: &quot;The only greatness is that of wealth, and as everyone can acquire this, its ownership is independent of any of the qualities reserved to superior natures&quot;. Gobineau wrote the United States lacked an aristocracy, with no sense of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; (&quot;nobility obligates&quot;) as existed in Europe. The American poor suffered worse than the European poor, causing the United States to be a violent society, where greed and materialism were the only values that counted. In general Gobineau was hostile towards people in the Americas, writing that who in the Old World does not know &quot;that the New World knows nothing of kings, princes and nobles?-that on those semi-virgin lands, in human societies born yesterday and scarcely yet consolidated, no one has the right or the power to call himself any greater than the very least of its citizens?&quot;

===Marriage===

In 1846, Gobineau married Clémence Gabrielle Monnerot. She had pressed for a hasty marriage as she was pregnant by their mutual friend Pierre de Serre who had abandoned her. As a practicing Catholic, she did not wish to give birth to an illegitimate child. Monnerot had been born in Martinique. As with his mother, Gobineau was never entirely certain if his wife, and hence his two daughters had black ancestors or not, as it was a common practice for French slave masters in the Caribbean to take a slave mistress. Gobineau&#x27;s opposition to slavery, which he held always resulted in harmful miscegenation to whites, may have stemmed from his own personal anxieties that his mother or his wife might have African ancestry.

== Early diplomatic work and theories on race ==
===Embittered royalist===
Gobineau&#x27;s novels and poems of the 1830s–40s were usually set in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance with aristocratic heroes who by their very existence uphold all of the values Gobineau felt were worth celebrating like honor and creativity against a corrupt, soulless middle class. His 1847 novel &quot;Ternove&quot; was the first time Gobineau linked class with race, writing &quot;Monsieur de Marvejols would think of himself, and of all members of the nobility, as of a race apart, of a superior essence, and he believed it criminal to sully this by mixture with plebeian blood.&quot; The novel, set against the backdrop of the Hundred Days of 1815, concerns the disastrous results when an aristocrat Octave de Ternove unwisely marries the daughter of a miller.

Gobineau was horrified by the Revolution of 1848 and disgusted by what he saw as the supine reaction of the European upper classes to the revolutionary challenge. Writing in the spring of 1848 about the news from Germany he noted: &quot;Things are going pretty badly ... I do not mean the dismissal of the princes—that was deserved. Their cowardice and lack of political faith make them scarcely interesting. But the peasants, there they are nearly barbarous. There is pillage, and burning, and massacre—and we are only at the beginning.&quot;

As a Legitimist, Gobineau disliked the House of Bonaparte and was displeased when Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president of the republic in 1848. However, he came to support Bonaparte as the best man to preserve order, and in 1849, when Tocqueville became Foreign Minister, his friend Gobineau became his &quot;chef de cabinet&quot;.

===Racial theories and aristocrats===

Shocked by the Revolution of 1848, Gobineau first expressed his racial theories in his 1848 epic poem &quot;Manfredine&quot;. In it he revealed his fear of the revolution being the beginning of the end of aristocratic Europe, with common folk descended from lesser breeds taking over. Reflecting his disdain for ordinary people, Gobineau said French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who conquered the Roman province of Gaul in the fifth century AD, while common French people were the descendants of racially inferior Celtic and Mediterranean people. This was an old theory first promoted in a tract by Count Henri de Boulainvilliers. He had argued that the Second Estate (the aristocracy) was of &quot;Frankish&quot; blood and the Third Estate (the commoners) were of &quot;Gaulish&quot; blood. Born after the French Revolution had destroyed the idealized &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; of his imagination, Gobineau felt a deep sense of pessimism regarding the future.

For him the French Revolution, having destroyed the racial basis of French greatness by overthrowing and in many cases killing the aristocracy, was the beginning of a long, irresistible process of decline and degeneration, which could only end with the utter collapse of European civilization. He felt what the French Revolution had begun the Industrial Revolution was finishing; industrialization and urbanization were a complete disaster for Europe.

Like many other European romantic conservatives, Gobineau looked back nostalgically at an idealized version of the Middle Ages as an idyllic agrarian society living harmoniously in a rigid social order. He loathed modern Paris, a city he called a &quot;giant cesspool&quot; full of &quot;les déracinés&quot; (&quot;the uprooted&quot;)—the criminal, impoverished, drifting men with no real home. Gobineau considered them to be the monstrous products of centuries of miscegenation ready to explode in revolutionary violence at any moment. He was an ardent opponent of democracy, which he stated was mere &quot;mobocracy&quot;—a system that allowed the utterly stupid mob the final say on running the state.

===Time in Switzerland and Germany===
From November 1849 to January 1854 Gobineau was stationed at the French legation in Bern as the First Secretary. During his time in Switzerland Gobineau wrote the majority of the &quot;Essai&quot;.

He was stationed in Hanover in the fall of 1851 as acting Chargé d&#x27;Affaires, and was impressed by the &quot;traces of real nobility&quot; he said he saw at the Hanoverian court. Gobineau especially liked the blind King George V whom he saw as a &quot;philosopher-king&quot; and to whom he dedicated the &quot;Essai&quot;s. He praised the &quot;remarkable character&quot; of Hanoverian men and likewise commended Hanoverian society as having &quot;an instinctive preference for hierarchy&quot; with the commoners always deferring to the nobility, which he explained on racial grounds.

Reflecting his lifelong interest in the Orient, Gobineau joined the &quot;Société Asiatique&quot; in 1852 and got to know several Orientalists, like Julius von Mohl, very well.

In January 1854, Gobineau was sent as First Secretary to the French legation at the Free City of Frankfurt. Of the Federal Convention of the German Confederation that sat in Frankfurt—also known as the &quot;Confederation Diet&quot;—Gobineau wrote: &quot;The Diet is a business office for the German bureaucracy—it is very far from being a real political body&quot;. Gobineau hated the Prussian representative at the Diet, Prince Otto von Bismarck, because of his advances towards Madame Gobineau. By contrast, the Austrian representative, General Anton von Prokesch-Osten became one of Gobineau&#x27;s best friends. He was a reactionary Austrian soldier and diplomat who hated democracy and saw himself as a historian and orientalist, and for all these reasons Gobineau bonded with him. It was during these periods that Gobineau began to write less often to his old liberal friend Tocqueville and more often to his new conservative friend Prokesch-Osten.

===Gobineau&#x27;s racial theories===

In his own lifetime, Gobineau was known as a novelist, a poet and for his travel writing recounting his adventures in Iran and Brazil rather than for the racial theories for which he is now mostly remembered. However, he always regarded his book &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;inégalité des races humaines&quot; (&quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot;) as his masterpiece and wanted to be remembered as its author. A firm reactionary who believed in the innate superiority of aristocrats over commoners—whom he held in utter contempt—Gobineau embraced the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism to justify aristocratic rule over racially inferior commoners.

== &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; ==
In his &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races,&quot; published in 1855, Gobineau ultimately accepts the prevailing Christian doctrine that all human beings shared the common ancestors Adam and Eve (monogenism as opposed to polygenism). He suggests, however, that &quot;nothing proves that at the first redaction of the Adamite genealogies the colored races were considered as forming part of the species&quot;; and, &quot;We may conclude that the power of producing fertile offspring is among the marks of a distinct species. As nothing leads us to believe that the human race is outside this rule, there is no answer to this argument.&quot; 

Gobineau stated he was writing about races, not individuals: examples of talented black or Asian individuals did not disprove his thesis of the supposed inferiority of the black and Asian races. He wrote: Gobineau argued that race was destiny, declaring rhetorically: 

Gobineau&#x27;s primary thesis was that European civilization flowed from Greece to Rome, and then to Germanic and contemporary civilization. He thought this corresponded to the ancient Indo-European culture, which earlier anthropologists had misconceived as &quot;Aryan&quot;—a term that only Indo-Iranians are known to have used in ancient times. This included groups classified by language like the Celts, Slavs and the Germans. Gobineau later came to use and reserve the term Aryan only for the &quot;Germanic race&quot;, and described the Aryans as &quot;la race germanique&quot;. By doing so, he presented a racist theory in which Aryans—that is Germanic people—were all that was positive.

=== Reaction to Gobineau&#x27;s essay ===
The &quot;Essai&quot; attracted mostly negative reviews from French critics, which Gobineau used as a proof of the supposed truth of his racial theories, writing &quot;the French, who are always ready to set anything afire—materially speaking—and who respect nothing, either in religion or politics, have always been the world&#x27;s greatest cowards in matters of science&quot;. However, events such as the expansion of European and American influence overseas and the unification of Germany led Gobineau to alter his opinion to believe the &quot;white race&quot; could be saved. The German-born American historian George Mosse argued that Gobineau projected his fear and hatred of the French middle and working classes onto Asian and Black people.

Summarizing Mosse&#x27;s argument, Davies argued that: &quot;The self-serving, materialistic oriental of the &quot;Essai&quot; was really an anti-capitalist&#x27;s portrait of the money-grubbing French middle class&quot; while &quot;the sensual, unintelligent and violent negro&quot; that Gobineau portrayed in the &quot;Essai&quot; was an aristocratic caricature of the French poor. In his writings on the French peasantry, Gobineau characteristically insisted in numerous anecdotes, which he said were based on personal experience, that French farmers were coarse, crude people incapable of learning, indeed of any sort of thinking beyond the most rudimentary level of thought. As the American critic Michelle Wright wrote, &quot;the peasant may inhabit the land, but they are certainly not part of it&quot;. Wright further noted the very marked similarity between Gobineau&#x27;s picture of the French peasantry and his view of blacks.

===Time in Persia===
In 1855, Gobineau left Paris to become the first secretary at the French legation in Tehran, Persia (modern Iran). He was promoted to &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; the following year. The histories of Persia and Greece had played prominent roles in the &quot;Essai&quot; and Gobineau wanted to see both places for himself. His mission was to keep Persia out of the Russian sphere of influence, but he cynically wrote: &quot;If the Persians ... unite with the western powers, they will march against the Russians in the morning, be defeated by them at noon and become their allies by evening&quot;. Gobineau&#x27;s time was not taxed by his diplomatic duties, and he spent time studying ancient cuneiform texts and learning Persian. He came to speak a &quot;kitchen Persian&quot; that allowed him to talk to Persians somewhat. (He was never fluent in Persian as he said he was.) Despite having some love for the Persians, Gobineau was shocked they lacked his racial prejudices and were willing to accept blacks as equals. He criticized Persian society for being too &quot;democratic&quot;.

Gobineau saw Persia as a land without a future destined to be conquered by the West sooner or later. For him this was a tragedy for the West. He believed Western men would all too easily be seduced by the beautiful Persian women causing more miscegenation to further &quot;corrupt&quot; the West. However, he was obsessed with ancient Persia, seeing in Achaemenid Persia a great and glorious Aryan civilization, now sadly gone. This was to preoccupy him for the rest of his life. Gobineau loved to visit the ruins of the Achaemenid period as his mind was fundamentally backward looking, preferring to contemplate past glories rather than what he saw as a dismal present and even bleaker future.

His time in Persia inspired two books: &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;état social de la Perse actuelle&quot; (1858) (&quot;Memoire on the Social State of Today&#x27;s Persia&quot;) and &quot;Trois ans en Asie&quot; (1859) (&quot;Three Years in Asia&quot;).

Gobineau was less than complimentary about modern Persia. He wrote to Prokesch-Osten that there was no &quot;Persian race&quot; as modern Persians were &quot;a breed mixed from God knows what!&quot;. He loved ancient Persia as the great Aryan civilization par excellence, however, noting that Iran means &quot;the land of the Aryans&quot; in Persian. Gobineau was less Eurocentric than one might expect in his writings on Persia, believing the origins of European civilization could be traced to Persia. He criticized western scholars for their &quot;collective vanity&quot; in being unable to admit to the West&#x27;s &quot;huge&quot; debt to Persia.

===Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze===

In 1856, two American &quot;race scientists&quot;, Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze, both ardent white supremacists, translated &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;inégalité des races humaines&quot; into English. Champions of slavery, they found in Gobineau&#x27;s anti-black writings a convenient justification for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot;. Nott and Hotze found much to approve of in the &quot;Essai&quot; such as: &quot;The Negro is the most humble and lags at the bottom of the scale. The animal character imprinted upon his brow marks his destiny from the moment of his conception&quot;. Much to Gobineau&#x27;s intense annoyance, Nott and Hotze abridged the first volume of the &quot;Essai&quot; from 1,600 pages in the French original down to 400 in English. At least part of the reason for this was because of Gobineau&#x27;s hostile picture of Americans. About American white people, Gobineau declared: Highly critical passages like this were removed from &quot;The Moral and Intellectual Diversity of Races&quot;, as the &quot;Essai&quot; was titled in English. Nott and Hotze retained only the parts relating to the alleged inherent inferiority of blacks. Likewise, they used Gobineau as a way of attempting to establish that white America was in mortal peril despite the fact that most American blacks were slaves in 1856. The two &quot;race scientists&quot; argued on the basis of the &quot;Essai&quot; that blacks were essentially a type of vicious animal, rather than human beings, and would always pose a danger to whites. The passages of the &quot;Essai&quot; where Gobineau declared that, though of low intelligence, blacks had certain artistic talents and that a few &quot;exceptional&quot; African tribal chiefs probably had a higher IQ than those of the stupidest whites were not included in the American edition. Nott and Hotze wanted nothing that might give blacks admirable human qualities. Beyond that, they argued that nation and race were the same, and that to be American was to be white. As such, the American translators argued in their introduction that just as various European nations were torn apart by nationality conflicts caused by different &quot;races&quot; living together, likewise ending slavery and granting American citizenship to blacks would cause the same sort of conflicts, but only on a much vaster scale in the United States.

===Time in Newfoundland===
In 1859, an Anglo-French dispute over the French fishing rights on the French Shore of Newfoundland led to an Anglo-French commission being sent to Newfoundland to find a resolution to the dispute. Gobineau was one of the two French commissioners dispatched to Newfoundland, an experience that he later recorded in his 1861 book &quot;Voyage à Terre-Neuve&quot; (&quot;Voyage to Newfoundland&quot;). In 1858, the Foreign Minister Count Alexandre Colonna-Walewski had tried to send Gobineau to the French legation in Beijing. He objected that as a &quot;civilized European&quot; he had no wish to go to an Asian country like China. As punishment, Walewski sent Gobineau to Newfoundland, telling him he would be fired from the Quai d&#x27;Orsay if he refused the Newfoundland assignment.

Gobineau hated Newfoundland, writing to a friend in Paris on 26 July 1859: &quot;This is an awful country. It is very cold, there is almost constant fog, and one sails between pieces of floating ice of enormous size.&quot; In his time in St. John&#x27;s, a city largely inhabited by Irish immigrants, Gobineau deployed virtually every anti-Irish cliché in his reports to Paris. He stated the Irish of St. John&#x27;s were extremely poor, undisciplined, conniving, obstreperous, dishonest, loud, violent, and usually drunk. He described several of the remote fishing settlements he visited in Utopian terms, praising them as examples of how a few hardy, tough people could make a living under very inhospitable conditions. Gobineau&#x27;s praise for Newfoundland fishermen reflected his viewpoint that those who cut themselves off from society best preserve their racial purity. Despite his normal contempt for ordinary people, he called the Newfoundland fishermen he met &quot;the best men that I have ever seen in the world&quot;. Gobineau observed that in these remote coastal settlements, there were no policemen as there was no crime, going on to write: 

==Ministerial career==

=== Minister to Persia ===
In 1861, Gobineau returned to Tehran as the French minister and lived a modest, ascetic lifestyle. He became obsessed with ancient Persia. This soon got out of control as he sought to prove ancient Persia was founded by his much admired Aryans, leading him to engage in what Irwin called &quot;deranged&quot; theories about Persia&#x27;s history. In 1865 Gobineau published &quot;Les religions et les philosophies dans l&#x27;Asie centrale&quot; (&quot;Religions and Philosophies in Central Asia&quot;), an account of his travels in Persia and encounters with the various esoteric Islamic sects he discovered being practiced in the Persian countryside. His mystical frame of mind led him to feel in Persia what he called &quot;un certain plaisir&quot; (&quot;a certain pleasure&quot;) as nowhere else in the world did he feel the same sort of joy he felt when viewing the ruins of Persia.

Gobineau had a low opinion of Islam, a religion invented by the Arab Mohammed. He viewed him as part of the &quot;Semitic race&quot;, unlike the Persians whose Indo-European language led him to see them as Aryans. Gobineau believed that Shia Islam was part of a &quot;revolt&quot; by the Aryan Persians against the Semitic Arabs, seeing a close connection between Shia Islam and Persian nationalism. Based on his own experiences, Gobineau believed the Persians did not really believe in Islam, with the faith of the Prophet being a cover over a society that still preserved many pre-Islamic features. Gobineau also described the savage persecution of the followers of Bábism and of the new religion of the Baháʼí Faith by the Persian state, which was determined to uphold Shia Islam as the state religion. Gobineau approved of the persecution of the Babi. He wrote they were &quot;veritable communists&quot; and &quot;true and pure supporters of socialism&quot;, as every bit as dangerous as the French socialists. He agreed the Peacock Throne was right to stamp out Bábism. Gobineau was one of the first Westerners to examine the esoteric sects of Persia. Though his work was idiosyncratic, he did spark scholarly interest in an aspect of Persia that had been ignored by Westerners until then. 

==== Criticism of Gobineau&#x27;s Persian work ====
Only with his studies in ancient Persia did Gobineau come under fire from scholars. He published two books on ancient Persia, &quot;Lectures des textes cunéiformes&quot; (1858) (&quot;Readings of Cuneiform Texts&quot;) and &quot;Traité des écritures cunéiformes&quot; (1864) (&quot;Treatise of Cuneiform Fragments&quot;). Irwin wrote: &quot;The first treatise is wrong-headed, yet still on this side of sanity; the second later and much longer work shows many signs of the kind of derangement that is likely to infect those who interest themselves too closely in the study of occultism.&quot; One of the principal problems with Gobineau&#x27;s approach to translating the cuneiform texts of ancient Persia was that he failed to understand linguistic change and that Old Persian was not the same language as modern Persian. His books met with hostile reception from scholars who argued that Gobineau simply did not understand the texts he was purporting to translate.

Gobineau&#x27;s article attempting to rebut his critics in the &quot;Journal asiatique&quot; was not published, as the editors considered his article &quot;unpublishable&quot; as it was full of &quot;absurd&quot; claims and vitriolic abuse of his critics. During his second time in Persia, Gobineau spent much time working as an amateur archeologist and gathering material for what was to become &quot;Traité des écritures cunéiformes&quot;, a book that Irwin called &quot;a monument to learned madness&quot;. Gobineau was always very proud of it, seeing the book as a &quot;magnum opus&quot; that rivaled the &quot;Essai&quot;. Gobineau had often traveled from Tehran to the Ottoman Empire to visit the ruins of Dur-Sharrukin at Khorsabad, near Mosul in what is now northern Iraq. The ruins of Khorsabad are Assyrian, built by King Sargon II in 717 BC, but Gobineau believed the ruins were actually Persian and built by Darius the Great some two hundred years later.

French archeologist Paul-Émile Botta published a scathing review of &quot;Traité des écritures cunéiformes&quot; in the &quot;Journal asiatique&quot;. He wrote the cuneiform texts at the Dur-Sharrukin were Akkadian, that Gobineau did not know what he was talking about, and the only reason he had even written the review was to prove that he had wasted his time reading the book. As Gobineau insistently pressed his thesis, the leading Orientalist in France, Julius von Mohl of the &quot;Société Asiatique&quot;, was forced to intervene in the dispute to argue that Gobineau&#x27;s theories lacked &quot;scientific rigor&quot; while he admired the &quot;artistry&quot; of Gobineau&#x27;s thesis.

Continuing his interest in Persia, Gobineau published &quot;Histoire des Perses&quot; (&quot;History of the Persians&quot;) in 1869. In it he did not attempt to distinguish between Persian history and legends treating the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and the &quot;Kush Nama&quot; (a 12th-century poem presenting a legendary story of two Chinese emperors) as factual, reliable accounts of Persia&#x27;s ancient history. As such, Gobineau began his history by presenting the Persians as Aryans who arrived in Persia from Central Asia and conquered the race of giants known to them as the &quot;Diws&quot;. Gobineau also added his own racial theories to the &quot;Histoire des Perses&quot;, explaining how Cyrus the Great had planned the migration of the Aryans into Europe making him responsible for the &quot;grandeur&quot; of medieval Europe. For Gobineau, Cyrus the Great was the greatest leader in history, writing: &quot;Whatever we ourselves are, as Frenchmen, Englishmen, Germans, Europeans of the nineteenth century, it is to Cyrus that we owe it&quot;, going on to call Cyrus as &quot;the greatest of the great men in all human history&quot;.

===Minister to Greece===

In 1864, Gobineau became the French minister to Greece. During his time in Athens, which with Tehran were the only cities he was stationed in that he liked, he spent his time writing poetry and learning about sculpture when not traveling with Ernest Renan in the Greek countryside in search of ruins. Gobineau seduced two sisters in Athens, Zoé and Marika Dragoumis, who became his mistresses; Zoé remained a lifelong correspondent. 

In 1832, although nominally independent, Greece had become a joint Anglo-French-Russian protectorate. As such the British, French and Russian ministers in Athens had the theoretical power to countermand any decision of the Greek cabinet. Gobineau repeatedly advised against France exercising this power, writing Greece was &quot;the sad and living evidence of European ineptness and presumptuousness&quot;. He attacked the British attempt to bring Westminster-style democracy to Greece as bringing about &quot;the complete decay of a barbarous land&quot; while accusing the French of being guilty of introducing the Greeks to &quot;the most inept Voltairianism&quot;. However, during his later years, the Greek economy began to grow rapidly; due to this, Gobineau &quot;became so impressed by the Greek economic and social development that he unwittingly acknowledged the benefits of the modern era&quot;. After that point, he showed sympathy for the contemporary Greek society building a modern state.

About the &quot;Eastern Question&quot;, Gobineau was initially in favor of Greek expansionism; he was a supporter of Ioannis Kolettis and his &quot;Megali Idea&quot;. However, later on, he advised against French support for the irredentist Greek aspirations, writing the Greeks could not replace the Ottoman Empire, and if the Ottoman Empire should be replaced with a greater Greece, only Russia would benefit. He no longer believed that a revived &quot;Greek empire&quot; could thwart Russian imperialism. He believed that the Ottoman Empire was more suitable to do so at the time. Gobineau advised Paris: &quot;The Greeks will not control the Orient, neither will the Armenians nor the Slav nor any Christian population, and, at the same time, if others were to come—even the Russians, the most oriental of them all—they could only submit to the harmful influences of this anarchic situation. [...] For me [...] there is no Eastern Question and if I had the honour of being a great government I should concern myself no longer with developments in these areas.&quot; In the spring of 1866, Christian Greeks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire on the island of Crete. Three emissaries arrived in Athens to ask Gobineau for French support for the uprising, saying it was well known that France was the champion of justice and the rights of &quot;small nations&quot;. As France was heavily engaged in the war in Mexico Gobineau, speaking for Napoleon III, informed the Cretans to expect no support from France—they were on their own in taking on the Ottoman Empire. He called the uprising &quot;the most perfect monument to lies, mischief and impudence that has been seen in thirty years&quot;. He had no sympathy with the Greek desire to liberate their compatriots living under Ottoman rule; writing to his friend Anton von Prokesch-Osten he noted: &quot;It is one rabble against another&quot;. In his elderly years, however, he returned to his original position, supporting Greek irredentist ideas.
==== Recall to France as a result of Cretan uprising ====
During the Cretan uprising, a young French academic Gustave Flourens, noted for his fiery enthusiasm for liberal causes, had joined the Cretean uprising and had gone to Athens to try to persuade the Greek government to support it. Gobineau had unwisely shown Flourens diplomatic dispatches from Paris showing both the French and Greek governments were unwilling to offend the Ottomans by supporting the Cretan uprising, which Flourens then leaked to the press. Gobineau received orders from Napoleon III to silence Flourens. On 28 May 1868, while Flourens was heading for a meeting with King George I, he was intercepted by Gobineau who had him arrested by the legation guards, put into chains and loaded onto the first French ship heading for Marseille. &quot;L&#x27;affaire Flourens&quot; became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in France with novelist Victor Hugo condemning Gobineau in an opinion piece in &quot;Le Tribute&quot; on 19 July 1868 for the treacherous way he had treated a fellow Frenchman fighting for Greek freedom. With French public opinion widely condemning the minister in Athens, Gobineau was recalled to Paris in disgrace.

==== Views on Greeks ====
His views about modern Greeks were paradoxical and ambiguous; he stated his ideas somewhat vaguely and confusedly, basing them only on general information. He wrote that the Greek people had generally lost a lot of the &quot;Aryan blood&quot; responsible for &quot;the glory that was Greece&quot; due to miscegenation. However, he did not deny the existence of the ancient Greek nucleus in modern Greeks. Instead, he believed that the Greek race had &quot;absorbed&quot; all of the foreign invaders. The result of this was a strong alloy, since the Greeks had integrated the best traits of the people they came into contact with. He concluded that the Greeks demonstrated all the requisite qualities to earn the accolade &quot;nationality&quot;. Gobineau, indeed, admired the modern Greeks, considering them the &quot;educators&quot; of the Balkan people.

==== Assessments ====
In 1868, Gobineau wrote that, without Greece, he would not have been able to do many of the things that he did (&quot;Sans la Grèce, je n&#x27;aurais pas fait beaucoup de choses que j&#x27;ai faites. La Grèce y est pour beaucoup&quot;). According to anthropologist Ivo T. Budil:
Gobineau&#x27;s legacy in Greece after his death was ambivalent. The Greek philologist and historian considered him a genuine philhellene whose words and actions were misunderstood.

=== Minister to Brazil ===
In 1869, Gobineau was appointed the French minister to Brazil. At the time, France and Brazil did not have diplomatic relations at an ambassadorial level, only legations headed by ministers. Gobineau was unhappy the Quai d&#x27;Orsay had sent him to Brazil, which he viewed as an insufficiently grand posting. Gobineau landed in Rio de Janeiro during the riotously sensual Carnival, which disgusted him. From that moment on he detested Brazil, which he saw as a culturally backward and unsanitary place of diseases. He feared falling victim to the yellow fever that decimated the population of Brazil on a regular basis. Gobineau&#x27;s major duties during his time in Brazil from March 1869 to April 1870 were to help mediate the end of the Paraguayan War and seek compensation after Brazilian troops looted the French legation in Asunción. He did so and was equally successful in negotiating an extradition treaty between the French Empire and the Empire of Brazil. He dropped hints to Emperor Pedro II that French public opinion favored the emancipation of Brazil&#x27;s slaves. As slavery was the basis of Brazil&#x27;s economy, and Brazil had the largest slave population in the Americas, Pedro II was unwilling to abolish slavery at this time.

As most Brazilians have a mixture of Portuguese, African and Indian ancestry, Gobineau saw the Brazilian people, whom he loathed, as confirming his theories about the perils of miscegenation. He wrote to Paris that Brazilians were &quot;a population totally mixed, vitiated in its blood and spirit, fearfully ugly ... Not a single Brazilian has pure blood because of the pattern of marriages among whites, Indians and Negroes is so widespread that the nuances of color are infinite, causing a degeneration among the lower as well the upper classes&quot;. He noted Brazilians are &quot;neither hard-working, active nor fertile&quot;. Based on all this, Gobineau reached the conclusion that all human life would cease in Brazil within the next 200 years on the grounds of &quot;genetic degeneracy&quot;.

Gobineau was unpopular in Brazil. His letters to Paris show his complete contempt for everybody in Brazil, regardless of their nationality (except for the Emperor Pedro II), with his most damning words reserved for Brazilians. He wrote about Brazil: &quot;Everyone is ugly here, unbelievably ugly, like apes&quot;. His only friend during his time in Rio was Emperor Pedro II, whom Gobineau praised as a wise and great leader, noting his blue eyes and blond hair as proof that Pedro was an Aryan. The fact Pedro was of the House of Braganza left Gobineau assured he had no African or Indian blood. Gobineau wrote: &quot;Except for the Emperor there is no one in this desert full of thieves&quot; who was worthy of his friendship.

Gobineau&#x27;s attitudes of contempt for the Brazilian people led him to spend much of his time feuding with the Brazilian elite. In 1870 he was involved in a bloody street brawl with the son-in-law of a Brazilian senator who did not appreciate having his nation being put down. As a result of the brawl, Pedro II asked Paris to have his friend recalled, or he would declare him &quot;persona non-grata&quot;. Rather than suffer the humiliation of this happening to the French minister the Quai d&#x27;Orsay promptly recalled Gobineau.

===Return to France===

In May 1870 Gobineau returned to France from Brazil. In a letter to Tocqueville in 1859 he wrote, &quot;When we come to the French people, I genuinely favor absolute power&quot;, and as long as Napoleon III ruled as an autocrat, he had Gobineau&#x27;s support. Gobineau had often predicted France was so rotten the French were bound to be defeated if they ever fought a major war. At the outbreak of the war with Prussia in July 1870, however, he believed they would win within a few weeks. After the German victory, Gobineau triumphantly used his own country&#x27;s defeat as proof of his racial theories. He spent the war as the &quot;maire&quot; (mayor) of the little town of Trie in Oise department. After the Prussians occupied Trie, Gobineau established good relations with them and was able to reduce the indemnity imposed on Oise department.

Later, Gobineau wrote a book &quot;Ce qui est arrivé à la France en 1870&quot; (&quot;What Happened to France in 1870&quot;) explaining the French defeat was due to racial degeneration, which no publisher chose to publish. He argued the French bourgeoisie were &quot;descended from Gallo-Roman slaves&quot;, which explained why they were no match for an army commanded by &quot;Junkers&quot;. Gobineau attacked Napoleon III for his plans to rebuild Paris writing: &quot;This city, pompously described as the capital of the universe, is in reality only the vast caravanserai for the idleness, greed and carousing of all Europe.&quot;

In 1871, poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt who met Gobineau described him thus: Despite his embittered view of the world and misanthropic attitudes, Gobineau was capable of displaying much charm when he wanted to. He was described by historian Albert Sorel as &quot;a man of grace and charm&quot; who would have made a perfect diplomat in &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; France.

===Minister to Sweden===
In May 1872, Gobineau was appointed the French minister to Sweden. After arriving in Stockholm, he wrote to his sister Caroline: &quot;This is the pure race of the North—that of the masters&quot;, calling the Swedes &quot;the purest branch of the Germanic race&quot;. In contrast to France, Gobineau was impressed with the lack of social conflict in Sweden, writing to Dragoumis: &quot;There is no class hatred. The nobility lives on friendly terms with the middle class and with the people at large&quot;. Gobineau argued that because of Sweden&#x27;s remote location in Scandinavia, Aryan blood had been better preserved as compared to France. Writing about the accession of Oscar II to the Swedish throne in 1872 he said: &quot;This country is unique ... I have just seen one king die and another ascend the throne without anyone doubling the guard or alerting a soldier&quot;. The essential conservatism of Swedish society also impressed Gobineau as he wrote to Pedro II: &quot;The conservative feeling is amongst the most powerful in the national spirit and these people relinquish the past only step by step and with extreme caution&quot;.

Sweden presented a problem for Gobineau between reconciling his belief in an Aryan master race with his insistence that only the upper classes were Aryans. He eventually resolved this by denouncing the Swedes as debased Aryans after all. He used the fact King Oscar allowed Swedish democracy to exist and did not try to rule as an absolute monarch as evidence the House of Bernadotte were all weak and cowardly kings. By 1875, Gobineau was writing, &quot;Sweden horrifies me&quot; and wrote with disgust about &quot;Swedish vulgarity and contemptibility&quot;.

In 1874, Gobineau met the homosexual German diplomat Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, in Stockholm and became very close to him. Eulenburg was later to recall fondly how he and Gobineau had spent hours during their time in Sweden under the &quot;Nordic sky, where the old world of the gods lived on in the customs and habits of the people as well in their hearts.&quot; Gobineau later wrote that only two people in the entire world had ever properly understood his racist philosophy, namely Richard Wagner and Eulenburg.
Gobineau encouraged Eulenburg to promote his theory of an Aryan master-race, telling him: &quot;In this way you will help many people understand things sooner.&quot; Later, Eulenburg was to complain all of his letters to Gobineau had to be destroyed because &quot;They contain too much of an intimately personal nature&quot;. During his time in Sweden, Gobineau became obsessed with the Vikings and became intent on proving he was descended from the Norse. His time in Stockholm was a very productive period from a literary viewpoint. He wrote &quot;Les Pléiades&quot; (&quot;The Pleiades&quot;), &quot;Les Nouvelles Asiatiques&quot; (&quot;The New Asians&quot;), &quot;La Renaissance&quot;, most of &quot;Histoire de Ottar Jarl, pirate norvégien conquérant du pays de Bray en Normandie et de sa descendance&quot; (&quot;History of Ottar Jarl, Norwegian Pirate and Conqueror of Normandy and his Descendants&quot;) and completed the first half of his epic poem &quot;Amadis&quot; while serving as minister to Sweden. &quot;Amadis&quot; is a 12,000 verse epic poem published posthumously in 1887 which concludes with its protagonists drowning in the blood of the Chinese they have killed.

In 1879, Gobineau attempted to prove his own racial superiority over the rest of the French with his pseudo-family history &quot;Histoire de Ottar Jarl&quot;. It begins with the line &quot;I descend from Odin&quot;, and traces his supposed descent from the Viking Ottar Jarl. As the de Gobineau family first appeared in history in late 15th century Bordeaux, and Ottar Jarl—who may or may not have been a real person—is said to have lived in the 10th century, Gobineau had to resort to a great deal of invention to make his genealogy work. For him, the &quot;Essai&quot;, the &quot;Histoire des Perses&quot; and &quot;Histoire de Ottar Jarl&quot; comprised a trilogy, what the French critic Jean Caulmier called &quot;a poetic vision of the human adventure&quot;, covering the universal history of all races in the &quot;Essai&quot;, to the history of the Aryan branch in Persia in &quot;Histoire des Perses&quot; to his own family&#x27;s history in &quot;Histoire de Ottar Jarl&quot;.

During his time in Sweden, although remaining outwardly faithful to the Catholic Church, Gobineau privately abandoned his belief in Christianity. He was very interested in the pagan religion of the Vikings, which seemed more authentically Aryan to him. For him, maintaining his Catholicism was a symbol of his reactionary politics and rejection of liberalism, and it was for these reasons he continued to nominally observe Catholicism. Gobineau told his friend the Comte de Basterot that he wanted a Catholic burial only because the de Gobineaus had always been buried in Catholic ceremonies, not because of any belief in Catholicism.

For leaving his post in Stockholm without permission to join the Emperor Pedro II on his European visit, Gobineau was told in January 1877 to either resign from the Quai d&#x27;Orsay or be fired; he chose the former.

Gobineau spent his last years living in Rome, a lonely and embittered man whose principal friends were the Wagners and Eulenburg. He saw himself as a great sculptor and attempted to support himself by selling his sculpture.

==Legacy and influence==

Gobineau&#x27;s ideas were influential in a number of countries, especially Romania, Ottoman Empire, Germany, and Brazil, both during his lifetime and after his death.

<text>Ian David Hislop (born 13 July 1960) is a British journalist, satirist, and television personality. He is the editor of the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, a position he has held since 1986. He has appeared on many radio and television programmes and has been a team captain on the BBC satirical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; since its inception in 1990. Hislop has frequently been involved in legal battles, as &quot;Private Eye&quot; has often been sued for libel over the years. Despite these challenges, Hislop has remained a key figure in British satire and journalism.

== Early life ==

Hislop was born on 13 July 1960 in Mumbles, Swansea, to a Scottish father, David Hislop, from Ayrshire, and a Channel Islander mother born in Jersey, Helen Rosemarie Hislop (née Beddows), who left for Wales in her late teens.

Hislop did not know his grandparents. His paternal grandfather, David Murdoch Hislop, died just before he was born. His maternal grandfather, William Beddows, was originally from Lancashire.

When he was five months old, Hislop&#x27;s family began to travel around the world because of his father&#x27;s job as a civil engineer. During his infant years, Hislop lived in Nigeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Hong Kong. Hislop has said he possibly went to school with Osama bin Laden while in Saudi Arabia. When Hislop was 12 years old his father died; his mother died when he was 32. On his return to Britain he was educated at Ardingly College, an independent boarding school, where he became head boy, and began his satirical career directing and appearing in revues alongside Nick Newman.

Hislop&#x27;s and Newman&#x27;s association continued when they attended Oxford University together; later they worked together at &quot;Private Eye&quot; and on comedy scriptwriting jobs. Hislop applied to read philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, but changed to English literature before arriving at Magdalen College. His Oxford tutors included Bernard O&#x27;Donoghue, John Fuller and David Norbrook. While at university, Hislop was actively involved in student journalism; he relaunched and edited the satirical magazine &quot;Passing Wind&quot;. He graduated with a 2:1 in 1981.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Private Eye&quot; ===

At Oxford, Hislop revived and edited the magazine &quot;Passing Wind&quot;, for which he interviewed Richard Ingrams, who was then editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and Peter Cook, then the majority shareholder. Hislop&#x27;s first article in the &quot;Eye&quot; appeared in 1980 before he sat his university finals. A parody of &quot;The Observer&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Room of My Own&quot; feature, it described an IRA prisoner on the dirty protest decorating his cell in &quot;fetching brown&quot;. Hislop joined the publication immediately after leaving Oxford, and became editor in 1986 following Ingrams&#x27;s departure. This met opposition from &quot;Eye&quot; journalists Peter McKay and Nigel Dempster, who attempted a revolt against Hislop with the former taking Peter Cook out for lunch in an attempt to dissuade him from appointing Hislop. Cook, reportedly drunk after the lunch, instead announced Hislop was &quot;welcome aboard&quot;. The new editor, dismissive of society gossip, sacked both McKay and Dempster from the magazine without hesitation.

As editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, Ian Hislop is reputedly the most sued man in English legal history, although he is not involved in as many libel actions as he once was. A libel case was brought against &quot;Private Eye&quot; and Hislop in 1986 by the publisher Robert Maxwell after the magazine accused him of funding Labour leader Neil Kinnock&#x27;s travel expenses as a means of gaining a peerage. After the case Hislop quipped: &quot;I&#x27;ve just given a fat cheque to a fat Czech&quot;. After his death in 1991, Maxwell was revealed to be an extensive fraudster, illegally drawing on his companies&#x27; pension funds; his last writ for libel against the &quot;Eye&quot; and Hislop was about this &quot;malicious&quot; and &quot;mendacious&quot; claim.

Another libel case in May 1989 threatened the magazine&#x27;s existence when it was ordered to pay £600,000 in damages following an action for libel by Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. Hislop told reporters waiting outside the High Court: &quot;If that&#x27;s justice, then I&#x27;m a banana.&quot; The award was dropped to £60,000 on appeal. In an interview with &quot;Third Way Magazine&quot; in 1995 he explained his intentions in his work: &quot;Satire is the bringing to ridicule of vice, folly and humbug. All the negatives imply a set of positives. Certainly in this country, you only go round saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s wrong, that&#x27;s corrupt&#x27; if you have some feeling that it should be better than that. People say, &#x27;You satirists attack everything.&#x27; Well, we don&#x27;t, actually. That&#x27;s the whole point.&quot;

In April 2017, Hislop won the London Press Club&#x27;s print journalist of the year award; in his acceptance speech he said that &quot;Private Eye&quot; obtaining its best ABC sales figures since the magazine&#x27;s launch 55 years earlier proved that &quot;journalism is A, worth doing, and B, worth paying for both in terms of paying journalists and the public paying up for it&quot;.
In January 2022, Hislop alongside fellow &quot;Eye&quot; journalists Richard Brooks and Solomon Hughes presented evidence on MPs&#x27; conduct to the House of Commons&#x27; Standards Committee.

=== Television and radio work ===
Hislop&#x27;s television debut was on the short-lived Channel 4 chat show &quot;Loose Talk&quot; in 1983, an experience he disliked so much that he included it on his list of most hated items when he first appeared on the BBC show &quot;Room 101&quot;. Hislop, usually in partnership with Nick Newman, was a scriptwriter on the 1980s political satire series &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, in which puppets were used to depict well-known figures, mostly politicians. He even had a puppet of himself, which sometimes appeared as a background character in sketches.

Hislop has been a team captain on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, against the team led by Paul Merton, since it began in 1990. He is the only person to have appeared in every episode of its run, even filming an episode in the seventh series in spite of suffering from appendicitis, when he had discharged himself from hospital immediately before the show.

With regular writing partner Nick Newman, Hislop wrote the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Gush&quot;, a satire based on the first Gulf War, in the style of Jeffrey Archer. With Newman he also wrote the family-friendly satirical sitcom &quot;My Dad&#x27;s the Prime Minister&quot; and in the early nineties for the Dawn French vehicle &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;. Hislop and Newman wrote the Radio 4 series &quot;The News at Bedtime&quot;, a satire on fairy tales which aired over the 2009 Christmas season. The series starred Jack Dee as John Tweedledum and Peter Capaldi as Jim Tweedledee; the two present the &quot;news of the day&quot; in the world of fairy tales, while arguing with each other as did their namesakes.

Hislop has presented serious television programmes. These include &quot;School Rules&quot;, a three-part Channel 4 study on the history of British education; an edition of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, in which he attempted to trace his ancestry, and &quot;Not Forgotten&quot;, a four-part series on Channel 4 detailing the impact on British society of the First World War. A further programme, &quot;Not Forgotten: Shot at Dawn&quot;, was broadcast in January 2007, and a sixth episode, &quot;Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn&#x27;t Fight&quot;, featuring the stories of conscientious objectors such as Ronald Skirth, was aired on 10 November 2008. He also presented one episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Great Railway Journeys&quot;, in which he travelled in India (&quot;India East to West&quot; from Calcutta to Rajasthan). In May 2007 he presented a programme on BBC Four, &quot;Ian Hislop&#x27;s Scouting for Boys&quot;, celebrating Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s book which inspired the Scout movement (he is also an Ambassador for The Scout Association).
He has also written and presented factual programmes for Radio 4 about such subjects as tax rebellions, female hymn composers, scouting and patron saints of Britain and Ireland. In 2007 he became the only person to make a second guest appearance on &quot;Room 101&quot;. He has also been a screenwriter for comedian Harry Enfield.

Hislop has presented several programmes for BBC Four, dealing with topics such as the Beeching Axe and the role of the Poet Laureate. The former, &quot;Ian Hislop Goes off the Rails&quot;, about the Beeching Report and its impact on the British railway network, was first aired on 2 October 2008, and achieved the second-highest audience to date for any BBC Four programme (and the highest for a documentary) with 1.3 million viewers. The latter, &quot;Ian Hislop&#x27;s Changing of the Bard&quot;, launched the May 2009 BBC Four Poetry season, and Hislop recounted the history of the post from the first official holder, John Dryden, to the then recently announced first female, first Scot and first openly bisexual laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. His series on Victorian social reformers, &quot;Ian Hislop&#x27;s Age of the Do-Gooders&quot;, aired on BBC Two beginning on 29 November 2010. His programme on the history of banks, &quot;When Bankers were Good&quot;, first aired on BBC Two in November 2011, and dealt with famous bankers from history, such as the Rothschilds, the Gurneys and the Lloyds, as well as 19th-century philanthropists and reformers such as Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Fry.

He has also appeared on &quot;Question Time&quot;. In one edition he made an open attack on Jeffrey Archer, who had been imprisoned for perjury, when his wife, Mary Archer, was a fellow panellist. She was noticeably angry that the matter had been raised. In 2004, &quot;Question Time&quot;&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations included a vote in which viewers chose the confrontation as the best moment in the programme&#x27;s history; it won 51% of the votes, double the number for the second-placed entry. In another episode he criticised the premise of capital punishment, something which had been advocated by Conservative panel member Priti Patel, and more recently has discussed Britain&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union. In 2003 he was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

&quot;Ian Hislop&#x27;s Stiff Upper Lip - An Emotional History of Britain&quot;, about how a meme for repression of emotions spread through British culture, began on 2 October 2012 and ran for three episodes on BBC Two. Beginning on 9 April 2014, Hislop presented a three-part BBC Two series &quot;Ian Hislop&#x27;s Olden Days&quot;. In 2016, he presented &quot;The Secret of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony&quot;, the personal and creative story behind the symphony. Later in the same year, Hislop gave the prestigious George Orwell Lecture at London&#x27;s UCL. The following year, he fronted the BBC Two documentary &quot;Who Should We Let In? Ian Hislop on the First Great Immigration Row&quot;. The programme examined attitudes to immigration from the Victorian era to the First World War.

Hislop has also curated an exhibition for the British Museum, called &quot;I Object: Ian Hislop&#x27;s Search for Dissent,&quot; which was presented from 6 September 2018 to 20 January 2019. As the editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, Hislop has received an award for Outstanding Contribution to British Media at the &quot;Campaign&quot; British Media Awards 2019. Hislop has also been recognised for his broadcasting career, having produced TV and radio documentaries on immigration and the First World War.

== Personal life ==
Hislop married author Victoria Hamson in 1988; they have two children, Emily and Will. They live in Sissinghurst in Kent. In 2010, Hislop played a small role in the Greek television series &quot;The Island&quot;, which was based on his wife&#x27;s bestselling novel. The series premiered on 11 October 2010 on Greece&#x27;s Mega television channel.

His son, Will Hislop, is an actor, writer and stand-up comedian.

=== Religious views ===
In Caroline Chartres&#x27;s book &quot;Why I Am Still an Anglican&quot;, Hislop opens his chapter by saying &quot;I&#x27;ve tried atheism and I can&#x27;t stick at it: I keep having doubts. That probably sums up my position.&quot; In 1996, Hislop presented an award-winning documentary series for Channel 4 about the history of the Church of England, called &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. His other works include the four-part BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Real Patron Saints&quot;.

On 4 September 2009, Hislop appeared at &quot;The Gathering&quot;, organised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, at Canterbury Cathedral to discuss religion, society and journalism, among other issues, in front of an audience of about 1,000.

=== Political views ===
Hislop has mocked all major British political parties during his career. Appearing on &quot;Question Time&quot; on 18 September 2008, he praised Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable for his analysis of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and expressed support for the Liberal Democrats, jocularly stating &quot;I&#x27;m standing for them&quot;.

In a 2009 &quot;Five minutes with&quot; interview with Matthew Stadlen for BBC News, Hislop stated that if he were required, &quot;at the point of a gun&quot;, to stand in an election for any British political party, he would stand for the fictional &quot;Vince Cable for Treasurer Party&quot;. After the formation of the coalition government in 2010, Hislop remarked in an interview, &quot;I like the idea of this coalition neutralising the loonies on both sides&quot;.

He has also been highly critical of the leadership of the European Union, calling for a referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in a 2003 recording of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. However, referring to Britain&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union, Hislop said on &quot;Question Time&quot; that &quot;after an election or a referendum, even if you lose the vote, you are entitled to go on making the argument&quot;. A joke on the front of &quot;Private Eye&quot; titled &quot;BREXIT LATEST&quot; mocking the reaction to Brexit received &quot;fifty or so&quot; letters of complaint in the next issue. Hislop mocked this, saying that &quot;There was one [letter] from a vicar, too, who told me that it was time to accept the victory of the majority of the people and to stop complaining. ... I wrote back and told him that this argument was a bit much, coming from a church that had begun with a minority of 12.&quot; He has expressed dismay over the level of public debate in the aftermath of Britain&#x27;s vote to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump, describing it as Orwellian in nature, saying that &quot;one is unsure whether to feel relieved at the sense of &quot;déjà vu&quot; or worried about the possibility of history repeating itself, not as farce, but as tragedy again&quot;.

==Floral tribute==
A variety of dahlia, first bred in 2010, is named &quot;Ian Hislop&quot; after him.

<text>Uther Pendragon (Brittonic) (; ), also known as King Uther, was a legendary King of the Britons and father of King Arthur.

A few minor references to Uther appear in Old Welsh poems, but his biography was first written down in the 12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), and Geoffrey&#x27;s account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of his people.

According to Arthurian legend, Merlin magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy Gorlois, enabling Uther to rape Gorlois&#x27; wife Lady Igraine. Thus Arthur, &quot;the once and future king&quot;, is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in Malory, emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois&#x27;s death and that he was legitimated by Uther&#x27;s subsequent marriage to Igraine). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther&#x27;s troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur&#x27;s siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the 13th century French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds King Arthur in the Battle of Camlann.

==Epithet==
Uther&#x27;s epithet &quot;Pendragon&quot; literally means &quot;head dragon&quot; in its original Brittonic, though it was used figuratively to mean &quot;highest commander; head leader; top of the command chain.&quot; Geoffrey of Monmouth in &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; misinterpreted it as &quot;the head of a dragon&quot; and invented an origin to explain it away: Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous dragon-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his standards. According to Robert de Boron and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther&#x27;s older brother (elsewhere called Aurelius Ambrosius and likely based on Ambrosius Aurelianus) who saw the comet and received the name &quot;Pendragon&quot;, Uther taking his epithet after his death. An alternative possibility is it stems from adopting the use of the draco military standard of the Roman cavalry, but this is likely a historical conjecture.

The title &quot;Pendragon&quot; was borrowed into Middle English from Welsh, where it originally indicated a literal dragon of great power or size but was eventually used figuratively to mean &quot;a great leader; the highest commander&quot;. It is composed of the Old Welsh prefix &quot;pen-&quot; &quot;a tall hill; headlands; great heights&quot;, which is still used for place names in Wales and Cornwall (as in the famous Cornish town &quot;Penzance&quot;, or &quot;holy headland&quot;) combined with the Old English &quot;dragoun&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; which was borrowed from the Old French &quot;dragon&quot; (originally the Latin accusative noun &quot;draconem&quot; &quot;a massive serpent or sea creature&quot;, which was itself based on ancient Greek mythological dragons).

==Early Welsh poetry==
Though the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the Welsh Triads and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.

He is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem &quot;Pa gur yv y porthaur?&quot; (&quot;What man is the gatekeeper?&quot;), where it is only said of him that Mabon son of Modron is his servant. He is also memorialised with &quot;The Death-song of Uther Pen&quot; from the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;. The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of &quot;dragon&quot; to Uther&#x27;s name is probably justified. &quot;The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle&quot;, a modern manuscript from the 16th century but believed to have originated from the 13th century, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur&#x27;s nephew Eliwlod.

In Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard Menw. Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with Merlin&#x27;s help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.

Uthyr&#x27;s other reference, Triad 51, shows influence from Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;. It follows Geoffrey&#x27;s description of Uther as brother of both Aurelius Ambrosius (&quot;Emrys Wledig&quot;) and Constans II (&quot;Custennin the Younger&quot;). However, its account of Uther&#x27;s parentage differs; Triad 51 describes Uther&#x27;s father to be Constantine III (&quot;Custennin the Blessed&quot;) son of Elen, while Monmouth describes Uther&#x27;s father to be Constantine, brother of King Aldroen of Armorica.

==&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;==
Uther is best known from Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father&#x27;s death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser Vortigern, who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, Aurelius Ambrosius, still children, flee to Brittany. Vortigern makes an alliance with the Saxons under Hengist, but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.

With Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to Ireland to help Merlin bring the stones of Stonehenge from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern&#x27;s son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius&#x27;s death and Uther&#x27;s glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet &quot;Pendragon&quot;, and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard.

He secures Britain&#x27;s frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois&#x27; wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of Tintagel for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called Morgause and is usually Igerna&#x27;s daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries King Lot and becomes the mother of Gawain and Mordred.

Uther later falls ill and the wars against the Saxons begin to go badly. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist&#x27;s son Octa at Verulamium (St Albans), despite the Saxons calling him the &quot;Half-Dead King&quot;. However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.

Uther&#x27;s family is based on some historical figures; Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by Gildas, though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded. It is possible that Uther himself is based at least partially on Tewdrig, a historical king of Glywysing in the sixth century, given the strong similarities between their death stories. Depending on the source, Uther may either be the son of Constantine III, as is related in the Welsh Triad 51, or he may be the son of Constantine of Dumnonia, as related in Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;.

==Other medieval literature==
In Robert de Boron&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;, Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the Round Table for him. In the &quot;Prose Lancelot&quot;, Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in Bourges. He takes an army to Brittany to fight against King Claudas at Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler Riothamus who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges. Uther also appears in the chivalric romance &quot;Sir Cleges&quot; as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.

There is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon&#x27;s background in Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;. A certain Mazadân went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurgân. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazadân&#x27;s alliance with the Fay Morgan in Terre de la Joye; the &quot;Land of Joy&quot;.) Mazadân becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandragûn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of Anjou, father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival (Percival). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of Anjou. Early German literature&#x27;s motif of Uther&#x27;s descent from fairies, believed to have relied on some now lost Celtic material, may have been meant to explain Arthur&#x27;s connection with Avalon. Since, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Caliburn was a gift from Avalon, and Arthur was taken to Avalon to be healed. Layamon in his &quot;Brut&quot; also said that Arthur was given various blessings by fairies.

Richard Carew&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602) drew on an earlier French writer, Nicholas Gille, who mentions Moigne, brother of Uther and Aurelius, who was duke of Cornwall, and &quot;governor of the Realme&quot; under Emperor Honorius. Carew&#x27;s brief account of Arthur&#x27;s birth also mentions a sister, Amy, also born to Uther and Igraine.

==Modern works==
Uther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern Arthurian literature and other fiction.

*In T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, Uther the Conqueror is the Norman King of England.
*Mary Stewart&#x27;s first two books in her Arthurian saga, &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; and &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot;, feature Uther Pendragon as Merlin&#x27;s uncle, Merlin being his brother Ambrosius&#x27; illegitimate son. Uther is depicted as a mostly decent but rather oversexed character, who becomes impotent in later life because of a groin injury, a Fisher King figure. 
*In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, Uther is the King of Dumnonia as well as the High King of Britain. In these novels, Arthur is his illegitimate son and Morgan is his illegitimate daughter. At the start of the trilogy&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Winter King&quot;, Uther is old and in failing health. His son Mordred has been killed during a battle with the Saxons, leaving behind a pregnant wife. Uther blames Arthur, who was at the battle, for his son&#x27;s death and banishes him to Armorica. His daughter-in-law, Princess Norwenna, gives birth to a son, whom Uther names Mordred after his father, and who he proclaims his heir. However, the decision is controversial as the child will not come of age before Uther&#x27;s death and has a clubfoot, a bad omen for the superstitious British. Uther dismisses these concerns and proclaims that Mordred will succeed him, enlisting the support of the other kings of Britain to ensure it. However, in response to his allies&#x27; concerns and his own people&#x27;s demand, he reluctantly appoints Arthur to be Mordred&#x27;s guardian until he comes of age. Uther dies soon after and, although he only appears at the start of the first novel, his final decision is the catalyst for most of the conflicts of the trilogy.
*In Jack Whyte&#x27;s &quot;The Camulod Chronicles&quot;, Uther is King of the Pendragon, the Celtic people of South Cambria, cousin to Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Ambrose Ambrosianus Britannicus. Whyte&#x27;s novel &quot;Uther&quot;, written in 2000, revolves around a fictionalised version of Uther&#x27;s life.
*In contrast to traditional versions, Stephen R. Lawhead&#x27;s &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; makes Uther&#x27;s brother Aurelius, whose widow (Ygerna) he marries, Arthur&#x27;s true father.
*In Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot;, Uther is the nephew of Aurelianus instead of his brother; while Aurelianus is the son of a Roman Emperor, Uther has no Roman blood. 
*In Valerio Massimo Manfredi&#x27;s &quot;The Last Legion&quot;, Uther is himself the last Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustus. While the real Romulus Augustus disappeared from history after being deposed by Goths, in the novel he escapes to Britain, where he adopts the name Pendragon and eventually sires Arthur.
*In D. J. MacHale&#x27;s &quot;Pendragon&quot; series, the main character, Bobby Pendragon, is the reincarnation of either Uther or his son Arthur.
*In John Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;Excalibur&quot;, Gabriel Byrne plays an ambitious but somewhat obtuse Uther Pendragon, whose uncontrollable lust for Igrayne, while necessary for the birth of Arthur, proves also his own undoing.
*In the BBC television series &quot;Merlin&quot;, Uther, played by Anthony Head, has banned magic in Camelot and slaughtered any who openly practise the art. It is revealed his wife Ygraine was unable to conceive, so Nimueh, a sorceress and friend, helped in the conception of Arthur. However, to keep balance in the world, a life had to be taken in exchange. Thus, Ygraine died at Arthur&#x27;s birth, and Uther&#x27;s guilt spurred him to purge all magic from Camelot. His wanton cruelty eventually causes his ward Morgana, who possesses magic herself, to turn against him. She is later revealed as his illegitimate daughter, and covets control of Camelot from then on. In series 4, Uther is wounded during an assassination attempt on Arthur. Merlin tries to heal him but due to Morgana&#x27;s meddling, the spell instead kills him.
*In the television series &quot;Camelot&quot;, Uther is poisoned by his daughter Morgana in the first episode.
*In Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;, Eric Bana plays Uther Pendragon, betrayed and murdered by his brother Vortigern for control over Camelot.
*Sebastian Armesto plays Uther Pendragon in the 2020 Internet TV series &quot;Cursed&quot;.

<text>African trypanosomiasis is an insect-borne parasitic infection of humans and other animals.

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as African sleeping sickness or simply sleeping sickness, is caused by the species &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;. Humans are infected by two types, &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; (TbG) and &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot; (TbR). TbG causes over 92% of reported cases. Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas.
Initially, the first stage of the disease is characterized by fevers, headaches, itchiness, and joint pains, beginning one to three weeks after the bite. Weeks to months later, the second stage begins with confusion, poor coordination, numbness, and trouble sleeping. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in a blood smear or in the fluid of a lymph node. A lumbar puncture is often needed to tell the difference between first- and second-stage disease. If the disease is not treated quickly, it can lead to death.
Prevention of severe disease involves screening the at-risk population with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage has been with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage has involved eflornithine or a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. Fexinidazole is a more recent treatment that can be taken by mouth, for either stage of TbG. While melarsoprol works for both types, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment, sleeping sickness typically results in death.
The disease occurs regularly in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa with the population at risk being about 70 million in 36 countries. An estimated 11,000 people are currently infected with 2,800 new infections in 2015. In 2018 there were 977 new cases. In 2015 it caused around 3,500 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990. More than 80% of these cases are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Three major outbreaks have occurred in recent history: one from 1896 to 1906 primarily in Uganda and the Congo Basin, and two in 1920 and 1970, in several African countries. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Other animals, such as cows, may carry the disease and become infected in which case it is known as nagana or animal trypanosomiasis.

==Signs and symptoms==
African trypanosomiasis symptoms occur in two stages: the hemolymphatic stage and the neurological stage (the latter being characterised by parasitic invasion of the central nervous system). Neurological symptoms occur in addition to the initial features, and the two stages may be difficult to distinguish based on clinical features alone.

The disease has been reported to present with atypical symptoms in infected individuals who originate from non-endemic areas (e.g. travelers). The reasons for this are unclear and may be genetic. The low number of such cases may also have skewed findings. In such persons, the infection is said to present mainly as fever with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea and jaundice) with lymphadenopathy developing only rarely.

=== Trypanosomal ulcer ===

Systemic disease is sometimes presaged by a trypanosomal ulcer developing at the site of the infectious fly bite within 2 days of infection. The ulcer is most commonly observed in &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot; infection, and only rarely in &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; (however, in &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; infection, ulcers are more common in persons from non-endemic areas).

=== Hemolymphatic phase ===
The incubation period is 1–3 weeks for &quot;T. b. rhodesiense,&quot; and longer (but less precisely characterised) in &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; infection. The first/initial stage, known as the hemolymphatic phase, is characterized by non-specific, generalised symptoms like: fever (intermittent), headaches (severe), joint pains, itching, weakness, malaise, fatigue, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Diagnosis may be delayed due to the vagueness of initial symptoms. The disease may also be mistaken for malaria (which may occur as a co-infection).

==== Intermittent fever ====

Fever is intermittent, with attacks lasting from a day to a week, separated by intervals of a few days to a month or longer. Episodes of fever become less frequent throughout the disease.

==== Lymphadenopathy ====

Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic systems by the parasite is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. Posterior cervical lymph nodes are most commonly affected, however, axillary, inguinal, and epitrochlear lymph node involvement may also occur. Winterbottom&#x27;s sign, the tell-tale swollen lymph nodes along the back of the neck, may appear. Winterbottom&#x27;s sign is common in &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; infection.

==== Other features ====

Those affected may additionally present with: skin rash, haemolytic anaemia, hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function, splenomegaly, endocrine disturbance, cardiac involvement (e.g. pericarditis, and congestive heart failure), and ophthalmic involvement.

=== Neurological phase ===
The second phase of the disease, the neurological phase (also called the &quot;meningoencephalic stage&quot;), begins when the parasite invades the central nervous system by passing through the blood–brain barrier. Progression to the neurological phase occurs after an estimated 21–60 days in case of &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot; infection, and 300–500 days in case of &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; infection.

In actuality, the two phases overlap and are difficult to distinguish based on clinical features alone; determining the actual stage of the disease is achieved by examining the cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of the parasite.

====Sleep disorders====

Sleep-wake disturbances are a leading feature of the neurological stage and give the disease its common name of &quot;sleeping sickness&quot;. Infected individuals experience a disorganized and fragmented sleep-wake cycle. Those affected experience sleep inversion resulting in daytime sleep and somnolence, and nighttime periods of wakefulness and insomnia. Additionally, those affected also experience episodes of sudden sleepiness.

====Neurological/neurocognitive symptoms====

Neurological symptoms include: tremor, general muscle weakness, hemiparesis, paralysis of a limb, abnormal muscle tone, gait disturbance, ataxia, speech disturbances, paraesthesia, hyperaesthesia, anaesthesia, visual disturbance, abnormal reflexes, seizures, and coma. Parkinson-like movements might arise due to non-specific movement disorders and speech disorders.

====Psychiatric/behavioural symptoms====

Individuals may exhibit psychiatric symptoms which may sometimes dominate the clinical diagnosis and may include aggressiveness, apathy, irritability, psychotic reactions and hallucinations, anxiety, emotional lability, confusion, mania, attention deficit, and delirium.

=== Advanced/late disease and outcomes ===
Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal, with progressive mental deterioration leading to coma, systemic organ failure, and death. An untreated infection with &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot; will cause death within months whereas an untreated infection with &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; will cause death after several years. Damage caused in the neurological phase is irreversible.

==Cause==

&quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; accounts for the majority of African trypanosomiasis cases, with humans as the main reservoir needed for the transmission, while &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot; is mainly zoonotic, with accidental human infections. The epidemiology of African trypanosomiasis is dependent on the interactions between the parasite (trypanosome), the vector (tsetse fly), and the host.

===&quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;===
There are two subspecies of the parasite that are responsible for starting the disease in humans. &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; causes the diseases in west and central Africa, whereas &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot; has a limited geographical range and is responsible for causing the disease in east and southern Africa. In addition, a third subspecies of the parasite known as &quot;Trypanosoma brucei brucei&quot; is responsible for affecting animals but not humans.

Humans are the main reservoir for &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; but this species can also be found in pigs and other animals. Wild game animals and cattle are the main reservoir of &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;. These parasites primarily infect individuals in sub-Saharan Africa because that is where the vector (tsetse fly) is located. The two human forms of the disease also vary greatly in intensity. &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; causes a chronic condition that can remain in a passive phase for months or years before symptoms emerge and the infection can last about three years before death occurs.

&quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot; is the acute form of the disease, and death can occur within months since the symptoms emerge within weeks and it is more virulent and faster developing than &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot;. Furthermore, trypanosomes are surrounded by a coat that is composed of variant surface glycoproteins (VSG). These proteins act to protect the parasite from any lytic factors that are present in human plasma. The host&#x27;s immune system recognizes the glycoproteins present on the coat of the parasite leading to the production of different antibodies (IgM and IgG).

These antibodies will then act to destroy the parasites that circulate in the blood. However, from the several parasites present in the plasma, a small number of them will experience changes in their surface coats resulting in the formation of new VSGs. Thus, the antibodies produced by the immune system will no longer recognize the parasite leading to proliferation until new antibodies are created to combat the novel VSGs. Eventually, the immune system will no longer be able to fight off the parasite due to the constant changes in VSGs and infection will arise.

===Vector===
The tsetse fly (genus &quot;Glossina&quot;) is a large, brown, biting fly that serves as both a host and vector for the trypanosome parasites. While taking blood from a mammalian host, an infected tsetse fly injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites first enter the lymphatic system and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate by binary fission.

The entire life cycle of African trypanosomes is represented by extracellular stages. A tsetse fly becomes infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes when taking a blood meal on an infected mammalian host. In the fly&#x27;s midgut, the parasites transform into procyclic trypomastigotes, multiply by binary fission, leave the midgut, and transform into epimastigotes. The epimastigotes reach the fly&#x27;s salivary glands and continue multiplication by binary fission.

The entire life cycle of the fly takes about three weeks. In addition to the bite of the tsetse fly, the disease can be transmitted by:
* Mother-to-child infection: the trypanosome can sometimes cross the placenta and infect the fetus.
* Laboratories: accidental infections, for example, through the handling of blood of an infected person and organ transplantation, although this is uncommon.
* Blood transfusion
* Sexual contact
Horse-flies (Tabanidae) and stable flies (Muscidae) possibly play a role in the transmission of nagana (the animal form of sleeping sickness) and the human disease form.

=== Pathophysiology ===
Tryptophol is a chemical compound produced by the trypanosomal parasite in sleeping sickness which induces sleep in humans.

==Diagnosis==
The gold standard for diagnosis is the identification of trypanosomes in a sample by microscopic examination. Samples that can be used for diagnosis include ulcer fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, and, during the neurological stage, cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, seroconversion occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot; infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.

Trypanosomes can be detected from samples using two different preparations. A wet preparation can be used to look for the motile trypanosomes. Alternatively, a fixed (dried) smear can be stained using Giemsa&#x27;s or Field&#x27;s technique and examined under a microscope. Often, the parasite is in relatively low abundance in the sample, so techniques to concentrate the parasites can be used before microscopic examination. For blood samples, these include centrifugation followed by an examination of the buffy coat; mini anion-exchange/centrifugation; and the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique. For other samples, such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques include centrifugation followed by an examination of the sediment.

Three serological tests are also available for the detection of the parasite: the micro-CATT (card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis), wb-CATT, and wb-LATEX. The first uses dried blood, while the other two use whole blood samples. A 2002 study found the wb-CATT to be the most efficient for diagnosis, while the wb-LATEX is a better exam for situations where greater sensitivity is required.

==Prevention==
Currently, there are few medically related prevention options for African trypanosomiasis (i.e. no vaccine exists for immunity). Although the risk of infection from a tsetse fly bite is minor (estimated at less than 0.1%), the use of insect repellants, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding tsetse-dense areas, implementing bush clearance methods and wild game culling are the best options to avoid infection available for residents of affected areas.

Regular active and passive surveillance, involving detection and prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control are the backbone of the strategy used to control sleeping sickness. Systematic screening of at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas with high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant people with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses and removes the potential human reservoir. A single case of sexual transmission of West African sleeping sickness has been reported.

In July 2000, a resolution was passed to form the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). The campaign works to eradicate the tsetse vector population levels and subsequently the protozoan disease, by use of insecticide-impregnated targets, fly traps, insecticide-treated cattle, ultra-low dose aerial/ground spraying (SAT) of tsetse resting sites and the sterile insect technique (SIT). The use of SIT in Zanzibar proved effective in eliminating the entire population of tsetse flies but was expensive and is relatively impractical to use in many of the endemic countries afflicted with African trypanosomiasis.

A pilot program in Senegal has reduced the tsetse fly population by as much as 99% by introducing male flies that have been sterilized by exposure to gamma rays.

==Treatment==

The treatment is dependent on if the disease is discovered in the first or second stage of the disease. A requirement for treatment of the second stage is that the drug passes the blood-brain barrier.

===First stage===
The treatment for first-stage disease is fexinidazole by mouth or pentamidine by injection for &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot;. Suramin by injection is used for &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;.

===Second stage===
Fexinidazole may be used for the second stage of TbG, if the disease is not severe. Otherwise a regimen involving the combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine, nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment (NECT), or eflornithine alone appear to be more effective and result in fewer side effects. These treatments may replace melarsoprol when available. NECT has the benefit of requiring fewer injections of eflornithine.

Intravenous melarsoprol was previously the standard treatment for second-stage (neurological phase) disease and is effective for both types. Melarsoprol is the only treatment for second stage &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;; however, it causes death in 5% of people who take it. Resistance to melarsoprol can occur.

Drug development projects.
A major challenge has been to find drugs that readily pass the blood-brain barrier. The latest drug that has come into clinical use is fexinidazol, but promising results have also been obtained with the benzoxaborole drug acoziborole (SCYX-7158). This drug is currently under evaluation as a single-dose oral treatment, which is a great advantage compared to currently used drugs. Another research field that has been extensively studied in &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; is to target its nucleotide metabolism. The nucleotide metabolism studies have both led to the development of adenosine analogues looking promising in animal studies, and to the finding that downregulation of the P2 adenosine transporter is a common way to acquire partial drug resistance against the melaminophenyl arsenical and diamidine drug families (containing melarsoprol and pentamidine, respectively). Drug uptake and degradation are two major issues to consider to avoid drug resistance development. In the case of nucleoside analogues, they need to be taken up by the P1 nucleoside transporter (instead of P2), and they also need to be resistant to cleavage in the parasite.

==Prognosis==
If untreated, &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; almost always results in death, with only a few individuals shown in a long-term 15-year follow-up to have survived after refusing treatment. &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;, being a more acute and severe form of the disease, is consistently fatal if not treated.

Disease progression greatly varies depending on disease form. For individuals who are infected by &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot;, which accounts for 92% of all of the reported cases, a person can be infected for months or even years without signs or symptoms until the advanced disease stage, where it is too late to be treated successfully. For individuals affected by &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;, which accounts for 2% of all reported cases, symptoms appear within weeks or months of the infection. Disease progression is rapid and invades the central nervous system, causing death within a short amount of time.

==Epidemiology==
In 2010, it caused around 9,000 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990. As of 2000, the disability-adjusted life-years (9 to 10 years) lost due to sleeping sickness are 2.0 million. From 2010 to 2014, there was an estimated 55 million people at risk for &quot;gambiense&quot; African Trypanosomiasis and over 6 million people at risk for &quot;rhodesiense&quot; African trypanosomiasis. In 2014, the World Health Organization reported 3,797 cases of Human African Trypanosomiasis when the predicted number of cases was to be 5,000. The number of total reported cases in 2014 is an 86% reduction to the total number of cases reported in 2000.

The disease has been recorded as occurring in 37 countries, all in sub-Saharan Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most affected country in the world, accounting for 75% of the &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; cases. In 2009, the population at risk was estimated at about 69 million with one-third of this number being at a &#x27;very high&#x27; to &#x27;moderate&#x27; risk and the remaining two-thirds at a &#x27;low&#x27; to &#x27;very low&#x27; risk. Since then, the number of people being affected by the disease has continued to decline, with fewer than 1000 cases per year reported from 2018 onwards. Against this backdrop, sleeping sickness elimination is considered a real possibility, with the World Health Organization targeting the elimination of the transmission of the gambiese form by 2030.

==History==

The condition has been present in Africa for thousands of years. Because of a lack of travel between Indigenous people, sleeping sickness in humans had been limited to isolated pockets. This changed after Arab slave traders entered central Africa from the east, following the Congo River, bringing parasites along. Gambian sleeping sickness travelled up the Congo River, and then further east.

An Arab writer of the 14th century left the following description in the case of a sultan of the Mali Kingdom: &quot;His end was to be overtaken by the sleeping sickness (&quot;illat an-nawm&quot;) which is a disease that frequently befalls the inhabitants of these countries, especially their chieftains. Sleep overtakes one of them in such a manner that it is hardly possible to awake him.&quot;

The British naval surgeon John Atkins described the disease on his return from West Africa in 1734:
French naval surgeon Marie-Théophile Griffon du Bellay treated and described cases while stationed aboard the hospital ship &quot;Caravane&quot; in Gabon in the late 1860s.

In 1901, a devastating epidemic erupted in Uganda, killing more than 250,000 people, including about two-thirds of the population in the affected lakeshore areas. According to &quot;The Cambridge History of Africa&quot;, &quot;It has been estimated that up to half the people died of sleeping-sickness and smallpox in the lands on either bank of the lower river Congo.&quot;

The causative agent and vector were identified in 1903 by David Bruce, and the subspecies of the protozoa were differentiated in 1910. Bruce had earlier shown that &quot;T. brucei&quot; was the cause of a similar disease in horses and cattle that was transmitted by the tsetse fly (&quot;Glossina morsitans&quot;).

The first effective treatment, atoxyl, an arsenic-based drug developed by Paul Ehrlich and Kiyoshi Shiga, was introduced in 1910, but blindness was a serious side effect.

Suramin was first synthesized by Oskar Dressel and Richard Kothe in 1916 for Bayer. It was introduced in 1920 to treat the first stage of the disease. By 1922, Suramin was generally combined with tryparsamide (another pentavalent organoarsenic drug), the first drug to enter the nervous system and be useful in the treatment of the second stage of the gambiense form. Tryparsamide was announced in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Medicine&quot; in 1919 and tested in the Belgian Congo by Louise Pearce of the Rockefeller Institute in 1920. It was used during the grand epidemic in West and Central Africa on millions of people and was the mainstay of therapy until the 1960s. American medical missionary Arthur Lewis Piper was active in using tryparsamide to treat sleeping sickness in the Belgian Congo in 1925.

Pentamidine, a highly effective drug for the first stage of the disease, has been used since 1937. During the 1950s, it was widely used as a prophylactic agent in western Africa, leading to a sharp decline in infection rates. At the time, eradication of the disease was thought to be at hand.

The organoarsenical melarsoprol (Arsobal) developed in the 1940s is effective for people with second-stage sleeping sickness. However, 3–10% of those injected have reactive encephalopathy (convulsions, progressive coma, or psychotic reactions), and 10–70% of such cases result in death; it can cause brain damage in those who survive the encephalopathy. However, due to its effectiveness, melarsoprol is still used today. Resistance to melarsoprol is increasing, and combination therapy with nifurtimox is currently under research.

Eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine or DFMO), the most modern treatment, was developed in the 1970s by Albert Sjoerdsma and underwent clinical trials in the 1980s. The drug was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1990. Aventis, the company responsible for its manufacture, halted production in 1999. In 2001, Aventis, in association with Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, signed a long-term agreement to manufacture and donate the drug.

In addition to sleeping sickness, previous names have included negro lethargy, maladie du sommeil (Fr), Schlafkrankheit (Ger), African lethargy, and Congo trypanosomiasis.

==Research==
The genome of the parasite has been sequenced and several proteins have been identified as potential targets for drug treatment. Analysis of the genome also revealed the reason why generating a vaccine for this disease has been so difficult. &quot;T. brucei&quot; has over 800 genes that make proteins the parasite &quot;mixes and matches&quot; to evade immune system detection.

Using a genetically modified form of a bacterium that occurs naturally in the gut of the vectors is being studied as a method of controlling the disease.

Recent findings indicate that the parasite is unable to survive in the bloodstream without its flagellum. This insight gives researchers a new angle with which to attack the parasite.

Trypanosomiasis vaccines are undergoing research.

Additionally, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative has contributed to the African sleeping sickness research by developing a compound called fexinidazole. This project was originally started in April 2007 and enrolled 749 people in the DRC and Central African Republic. The results showed efficacy and safety in both stages of the disease, both in adults and children ≥ 6 years old and weighing ≥ 20 kg. The European Medicines Agency approved it for first and second stage disease outside of Europe in November 2018. The treatment was approved in the DRC in December 2018.

===Funding===
For current funding statistics, human African trypanosomiasis is grouped with kinetoplastid infections. Kinetoplastids refer to a group of flagellate protozoa. Kinetoplastid infections include African sleeping sickness, Chagas&#x27; disease, and Leishmaniasis. Altogether, these three diseases accounted for 4.4 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and an additional 70,075 recorded deaths yearly. For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, African sleeping sickness, Chagas&#x27; disease, and Leishmaniasis each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about US$36.8 million, US$38.7 million, and US $31.7 million, respectively.

For sleeping sickness, funding was split into basic research, drug discovery, vaccines, and diagnostics. The greatest amount of funding was directed towards basic research of the disease; approximately US$21.6 million was directed towards that effort. As for therapeutic development, approximately $10.9 million was invested.

The top funder for kinetoplastid infection research and development are public sources. About 62% of the funding comes from high-income countries while 9% comes from low- and middle-income countries. High-income countries&#x27; public funding is the largest contributor to the neglected disease research effort. However, in recent years, funding from high-income countries has been steadily decreasing; in 2007, high-income countries provided 67.5% of the total funding whereas, in 2012, high-income countries public funds only provided 60% of the total funding for kinetoplastid infections. This downward trend leaves a gap for other funders, such as philanthropic foundations and private pharmaceutical companies to fill.

Much of the progress that has been made in African sleeping sickness and neglected disease research as a whole is a result of the other non-public funders. One of these major sources of funding has come from foundations, which have increasingly become more committed to neglected disease drug discovery in the 21st century. In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for neglected diseases drug development. They have provided US$444.1 million towards neglected disease research in 2012. To date, they have donated over US$1.02 billion towards the neglected disease discovery efforts.

For kinetoplastid infections specifically, they have donated an average of US$28.15 million annually between the years 2007 to 2011. They have labeled human African trypanosomiasis a high-opportunity target meaning it is a disease that presents the greatest opportunity for control, elimination, and eradication, through the development of new drugs, vaccines, public health programs, and diagnostics. They are the second-highest funding source for neglected diseases, immediately behind the US National Institutes of Health. At a time when public funding is decreasing and government grants for scientific research are harder to obtain, the philanthropic world has stepped in to push the research forward.

Another important component of increased interest and funding has come from industry. In 2012, they contributed 13.1% total to the kinetoplastid research and development effort, and have additionally played an important role by contributing to public-private partnerships (PPP) as well as product-development partnerships (PDP). A public-private partnership is an arrangement between one or more public entities and one or more private entities that exists to achieve a specific health outcome or to produce a health product. The partnership can exist in numerous ways; they may share and exchange funds, property, equipment, human resources, and intellectual property. These public-private partnerships and product-development partnerships have been established to address challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, especially related to neglected disease research. These partnerships can help increase the scale of the effort toward therapeutic development by using different knowledge, skills, and expertise from different sources. These types of partnerships are more effective than industry or public groups working independently.

==Other animals and reservoir==

&quot;Trypanosoma&quot; of both the &quot;rhodesiense&quot; and &quot;gambiense&quot; types can affect other animals such as cattle and wild animals. African trypanosomiasis has generally been considered an anthroponotic disease and thus its control program was mainly focused on stopping the transmission by treating human cases and eliminating the vector. However, animal reservoirs were reported to possibly play an important role in the endemic nature of African trypanosomiasis, and for its resurgence in the historic foci of West and Central Africa.

<doc id="141030" wikidata="Q153700" url="?curid=141030" title="Oriana Fallaci">
<text>Oriana Fallaci (; 29 June 1929 – 15 September 2006) was an Italian journalist and author. A member of the Italian resistance movement during World War II, she had a long and successful journalistic career. Fallaci became famous worldwide for her coverage of war and revolution, and her &quot;long, aggressive and revealing interviews&quot; with many world leaders during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

Fallaci&#x27;s book &quot;Interview with History&quot; contains interviews with Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Yasser Arafat, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Willy Brandt, Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Henry Kissinger, South Vietnamese president Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, and North Vietnamese general Võ Nguyên Giáp during the Vietnam War. The interview with Kissinger was published in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, with Kissinger describing himself as &quot;the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse&quot;. Kissinger later wrote that it was &quot;the single most disastrous conversation I have ever had with any member of the press&quot;.

Fallaci also interviewed Deng Xiaoping, Andreas Papandreou, Ayatollah Khomeini, Haile Selassie, Lech Wałęsa, Muammar Gaddafi, Mário Soares, George Habash, and Alfred Hitchcock, among others. After retirement, she returned to the spotlight after writing a series of controversial articles and books critical of Islam that aroused condemnation for Islamophobia as well as popular support.

== Early life ==
Fallaci was born in Florence, Italy, on 29 June 1929. Her father Edoardo Fallaci, a cabinet maker in Florence, was a political activist struggling to put an end to the dictatorship of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini. During World War II she joined the Italian anti-fascist resistance movement &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;, part of &quot;Resistenza&quot;. She later received a certificate for valour from the Italian army. In a 1976 retrospective collection of her works, she remarked:

== Career ==

=== Beginning as a journalist ===
After attaining her secondary school diploma, Fallaci briefly attended the University of Florence where she studied medicine and chemistry. She later transferred to literature but soon dropped out and never finished her studies. Her uncle Bruno Fallaci, himself a journalist, suggested that Fallaci pursue a career in journalism. Fallaci began her career in journalism during her teens, becoming a special correspondent for the Italian paper &quot;Il mattino dell&#x27;Italia centrale&quot; in 1946. Beginning in 1967, she worked as a war correspondent covering the Vietnam War, the Indo-Pakistani War, the Middle East, and in South America.

=== 1960s ===
For many years, Fallaci was a special correspondent for the political magazine &quot;L&#x27;Europeo&quot;, and wrote for a number of leading newspapers and the magazine &quot;Epoca&quot;. In Mexico City, during the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre, Fallaci was shot three times by Mexican soldiers, dragged downstairs by her hair, and left for dead. Her eyewitness account became important evidence disproving the Mexican government&#x27;s denials that a massacre had taken place.

In the 1960s she began conducting interviews, first with people in the world of literature and cinema (published in book form in 1963 as &quot;Gli antipatici&quot;) and later with world leaders (published in the 1973 book &quot;Intervista con la storia&quot;), which have led some to describe her as &quot;during the 1970s and 80s the most famous – and feared – interviewer in the world&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
In the early 1970s, Fallaci had a relationship with the subject of one of her interviews, Alexandros Panagoulis, who had been a solitary figure in the Greek resistance against the military dictatorship known as the Regime of the Colonels. Panagoulis had been captured, heavily tortured and imprisoned for his (unsuccessful) assassination attempt on dictator and former Hellenic Army colonel Georgios Papadopoulos. Panagoulis died in 1976, under controversial circumstances, in a road accident. Fallaci maintained that Panagoulis&#x27; &quot;accident&quot; had been arranged by remnants of the Greek military junta despite the transition to a democracy, and her book &quot;Un Uomo&quot; (&quot;A Man&quot;) was inspired by his life.

During her 1972 interview with Henry Kissinger, Kissinger stated that the Vietnam War was a &quot;useless war&quot; and compared himself to &quot;the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse&quot;. Kissinger later claimed that it was &quot;the single most disastrous conversation I have ever had with any member of the press&quot;. In 1973, she interviewed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. She later stated, &quot;He considers women simply as graceful ornaments, incapable of thinking like a man, and then strives to give them complete equality of rights and duties&quot;. After interviewing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, she described him as &quot;One of the most stupid men I&#x27;ve ever met in my life, maybe the most stupid&quot;.
During her 1979 interview with Ayatollah Khomeini, she addressed him as a &quot;tyrant&quot;, and managed to unveil herself from the chador:

=== 1980s ===

In 1980 Fallaci interviewed Deng Xiaoping. Michael Rank described this interview as the &quot;most revealing ever of any Chinese leader by any western journalist&quot;, during which Deng spoke about Mao &quot;extraordinarily frankly by Chinese standards&quot; whereas most Western interviews with Chinese leaders have been &quot;bland and dull&quot;.

=== Retirement ===
Living in New York City and in a house she owned in Tuscany, Fallaci lectured at the University of Chicago, Yale University, Harvard University and Columbia University.

=== After 9/11 ===
After 11 September 2001, Fallaci wrote three books critical of Islamic extremists and Islam in general, and in both writing and interviews warned that Europe was &quot;too tolerant of Muslims&quot;. The first book was &quot;The Rage and the Pride&quot; (initially a four-page article in &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, the major national newspaper in Italy). In this book, she calls for the destruction of what is now called Islam.

She wrote that the &quot;sons of Allah breed like rats&quot;, and in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; interview in 2005, she said that Europe was no longer Europe but &quot;Eurabia&quot;. &quot;The Rage and the Pride&quot; and &quot;The Force of Reason&quot; both became bestsellers, the former selling over one million copies in Italy and 500,000 in the rest of Europe, and are considered part of the &quot;Eurabia genre&quot;. Her third book in the same vein, &quot;Oriana Fallaci intervista sé stessa – L&#x27;Apocalisse&quot; (&quot;The Apocalypse&quot;), sold some two million copies globally, the three books together selling four million copies in Italy.

Her writings have been translated into 21 languages, including English, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Urdu, Greek, Swedish, Polish, Hungarian, Hebrew, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, Persian, Slovenian, Danish and Bulgarian.

== Personal life and death ==
On 27 August 2005, Fallaci had a private audience with Pope Benedict XVI at Castel Gandolfo. Although an atheist, Fallaci reportedly had great respect for the Pope and expressed admiration for his 2004 essay titled &quot;If Europe Hates Itself&quot;. Despite being an atheist, in &quot;The Force of Reason&quot;, she claimed that she was also a &quot;Christian atheist&quot;. Fallaci was a vocal critic of Islam, especially after the Iranian Revolution and the 9/11 attacks. When rumours of the construction of an Islamic centre in the city of Siena intensified, Fallaci told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; &quot;If the Muslims build this Islamic center, she will blow it up with the help of her friends&quot;.

Fallaci died on 15 September 2006, in her native Florence, from cancer. She was buried in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori in the southern suburb of Florence, Galluzzo, alongside her family members and a stone memorial to Alexandros Panagoulis, her late companion.

== Legacy ==
As of 2018, streets or squares have been renamed after her in Pisa, Arezzo, and Genoa. A public garden has also been dedicated to her in Sesto San Giovanni, an industrial town close to Milan.

In July 2019, the lower chamber of the Italian Parliament approved the creation of low-denomination treasury bills that could also be used as a de facto parallel currency to the euro. According to the plan&#x27;s main proponent, the League&#x27;s MP Claudio Borghi, the 20-euro bill should bear a picture of Fallaci.

An Italian television series was created about her life, titled Miss Fallaci (2024). 

In 2024, a biographical novel, &quot;&quot;, was published by author Anastasia Rubis based on the true story of Fallaci&#x27;s career and personal life.

== Awards ==
Fallaci twice received the St. Vincent Prize for journalism (1967, 1971). She also received the Bancarella Prize (1970) for &quot;Nothing, and So Be It&quot;; Viareggio Prize (1979), for &quot;Un uomo: Romanzo&quot;; and Prix Antibes, 1993, for &quot;Inshallah&quot;. She received a D.Litt. from Columbia College (Chicago).

On 30 November 2005, in New York City, Fallaci received the Annie Taylor Award for courage from the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. She was honoured for the &quot;heroism and the values&quot; that rendered her &quot;a symbol of the fight against Islamic fascism and a knight of the freedom of humankind&quot;. The Annie Taylor Award is annually awarded to people who have demonstrated unusual courage in adverse conditions and great danger. David Horowitz, founder of the center, described Fallaci as &quot;a General in the fight for freedom&quot;. On 8 December 2005, Fallaci was awarded the Ambrogino d&#x27;oro (Golden Ambrogino), the highest recognition of the city of Milan. She also received the Jan Karski Eagle Award.

Acting on a proposal by the Minister of Education Letizia Moratti, on 14 December 2005, the president of the Italian Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, awarded Fallaci a gold medal for her cultural contributions (&quot;Benemerita della Cultura&quot;). The state of her health prevented her from attending the ceremony. She wrote in a speech: &quot;This gold medal moves me because it gratifies my efforts as writer and journalist, my front line engagement to defend our culture, love for my country and for freedom. My current well-known health situation prevents me from travelling and receiving in person this gift that for me, a woman not used to medals and not too keen on trophies, has an intense ethical and moral significance.&quot;

On 12 February 2006, the president of Tuscany, Riccardo Nencini, awarded Fallaci a gold medal from the Council of Tuscany. Nencini reported that the prize was awarded as Fallaci was During the award ceremony, held in New York City, the writer talked about her attempt to create a caricature of Mohammed, following the polemic relating to similar caricatures that had appeared in French and Dutch newspapers. 

She received the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy–USA Foundation in 2010 (in memoriam).

== Controversy ==
Fallaci received much public attention for her controversial writings and statements on Islam and European Muslims. She claimed that Muslims were colonizing Europe through immigration and high fertility rates, in line with the Eurabia concept.

Fallaci received criticism as well as support in Italy, where her books have sold over one million copies. At the first European Social Forum, which was held in Florence in November 2002, Fallaci invited the people of Florence to cease commercial operations and stay home. Furthermore, she compared the ESF to the Nazi occupation of Florence. Protest organizers declared, &quot;We have done it for Oriana, because she hasn&#x27;t spoken in public for the last 12 years and hasn&#x27;t been laughing in the last 50&quot;.

In 2002, in Switzerland, the Islamic Center and the Somal Association of Geneva, SOS Racisme of Lausanne, along with a private citizen, sued Fallaci for the allegedly racist content of &quot;The Rage and the Pride&quot;. In November 2002, a Swiss judge issued an arrest warrant for violations of articles 261 and 261 bis of the Swiss criminal code and requested the Italian government to either prosecute or extradite her. Italian Minister of Justice Roberto Castelli rejected the request on the grounds that the Constitution of Italy protects freedom of speech.

In May 2005, Adel Smith, president of the Union of Italian Muslims, launched a lawsuit against Fallaci charging that &quot;some of the things she said in her book &quot;The Force of Reason&quot; are offensive to Islam&quot;. Smith&#x27;s attorney cited 18 phrases, most notably a reference to Islam as &quot;a pool that never purifies&quot;. Consequently, an Italian judge ordered Fallaci to stand trial in Bergamo on charges of &quot;defaming Islam&quot;. The preliminary trial began on 12 June, and on 25 June, Judge Beatrice Siccardi decided that Fallaci should indeed stand trial beginning on 18 December. Fallaci accused the judge of having disregarded the fact that Smith had called for her murder and defamed Christianity.

In France, some Arab-Muslim and anti-defamation organisations such as MRAP and &quot;Ligue des Droits de l&#x27;Homme&quot; launched lawsuits against Oriana Fallaci, charging that &quot;The Rage and the Pride&quot; and &quot;The Force of Reason&quot; (&quot;La Rage et l&#x27;Orgueil&quot; and &quot;La Force de la Raison&quot; in their French translations) were &quot;offensive to Islam&quot; and &quot;racist&quot;. Her lawyer, Gilles William Goldnadel, president of the France-Israel Organization, was also Alexandre del Valle&#x27;s lawyer during similar lawsuits against del Valle.

On 3 June 2005, Fallaci published on the front page of the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; a highly controversial article titled &quot;Noi Cannibali e i figli di Medea&quot; (&quot;We cannibals and Medea&#x27;s offspring&quot;), urging women not to vote for a public referendum about artificial insemination that was held on 12 and 13 June 2006.

In her 2004 book &quot;Oriana Fallaci intervista sé stessa – L&#x27;Apocalisse&quot;, Fallaci expressed her opposition to same-sex marriage, arguing that it &quot;subvert[s] the biological concept of family&quot; and calling it &quot;a fashionable whim, a form of exhibitionism&quot;, and also against parenting by same-sex couples, declaring it a &quot;distorted view of life&quot;. She also asserted the existence of a &quot;gay lobby&quot;, through which &quot;the homosexuals themselves are discriminating against others&quot;.

In the June 2006 issue of &quot;Reason&quot;, American libertarian writer Cathy Young wrote: &quot;Oriana Fallaci&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;The Rage and the Pride&quot; makes hardly any distinction between radical Islamic terrorists and Somali street vendors who supposedly urinate on the corners of Italy&#x27;s great cities.&quot; Christopher Hitchens, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, called the book &quot;a sort of primer in how not to write about Islam&quot;, describing it as &quot;replete with an obsessive interest in excrement, disease, sexual mania, and insect-like reproduction, insofar as these apply to Muslims in general and to Muslim immigrants in Europe in particular&quot;.

<doc id="141141" wikidata="Q223068" url="?curid=141141" title="3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate">
<text>3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) (IUPAC name 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-yl hydroxy(diphenyl)acetate; US Army code EA-2277; NATO code BZ; Soviet code Substance 78) is an odorless and bitter-tasting military incapacitating agent. BZ is an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors whose structure is the ester of benzilic acid with an alcohol derived from quinuclidine.

==Physicochemical characteristics==
BZ is a white crystalline powder with a bitter taste. It is odorless and nonirritating with delayed symptoms several hours after contact. It is stable in most solvents, with a half-life of three to four weeks in moist air; even heat-producing munitions can disperse it. It is extremely persistent in soil and water and on most surfaces. BZ is soluble in water, soluble in dilute acids, trichloroethylene, dimethylformamide, and most organic solvents, and insoluble with aqueous alkali.

==Effects==
As a powerful anticholinergic agent, BZ produces a syndrome of effects known as the anticholinergic toxidrome: these include both psychological and physiological effects, with the most incapacitating effect being a state of delirium characterized by cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, and inability to perform basic tasks. The usual syndrome of physical anticholinergic effects are also present, including mydriasis (potentially to the point of temporary blindness), tachycardia, dermal vasodilation, xerostomia and hyperthermia. The readily-observable symptoms of the anticholinergic toxidrome are famously characterized by the mnemonic &quot;Mad as a hatter, red as a beet, dry as a bone and blind as a bat&quot; (and variations thereof).

== Toxicity ==
Based on data from more than 500 reported cases of accidental atropine overdose and deliberate poisoning, the median lethal oral dose is estimated to be approximately 450 mg (with a shallow probit slope of 1.8). Some estimates of lethality with BZ have been grossly erroneous, and ultimately the safety margin for BZ is inconclusive due to lack of human data at higher dosage ranges, though some researchers have estimated it to be 0.5 to 3.0 mg/kg and an LD01 is 0.2 to 1.4 mg/kg (Rosenblatt, Dacre, Shiotsuka, &amp; Rowlett, 1977).

== Treatment ==
Antidotes for BZ include 7-MEOTA, which can be administered in tablet or injection form. Atropine and tacrine (THA) have also been used as treatments, THA having been shown to reduce the effects of BZ within minutes. Some military references suggest the use of physostigmine to temporarily increase synaptic acetylcholine concentrations.

==History==

===Invention and research===
BZ was invented by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffman-LaRoche in 1951. The company was investigating anti-spasmodic agents, similar to tropine, for treating gastrointestinal ailments when the chemical was discovered. It was then investigated for possible use in ulcer treatment, but was found unsuitable. At this time the United States military investigated it along with a wide range of possible nonlethal, psychoactive and psychotomimetic incapacitating agents including psychedelic drugs such as LSD and THC, dissociative drugs such as ketamine and phencyclidine, potent opioids such as fentanyl, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. By 1959, the United States Army showed significant interest in deploying it as a chemical warfare agent. It was originally designated &quot;TK&quot;, but when it was standardized by the Army in 1961, it received the NATO code name &quot;BZ&quot;, the Chemical Corps initially referred to BZ as CS4030, then later as EA 2277. The agent commonly became known as &quot;Buzz&quot; because of this abbreviation and the effects it had on the mental state of the human volunteers intoxicated with it in research studies at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. As described in retired Army psychiatrist James Ketchum&#x27;s autobiographical book &quot;Chemical Warfare: Secrets Almost Forgotten&quot; (2006), work proceeded in 1964 when a general envisioned a scheme to incapacitate an entire trawler with aerosolized BZ; this effort was dubbed Project DORK. BZ was ultimately weaponized for delivery in the M44 generator cluster and the M43 cluster bomb, until all such stocks were destroyed in 1989 as part of a general downsizing of the US chemical warfare program.

In 2022 a documentary film,&quot; Dr Delirium and The Edgewood Experiments&quot;, was broadcast on Discovery+, featuring an interview with Ketchum not previously shown.

===Use and alleged use===

In February 1998, the British Ministry of Defence accused Iraq of having stockpiled large amounts of a glycolate anticholinergic incapacitating agent known as ‘Agent 15’. Agent 15 is an alleged Iraqi incapacitating agent that is likely to be chemically identical to BZ or closely related to it. Agent 15 was reportedly stockpiled in large quantities prior to and during the Persian Gulf War. However, after the war the CIA concluded that Iraq had not stockpiled or weaponized Agent 15.

According to Konstantin Anokhin, professor at the Institute of Normal Physiology in Moscow, BZ was the chemical agent used to incapacitate terrorists during the 2002 Nord-Ost siege, but at least 115 hostages perished due to overdose; but many other agents have also been proposed, and none definitively confirmed.

In January 2013, an unidentified U.S. administration official, referring to an undisclosed U.S. State Department cable, claimed that &quot;Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15, a hallucinogenic chemical similar to BZ, was used in Homs&quot;. However, in response to these reports a U.S. National Security Council spokesman stated,
The reporting we have seen from media sources regarding alleged chemical weapons incidents in Syria has not been consistent with what we believe to be true about the Syrian chemical weapons program.

=== Legality ===
BZ is listed as a Schedule 2 compound by the OPCW (Szinicz, 2005).

<doc id="141163" wikidata="Q1070094" url="?curid=141163" title="Subnormal number">
<text>In computer science, subnormal numbers are the subset of denormalized numbers (sometimes called denormals) that fill the underflow gap around zero in floating-point arithmetic. Any non-zero number with magnitude smaller than the smallest positive normal number is &quot;subnormal&quot;, while &quot;denormal&quot; can also refer to numbers outside that range.

== Terminology ==
In some older documents (especially standards documents such as the initial releases of IEEE 754 and the C language), &quot;denormal&quot; is used to refer exclusively to subnormal numbers. This usage persists in various standards documents, especially when discussing hardware that is incapable of representing any other denormalized numbers, but the discussion here uses the term &quot;subnormal&quot; in line with the 2008 revision of IEEE 754. In casual discussions the terms &quot;subnormal&quot; and &quot;denormal&quot; are often used interchangeably, in part because there are &quot;no&quot; denormalized IEEE binary numbers outside the subnormal range.

The term &quot;number&quot; is used rather loosely, to describe a particular sequence of digits, rather than a mathematical abstraction; see Floating-point arithmetic for details of how real numbers relate to floating-point representations. &quot;Representation&quot; rather than &quot;number&quot; may be used when clarity is required.

== Definition ==
Mathematical real numbers may be approximated by multiple floating-point representations. One representation is defined as &quot;normal&quot;, and others are defined as &quot;subnormal&quot;, &quot;denormal&quot;, or &quot;unnormal&quot; by their relationship to &quot;normal&quot;.

In a &quot;normal&quot; floating-point value, there are no leading zeros in the significand (also commonly called mantissa); rather, leading zeros are removed by adjusting the exponent (for example, the number 0.0123 would be written as ). Conversely, a denormalized floating-point value has a significand with a leading digit of zero. Of these, the subnormal numbers represent values which if normalized would have exponents below the smallest representable exponent (the exponent having a limited range).

The significand (or mantissa) of an IEEE floating-point number is the part of a floating-point number that represents the significant digits. For a positive normalised number, it can be represented as &quot;m&quot;0.&quot;m&quot;1&quot;m&quot;2&quot;m&quot;3...&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot;−2&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 (where &quot;m&quot; represents a significant digit, and &quot;p&quot; is the precision) with non-zero &quot;m&quot;0. Notice that for a binary radix, the leading binary digit is always 1. In a subnormal number, since the exponent is the least that it can be, zero is the leading significant digit (0.&quot;m&quot;1&quot;m&quot;2&quot;m&quot;3...&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot;−2&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1), allowing the representation of numbers closer to zero than the smallest normal number. A floating-point number may be recognized as subnormal whenever its exponent has the least possible value.

By filling the underflow gap like this, significant digits are lost, but not as abruptly as when using the &quot;flush to zero on underflow&quot; approach (discarding all significant digits when underflow is reached). Hence the production of a subnormal number is sometimes called &quot;gradual underflow&quot; because it allows a calculation to lose precision slowly when the result is small.

In IEEE 754-2008, denormal numbers are renamed &quot;subnormal numbers&quot; and are supported in both binary and decimal formats. In binary interchange formats, subnormal numbers are encoded with a biased exponent of 0, but are interpreted with the value of the smallest allowed exponent, which is one greater (i.e., as if it were encoded as a 1). In decimal interchange formats they require no special encoding because the format supports unnormalized numbers directly.

Mathematically speaking, the normalized floating-point numbers of a given sign are roughly logarithmically spaced, and as such any finite-sized normal float cannot include zero. The subnormal floats are a linearly spaced set of values, which span the gap between the negative and positive normal floats.

== Background ==
Subnormal numbers provide the guarantee that addition and subtraction of floating-point numbers never underflows; two nearby floating-point numbers always have a representable non-zero difference. Without gradual underflow, the subtraction &quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot; can underflow and produce zero even though the values are not equal. This can, in turn, lead to division by zero errors that cannot occur when gradual underflow is used.

Subnormal numbers were implemented in the Intel 8087 while the IEEE 754 standard was being written. They were by far the most controversial feature in the K-C-S format proposal that was eventually adopted, but this implementation demonstrated that subnormal numbers could be supported in a practical implementation. Some implementations of floating-point units do not directly support subnormal numbers in hardware, but rather trap to some kind of software support. While this may be transparent to the user, it can result in calculations that produce or consume subnormal numbers being much slower than similar calculations on normal numbers.

== IEEE ==
In IEEE binary floating-point formats, &quot;subnormals&quot; are represented by having a zero exponent field with a non-zero significand field.

No other denormalized numbers exist in the IEEE binary floating-point formats, but they &quot;do&quot; exist in some other formats, including the IEEE decimal floating-point formats.

== Performance issues ==
Some systems handle subnormal values in hardware, in the same way as normal values. Others leave the handling of subnormal values to system software (&quot;assist&quot;), only handling normal values and zero in hardware. Handling subnormal values in software always leads to a significant decrease in performance. When subnormal values are entirely computed in hardware, implementation techniques exist to allow their processing at speeds comparable to normal numbers. However, the speed of computation remains significantly reduced on many modern x86 processors; in extreme cases, instructions involving subnormal operands may take as many as 100 additional clock cycles, causing the fastest instructions to run as much as six times slower.

This speed difference can be a security risk. Researchers showed that it provides a timing side channel that allows a malicious web site to extract page content from another site inside a web browser.

Some applications need to contain code to avoid subnormal numbers, either to maintain accuracy, or in order to avoid the performance penalty in some processors. For instance, in audio processing applications, subnormal values usually represent a signal so quiet that it is out of the human hearing range. Because of this, a common measure to avoid subnormals on processors where there would be a performance penalty is to cut the signal to zero once it reaches subnormal levels or mix in an extremely quiet noise signal. Other methods of preventing subnormal numbers include adding a DC offset, quantizing numbers, adding a Nyquist signal, etc. Since the SSE2 processor extension, Intel has provided such a functionality in CPU hardware, which rounds subnormal numbers to zero.

== Disabling subnormal floats at the code level ==
=== Intel SSE ===
Intel&#x27;s C and Fortran compilers enable the (denormals-are-zero) and (flush-to-zero) flags for SSE by default for optimization levels higher than . The effect of is to treat subnormal input arguments to floating-point operations as zero, and the effect of is to return zero instead of a subnormal float for operations that would result in a subnormal float, even if the input arguments are not themselves subnormal. clang and gcc have varying default states depending on platform and optimization level.

A non-C99-compliant method of enabling the and flags on targets supporting SSE is given below, but is not widely supported. It is known to work on Mac OS X since at least 2006.
#include &lt;fenv.h&gt;
#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
// Sets DAZ and FTZ, clobbering other CSR settings.
// See https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libm/Libm-287.1/Source/Intel/, fenv.c and fenv.h.
fesetenv(FE_DFL_DISABLE_SSE_DENORMS_ENV);
// fesetenv(FE_DFL_ENV) // Disable both, clobbering other CSR settings.
For other x86-SSE platforms where the C library has not yet implemented this flag, the following may work:
#include &lt;xmmintrin.h&gt;
_mm_setcsr(_mm_getcsr() | 0x0040); // DAZ
_mm_setcsr(_mm_getcsr() | 0x8000); // FTZ
_mm_setcsr(_mm_getcsr() | 0x8040); // Both
_mm_setcsr(_mm_getcsr() &amp; ~0x8040); // Disable both
The and macros wrap a more readable interface for the code above.

// To enable DAZ
#include &lt;pmmintrin.h&gt;
_MM_SET_DENORMALS_ZERO_MODE(_MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_ON);
// To enable FTZ
#include &lt;xmmintrin.h&gt;
_MM_SET_FLUSH_ZERO_MODE(_MM_FLUSH_ZERO_ON);
Most compilers will already provide the previous macro by default, otherwise the following code snippet can be used (the definition for FTZ is analogous):

#define _MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_MASK 0x0040
#define _MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_ON 0x0040
#define _MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_OFF 0x0000

#define _MM_SET_DENORMALS_ZERO_MODE(mode) _mm_setcsr((_mm_getcsr() &amp; ~_MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_MASK) | (mode))
#define _MM_GET_DENORMALS_ZERO_MODE() (_mm_getcsr() &amp; _MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_MASK)
The default denormalization behavior is mandated by the ABI, and therefore well-behaved software should save and restore the denormalization mode before returning to the caller or calling code in other libraries.

=== ARM ===
AArch32 NEON (SIMD) FPU always uses a flush-to-zero mode, which is the same as . For the scalar FPU and in the AArch64 SIMD, the flush-to-zero behavior is optional and controlled by the bit of the control register – FPSCR in Arm32 and FPCR in AArch64.

One way to do this can be:
#if defined(__arm64__) || defined(__aarch64__)
 uint64_t fpcr;
 asm( &quot;mrs %0, fpcr&quot; : &quot;=r&quot;( fpcr )); //Load the FPCR register
 asm( &quot;msr fpcr, %0&quot; :: &quot;r&quot;( fpcr | (1 « 24) )); //Set the 24th bit (FTZ) to 1
#endif
Some ARM processors have hardware handling of subnormals.

<doc id="141176" wikidata="Q2115958" url="?curid=141176" title="Incapacitating agent">
<text>Incapacitating agent is a chemical or biological agent which renders a person unable to harm themselves or others, regardless of consciousness.

Lethal agents are primarily intended to kill, but incapacitating agents can also kill if administered in a potent enough dose, or in certain scenarios.

The term &quot;incapacitation,&quot; when used in a general sense, is not equivalent to the term &quot;disability&quot; as used in occupational medicine and denotes the inability to perform a task because of a quantifiable physical or mental impairment. In this sense, any of the chemical warfare agents may incapacitate a victim; however, by the military definition of this type of agent, incapacitation refers to impairments that are temporary and nonlethal. Thus, riot-control agents are incapacitating because they cause temporary loss of vision due to blepharospasm, but they are not considered military incapacitants because the loss of vision does not last long. Although incapacitation may result from physiological changes such as mucous membrane irritation, diarrhea, or hyperthermia, the term &quot;incapacitating agent&quot; as militarily defined refers to a compound that produces temporary and nonlethal impairment of military performance by virtue of its psychobehavioral or CNS effects.

In biological warfare, a distinction is also made between bio-agents as Lethal Agents (e.g., &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;, Botulinum toxin) or Incapacitating Agents (e.g., &quot;Brucella suis&quot;, &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).

== History ==

===Early uses===
The use of chemicals to induce altered states of mind in an adversary dates back to antiquity and includes the use of plants of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), such as the thornapple (&quot;Datura stramonium&quot;), that contain various combinations of anticholinergic alkaloids. The use of nonlethal chemicals to render an enemy force incapable of fighting dates back to at least 600 B.C. when Solon&#x27;s soldiers threw hellebore roots into streams supplying water to enemy troops, who then developed diarrhea. In 184 B.C., Hannibal&#x27;s army used belladonna plants to induce disorientation, and the Bishop of Münster in A.D. 1672 attempted to use belladonna-containing grenades in an assault on the city of Groningen.

In 1881, members of a French railway surveying expedition crossing Tuareg territory in North Africa ate dried dates that tribesmen had apparently deliberately contaminated with Egyptian henbane (&quot;Hyoscyamus muticus&quot;, or &quot;H. falezlez&quot;), to devastating effect. In 1908, 200 French soldiers in Hanoi became delirious and experienced hallucinations after being poisoned with a related plant. More recently, accusations of Soviet use of incapacitating agents internally and in Afghanistan were never substantiated.

===The 20th century===
Following World War II, the United States military investigated a wide range of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral, chemical incapacitating agents to include psychedelic indoles such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and the tetrahydrocannabinol derivative DMHP, certain tranquilizers, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was assigned the NATO code &quot;BZ&quot; and was weaponized beginning in the 1960s for possible battlefield use. (Although BZ figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 movie, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, as the compound responsible for hallucinations and violent deaths in a fictitious American battalion in Vietnam, this agent never saw operational use.) Destruction of American stockpiles of BZ began in 1988 and is now complete.

==== US survey and testing programs ====

By 1958 a search of the tropics for venomous animal species in order to isolate and synthesize their toxins was prioritized. For example, snake venoms were studied and The College of Medical Evangelists was under contract to isolate puffer fish poison. The New England Institute for Medical Research and Fort Detrick were studying the properties and biological activity of the Botulinum toxin molecule. The U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Laboratories were isolating shellfish toxin and trying to obtain its structure.

A Central Intelligence Agency Project Artichoke document reads: &quot;Not all viruses have to be lethal ... the objective includes those that act as short-term and long-term incapacitants.&quot; Pine Bluff Arsenal was a rickittsiae and virus production center and biological agents against wheat and rice fields were tested in several locations the southern U.S. as well as in Okinawa.

The concept of &quot;humane warfare&quot; with widespread use of incapacitating or deliriant drugs such as LSD or Agent BZ to stun an enemy, capture them alive, or separate friend from foe had been available in locations such as Berlin since the 1950s, an initial focus of US CBW development was the offensive use of diseases, drugs, and substances that could completely incapacitate an enemy for several days with some lesser possibility of death using a variety of chemical, biological, radiological, or toxin agents. The US Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) authorized operational field testing of LSD in interrogations in the early 1960s. The first field tests were conducted in Europe by an Army Special Purpose Team (SPT) during May to August 1961 in tests known as Project THIRD CHANCE. The second series of field tests, Project DERBY HAT, were conducted by an Army Special Purpose Team in the Far East during August to November 1962.

A study of possible uses of migratory birds in germ warfare was funded through Camp Detrick for years using the Smithsonian as a cover. Government documents have linked the Smithsonian to the CIA&#x27;s mind control program known as MKULTRA. The CIA were interested in bird migration patterns for CBW research under MKULTRA where, a Subproject 139 designated &quot;Bird Disease Studies&quot; at Pennsylvania State University. An agents purchase of a copy of the book &quot;Birds of Britain, Europe,&quot; is recorded as part of what was described in a financial accounting of the MKULTRA program as a continuous project on bird survey in special areas. Sampling of native migratory organisms with a focus on birds provided to researchers the natural habitat of disease causing fungus, viruses, and bacteria as well as the established (or potential) vectors for them. The sampling also provided exotic tropical viruses and toxins from the various organisms collected on both land and sea. The studies, including the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program (POBSP) were conducted by the Smithsonian Institution and Project SHAD crews on Pacific islands and atolls. The &quot;bird cruises&quot; were subsequently found to be a U.S. Army cover for the prelude to chemical, biological, and entomological warfare experiments related to Deseret Test Center, Project 112, and Project SHAD.

A U.S. War Departments report notes that &quot;in addition to the results of human experimentation much data is available from the Japanese experiments on animals and food crops.&quot; German researchers have found that records of the Entomology Institute at the Dachau concentration camp show that under orders of Schutzstaffel (SS) leader Heinrich Himmler, the Nazis began studying mosquitoes as an offensive biological warfare vector against humans in 1942. It was generally thought by historians that the Nazis only intended ever to use biological weapons defensively.

Project 112 included objectives such as “the feasibility of an offshore release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a vector for infectious diseases,” and “the feasibility of a biological attack against an island complex.”
&quot;The feasibility of area coverage with adedes aegypti mosquitoes was based on the Avon Park, Florida mosquito trials.&quot; 
Several CIA documents, and a 1975 Congressional committee, revealed that several locations in Florida, as well as Avon Park, hosted experiments with mosquito-borne viruses and other biological substances. Formerly top-secret documents related to the CIA&#x27;s Project MKNAOMI prove that the mosquitoes used in Avon Park were the Aedes aegypti type.
&quot;A 1978 Pentagon publication, entitled &quot;Biological Warfare: Secret Testing &amp; Volunteers,&quot; reveals that the Army&#x27;s Chemical Corps and Special Operations and Projects Divisions at Fort Detrick conducted &#x27;tests&#x27; similar to the Avon Park experiments but the bulk of the documentation concerning this highly classified and covert work is still held secret by the Pentagon.&quot;

==Sleeping gas==
Sleeping gas is an oneirogenic general anaesthetic that is used to put subjects into a state in which they are not conscious of what is happening around them. Most sleeping gases have undesirable side effects, or are effective at doses that approach toxicity. 

It is primarily used for major surgeries and to render non-dangerous animals unconscious for research purposes.

Examples of modern volatile anaesthetics that may be considered sleeping gases are BZ, halothane vapour (Fluothane), methyl propyl ether (Neothyl), methoxyflurane (Penthrane), and the undisclosed fentanyl derivative delivery system used by the FSB in the Moscow theater hostage crisis.

===Side effects===
Possible side effects might not prevent use of sleeping gas by criminals willing to murder, or carefully control the dose on a single already sleepy individual. There are reports of thieves spraying sleeping gases on campers, or in train compartments in some parts of Europe. Alarms are sold to detect such attacks and alert the victim.

===Moscow theatre siege===
There is one documented case of incapacitating agents being used in recent years. In 2002, Chechen terrorists took a large number of hostages in the Moscow theatre siege, and threatened to blow up the entire theatre if any attempt was made to break the siege. An incapacitating agent was used to disable the terrorists whilst the theatre was stormed by special forces. However, the incapacitating agent, unknown at that time, caused many of the hostages to die. The terrorists were rendered unconscious, but roughly 15% of the 800 people exposed were killed by the gas. The situation was not helped by the fact that the authorities kept the nature of the incapacitating agent secret from doctors trying to treat its victims. At the time, the gas was reported to be an unknown incapacitating agent called &quot;Kolokol-1&quot;. The Russian Health Minister Yuri Shevchenko later stated that the incapacitating agent used was a fentanyl derivative.

Scientists at Britain&#x27;s chemical and biological defense labs at Porton Down analyzed residue from the clothing of three hostages and the urine of one hostage rescued during the Moscow theater hostage crisis and found two chemical derivatives of fentanyl, remifentanil and carfentanil.

===Bolivian rapes===
In a Mennonite community in Bolivia, eight men were convicted of raping 130 women in Manitoba Colony over a four-year period from 2005 to 2009, by spraying &quot;a chemical used to anesthetize cows&quot; through the victims&#x27; open bedroom windows. The perpetrators would then wait for the women to be incapacitated, whereupon they entered the residences to commit the crimes. Later, the women would awaken to a pounding headache, find blood, semen or dirt on their sheets, and would sometimes discover their extremities had also been bound. Most did not remember the attacks, although a few had vague, fleeting memories of men on top of them. Several men and boys were also suspected of having been raped. While additional actors were thought to have participated, they were never identified nor prosecuted; in fact, the rapes did not stop with the incarceration of the original eight men.

When two of these men were caught in the act of entering one of the women&#x27;s homes, they implicated friends in the rapes to local authorities. Eventually nine Manitoba men, ages 19 to 43, were charged with using a spray adapted from an anesthetic by a veterinarian from a neighboring Mennonite colony to subdue their victims, then raping them. Eight of the accused were found guilty of rape, one escaped from the local jail before the end of the trial, and the veterinarian was found guilty of being an accomplice to the rapes. According to at least three residents of the colony, a local prosecutor, and a local journalist, these &quot;ghost rapes&quot; continue despite imprisonment of the men convicted in the 130 original rapes.

==Rape drugs==

A date rape drug, also called a predator drug, is any drug that can be used as incapacitating agent to assist in the execution of drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA). The most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim ingested drugs willingly for recreational purposes, or had them administered surreptitiously: it is the latter type of assault that the term &quot;date rape drug&quot; most often refers to.

==&quot;Knockout gas&quot;==

A fictional form of incapacitating agent, sometimes known as &quot;knockout gas&quot;, has been a staple of pulp detective and science fiction novels, movies and television shows. It is presented in various forms, but generally is supposed to be a gas or aerosol that affords a harmless method of rendering characters quickly and temporarily unconscious without physical contact. This is in contrast to chloroform, a liquid anesthetic—itself a common element in genre fiction—that requires a victim to be physically subdued before it can be applied.

A number of notable fictional characters created in the early 20th century, both villains and heroes, were associated with the use of knockout gas: Fu Manchu, Dr. Mabuse, Doc Savage, Batman, and The Avenger. A military knockout gas called the &quot;Gas of Peace&quot; is an important plot device in H. G. Wells&#x27;s 1936 movie &quot;Things to Come&quot;. It had become a familiar trope by the 1960s, when it was utilized in the X-Men comics. A famous example recurs in every opening sequence of the British TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967–68).

The U.S. Army psychiatrist James S. Ketchum, who worked for almost a decade on the U.S. military&#x27;s top secret psychochemical warfare program, relates a story relevant to the concept of a &quot;knockout gas&quot; in his 2006 memoir, &quot;Chemical Warfare Secrets Almost Forgotten&quot;. In 1970, Ketchum and his boss were visited by CIA agents for a brainstorming session at his Maryland laboratory. The agents wanted to know if an incapacitating agent (his specialty) could be used to intervene in the ongoing hijacking of a Tel Aviv aircraft by Palestinian terrorists without injuring the hostages. We considered the pros and cons of using incapacitating agents and various other options. As it turned out, we could not imagine a scenario in which any available agent could be pumped into the airliner without the hijackers possibly reacting violently and killing passengers. Ultimately, the standoff was resolved by other means.

Arguably, the use of fentanyl derivatives by Russian authorities in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis (see above) is a real-life instance of deployment of a &quot;knockout gas&quot;. Of course, the criterion that the gas reliably render subjects temporarily and harmlessly unconscious was not fulfilled in this case, as the procedure killed about fifteen percent of those subjected to it.

<text>A chess problem, also called a chess composition, is a puzzle created by the composer using chess pieces on a chessboard, which presents the solver with a particular task. For instance, a position may be given with the instruction that White is to move first, and checkmate Black in two moves against any possible defence. A chess problem fundamentally differs from play in that the latter involves a struggle between Black and White, whereas the former involves a competition between the composer and the solver. Most positions which occur in a chess problem are unrealistic in the sense that they are very unlikely to occur in over-the-board play. There is a good deal of specialized jargon used in connection with chess problems.
==Definition==
The term chess problem is not sharply defined: there is no clear demarcation between chess compositions on the one hand and puzzle or tactical exercises on the other. In practice, however, the distinction is very clear. There are common characteristics shared by compositions in the problem section of chess magazines, in specialist chess problem magazines, and in collections of chess problems in book form.

==Features==
Not every chess problem has every one of these features, but most have several:

* The position is &quot;composed&quot; – that is, it has not been taken from an actual game, but has been invented for the specific purpose of providing a problem. Although a constraint on orthodox chess problems is that the original position be reachable via a series of legal moves from the starting position, most problem positions would not arise in over-the-board play.
* There is a specific &quot;stipulation&quot;, that is, a goal to be achieved; for example, to checkmate Black within a specified number of moves.
* There is a &quot;theme&quot; (or combination of themes) that the problem has been composed to illustrate: chess problems typically instantiate particular ideas.
* The problem exhibits &quot;economy&quot; in its construction: no greater force is employed than that required to render the problem sound (that is, to guarantee that the problem&#x27;s intended solution is indeed a solution and that it is the problem&#x27;s only solution).
* The problem has . Problems are experienced not only as puzzles but as objects of beauty. This is closely related to the fact that problems are organised to exhibit clear ideas in as economical a manner as possible.

==Tactical puzzles==
Problems can be contrasted with tactical puzzles often found in chess columns or magazines in which the task is to find the best move or sequence of moves (usually leading to mate or gain of material) from a given position. Such puzzles are often taken from actual games, or at least have positions which look as if they could have arisen during a game, and are used for instructional purposes. Most such puzzles fail to exhibit the above features.

==Types of problems==

There are various different types of chess problems:

*Directmates: White to move first and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves against any defence. These are often referred to as &quot;mate in &quot;, where is the number of moves within which mate must be delivered. In composing and solving competitions, directmates are further broken down into three classes:
**Two-movers: White to move and checkmate Black in two moves against any defence.
**Three-movers: White to move and checkmate Black in no more than three moves against any defence.
**More-movers: White to move and checkmate Black in moves against any defence, where is some particular number greater than three.
**Many-movers: White to move and checkmate Black in a great number of moves. Problems have been composed in which White must mate Black in over 100 moves; the current record for such a composition is over 200 moves. These usually involve frequent repetitions of the same manoeuvre in order to force detrimental pawn advances.
*Helpmates: Black to move first cooperates with White to get Black&#x27;s own king mated in a specified number of moves.
*Selfmates: White moves first and forces Black (in a specified number of moves) to checkmate White.
*Helpselfmates: White to move first cooperates with Black to get a position of selfmate in one move.
*Reflexmates: a form of selfmate with the added stipulation that each side give mate if it is able to do so. When this stipulation applies only to Black, it is a &quot;semi-reflexmate&quot;.
*Seriesmovers: one side makes a series of moves without reply to achieve a stipulated aim. Check may not be given except on the last move. A seriesmover may take various forms:
**Seriesmate: a directmate with White playing a series of moves without reply to checkmate Black.
**Serieshelpmate: a helpmate in which Black plays a series of moves without reply after which White plays one move to checkmate Black.
**Seriesselfmate: a selfmate in which White plays a series of moves leading to a position in which Black is forced to give mate.
**Seriesreflexmate: a reflexmate in which White plays a series of moves leading to a position in which Black can, and therefore must, give mate.
*Studies: an orthodox problem in which the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw. Almost all studies are endgame positions. Studies are composed chess problems, but because their stipulation is open-ended (the win or draw does not have to be achieved within any particular number of moves) they are usually thought of as distinct from problems and as a form of composition that is closer to the puzzles of interest to over-the-board players. Indeed, composed studies have often extended our knowledge of endgame theory. But again, there is no clear dividing line between the two kinds of positions.

In all the above types of problem, castling is assumed to be allowed unless it can be proved by retrograde analysis (see below) that the rook in question or king must have previously moved. &quot;En passant&quot; captures, on the other hand, are assumed to be legal, unless it can be proved that the pawn to be captured must have moved two squares on the previous move.

There are several other types of chess problem which do not fall into any of the above categories. Some of these are really coded mathematical problems, expressed using the geometry and pieces of the chessboard. A famous such problem is the knight&#x27;s tour, in which one is to determine the path of a knight that visits each square of the board exactly once. Another is the eight queens problem, in which eight queens are to be placed on the board so that none is attacking any of the others.

Of far greater relation to standard chess problems, however, are the following, which have a rich history and have been revisited many times, with magazines, books and prizes dedicated to them:

*Retrograde analysis problems: such problems, often also called &quot;retros&quot;, typically present the solver with a diagram position and a question. In order to answer the question, the solver must work out the history of the position, that is, must work backwards from the given position to the previous move or moves that have been played. A problem employing retrograde analysis may, for example, present a position and ask questions like &quot;What was White&#x27;s last move?&quot;, &quot;Has the bishop on c1 moved?&quot;, &quot;Is the black knight actually a promoted pawn?&quot;, &quot;Can White castle?&quot;, etc. Some retrograde analysis may also have to be employed in more conventional problems (directmates and so on) to determine, for example, whether an &quot;en passant&quot; pawn capture or castling is possible. The most important subset of retro problems are:
**Shortest proof games: the solver is given a position and must construct a game, starting from the normal game array, which ends in that position. The two sides cooperate to reach the position, but all moves must be legal. Usually the number of moves required to reach the position is given, though sometimes the task is simply to reach the given position in the smallest number of moves.
*Construction tasks: no diagram is given in construction tasks; instead, the aim is to construct a game or position with certain features. For example, Sam Loyd devised the problem: &quot;Construct a game which ends with black delivering discovered checkmate on move four&quot; (published in &quot;Le Sphinx&quot;, 1866 – the solution is 1.f3 e5 2.Kf2 h5 3.Kg3 h4+ 4.Kg4 d5#); while all White moves are unique (see Beauty in chess problems), the Black ones are not. A unique problem is: &quot;Construct a game with black b-pawn checkmating on move four&quot; (from &quot;Shortest construction tasks map&quot; in External links section; the unique solution is 1.d4 c6 2.Kd2 Qa5+ 3.Kd3 Qa3+ 4.Kc4 b5#). Some construction tasks ask for a maximum or minimum number of effects to be arranged, for example a game with the maximum possible number of consecutive discovered checks, or a position in which all sixteen pieces control the minimum number of squares. A special class are games uniquely determined by their last move like &quot;3...Rxe5+&quot; or &quot;4...b5#&quot; from above.

Across most of the above genres, there is great interest in exploring fairy chess, in which non-standard boards, pieces or rules apply.

==Beauty in chess problems==

The role of aesthetic evaluation in the appreciation of chess problems is very significant, and indeed most composers and solvers consider such compositions to be an art form. Vladimir Nabokov wrote about the &quot;originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity&quot; of creating chess problems and spent considerable time doing so. There are no official standards by which to distinguish a beautiful problem from a poor one and such judgments can vary from individual to individual as well as from generation to generation. Such variation is to be expected when it comes to aesthetic appraisal. Nevertheless, modern taste generally recognises the following elements to be important in the aesthetic evaluation of a problem:

*The problem position must be legal. That is to say, the diagram must be reachable by legal moves beginning with the initial game array. It is not considered a defect if the diagram can only be reached via a game containing what over-the-board players would consider gross blunders.
*The first move of the problem&#x27;s solution (the &quot;key move&quot; or &quot;key&quot;) must be unique. A problem which has two keys is said to be &quot;cooked&quot; and is judged to be &quot;unsound&quot; or defective. (Exceptions are problems which are composed to have more than one solution which are thematically related to one another in some way; this type of problem is particularly common in helpmates.)
*Ideally, in directmates, there should be a unique White move after Black move. A choice of White moves (other than the key) is a &quot;dual&quot;. Duals are often tolerated if the problem is strong in other regards and if the duals occur in lines of play that are subsidiary to the main theme.
*The solution should illustrate a theme or themes, rather than emerging from disjointed calculation. Many of the more common themes have been given names by problemists (see chess problem terminology for a list).
*The key move of the solution should not be obvious. Obvious moves such as checks, captures, and (in directmates) moves which restrict the movement of the black king make for bad keys. Keys which deprive the black king of some squares to which it could initially move (&quot;flight squares&quot;), but at the same time make available an equal or greater number of flight squares are acceptable. Key moves which prevent the enemy from playing a checking move are also undesirable, particularly in cases where there is no mate provided after the checking move. In general, the weaker (in terms of ordinary over-the-board play) the key move is the less obvious it will be, and hence the more highly prized it will be.
*There should be no promoted pawns in the initial position. For example, if White has three knights, one of them must clearly have been promoted; the same is true of two . There are more subtle cases: if f1 is empty, a white bishop stands on b5 and there are white pawns on e2 and g2, then the bishop must be a promoted pawn (there is no way the original bishop could have gotten past those unmoved pawns). A piece such as this, which does not leave a player with pieces additional to those at the start of a game, but which nonetheless must have been promoted, is called &quot;obtrusive&quot;. The presence of obtrusive units constitutes a smaller flaw than the presence of more obviously promoted units. 
*The problem should be economical. There are several facets to this desideratum. For one thing, every piece on the board should serve a purpose, either to enable the actual solution, or to exclude alternative solutions. Extra units should not be added to create &quot;red herrings&quot; (this is called &quot;dressing the board&quot;), except in rare cases where this is part of the theme. If the theme can be shown with fewer total units, it should be. For another, the problem should not employ more moves than is needed to exhibit the particular theme(s) at its heart; if the theme can be shown in fewer moves, it should be.

==Examples==
To the right is a directmate problem composed by Thomas Taverner in 1881.

The key move is 1.Rh1. This is difficult to find because it makes no threat – instead, it puts Black in zugzwang, a situation in which the player must move, yet every move leads to a disadvantage. Each of Black&#x27;s nineteen legal replies allows an immediate mate. For example, if Black defends with 1...Bxh7, the d5-square is no longer guarded, and White mates with 2.Nd5#. Or if Black plays 1...Re5, Black blocks that escape square for his king allowing 2.Qg4#. If Black plays 1...Rf6, then 2.Rh4#. Yet if Black could only pass (i.e., make no move at all), White would have no way to mate on his second move. The full solution is as follows:

:1 Rh1 and now:
::1...Bxh7, 2.Nd5# (unguards d5)
::1...Bf7, 2.Qf5# (interferes with rook’s guard of f5)
::1...Be6, 2.e3# (interferes with rook’s guard of e3)
::1...Bd5, 2.Nxd5# (unguards d5)
::1...Bxc7, 2.Rh4# (unguards h4)
::1...Be7, 2.e3# (interferes with rook’s guard of e3)
::1...Bf6, 2.Qf5# (interferes with rook’s guard of f5)
::1...Bg5, 2.Qh2# (blocks king’s flight to g5)
::1...Bh4, 2.Rxh4# (unguards h4)
::1...Rf7, 2.Nd5# (interferes with bishop’s guard of d5)
::1...Rf6, 2.Rh4# (interferes with bishop’s guard of h4)
::1...Rf5, 2.Qxf5# (unguards f5)
::1...Re7, 2.Rh4# (interferes with bishop’s guard of h4)
::1...Re6, 2.Nd5# (interferes with bishop’s guard of d5)
::1...Re5, 2.Qg4# (blocks king’s flight to e5)
::1...Re4, 2.fxe4# (allows pawn capture discovering check)
::1...Re3, 2.Bh2# (blocks king’s flight to e3)
::1...Rxe2+, 2.Nxe2# (allows capture on unguarded square e2)
::1...c3, 2.Nd3# (unguards d3)

The thematic approach to solving is to notice then that in the original position, Black is already almost in zugzwang. If Black were compelled to play first, only Re3 and Bg5 would not allow immediate mate. However, each of those two moves blocks a flight square for the black king, and once White has removed his rook from h2 White can put some other piece on that square to deliver mate: 1...Re3 2.Bh2# and 1...Bg5 2.Qh2#.

The arrangement of the black rooks and bishops, with a pair of adjacent rooks flanked by a pair of bishops, is known to problemists as Organ Pipes. This arrangement is designed to illustrate the effect of mutual Black interferences: for example, consider what happens after the key if Black plays 1...Bf7. White now mates with 2.Qf5#, a move which is only possible because the bishop Black moved has got in the way of the rook&#x27;s guard of f5 – this is known as a &quot;self-interference&quot;. Similarly, if Black tries 1...Rf7, this interferes with the bishop&#x27;s guard of d5, allowing White to mate with Nd5#. Mutual interferences like this, between two pieces on one square, are known as Grimshaw interferences, and are the theme of this problem. The problem exhibits four such interferences, on squares e6, e7, f6, and f7.
Some problems involve a humorous trick or twist. The problem to the right, shown in Norwegian broadcaster NRK&#x27;s airings from the World Championships in Dubai 2021, calls for White to mate in just one move. The trick is to recognize that despite the arrangement of the Black men, the board is actually viewed from the White side, as shown by the black king standing on a square of its own color, rather than on the opposite color as in the standard opening position. Thus the solution is 1.Nd3#; the knight is &quot;behind&quot; the black pawns and cannot be captured.

==Abbreviations==
For reasons of space and internationality, various abbreviations are often used in chess problem journals to indicate a problem&#x27;s stipulation (whether it is a mate in two, helpmate in four, or whatever). The most common are:

* &quot;#&quot; abbreviates &quot;checkmate&quot;
* &quot;=&quot; abbreviates &quot;stalemate&quot; (occasionally &quot;&quot;p&quot;, standing for &quot;pat&quot;&quot;, the French for stalemate, is used instead)
* &quot;h&quot; abbreviates &quot;helpmate&quot;
* &quot;s&quot; abbreviates &quot;selfmate&quot;
* &quot;r&quot; abbreviates &quot;reflexmate&quot;
* &quot;ser-&quot; abbreviates &quot;series&quot;

These are combined with a number to indicate in how many moves the goal must be achieved. &quot;#3&quot;, therefore, indicates a mate in three, while &quot;ser-h=14&quot; indicates a series help stalemate in 14 (i.e., Black makes 14 moves in a row such that White can subsequently make one move to deliver stalemate).

In studies, the symbols &quot;+&quot; and &quot;=&quot; are used to indicate &quot;White to play and win&quot; and &quot;White to play and draw&quot; respectively.

==Tournaments==
Various tournaments (or &quot;tourneys&quot;) exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems.

Composition tourneys may be or . In formal tourneys, the competing problems are not published before they are judged, while in informal tourneys they are. Informal tourneys are often run by problem magazines and other publications with a regular problem section; it is common for every problem to have been published in a particular magazine within a particular year to be eligible for an informal award. Formal tourneys are often held to commemorate a particular event or person. The World Chess Composing Tournament (WCCT) is a formal tourney for national teams organised by the Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions (PCCC).

In both formal and informal tourneys, entries will normally be limited to a particular genre of problem (for example, mate in twos, moremovers, helpmates) and may or may not have additional restrictions (for example, problems in patrol chess, problems showing the Lacny theme, problems using fewer than nine units). Honours are usually awarded in three grades: these are, in descending order of merit, prizes, honourable mentions, and commendations. As many problems as the judge sees fit may be placed in each grade, and the problems within each grade may or may not be ranked (so an award may include a 1st Honourable Mention, a 2nd Honourable Mention, and a 3rd Honourable Mention, or just three unranked Honourable Mentions).

After an award is published, there is a period (typically around three months) in which individuals may claim honoured problems are &quot;anticipated&quot; (that is, that an identical problem, or nearly so, had been published at an earlier date) or unsound (i.e., that a problem has cooks or no solution). If such claims are upheld, the award may be adjusted accordingly. At the end of this period, the award becomes final. It is normal to indicate any honour a problem has received when it is republished.

===Solving tournaments===
Solving tournaments also fall into two main types. In tourneys conducted by correspondence, the participants send their entries by post or e-mail. These are often run on similar terms to informal composition tourneys; indeed, the same problems which are entries in the informal composition tourney are often also set in the solving tourney. It is impossible to eliminate the use of computers in such tournaments, though some problems, such as those with particularly long solutions, will not be well-suited to solution by computer.

Other solving tourneys are held with all participants present at a particular time and place. They have only a limited amount of time to solve the problems, and the use of any solving aid other than a chess set is prohibited. The most notable tournament of this type is the World Chess Solving Championship, organised by the PCCC.

In both types of tourney, each problem is worth a specified number of points, often with bonus points for finding cooks or correctly claiming no solution. Incomplete solutions are awarded an appropriate proportion of the points available. The solver amassing the most points is the winner.

==Titles==
Just as in over-the-board play, the titles Grandmaster, International Master and FIDE Master are awarded by FIDE via the Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions (PCCC) for especially distinguished problem and study composers and solvers (unlike over-the-board chess, however, there have not been any women-only equivalents to these titles in problem chess).

For composition, the International Master title was established in 1959, with André Chéron, Arnoldo Ellerman, Alexander Gerbstmann, Jan Hartong, Cyril Kipping and Marian Wróbel being the first honorary recipients. In subsequent years, qualification for the IM title, as well as for the GM title (first awarded in 1972 to Genrikh Kasparyan, Lev Loshinsky, Comins Mansfield, and Eeltje Visserman) and the FM title (first awarded 1990) has been determined on the basis of the number of problems or studies a composer had selected for publication in the FIDE Albums. These albums are collections of the best problems and studies composed in a particular three-year period, as selected by FIDE-appointed judges from submitted entries. Each problem published in an album is worth 1 point; each study is worth 1⅔; joint compositions are worth the same divided by the number of composers. For the FIDE Master title, a composer must accumulate 12 points; for the International Master title, 25 points are needed; and for the Grandmaster title, a composer must have 70 points.

For solvers, the GM and IM titles were both first awarded in 1982; the FM title followed in 1997. GM and IM titles can only be gained by participating in the official World Chess Solving Championship (WCSC): to become a GM, a solver must score at least 90 percent of the winner&#x27;s points and on each occasion finish in at least tenth place three times within ten successive WCSCs. For the IM title they must score at least 80 percent of the winner&#x27;s points and each time finish in at least fifteenth place twice within five successive WCSCs; alternatively, winning a single WCSC or scoring as many points as the winner in a single WCSC will earn the IM title. For the FM title, the solver must score at least 75 percent of the winners points and each time finish within the top 40 percent of participants in any two PCCC-approved solving competitions.

The title International Judge of Chess Compositions is given to individuals considered capable of judging composing tourneys at the highest level.

<text>In archaeology, a tool stone is a type of stone that is used to manufacture stone tools,
or tools that use stone as raw material.

Generally speaking, tools that require a sharp edge are made using cryptocrystalline materials that fracture in an easily controlled conchoidal manner.
Cryptocrystalline tool stones include flint and chert, which are fine-grained sedimentary materials; rhyolite and felsite, which are igneous flowstones; and obsidian, a form of natural glass created by igneous processes. These materials fracture in a predictable fashion, and are easily resharpened. For more information on this subject, see lithic reduction.

Large-grained materials such as basalt, granite and sandstone may also be used as tool stones, but for a very different purpose: they are ideal for ground stone artifacts. Whereas cryptocrystalline materials are most useful for killing and processing animals, large-grained materials are usually used for processing plant matter. Their rough faces often make excellent surfaces for grinding plant seeds. With much effort, some large-grained stones may be ground down into awls, adzes, and axes.

<text>Peter Langtoft, also known as Peter of Langtoft (; ; died ), was an English historian and chronicler who took his name from the small village of Langtoft in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

Langtoft was an Augustinian canon regular at Bridlington Priory who wrote a history of England in Anglo-Norman verse, popularly known as Langtoft&#x27;s Chronicle. The history narrates the history of England from the legendary founding of Britain by Brutus to the death of King Edward I. The first part of Langtoft&#x27;s chronicle is translated from Wace&#x27;s (&quot;Tale of Brutus&quot;), and the second part is drawn from a number of sources, including Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s (&quot;History of the English&quot;). The third part is widely considered to be original work by Langtoft, and he includes in it details not recorded elsewhere such as the fate of Gwenllian, daughter of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. On the whole, the chronicle is virulently anti-Scottish and famously contains nine &#x27;songs&#x27;, in both Anglo-Norman and Middle English, supposedly capturing the taunts between English and Scottish soldiers during the Anglo-Scottish conflicts of the late 13th and early 14th centuries.

Langtoft&#x27;s Chronicle was the source of the second part of the Chronicle of Robert Mannyng, also known as Robert of Brunne, completed around 1338. Piers Langtoft&#x27;s Chronicle as translated, illustrated, and improved by Mannyng was later transcribed and published in two volumes by Thomas Hearne in 1725.

<doc id="141264" wikidata="Q7245691" url="?curid=141264" title="Prismatic blade">
<text>In archaeology, a prismatic blade is a long, narrow, specialized stone flake tool with a sharp edge, like a small razor blade. Prismatic blades are flaked from stone cores through pressure flaking or direct percussion. This process results in a very standardized finished tool and waste assemblage. The most famous and most prevalent prismatic blade material is obsidian, as obsidian use was widespread in Mesoamerica, though chert, flint, and chalcedony blades are not uncommon. The term is generally restricted to Mesoamerican archaeology, although some examples are found in the Old World, for example in a Minoan grave in Crete.

Prismatic blades were used for cutting and scraping, and have been reshaped into other tool types, such as projectile points and awls.

==Morphology==
Prismatic blades are often trapezoidal in cross section, but very close in appearance to an isosceles trapezoid. Triangular blades (in cross-section) are also common. The ventral surface of the prismatic blade is very smooth, sometimes bearing slight rippling reflecting the direction of applied force and a very small bulb of applied force (indicative of pressure reduction). Flake scars are absent on the ventral surface of these blades, though eraillure flakes are sometimes present on the bulb. The dorsal surface, on the other hand, exhibits scar ridges running parallel to the long axis of the blade. These facets are created by the previous removal of blades from the core. The proximal end contains the blade&#x27;s striking platform and its bulb of applied force, while the distal end will consist of a snap break, a feather termination, or a stepped termination.

==Production==
Obsidian prismatic blade production was ubiquitous in Mesoamerica, and these tools can be found at a large majority of Mesoamerican archaeological sites from the Preclassic period on until the arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century. Ethnohistoric sources recount the process of prismatic blade production. Fray Motolinia, a Spanish observer, recorded:

The production of prismatic blades creates not only a very standardized final product, but also a standardized waste assemblage. The analysis of obsidian debitage can reveal whether or not prismatic blade production occurred at a site and, if it had, what stages of production the process included. In other words, the types of manufacturing waste present (e.g., rejuvenation flakes and/or blades, platform rejuvenation flakes, etc.) at a site can inform archaeologists about the stage in which blades were being produced.

<text>Dumfries and Galloway (; ) is one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland, located in the western part of the Southern Uplands. It is bordered by East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, and South Lanarkshire to the north; Scottish Borders to the north-east; the English county of Cumbria, the Solway Firth, and the Irish Sea to the south, and the North Channel to the west. The administrative centre and largest settlement is the town of Dumfries. The second largest town is Stranraer, located to the west of Dumfries on the North Channel coast.

Dumfries and Galloway corresponds to the historic shires of Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Wigtownshire, the last two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The three counties were combined in 1975 to form a single region, with four districts within it. The districts were abolished in 1996, since when Dumfries and Galloway has been a unitary local authority. For lieutenancy purposes, the area is divided into three lieutenancy areas called Dumfries, Wigtown, and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, broadly corresponding to the three historic counties.

== History and geography ==
===History===

The term &quot;Dumfries and Galloway&quot; has been used since at least the 19th century – by 1911 the three counties had a united sheriffdom under that name. Dumfries and Galloway covers the majority of the western area of the Southern Uplands, it also hosts Scotland&#x27;s most Southerly point, at the Mull of Galloway in the west of the region.

===Geography===


====Regions====
The Dumfries and Galloway Council region is composed of counties and their sub-areas. From east to west:
* Dumfriesshire County
** the sub-area of Dumfriesshire – Annandale
** the sub-area of Dumfriesshire – Eskdale
** the sub-area of Dumfriesshire – Nithsdale
* Kirkcudbrightshire County
** the sub-area of Kirkcudbrightshire – Stewartry (archaically, Desnes)
* Wigtownshire County
** the sub-area of Wigtownshire – Machars (archaically, Farines)--divided into census areas (civil parish areas)
** the sub-area of Wigtownshire – Rhins of Galloway divided into census areas (civil parish areas)

====Water systems====

The region has a number of south running water systems which break through the Southern Uplands creating the main road, and rail, arteries north–south through the region and breaking the hills up into a number of ranges.

* River Cree valley carries the A714 north-westward from Newton Stewart to Girvan and Water of Minnoch valley which lies just west of the Galloway Hills carries a minor road northward through Glentrool village into South Ayrshire. This road leaves the A714 at Bargrennan.
* Water of Ken and River Dee form a corridor through the hills called the Glenkens which carries the A713 road from Castle Douglas to Ayr. The Galloway Hills lie to the west of this route through the hills and the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills lie to the east.
* River Nith rises between Dalmellington and New Cumnock in Ayrshire and runs east then south down Nithsdale to Dumfries. Nithsdale carries both the A76 road and the rail line from Dumfries to Kilmarnock. It separates the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills from the Lowther Hills which lie east of the Nith.
* River Annan combines with Evan Water and the River Clyde to form one of the principal routes into central Scotland from England – through Annandale and Clydesdale – carrying the M74 and the west coast railway line. This gap through the hills separates the Lowthers from the Moffat Hills.
* River Esk enters the Solway Firth just south of Gretna having travelled south from Langholm and Eskdalemuir. The A7 travels up Eskdale as far as Langholm and from Langholm carries on up the valley of Ewes Water to Teviothead where it starts to follow the River Teviot to Hawick. Eskdale itself heads north west from Langholm through Bentpath and Eskdalemuir to Ettrick and Selkirk.

====Transportation====

The A701 branches off the M74 at Beattock, goes through the town of Moffat, climbs to Annanhead above the Devil&#x27;s Beef Tub (at the source of the River Annan) before passing the source of the River Tweed and carrying on to Edinburgh. Until fairly recent times the ancient route to Edinburgh travelled right up Annandale to the Beef Tub before climbing steeply to Annanhead. The present road ascends northward on a ridge parallel to Annandale but to the west of it which makes for a much easier ascent.

From Moffat the A708 heads north east along the valley of Moffat Water (Moffatdale) on its way to Selkirk. Moffatdale separates the Moffat hills (to the north) from the Ettrick hills to the south.

====National scenic areas====
There are three National scenic areas within this region.

* Nith Estuary: this area follows the River Nith southward from just south of Dumfries into the Solway Firth. Dumfries itself has a rich history going back over 800 years as a Royal Burgh (1186). It is particularly remembered as the place where Robert the Bruce murdered the Red Comyn in 1306 before being crowned King of Scotland – and where Robert Burns spent his last years. His mausoleum is in St Michael&#x27;s graveyard. Going down the east bank is the village of Glencaple, Caerlaverock Castle, Caerlaverock Wild Fowl Trust, an ancient Roman fort on Ward Law Hill and nearby in Ruthwell is the Ruthwell Cross and the Brow Well where Robert Burns &quot;took the waters&quot; and bathed in the Solway just before his death. On the west bank, there are several walks and cycle routes in Mabie Forest, Kirkconnell Flow for the naturalist, the National Museum of Costume just outside New Abbey and Sweetheart Abbey within the village. Criffel (569 metres) offers the hill walker a reasonably modest walk with views across the Solway to the Lake District. The house of John Paul Jones founder of the American Navy is also open to visitors near Kirkbean.
* East Stewartry Coast: this takes in the coast line from Balcary Point eastward across Auchencairn Bay and the Rough Firth past Sandyhills to Mersehead. There are several coastal villages within this area – Auchencairn, Kippford, Colvend, Rockcliffe, and Portling. There is also a round tower at Orchardton and the islands of Hestan Isle and Rough Island can be reached at low tide outside the breeding season for birds. Mersehead is a wildfowl reserve. The area has a number of coastal paths.
* Fleet Valley: this area takes in Fleet Bay with its holiday destinations of Auchenlarie, Mossyard Bay, Cardoness, Sandgreen and Carrick Shore. The area also includes the town of Gatehouse of Fleet and the historic villages of Anworth and Girthon – there is a castle at Cardoness in the care of Historic Scotland.

== Transport ==

Transport in the region is operated by bus companies Houston&#x27;s, Stagecoach Western, McCall&#x27;s coaches, and a variety of other small operators. Train operators in the region are, ScotRail, TransPennine Express and Avanti West Coast. The region has seven working railway stations. All are on the Glasgow South Western Line, except Lockerbie which is on the West Coast Main Line.
* Stranraer railway station
* Kirkconnel railway station
* Sanquhar railway station
* Dumfries railway station
* Annan railway station
* Gretna Green railway station
* Lockerbie railway station

The mainline from Dumfries railway station via Newton Stewart to Stranraer Harbour railway station, was closed under the Beeching cuts. The line previously connected London Euston and the West Coast Main Line with the ferries to Larne Harbour railway station and the Port of Belfast.

The Port Road line to Stranraer was the last to go in June 1965, leaving only the original G&amp;SWR main line open to serve the Stranraer. The Beeching cuts ended the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway and Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railway has resulted in adverse mileage to connect Stranraer with a longer line via Kilmarnock and Ayr.

The area is served by buses which connect the main population centres. Express bus services link the main towns with Glasgow, Ayr, Edinburgh and Carlisle. Local bus services also operate across the region. Dumfries and Galloway is home to two ports which have services to Northern Ireland, both are in the West of the region. Stena Line and P&amp;O Irish Sea both have a port in the village of Cairnryan. The region also has no commercial airports; the nearest are Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Carlisle Lake District Airport. The region does host a number of private airfields.
The town of Lockerbie was the scene of the Pan Am Flight 103 terrorist attack on 21 December 1988.

The main roads to and from the region are:
* M6
* A74(M)
* A75
* A76
* A77
* A701
* A709

== Emergency services ==
As with the whole of Scotland, Police Scotland is the police force for the region and Scotland as a whole since it was formed from the merger of Scotland&#x27;s previous regional police forces. Its predecessor, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary (dissolved 2014) was the smallest police force in the United Kingdom. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (formerly Dumfries and Galloway Fire and Rescue Service) provides firefighting services across the region. The Coastguard, Lifeboats, Moffat mountain rescue and Galloway Mountain Rescue also offer emergency services across Dumfries and Galloway.

Nith Inshore Rescue is based at Glencaple. This independent lifeboat provides water rescue cover for the River Nith, surrounding rivers and inland water. Nith Inshore Rescue is a declared facility for HM Coastguard, the control centre and overseeing authority responsible for call outs.

NHS Dumfries and Galloway provides healthcare services across the region. The two main hospitals are the Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary in Dumfries and Galloway Community Hospital in Stranraer.

==Governance==


===Administrative history===
Prior to 1975, the area that is now Dumfries and Galloway was administered as three separate counties: Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Wigtownshire. The counties of Scotland originated as sheriffdoms, which were established from the twelfth century, consisting of a group of parishes over which a sheriff had jurisdiction. An elected county council was established for each county in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.

The three county councils were abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. A region called Dumfries and Galloway was created covering the area of the three counties, which were abolished as administrative areas. The region contained four districts:
*Annandale and Eskdale, covering the eastern part of Dumfriesshire.
*Nithsdale, covering the western part of Dumfriesshire and a small part of Kirkcudbrightshire.
*Stewartry, covering most of Kirkcudbrightshire.
*Wigtown, covering all of Wigtownshire and a small part of Kirkcudbrightshire.

Further local government reform in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the area&#x27;s four districts abolished, with the Dumfries and Galloway Council taking over the functions they had previously performed. The council continues to use the areas of the four abolished districts as committee areas. The four former districts are also used to define the area&#x27;s three lieutenancy areas, with Nithsdale and Annandale and Eskdale together forming the Dumfries lieutenancy, the Stewartry district corresponding to the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright lieutenancy, and the Wigtown district corresponding to the Wigtown lieutenancy.

The council headquarters is at the Council Offices at 113 English Street in Dumfries, which had been built in 1914 as the headquarters for the old Dumfriesshire County Council, previously being called &quot;County Buildings&quot;.

===Political control===
The first election to the Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the reforms which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control of the council since 1975 has been as follows:

Regional council
Unitary authority
===Leadership===
Since 2007 the council has been required to designate a leader of the council. The leader may also act as the convener, chairing council meetings, or the council may choose to appoint a different councillor to be convener. Prior to 2007 the council sometimes chose to appoint a leader, and sometimes did not. The leaders since 2007 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2022 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:

Three of the independent councillors and the Liberal Democrat sit together as the &#x27;Independent Group&#x27;. Another three independent councillors form the &#x27;Democratic Alliance&#x27; group, and the other independent does not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system of election. This system was introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 to achieve a reasonably proportionately representative outcome. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:

===Wards===
The council area is divided into 12 wards that elect 43 councilors:

<text>In the archaeological study of lithic reduction, the striking platform is the surface on the proximal portion of a lithic flake on which the detachment blow falls; this may be natural or prepared. Types of striking platforms include: 

* Cortex, which consists of an area of cortex used as a platform during initial reduction; 
* Single-faceted, consisting of a flat platform at right angles to the dorsal surface of the flake and most often associated with conchoidal fractures; 
* Double-faceted, a variety of multifaceted, prepared platform, also characteristically flat and associated with conchoidal fractures; 
* Multifaceted, with three or more facets to the platform; 
* Lipped, a platform type resulting from soft hammer biface reduction; and 
* Crushed, which occurs when the platform was crushed beyond easy recognition by the detachment blow.

<text>In music theory, the syntonic comma, also known as the [[chromatic]] diesis, the Didymean comma, the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] comma, or the [[diatonic]] comma is a small comma type interval between two musical notes, equal to the frequency ratio (= 1.0125) (around 21.51 cents). Two notes that differ by this interval would sound different from each other even to untrained ears, but would be close enough that they would be more likely interpreted as out-of-tune versions of the same note than as different notes. The comma is also referred to as a &quot;Didymean comma&quot; because it is the amount by which Didymus corrected the Pythagorean major third (, around 407.82 cents) to a just / harmonicly consonant major third (, around 386.31 cents).

The word &quot;comma&quot; came via Latin from Greek , from earlier = &quot;a thing cut off&quot;, or &quot;a hair&quot;, as in &quot;off by just a hair&quot;.

==Relationships==
The prime factors of the just interval known as the syntonic comma can be separated out and reconstituted into various sequences of two or more intervals that arrive at the comma, such as or (fully expanded and sorted by prime) All sequences of notes that produce that fraction are mathematically valid, but some of the more musical sequences people use to remember and explain the comma&#x27;s composition, occurrence, and usage are listed below:
* The ratio of the two kinds of major second which occur in 5-limit tuning: the greater tone (9:8, about 203.91 cents, or in just C major) and lesser tone (10:9, about 182.40 cents, or ). Namely, or equivalently, sharpening by a comma promotes a lesser major second to a greater second 
* The difference in size between a Pythagorean ditone (frequency ratio 81:64, or about 407.82 cents) and a just major third (5:4, or about 386.31 cents). Namely, 
* The difference between four justly tuned perfect fifths, and two octaves plus a justly tuned major third. A just perfect fifth has a size of 3:2 (about 701.96 cents), and four of them are equal to 81:16 (about 2807.82 cents). A just major third has a size of 5:4 (about 386.31 cents), and one of them plus two octaves (4:1 or exactly 2400 cents) is equal to 5:1 (about 2786.31 cents). The difference between these is the syntonic comma. Namely, 
* The difference between one octave plus a justly tuned minor third (12:5, about 1515.64 cents), and three justly tuned perfect fourths (64:27, about 1494.13 cents). Namely, 12:5 ÷ 64:27 = 81:80.
* The difference between a Pythagorean major sixth (27:16, about 905.87 cents) and a justly tuned or &quot;pure&quot; major sixth (5:3, about 884.36 cents). Namely, 27:16 ÷ 5:3 = 81:80.

On a piano keyboard (typically tuned with 12-tone equal temperament) a stack of four fifths (700 × 4 = 2800 cents) is exactly equal to two octaves (1200 × 2 = 2400 cents) plus a major third (400 cents). In other words, starting from a C, both combinations of intervals will end up at E. Using justly tuned octaves (2:1), fifths (3:2), and thirds (5:4), however, yields two slightly different notes. The ratio between their frequencies, as explained above, is a syntonic comma (81:80). Pythagorean tuning uses justly tuned fifths (3:2) as well, but uses the relatively complex ratio of 81:64 for major thirds. Quarter-comma meantone uses justly tuned major thirds (5:4), but flattens each of the fifths by a quarter of a syntonic comma, relative to their just size (3:2). Other systems use different compromises. This is one of the reasons why 12-tone equal temperament is currently the preferred system for tuning most musical instruments.

Mathematically, by Størmer&#x27;s theorem, 81:80 is the closest superparticular ratio possible with regular numbers as numerator and denominator. A superparticular ratio is one whose numerator is 1 greater than its denominator, such as 5:4, and a regular number is one whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. Thus, although smaller intervals can be described within 5-limit tunings, they cannot be described as superparticular ratios.

==Syntonic comma in the history of music==
The syntonic comma has a crucial role in the history of music. It is the amount by which some of the notes produced in Pythagorean tuning were flattened or sharpened to produce just minor and major thirds. In Pythagorean tuning, the only highly consonant intervals were the perfect fifth and its inversion, the perfect fourth. The Pythagorean major third (81:64) and minor third (32:27) were dissonant, and this prevented musicians from using triads and chords, forcing them for centuries to write music with relatively simple texture.

The syntonic tempering dates to Didymus the Musician, whose tuning of the diatonic genus of the tetrachord replaced one 9:8 interval with a 10:9 interval (lesser tone), obtaining a just major third (5:4) and semitone (16:15). This was later revised by Ptolemy (swapping the two tones) in his &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot; scale (συντονόν διατονικός, &quot;syntonón diatonikós&quot;, from συντονός + διάτονος). The term &quot;syntonón&quot; was based on Aristoxenus, and may be translated as &quot;tense&quot; (conventionally &quot;intense&quot;), referring to tightened strings (hence sharper), in contrast to μαλακόν (&quot;malakón&quot;, from μαλακός), translated as &quot;relaxed&quot; (conventional &quot;soft&quot;), referring to looser strings (hence flatter or &quot;softer&quot;).

This was rediscovered in the late Middle Ages, where musicians realized that by slightly tempering the pitch of some notes, the Pythagorean thirds could be made consonant. For instance, if the frequency of E is decreased by a syntonic comma (81:80), C-E (a major third), and E-G (a minor third) become just. Namely, C-E is narrowed to a justly intonated ratio of

:formula_1

and at the same time E-G is widened to the just ratio of

:formula_2

The drawback is that the fifths A-E and E-B, by flattening E, become almost as dissonant as the Pythagorean wolf fifth. But the fifth C-G stays consonant, since only E has been flattened (C-E × E-G = 5/4 × 6/5 = 3/2), and can be used together with C-E to produce a C-major triad (C-E-G). These experiments eventually brought to the creation of a new tuning system, known as quarter-comma meantone, in which the number of major thirds was maximized, and most minor thirds were tuned to a ratio which was very close to the just 6:5. This result was obtained by narrowing each fifth by a quarter of a syntonic comma, an amount which was considered negligible, and permitted the full development of music with complex texture, such as polyphonic music, or melody with instrumental accompaniment. Since then, other tuning systems were developed, and the syntonic comma was used as a reference value to temper the perfect fifths in an entire family of them. Namely, in the family belonging to the syntonic temperament continuum, including meantone temperaments.

==Comma pump==
The syntonic comma arises in &quot;comma pump&quot; (&quot;comma drift&quot;) sequences such as C G D A E C, when each interval from one note to the next is played with certain specific intervals in just intonation tuning. If we use the frequency ratio 3/2 for the perfect fifths (C-G and D-A), 3/4 for the descending perfect fourths (G-D and A-E), and 4/5 for the descending major third (E-C), then the sequence of intervals from one note to the next in that sequence goes 3/2, 3/4, 3/2, 3/4, 4/5. These multiply together to give
::formula_3
which is the syntonic comma (musical intervals stacked in this way are multiplied together). The &quot;drift&quot; is created by the combination of Pythagorean and 5-limit intervals in just intonation, and would not occur in Pythagorean tuning due to the use only of the Pythagorean major third (64/81) which would thus return the last step of the sequence to the original pitch.

So in that sequence, the second C is sharper than the first C by a syntonic comma . That sequence, or any transposition of it, is known as the comma pump. If a line of music follows that sequence, and if each of the intervals between adjacent notes is justly tuned, then every time the sequence is followed, the pitch of the piece rises by a syntonic comma (about a fifth of a semitone).

Study of the comma pump dates back at least to the sixteenth century when the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Benedetti composed a piece of music to illustrate syntonic comma drift.

Note that a descending perfect fourth (3/4) is the same as a descending octave (1/2) followed by an ascending perfect fifth (3/2). Namely, (3/4) = (1/2) × (3/2). Similarly, a descending major third (4/5) is the same as a descending octave (1/2) followed by an ascending minor sixth (8/5). Namely, (4/5) = (1/2) × (8/5). Therefore, the above-mentioned sequence is equivalent to:
::formula_4
or, by grouping together similar intervals,
::formula_5
This means that, if all intervals are justly tuned, a syntonic comma can be obtained with a stack of four perfect fifths plus one minor sixth, followed by three descending octaves (in other words, four P5 plus one m6 minus three P8).

==Notation==
Moritz Hauptmann developed a method of notation used by Hermann von Helmholtz. Based on Pythagorean tuning, subscript numbers are then added to indicate the number of syntonic commas to lower a note by. Thus a Pythagorean scale is C D E F G A B, while a just scale is C D E1 F G A1 B1. Carl Eitz developed a similar system used by J. Murray Barbour. Superscript positive and negative numbers are added, indicating the number of syntonic commas to raise or lower from Pythagorean tuning. Thus a Pythagorean scale is C D E F G A B, while the 5-limit Ptolemaic scale is C D E−1 F G A−1 B−1.

In Helmholtz-Ellis notation, a syntonic comma is indicated with up and down arrows added to the traditional accidentals. Thus a Pythagorean scale is C D E F G A B, while the 5-limit Ptolemaic scale is C D E F G A B.

Composer Ben Johnston uses a &quot;−&quot; as an accidental to indicate a note is lowered by a syntonic comma, or a &quot;+&quot; to indicate a note is raised by a syntonic comma. Thus a Pythagorean scale is C D E+ F G A+ B+, while the 5-limit Ptolemaic scale is C D E F G A B.

<doc id="141283" wikidata="Q304433" url="?curid=141283" title="Standardization agreement">
<text>In NATO, a standardization agreement (STANAG, redundantly: STANAG agreement) defines processes, procedures, terms, and conditions for common military or technical procedures or equipment between the member countries of the alliance. Each NATO state ratifies a STANAG and implements it within its own military. The purpose is to provide common operational and administrative procedures and logistics, so one member nation&#x27;s military may use the stores and support of another member&#x27;s military.
STANAGs also form the basis for technical interoperability between a wide variety of communication and information systems (CIS) essential for NATO and Allied operations. The Allied Data Publication 34 (ADatP-34) NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles which is covered by STANAG 5524, maintains a catalogue of relevant information and communication technology standards. 

STANAGs are published in English and French, the two official languages of NATO, by the NATO Standardization Office in Brussels.

Among the hundreds of standardization agreements (the total was just short of 1,300) are those for calibres of small arms ammunition, map markings, communications procedures, and classification of bridges.

<text>In lithic reduction, termination type is a characteristic indicating the manner in which the distal end of a lithic flake detaches from a core (Andrefsky 1998:18). Common types include:

* Step/snap termination – these occur when a flake snaps or breaks during removal, resulting in an abrupt right-angle break.
* Hinge termination – results when the applied force rolls away from the core or objective piece, creating a rounded or blunted distal end.
* Overshot/outrepasse/plunging termination - occurs when the applied force dips and removes a section of the opposite margin of the artifact or the distal end of the core. Also referred to as a reverse hinge termination.
* Perverse termination - &quot;twisting&quot; breaks resulting from when the applied force is redirected through the material in a helical fashion;
* Feather/monotomic termination – a smooth termination that results in a feathered distal end. The distal ends of these flakes are only a few molecules thick, are extremely sharp, and indicate a flawless detachment. These are the intended results of some lithic reduction techniques, and are very desirable for opportunistic tool use that does not require retouching or sharpening.

Farmers cultivated the rich soil on the intervales. The Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad diagonally crossed the town. With abundant water power from the Baker River, Wentworth developed into a lumber-producing town with nine sawmills. But disaster struck on August 6, 1856, when dams on the Upper and Lower Baker ponds in Orford breached during a flood, releasing a wall of water down Pond Brook to the Baker River. It raced down the steep, rocky channel, then undermined and washed away Wentworth&#x27;s riverside

<text>Peter Max (born Peter Max Finkelstein, October 19, 1937) is an American artist known for using bright colors in his work. Works by Max are associated with the visual arts and culture of the 1960s, particularly psychedelic art and pop art.

==Early life and education==
Peter Max was born in Berlin, the son of Salla and Jakob Finkelstein, German Jews. They fled Berlin in 1938, settling in Shanghai, China, where they lived for the next ten years. Peter&#x27;s time in Shanghai influenced much of his later work. He loved the colours and the &quot;calligraphic ballet&quot; that he witnessed daily at the Buddhist temple across the street from the family villa.

In 1948, the family moved to Haifa, Israel, where they lived for several years. Peter attended school in Mount Carmel, but was often drawing instead of taking notes. His principal suggested to his parents that he take art lessons after school, and he began to study under Professor Hünik, a Viennese Expressionist.

From Israel, the family continued moving westward and stopped in Paris for several months—an experience that Max said greatly influenced his appreciation for art. In their short time in Paris, Max&#x27;s mother enrolled him in drawing classes at the Louvre, where he began to study Fauvism. After nine months in Paris, Max and his family made their final move, settling in Brooklyn, New York. 

Max and his parents first settled in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in 1953 where he attended Lafayette High School, classmates with future actor Paul Sorvino. In 1956, Max began his formal art training at the Art Students League of New York in Manhattan, studying anatomy, figure drawing and composition under Frank J. Reilly, who had studied at the League alongside Norman Rockwell.

== Career ==

===1960s===
In 1962, Max started a small Manhattan arts studio known as &quot;The Daly &amp; Max Studio,&quot; with friend Tom Daly. Daly and Max were joined by friend and mentor Don Rubbo, and the three worked as a group on books and advertising for which they received industry recognition. Much of their work incorporated antique photographic images as elements of collage. Max&#x27;s interest in astronomy contributed to his self-described &quot;Cosmic &#x27;60s&quot; period, which featured psychedelic, counter culture imagery.

In 1967, Max solidified his place as a counter-cultural icon by designing the flyers for the second ever &#x27;Be In&#x27;, a political gathering of mainly hippies in New York&#x27;s Central Park after the Easter parade on March 26, 1967.

Max appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on August 15, 1968. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 5, 1969 edition under the heading &quot;Peter Max: Portrait of the artist as a very rich man.&quot;

===1970s===
In 1970, many of Max&#x27;s products and posters were featured in the exhibition &quot;The World of Peter Max,&quot; which opened at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. The United States Postal Service commissioned Max to create the 10-cent postage stamp to commemorate the Expo &#x27;74 World&#x27;s Fair in Spokane, Washington, and Max drew a colorful psychedelic scene with a &quot;Cosmic Jumper&quot; and a &quot;Smiling Sage&quot; against a backdrop of a cloud, sun rays and a ship at sea on the theme of &quot;Preserve the Environment.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;His DayGlo-inflected posters became wallpaper for the turn on, tune in, drop out generation.&quot;

On July 4, 1976, Max began his Statue of Liberty series leading to his efforts with Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca to help in the restoration of the statue. Also that year, &quot;Peter Max Paints America&quot; was commissioned by the ASEA of Sweden. The book project commemorated the United States Bicentennial and included the following foreword: &quot;Peter Max Paints America is based on works of art commissioned by ASEA of Sweden on the 200th anniversary of the founding of the United States of America, in sincere recognition of the historic bonds of friendship between the people of Sweden and the people of the United States, recalling that Sweden was one of the first countries to extend its hand in friendship to the new nation.&quot; Max had also been commissioned to design bilingual welcome signs for the US borders, and they were set to be unveiled in 1976; the signs, however, did not go up. Max&#x27;s stylized signs were considered &#x27;too psychedelic&#x27; – which to the then-government meant that they encouraged drug use. Despite Max&#x27;s objections to these accusations, the signs remained in storage until 1977, when the administration change brought a change in attitude. The signs remained in place until 1984, when they were replaced by &#x27;more conventional signage.&#x27;

===1980s–present===

In 1989, Max designed the cover photo—as well as the 45 rpm single picture-sleeve photo—of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Through the Storm&quot; album. In that same year, Max painted 40 colourful portraits of Mikhail Gorbachev to celebrate his policy of glasnost and efforts to democratize the Soviet Union. The work was entitled &quot;40 Gorbys.&quot;

In 1990, Max purchased a collection of Chevrolet Corvettes for an intended art project, but never used them. They were auctioned off in 2020–2021 and the profits were donated to benefit veterans.

Also in 1990, Max was awarded the rights to a massive section of the Berlin Wall, which was installed at the &quot;Intrepid Museum&quot;. He chiseled a dove out of the wall and placed it on top, as a symbol of freedom.

In 1994, Max designed the artwork for progressive rock band Yes&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Talk&quot;. In 2012, he was chosen to paint the hull art of the New York-themed ship &quot;Norwegian Breakaway&quot; by Norwegian Cruise Line.

Max has been the official artist for many major events, including the 1994 World Cup, the Grammy Awards, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Super Bowl and others. In 2000, Max designed the paint scheme Dale Earnhardt drove at the Winston all-star race, deviating from Earnhardt&#x27;s trademark black car. He was also the Official Artist of the 2000 World Series, the &quot;Subway Series&quot; between the New York Yankees and the New York Mets.

Max first painted Taylor Swift&#x27;s portrait as a gift to the singer for her Grammy-winning albums &quot;Fearless&quot; and &quot;Speak Now&quot;, and has recently painted new portraits of Taylor Swift to commemorate her worldwide success.

In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigative journalism piece on Max&#x27;s current state, revealing that he is suffering from advanced dementia, that he is now often unaware of his identity and his surroundings, and that his deteriorated mental state has been exploited in a massive art fraud scheme dating back to at least 2015.

==Work==
Max&#x27;s art work was first associated with the counter culture, neo-expressionism, neo-fauvism, and psychedelic movements in graphic design during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is known for using bursts of color, often containing much or all of the visible spectrum. In 1970, Max published his first book, &quot;Poster Book&quot;, containing a collection of his artworks in the form of posters, including a portrait of Toulouse Lautrec using his signature printing style, a poster for Apollo 11, and a portrait of Bob Dylan. The book was such a success that Max quickly released a follow-up in 1971 called &quot;Superposter Book&quot;. This edition contained posters from his commercial portfolio, posters about peace and love, and important images from his life and history. Max&#x27;s repeated claims, varying in detail, to have worked on &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; have been denied by the production team.

Max works in multiple media including painting, drawing, etchings (including aquatint), collage, print making, sculpture, video and digital imagery. He also includes &quot;mass media&quot; as being another &quot;canvas&quot; for his creative expression. He has collaborated with companies to create clothing, homewares, clocks, and other material goods.

Max often uses American icons and symbols in his artwork. He has created paintings of presidents Kennedy, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush in addition to his &quot;100 Clintons&quot;—a multiple portrait installation. Additional commissions have included the creation of the first &quot;Preserve the Environment&quot; postage stamp, in honor of the World&#x27;s Fair in Spokane, Washington; border murals at entry points to the United States from Canada and Mexico; and exhibitions in over 40 museums and 50 galleries worldwide. He often features images of celebrities, politicians, athletes and sporting events and other pop culture subjects in his artwork.

One of Continental Airlines&#x27; Boeing 777-200ER aircraft (registered N77014) sported a livery designed by Max. His artwork was featured on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot; where his &quot;44 Obamas,&quot; commemorating Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was debuted. In 2013, HarperCollins published a book of the artist&#x27;s memoirs and thoughts called &quot;The Universe of Peter Max&quot;. In it, he relates stories of his life as well as descriptions and thoughts surrounding of some of his artwork.

==Legal==
In 1997, Max was indicted by a grand jury in United States District Court for federal income tax evasion and pled guilty in the Southern District of New York before Senior United States District Judge, Kimba Wood of defrauding the Internal Revenue Service by having concealed $1,100,000 in income. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, “A Federal grand jury in Manhattan also indicted Mr. Max, 58, on charges that he bartered his paintings as part payment for homes in Woodstock, N.Y., and Southampton, L.I., and in St. John in the United States Virgin Islands. The indictment says he failed to declare the &quot;sale&quot; of those paintings on his income tax returns. After learning he was under criminal investigation in November 1990, the indictment charges, Mr. Max and his accountant, Rubin Gorewitz, 71, tried to conceal income from the I.R.S. by faking sales receipts for the art that had been traded for real estate.” In exchange for his plea bargain Max received a felony conviction and was sentenced to a term of two months of incarceration in a prison operated by Federal Bureau of Prisons overseen by the United States Department of Justice.

In 2019, the estate of Louis Gottlieb filed a civil lawsuit in New York Supreme Court against Peter Max, and the estate of Peter Max’s late wife, Mary Max. The suit alleged that Peter and Mary Max had embezzled $4,600,000 from the $11,000,000 Gottlieb trust while the trust’s grantor, Louis Gottlieb was suffering from dementia. The suit further alleged that Peter and Mary Max had squandered the ill-gotten gains on luxury goods. According to the New York Post, “They used much of the cash to splurge on bling, including a Cartier bracelet, earrings and a ring collectively worth $1.485 million; $1.3 million in jewelry from Bhagat; a Verdura ring costing $58,500; and $47,000 Van Cleef &amp; Arpels earrings, among dozens of other pricey purchases, according to Lou’s daughter, who is seeking to recoup the cash.” The Gottlieb estate sought to recover a portion of the alleged ill-gotten proceeds from Peter Max following Mary Max&#x27;s suicide when Peter Max attempted to liquidate the luxury goods at Doyle New York.

==Personal life==
Max married his first wife Elizabeth Ann Nance in 1963 and they divorced in 1976. Max had a nine-year-long relationship with musician and model Rosie Vela that ended in 1985. He was also romantically connected with Tina Louise. Max married Mary Balkin in 1997; she died by suicide (nitrogen asphyxiation) in June 2019.

Max is an environmentalist, vegan and supporter of human and animal rights. In 2002, Max contributed to rescue efforts for Cincinnati Freedom, a cow that escaped from an Ohio slaughterhouse. The cow jumped over a six-foot fence while the slaughterhouse workers were on break and eluded capture for eleven days. Max donated $180,000 worth of his art to benefit the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, part of a chain of events that finally led to the cow being sent to Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, New York, a permanent home where the cow remained for the rest of her life.

Max lives in New York City and has two adult children, Adam Cosmo Max and Libra Astro Max. Max has developed advanced dementia, largely the result of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There is controversy concerning the guardianship Max is presently under. For some years his daughter has worked to revise the guardianship.

<text>&#x27; (Latin for &#x27;Etymologies&#x27;), also known as the &#x27; (&#x27;Origins&#x27;), usually abbreviated Orig., is an etymological encyclopedia compiled by the influential Christian bishop Isidore of Seville () towards the end of his life. Isidore was encouraged to write the book by his friend Braulio, Bishop of Saragossa. summarized and organized a wealth of knowledge from hundreds of classical sources; three of its books are derived largely from Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;. Isidore acknowledges Pliny, but not his other principal sources, namely Cassiodorus, Servius, and Gaius Julius Solinus.

It was so popular that it was read in place of many of the original classics that it summarized; as a result, some of these ceased to be copied and were lost. It was cited by Dante Alighieri (who placed Isidore in his ), quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, and mentioned by the poets Boccaccio, Petrarch, and John Gower. Among the thousand-odd surviving manuscript copies is the 13th-century ; the earliest surviving manuscript, the , preserves books XI to XX from the 9th century. was printed in at least ten editions between 1472 and 1530, after which its importance faded during the Renaissance. The first scholarly edition was printed in Madrid in 1599; the first modern critical edition was edited by Wallace Lindsay in 1911.

While less well known in modern times, modern scholars recognize the work&#x27;s importance in preserving both classical texts, as well as insight into the medieval mindset.

== Background ==

Isidore of Seville was born around 560 in Cartagena, which was under the unstable rule of the Visigoths after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. His older brother, Leander, the abbot of a Seville monastery, supervised Isidore&#x27;s education, probably in the school attached to his monastery. Leander was a powerful priest, a friend of Pope Gregory, and eventually he became bishop of Seville. Leander also made friends with the Visigothic king&#x27;s sons, Hermenigild and Reccared. In 586, Reccared became king, and in 587 he converted to Catholicism under Leander&#x27;s religious direction, and consequently controlled the appointment of bishops. Reccared died in 601, not long after appointing Isidore as bishop of Seville.

Isidore helped to unify the kingdom through Christianity and education, eradicating the Arian heresy which had been widespread, and led National Councils at Toledo and Seville. Isidore had a close friendship with king Sisebut, who came to the throne in 612, and with another Seville churchman, Braulio, who later became bishop of Saragossa.

Isidore was widely read, mainly in Latin with a little Greek and Hebrew. He was familiar with the works of both the church fathers and pagan writers such as Martial, Cicero and Pliny the Elder, this last the author of the major encyclopaedia then in existence, the &quot;Natural History&quot;. The classical encyclopedists had already introduced alphabetic ordering of topics, and a literary rather than observational approach to knowledge: Isidore followed those traditions. Isidore became well known in his lifetime as a scholar. He started to put together the , a collection of his knowledge, in about 600, and continued to write until around 625.

== Overview ==


The presents an abbreviated form of much of that part of the learning of antiquity that Christians thought worth preserving. Etymologies, often very far-fetched, form the subject of just one of the encyclopedia&#x27;s twenty books (Book X), but perceived linguistic similarities permeate the work. An idea of the quality of Isidore&#x27;s etymological knowledge is given by Peter Jones: &quot;Now we know most of his derivations are total nonsense (eg, he derives , &#x27;walking-stick&#x27;, from Bacchus, god of drink, because you need one to walk straight after sinking a few)&quot;.

The work covers many of the subjects of ancient learning, from theology to the construction and provenance of furniture, and provides a rich source of classical lore and learning for medieval writers. Isidore quotes from around 475 works from over 200 authors in his works, including those outside the . Bishop Braulio, to whom Isidore dedicated it and sent it for correction, divided it into its twenty books.

An analysis of Book XII by Jacques André identifies 58 quotations from named authors and 293 borrowed but uncited usages: 79 from Solinus; 61 from Servius; 45 from Pliny the Elder. Isidore takes care to name classical and Christian scholars whose material he uses: in descending order of frequency, Aristotle (15 references), Jerome (10 times), Cato (9 times), Plato (8 times), Pliny, Donatus, Eusebius, Augustine, Suetonius, and Josephus. He mentions as prolific authors the pagan Varro and the Christians Origen and Augustine. But his translator Stephen Barney notes as remarkable that he never actually names the compilers of the encyclopedias that he used &quot;at second or third hand&quot;, Aulus Gellius, Nonius Marcellus, Lactantius, Macrobius, and Martianus Capella. Barney further notes as &quot;most striking&quot; that Isidore never mentions three out of his four principal sources (the one he does name being Pliny): Cassiodorus, Servius and Solinus. Conversely, he names Pythagoras eight times, even though Pythagoras wrote no books. The are thus &quot;complacently derivative&quot;.

In Book II, dealing with dialectic and rhetoric, Isidore is heavily indebted to translations from the Greek by Boethius; in Book III he is similarly in debt to Cassiodorus, who provided the gist of Isidore&#x27;s treatment of arithmetic. Caelius Aurelianus contributes generously to the part of Book IV dealing with medicine. Isidore&#x27;s view of Roman law in Book V is viewed through the lens of the Visigothic compendiary called the &quot;Breviary of Alaric&quot;, which was based on the Code of Theodosius, which Isidore never saw. Through Isidore&#x27;s condensed paraphrase a third-hand memory of Roman law passed to the Early Middle Ages. Lactantius is the author most extensively quoted in Book XI, concerning man. Books XII, XIII and XIV are largely based on the &quot;Natural History&quot; and Solinus, whereas the lost &quot;Prata&quot; of Suetonius, which can be partly pieced together from what is quoted in the , seems to have inspired the general plan of the work, as well as many of its details.

Isidore&#x27;s Latin, replete with nonstandard Vulgar Latin, stands at the cusp of Latin and the local Romance language emerging in Hispania. According to the prefatory letters, the work was composed at the urging of Braulio, to whom Isidore sent the unedited manuscript at the end of his life, which seems to have begun circulating before Braulio was able to revise and issue it with a dedication to the late Visigothic king Sisebut.

== Contents ==

&quot;The Etymologies&quot; organizes knowledge, mainly drawn from the classics, into twenty books:

In Book I, Isidore begins with a lengthy section on grammar, the first of three subjects in the mediaeval Trivium considered at the time the core of essential knowledge. He covers the letters of the alphabet, parts of speech, accents, punctuation and other marks, shorthand and abbreviations, writing in cipher and sign language, types of mistake and histories. He derives the word for letters () from the Latin words for &quot;to read&quot; () and &#x27;road&#x27; (), &quot;as if the term were &quot;, arguing that letters offer a road for people who read.

Book II completes the medieval Trivium with coverage of rhetoric and dialectic. Isidore describes what rhetoric is, kinds of argument, maxims, elocution, ways of speaking, and figures of speech. On dialectic, he discusses philosophy, syllogisms, and definitions. He equates the Greek term syllogism with the Latin term argumentation (), which he derives from the Latin for &quot;clear mind&quot; ().

Book III covers the medieval Quadrivium, the four subjects that supplemented the Trivium being arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. He argues that there are infinitely many numbers, as you can always add one (or any other number) to whatever number you think is the limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people&#x27;s land &quot;with lines and measures&quot;. Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology and covers the world, the sky and the celestial sphere, the zodiac, the Sun, Moon, stars, Milky Way, and planets, and the names of the stars. He derives the curved () vault of the heavens from the Latin word for &quot;upside-down&quot; (). He explains eclipses of the Sun as the Moon coming between the Earth and the Sun and eclipses of the Moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the Earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Isidore of Seiville distinguished between a &#x27;Superstitious&#x27; astrology () from a &#x27;natural&#x27; astrology. The first deals with the horoscope and the attempt of foreseeing the future of one or more persons; the latter was a legitimate activity which had concerns with meteorological predictions, including iatromathematics and astrological medicine.

Book IV covers medicine, including the four humours, diseases, remedies and medical instruments. He derives the word medicine from the Latin for &quot;moderation&quot; (), and &quot;sciatica&quot; () from the affected part of the body, the hip (Greek ).

Book V covers law and chronology. Isidore distinguishes natural, civil, international, military and public law among others. He discusses the purpose of law, legal cases, witnesses, offences and penalties. On chronology, Isidore covers periods of time such as days, weeks, and months, solstices and equinoxes, seasons, special years such as Olympiads and Jubilees, generations and ages.

In Book VI, Isidore describes ecclesiastical books and offices starting with the Old and New Testaments, the authors and names of the holy books, libraries and translators, authors, writing materials including tablets, papyrus and parchment, books, scribes, and Christian festivals.

Book VII describes the basic scheme concerning God, angels, and saints: in other words, the hierarchies of heaven and earth from patriarchs, prophets and apostles down the scale through people named in the gospels to martyrs, clergymen, monks and ordinary Christians.

Book VIII covers religion in the shape of the Christian church, the Jews and heretical sects, pagan philosophers including poets, sibyls and magi, and the pagan gods.

Book IX covers languages, peoples, kingdoms, cities and titles.

Book X is a word-list of nouns and adjectives, together with supposed etymologies for them. For example, the letter &#x27;D&#x27; begins with the word for master (), as he is the head of a household (); the adjective docile () is derived by Isidore from the verb for &quot;to teach&quot; (), because docile people are able to learn; and the word for abominable () is explained as being not worth the grain called spelt ().

Book XI covers human beings, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (&quot;homo&quot;) from the Latin for soil (&quot;humus&quot;), as in Genesis 2:7 it says that man is made from the soil. Urine (&quot;urina&quot;) gets its name either from the fact that it can burn (&quot;urere&quot;) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (&quot;renes&quot;). &quot;Femina&quot;, meaning woman, comes from &quot;femora/femina&quot; meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for buttocks is &quot;clunis&quot; as they are near the large intestine or colon (&quot;colum&quot;).

Book XII covers animals, including small animals, snakes, worms, fish, birds and other beasts that fly. Isidore&#x27;s treatment is as usual full of conjectural etymology, so a horse is called because when in a team of four horses they are balanced (&quot;aequare&quot;). The spider (&quot;aranea&quot;) is so called from the air (&quot;aer&quot;) that feeds it. The electric ray (&quot;torpedo&quot;) is called that because it numbs (, compare English &quot;torpid&quot;) anyone who touches it.

Book XIII describes the physical world, atoms, classical elements, the sky, clouds, thunder and lightning, rainbows, winds, and waters including the sea, the Mediterranean, bays, tides, lakes, rivers and floods. The sky is called , as it has stars stamped on to it, like a decorated pot (). Clouds are called as they veil () the sky, just as brides () wear veils for their weddings. The wind is called , as it is angry and violent (, ). There are many kinds of water: some water &quot;is salty, some alkaline, some with alum, some sulfuric, some tarry, and some containing a cure for illnesses.&quot; There are waters that cure eye injuries, or make voices melodious, or cause madness, or cure infertility. The water of the Styx causes immediate death.

Book XIV covers geography, describing the Earth, islands, promontories, mountains and caves. The Earth is divided into three parts, Asia occupying half the globe, and Europe and Africa each occupying a quarter. Europe is separated from Africa by the Mediterranean, reaching in from the Ocean that flows all around the land. Isidore writes that the of the Earth, translated by Barney as &quot;globe&quot;, &quot;derives its name from the roundness of the circle, because it resembles a wheel; hence a small wheel is called a &#x27;small disk&#x27; ()&quot;. Barney notes that &quot;orbis&quot; &quot;refers to the &#x27;circle&#x27; of lands around the Mediterranean, and hence to the total known extent of land.&quot; Isidore illustrated the &quot;Etymologies&quot; with a circular T-O map which also gave a vague impression of a flat disc-shaped Earth, though authors disagree about Isidore&#x27;s beliefs on the matter.

Book XV covers cities and buildings including public buildings, houses, storehouses and workshops, parts of buildings, tents, fields and roads.

Book XVI covers metals and rocks, starting with dust and earth, and moving on to gemstones of different colours, glass and mines. Metals include gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and electrum. Weights and measures end the book. Games with boards and dice are described.

Book XVII describes agriculture, including grains, legumes, vines, trees, aromatic herbs and vegetables.

Book XVIII covers the terms of war, games, and jurisprudence. Isidore describes standards, trumpets, weapons including swords, spears, arrows, slings, battering rams, and armour including shields, breastplates and helmets. Athletic games include running and jumping, throwing and wrestling. Circus games are described, with chariot racing, horse racing and vaulting. In the theatre, comedy, tragedy, mime and dance are covered. In the amphitheatre, Isidore covers those who fight with nets, nooses and other weapons.

Book XIX covers ships including boats, sails, ropes and nets; forges and tools; building, including walls, decorations, ceilings, mosaics, statues, and building tools; and clothes, including types of dress, cloaks, bedding, tools, rings, belts and shoes. The word &quot;net&quot; (), is derived from retaining () fish, or perhaps, writes Isidore, from the ropes () they are attached to.

Book XX completes Isidore&#x27;s encyclopaedia, describing food and drink and vessels for these, storage and cooking vessels; furnishings including beds and chairs; vehicles, farm and garden tools and equipment for horses.

== Reception ==

=== Middle Ages ===

Isidore was widely influential throughout the Middle Ages, feeding directly into word lists and encyclopaedias by Papias, Huguccio, Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Vincent of Beauvais, as well as being used everywhere in the form of small snippets. His influence also pertained to early medieval riddle collections such as the Bern Riddles or the of Aldhelm. He was cited by Dante Alighieri, quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, and his name was mentioned by the poets Boccaccio, Petrarch and John Gower among others. Dante went so far as to place Isidore in Paradise in the final part of his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, &quot;Paradiso&quot; (10.130–131).

Throughout the Middle Ages, the was the textbook most in use, regarded so highly as a repository of classical learning that, in a great measure, it superseded the use of the individual works of the classics themselves, full texts of which were no longer copied and thus were lost. It was one of the most popular compendia in medieval libraries.

=== Modern ===

&quot;An editor&#x27;s enthusiasm is soon chilled by the discovery that Isidore&#x27;s book is really a mosaic of pieces borrowed from previous writers, sacred and profane, often their &#x27;ipsa verba&#x27; without alteration,&quot; Wallace Lindsay noted in 1911, having recently edited Isidore for the Clarendon Press, with the further observation, however, that a portion of the texts quoted have otherwise been lost: the of Suetonius, for instance, can only be reconstructed from Isidore&#x27;s excerpts.

In the view of John T. Hamilton, writing in &quot;The Classical Tradition&quot; in 2010, &quot;Our knowledge of ancient and early medieval thought owes an enormous amount to this encyclopedia, a reflective catalogue of received wisdom, which the authors of the only complete translation into English introduce as &quot;arguably the most influential book, after the Bible, in the learned world of the Latin West for nearly a thousand years&quot; These days, of course, Isidore and his &quot;Etymologies&quot; are anything but household names... but the Vatican has named Isidore the patron saint of the Internet, which is likely to make his work slightly better known.

Ralph Hexter, also writing in &quot;The Classical Tradition&quot;, comments on &quot;Isidore&#x27;s largest and massively influential work... on which he was still at work at the time of his death... his own architecture for the whole is relatively clear (if somewhat arbitrary)... At the deepest level Isidore&#x27;s encyclopedia is rooted in the dream that language can capture the universe and that if we but parse it correctly, it can lead us to the proper understanding of God&#x27;s creation. His word derivations are not based on principles of historical linguistics but follow their own logic... Isidore is the master of bricolage... His reductions and compilations did indeed transmit ancient learning, but Isidore, who often relied on scholia and earlier compilations, is often simplistic scientifically and philosophically, especially compared to .. figures such as Ambrose and Augustine.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Peter Jones compares to the Internet:

== Manuscripts and printed editions ==

Almost 1000 manuscript copies of have survived. The earliest is held at the Abbey library of Saint Gall in Switzerland, a 9th-century copy of Books XI to XX forming part of the . The 13th-century held in the National Library of Sweden, the largest extant medieval manuscript, contains a copy of the .

In 1472 at Augsburg, the became one of the first books to be printed, quickly followed by ten more editions by 1500. Juan de Grial produced the first scholarly edition in Madrid in 1599. Faustino Arevalo included it as two of the 17 volumes of his in Rome (1797–1803). Rudolph Beer produced a facsimile edition of the Toledo manuscript of the in 1909. Wallace Lindsay edited the first modern critical edition in 1911. Jacques Fontaine and Manuel C. Diaz y Diaz have between 1981 and 1995 supervised the production of the first five volumes of the in the Belle Lettres series &quot;Auteurs Latins du Moyen Age&quot;, with extensive footnotes.
