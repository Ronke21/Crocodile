<text>Rudolf Ludwig Carl Virchow ( ; ; 13 October 18215 September 1902) was a German physician, anthropologist, pathologist, prehistorian, biologist, writer, editor, and politician. He is known as &quot;the father of modern pathology&quot; and as the founder of social medicine, and to his colleagues, the &quot;Pope of medicine&quot;.

Virchow studied medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University under Johannes Peter Müller. While working at the Charité hospital, his investigation of the 1847–1848 typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia laid the foundation for public health in Germany, and paved his political and social careers. From it, he coined a well known aphorism: &quot;Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale&quot;. His participation in the Revolution of 1848 led to his expulsion from Charité the next year. He then published a newspaper &quot;Die Medizinische Reform&quot; (&quot;The Medical Reform&quot;). He took the first Chair of Pathological Anatomy at the University of Würzburg in 1849. After seven years, in 1856, Charité reinstated him to its new Institute for Pathology. He co-founded the political party Deutsche Fortschrittspartei, and was elected to the Prussian House of Representatives and won a seat in the Reichstag. His opposition to Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s financial policy resulted in duel challenge by the latter. However, Virchow supported Bismarck in his anti-Catholic campaigns, which he named &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;culture struggle&quot;).

A prolific writer, he produced more than 2000 scientific writings. &quot;Cellular Pathology&quot; (1858), regarded as the root of modern pathology, introduced the third dictum in cell theory: &quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot; (&quot;All cells come from cells&quot;), although this concept is now widely recognized as being plagiarized from Robert Remak. He was a co-founder of &quot;Physikalisch-Medizinische Gesellschaft&quot; in 1849 and &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pathologie&quot; in 1897. He founded journals such as &quot;Archiv für Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für Klinische Medicin&quot; (with Benno Reinhardt in 1847, later renamed &quot;Virchows Archiv&quot;), and &quot;Zeitschrift für Ethnologie&quot; (&quot;Journal of Ethnology&quot;). The latter is published by German Anthropological Association and the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory, the societies which he also founded.

Virchow was the first to describe and name diseases such as leukemia, chordoma, ochronosis, embolism, and thrombosis. He coined biological terms such as &quot;neuroglia&quot;, &quot;agenesis&quot;, &quot;parenchyma&quot;, &quot;osteoid&quot;, &quot;amyloid degeneration&quot;, and &quot;spina bifida&quot;; terms such as Virchow&#x27;s node, Virchow–Robin spaces, Virchow–Seckel syndrome, and Virchow&#x27;s triad are named after him. His description of the life cycle of a roundworm &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot; influenced the practice of meat inspection. He developed the first systematic method of autopsy, and introduced hair analysis in forensic investigation. Opposing the germ theory of diseases, he rejected Ignaz Semmelweis&#x27;s idea of disinfecting. He was critical of what he described as &quot;Nordic mysticism&quot; regarding the Aryan race. As an anti-Darwinist, he called Charles Darwin an &quot;ignoramus&quot; and his own student Ernst Haeckel a &quot;fool&quot;. He described the original specimen of Neanderthal man as nothing but that of a deformed human.

== Early life ==

Virchow was born in Schievelbein, in eastern Pomerania, Prussia (now Świdwin, Poland). He was the only child of Carl Christian Siegfried Virchow (1785–1865) and Johanna Maria &quot;née&quot; Hesse (1785–1857). His father was a farmer and the city treasurer. Academically brilliant, he always topped his classes and was fluent in German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, English, Arabic, French, Italian and Dutch. He progressed to the gymnasium in Köslin (now Koszalin in Poland) in 1835 with the goal of becoming a pastor. He graduated in 1839 with a thesis titled &quot;A Life Full of Work and Toil is not a Burden but a Benediction&quot;. However, he chose medicine mainly because he considered his voice too weak for preaching.

==Scientific career==

In 1839, he received a military fellowship, a scholarship for gifted children from poor families to become army surgeons, to study medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (now Humboldt University of Berlin). He was most influenced by Johannes Peter Müller, his doctoral advisor. Virchow defended his doctoral thesis titled &quot;De rheumate praesertim corneae&quot; (corneal manifestations of rheumatic disease) on 21 October 1843. Immediately on graduation, he became subordinate physician to Müller. But shortly after, he joined the Charité Hospital in Berlin for internship. In 1844, he was appointed as medical assistant to the prosector (pathologist) Robert Froriep, from whom he learned microscopy which interested him in pathology. Froriep was also the editor of an abstract journal that specialised in foreign work, which inspired Virchow for scientific ideas of France and England.

Virchow published his first scientific paper in 1845, giving the earliest known pathological descriptions of leukemia. He passed the medical licensure examination in 1846 and immediately succeeded Froriep as hospital prosector at the Charité. In 1847, he was appointed to his first academic position with the rank of &quot;privatdozent&quot;. Because his articles did not receive favourable attention from German editors, he founded &quot;Archiv für Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für Klinische Medicin&quot; (now known as &quot;Virchows Archiv&quot;) with a colleague Benno Reinhardt in 1847. He edited alone after Reinhardt&#x27;s death in 1852 till his own. This journal published critical articles based on the criterion that no papers would be published that contained outdated, untested, dogmatic or speculative ideas.

Unlike his German peers, Virchow had great faith in clinical observation, animal experimentation (to determine causes of diseases and the effects of drugs) and pathological anatomy, particularly at the microscopic level, as the basic principles of investigation in medical sciences. He went further and stated that the cell was the basic unit of the body that had to be studied to understand disease. Although the term &#x27;cell&#x27; had been coined in 1665 during the English scientist Robert Hooke&#x27;s early application of the microscope to biology, the building blocks of life were still considered to be the 21 tissues of Bichat, a concept described by the French physician Xavier Bichat.

The Prussian government employed Virchow to study the typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia in 1847–1848. It was from this medical campaign that he developed his ideas on social medicine and politics after seeing the victims and their poverty. Even though he was not particularly successful in combating the epidemic, his 190-paged &quot;Report on the Typhus Epidemic in Upper Silesia&quot; in 1848 became a turning point in politics and public health in Germany. He returned to Berlin on 10 March 1848, and only eight days later, a revolution broke out against the government in which he played an active part. To fight political injustice he helped found &quot;Die Medizinische Reform (Medical Reform)&quot;, a weekly newspaper for promoting social medicine, in July of that year. The newspaper ran under the banners &quot;medicine is a social science&quot; and &quot;the physician is the natural attorney of the poor&quot;. Political pressures forced him to terminate the publication in June 1849, and he was expelled from his official position.

In November 1848, he was given an academic appointment and left Berlin for the University of Würzburg to hold Germany&#x27;s first chair of pathological anatomy. During his seven-year period there, he concentrated on his scientific work, including detailed studies of venous thrombosis and cellular theory. His first major work there was a six-volume &quot;Handbuch der speciellen Pathologie und Therapie (Handbook on Special Pathology and Therapeutics)&quot; published in 1854. In 1856, he returned to Berlin to become the newly created Chair for Pathological Anatomy and Physiology at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University, as well as Director of the newly built Institute for Pathology on the premises of the Charité. He held the latter post for the next 20 years.

===Cell biology===
Virchow is credited with several key discoveries. His most widely known scientific contribution is his cell theory, which built on the work of Theodor Schwann. He was one of the first to accept the work of Robert Remak, who showed that the origin of cells was the division of pre-existing cells. He did not initially accept the evidence for cell division and believed that it occurs only in certain types of cells. When it dawned on him in 1855 that Remak might be right, he published Remak&#x27;s work as his own, causing a falling-out between the two.

Virchow was particularly influenced in cellular theory by the work of John Goodsir of Edinburgh, whom he described as &quot;one of the earliest and most acute observers of cell-life both physiological and pathological&quot;. Virchow dedicated his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Die Cellularpathologie&quot; to Goodsir. Virchow&#x27;s cellular theory was encapsulated in the epigram &quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot; (&quot;all cells (come) from cells&quot;), which he published in 1855. (The epigram was actually coined by François-Vincent Raspail, but popularized by Virchow.) It is a rejection of the concept of spontaneous generation, which held that organisms could arise from nonliving matter. For example, maggots were believed to appear spontaneously in decaying meat; Francesco Redi carried out experiments that disproved this notion and coined the maxim &quot;Omne vivum ex ovo&quot; (&quot;Every living thing comes from a living thing&quot; — literally &quot;from an egg&quot;); Virchow (and his predecessors) extended this to state that the only source for a living cell was another living cell.

===Cancer===

In 1845, Virchow and John Hughes Bennett independently observed abnormal increases in white blood cells in some patients. Virchow correctly identified the condition as a blood disease, and named it &quot;leukämie&quot; in 1847 (later anglicised to leukemia). In 1857, he was the first to describe a type of tumour called chordoma that originated from the clivus (at the base of the skull).

===Theory of cancer origin===

Virchow was the first to correctly link the origin of cancers from otherwise normal cells. (His teacher Müller had proposed that cancers originated from cells, but from special cells, which he called blastema.) In 1855, he suggested that cancers arise from the activation of dormant cells (perhaps similar to cells now known as stem cells) present in mature tissue. Virchow believed that cancer is caused by severe irritation in the tissues, and his theory came to be known as chronic irritation theory. He thought, rather wrongly, that the irritation spread in the form of liquid so that cancer rapidly increases. His theory was largely ignored, as he was proved wrong that it was not by liquid, but by metastasis of the already cancerous cells that cancers spread. (Metastasis was first described by Karl Thiersch in the 1860s.)

He made a crucial observation that certain cancers (carcinoma in the modern sense) were inherently associated with white blood cells (which are now called macrophages) that produced irritation (inflammation). It was only towards the end of the 20th century that Virchow&#x27;s theory was taken seriously. It was realised that specific cancers (including those of mesothelioma, lung, prostate, bladder, pancreatic, cervical, esophageal, melanoma, and head and neck) are indeed strongly associated with long-term inflammation. In addition it became clear that prolonged use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, reduced cancer risk. Experiments also show that drugs that block inflammation simultaneously inhibit tumour formation and development.

====The Kaiser&#x27;s case====

Virchow was one of the leading physicians to Kaiser Frederick III, who suffered from cancer of the larynx. While other physicians such as Ernst von Bergmann suggested surgical removal of the entire larynx, Virchow was opposed to it because no successful operation of this kind had ever been done. The British surgeon Morell Mackenzie performed a biopsy of the Kaiser in 1887 and sent it to Virchow, who identified it as &quot;pachydermia verrucosa laryngis&quot;. Virchow affirmed that the tissues were not cancerous, even after several biopsy tests.

The Kaiser died on 15 June 1888. The next day a post-mortem examination was performed by Virchow and his assistant. They found that the larynx was extensively damaged by ulceration, and microscopic examination confirmed epidermal carcinoma. &quot;Die Krankheit Kaiser Friedrich des Dritten (The Medical Report of Kaiser Frederick III)&quot; was published on 11 July under the lead authorship of Bergmann. But Virchow and Mackenzie were omitted, and they were particularly criticised for all their works. The arguments between them turned into a century-long controversy, resulting in Virchow being accused of misdiagnosis and malpractice. But reassessment of the diagnostic history revealed that Virchow was right in his findings and decisions. It is now believed that the Kaiser had hybrid verrucous carcinoma, a very rare form of verrucous carcinoma, and that Virchow had no way of correctly identifying it. (The cancer type was correctly identified only in 1948 by Lauren Ackerman.)

===Inflammation===
Virchow analysed the four key symptoms of inflammation (redness, swelling, heat and pain) and postulated that inflammation includes several inflammatory processes. He introduced the idea of a fifth symptom, functio laesa, the loss of function of inflamed tissues.

===Anatomy===
It was discovered approximately simultaneously by Virchow and Charles Emile Troisier that an enlarged left supraclavicular node is one of the earliest signs of gastrointestinal malignancy, commonly of the stomach, or less commonly, lung cancer. This sign has become known as Virchow&#x27;s node and simultaneously Troisier&#x27;s sign.

===Thromboembolism===
Virchow is also known for elucidating the mechanism of pulmonary thromboembolism (a condition of blood clotting in the blood vessels), coining the terms embolism and thrombosis. He noted that blood clots in the pulmonary artery originate first from venous thrombi, stating in 1859: [T]he detachment of larger or smaller fragments from the end of the softening thrombus which are carried along by the current of blood and driven into remote vessels. This gives rise to the very frequent process on which I have bestowed the name of Embolia.&quot; Having made these initial discoveries based on autopsies, he proceeded to put forward a scientific hypothesis; that pulmonary thrombi are transported from the veins of the leg and that the blood has the ability to carry such an object. He then proceeded to prove this hypothesis by well-designed experiments, repeated numerous times to consolidate evidence, and with meticulously detailed methodology. This work rebutted a claim made by the eminent French pathologist Jean Cruveilhier that phlebitis led to clot development and that thus coagulation was the main consequence of venous inflammation. This was a view held by many before Virchow&#x27;s work. Related to this research, Virchow described the factors contributing to venous thrombosis, Virchow&#x27;s triad.

===Pathology===
Virchow founded the medical fields of cellular pathology and comparative pathology (comparison of diseases common to humans and animals). His most important work in the field was &quot;Cellular Pathology&quot; (&quot;Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer Begründung auf physiologische und pathologische Gewebelehre&quot;) published in 1858, as a collection of his lectures. This is regarded as the basis of modern medical science, and the &quot;greatest advance which scientific medicine had made since its beginning.&quot;

His very innovative work may be viewed as between that of Giovanni Battista Morgagni, whose work Virchow studied, and that of Paul Ehrlich, who studied at the Charité while Virchow was developing microscopic pathology there. One of Virchow&#x27;s major contributions to German medical education was to encourage the use of microscopes by medical students, and he was known for constantly urging his students to &quot;think microscopically&quot;. He was the first to establish a link between infectious diseases between humans and animals, for which he coined the term &quot;zoonoses&quot;. He also introduced scientific terms such as &quot;chromatin&quot;, &quot;agenesis&quot;, &quot;parenchyma&quot;, &quot;osteoid&quot;, &quot;amyloid degeneration&quot;, and &quot;spina bifida&quot;. His concepts on pathology directly opposed humourism, an ancient medical dogma that diseases were due to imbalanced body fluids, hypothetically called humours, that still pervaded.

Virchow was a great influence on Swedish pathologist Axel Key, who worked as his assistant during Key&#x27;s doctoral studies in Berlin.

====Parasitology====
Virchow worked out the life cycle of a roundworm &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;. Virchow noticed a mass of circular white flecks in the muscle of dog and human cadavers, similar to those described by Richard Owen in 1835. He confirmed by microscopic observation that the white particles were indeed the larvae of roundworms, curled up in the muscle tissue. Rudolph Leukart found that these tiny worms could develop into adult roundworms in the intestine of a dog. He correctly asserted that these worms could also cause human helminthiasis. Virchow further demonstrated that if the infected meat is first heated to 137 °F for 10 minutes, the worms could not infect dogs or humans. He established that human roundworm infection occurs via contaminated pork. This directly led to the establishment of meat inspection, which was first adopted in Berlin.

===Autopsy===
Virchow was the first to develop a systematic method of autopsy, based on his knowledge of cellular pathology. The modern autopsy still constitutes his techniques. His first significant autopsy was on a 50-year-old woman in 1845. He found an unusual number of white blood cells, and gave a detailed description in 1847 and named the condition as &quot;leukämie&quot;. One on his autopsies in 1857 was the first description of vertebral disc rupture. His autopsy on a baby in 1856 was the first description of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (the name given by K. M. Laurence a century later), a rare and fatal disease of the lung. From his experience of post-mortem examinations of cadavers, he published his method in a small book in 1876. His book was the first to describe the techniques of autopsy specifically to examine abnormalities in organs, and retain important tissues for further examination and demonstration. Unlike any other earlier practitioner, he practiced complete surgery of all body parts with body organs dissected one by one. This has become the standard method.

====Ochronosis====

Virchow discovered the clinical syndrome which he called ochronosis, a metabolic disorder in which a patient accumulates homogentisic acid in connective tissues and which can be identified by discolouration seen under the microscope. He found the unusual symptom in an autopsy of the corpse of a 67-year-old man on 8 May 1884. This was the first time this abnormal disease affecting cartilage and connective tissue was observed and characterised. His description and coining of the name appeared in the October 1866 issue of &quot;Virchows Archiv&quot;.

===Forensic work===

Virchow was the first to analyse hair in criminal investigation, and made the first forensic report on it in 1861. He was called as an expert witness in a murder case, and he used hair samples collected from the victim. He became the first to recognise the limitation of hair as evidence. He found that hairs can be different in an individual, that individual hair has characteristic features, and that hairs from different individuals can be strikingly similar. He concluded that evidence based on hair analysis is inconclusive. His testimony runs:
===Anthropology and prehistory biology===
Virchow developed an interest in anthropology in 1865, when he discovered pile dwellings in northern Germany. In 1869, he co-founded the German Anthropological Association. In 1870 he founded the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (&quot;Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte&quot;) which was very influential in coordinating and intensifying German archaeological research. Until his death, Virchow was several times (at least fifteen times) its president, often taking turns with his former student Adolf Bastian. As president, Virchow frequently contributed to and co-edited the society&#x27;s main journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Ethnologie&quot; (&quot;Journal of Ethnology&quot;), which Adolf Bastian, together with another student of Virchow, Robert Hartman, had founded in 1869.

In 1870, he led a major excavation of the hill forts in Pomerania. He also excavated wall mounds in Wöllstein in 1875 with Robert Koch, whose paper he edited on the subject. For his contributions in German archaeology, the Rudolf Virchow lecture is held annually in his honour. He made field trips to Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Egypt, Nubia, and other places, sometimes in the company of Heinrich Schliemann. His 1879 journey to the site of Troy is described in &quot;Beiträge zur Landeskunde in Troas&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the knowledge of the landscape in Troy&quot;, 1879) and &quot;Alttrojanische Gräber und Schädel&quot; (&quot;Old Trojan graves and skulls&quot;, 1882).

==== Anti-Darwinism ====
Virchow was an opponent of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, and particularly skeptical of the emergent thesis of human evolution. He did not reject evolutionary theory as a whole, and viewed the theory of natural selection as &quot;an immeasurable advance&quot; but that still has no &quot;actual proof&quot;. On 22 September 1877, he delivered a public address entitled &quot;The Freedom of Science in the Modern State&quot; before the Congress of German Naturalists and Physicians in Munich. There he spoke against the teaching of the theory of evolution in schools, arguing that it was as yet an unproven hypothesis that lacked empirical foundations and that, therefore, its teaching would negatively affect scientific studies. Ernst Haeckel, who had been Virchow&#x27;s student, later reported that his former professor said that &quot;it is quite certain that man did not descend from the apes...not caring in the least that now almost all experts of good judgment hold the opposite conviction.&quot;

Virchow became one of the leading opponents on the debate over the authenticity of Neanderthal, discovered in 1856, as distinct species and ancestral to modern humans. He himself examined the original fossil in 1872, and presented his observations before the Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte. He stated that the Neanderthal had not been a primitive form of human, but an abnormal human being, who, judging by the shape of his skull, had been injured and deformed, and considering the unusual shape of his bones, had been arthritic, rickety, and feeble. With such an authority, the fossil was rejected as new species. With this reasoning, Virchow &quot;judged Darwin an ignoramus and Haeckel a fool and was loud and frequent in the publication of these judgments,&quot; and declared that &quot;it is quite certain that man did not descend from the apes.&quot; The Neanderthals were later accepted as distinct species of humans, &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;.

On 22 September 1877, at the Fiftieth Conference of the German Association of Naturalists and Physician held in Munich, Haeckel pleaded for introducing evolution in the public school curricula, and tried to dissociate Darwinism from social Darwinism. His campaign was because of Herman Müller, a school teacher who was banned because of his teaching a year earlier on the inanimate origin of life from carbon. This resulted in prolonged public debate with Virchow. A few days later Virchow responded that Darwinism was only a hypothesis, and morally dangerous to students. This severe criticism of Darwinism was immediately taken up by the London &quot;Times&quot;, from which further debates erupted among English scholars. Haeckel wrote his arguments in the October issue of &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;The Present Position of Evolution Theory&quot;, to which Virchow responded in the next issue with an article &quot;The Liberty of Science in the Modern State&quot;. Virchow stated that teaching of evolution was &quot;contrary to the conscience of the natural scientists, who reckons only with facts.&quot; The debate led Haeckel to write a full book &quot;Freedom in Science and Teaching&quot; in 1879. That year the issue was discussed in the Prussian House of Representatives and the verdict was in favour of Virchow. In 1882 the Prussian education policy officially excluded natural history in schools.

Years later, the noted German physician Carl Ludwig Schleich would recall a conversation he held with Virchow, who was a close friend of his: &quot;...On to the subject of Darwinism. &#x27;I don&#x27;t believe in all this,&#x27; Virchow told me. &#x27;if I lie on my sofa and blow the possibilities away from me, as another man may blow the smoke of his cigar, I can, of course, sympathize with such dreams. But they don&#x27;t stand the test of knowledge. Haeckel is a fool. That will be apparent one day. As far as that goes, if anything like transmutation did occur it could only happen in the course of pathological degeneration!&#x27;&quot;

Virchow&#x27;s ultimate opinion about evolution was reported a year before he died; in his own words:
Virchow&#x27;s anti-evolutionism, like that of Albert von Kölliker and Thomas Brown, did not come from religion, since he was not a believer.

====Anti-racism====

Virchow believed that Haeckel&#x27;s monist propagation of social Darwinism was in its nature politically dangerous and anti-democratic, and he also criticized it because he saw it as related to the emergent nationalist movement in Germany, ideas about cultural superiority, and militarism. In 1885, he launched a study of craniometry, which gave results contradictory to contemporary scientific racist theories on the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, leading him to denounce the &quot;Nordic mysticism&quot; at the 1885 Anthropology Congress in Karlsruhe. Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated at the same congress that the people of Europe, be they German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a &quot;mixture of various races&quot;, further declaring that the &quot;results of craniology&quot; led to a &quot;struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race&quot; over others. He analysed the hair, skin, and eye colour of 6,758,827 schoolchildren to identify the Jews and Aryans. His findings, published in 1886 and concluding that there could be neither a Jewish nor a German race, were regarded as a blow to anti-Semitism and the existence of an &quot;Aryan race&quot;.

=== Anti-germ theory of diseases ===

Virchow did not believe in the germ theory of diseases, as advocated by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. He proposed that diseases came from abnormal activities inside the cells, not from outside pathogens. He believed that epidemics were social in origin, and the way to combat epidemics was political, not medical. He regarded germ theory as a hindrance to prevention and cure. He considered social factors such as poverty major causes of disease. He even attacked Koch&#x27;s and Ignaz Semmelweis&#x27; policy of handwashing as an antiseptic practice, who said of him: &quot;Explorers of nature recognize no bugbears other than individuals who speculate.&quot; He postulated that germs were only using infected organs as habitats, but were not the cause, and stated, &quot;If I could live my life over again, I would devote it to proving that germs seek their natural habitat: diseased tissue, rather than being the cause of diseased tissue&quot;.

==Politics and social medicine==

More than a laboratory physician, Virchow was an impassioned advocate for social and political reform. His ideology involved social inequality as the cause of diseases that requires political actions, stating:

Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale. Medicine, as a social science, as the science of human beings, has the obligation to point out problems and to attempt their theoretical solution: the politician, the practical anthropologist, must find the means for their actual solution... Science for its own sake usually means nothing more than science for the sake of the people who happen to be pursuing it. Knowledge which is unable to support action is not genuine – and how unsure is activity without understanding... If medicine is to fulfill her great task, then she must enter the political and social life... The physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor, and the social problems should largely be solved by them. 

Virchow actively worked for social change to fight poverty and diseases. His methods involved pathological observations and statistical analyses. He called this new field of social medicine a &quot;social science&quot;. His most important influences could be noted in Latin America, where his disciples introduced his social medicine. For example, his student Max Westenhöfer became Director of Pathology at the medical school of the University of Chile, becoming the most influential advocate. One of Westenhöfer&#x27;s students, Salvador Allende, through social and political activities based on Virchow&#x27;s doctrine, became the 29th President of Chile (1970–1973).

Virchow made himself known as a pronounced pro-democracy progressive in the year of revolutions in Germany (1848). His political views are evident in his &quot;Report on the Typhus Outbreak of Upper Silesia&quot;, where he states that the outbreak could not be solved by treating individual patients with drugs or with minor changes in food, housing, or clothing laws, but only through radical action to promote the advancement of an entire population, which could be achieved only by &quot;full and unlimited democracy&quot; and &quot;education, freedom and prosperity&quot;.

These radical statements and his minor part in the revolution caused the government to remove him from his position in 1849, although within a year he was reinstated as prosector &quot;on probation&quot;. Prosector was a secondary position in the hospital. This secondary position in Berlin convinced him to accept the chair of pathological anatomy at the medical school in the provincial town of Würzburg, where he continued his scientific research. Six years later, he had attained fame in scientific and medical circles, and was reinstated at Charité Hospital.

In 1859, he became a member of the Municipal Council of Berlin and began his career as a civic reformer. Elected to the Prussian Diet in 1862, he became leader of the Radical or Progressive party; and from 1880 to 1893, he was a member of the Reichstag. He worked to improve healthcare conditions for Berlin citizens, especially by working towards modern water and sewer systems. Virchow is credited as a founder of anthropology and of social medicine, frequently focusing on the fact that disease is never purely biological, but often socially derived or spread.

===The duel challenge by Bismarck===

As a co-founder and member of the liberal party &quot;Deutsche Fortschrittspartei&quot;, he was a leading political antagonist of Bismarck. He was opposed to Bismarck&#x27;s excessive military budget, which angered Bismarck sufficiently that he challenged Virchow to a duel in 1865. Virchow declined because he considered dueling an uncivilized way to solve a conflict. Various English-language sources purport a different version of events, the so-called &quot;Sausage Duel&quot;. It has Virchow, being the one challenged and therefore entitled to choose the weapons, selecting two pork sausages, one loaded with &quot;Trichinella&quot; larvae, the other safe; Bismarck declined. However, there are no German-language documents confirming this version.

===&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;===
Virchow supported Bismarck in an attempt to reduce the political and social influence of the Catholic Church, between 1871 and 1887. He remarked that the movement was acquiring &quot;the character of a great struggle in the interest of humanity&quot;. He called it &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;culture struggle&quot;) during the discussion of Adalbert Falk&#x27;s May Laws (&quot;Maigesetze&quot;). Virchow was respected in Masonic circles, and according to one source may have been a freemason, though no official record of this has been found.

==Personal life==

On 24 August 1850 in Berlin, Virchow married Ferdinande Rosalie Mayer (29 February 183221 February 1913), a liberal&#x27;s daughter. They had three sons and three daughters:
* Karl Virchow (1 August 185121 September 1912), a chemist
* (10 September 18527 April 1940), an anatomist
* Adele Virchow (1 October 185518 May 1955), the wife of Rudolf Henning, a professor of German studies
* Ernst Virchow (24 January 18585 April 1942)
* Marie Virchow (29 June 186623 October 1951), the editor of &quot;Rudolf Virchow, Briefe an Seine Eltern, 1839 bis 1864&quot; (published in 1906) and the wife of Carl Rabl, an Austrian anatomist
* Hanna Elisabeth Maria Virchow (10 May 187328 November 1963)

===Death===

Virchow broke his thigh bone on 4 January 1902, jumping off a running streetcar while exiting the electric tramway. Although he anticipated full recovery, the fractured femur never healed, and restricted his physical activity. His health gradually deteriorated and he died of heart failure after eight months, on 5 September 1902, in Berlin, a month before his 81st birthday. A state funeral was held on 9 September in the Assembly Room of the Magistracy in the Berlin Town Hall, which was decorated with laurels, palms and flowers. He was buried in the Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof in Schöneberg, Berlin. His tomb was shared by his wife on 21 February 1913.

==Collections and Foundations==
Rudolf Virchow was also a collector. Several museums in Berlin emerged from Virchow&#x27;s collections: the Märkisches Museum, the Museum of Prehistory and Early History, the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Medical History. In addition, Virchow&#x27;s collection of anatomical specimens from numerous European and non-European populations, which still exists today, deserves special mention. The collection is owned by the Berlin Society for Anthropology and Prehistory.
The collection hit the international headlines in 2020 when the two journalists Markus Grill and David Bruser, in cooperation with the archivist Nils Seethaler, succeeded in identifying four skulls of indigenous Canadians that were thought to be lost and which came into Virchow&#x27;s possession through the mediation of the Canadian doctor William Osler in the late 19th century.

<text>Bjarni Herjólfsson ( 10th century) was a Norse-Icelandic explorer who is believed to be the first known European discoverer of the mainland of the Americas, which he sighted in 986.

==Life==

Bjarni was born to Herjólfr, son of Bárdi Herjólfsson (), and Thorgerdr () in Iceland. In adulthood, Bjarni became a merchant captain, based in Norway, but visiting his father every summer in Greenland.

===Discovery of America===

Bjarni is believed to have been the first European to see North America. The &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot; (&quot;Greenlanders Saga&quot;) tells that one year he sailed to Iceland to visit his parents as usual, only to find that his father had gone with Erik the Red to Greenland. So he took his crew and set off to find him. But in that summer of 986, Bjarni, who had no map or compass, was blown off course by a storm. He saw a piece of land that was not Greenland. It was covered with trees and mountains and although his crew begged him to, he refused to stop and look around. Since no one in his crew had been to Greenland before, they had to search for it. Although he managed to regain his course, he reported seeing low-lying hills covered with forests some distance farther to the west. The land looked hospitable, but Bjarni was eager to reach Greenland to see his parents and did not land and explore the new lands. Eventually arriving in Greenland, he decided to settle with his father in Herjolfsnes. He reported his findings in Greenland but no one showed much interest in them until Bjarni returned to Norway after his father&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
After his voyage, word spread of the lands to the west he had seen, creating great intrigue throughout the Nordic Empire. Bjarni was both celebrated for his discoveries and chided—famously by Earl Eric—for his lack of investigation. Professor Tryggvi J. Oleson of the University of Manitoba stated &quot;There are strong arguments for the view that the three lands seen by Bjarni were Newfoundland, Labrador, and Baffin Island.&quot;

Greenlanders took special interest in his discoveries, and, as they lacked timber, became allured by the wooded coastline Bjarni reported sighting. Soon afterwards, Leif Erikson (Old Norse: &quot;Leifr Eiríksson&quot;), the son of Greenland leader Erik the Red, bought the ship that Bjarni had used for the voyage, hired a crew of 35 people, and set out to retrace Bjarni&#x27;s journey. The result is thought to be the Viking settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. This is the first known attempt at settlement by Europeans on the Americas.

==In fiction==
The main character, also named Bjarni, in the &quot;&quot; video game series is based on Herjólfsson.

The main character, Barney Hendrickson, of &quot;The Technicolor Time Machine&quot; realizes that he is Bjarni, his name having undergone some alterations to become more typical Norse over the generations.

<doc id="140757" wikidata="Q311187" url="?curid=140757" title="Francesco Redi">
<text>Francesco Redi (18 February 1626 – 1 March 1697) was an Italian physician, naturalist, biologist, and poet. He is referred to as the &quot;founder of experimental biology&quot;, and as the &quot;father of modern parasitology&quot;. He was the first person to challenge the theory of spontaneous generation by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies.

Having a doctoral degree in both medicine and philosophy from the University of Pisa at the age of 21, he worked in various cities of Italy. A rationalist of his time, he was a critic of verifiable myths, such as spontaneous generation. His most famous experiments are described in his magnum opus &quot;Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl&#x27;insetti&quot; (&quot;Experiments on the Generation of Insects&quot;), published in 1668. He disproved that vipers drink wine and could break glasses and that their venom was poisonous when ingested. He correctly observed that snake venoms were produced from the fangs, not the gallbladder, as was believed. He was also the first to recognize and correctly describe details of about 180 parasites, including &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot; and &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;. He also distinguished earthworms from helminths (like tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms). He possibly originated the use of the control, the basis of experimental design in modern biology. A collection of his poems first published in 1685 &quot;Bacco in Toscana&quot; (&quot;Bacchus in Tuscany&quot;) is considered among the finest works of 17th-century Italian poetry, and for which the Grand Duke Cosimo III gave him a medal of honour.

==Biography==

The son of Gregorio Redi and Cecilia de Ghinci, Francesco Redi was born in Arezzo on 18 February 1626. His father was a renowned physician at Florence. After schooling with the Jesuits, Francesco Redi attended the University of Pisa from where he obtained his doctoral degrees in medicine and philosophy in 1647, at the age of 21. He constantly moved, to Rome, Naples, Bologna, Padua, and Venice, and finally settled in Florence in 1648. Here he was registered at the &quot;Collegio Medico&quot; where he served at the Medici Court as both the head physician and superintendent of the ducal apothecary to Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his successor, Cosimo III. It is here that most of his academic works were achieved, which earned him membership in Accademia dei Lincei. He was also a member of the Accademia del Cimento (Academy of Experiment) from 1657 to 1667.

He died in his sleep on 1 March 1697 in Pisa and his remains were returned to Arezzo for interment.

A collection of his letters is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Scientific career==

===Experimental toxicology===
In 1664 Redi wrote his first monumental work &quot;Osservazioni intorno alle vipere&quot; (&quot;Observations on Vipers&quot;) to his friend Lorenzo Magalotti, secretary of the &quot;Accademia del Cimento&quot;. In this he began to break the prevailing scientific myths (which he called &quot;unmasking of the untruths&quot;) such as vipers drink wine and shatter glasses, their venom is poisonous if swallowed, the head of the dead viper is an antidote, the viper&#x27;s venom is produced from the gallbladder, and so on. He explained rather how snake venom is unrelated to the snake’s bite, an idea contrary to popular belief. He performed a series of experiments on the effects of snakebites and demonstrated that venom was poisonous only when it enters the bloodstream via a bite, and that the fang contains venom in the form of yellow fluid. He even showed that by applying a tight ligature before the wound, the passage of venom into the heart could be prevented. This work marked the beginning of experimental toxinology/toxicology.

===Entomology and spontaneous generation===

Redi is best known for his series of experiments, published in 1668 as &quot;Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl&#x27;insetti&quot; (&quot;Experiments on the Generation of Insects&quot;), which is regarded as his masterpiece and a milestone in the history of modern science. The book is one of the first steps in refuting &quot;spontaneous generation&quot;—a theory also known as Aristotelian abiogenesis. At the time, the prevailing wisdom was that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.

Redi took six jars and divided them into two groups of three: In one experiment, in the first jar of each group, he put an unknown object; in the second, a dead fish; in the last, a raw chunk of veal. Redi covered the tops of the first group of jars with fine gauze so that only air could get into them. He left the other group open. After several days, he saw maggots appear on the objects in the open jars, on which flies had been able to land, but not in the gauze-covered jars. In the second experiment, meat was kept in three jars. One of the jars was uncovered, and two of the jars were covered, one with cork and the other one with gauze. Flies could only enter the uncovered jar, and in this, maggots appeared. In the jar that was covered with gauze, maggots appeared on the gauze but did not survive.

Redi continued his experiments by capturing the maggots and waiting for them to metamorphose, which they did, becoming flies. Also, when dead flies or maggots were put in sealed jars with dead animals or veal, no maggots appeared, but when the same thing was done with living flies, maggots did. His interpretations were always based on biblical passages, such as his famous adage: &quot;omne vivum ex vivo&quot; (&quot;All life comes from life&quot;).

===Parasitology===
Redi was the first to describe ectoparasites in his &quot;Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl&#x27;insetti&quot;. His notable illustrations in the book are those relevant to ticks, including deer ticks and tiger ticks; it also contains the first depiction of the larva of Cephenemyiinae, the nasal flies of deer, as well as the sheep liver fluke (&quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;). His next treatise in 1684 titled &quot;Osservazioni intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi&quot; (&quot;Observations on Living Animals, that are in Living Animals&quot;) recorded the descriptions and the illustrations of more than 100 parasites. In it, he also differentiates the earthworm (generally regarded as a helminth) and &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;, the human roundworm. An important innovation from the book is his experiments in chemotherapy in which he employed the &quot;control&quot;&#x27;, the basis of experimental design in modern biological research. He described some 180 species of parasites. Perhaps, his most significant observation was that parasites produce eggs and develop from them, which contradicted the prevailing opinion that they are produced spontaneously.
==Literary career==
As a poet, Redi is best known for the dithyramb &quot;Bacco in Toscana&quot; (&quot;Bacchus in Tuscany&quot;), which first appeared in 1685. His bacchanalian poem in praise of Tuscan wines is still read in Italy today. He was admitted to two literary societies: the Academy of Arcadia and the &quot;Accademia della Crusca&quot;. He was an active member of Crusca and supported the preparation of the Tuscan dictionary. He taught the Tuscan language as a &quot;lettore pubblico di lingua toscana&quot; in Florence in 1666. He also composed many other literary works, including his &quot;Letters&quot;, and &quot;Arianna Inferma&quot;.

==Eponyms==
* Redi, a crater on Mars was named in his honor.
* The larval stage of parasitic fluke called &quot;redia&quot; is named after Redi by another Italian zoologist, Filippo de Filippi, in 1837.
* The Redi Award, the most prestigious award in toxinology, is given in his honour by the International Society on Toxinology. The award is made at each World Congress of IST (generally held every three years) since 1967.
* A scientific journal &quot;Redia&quot;, an Italian journal of zoology, is named in his honour, which was first published in 1903.
* A European viper subspecies, &quot;Vipera aspis francisciredi&quot; Laurenti, 1768, is named after him.

<doc id="140758" wikidata="Q189737" url="?curid=140758" title="Timpani">
<text>Timpani (; ) or kettledrums (also informally called timps) are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum categorised as a hemispherical drum, they consist of a membrane called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. Thus timpani are an example of kettledrums, also known as vessel drums and semispherical drums, whose body is similar to a section of a sphere whose cut conforms the head. Most modern timpani are &quot;pedal timpani&quot; and can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players through the use of a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized beater called a &quot;timpani stick&quot; or &quot;timpani mallet&quot;. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras, and even in some rock bands.

&quot;Timpani&quot; is an Italian plural, the singular of which is , though the singular may also be referred to as a &quot;timpanum.&quot; In English the term &quot;timpano&quot; is only widely in use by practitioners: several are more typically referred to collectively as &quot;kettledrums&quot;, &quot;timpani&quot;, &quot;temple drums&quot;, or &quot;timps&quot;. They are also often incorrectly termed &quot;timpanis&quot;. A musician who plays timpani is a &quot;timpanist&quot;.

==Etymology and alternative spellings==
First attested in English in the late 19th century, the Italian word derives from the Latin (pl. ), which is the latinisation of the Greek word (, pl. ), &#x27;a hand drum&#x27;, which in turn derives from the verb (), meaning &#x27;to strike, to hit&#x27;. Alternative spellings with &quot;y&quot; in place of either or both &quot;i&quot;″s—&quot;tympani&quot;, &quot;tympany&quot;, or &quot;timpany&quot;—are occasionally encountered in older English texts. Although the word &quot;timpani&quot; has been widely adopted in the English language, some English speakers choose to use the word &quot;kettledrums&quot;. The German word for timpani is ; the Swedish word is in plural (from the word ), the French and Spanish is , not to be confused with the latin percussion instrument, which would actually supersede the timpani in the traditional Cuban ensemble known as Charanga.

The tympanum is mentioned, along with a faux name origin, in the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; of St. Isidore of Seville:

The tympanum is a skin or hide stretched over one end of a wooden frame. It is half of a symphonia (&quot;i.e. another type of drum&quot;) and it looks like a sieve. The tympanum is so named because it is a half, whence also the half-pearl is called a tympanum. Like the symphonia, it is struck with a drumstick.

The reference comparing the tympanum to half a pearl is borrowed from Pliny the Elder.

== Construction ==
=== Basic timpani ===
The basic timpano consists of a drum head stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass or aluminum. In the Sachs–Hornbostel classification, this makes timpani membranophones. The head is affixed to a (also called a &quot;flesh hoop&quot;), which in turn is held onto the bowl by a &quot;counter hoop&quot;. The counter hoop is usually held in place with a number of tuning screws called &quot;tension rods&quot; placed regularly around the circumference. The head&#x27;s tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.

The shape and material of the bowl&#x27;s surface help to determine the drum&#x27;s timbre. For example, hemispheric bowls produce brighter tones while parabolic bowls produce darker tones. Modern timpani are generally made with copper due to its efficient regulation of internal and external temperatures relative to aluminum and fiberglass.
Timpani come in a variety of sizes from about in diameter down to &quot;piccoli timpani&quot; of or less. A 33-inch drum can produce C2 (the C below the bass clef), and specialty piccoli timpani can play up into the treble clef. In Darius Milhaud&#x27;s 1923 ballet score &quot;La création du monde&quot;, the timpanist must play F4 (at the bottom of the treble clef).

Each drum typically has a range of a perfect fifth, or seven semitones.

=== Machine timpani ===
Changing the pitch of a timpani by turning each tension rod individually is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be considered &quot;machine timpani&quot;, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.

==== Pedal timpani ====
By far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allows the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via an assembly of either cast metal or metal rods called the &quot;spider&quot;.

There are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:
* The &quot;ratchet clutch&quot; system uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. Because the ratchet engages in only a fixed set of positions, the timpanist must fine-tune the drum by means of a fine-tuning handle.
* In the &quot;balanced action&quot; system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the head so the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a &quot;floating pedal&quot; since there is no clutch holding it in place.
* The &quot;friction clutch&quot; or &quot;post and clutch&quot; system uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees it from the post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.

Professional-level timpani use either the ratchet or friction system and have copper bowls. These drums can have one of two styles of pedals. The &quot;Dresden&quot; pedal is attached at the side nearest the timpanist and is operated by ankle motion. A &quot;Berlin&quot;-style pedal is attached by means of a long arm to the opposite side of the timpani, and the timpanist must use their entire leg to adjust the pitch. In addition to a pedal, high-end instruments have a hand-operated fine-tuner, which allows the timpanist to make minute pitch adjustments. The pedal is on either the left or right side of the drum depending on the direction of the setup.

Most school bands and orchestras below a university level use less expensive, more durable timpani with copper, fiberglass, or aluminum bowls. The mechanical parts of these instruments are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for outdoor performances due to their durability and lighter weight. The pedal is in the center of the drum itself.

=== Chain timpani ===

On &quot;chain timpani&quot;, the tension rods are connected by a roller chain much like the one found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.

=== Other tuning mechanisms ===
A rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on rototoms. Jenco, a company better known for mallet percussion, made timpani tuned in this fashion.

In the early 20th century, Hans Schnellar, the timpanist of the Vienna Philharmonic, developed a tuning mechanism in which the bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base and the head remains stationary. These instruments are referred to as &quot;Viennese timpani&quot; (&quot;Wiener Pauken&quot;) or &quot;Schnellar timpani&quot;. Adams Musical Instruments developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.

=== Heads ===
Like most drumheads, timpani heads can be made from two materials: animal skin (typically calfskin or goatskin) or plastic (typically PET film). Plastic heads are durable, weather-resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than skin heads. However, many professional timpanists prefer skin heads because they produce a &quot;warmer&quot; timbre. Timpani heads are determined based on the size of the head, not the bowl. For example, a drum may require a head. This size difference has been standardized by most timpani manufacturers since 1978.

== Sticks and mallets ==

Timpani are typically struck with a special type of drum stick called a &quot;timpani stick&quot; or &quot;timpani mallet&quot;. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from hardwood or bamboo but may also be made from aluminum or carbon fiber. The head can be constructed from a number of different materials, though felt wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, cork, and leather. Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music. Wooden timpani sticks are also occasionally used to play the suspended cymbal.

Although not usually stated in the score (excepting the occasional request to use wooden sticks), timpanists will change sticks to suit the nature of the music. However, the choice during a performance is subjective and depends on the timpanist&#x27;s preference and occasionally the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of sticks. The weight of the stick, size and latent surface area of the head, materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.

In the early 20th century and before, sticks were often made with whalebone shafts, wooden cores, and sponge wraps. Composers of that era often specified sponge-headed sticks. Modern timpanists execute such passages with felt sticks.

== Popular grips ==
The two most common grips in playing the timpani are the German and French grips. In the German grip, the palm of the hand is approximately parallel with the drum head and the thumb should be on the side of the stick. In the French grip, the palm of the hand is approximately perpendicular with drum head and the thumb is on top of the stick. In both of these styles, the fulcrum is the contact between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger is used as a guide and to help lift the stick off of the drum. The American grip is a hybrid of these two grips. Another known grip is known as the Amsterdam Grip, made famous by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which is similar to the Hinger grip, except the stick is cradled on the lower knuckle of the index finger.

== In the modern ensemble ==
=== Standard set ===
A standard set of timpani (sometimes called a console) consists of four drums: roughly , , , and in diameter. The range of this set is roughly D2 to A3. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, contemporary composers have written for extended ranges. Igor Stravinsky specifically writes for a &quot;piccolo timpano&quot; in &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, tuned to B3. A piccolo drum is typically in diameter and can reach pitches up to C4.

Beyond this extended set of five instruments, any added drums are nonstandard. (Luigi Nono&#x27;s Al gran sole carico d&#x27;amore requires as many as eleven drums, with actual melodies played on them in octaves by two players.) Many professional orchestras and timpanists own more than just one set of timpani, allowing them to execute music that cannot be more accurately performed using a standard set of four or five drums. Many schools and youth orchestra ensembles unable to afford purchase of this equipment regularly rely on a set of two or three timpani, sometimes referred to as &quot;the orchestral three&quot;. It consists of , , and drums. Its range extends down only to F2.

The drums are set up in an arc around the performer. Traditionally, North American, British, and French timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right (commonly called the &quot;American&quot; system), while German, Austrian, and Greek players set them up in the reverse order, as to resemble a drum set or upright bass (the &quot;German&quot; system). This distinction is not strict, as many North American players use the German setup and vice versa.

=== Players ===
Throughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when appointed to a principal timpani chair in a professional ensemble, a timpanist is not normally required to play any other instruments. In his book &quot;Anatomy of the Orchestra&quot;, Norman Del Mar writes that the timpanist is &quot;king of his own province&quot;, and that &quot;a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.&quot; A qualified member of the percussion section sometimes doubles as associate timpanist, performing in repertoire requiring multiple timpanists and filling in for the principal timpanist when required.

Among the professionals who have been highly regarded for their virtuosity and impact on the development of the timpani in the 20th century are Saul Goodman, Hans Schnellar, Fred Hinger, Tom Freer, and Cloyd Duff.

=== Concertos ===
A few solo concertos have been written for timpani, and are for timpani and orchestral accompaniment. The 18th-century composer Johann Fischer wrote a symphony for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. Rough contemporaries Georg Druschetzky and Johann Melchior Molter also wrote pieces for timpani and orchestra. Throughout the 19th century and much of the 20th, there were few new timpani concertos. In 1983, William Kraft, principal timpanist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, composed his &quot;Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra&quot;, which won second prize in the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards. There have been other timpani concertos, notably, Philip Glass, considered one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century, wrote a double concerto at the behest of soloist Jonathan Haas titled &quot;Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra&quot;, which features its soloists playing nine drums a piece.

== Performance techniques ==

=== Striking ===
For general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately in from the edge. Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani. A timpani roll (most commonly signaled in a score by or three slashes) is executed by striking the timpani at varying velocities; the speed of the strokes are determined by the pitch of the drum, with higher pitched timpani requiring a quicker roll than timpani tuned to a lower pitch. While performing the timpani roll, mallets are usually held a few inches apart to create more sustain. Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 requires a continuous roll on a drum for over two and a half minutes. In general, timpanists do not use multiple bounce rolls like those played on the snare drum, as the soft nature of timpani sticks causes the rebound of the stick to be reduced, causing multiple bounce rolls to sound muffled. However, when playing with wood mallets, timpanists sometimes use multiple bounce rolls.

The tone quality can be altered without switching sticks or adjusting the tuning. For example, by playing closer to the edge, the sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by changing the velocity of the stroke or playing closer to the center.

=== Tuning ===
Prior to playing, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpani will produce an in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch will rise or fall after the initial impact of a stroke, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels. Timpanists are required to have a well-developed sense of relative pitch and must develop techniques to tune in an undetectable manner and accurately in the middle of a performance. Tuning is often tested with a light tap from a finger, which produces a near-silent note.

Some timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges are accurate when used correctly. However, when the instrument is disturbed in some fashion (transported, for example), the overall pitch can change, thus the markers on the gauges may not remain reliable unless they have been adjusted immediately preceding the performance. The pitch can also be changed by room temperature and humidity. This effect also occurs due to changes in weather, especially if an outdoor performance is to take place. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the timpanist to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Even when gauges are available, good timpanists will check their intonation by ear before playing. Occasionally, timpanists use the pedals to retune while playing.

Portamento effects can be achieved by changing the pitch while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a &quot;glissando&quot;, though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani playing glissandos at the same time in his Symphony No. 4 (&quot;The Inextinguishable&quot;).
 &quot;Pedaling&quot; refers to changing the pitch with the pedal; it is an alternate term for &quot;tuning&quot;. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where they must change the pitch in the midst of playing. Early 20th-century composers such as Nielsen, Béla Bartók, Samuel Barber, and Richard Strauss took advantage of the freedom that pedal timpani afforded, often giving the timpani the bass line.

=== Muffling ===
Since timpani have a long sustain, &quot;muffling&quot; or &quot;damping&quot; is an inherent part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score to determine the length the note should sound.

The typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.

Muffling is often referred to as &quot;muting&quot;, which can also refer to playing with mutes on them (&quot;see below&quot;).

=== Extended techniques ===

It is typical for only one timpani to be struck at a time, but occasionally composers will ask for two notes. This is called a double stop, a term borrowed from the string instrument vocabulary. Ludwig van Beethoven uses this effect in the slow third movement of his Ninth Symphony, as do Johannes Brahms in the second movement of his German Requiem and Aaron Copland in El Salón México. Some modern composers occasionally require more than two notes. In this case, a timpanist can hold two sticks in one hand much like a marimbist, or more than one timpanist can be employed. In his Overture to &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, for example, Hector Berlioz realizes fully voiced chords from the timpani by requiring three timpanists and assigning one drum to each. He goes as far as ten timpanists playing three- and four-part chords on sixteen drums in his &quot;Requiem&quot;, although with the introduction of pedal tuning, this number can be reduced.

Modern composers will often specify the beating spot to alter the sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck directly in the center, they have a sound that is almost completely devoid of tone and resonance. George Gershwin uses this effect in &quot;An American in Paris&quot;. Struck close to the edge, timpani produce a very thin, hollow sound. This effect is used by composers such as Bartók, Bernstein, and Kodály.

A variation of this is to strike the head while two fingers of one hand lightly press and release spots near the center. The head will then vibrate at a harmonic much like the similar effect on a string instrument.

Resonance can cause timpani not in use to vibrate, causing a quieter sound to be produced. Timpanists must normally avoid this effect, called sympathetic resonance, but composers have exploited it in solo pieces such as Elliott Carter&#x27;s &quot;Eight Pieces for Four Timpani&quot;. Resonance is reduced by damping or muting the drums, and in some cases composers will specify that timpani be played &quot;con sordino&quot; (with mute) or &quot;coperti&quot; (covered), both of which indicate that mutes – typically small pieces of felt or leather – should be placed on the head.

Composers will sometimes specify that the timpani should be struck with implements other than timpani sticks. It is common in timpani etudes and solos for timpanists to play with their hands or fingers. Philip Glass&#x27;s &quot;Concerto Fantasy&quot; utilizes this technique during a timpani cadenza. Also, Michael Daugherty&#x27;s &quot;Raise The Roof&quot; calls for this technique to be used for a certain passage. Leonard Bernstein calls for maracas on timpani in his Symphony No. 1 &quot;Jeremiah&quot; and in his &quot;Symphonic Dances from West Side Story&quot; suite. Edward Elgar attempts to use the timpani to imitate the engine of an ocean liner in his &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; by requesting the timpanist play a soft roll with snare drum sticks. However, snare drum sticks tend to produce too loud a sound, and since this work&#x27;s premiere, the passage has been performed by striking with coins. Benjamin Britten asks for the timpanist to use drumsticks in his &quot;War Requiem&quot; to evoke the sound of a field drum.

Robert W. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Sailor and Sea&quot; calls for a &quot;whale sound&quot; on the timpani. This is achieved by moistening the thumb and rubbing it from the edge to the center of the head. Among other techniques used primarily in solo work, such as John Beck&#x27;s &quot;Sonata for Timpani&quot;, is striking the bowls. Timpanists tend to be reluctant to strike the bowls at loud levels or with hard sticks since copper can be dented easily due to its soft nature.

On some occasions a composer may ask for a metal object, commonly an upside-down cymbal, to be placed upon the head and then struck or rolled while executing a glissando on the drum. Joseph Schwantner uses this technique in &quot;From A Dark Millennium&quot;. Carl Orff asks for cymbals resting on the head while the drum is struck in his later works. Additionally, Michael Daugherty utilizes this technique in his concerto &quot;Raise The Roof&quot;. In his piece &quot;From me flows what you call Time&quot;, Tōru Takemitsu calls for Japanese temple bowls to be placed on timpani.

== History ==

=== Pre-orchestral history ===
The first recorded use of early Tympanum was in &quot;ancient times when it is known that they were used in religious ceremonies by Hebrews.&quot; The Moon of Pejeng, also known as the &quot;Pejeng Moon&quot;, in Bali, the largest single-cast bronze kettledrum in the world, is more than two thousand years old. The Moon of Pejeng is &quot;the largest known relic from Southeast Asia&#x27;s Bronze Age period.&quot; The drum is in the Pura Penataran Sasih temple.&quot;
In 1188, Cambro-Norman chronicler Gerald of Wales wrote, &quot;Ireland uses and delights in two instruments only, the harp namely, and the tympanum.&quot;

Arabian nakers, the direct ancestors of most timpani, were brought to 13th-century Continental Europe by Crusaders and Saracens. These drums, which were small (with a diameter of about ) and mounted to the player&#x27;s belt, were used primarily for military ceremonies. This form of timpani remained in use until the 16th century. In 1457, a Hungarian legation sent by King Ladislaus V carried larger timpani mounted on horseback to the court of King Charles VII in France. This variety of timpani had been used in the Middle East since the 12th century. These drums evolved together with trumpets to be the primary instruments of the cavalry. This practice continues to this day in sections of the British Army, and timpani continued to be paired with trumpets when they entered the classical orchestra.

The medieval European timpani were typically put together by hand in the southern region of France. Some drums were tightened together by horses tugging from each side of the drum by the bolts. Over the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to the timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch. The Industrial Revolution enabled the introduction of new construction techniques and materials, in particular machine and pedal tuning mechanisms. Plastic heads were introduced in the mid-20th century, led by Remo.

=== Role in orchestra ===
&quot;No written kettledrum music survives from the 16th century, because the technique and repertory were learned by oral tradition and were kept secret. An early example of trumpet and kettledrum music occurs at the beginning of Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s opera L&#x27;Orfeo (1607).&quot; Later in the Baroque era, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a secular cantata titled &quot;Tönet, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!&quot;, which translates roughly to &quot;Sound off, ye timpani! Sound, trumpets!&quot; Naturally, the timpani are placed at the forefront: the piece starts with an unusual timpani solo and the chorus and timpani trade the melody back and forth. Bach reworked this movement in Part I of the Christmas Oratorio.
Mozart and Haydn wrote many works for the timpani and even started putting it in their symphonies and other orchestral works.

Ludwig van Beethoven revolutionized timpani music in the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use. For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with four solo timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) sets the timpani (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra in a sort of call and response.

The next major innovator was Hector Berlioz. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used—&quot;felt-covered&quot;, &quot;wooden&quot;, etc. In several of his works, including &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; (1830), and his &quot;Requiem&quot; (1837), he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.

Until the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with &quot;T&quot;-shaped handles, called &quot;taps&quot;, which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they were called to tune in the middle of a work. The first &#x27;machine&#x27; timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called &quot;Dresden&quot; timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.

Despite these problems, composers eagerly exploited the opportunities the new mechanism had to offer. By 1915, Carl Nielsen was demanding glissandos on timpani in his Fourth Symphony—impossible on the old hand-tuned drums. However, it took Béla Bartók to more fully realize the flexibility the new mechanism had to offer. Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, timpani were almost always tuned with the dominant note of the piece on the low drum and the tonic on the high drum—a perfect fourth apart. Until the early 19th century the dominant (the note of the large drum) was written as G and the tonic (the note of the small drum) was written as C no matter what the actual key of the work was, and whether it was major or minor, with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score (for example, &quot;Timpani in D–A&quot; for a work in D major or D minor). This notation style however was not universal: Bach, Mozart, and Schubert (in his early works) used it, but their respective contemporaries Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven wrote for the timpani at concert pitch.
In the 2010s, even though they are written at concert pitch, timpani parts continue to be most often but not always written with no key signature, no matter what key the work is in: accidentals are written in the staff, both in the timpanist&#x27;s part and the conductor&#x27;s score. By 1977 in Vienna, Alexander Rahbari, an outstanding Iranian-Austrian composer and conductor, commenced the concert with one of his own compositions, entitled Persian Mysticism Around G, which starts with a short introduction written for timpani (five timpani tuned in &quot;B-C-D-E-G&quot;). After a few bars fomenting the primary stormy passage, he uses an effective glissando effect produced by the back and forth switching of the timpani pedals, moving from B up to C and then rolling down back to G (You can see the glissando notation and also listen to the whole timpani introduction on the right). Rahbari also makes use of a series of acciaccatura during this opening section.

=== Outside the orchestra ===

Later, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Unlike concert timpani, marching versions had fiberglass shells to make them light enough to carry. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and perform more like conventional timpani, yet with a single player per drum. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, marching arts-based organizations&#x27; allowance for timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded became mainstream. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage. Timpani are still used by the Mounted Bands of the Household Division of the British Army and of the Mounted Band of the &quot;Garde Républicaine&quot; in the French Army.
As rock and roll bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. In 1959 Leiber and Stoller made the innovative use of timpani in their production of the Drifters&#x27; recording, &quot;There Goes My Baby.&quot; Starting in the 1960s, drummers for high-profile rock acts like The Beatles, Cream, Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, and Queen incorporated timpani into their music. This led to the use of timpani in progressive rock. Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer recorded a number of rock covers of classical pieces that utilize timpani. Rush drummer Neil Peart added a tympani to his expanding arsenal of percussion for the &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978) and &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980) albums and tours, and would later sample tympani in his drum solo, &quot;The Rhythm Method&quot; in 1988. More recently, the rock band Muse has incorporated timpani into some of their classically based songs, most notably in Exogenesis: Symphony, Part I (Overture). Jazz musicians also experimented with timpani. Sun Ra used it occasionally in his Arkestra (played, for example, by percussionist Jim Herndon on the songs &quot;Reflection in Blue&quot; and &quot;El Viktor,&quot; both recorded in 1957). In 1964, Elvin Jones incorporated timpani into his drum kit on John Coltrane&#x27;s four-part composition &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. Butch Trucks, drummer with the Allman Brothers Band, made use of the timpani.

In his choral piece &quot;A Stopwatch and an Ordnance Map&quot;, Samuel Barber employs three pedal timpani upon which are played glissandos.

Jonathan Haas is one of the few timpanists who markets himself as a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. He released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called &quot;Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing&quot;. Philip Glass with his &quot;Concerto Fantasy&quot;, commissioned by Haas, put two soloists in &quot;front&quot; of the orchestra, an atypical placement for the instruments. Haas also commissioned Susman&#x27;s &quot;Floating Falling&quot; for timpani and cello.

<text>Ecbatana () was an ancient city, the capital of the Median kingdom, and the first capital in Iranian history. It later became the summer capital of the Achaemenid and Parthian empires. It was also an important city during the Seleucid and Sasanian empires. It is believed that Ecbatana is located in the Zagros Mountains, the east of central Mesopotamia, on Hagmatana Hill (Tappe-ye Hagmatāna). Ecbatana&#x27;s strategic location and resources probably made it a popular site even before the 1st millennium BC. Along with Athens in Greece, Rome in Italy and Susa in Khuzestan, Ecbatana is one of the few ancient cities in the world that is still alive and important, representing the current-day Hamadan.

== History ==

=== Median kingdom (678–550 BC) ===
According to Herodotus, Ecbatana was chosen as the Medes&#x27; capital in 678 BC by Deioces, the first ruler of the Medes. Herodotus said that it had seven walls. Deioces&#x27;s intention was to build a palace worthy of the dignity of a king. After choosing Ecbatana as his capital, Deioces decided to build a huge and strong palace in the form of seven nested castles. Herodotus says that each of them was in the color of a planet. The royal palace and the treasury were located inside the seventh castle. The outer perimeter of the castle wall was almost the size of the city wall of Athens. 

The royal palace, which was built in the last inner fort, had hundreds of rooms and people also built their houses outside of these forts, next to the palace. Some archaeologists have also attributed its construction to Phraortes, the second king of the Medes. Other old legends attribute the origin of Ecbatana to the legendary Semiramis or Jamshid. Ecbatana has also been mentioned by other Greek historians such as Polybius, Ctesias, Justin, and Xenophon. The Assyrians do not seem to mention Ecbatana, and it is likely they never penetrated east of the Alvand despite two centuries of involvement in Median areas of the central Zagros.

=== Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC) ===

In 550 BC, Cyrus the Great defeated Astyages and conquered Ecbatana, forming the Achaemenid Empire. Although Ecbatana lost its former importance, it was located on the royal road, where it connected Persepolis to Sardis, and situated at the foot of Mount Alvand. So it was settled by the Achaemenid rulers. The city became the summer capital and a treasury of the Achaemenids. As mentioned in several sources, the city was also used as a royal archive. 

In ancient times, Ecbatana was renowned for its wealth and splendid architecture. In 330 BC when Darius III faced Alexander, Ecbatana was in ruins, but Darius III ordered the construction of hundreds of hiding places in the middle of the city for treasures and assets. Some weeks before Darius III was killed in a coup in July 330 BC, Ecbatana was conquered, and Persepolis destroyed by Alexander. These events marked the end of the Achaemenid Empire.

=== Seleucid Empire (312–63 BC) ===

In 330 BC, Alexander the Great captured the treasury of Ecbatana, and he looted all the gold and silver decorations of the palace. Ecbatana was the site of the assassination of the Macedonian general Parmenion by Alexander&#x27;s order. 

Later, in 305 BC, the city was ruled by Seleucus I. The Battle of Ecbatana was fought in 129 BC between the Seleucids led by Antiochus VII Sidetes and the Parthians led by Phraates II, and marked the final attempt on the part of the Seleucids to regain their power in eastern Iran against the Parthians. After their defeat, the territory of the Seleucids was limited to the area of modern-day Syria.

=== Parthian Empire (247 BC – AD 224) ===

Ecbatana later became the summer capital of the Parthians, and their main mint, producing drachms, tetradrachms, and assorted bronze denominations. 

The wealth and importance of the city during classical antiquity are attributed to its location, a crucial crossroads that made it a staging post on the main east–west highway called High-Road. There was a reputation for horses and wheat in the area (Polybius, 5.44.1). Graphite, gold, platinum, antimony, iron, and various minerals are found there; however, the classics mention oil seeps and flares, and there is no evidence of exploitation of these resources. 

In 130 BC, with the intention of restoring the Seleucid power to Iran, Antiochus VII stopped in Ecbatana for a short period of time, just as Tigranes the Great, who stayed there in the following year to attack Mithridates II.

=== Sasanian Empire (AD 224–651) ===
Ecbatana remained loyal to the Parthians until AD 226, when Ardashir I defeated Artabanus IV and conquered Ecbatana from the north, alongside Atropatene. There is conflicting evidence as to whether Ecbatana was used as the summer capital for Sasanians or not. According to Ibn al-Faqih, buildings were built between Ctesiphon (The Sassanid capital) and Mount Alvand, but not beyond that.

=== Destruction ===
After the battle of Nahavand in 642 AD, Ecbatana fell to the Muslims, and around 1220, the city was completely destroyed by the Mongol invasion. Ecbatana was sacked in 1386 by Timur, and the population was slaughtered as a result.

===Historical descriptions===

==== Herodotus&#x27;s description ====

The Greeks thought Ecbatana to be the capital of the Median empire and credited its foundation to Deioces (the &quot;Daiukku&quot; of the cuneiform inscriptions). It is alleged that he surrounded his palace in Ecbatana with seven concentric walls of different colors. There are some indications that the walls of this complex might be an ancient ziggurat, which was a type of temple tower with multiple stories that were common in the ancient Near East. 

In the 5th century BC, Herodotus wrote of Ecbatana:&quot;The Medes built the city now called Ecbatana, the walls of which are of great size and strength, rising in circles one within the other. The plan of the place is, that each of the walls should out-top the one beyond it by the battlements. The nature of the ground, which is a gentle hill, favors this arrangements in some degree but it is mainly effected by art. The number of the circles is seven, the royal palace and the treasuries standing within the last. The circuit of the outer wall is very nearly the same with that of Athens. On this wall the battlements are white, of the next black, of the third scarlet, of the fourth blue, the fifth orange; all these colors with paint. The last two have their battlements coated respectively with silver and gold. All these fortifications Deioces had caused to be raised for himself and his own palace.&quot;

Herodotus&#x27;s description is corroborated in part by stone reliefs from the Neo-Assyrian Empire, depicting Median citadels ringed by concentric walls. Other sources attest to the historical importance of Ecbatana based on the terms used by ancient authors to describe it such as &quot;Caput Mediae&quot; (capital of Media), the Royal Seat, and the Great City. It is said that Alexander the Great deposited the treasures he took from Persepolis and Pasargadae and that one of the last acts of his life was to visit the city.

The citadel of Ecbatana is also mentioned in the Bible in Ezra 6:2, in the time of Darius I, as part of the national archives.

==== Description in the Chronicle of Nabonidus ====
The Nabonidus Chronicle, an ancient Babylonian text from the 5th century BC, describes how Astyages, the last Median king, was dethroned and how Cyrus conquered Ecbatana.&quot;King Astyages called up his troops and marched against Cyrus, king of Anšan [&quot;i.e., Persis&quot;], in order to meet him in battle. The army of Astyages revolted against him and delivered him in fetters to Cyrus. Cyrus marched against the country of Ecbatana; the royal residence he seized; silver, gold, other valuables of the country Ecbatana he took as booty and brought to Anšan.&quot;

==== Polybius of Megalopolis&#x27;s description ====

In the 2nd century BC, Polybius writes about Ecbatana. He mentions that the wealth and magnificence of its buildings make it stand out among all other cities. It has no walls but an artificial citadel with amazing fortifications. Underneath this is the palace which is about seven stories in circumference, and its magnificence shows the wealth of its founders. During his time, no parts of the woodwork were left exposed. There were silver or gold-plated rafters, compartments in the ceiling, and columns in the porticos and colonnades, and silver tiles were used throughout the structure. In the invasion by Alexander, most precious metals were stripped, while the remainder were stripped during Antigonus&#x27;s and Seleucus&#x27;s reigns. However, Antiochus found that the columns of the temple of Aene were still gilded and that several silver tiles were piled up around the temple along with some gold bricks (Polybius, 10.27).

==Archaeology==
Topographically, Hamadan is characterized by three hills, Mosalla (place of prayer), Tell Hagmatana (Tappa-ye Hagmatana), Sang-e Sir, and the Alusjerd river, which flows from north to south, separates the city into two parts.

The summit of the Moṣallā, an -high rock hill in the southeast sector, contains stone and brick remnants of a rectangular citadel marked by towers. It is believed to be the Median citadel, which dates back no earlier than the Parthian era.

The Tell Hagmatana, also called Tepe Hegmataneh (thought to correspond to the ancient citadel of Ecbatana) has a circumference of and an area of about 40 hectares, which corresponds to a report from Polybius, although the ancient Greek and Roman accounts likely exaggerate Ecbatana&#x27;s wealth, splendor, and extravagance. 

Relatively few finds thus far can be firmly dated to the Median era. There is a &quot;small, open-sided room with four corner columns supporting a domed ceiling, similar to a Median-era structure from Tepe Nush-i Jan, interpreted as a Zoroastrian fire temple. Excavations have revealed a massive defensive wall made of mud-bricks, and dated to the Median period based on a comparison to Tepe Nush-i Jan and Godin Tepe. There are also two column bases from the Achaemenid period, and some mud-brick structures thought to be from the Median or Achaemenid periods. A badly-damaged stone lion sculpture is of disputed date: it may be Achaemenid or Parthian. Numerous Parthian-era constructions attest to Ecbatana&#x27;s status as a summer capital for the Parthian rulers. In 2006, excavations in a limited area of Hagmatana hill failed to discover anything older than the Parthian period, but this does not rule out older archaeological layers existing elsewhere within the 35-hectare site.

Ecbatana was first excavated in 1913 by Charles Fossey. Fossey discovered fragments of column bases adorned with arabesques and inscriptions, glazed bricks, and faience tiles during the course of the six-week excavation of Mosalla. Based on his chance discoveries, it looks like the -high mound, Tell Hagmatana, is the site of the Median citadel and the Achaemenid royal construction. The sculptured head of a prince was found during the three months-long excavation of the eastern section. 

Excavations have been limited due to the modern town covering most of the ancient site. In 1969, the Ministry of Culture and Art began buying property on the tell in support of archaeology, though excavation did not begin until 1983. By 2007, 12 seasons of excavation had occurred. In 1974, the Iranian Centre for Archeological Research performed some excavation in the Parthian cemetery located at southeast of Hamedan. The work on the tell is ongoing.

==Ecbatana/Hagmatana==
Historians and archaeologists now believe &quot;the identification of Ecbatana with Hamadān is secure.&quot; Earlier, a lack of significant archaeological remains from the Median and Achaemenid periods had prompted suggestions of other sites for Ecbatana.

Assyrian sources never mention Hagmatana/Ecbatana. Some scholars believed the problem can be resolved by identifying the Ecbatana/Hagmatana mentioned in later Greek and Achaemenid sources with the city Sagbita/Sagbat frequently mentioned in Assyrian texts, since the Indo-Iranian sound /s/ became /h/ in many Iranian languages. The Sagbita mentioned by Assyrian sources was located in the proximity of the cities Kishesim (Kar-Nergal) and Harhar (Kar-Sharrukin).

It is now proposed that the absence of any mention of Ecbatana in Assyrian sources can be explained by the possibility that Assyria never became involved as far east as the Alvand mountains, but only in the western Zagros.

Sir Henry Rawlinson attempted to prove that there was a second and older Ecbatana in &quot;Media Atropatene&quot; on the site of the modern Takht-i-Suleiman. However, the cuneiform texts imply that there was only one city of the name, and that &quot;Takht-i Suleiman&quot; is the Gazaca of classical geography. There is also the claim that Ecbatana used to be the city of Tabriz, which is one of the historical capitals of Iran and the present capital of East Azerbaijan province. The city, which was previously called Tauris, was put forward by John-Thomas Minadoi, who cited that his identification of the city was based on data collected from modern and ancient geographers, recent travel accounts, and local informants. This theory was also promoted by other historians, such as Sir William Jones and the chief French orientalists.

Ecbatana is the supposed capital of Astyages (&quot;Istuvegü&quot;), which was taken by the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great in the sixth year of the reign of Nabonidus (550/549 BC).

==Ecbatana Museum==

Ecbatana Museum was opened in 1994. The museum is open all days of the week except Monday evening. Located in the east of Ecbatana hill, the museum building used to be a nursery school, but it has been put into changes and repairs to create a temporary museum. With an area of over 600 square meters, a significant amount of the findings from Ecbatana are kept at this museum today, with some others at the National Museum of Iran and Reza Abbasi Museum.

==Noushijan fire temple ==

The Noushijan fire temple is one of the most important and oldest fire temples in the world, which is near Ecbatana. It is also the oldest adobe temple in the world. In 1967, the excavations of this place began under the supervision of David Stronach, which led to the identification of three historical periods in three separate floors. The third floor belongs to the Parthians, the second floor belongs to the Achaemenids, and the first floor belongs to the Medes. This place was the most important fire temple of the Medes from the second half of the 8th century to the first half of the 6th century BC, and it is now one of the most important structures left from the time of the Medes.

<text>Import substitution industrialization (ISI) is a trade and economic policy that advocates replacing foreign imports with domestic production. It is based on the premise that a country should attempt to reduce its foreign dependency through the local production of industrialized products. The term primarily refers to 20th-century development economics policies, but it has been advocated since the 18th century by economists such as Friedrich List and Alexander Hamilton.

ISI policies have been enacted by developing countries with the intention of producing development and self-sufficiency by the creation of an internal market. The state leads economic development by nationalization, subsidization of manufacturing, increased taxation, and highly protectionist trade policies. In the context of Latin American development, the term &quot;Latin American structuralism&quot; refers to the era of import substitution industrialization in many Latin American countries from the 1950s to the 1980s. The theories behind Latin American structuralism and ISI were organized in the works of economists such as Raúl Prebisch, Hans Singer, and Celso Furtado, and gained prominence with the creation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC or CEPAL). They were influenced by a wide range of Keynesian, communitarian, and socialist economic thought, as well as dependency theory.

By the mid-1960s, many of the economists who had previously advocated for ISI in developing countries grew disenchanted with the policy and its outcomes. Many of the countries that adopted ISI policies in the post-WWII years had abandoned ISI by the late 1980s, reducing government intervention in the economy and becoming active participants in the World Trade Organization. In contrast to ISI policies, the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) have been characterized as government intervention to facilitate &quot;export-oriented industrialization&quot;. 

ISI policies generally had distributional consequences, as the incomes of export-oriented sectors (such as agriculture) declined while the incomes of import-competing sectors (such as manufacturing) increased. Governments that adopted ISI policies ran persistent budget deficits as state-owned enterprises never became profitable. They also ran current accounts deficits, as the manufactured goods produced by ISI countries were not competitive in international markets, and as the agricultural sector (the sector which was competitive in international markets) was weakened; as a result, ISI countries ended up importing more. ISI policies were also plagued by rent-seeking.

== History ==



ISI is a development theory, but its political implementation and theoretical rationale are rooted in trade theory. It has been argued that all or virtually all nations that have industrialized have followed ISI. Import substitution was heavily practiced during the mid-20th century as a form of developmental theory that advocated increased productivity and economic gains within a country. It was an inward-looking economic theory practiced by developing nations after World War II. Many economists then considered the ISI approach as a remedy to mass poverty by bringing a developing country to a developed status through national industrialization. Mass poverty is defined as &quot;the dominance of agricultural and mineral activities – in the low-income countries, and in their inability, because of their structure, to profit from international trade.&quot;

Mercantilist economic theory and practices of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries frequently advocated building up domestic manufacturing and import substitution. In the early United States, the Hamiltonian economic program, specifically the third report and the &quot;magnum opus&quot; of Alexander Hamilton, the &quot;Report on Manufactures&quot;, advocated for the U.S. to become self-sufficient in manufactured goods. That formed the basis of the American School in economics, which was an influential force in the country during its 19th-century industrialization.

Werner Baer contends that all countries that have industrialized after the United Kingdom have gone through a stage of ISI in which much investment in industry was directed to replace imports. Going further, in his book &quot;Kicking Away the Ladder&quot;, the South Korean economist Ha-Joon Chang also argues based on economic history that all major developed countries, including the United Kingdom, used interventionist economic policies to promote industrialization and protected national companies until they had reached a level of development in which they were able to compete in the global market. Those countries adopted free market discourses directed at other countries to obtain two objectives: to open their markets to local products and to prevent them from adopting the same development strategies that had led to the industrialization of the developed countries.

== Theoretical basis ==
As a set of development policies, ISI policies are theoretically grounded on the Prebisch–Singer thesis, on the infant industry argument, and on Keynesian economics. The associated practices are commonly:
* an active industrial policy to subsidize and orchestrate production of strategic substitutes
* protective barriers to trade (such as tariffs)
* an overvalued currency to help manufacturers import capital goods (heavy machinery)
* discouragement of foreign direct investment

By placing high tariffs on imports and other protectionist, inward-looking trade policies, the citizens of any given country by using a simple supply-and-demand rationale substitute the less expensive good for a more expensive one. The primary industry of importance would gather its resources, such as labor from other industries in this situation. The industrial sector would use resources, capital, and labor from the agricultural sector. In time, a developing country would look and behave similar to a developed country, and with a new accumulation of capital and an increase of total factor productivity, the nation&#x27;s industry would in principle be capable of trading internationally and of competing in the world market. Bishwanath Goldar, in his paper &quot;Import Substitution, Industrial Concentration and Productivity Growth in Indian Manufacturing&quot;, wrote: &quot;Earlier studies on productivity for the industrial sector of developing countries have indicated that increases in total factor productivity, (TFP) are an important source of industrial growth&quot;. He continued that &quot;a higher growth rate in output, other things remaining the same, would enable the industry to attain a higher rate of technological progress (since more investment would be made) and create a situation in which the constituent firms could take greater advantage of scale economies.&quot; It is believed that ISI will allow that.

In many cases, however, the assertions did not apply. On several occasions, the Brazilian ISI process, which occurred from 1930 to the late 1980s, involved currency devaluations to boost exports and discouraging imports, thus promoting the consumption of locally manufactured products, as well as the adoption of different exchange rates for importing capital goods and for importing consumer goods. Moreover, government policies toward investment were not always opposed to foreign capital: the Brazilian industrialization process was based on a tripod that involved governmental, private, and foreign capital, the first being directed to infrastructure and heavy industry, the second to manufacturing consumer goods, and the third to the production of durable goods such as automobiles. Volkswagen, Ford, GM, and Mercedes all established production facilities in Brazil in the 1950s and the 1960s.

The principal concept underlying ISI can thus be described as an attempt to reduce foreign dependency of a country&#x27;s economy by the local production of industrialized products by national or foreign investment for domestic or foreign consumption. Import substitution does not mean eliminating imports. Indeed, as a country industrializes, it naturally imports new materials that its industries need, often including petroleum, chemicals, and raw materials.

===Local ownership import substituting===
In 2006, Michael Shuman proposed local ownership import substituting (LOIS), as an alternative to neoliberalism. It rejects the view that there is no alternative. Shuman claims that LOIS businesses are long-term wealth generators, are less likely to exit destructively, and have higher economic multipliers.

== Latin America ==
Import substitution policies were adopted by most nations in Latin America from the 1930s to the late 1980s. The initial date is largely attributed to the impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s, when Latin American countries, which exported primary products and imported almost all of the industrialized goods that they consumed, were prevented from importing because of a sharp decline in their foreign sales, which served as an incentive for the domestic production of the goods that they needed.

The first steps in import substitution were less theoretical and more pragmatic choices on how to face the limitations imposed by recession even though the governments in Argentina (Juan Domingo Perón) and Brazil (Getúlio Vargas) had the precedent of Fascist Italy (and, to some extent, the Soviet Union) as inspirations of state-induced industrialization. Positivist thinking, which sought a strong government to modernize society, played a major influence on Latin American military thinking in the 20th century. The officials, many of whom rose to power, like Perón and Vargas, considered industrialization (especially steel production) to be synonymous with &quot;progress&quot; and naturally placed as a priority.

ISI gained a theoretical foundation only in the 1950s, when the Argentine economist and UNECLAC leader Raúl Prebisch was a visible proponent of the idea, as well as the Brazilian economist Celso Furtado.

Prebisch had experience running his country&#x27;s central bank and started to question the model of export-led growth. Prebisch came to the conclusion that the participants in the free-trade regime had unequal power and that the central economies (particularly, Britain and the United States) that manufactured industrial goods could control the price of their exports. The unequal powers were taking the wealth from developing countries, leaving them with no way to prosper. He believed that developing countries needed to create local vertical linkages and that they could not succeed except by creating industries that used the primary products already being produced domestically. Tariffs were designed to allow domestic infant industries to prosper. In doing so, Prebisch predicted many benefits: dependence on imports would lower, and the country would not be forced to sell agricultural goods for low prices to pay for industrial goods, the income rate would go up, and the country itself would have a strong growth.

ISI was most successful in countries with large populations and income levels, which allowed for the consumption of locally produced products. Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico (and to a lesser extent Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela) had the most success with ISI. 

While the investment to produce cheap consumer products may be profitable in small markets, the same cannot be said for capital-intensive industries, such as automobiles and heavy machinery, which depend on larger markets to survive. Thus, smaller and poorer countries, such as Ecuador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic, could implement ISI only to a limited extent. Peru implemented ISI in 1961, and the policy lasted until the end of the decade in some form.

To overcome the difficulties of implementing ISI in small-scale economies, proponents of the economic policy, some within UNECLAC, suggested two alternatives to enlarge consumer markets: income redistribution within each country by agrarian reform and other initiatives aimed at bringing Latin America&#x27;s enormous marginalized population into the consumer market and regional integration by initiatives such as the Latin American Free Trade Association (ALALC), which would allow for the products of one country to be sold in another.

In Latin American countries in which ISI was most successful, it was accompanied by structural changes to the government. Old neocolonial governments were replaced by more-or-less democratic governments. Banks, utilities, and certain other foreign-owned companies were nationalized or had their ownership transferred to locals.

Many economists contend that ISI failed in Latin America and was one of many factors leading to the so-called lost decade of Latin American economics.

Against most opinions, one historian argued that ISI was successful in fostering a great deal of social and economic development in Latin America:

&quot;By the early 1960s, domestic industry supplied 95% of Mexico&#x27;s and 98% of Brazil&#x27;s consumer goods. Between 1950 and 1980, Latin America&#x27;s industrial output went up six times, keeping well ahead of population growth. Infant mortality fell from 107 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 69 per 1,000 in 1980, [and] life expectancy rose from 52 to 64 years. In the mid-1950s, Latin America&#x27;s economies were growing faster than those of the industrialized West.&quot;

== Africa ==
ISI policies were implemented in various forms across Africa from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s to promote indigenous economic growth within newly independent states. The national impetus for ISI can be seen from 1927, with the creation of the East African and Central African common markets in British and French colonies that recognized the importance of common trading tariffs in specific parts of the continent and aimed to protect domestic manufacturing from external competitors. 

=== Colonial economies ===
Early attempts at ISI were stifled by colonial neomercantilist policies of the 1940s and the 1950s that aimed to generate growth by exporting primary products to the detriment of imports. The promotion of exports to metropoles was the primary goal of the colonial economic system. The metropolitan governments aimed to offset colonial expenditures and attain primary commercial products from Africa at a significantly reduced rate. That was successful for British commercial interests in Ghana and Nigeria, which increased 20 times the value of foreign trade between 1897 and 1960 because of the promotion of export crops such as cocoa and palm oil. Such economic growth occurred at the expense of indigenous communities, which had no say over the crops that were produced and retained marginal profits from their agricultural output. That model also expanded monocultures, whose economies were centered on a single crop or natural resource for exports. Monoculturing was prevalent in countries such as Senegal and Gambia, where groundnuts accounted for 85% to 90% of earnings throughout the 1940s. That economic model rendered the postcolonial states vulnerable to unstable export prices and failed to promote the diversification of the economy. Postcolonial governments were also sceptical of the reliance on multinational corporations for economic development, as they were less likely to pay taxes and exported capital abroad. Thus, ISI policies were adopted to redirect African economies towards indigenous growth and industrialisation.

=== Post-colonial economic situation ===
The underdeveloped political and economic structures inherited across post-colonial Africa created a domestic impetus for ISI. Marxist historians such as Walter Rodney contend that the gross underdevelopment in social services were a direct result of colonial economic strategy, which had to be abandoned to generate sustainable development. Rene Dumont supported that observation and argued that African states were administratively overburdened as a result of colonialism. The initial, unchanged conditions created discontent in states such as Ghana and Tanzania during the early 1960s over the fall in wages and employment opportunities. The unrest culminated in a series of mass strikes and tensions between governments and trade unions. Dissatisfaction with the poor economic progress upon decolonisation made it clear to African leaders that they could no longer rely on rhetoric and tradition to maintain power and could retain the support of their political base only through a coherent economic model aligned with their political interests. The culmination of the political and economic issues necessitated the adoption of ISI, as it rejected the colonial neo-mercantilist policies that they believed had led to underdevelopment.

=== Ideological foundation ===
For leaders of post-colonial African nations, it was imperative for their economic policies to represent an ideological break with the imperialist models of development. To achieve that, some newly independent states pursued African socialism to build indigenous growth and break free from capitalist development patterns. Through the adoption of African socialism, leaders such as Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, and Leopold Senghor hoped to establish a model of development based around consciencism, an intellectual and cultural revolution; and, most importantly, a big push in industrialization towards rapid development for the continent. One of the main aspects of the big push towards development was the growth of parastatals from 1960 to 1980. The state-owned trading corporations were given control over the import-export business as well as the retail-wholesale distribution. That allowed post-colonial states to nationalise industries and retain the profits from their output, rather than allow capital flight to the west through multinational corporations.

The growth of African socialism in the pursuit of ISI can be seen in the 1967 Arusha Declaration (Tanzania) in which Nyerere argued that &quot;we cannot get enough money and borrow enough technicians to start all the industries we need and even if we could get the necessary assistance, dependence on it would interfere with our policy on socialism.&quot; The need for indigenous development formed the core of the African socialist vision whereby the state would manage a planned economy to prevent it from being controlled by the free market, which was regarded as a form of neo-imperialism. In line with that economic vision, Tanzania engaged in the nationalization of industry to create jobs and to produce a domestic market for goods while it maintained an adherence to African socialist principles exemplified through the ujamaa program of villagization. The unaffordability of industrial products and increased tensions between managers and settlers of the villages contributed to a &quot;colossal failure&quot; of ISI in Tanzania, leading it to abandon the villagization project and to focus on agricultural development.

While ISI under African socialism was purported to be an anti-Western development model, scholars such as Anthony Smith argued that its ideological roots came from Rostow&#x27;s modernization theory, which maintains that commitment to economic growth and free-market capitalism is the most efficient means of state development. Kenya&#x27;s implementation of ISI under state capitalism exemplifies the model of development. Tom Mboya, the first minister for economic development and planning, aimed to create a growth-oriented path of industrialization, even at the expense of traditional socialist morals. Kenya&#x27;s Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965 reinforced the view by claiming, &quot;If Africanization is undertaken at the expense of growth, our reward will be a falling standard of living.&quot; Under such a development path, multinational corporations occupied a dominant role in the economy, primarily in the manufacturing sectors. Economic historians such as Ralph Austen argue that the openness to western enterprise and technical expertise led to a higher GNP in Kenya than comparative socialist countries such as Ghana and Tanzania. However, the 1972 World Bank ILO report on Kenya claimed that direct state intervention was necessary to reduce the growing economic inequalities that had occurred as a result of state capitalism.

=== Implementation ===
In all of the countries that adopted ISI, the state oversaw and managed its implementation, designing economic policies that directed development towards the indigenous population, with the aim of creating an industrialised economy. The 1972 Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree exemplified such control, as it required foreign companies to offer at least 40% of their equity shares to local people. A state-controlled economy has been criticized by scholars such as Douglas North who claim that the interests of political elites may be self-serving, rather than for the good of the nation. That correlates with the theory of neo-patrimonialism, which claims that post-colonial elites used the coercive powers of the state to maintain their political positions and to increase their personal wealth. Ola Olson opposes that view by arguing that in a developing economy, the government is the only actor with the financial and political means to unify the state apparatus behind an industrialization process. 

=== Outcomes ===
Sub-Saharan Africa&#x27;s experiment with ISI created largely pessimistic results across the continent by the early 1980s. Manufacturing, which formed the core of the big push towards industrialisation, accounted for only 7% of GDP across the continent by 1983. The failures of the model stemmed from various external and domestic factors. Internally, efforts to industrialise came at the expense of the agricultural sector, which accounted for 70% of the region&#x27;s workforce throughout the 1970s. The neglect was detrimental to producers as well as the urban population, as agricultural output could not meet the increasing demands for foodstuffs and raw materials in the growing urban areas. ISI efforts also suffered from a comparative disadvantage in skilled labor for industrial growth.

A 1982 World Bank report stated, &quot;There exists a chronic shortage of skills which pervades not only the small manufacturing sector but the entire economy and the over-loaded government machine.&quot; Tanzania, for example, had only two engineers at the beginning of the import-substitution period. The skills shortage was exacerbated by the technological deficiencies facing African states throughout industrialisation. Learning and adopting the technological resources and skills was a protracted and costly process, something that African states were unable to capitalise on because of the lack of domestic savings and poor literacy rates across the continent.

The failure of ISI to generate sufficient growth in industrialisation and overall development led to its abandonment by the early 1980s. In response to the underdeveloped economies in the region, the IMF and the World Bank imposed a counter-revolution in Africa through Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) from 1981.

The new economic consensus blamed the low growth rates on excessive protectionism in the industrial sector, the neglect of exports, and the low agricultural productivity. For the IMF and the World Bank, the solution to the failure of import substitution was a restructuring of the economy towards strict adherence to a neoliberal model of development throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.

== Russia ==
In 2014, customs duties were applied on imported products in the food sector. Russia has considerably reduced its food imports, and domestic production has increased considerably. The cost of food imports dropped from $60 billion in 2014 to $20 billion in 2017, and the country enjoys record cereal production. Russia has strengthened its position on the world food market and has become food self-sufficient. In the fisheries, fruit, and vegetables sectors, domestic production has increased sharply, imports have declined significantly, and the trade balance (the difference between exports and imports) has improved. In the second quarter of 2017, agricultural exports were expected to exceed imports, which would make Russia a net agricultural exporter for the first time in almost 100 years.

== Criticism ==
Import substitution policies might create jobs in the short run, but as domestic producers replace foreign producers, both output and growth are lower than would otherwise have been in the long run. Import substitution denies the country the benefits to be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries within the model gain from trade, however, this concept has received criticism for its misguided underlying assumptions and inapplicability to modern production. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency, as domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.

=== Results ===
Despite some apparent gains, import substitution was &quot;both unsustainable over time and produced high economic and social costs&quot;. Given import substitution&#x27;s dependence upon its developed and isolated markets within Latin America, it relied upon the growth of a market that was limited in size. In most cases, the lack of experience in manufacturing and the lack of competition reduced innovation and efficiency, which restrained the quality of Latin American produced goods, and protectionist policies kept prices high. In addition, power was concentrated in the hands of a few, which decreased the incentive for entrepreneurial development. Lastly, the large deficits and debts resulting from import substitution policies are largely credited for the Latin American crisis of the 1980s.

<text>Fernando Valenzuela Anguamea (; November 1, 1960 – October 22, 2024), nicknamed &quot;El Toro&quot;, was a Mexican professional baseball pitcher. Valenzuela played 17 Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons, from 1980 to 1997 (except for a one-year sabbatical in Mexico in 1992). He played for six MLB teams, most prominently with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who signed him in 1979 and gave him his MLB debut in 1980. Valenzuela batted and threw left-handed, with an unorthodox windup. He was one of a small number of pitchers who regularly threw a screwball in the modern era.

Valenzuela enjoyed his breakout year in 1981, when &quot;Fernandomania&quot; rapidly catapulted him from relative obscurity to stardom. He won his first eight starts, five of them shutouts, and finished with a win–loss record of 13–7 and had a 2.48 earned run average (ERA) in a season that was shortened by a player&#x27;s strike. He became the first, and as of 2024, only player to win both the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. The Dodgers won the World Series that year.

Valenzuela peaked from 1981 to 1986, when he was named a National League (NL) All-Star in each season. He won an NL-leading 21 games in 1986, when he was a runner-up to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros for the Cy Young Award. Valenzuela was also one of the better hitting pitchers of his era. He had ten career home runs and was occasionally used by Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda as a pinch-hitter. In 1986, he signed the then-largest contract for a pitcher in baseball history ($5.5 million/3 years). However, nagging shoulder problems diminished the remainder of his Dodgers career. He was on the Dodgers&#x27; 1988 World Series championship team, but sat out the postseason with a shoulder injury. Valenzuela threw a no-hitter in 1990 before the Dodgers released him prior to the 1991 season. He spent the rest of his major league career with the California Angels, Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres, and St. Louis Cardinals, before pitching a couple of seasons in Mexico in his 40s.

Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers organization after retiring, serving as a broadcaster from 2003 to 2024, the year of his death. The Dodgers retired his 34 in 2023. His career highlights include a record of 173–153, with an ERA of 3.54. His 41.5 career wins above replacement (according to Baseball Reference) is the highest of any Mexican-born MLB player.

== Early life ==
Valenzuela was born on November 1, 1960, in Etchohuaquila, a small town within the municipality of Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico. He was the youngest of 12 children. His parents, Avelino and María, were poor farmers who worked the land with the help of their children and were of Mayo indigenous ancestry.

== Playing career ==

===Early career in Mexico===
In 1977, Valenzuela began his professional baseball career, signing with the Mayos de Navojoa of the Mexican Pacific League. A year later, he was sent to the Guanajuato Tuzos of the Mexican Central League, posting a 5–6 win–loss record with a 2.23 earned run average (ERA). The following year, the Mexican Central League was absorbed into the expanded Mexican League, automatically elevating then 18-year-old Valenzuela to the Triple-A level. Pitching for the Leones de Yucatán that year, Valenzuela went 10–12 with a 2.49 ERA and 141 strikeouts.

A number of Major League Baseball (MLB) teams scouted Valenzuela during this time. Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley, conscious of the large Latino population in Los Angeles, had wanted a Mexican ace pitcher for some time. Even so, the Dodgers found Valenzuela by accident. They sent scout Mike Brito to a game in Mexico to evaluate a shortstop named Ali Uscanga. Valenzuela threw three balls to Uscanga to fall behind in the count and then threw three straight strikes for the strikeout. Brito said later that at that point, he &quot;forgot all about the shortstop&quot;. The Dodgers bought out Valenzuela&#x27;s Liga contract on July 6, 1979, for $120,000 (about $521,158 in 2024), of which $20,000 went to Valenzuela and $100,000 went to the team. The New York Yankees subsequently offered $150,000, but the Leones honored their original deal, and Valenzuela became a Dodger.

=== Move to the Los Angeles Dodgers organization ===
After acquiring Valenzuela in the summer of 1979, the Dodgers assigned him to the Lodi Dodgers of the High-A California League, where he posted a 1–2 record and a 1.13 earned run average (ERA) in limited action. Brito worried that Valenzuela did not throw with enough velocity and felt that he needed to develop an off-speed pitch, so the Dodgers had their pitcher Bobby Castillo teach him to throw the screwball before the 1980 season. In 1980 Valenzuela was promoted to the Double-A San Antonio Dodgers, where he led the Texas League with 162 strikeouts and finished the season with a 13–9 win-loss record and a 3.10 ERA.

Valenzuela was called up to the major leagues in September 1980, serving as a reliever in the last month of the season. In his first game on September 15 against Atlanta, his catcher was Mike Scioscia, who spoke some Spanish; Valenzuela spoke little English. Valenzuela&#x27;s excellent performances as a reliever (17 scoreless innings of relief in 10 games) helped the Dodgers tie the Houston Astros for the NL West division lead. He earned two wins and a save. However, the Dodgers then lost a one-game tiebreaker—and thus, the division championship—to the Astros.

=== &quot;Fernandomania&quot; ===

Following his successful stint as a reliever in 1980, Valenzuela transitioned to a full-time starter role in his 1981 rookie season. He was unexpectedly named the Dodgers&#x27; Opening Day starter as a rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 24 hours before his scheduled start, and Burt Hooton was not ready to fill in. At first, Valenzuela did not think manager Tommy Lasorda was serious. However, he filled in and shut out the Houston Astros 2–0. He was the first rookie to start Opening Day for the Dodgers.

Valenzuela enjoyed one of the hottest starts to a career in MLB history. He began the season 8–0 with seven complete games, five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. In addition to his dominance on the mound, Valenzuela&#x27;s unusual and flamboyant pitching motion—including a glance skyward at the apex of each wind-up—drew attention of its own. His most prominent and effective pitch was the screwball, which had not been a popular pitch for decades.

An instant media icon, Valenzuela drew large crowds from Los Angeles&#x27; Latino community every time he pitched, and his rookie 1981 Topps and Fleer baseball cards were in high demand. The craze surrounding Valenzuela came to be known as &quot;Fernandomania&quot;. The Dodgers&#x27; Spanish radio broadcast ratings on KTNQ jumped from 3.4 to 8.6. His starts drew large crowds in every city. During his warm-up routine at Dodger Stadium, the PA system would play ABBA&#x27;s 1976 hit song &quot;Fernando&quot;. He became the first player to win the Rookie of the Year Award and the Cy Young Award in the same season, and finished fifth in NL MVP voting. He was also the first rookie to lead the NL in strikeouts. The Dodgers won the World Series that season.
Valenzuela was less dominant after the 1981 player strike wiped out the middle third of the season, but the left-hander still finished with a 13–7 record and a 2.48 ERA. He led the majors in shutouts (8) and strikeouts (180), and led the NL in complete games (11) and innings pitched (192.1). He was also second in the NL in wins (13). He demonstrated his unusually good batting (for a pitcher) by batting .250 and striking out just nine times in 64 at-bats. He became the first Dodgers pitcher to win the NL Silver Slugger Award.

In the NL West Division Series against the Houston Astros, Valenzuela became the youngest pitcher to start the first game of any postseason series. He also threw a 147-pitch complete game in a game 3 win over the New York Yankees in the World Series. In total, he went 3–1 in the postseason with a 2.21 ERA in innings, and he helped the Dodgers win their first World Series since 1965.

Valenzuela achieved this success knowing little English at the time. Scioscia gave some of the credit to Lasorda, who had learned Spanish during his time in the Caribbean winter leagues, and &quot;gave him all instructions in Spanish.&quot; Scioscia also &quot;learned Spanish just so he could communicate with Fernando&quot;, according to Lasorda. In 1981, the manager strictly platooned Scioscia and Steve Yeager at catcher, with Yeager seeing limited playing time with the Dodgers facing only 14 left-handers during the season. In game 3 of the World Series, Valenzuela was struggling when Lasorda substituted Scioscia, with whom the pitcher was more familiar, in place of Yeager, after Yankees left-hander Dave Righetti had exited the game. Lasorda credited Scioscia with steadying Valenzuela.

=== &quot;El Toro&quot; ===

Following his debut, Valenzuela, nicknamed (the Bull) by fans, settled down and established himself as a workhorse starter and one of the league&#x27;s best pitchers. From 1981 to 1986, Valenzuela was named an All-Star six straight times and recorded an ERA of 3.14 or below in five of these years. He also recorded top-five Cy Young Award finishes in 1981, 1982, 1985, and 1986.

Valenzuela repeatedly commanded record-setting salaries. Prior to the 1983 season, Valenzuela became the first player to be awarded a $1 million salary in arbitration (equivalent to $ million in ), with his drawing power cited as part of the pitch. Before the 1986 season, he signed a contract worth $5.5 million over three years (equivalent to $ million in ), then the wealthiest contract for a pitcher in baseball history. His annual average salary of $1,833,333 and 1988 salary of $2.05 million (equivalent to $ million in ) also both set records for a pitcher.

In 1986, Valenzuela finished 21–11 with a 3.14 ERA and led the league in wins, complete games and innings pitched. He lost a narrow vote for the 1986 NL Cy Young Award to the Astros&#x27; Mike Scott. He also won the Gold Glove. In the 1986 All-Star Game, Valenzuela made history by striking out five consecutive American League batters, tying a record set by fellow left-handed screwballer Carl Hubbell in the 1934 contest.

Valenzuela&#x27;s performance declined in 1987 with a 14–14 win–loss record and 3.98 ERA. In 1988, a year in which the Dodgers won the World Series, he was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career due to left shoulder problems. He had pitched 255 games without missing a start. Valenzuela was out for two months, before making a cameo appearance with a three-inning start and a four-inning relief stint. He finished the season 5–8 with a 4.24 ERA, before being left off the playoff roster and getting needed rest. Although the Dodgers awarded him a second World Series ring, he refused to wear it, explaining that &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything.&quot;

He improved slightly in 1989 and went 10–13. However, commentators noted &quot;an obvious loss of velocity&quot; following his 1988 shoulder injury. In the off-season, he signed a one-year, $2 million contract for 1990. In 1990, he posted a 13–13 record and his then-career worst 4.59 ERA. He had one last great moment on June 29, 1990, when he threw a 6–0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals just hours after the Oakland Athletics&#x27; Dave Stewart had thrown one against the Toronto Blue Jays. According to Lasorda, Valenzuela predicted to some of his teammates, &quot;That&#x27;s great, now maybe we&#x27;ll see another no-hitter&quot;. (Scioscia recalled that Valenzuela&#x27;s words were &quot;You saw [a no-hitter] on TV, now you&#x27;re going to see one in person.&quot;) It was the first time in the modern baseball era that two no-hitters were thrown on the same day.

=== Post-Dodgers career ===

After struggling in spring training at 1–2 and a 7.88 ERA in 16 innings in 1991, Valenzuela was released by the Dodgers. At the time of his release, several Dodgers leaders, including Lasorda, Fred Claire, and Peter O&#x27;Malley, praised Valenzuela for creating exciting memories over several seasons and indicated that it was a difficult decision to release him. However, others described his cut as a cost-cutting move, as the Dodgers were facing a deadline to guarantee Valenzuela&#x27;s $2.55 million contract.

With respect to the major leagues, 1991 and 1992 were essentially lost seasons for Valenzuela. Being cut late in 1991 spring training, when most rosters were already fixed, made it hard for Valenzuela to find a new team that year. He signed with the California Angels later that summer, but played in only two games and posted a 12.15 ERA. He spent most of the season on the disabled list due to a heart problem. In 1992, he was out of the majors entirely and played for Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican League, going 10–9 with a 3.86 overall ERA, including an improved 2.70 in the second half. He completed 13 games in 22 starts.

Valenzuela returned to the majors in 1993 with the Baltimore Orioles. He was relatively healthy, making 31 starts, but gave up more walks than strikeouts for only the second time in his career (the other time being his injury-plagued 1988 season). His ERA was an unimpressive 4.94. He returned to the Mexican League for the start of 1994, but got another opportunity in the majors with the Philadelphia Phillies, who needed injury replacements for their starting rotation. He pitched well, starting 7 games and recording a 3.00 ERA until a players&#x27; strike wiped out the remainder of the season. When the Phillies announced that Valenzuela would start the July 4, 1994, Dodgers-Phillies game in Los Angeles, the Dodgers sold nearly 20,000 tickets within a week and recorded a sellout. Valenzuela gave up two runs in six innings; both runs were partially caused by a muffed fly ball &quot;that was charitably scored a double.&quot; The Dodgers won 3–1.

Valenzuela moved back to Southern California to play for the San Diego Padres, with whom he enjoyed his last successful season in 1996, going 13–8 with a 3.62 ERA. Valenzuela started MLB&#x27;s first-ever game in Mexico, helping the Padres beat the New York Mets at the Estadio Monterrey on August 16, 1996.

On June 13, 1997, the Padres traded Valenzuela, Scott Livingstone, and Phil Plantier to the St. Louis Cardinals for Rich Batchelor, Danny Jackson, and Mark Sweeney. He made five starts for the Cardinals, ending his MLB career with a record of 173–153 and a 3.54 ERA.

The Dodgers invited Valenzuela to spring training in 1999, but he declined the offer. In his mid-40s, he played a couple of seasons in the Mexican Pacific League for Águilas de Mexicali.

== Player profile ==

=== Pitching ===
Valenzuela relied on deception, command, and a large arsenal of off-speed pitches to keep opposing batters off balance. During his rookie year, Sandy Koufax noted that &quot;it&#x27;s very unusual for someone that young to have such control over so many pitches.&quot; He was never a power pitcher; at his peak he threw roughly 87–88 mph, which fell to 83–84 mph or below during his final Dodgers years and 79-84 mph in 1994. However, Valenzuela&#x27;s longtime catcher Mike Scioscia recalled that at his peak, Valenzuela &quot;had impeccable command&quot; and could &quot;move a ball 3 or 4 inches more off the corner at will.&quot; He praised Valenzuela&#x27;s ability to disguise his pitches, noting that &quot;everything looked like a fastball out of his hand.&quot;

He was best known for his screwball, which looked like a fastball and broke late. He was able to throw screwballs at varying velocities, and he could also cause them to break vertically or laterally. Rick Monday recalled that Valenzuela&#x27;s screwball was so deceptive that it could generate swinging strikes even if Valenzuela was having trouble targeting it that day. However, he also threw an effective curveball, and was also known to throw a changeup, a sinker, and a slider. In his later years he added a cutter to mitigate his diminishing effectiveness.

A workhorse starter, Valenzuela was able to remain effective late in games, despite high pitch counts, which Scioscia credited to his slow heartbeat and ability to &quot;slow the game down.&quot; In Game 3 of the 1981 World Series, with the Dodgers down 2–0 to the New York Yankees, Valenzuela struggled through difficult circumstances: he was pitching on short rest, he could not locate his signature screwball, and he surrendered nine hits and seven walks. He needed 72 pitches to get through the first three innings, and Valenzuela later recalled that Tommy Lasorda considered pulling him in the third inning. Nonetheless, he convinced Lasorda to leave him in the game. He shut down the Yankees offense for the next six innings to earn a complete game victory. He threw over 145 pitches that game, although the exact number is disputed.

Valenzuela was known for his unusual windup, which involved a skyward glance on every pitch, as well as his high leg kick. He said that he developed the former habit spontaneously during his time in the Dodgers&#x27; minor league system.

=== Hitting ===
Valenzuela was considered an atypically good hitter for a pitcher. He won the Silver Slugger award for pitchers in 1981 and 1983. Of his 41.5 career wins above replacement (WAR), 4.1 were attributed to his bat, including 1.2 WAR in 1990 (in just 78 plate appearances) and 0.6 WAR in both 1981 and 1986 (71 and 116 plate appearances, respectively). By way of comparison, Mike Hampton (the all-time leader in pitching Silver Sluggers) never tallied more than 1.2 batting WAR in a single season.

Valenzuela&#x27;s best year at the plate was 1990—his last year with the Dodgers—when he had a .304 batting average with five doubles, a home run, and 11 runs batted in (RBIs) in 69 at-bats. That gave him a 101 OPS+, meaning Valenzuela ranked just above average among all NL hitters that year, including non-pitchers. He batted .200 for his career (187 hits in 936 at-bats, roughly equivalent to two seasons as a position player) with 10 home runs, 26 doubles, and 84 RBIs. Valenzuela was even used on occasion as a pinch-hitter, batting .368 (7-for-19) as such. Twice while with the Dodgers, Valenzuela was called upon to play the outfield and first base in marathon extra-inning games in which he did not pitch.

== Retirement ==

Valenzuela was angry at the Dodgers over his 1991 release for beyond a decade. Although he lived close to Dodger Stadium, he boycotted games and team-sponsored activities. In 2003, Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers organization as the Spanish-language radio color commentator for NL West games, joining Jaime Jarrín and Pepe Yñiguez in the Spanish-language booth. In 2015, he made the jump to television, becoming the Spanish-language color commentator for the Dodgers&#x27; cable affiliate SportsNet LA. He stepped down from broadcasting in the last week of the 2024 regular season.

Valenzuela served on Team Mexico&#x27;s World Baseball Classic coaching staff in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2017.

Valenzuela purchased the Mexican League team Tigres de Quintana Roo in 2017.

== Legacy ==

=== Statistical profile and league-wide honors ===
Valenzuela&#x27;s 41.45 career wins above replacement is the highest for a Mexican player in MLB history. He was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on August 23, 2003, in a pregame ceremony at Dodger Stadium. In 2005, he was named one of three starting pitchers on MLB&#x27;s Latino Legends Team. In 2013, he was enshrined into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. Valenzuela was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2006.

On July 6, 2019, the Mexican Baseball League commemorated Valenzuela&#x27;s legacy by retiring his jersey number 34 from the entire league.

In the 2003 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, Valenzuela&#x27;s first year of eligibility, he received 6.3% of the vote. He dropped off the ballot the following year. As of August 2023, he has never been considered for induction by the Veterans&#x27; Committee.

Commentators have occasionally questioned whether Valenzuela&#x27;s sharp mid-career decline was due to overuse (Valenzuela led the league in batters faced three times in his first seven seasons), and whether he could have accumulated the counting stats necessary for the Hall of Fame if modern best practices had been in place during the 1980s. Although some commentators suggested that Valenzuela&#x27;s reliance on the screwball caused permanent damage to his shoulder, Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe firmly attributed his decline to overuse, explaining that &quot;Fernando pitched a horrendous number of innings&quot; during his years with the team.

=== Impact on the Dodgers ===
Valenzuela was an iconic figure for the Mexican-American community in Los Angeles and his impact &quot;transform[ed] what had been predominantly a white [Dodger] fan base.&quot; The Dodgers had previously courted controversy among Los Angeles&#x27; Latino community due to the location of Dodger Stadium. Starting in 1951, the city of Los Angeles had struggled to evict a predominantly Latino, working-class community in the Chavez Ravine neighborhood (see &quot;Battle of Chavez Ravine&quot;). The city promised the nearly 1,800 displaced families, which also included Italian-Americans and Chinese-Americans, that it would allow the families to return after building a public housing project on the site. However, Norris Poulson was elected mayor in 1953 on a platform opposing public housing, and the housing plan was canceled.

When the Brooklyn Dodgers announced that they were looking for a new city, Poulson sold the Chavez Ravine site to the team at a below-market price, allowing the Dodgers to build Dodger Stadium. Although the Dodgers were not directly responsible for evicting the residents of Chavez Ravine, they were the greatest beneficiary of the eviction, and thereby became a target of resentment for many Latinos in the area.

Valenzuela&#x27;s rise is credited with helping heal the divide between Latinos and the Dodger franchise. Jaime Jarrín, the Dodgers&#x27; longtime Spanish-language broadcaster, estimated that before Fernandomania, no more than 10% of fans at Dodger home games were Latino, a figure that rose to 54% by 2015. In addition to Mexican-Americans, teammate Dusty Baker noted that other Latin Americans rallied behind Valenzuela. Although the Dodgers consistently led the majors in attendance before Valenzuela&#x27;s debut, his performances drew even larger crowds to Dodger Stadium. In 1981, the Dodgers&#x27; average attendance was 42,523, which rose to 48,430 when Valenzuela started at home. Vin Scully later said that &quot;Fernandomania bordered on a religious experience.&quot;

The Dodgers retired Valenzuela&#x27;s jersey number 34 on August 11, 2023, celebrating the event with a &quot;Fernandomania&quot; weekend on August 11–13. Along with Jim Gilliam, Valenzuela is one of only two Dodgers to receive this honor despite not being in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Although Valenzuela&#x27;s number was not officially retired for several decades after Valenzuela left the Dodgers, the team had consistently (though unofficially) kept the number out of circulation out of respect for Valenzuela.

The Dodgers also invited Valenzuela to throw the ceremonial first pitch at Game 2 of the 2017 World Series at Dodger Stadium, where he was introduced by retired announcer Vin Scully and joined by Steve Yeager. Additionally, the team honored him by naming him to the inaugural Legends of Dodger Baseball class in 2019.

On October 26, 2010, ESPN broadcast a documentary commemorating Valenzuela&#x27;s arrival with the Dodgers titled &quot;Fernando Nation&quot; as part of their &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary series.

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Valenzuela married Linda Burgos, a schoolteacher from Mexico. Early in his career, Valenzuela and his family spent offseasons between the Mexican cities of Etchohuaquila and Mérida. The couple had four children, Fernando Jr., Ricardo, Linda, and Maria Fernanda. Fernando Jr. played in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox organizations as a first baseman before switching to independent league baseball and Mexican minor league baseball.

Valenzuela became a U.S. citizen on July 22, 2015, at a ceremony in downtown Los Angeles. Following his naturalization, President Obama appointed him a special ambassador for citizenship and naturalization, &quot;promoting the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of citizenship among eligible lawful permanent residents.&quot;

Valenzuela participated in two Tournament of Roses Parades—in 1983 aboard the float from the Government of Mexico and in 2008 aboard the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; float. In 1981, Valenzuela participated in the East Los Angeles Christmas Parade as Grand Marshal.

== Illness and death ==
On October 1, 2024, it was announced that Valenzuela had been hospitalized for an undisclosed illness. The Dodgers announced the following day that he would &quot;not be in the broadcast booth for the remainder of this year to focus on his health.&quot;

=== Death and funeral ===
Valenzuela died in a Los Angeles hospital on October 22, 2024, at the age of 63, three days before the 2024 World Series began between the Dodgers and the New York Yankees. His funeral took place on November 6, 2024, at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, where he was eulogized by his son Fernando Jr. and Mike Scioscia. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

Shortly after his death, Valenzuela&#x27;s illness was reported to have been liver cancer. However, his official death certificate concluded that he died of septic shock due to malfunctioning organs, which it attributed to a combination of nonalcoholic and alcoholic cirrhosis. The death certificate added that Valenzuela also might have been suffering from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

=== Memorials ===
Before Game 1 of the World Series, fans left flowers and memorabilia at the Dodger Stadium sign outside the stadium. In Game 1, the Dodgers commemorated Valenzuela&#x27;s life and career with a ceremony featuring Valenzuela&#x27;s wife and children and a moment of silence. Valenzuela&#x27;s teammates Orel Hershiser and Steve Yeager were supposed to throw out the opening pitch, but did not do so out of respect for Valenzuela. Instead, Hershiser placed a baseball on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, which was painted with Valenzuela&#x27;s No. 34. Hershiser and Yeager also wore Valenzuela&#x27;s jersey for the ceremony. Flags flew at half-staff and a mariachi band performed at the game.

The Dodgers further announced that they would wear a uniform patch honoring Valenzuela during the 2024 World Series and 2025 season. Coincidentally, the Dodgers&#x27; World Series celebrations took place on November 1, 2024, on what would have been Valenzuela&#x27;s 64th birthday. A number of people attending the victory parade and Dodger Stadium celebration held signs commemorating his birthday, and fans sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; all along the parade route.

Artist Robert Vargas completed a large mural of Valenzuela in Boyle Heights shortly after Valenzuela&#x27;s death.

<doc id="140768" wikidata="Q468716" url="?curid=140768" title="Claire Lee Chennault">
<text>Claire Lee Chennault (September 6, 1893 – July 27, 1958) was an American military aviator best known for his leadership of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; and the Chinese Nationalist Air Force in World War II.

Chennault was a fierce advocate of &quot;pursuit&quot; or fighter-interceptor aircraft during the 1930s when the United States Army Air Corps was focused primarily on high-altitude bombardment. Chennault retired from the United States Army in 1937, and went to work as an aviation adviser and trainer in China.

Starting in early 1941, Chennault commanded the 1st American Volunteer Group (nicknamed &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;). He headed both the volunteer group and the uniformed U.S. Army Air Forces units that replaced it in 1942. He feuded constantly with General Joseph Stilwell, the U.S. Army commander in China, and helped China&#x27;s Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to convince President Roosevelt to remove Stilwell in 1944. The China-Burma-India theater was strategically essential in order to fix many vital elements of the Imperial Japanese Army on the Chinese mainland to limit their use against Allied forces advancing towards Japan in the two Pacific campaigns.

== Early life ==
Chennault is generally said to have been born in Commerce, Texas, on September 6, 1893, although there is no documentary proof of his birthdate or place of birth. For most of his life, he gave 1890 as his birth year, but his widow corrected that to 1893 after his death. His parents were John Stonewall Jackson Chennault and Jessie (née Lee) Chennault. His surname is of French origin; the French pronunciation is &quot;Shen-OH&quot;, but his family pronounced it &quot;Shen-AWLT&quot;.

He grew up in the Louisiana towns of Gilbert and Waterproof. He began misrepresenting his year of birth as either 1889 or 1890, possibly because he was too young to attend college after he graduated from high school and so his father added three years to his age. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1901 and he was raised by his aunt, Louise Chase, along with his brother and her sons.

==Early military career==
Chennault attended Louisiana State University between 1909 and 1910, having given his birth month as June in order to meet their requirement that enrolling students be aged 16 &quot;at nearest birthday&quot;, and underwent ROTC training. He and his wife, Nell, moved to West Carroll Parish where he served as principal of Kilbourne School from 1913 to 1915. At the onset of World War I, he graduated from Officers&#x27; School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps on November 27, 1917. He learned to fly in the Army Air Service during World War I. Following the war he graduated from pursuit pilot training at Ellington Field, Texas, on April 23, 1922, and remained in the service after it became the Air Corps in 1926. After graduating from the Air Corps Tactical School in 1931, Chennault became Chief of the Pursuit Section at the Tactical School.

===Leadership===
Into the mid-1930s Chennault led and represented the 1st Pursuit Group of the Montgomery, Alabama-based Army Air Corps aerobatic team the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. The group performed at the 1928 National Air Races. In 1932, as a pursuit aviation instructor at Maxwell Field, Chennault re-organized the team as &quot;Three Men on the Flying Trapeze&quot;.

===Resignation===
Poor health (deafness and chronic bronchitis), disputes with superiors, and the fact that he was passed over as unqualified for promotion led Chennault to resign from the military on April 30, 1937; he separated from the service at the rank of major. As a civilian, he was recruited to go to China and join a small group of American civilians training Chinese airmen.

==In China==
Chennault arrived in China in June 1937. He had a three-month contract at a salary of $1,000 per month, charged with making a survey of the Chinese Air Force. Chiang&#x27;s English-speaking wife, Soong Mei-ling, known to Americans as &quot;Madame Chiang&quot;, was in charge of the Aeronautical Commission and thus became Chennault&#x27;s immediate supervisor. Upon the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in August, Chennault became Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s chief air adviser, assisted in the training of new Chinese Air Force pilots, and sometimes flew scouting missions in an export Curtiss H-75 fighter. His duties also included organizing the &quot;International Squadron&quot; of mercenary pilots. In late 1937, the Chinese Air Force considered attacking the Japanese home islands with bombers launched from the mainland of China with Chennault in an advisory role. Various pilots of the International Squadron, specifically the 14th International Bomber Squadron, from Britain, France, Netherlands, and the United States, proposed raiding Kagoshima with incendiary bombs but were all declined because of the &quot;exorbitant remuneration&quot; demanded by the foreign &quot;volunteers&quot;. The mission was ultimately tasked to Capt. Xu Huansheng and Lt. Tong Yen-bo of the 8th Bomber Group.

Under the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1937, Soviet-made bomber and fighter aircraft increasingly replenished China&#x27;s battered air force units previously equipped with US-made aircraft, such as the Hawk IIIs and Boeing 281 Peashooters, and were also augmented by Soviet volunteer combat aviators; while the Chinese Air Force Academy in Jianqiao Airbase was pushed hinterland with the Fall of Shanghai and Nanjing, Claire Lee Chennault went along to Kunming&#x27;s Wujiaba Airbase, in the capital of Yunnan Province in southwestern China, to reorganize and train new Chinese Air Force cadets at the academy along the American army air corps training model.

On October 21, 1939, as the Imperial Japanese schnellbombing (fast bombers flying without fighter escorts) campaign raged terror on the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing, Chennault, accompanied by four Chinese officials, boarded the Pan American Airways Boeing B-314 &quot;California Clipper &quot; in Hong Kong, arriving at San Francisco on October 26, on a special mission for Chiang Kai-shek. By 1940, seeing that the Chinese Air Force in dire need because of obsolescent aircraft, ill-trained pilots and shortage of equipment, Chiang again sent Chennault, accompanied by Chinese Air Force General Mao Bangchu, to the United States to meet with banker Dr. T. V. Soong in Washington, D.C., with the following goal: &quot;to get as many fighter planes, bombers, and transports as possible, plus all the supplies needed to maintain them and the pilots to fly the aircraft.&quot; Together, they departed on October 15, 1940, from Chongqing, China, transited at Hong Kong where they boarded Pan Am Boeing B-314 &quot;American Clipper&quot; on November 1, arriving at San Francisco on November 14. They reported to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih.

===Creation of the American Volunteer Group, the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;===
Chennault&#x27;s mission to Washington generated the concept of creating an &quot;American Volunteer Group&quot; of pilots and mechanics to serve in China. By then Dr. Soong had already begun negotiations for an increase in financial aid with U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Federal Loan Administrator Jesse H. Jones on October 17.

Washington provided the money. How to obtain the shopping list of aircraft, aviation supplies, volunteers, and funds for the Bank of China was further discussed in a meeting held at the home of Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. with Chennault, Dr. Soong, and General Mao on December 21. On April 25, 1941, the United States and China formally signed a $50 million stabilization agreement to support the Chinese currency. By December 23, 1940, upon approval by the War Department, State Department, and the President of the United States, an agreement was reached to provide China the 100 P-40B Tomahawk aircraft which had originally been built for Britain, but which the British were persuaded to give up in preference for newer models rapidly being built. With an agreement reached, General Mao returned to China aboard the SS &quot;Lurline&quot;, departing from Los Angeles, California, on January 24, 1941. Chennault followed shortly after with a promise from the War Department and President Roosevelt to be delivered to Chiang Kai-shek that several shipments of P-40C fighters were forthcoming along with pilots, mechanics, and aviation supplies.

The 100 planes were crated and sent to Burma on third-country freighters during spring 1941. At Rangoon, they were unloaded, assembled and test flown by personnel of Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO) before they were delivered to the AVG training unit at Toungoo. Their first battle occurred on December 20, 1941, with aircraft flying out of Kunming.

CAMCO delivered 99 Tomahawks before war broke out. (Many of those were later destroyed in training accidents.) The 100th fuselage was trucked to a CAMCO plant in Loiwing, China, and later made whole with parts from damaged aircraft. Shortages in equipment with spare parts almost impossible to obtain in Burma along with the slow introduction of replacement fighter aircraft were continual impediments although the AVG received 50 replacement P-40E fighters from USAAF stocks that had been originally scheduled for shipment to Britain but cancelled by the Tomahawk&#x27;s inferior flight performance to German fighters.

Chennault recruited some 300 American pilots and ground crew, posing as tourists, who were adventurers or mercenaries, not necessarily idealists out to save China. But under Chennault they developed into a crack fighting unit, always going against superior Japanese forces. They became the symbol of America&#x27;s military might in Asia. They became the Flying Tigers.

===Plan to bomb Japan===
A year before the U.S. officially entered the war, Chennault developed an ambitious plan for a sneak attack on Japanese bases. His Flying Tigers would use U.S. bombers and U.S. pilots, all with Chinese markings. He made the fantastic claim that a handful of fliers and planes could win the war single-handed. The U.S. Army was opposed to that scheme and raised obstacles by noting that being able to reach Japan depended on Chiang&#x27;s troops being able to build and protect airfields and bases close enough to Japan, which they doubted that he could do. It also had little confidence in Chennault.

Despite the military advice, U.S. civilian leaders were captivated by the idea of China winning the war with Japan swiftly with only a few U.S. airmen and planes. It was adopted by top civilian officials including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and President Roosevelt himself. However, the American attack never took place: The Nationalist Chinese had not built and secured any runways or bases close enough to reach Japan, just as the military had warned. The bombers and crews arrived after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and were used for the war in Burma, as they lacked the range to reach Japan from secure bases in China.

===Flying Tigers===

Chennault&#x27;s 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) – better known as the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; – began training in August 1941 and was primarily based out of Rangoon, Burma, and Kunming, Yunnan. Just weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, senior Chinese officials in Chongqing released details of the first aerial attack made by the group, when the American flyers encountered 10 Japanese aircraft heading to raid Kunming and successfully shot down four of the raiders.

Thus, Claire Chennault became America&#x27;s &quot;first military leader&quot; to be publicly recognized for striking a blow against the Japanese military forces – despite not being a member of the American military, but a civilian mercenary who was paid and promoted to colonel by Chiang Kai-Shek.

The Flying Tigers fought the Japanese for seven months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Chennault&#x27;s three squadrons used P-40s, and his tactics of &quot;defensive pursuit&quot;, formulated in the years when bombers were actually faster than intercepting fighter aircraft, to guard the Burma Road, Rangoon, and other strategic locations in Southeast Asia and western China against Japanese forces.

As the commander of the Chinese Air Force flight training school at , west of Kunming, Chennault also made a great contribution by training a new generation of Chinese fighter pilots. The Flying Tigers were formally incorporated into the United States Army Air Forces in 1942. Prior to that, Chennault had rejoined the Army with the rank of major on April 7, 1942. Three days later he was made colonel. Twelve days later he was promoted to brigadier general, and then within a year to major general, commanding the Fourteenth Air Force. 

Chennault had 900 aircraft at his disposal, which was more than Japan had in China.

The first magazine photo coverage of Chennault took place within &quot;Life&quot; magazine in the Monday, August 10, 1942, issue. The first &quot;Time&quot; magazine photo coverage of Chennault took place in its Monday, December 6, 1943, issue. Shortly before the &quot;Time&quot; issue appeared, Chennault encountered British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the Cairo Conference. According to historian Carlo D&#x27;Este, Chennault &quot;had been nicknamed &#x27;The Hawk&#x27; by &quot;Time&quot; Magazine and described by Antony Head, a member of the Joint Planning Staff, as &#x27;resembling a Red Indian Chief who had just taken somebody&#x27;s scalp.&#x27; Turning to [Gen. Hastings Lionel] Ismay, Churchill asked the name of the American officer in a loud voice that was overheard by the U.S. delegation and produced an embarrassed silence, finally broken when [Churchill] announced: &#x27;I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s on our side.&#x27;&quot;

===China-Burma-India theater===
Throughout the war Chennault was engaged in a bitter dispute with the American ground commander, General Joseph Stilwell.

Chennault believed that the Fourteenth Air Force, operating out of bases in China, could attack Japanese forces in concert with Nationalist troops. For his part, Stilwell wanted air assets diverted to his command to support the opening of a ground supply route through northern Burma to China. The route would provide supplies and new equipment for a greatly expanded Nationalist force of twenty to thirty modernized divisions.

Chiang Kai-shek favored Chennault&#x27;s plans, since he was suspicious of British colonial interests in Burma. He was also concerned about alliances with semi-independent generals supporting the Nationalist government, and was concerned that a major loss of military forces would enable his Communist Chinese adversaries to gain the upper hand.

The sharply differing assessments held by Stillwell and Chennault came out in a meeting in 1943 with President Roosevelt, who asked both commanders for their opinion of Chiang. Stillwell stated: &quot;He&#x27;s a vacillating, tricky, undependable old scoundrel who never keeps his word.&quot; Chennault by contrast told Roosevelt: &quot;Sir, I think the Generalissimo is one of the two or three greatest military and political leaders in the world today. He has never broken a commitment or promise to me.&quot; Chennault was supported in his disputes by Soong Mei-ling, Chiang&#x27;s politically powerful wife, who was one of the richest women in 1930s China and, unlike her husband, fluent in English.

Stilwell and Chennault loathed each other partly because of their very different personalities, which were described by the British journalist Jonathan Fenby as a clash between Stilwell, the New England Puritan and proud &quot;Yankee&quot; who &quot;prized moral courage&quot; above all else, and Chennault, the Southern gentleman and &quot;Good Ole Boy&quot;, who accepted &quot;human foibles&quot; as natural. For example, Chennault opened up a brothel in Guilin for his pilots and recruited English-speaking prostitutes from Hong Kong who fled to the inland of China to escape the Japanese. He argued that his men needed sex and it was better to have his &quot;boys&quot; visit a brothel that was regularly inspected to reduce venereal diseases. Chennault felt his men were going to visit brothels, regardless of what the rules said, and that was better to have them visit a brothel whose women were inspected for venereal diseases than one that was not since a man in the hospital for a venereal disease was one less man who could participate in the war. Stilwell was enraged when he heard about Chennault&#x27;s brothel and promptly had it shut down by saying it was disgraceful that an officer of the US Army Air Force would open such an establishment. British Field Marshal Alan Brooke, who met both Stillwell and Chennault in late 1943, wrote that Stillwell was a &quot;hopeless crank with no vision&quot; and Chennault was &quot;a very gallant airman with a limited brain.&quot;

In November 1943 the Japanese Army air forces were ready to challenge Allied forces again, and they began night and day raids on Calcutta and the Hump bases while their fighters contested Allied air intrusions over Burma. In April 1944, the Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go—the largest Japanese offensive of all time—that committed 1 million Japanese soldiers to action. The 14th Air Force was involved in strafing and bombing attacks against the Japanese advancing on the city of Changsha, which Japanese had tried and failed to take three previous times since 1938, making the city into a symbol of Chinese defiance. Relations between Stilwell and Chennault reached their low point in 1944. Stilwell used the success of Operation Ichi-Go as proof the fallacy of Chennault&#x27;s claim that air power alone could defeat Japan while Chennault accused of Stilwell of deliberately taking a defeatist attitude as a gambit to force Chiang to cede more powers of command to him. As the Japanese took Changsha in June 1944, Chennault criticized Stilwell for trying to command the Chinese armies from Burma, sending a message to Washington saying no-one had seen Stilwell in southern China recently.

Following their victory in the Fourth Battle of Changsha, the Japanese began to advance on the city of Hengyang held by the 10th Chinese Army commanded by General Xue Yue. The 14th Air Force bombed the supply lines of the advancing Japanese and Chennault reported to Washington that his &quot;boys&quot; had shot down 210 Japanese planes in the aerial battles over Hengyang. However, the Chinese soldiers holding Hengyang were ill-equipped, with the American journalist Teddy White reporting that only a third of the Chinese infantrymen had rifles, their artillery consisted of just two French artillery guns from World War I, and the majority lived on starvation rations of one bowl of rice per day. Despite their bravery in resisting Japanese assaults on Hengyang all through July and August 1944, the Chinese weaknesses in regards to weapons and food began to tell with Xue reporting his men badly needed supplies to hold Hengyang. Channault wanted to airdrop food, weapons and ammunition to the 10th Army but was vetoed by Stilwell on the grounds that to air drop supplies would &quot;set a precedent for further demands that could not be met.&quot; Chennault did have the pilots of the 14th Air Force brave Japanese anti-aircraft fire to fly in as low as 300 feet to drop supplies of food, ammunition and medical supplies, but Xue stated he needed far more. A request from Chennault to air drop 500 tons of weapons to the 10th Army was rejected by Stilwell as a &quot;waste of effort.&quot; On 7 August 1944, Xue reported the Imperial Japanese Army had broken his defense lines and entered Hengyang and the next day, Hengyang fell with Xue ordering his men to abandon the city. Fenby wrote that Hengyang would have probably fallen as the Japanese had committed overwhelming force, but the city could have held out far longer than the seven weeks that it did if only Xue and his 10th Army had received more supplies, stating that Stilwell was remiss in attempting to command Sino-American forces fighting in Burma and in China at the same time.

The Japanese ground forces advanced and seized Chennault&#x27;s forward bases. Slowly, however, the greater numbers and greater skill of the Allied air forces began to assert themselves. By mid-1944, Major General George Stratemeyer&#x27;s Eastern Air Command dominated the skies over Burma, a superiority that was never to be relinquished. At the same time, logistical support reaching India and China via the Hump finally reached levels permitting an Allied offensive into northern Burma. Chennault had long argued for expansion of the airlift, doubting that any ground supply network through Burma could provide the tonnage needed to re-equip Chiang&#x27;s divisions. However, work on the Ledo Road overland route continued throughout 1944 and was completed in January 1945. Training of the new Chinese divisions commenced; however, predictions of monthly tonnage (65,000 per month) over the road were never achieved. By the time Nationalist armies began to receive large amounts of supplies via the Ledo Road, the war had ended. Instead, the airlift continued to expand until the end of the war, after delivering 650,000 tons of supplies, gasoline, and military equipment. Chennault was replaced as commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force by Lt. Gen. George E. Stratemeyer in June 1945. Following the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Chennault retired from the Army Air Forces on October 31, 1945.

==Postwar==
Chennault, unlike Stilwell, had a high opinion of Chiang Kai-shek and advocated international support for Asian anti-communist movements. Returning to China, he purchased several surplus military aircraft and created the Civil Air Transport (later known as Air America). The aircraft facilitated aid to Nationalist China during the struggle against the Chinese Communists in the late 1940s and were later used in supply missions to French forces in Indochina and the Kuomintang occupation of northern Burma throughout the mid- and late 1950s, providing support for the Thai police force. The same force supplied the US intelligence community and others during the Vietnam War.

In 1951, now retired, Major General Chennault testified and provided written statements to the Senate Joint Committee on Armed Forces and Foreign Relations, which was investigating the causes of the 1949 fall of China to the communists. Together with Army General Albert C. Wedemeyer, Navy Vice Admiral Oscar C. Badger II, and others, Chennault claimed that the Truman administration&#x27;s arms embargo had been a key factor in the loss of morale to the Nationalist armies.

Chennault advocated changes in how foreign aid was distributed and encouraged the US Congress to focus on individualized aid assistance with specific goals, with close monitoring by US advisers. Those viewpoints may have reflected his experiences during the Chinese Civil War in which officials of the Kuomintang as well as semi-independent army officers has diverted aid intended for the Nationalist armies. Shortly before his death, Chennault was asked to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee of the Congress. When a committee member asked him who won the Korean War, his response was blunt: &quot;The Communists.&quot;

On July 24, 1953, Chennault met with a number of former U.S. military officers, including Pedro del Valle and Bonner Fellers, to form the Defenders of the American Constitution (DAC). The DAC believed in a &quot;one-worldist conspiracy&quot; led by New York Jewish financiers who controlled international communism, and described their goal as the defense of &quot;the US constitution against enemies and encroachments, both foreign and domestic.&quot;

==Memoirs==
In 1949, Chennault published his memoirs, &quot;Way of a Fighter&quot;. The book covers his entire life but is especially detailed in recording his experience in China. The difficulties that he faced in modernizing fighter tactics, even in emphasizing airpower as a weapon, are clearly explained. His disagreements with and criticisms of the theater commander, General Joseph Stilwell, who was trained in the infantry and seen by Chennault as unappreciative of the capabilities of airpower, are a major portion of the memoirs. The book ends with his retirement from the Air Force and his return to China six months later to aid the nation&#x27;s recovery.

==Death==

Chennault was diagnosed with carcinoma (cancer) in his left lung in late 1957. The doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center said that the cancer, the result of years of smoking cigarettes, would kill him in six months. He and his wife took the opportunity to tour Europe one last time, and they landed in Taiwan in January 1958 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of CAT. Chennault was very weak, unable to cut the cake. He and Anna flew back to the United States.

Chennault was promoted to the honorary rank of lieutenant general in the U.S. Air Force on July 18, 1958, nine days before his death on July 27, at the Ochsner Foundation Hospital in New Orleans. His honorary promotion was authorized by a special bill of relief passed by Congress, likely the first of such bills for a retired USAF officer. A statutory waiver was required to promote a retiree like Chennault who was not otherwise on duty or eligible for promotion. He and Anna Chan are interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Chennault was twice married and had a total of ten children, eight by his first wife, the former Nell Thompson (1893–1977), an American of British ancestry, whom he met at a high school graduation ceremony and subsequently wed in Winnsboro, Louisiana, on December 24, 1911. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, long after his service in China started. He had two daughters by his second wife, Chen Xiangmei (Anna Chennault), a young reporter for the Central News Agency whom he married on December 2, 1947. She became one of the Republic of China&#x27;s chief lobbyists in Washington, DC.

His children from the first marriage were Col. John Stephen Chennault, USAF Ret. (1913–1977), Max Thompson Chennault (1914–2001), Charles Lee Chennault (1918–1967), Peggy Sue Chennault Lee (1919–2004), Claire Patterson Chennault (November 24, 1920 – October 3, 2011), David Wallace Chennault (1923–1980), Robert Kenneth Chennault (1925–2006), and Rosemary Louise Chennault Simrall (September 27, 1928 – August 25, 2013). John Chennault commanded the 343d Fighter Group, called the &quot;Aleutian Tigers&quot;, during the World War Two.

The Chennault daughters from the second marriage are Claire Anna Chennault (born February 8, 1949 – October 22, 2023) and Cynthia Louise Chennault (born 1950), a retired professor of Chinese at the University of Florida, Gainesville. As the State of Louisiana had passed an anti-miscegenation law in 1894 forbidding marriage between whites and non-whites, Chennault had been informed by his lawyer that his marriage to Anna was illegal in Louisiana, and to ensure his will was respected, Chennault—who lived in Monroe, Louisiana—had his will probated in Washington, D.C.

Claire P. Chennault, one of Claire Lee&#x27;s sons, was a U.S. Army Air Force and then U.S. Air Force officer from 1943 to 1966 and subsequent resident of Ferriday, Louisiana.

=== Freemasonry ===
Chennault was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, and he later was elevated to the 32nd degree in K.C.C.H. League City Lodge No. 1053, League City, Texas. He was also a Shriner.

==Legacy==
In December 1972, Chennault was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, along with Leroy Grumman, Curtis LeMay and James H. Kindelberger. The ceremony was headed by retired Brigadier General Jimmy Stewart, and a portrait of Chennault by cartoonist Milton Caniff was unveiled. General Electric vice-president Gerhard Neumann, a former AVG crew chief and the technical sergeant who repaired a downed Zero for flight, spoke of Chennault&#x27;s unorthodox methods and of his strong personality.

Chennault was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 40¢ Great Americans series (1980–2000) postage stamp.

Chennault is commemorated by a statue in the Republic of China&#x27;s capital, Taipei, as well as by monuments on the grounds of the Louisiana State Capitol at Baton Rouge and at the former Chennault Air Force Base, now the commercial Chennault International Airport in Lake Charles. The Chennault Aviation and Military Museum, located near the entrance to Monroe Regional Airport, and Chennault Park, also in Monroe, are also named in his honor. Nell Martien Calloway, named for her grandmother, Nell Thompson Chennault, and the daughter of Rosemary Simrall and Simrall&#x27;s first husband, Norman Hopkins Martien Jr. (1926–2012), is the director of the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum in Monroe.

A vintage Curtiss P-40 aircraft, nicknamed &quot;Joy&quot;, is on display at the riverside war memorial in Baton Rouge, painted in the colors of the Flying Tigers. In 2006 the University of Louisiana at Monroe renamed its athletic teams the Warhawks, honoring Chennault&#x27;s AVG Curtiss P-40 fighter aircraft nickname. A large display of General Chennault&#x27;s orders, medals and other decorations has been on loan to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., by his widow Anna since the museum&#x27;s opening in 1976.

For many years Chennault was viewed negatively within the People&#x27;s Republic of China, due to his role against the Communist forces during the Chinese Civil War. However, this changed following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the PRC and the U.S., with Chennault being viewed more positively. In 2005, the &quot;Flying Tigers Memorial&quot; was built in Huaihua, Hunan Province, on one of the old airstrips used by the Flying Tigers in the 1940s. On the 65th anniversary of the Japanese surrender, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and PRC officials unveiled a statue of Chennault in Zhijiang County, Hunan. The Kunming Flying Tigers Museum opened on December 20, 2012, on the 71st anniversary of the first combat in Kunming of the Flying Tigers. Chennault is among the &quot;foreign friends of China&quot; that Xi Jinping cites in his foreign policy discourses in an effort to recognize the contributions of other countries to China&#x27;s national liberation.

On October 7, 2015, Republic of China (Taiwan) president Ma Ying-jeou awarded a medal commemorating victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War to Chennault, which was accepted by his widow Anna Chennault.

Chongqing is also home to a Flying Tigers Memorial and Exhibition dedicated to Chennault and his aviators. It is opposite the former residence of General Stilwell.

<doc id="140775" wikidata="Q3520724" url="?curid=140775" title="The Electric Spanking of War Babies">
<text>The Electric Spanking of War Babies is the twelfth studio album by the American funk rock band Funkadelic, released in April 1981 on Warner Bros. Records. The title is an allusion to the Vietnam War and baby boomers. Sly Stone contributed to the recording sessions, singing lead vocals on &quot;Funk Gets Stronger (Killer Millimeter Longer Version)&quot;.

==Background==
Clinton originally planned on a double album, but the idea was quashed by Warner Brothers. The original tracklist featured the instrumental version of the title track found on the 12&quot; single&#x27;s b-side, as well as the tracks &quot;May Day (S.O.S.)&quot; and &quot;I Angle&quot;, later released on the George Clinton Family Series albums Plush Funk and Testing Positive 4 the Funk, respectively. The title refers to the US government&#x27;s use of media propaganda to promote imperialism and war.

It includes many relative newcomers to P-Funk, many of whom remained employed by George Clinton on future releases under his own name or under the name George Clinton &amp; the P-Funk All-Stars. Of all the original group members since Funkadelic&#x27;s debut album, only George Clinton, Ray Davis, and Eddie Hazel appear on this album. Junie Morrison plays all the instruments on the title track except the guitar solo which was played by Michael Hampton. This was the last Album to feature Eddie Hazel, Ray Davis, Garry Shider, Junie Morrison, Mallia Franklin, and Jessica Cleaves. Also this is the only Funkadelic album the late Roger Troutman appears on as well. Sly Stone performs several instruments and contributed production work to the album.

==Artwork controversy==
The cover artwork was designed by long-time Funkadelic collaborator Pedro Bell. Deemed inappropriate due to the cover featuring an overtly phallic spaceship that transported a naked woman, the work was edited, despite the fact that Funkadelic &quot;was following up two consecutive million-selling records,&quot; while signed to Warner Bros. Bell revised &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot; so the image was featured with a lime-green sketch of shape covering the majority of the cover art, which says, “Oh Look! The Cover that ‘They’ were TOO-SCARED to print!”

==Critical response==

*&quot;Whether or not one cares to examine its hidden political messages, Electric Spanking is an above-average party album.&quot;
**AllMusic
*&quot;George Clinton reaches into the disgusting depths of his drug-addled mind and comes up with the solidest, weirdest chunk of P-Funk since one nation gathered under a groove.&quot;
**Robert Christgau

<text>Serdar Argic () was the alias used in one of the first automated newsgroup spam incidents on Usenet, with the objective of denying the Armenian genocide.

==Usenet posts==
For a period of several months in the first half of 1994, the Internet user under the pseudonym of &quot;Serdar Argic&quot; (with the address sera@zuma.uucp) posted messages in any Usenet newsgroup thread involving the country of Turkey, arguing that the Armenian genocide had not occurred or that Armenians had committed genocide against Turks. Describing him in &quot;Net.wars&quot;, Wendy Grossman said:

Serdar Argic, who apparently managed to run a daily search on all of Usenet for mentions of Turkey, and followed up all such messages with lengthy and historically inaccurate diatribes about genocide against the Turks.

Argic&#x27;s postings soon numbered in the tens of thousands, and averaged over 100 posts per day, the highest post count of any single Usenet entity at the time. He posted to several newsgroups, especially soc.history, soc.culture.Turkish, and misc.headlines. Because of the posting volume, repetitiveness and minimal responsiveness to follow-up posts, most observers concluded that it was the output of a program, or &quot;bot&quot;, which scanned for any new appearances of the keywords &quot;Turkey&quot; or &quot;Armenia&quot; in certain newsgroups and replied with saved pages of political text. The bot would automatically post a reply even if the original message had simply mentioned a Thanksgiving turkey but was cross-posted to a soc.* group. The posts sometimes contained direct responses to specific statements, indicating some human intervention.

===Response===
Internet users sent complaints to UUNET, the Internet service provider hosting the account of Serdar Argic. UUNET never took any action based on the complaints, since Serdar Argic was posting from a host downstream from the host they fed (anatolia!zuma) over which they had no control. Serdar Argic became known as the Zumabot due to the name of his host.

Usenet messages can be cancelled, which prevents their further propagation. However, at the time, there was a fear of the free use of third-party cancellations, as it was felt they could set a precedent for the cancellation of posts by anyone simply disagreeing with the messages. Cancellations were rarely performed at the time, because spam was not the problem it became in subsequent years.

The Serdar Argic posts stopped in April 1994, after UUNET cancelled the subscription of anatolia.

==Popular culture==
Ken MacLeod referred to Argic in his novel &quot;The Star Fraction&quot; as a slang term for &quot;the lowest layer of paranoid drivel that infested the Cable, spun out by degenerate, bug-ridden, knee-jerk auto-post programs. Kill-file clutter.&quot; In his novel &quot;Accelerando&quot;, Charles Stross describes one character as &quot;a kind of Serdar Argic of intellectual property.&quot;

<doc id="140779" wikidata="Q475617" url="?curid=140779" title="Blainville-Crevon">
<text>Blainville-Crevon () is a commune in the Seine-Maritime &quot;département&quot; of the Normandy region of northern France.

==Geography==
A farming village situated by the banks of the river Crevon in the Pays de Caux, some northeast of Rouen, at the junction of the D12, D7 and the D98 roads.

==Toponymy==
Medieval place-name in &quot;-ville&quot; (from Gallo-Romance &#x27;farm, estate&#x27;). Mentioned as &quot;Bleduinvilla&quot; in 1050 - 1060. Probably &quot;*Bladwinus&quot; &#x27;estate, Germanic name &quot;*Bladwinus&quot; is never recorded, but belongs possibly to the developments of the anthroponymic element &quot;blad&quot;. A similar name can be recognized in Blainville-sur-l&#x27;Eau (&quot;Villa Bladini&quot; 10th century) &#x27;the estate of &quot;Bladinus&quot; &#x27;

Crevon is a former parrish (&quot;Chevron&quot; 1068–76, &quot;Kevron&quot; 13th century, &quot;Quevron&quot; → 16th). Crevon is the metathesis of the Norman &quot;Quevron&quot;, that is &quot;chevron&quot; &#x27;beam&#x27; in French, that is to say &quot;beam to cross the stream&quot;. The stream itself is now called Crevon. A aimilar Norman placename in Manche département is Hébécrevon, with the personal name Hébert (Herbert).

== History ==
It appeared for the first time in a charter by William the Conqueror referring to the Clères family feudal motte. Becoming the possession of the Mauquenchy family, Blainville became a true fortress and was subsequently confiscated by the English at the beginning of the Hundred Years War and again in 1435.

Later, it became the possession of Jean d&#x27;Estouteville, who restored the castle and founded the college. During the French reconquest of Normandy, Henry IV held a council of war at Blainville Castle on the eve of the fall of Rouen. The last owners, the Colbert-Seignelay family, demolished the old castle and built a château. The Chateau de Blainville was completely razed during the French Revolution.

Around 1820, the two neighbouring villages of St-Arnoult and Crevon were joined with Blainville to become Blainville-Crevon. 

It is a village of art, culture and history. A festival of world music named &quot;Archeo-Jazz&quot; takes place here annually at the end of June in the ruins of the medieval castle.

<text>Flora MacDonald (1722 – 5 March 1790) is best known for helping Charles Edward Stuart evade government troops after the Battle of Culloden in April 1746. Her family had generally backed the government during the 1745 Rising, and MacDonald later claimed to have assisted Charles out of sympathy for his situation.

Arrested and held in the Tower of London, she was released under a general amnesty in June 1747. She later married Allan MacDonald and the couple emigrated to North Carolina in 1773. Their support for the British government during the American War of Independence meant the loss of their American estates and they returned to Scotland, where she died in 1790.

==Early life==
Flora MacDonald was born in 1722 at Milton on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, third and last child of Ranald MacDonald (d. 1723) and his second wife, Marion. Her father was a member of the minor gentry of Clan MacDonald of Clanranald, being tacksman and leaseholder of Milton and Balivanich. She had two brothers, Angus, who later inherited the Milton tack, and Ronald, who died young. 

Particularly in the Hebrides, elements of the Clan Donald remained faithful, despite religious persecution, to the Catholic Church, but Flora came from South Uist&#x27;s Protestant minority. According to Scottish Episcopal Church Bishop Robert Forbes, &quot;Miss MacDonald is Protestant, and is descended from the family of Clanranald by her father, and of an Episcopal clergyman by her mother.&quot;

Through her uncle Maighstir Alasdair MacDhòmhnaill, Episcopalian Rector of Kilchoan and a Clanranald tacksman of Dalilea, Moidart, she was first cousin to Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair. Along with Sorley MacLean, the latter is considered one of the two most important figures in Scottish Gaelic literature.

Her father died soon after her birth and in 1728 her mother married again, this time to Hugh MacDonald, Tacksman of Armadale, Isle of Skye. MacDonald was brought up by her father&#x27;s cousin, Sir Alexander MacDonald, Chief of Clan Macdonald of Sleat. Suggestions she was educated in Edinburgh cannot be confirmed.

On 6 November 1750, she married Allan MacDonald, a captain in the British Army whose father was Sir Alexander&#x27;s steward, and tacksman of Kingsburgh, Skye. They had seven surviving children, two daughters and five sons, two of whom were lost at sea in 1781 and 1782; a third son John made his fortune in India, enabling his parents to spend their last years in some comfort.

==The escape of Prince Charles Edward Stuart==
MacDonald was visiting Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides when Prince Charles and a small group of aides took refuge there after the Battle of Culloden in June 1746. One of his companions, , was a distant relative of MacDonald, who asked for her help. Benbecula was controlled by an pro-government Independent Highland Company commanded by MacDonald&#x27;s step-father, Hugh MacDonald. This connection allowed her to obtain the necessary permits but she apparently hesitated, fearing the consequences for her family if they were caught. She may have been taking less of a risk than it appears, since witnesses later claimed Hugh advised the Prince where to hide from his search parties.

Passes were issued allowing passage to the mainland for Flora MacDonald, and a party of eight, including Charles disguised as an Irish maid called Betty Burke. On 27 June, they landed near Sir Alexander&#x27;s house at Monkstadt, near Kilbride, Skye. In his absence, his wife Lady Margaret arranged lodging with her steward, who told Charles to remove his disguise, as it simply made him more conspicuous. The next day, the Prince was taken from Portree to the island of Raasay, while MacDonald remained on Skye.

MacDonald was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. After Lady Margaret interceded on her behalf with the chief Scottish legal officer, Duncan Forbes, she was allowed to live outside the Tower under the supervision of a &quot;King&#x27;s Messenger&quot;, and released after the June 1747 Act of Indemnity. Aristocratic sympathisers collected over £1,500 for her, one of the contributors being Frederick, Prince of Wales. She allegedly told Frederick she helped Charles out of charity, and would have done the same for him.

==Emigration to North Carolina==
Following their marriage in 1750, Flora and her husband Allan MacDonald lived at Flodigarry on Skye. Allan served in the 114th and 62nd Regiments of Foot during the 1756 to 1763 Seven Years&#x27; War, and inherited Kingsburgh when his father died in 1772. The couple was visited here by poet, essayist, and lexicographer Dr. Johnson in 1773, whose words were later inscribed on her memorial at Kilmuir: &quot;a name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour&quot;.

However, a series of poor harvests and increasingly high rents resulted in what Johnson described as an &quot;epidemic desire of wandering&quot; throughout the Highlands in general. At the time of his visit in 1773, more than 800 people from the Sleat lands were preparing to emigrate to North America, and in 1774 Flora and her husband moved to Anson County, North Carolina. Along with other Clan Donald transplants, they settled near what is now Cameron Hill, on a plantation named &quot;Killegray&quot;. 

When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, Allan raised the Anson Battalion of the Loyalist North Carolina Militia, a total of around 1,000 men, including their sons Alexander and James. They then set off for the coast to link up with some 2,000 British reinforcements commanded by General Henry Clinton, who in reality had only just left Cork in Ireland. Early on the morning of 27 February, they were ambushed at Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge by Patriot militia led by Richard Caswell and along with his troops, Allan MacDonald was taken prisoner. 

After the battle, Flora MacDonald was interrogated by the local Committee of Safety. In April 1777, all Loyalist-owned property was confiscated and the MacDonalds were evicted from Killegray, losing all their possessions. After 18 months in captivity, Allan was released as part of a prisoner exchange in September 1777 and posted to Fort Edward, Nova Scotia as commander of the 84th Regiment of Foot. He was joined here by his wife in August 1778.

==Return to Skye==

After a harsh winter in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in September 1779 MacDonald took passage for London in the &quot;Dunmore,&quot; a British privateer; during the voyage, she broke her arm and ill-health delayed her return to Scotland until spring 1780. She spent the next few years living with various family members, including Dunvegan home of her son-in-law Major General Alexander MacLeod, the largest landowner in Skye after the MacDonalds. 

The compensation received for the loss of their property in North Carolina was insufficient to allow them to resettle in Nova Scotia and Allan returned to Scotland in 1784. Kingsburgh was now occupied by Flora&#x27;s half-sister and her husband, and Allan instead took up tenant farming in nearby Penduin. She died in 1790 at the age of 68 and was buried in Kilmuir Cemetery, followed by her husband in September 1792.

==Legacy==
Traditional portrayals of the escape focus on Charles, with MacDonald relegated to a secondary role. She herself rarely spoke of the episode, and her last contact with the Prince was when they parted ways at Portree. It appears her assistance was at least partly driven by fears his continued presence would endanger her family.

Michael Newton, a modern scholar of Scottish Gaelic literature, argues English-language versions fail to recognise that not only is her husband the celebrated iconic hero in the Gaelic oral tradition, but that, &quot;Flora was only one of many people who risked their lives to protect&quot; the Prince during his flight after Culloden. Her cousin, Gaelic poet Niall mac Eachainn, criticised her in verse for trying to win favour from both Stuarts and Hanoverians, while contrasting his own continuing loyalty to the Jacobite cause.

MacDonald was painted several times by Scottish portrait artist Allan Ramsay (1713–1784), most of which have now survived. The one used in this article was done after her release from the Tower in 1749–1750; in 2015, a previously unrecorded painting, allegedly also by Ramsay, was discovered in Florida.

Inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, the Victorian era created a Scottish cultural identity that co-opted &quot;romantic&quot; icons like Mary, Queen of Scots and Prince Charles. In 1878, MacDonald joined this list with the publication of an alleged &quot;Autobiography&quot;. Ghostwritten by her granddaughter Lady Flora Frances Wylde, it contains so many mistakes that it could not have been written by her. These errors were repeated by Charles Ewald in his 1886 book &quot;The Life and Times of Prince Charles Edward&quot;, which remains the basis for many popular perspectives on her life and motivations.

This was soon followed by the first performance of the Scottish highland dance known as &quot;Flora MacDonald&#x27;s Fancy&quot;, while a bronze statue was erected at Inverness Castle in 1896, with her dog Flossie by her side. 

The Flora MacDonald Academy, formerly Flora MacDonald College, in Red Springs, North Carolina is named for her. Two of her children are interred on the campus. Until 2009, it was also the site of the Flora Macdonald Highland Games.

==In popular culture==
===English literature===
* Inglis Fletcher, &quot;The Scotswoman&quot; (1954); a novel based on Flora MacDonald&#x27;s life in North Carolina during the American War of Independence.

===Film and television===
* In the 1948 film &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, Flora MacDonald is portrayed by Margaret Leighton, with David Niven as Prince Charles. Niven later recalled the film as &quot;...one of those huge, florid extravaganzas that reek of disaster from the start.&quot;
* Flora MacDonald was played by Shauna Macdonald in the &quot;Outlander&quot; television series, season six, episode five.

===Music===
* In 1884, Sir Harold Boulton composed English lyrics to &quot;Cuachag nan Craobh&quot; , a lament written by 18th-century Gaelic poet William Ross about his unrequited love for noblewoman Marion Ross. Under the title &quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot;, Boulton&#x27;s lyrics focus instead upon Prince Charles&#x27; escape to Skye, and proved extremely popular. 
* The Flask, a Dutch folkband, released the song Flora MacDonald in 2021, telling her story from saving Prince Charlie until her death.

<doc id="140782" wikidata="Q378088" url="?curid=140782" title="Prince William, Duke of Cumberland">
<text>Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland (15 April 1721 – 31 October 1765) was the third and youngest son of King George II of Great Britain and Ireland and his wife,
Caroline of Ansbach. He was Duke of Cumberland from 1726. He is best remembered for his role in putting down the Jacobite Rising at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which made him popular in certain parts of Britain. He is often referred to by the nickname given to him by his Tory opponents: &#x27;Butcher&#x27; Cumberland.

For much of the War of the Austrian Succession, with the assistance of John Ligonier, Cumberland commanded the main allied field army in Flanders acting in defence of the Austrian Netherlands and the Dutch Republic. At the head of the largest deployment of British troops on the continent since the days of Marlborough and opposed to the experienced French Marshal Maurice de Saxe, Cumberland&#x27;s campaigning could not prevent the fall of the Dutch Barrier Forts. Between 1748 and 1755 he attempted to enact a series of army reforms that were resisted by the opposition and by the army itself. Following the Convention of Klosterzeven in 1757, he never again held active military command and switched his attentions to politics and horse racing.

==Early life==

William was born in Leicester House, in Leicester Fields (now Leicester Square), Westminster, London, where his parents had moved after his grandfather, George I, accepted the invitation to ascend the British throne. On 27 July 1726, at only five years old, he was created Duke of Cumberland, Marquess of Berkhamstead in the County of Hertford, Earl of Kennington in the County of Surrey, Viscount of Trematon in the County of Cornwall, and Baron of the Isle of Alderney.

The young prince was educated well; his mother appointed Edmond Halley as a tutor. Another of his tutors (and occasional proxy for him) was his mother&#x27;s favourite Andrew Fountaine. At Hampton Court Palace, apartments were designed specially for him by William Kent.

William&#x27;s elder brother Frederick, Prince of Wales, proposed dividing the king&#x27;s dominions. Frederick would get Britain, while William would get Hanover. This proposal came to nothing.

==Early military career==
From childhood, he showed physical courage and ability, and became his parents&#x27; favourite. He was enrolled in the 2nd Foot Guards and made a Knight of the Bath, when aged four. He was intended, by the King and Queen, for the office of Lord High Admiral, and, in 1740, he sailed, as a volunteer, in the fleet under the command of Sir John Norris, but he quickly became dissatisfied with the Navy, and, instead secured the post of colonel of the First Regiment of Foot Guards on 20 February 1741.

==War of the Austrian Succession==
In December 1742, he became a major-general, and, the following year, he first saw active service in Germany. George II and the &quot;martial boy&quot; shared in the glory of the Battle of Dettingen (27 June 1743), where Cumberland was wounded in his right leg by a musket ball. After the battle he was made a lieutenant general.
In 1745, Cumberland was given the honorary title of Captain-General of the British land forces and in Flanders became Commander-in-Chief of the allied British, Hanoverian, Austrian and Dutch (known as the Pragmatic Army) troops despite his inexperience. He initially planned to take the offensive against the French, in a move he hoped would lead to the capture of Paris, but was persuaded by his advisors that this was impossible given the vast numerical superiority of the enemy.
As it became clear that the French intention was to take Tournai, Cumberland advanced to the relief of the town, which was besieged by Marshal Saxe. In the resulting Battle of Fontenoy on 11 May 1745, the Allies were defeated by the French. Saxe had picked the battleground on which to confront the British, and filled the nearby woods with French marksmen. Cumberland ignored the threat of the woods when drawing up his battle plans, and instead concentrated on seizing the village of Fontenoy and attacking the main French army nearby.

Despite a concerted Anglo-Hanoverian attack on the French centre, which led many to believe the Allies had won, the failure to clear the woods and of the Dutch forces to capture Fontenoy forced Cumberland to retreat to Brussels, where he was unable to prevent the fall of Ghent, Bruges and Ostend. Cumberland was frequently criticised for his tactics in the battle, particularly his failure to occupy the woods.

==Jacobite rebellion – &quot;The Forty-Five&quot;==

As the leading British general of the day, he was chosen to put a decisive stop to Prince Charles Edward Stuart, a grandson of James VII of Scotland and II of England (James VII/II was the last Stuart king on the male line), in the Jacobite rising of 1745. His appointment was popular, and caused morale to soar amongst the public and troops loyal to King George.

Recalled from Flanders, Cumberland proceeded with preparations for quelling the Stuart (Jacobite) uprising. The Jacobite army had advanced southwards into England, hoping that English Jacobites would rise and join them. However, after receiving only limited support, such as the Manchester Regiment, the followers of Charles decided to withdraw to Scotland.

Cumberland joined the Midland army under Ligonier, and began pursuit of the enemy, as the Stuarts retreated northwards from Derby. On reaching Penrith, the advanced portion of his army was repulsed on Clifton Moor in December 1745, and Cumberland became aware that an attempt to overtake the retreating Highlanders would be hopeless. Carlisle was retaken, and he was recalled to London, where preparations were in hand to meet an expected French invasion. The defeat of his replacement as commander, Henry Hawley, caused great panic in England in January 1746, when, under a hail of pistol fire, &quot;eighty dragoons fell dead upon the spot&quot; at Falkirk Muir.

===Culloden===
Arriving in Edinburgh on 30 January 1746, Cumberland assumed command of his forces and marched them to Aberdeen. There, he ordered them to undergo training for approximately two months in preparation for engaging the Jacobite Army. On 8 April, he set out from Aberdeen with his troops for Inverness; eight days later on 16 April, he engaged the main Jacobite army near the village of Culloden. In the ensuing battle, his army decisively defeated the Jacobites. The battle lasted only an hour, with the Jacobites suffering between 1,500 and 2,000 casualties, while approximately 300 government soldiers were killed or wounded.

On the morning after the battle, Cumberland issued a written order reminding his men that &quot;the public orders of the rebels yesterday was to give us no quarter&quot; and ordering his men to treat Jacobite wounded in the same manner. Cumberland alluded to the belief that such orders had been found upon the bodies of fallen Jacobites. However, for the two days after the battle, Cumberland&#x27;s order was not followed upon; though in the following two days, government troops scoured the battlefield and put to death many wounded Jacobite soldiers they came across.

Government forces subsequently embarked upon the pacification of Jacobite regions in the Scottish Highlands, which took several months. They carried out searches for rebels across the Highlands, confiscating property, destroying nonjuring Episcopalian and Catholic meeting houses and summarily executing numerous suspected rebels. While he had been in Inverness, Cumberland emptied the city jails of all of those who had been imprisoned by Jacobites and replaced them with Jacobites themselves; after the battle at Culloden, Jacobite prisoners were taken south to England to stand trial for high treason.

===&quot;Butcher Cumberland&quot;===

Following Culloden, Cumberland was nicknamed &quot;Sweet William&quot; by his Whig supporters and &quot;The Butcher&quot; by his Tory opponents the latter being a taunt first recorded in the City of London and used for political purposes in England. Cumberland&#x27;s own brother, the Prince of Wales (who had been refused permission to take a military role on his father&#x27;s behalf), seems to have encouraged the virulent attacks upon the Duke. Cumberland preserved the strictest discipline in his camp. He was inflexible in the execution of what he deemed to be his duty, without favour to any man. In only a few cases he exercised his influence in favour of clemency. The Duke&#x27;s victorious efforts were acknowledged by his being voted an income of £25,000 &quot;per annum&quot; over and above his money from the civil list. A thanksgiving service was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, that included the first performance of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot;, composed especially for Cumberland, which contains the anthem &quot;See the Conquering Hero Comes&quot;.

===Return to the Continent===

The Duke took no part in the Flanders campaign of 1746, during which the French made huge advances capturing Brussels and defeating the Allies at Rocoux. In 1747, Cumberland returned to Continental Europe. He again opposed the still-victorious Marshal Saxe and received a heavy defeat at the Battle of Lauffeld, or Val, near Maastricht, on 2 July 1747. This and the fall of Bergen-op-Zoom compelled the two sides to the negotiating table and in 1748 the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded and Cumberland returned home.

==Peacetime==
Cumberland&#x27;s unpopularity, which had steadily increased since Culloden, interfered greatly with his success in politics, and when the death of the Prince of Wales brought the latter&#x27;s son, a minor, next in succession to the throne, the Duke was not able to secure for himself the contingent regency. As a compromise, the regency was vested in the Dowager Princess of Wales, who considered him an enemy, but her powers were curtailed and she was to be advised by a committee of twelve men, headed by Cumberland.

===Attempts at army reform===
Whilst in the office of Commander-in-Chief, Cumberland attempted to reform the peacetime army with the support of his father. He wished to wrest control over promotions from the government to the army itself and to limit or curtail the practise of purchase. Cumberland further wished to create a special standing force which could be quickly deployed overseas in time of crisis. The Whigs, who only tolerated the army&#x27;s existence in peacetime and had confidence only in the commanders&#x27; control over the militia, saw the expansion and further professionalisation of the army as absolutist. Critics such as Horace Walpole argued the institution of purchase was one of the safeguards of parliamentary sovereignty against Royalist insurrection. Cumberland&#x27;s opponent in government Charles Townshend wished to instead further reduce the peacetime army and reform the militia by creating a volunteer force for home defence, a precursor to the volunteers of the 19th century which would be under the direct control of civil authorities.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==


===North America===

In 1754, the simmering colonial rivalry between Britain and France over competing territorial claims in North America developed into war. France asserted its claim to the Ohio Valley by building a network of powerful fortifications. The government ministry led by Newcastle initially proposed a limited military response, in which a Highland regiment supported by colonial forces would drive the French from the Ohio Valley. Cumberland believed the plan was not decisive enough to protect British interests in North America and expanded the plan to include a four-pronged assault against New France, with forces striking simultaneously at Duquesne, Crown Point, Niagara, and Beauséjour.

Cumberland proposed that only overwhelming force would defeat France in America, which was contradictory to Newcastle&#x27;s own proposals and previous government strategies which advocated limited offensive operations. Further, Cumberland proposed a role of commander-in-chief for forces in America, who would have the power to levy local troops and direct local strategy. A 3,500 strong mixed force of regulars, militia, and allied natives would be assembled. It would then cross the Virginia mountains and strike Duquesne. Two regiments drawn from Ireland were given this task. An officer who had impressed Cumberland on previous campaigns, Edward Braddock, was given command of all crown forces in America, to the surprise of many in the army as Braddock was relatively unknown.

Newcastle approved the bolder plan, which met with limited success. In his role as army Commander-in-Chief, Cumberland advised on the conduct of the war in North America. He believed the war should be principally conducted by the colonies themselves and that regular troops should only play a supporting role. He was influential in the appointment of Loudoun, another favorite and an officer who had served in Cumberland&#x27;s army during the Jacobite rebellion. Cumberland advised Loudoun to expose his officers and soldiers to scouting expeditions, so that they might &quot;learn to beat the woods&quot;. Cumberland approved the plan to develop light infantry in the British Army.

===Invasion of Hanover===
In 1757, the war having spread to Continental Europe, Cumberland was placed at the head of the Hanoverian Army of Observation, intended to defend Hanover (of which George II was Elector) from a French invasion. At the Battle of Hastenbeck, near Hamelin, on 26 July 1757, Cumberland&#x27;s army was defeated by the superior forces of d&#x27;Estrées. Despite seemingly having the advantage towards the end of the battle, Cumberland&#x27;s forces began to retreat. Within a short time discipline had collapsed, and Cumberland&#x27;s army headed northwards in total disorder. Cumberland hoped that the Royal Navy might bring him reinforcements and supplies which would allow him to regroup and counterattack, but the British mounted an expedition to Rochefort instead, despite suggestions that it should be sent to aid Cumberland.

By September 1757 Cumberland and his forces had retreated to the fortified town of Stade on the North Sea coast. George II gave him discretionary powers to negotiate a separate peace. Hemmed in by French forces led by the Duc de Richelieu, Cumberland agreed to the Convention of Klosterzeven, under which his army was to be disbanded and much of Hanover occupied by French forces, at the &quot;Zeven&quot; Convent on 8 September 1757.

On Cumberland&#x27;s return to London, he was treated badly by his father, despite the fact that he had previously been given permission to negotiate such an agreement. When they met, George II remarked &quot;Here is my son who has ruined me and disgraced himself&quot;. In response, Cumberland resigned all the military and public offices he held and retired into private life.

==Final years==
Cumberland&#x27;s final years were lived out during the first five years of the reign of his nephew, George III, who acceded to the throne on the death of William&#x27;s father on 25 October 1760. Cumberland became a very influential advisor to the King and was instrumental in establishing the First Rockingham Ministry. Cabinet meetings were held either at Cumberland Lodge, his home in Windsor, or at Upper Grosvenor Street, his house in London. Cumberland never fully recovered from his wound at Dettingen, and was obese. In August 1760, he suffered a stroke and, on 31 October 1765, he died at his home on Upper Grosvenor Street in London at age 44. He was buried beneath the floor of the nave of the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. He died unmarried.

On 20 July 1725, as a grandchild of the sovereign, William was granted use of the arms of the realm, differenced by a &quot;label argent of five points, the centre point bearing a cross gules, the first, second, fourth and fifth each bearing a canton gules&quot;. On 30 August 1727, as a child of the sovereign, William&#x27;s difference changed to a &quot;label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a cross gules&quot;.
==Legacy==

Prince William County, Virginia is named for him, as well as Cumberland County, Maine, Cumberland County, New Jersey, Cumberland County, North Carolina, and Cumberland County, Virginia. Various other places in the American colonies were named after him, including the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Gap and the Cumberland Mountains. In Britain, Cumberland Road in Kew and the Grade II listed Cumberland Gate into Kew Gardens are named after him.

In 2005 he was selected by the &quot;BBC History Magazine&quot; as the 18th century&#x27;s worst Briton.
A memorial obelisk was erected to the Duke&#x27;s military services in Windsor Great Park. It is inscribed &quot;THIS OBELISK RAISED BY COMMAND OF KING GEORGE THE SECOND COMMEMORATES THE SERVICES OF HIS SON WILLIAM DUKE OF CUMBERLAND THE SUCCESS OF HIS ARMS AND THE GRATITUDE OF HIS FATHER THIS TABLET WAS INSCRIBED BY HIS MAJESTY KING WILLIAM THE FOURTH&quot;. According to a local park guide and Scottish historian Murray Pittock, the obelisk was originally inscribed &quot;Culloden&quot; but Queen Victoria had &quot;Culloden&quot; removed.

An equestrian statue of the Duke was erected in London&#x27;s Cavendish Square in 1770, but was removed in 1868 since by that time the &#x27;butcher of Culloden&#x27; was generally reviled. The original plinth remained.

In 2019, plans by developers to name a street close to the battlefield after the Duke were rejected by The Highland Council.

<text>The Four Days&#x27; Battle was a naval engagement fought from 11 to 14 June 1666 (1–4 June O.S.) during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. It began off the Flemish coast and ended near the English coast, and remains one of the longest naval battles in history.

The Royal Navy suffered significant damage, losing around twenty ships in total. Casualties, including prisoners, exceeded 5,000 with over 1,000 men killed, including two vice-admirals, Sir Christopher Myngs and Sir William Berkeley. Almost 2,000 were taken prisoner including Vice-admiral George Ayscue.

Dutch losses were four ships destroyed by fire and over 2,000 men killed or wounded, among them Lieutenant Admiral Cornelis Evertsen, Vice Admiral Abraham van der Hulst and Rear Admiral Frederik Stachouwer. Although a clear Dutch victory, the surviving English ships were able to beat off an attempt to destroy them at anchor in the Thames estuary in early July. After quickly refitting, on 25 July the English defeated the Dutch in the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle.

==Background==
===Naval tactics===
The introduction of sailing ships with a square rig, of a type later called the ship of the line, which were heavily armed with cannon, brought about a gradual change in naval tactics. Before and during the First Dutch War, fleet encounters were chaotic and consisted of individual ships or squadrons of one side attacking the other, firing from either side as opportunities arose but often relying on capturing enemy ships by boarding. Ships in each squadron were supposed to support those in the same squadron, particularly their flag officer, as their first priority. However, in the melee of battle, ships of the same squadron frequently blocked each other&#x27;s fields of fire and collisions between them were not uncommon.

Although Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp had formed a line against the Spanish fleet in 1639 in the action of 18 September 1639, this was not a planned formation but a desperate attempt to hold off a greatly superior, but badly organised, enemy. The initial sea battles of the First Dutch War were largely indecisive melees, but later in that war Robert Blake and George Monck issued instructions for each squadron to stay in line with its flag officer. At the Battle of Portland Tromp&#x27;s attempt to overwhelm the English rear by concentrating his whole fleet against it and using his favourite tactic of boarding was frustrated by the English rear remaining in line ahead at the Battle of the Gabbard, the English fleet in line ahead forced the Dutch into an artillery duel that defeated their more lightly armed ships with a loss of Dutch 17 ships sunk or captured.

Between the first and second wars, the Dutch built the &quot;New Navy&quot;, some sixty larger ships with heavier armament, about forty cannon, although the shallow waters around the Netherlands prevented them building ships as big as the largest English ones: additionally, English ships of the same size tended to have more and larger guns than their Dutch equivalents. However, many of those the Dutch built were relatively small convoy escorts, frigates by English standards. It was intended to replace these by sixty heavier vessels but not all those planned had been completed or fitted out by the start of the war in 1665. At the time of the Second Dutch War, the English fleet also had a signalling system which, if still rudimentary, was better than the Dutch reliance on standing instructions to fight in line. In the Battle of Lowestoft and the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle, the English fighting in line ahead defeated the Dutch who did not. De Ruyter favoured the tactic of concentrating his attack on a portion of the enemy&#x27;s line, so achieving a breakthrough, and the capture of ships by boarding. However, in the Four Days&#x27; Battle the Dutch generally fought in line, and the English fleet did not do so, at important stages in the fighting.

From early in the 17th century, the Dutch navy had used fireships extensively, and in the First Anglo-Dutch War at the Battle of Scheveningen, Dutch fireships burned two English warships and an English fireship burned a Dutch warship. The Dutch in particular increased the number of their fireships after the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War but, at the Battle of Lowestoft, it was two English fireships that burned six Dutch warships which had collided and become entangled with one another. However, the limitations of fireships when used in open waters was demonstrated during the Four Days&#x27; Battle, where many were destroyed while trying to attack well-armed ships able to manoeuvre freely. The surrender of the English when attacked by several Dutch fireships after it had run aground because of the panic this attack caused only demonstrated that fireships were useful against warships that were stationary or in confined harbours, but not those able to move in the open sea. However, this overall lack of success in this battle did not prevent both sides adding more fireships to their fleets.

===War in 1665===

The Second Anglo-Dutch War arose from an escalation of existing commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands in 1664, involving English provocations in North America and West Africa. Although negotiations to avoid the outbreak of war took place throughout much of 1664, both sides refused to compromise on what they considered were their vital interests in these two areas and in Asia, and hostile acts by each side continued despite diplomatic efforts to avoid war. Louis XIV of France was intent on conquering the Spanish Netherlands and had signed a defensive treaty with the Dutch in 1662, with the intention of dissuading other countries from intervening if France invaded the Habsburg territories there. The existence of this treaty strengthened the Dutch resolve not to make significant concessions, as Johan de Witt believed it would prevent England declaring war. Charles II and his ministers hoped, firstly, to persuade Louis to repudiate the Dutch treaty and to replace it with an Anglo-French alliance, although such an arrangement would not assist Louis&#x27; plans for the Spanish Netherlands and, secondly, to strengthen English relations with Sweden and Denmark, both of which had significant fleets. Although neither plan succeeded, Louis considered an Anglo-Dutch war unnecessary and likely to obstruct his plans to acquire Habsburg territory., Charles&#x27; ambassador in France reported the French opposed such a war and this gave Charles the hope that, if the Dutch could be provoked into declaring war, the French would evade their treaty obligations which only applied if the Dutch Republic were attacked, and refuse to be drawn into a naval war with England. The war commenced with a declaration of war by the Dutch on 4 March 1665, following English attacks on two Dutch convoys off Cadiz and in the English Channel.
De Witt also achieved the completion of many new warships, with twenty-one ordered during the early stages of the war to augment the existing fleet and sixty-four planned in 1664, including several large flotilla flagships comparable in armament to all but the largest English ones. These had been given greater constructional strength and a wider beam to support heavier guns. Although several of these ships had not been available to the Dutch fleet at the Battle of Lowestoft, they had been completed and fitted out after it. The Dutch fleet had been confident of victory when it sought out and fought the English fleet in the Battle of Lowestoft in June 1665, but it suffered the worst Dutch defeat in any of the three Anglo-Dutch wars, with at least sixteen ships lost, and one-third of its personnel killed or captured. De Witt quickly saw that men were critical, not materiel: he sought to deal with the insubordination, lack of discipline and apparent cowardice among captains by executing three and exiling and dismissing others. De Witt also turned to de Ruyter, rather than Cornelis Tromp who had previously been given temporary command, to lead the Dutch fleet because of his seniority and political neutrality: de Ruyter assumed command on 18 August 1665 and he transferred his flag to the newly commissioned &quot;Zeven Provinciën&quot; on 6 May 1666.
Although the English had defeated the Dutch at Lowestoft, they failed to take full advantage of their victory. Despite the loss of ships and at least 5,000 men killed, wounded or captured, the escape of the bulk of the Dutch fleet frustrated the possibility of England ending the war with a single overwhelming victory. In another reverse to English hopes of an early and successful end to the war, the rich Dutch Spice Fleet managed to return home safely after defeating an English flotilla that attacked it at the Battle of Vågen in August 1665. The Dutch navy was enormously expanded through the largest building programme in its history. In August 1665 the English fleet was again challenged, though no large battles resulted. In 1666, the English became anxious to destroy the Dutch navy completely before it could grow too strong and were desperate to end the activity of Dutch raiders which threatened the collapse of English maritime trade.

After Lowestoft, English warships and privateers blockading the three main entry and exit points where Dutch merchant shipping concentrated, namely the Texel, the Maas river and off Zeeland temporarily paralysed Dutch overseas trade and weakened Dutch business confidence. The existence of five admiralty colleges, each with its own policies on ship construction and armaments, each favouring its local commanders and with variable levels of efficiency, and the reluctance of Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt to appoint Orangist officers, all led to difficulty in creating a unified navy.

At Lowestoft, the English Fleet was commanded by James, Duke of York, who was heir presumptive to his brother Charles II as well as Lord High Admiral of England. In view of the significant number of casualties among senior English officers and noble volunteers, including three killed next to the Duke, Charles insisted that his brother should no longer command at sea. The command of the English fleet was therefore entrusted jointly to Prince Rupert, a cousin of Charles and James, and the Duke of Albemarle.

===French intervention===
Louis had tried to act as mediator in July and August 1664 to prevent war being declared, but England did not accept his offer. After Battle of Lowestoft, and concerned that the complete destruction of the Dutch fleet would leave the English fleet in a position to interfere with his plans in the Spanish Netherlands, Louis again offered mediation, but as he had already sent French troops into the Netherlands to assist the Dutch, and had also attempted to bring Denmark into an alliance with the Dutch Republic and France that was designed to put pressure on England, his credibility as mediator was undermined. In response to its rejection of his mediation, Louis XIV declared war on England on 16 January 1666. The greater part of the French fleet was in the Mediterranean under the duc de Beaufort, and Louis intended that much of this would be brought into the Atlantic to join up with the Atlantic squadron commanded by Abraham Duquesne. The combined French fleet would then, it was intended, link up with the Dutch in the English Channel and the two would outnumber the English fleet.

Louis&#x27; plans were based on the assumption that the Dutch fleet would be at sea in time to be able to prevent the English fleet attacking the weaker French fleet in the western English Channel. However, the Dutch could not undertake to be at sea to provide cover for Beaufort until 21 May. As a result, Beaufort, who left Toulon in April 1666 with 32 fighting ships, delayed at Lisbon for six weeks while the Four Days&#x27; Battle was fought. Duquesne, who initially had 8 and later 12 ships, was ordered to join Beaufort at Lisbon so that the combined French fleet would be less vulnerable to a possible English attack before it could join the Dutch, although the two failed to meet and Duquesne returned to Brest while Beaufort stopped at Rochfort.

===Division of the fleet===

The French intention to bring the bulk of their Mediterranean fleet to join the Dutch fleet at Dunkirk was known to Prince Rupert by 10 May and discussed by Charles and his Privy Council on 13 May. The next day, two privy councillors were delegated to discuss the matter with Albemarle. The delegates recorded that Albemarle would not object to detaching a squadron under Prince Rupert to block the Strait of Dover, provided he were left with at least 70 ships to fight the Dutch. Rupert selected 20 generally fast or well-armed ships from the fleet and was instructed to collect any extra ships that might be available at Portsmouth or Plymouth. Rupert&#x27;s initial instructions were to attack Beaufort&#x27;s fleet, whose original 32 ships included several weakly armed, poorly manned or slow vessels. However, once it was known that Duquesne&#x27;s squadron was intended to join Beaufort, Rupert was instructed only to attack the French fleet if it was at anchor or was attempting an invasion, but otherwise to rejoin the main fleet as soon as he had encountered Beaufort or had credible information that the French fleet was not close enough to be a danger. In the event the French fleet did not appear.

Although Albemarle has been accused either of the responsibility for dividing the fleet or complacency for accepting the loss of Rupert&#x27;s squadron, it is clear that he counted on having at least 70 ships to face the Dutch fleet, even after Rupert&#x27;s squadron of 20 ships had been detached. When he spoke to the privy councillors on 14 May, the nominal strength of the fleet assigned to the joint commanders was over ninety, although at least a dozen of these had not joined the fleet at the mouth of the Thames and three ships then with the fleet later returned to port. Four of the missing vessels had been refitted but could not be fully manned in time to join the fleet, three were being repaired and five newly constructed ships which had been expected to join in May were delayed by difficulties in manning and victualing them. Much of the problem was that Charles II and his ministers had planned for a short war, but keeping a large fleet in being for a year after the partial victory of Lowestoft put demands on English public finances in 1666 that were almost impossible for it to meet.

Albemarle became increasingly concerned about the small numbers of ships under his command at the mouth of the Thames as May progressed, particularly after he received intelligence that the Dutch fleet was preparing to leave its harbours. He wrote three times between 26 and 28 May to the Navy Board and to Lord Arlington, one of Charles II&#x27;s Secretaries of State. In each case, he reiterated his commitment to fight the Dutch fleet with 70 ships but, as he had only 54 ships on 27 May and 56 ships on 28 May, he requested a decision on whether he had to fight a much superior Dutch fleet or could retreat. His final letter, to Arlington, amounted to him asking for specific instructions to decline battle if this disparity in numbers persisted.

The response from the Duke of York contained no instruction for Albemarle to decline battle if he had less than 70 ships, but left him discretion to make the decision. In part, this was because Charles and his ministers believed that the Dutch intended sail around the north of Scotland to join the French fleet before attacking the British fleet, so that Albemarle had time to increase the size of his fleet. However, the intelligence relied on was faulty and, at the start of the battle the English fleet of 56 ships commanded by Albemarle was outnumbered by the 85 warships in the Dutch fleet commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. Five ships joined Albemarle on 3 and 4 June, before the return of Rupert&#x27;s squadron.

On the day before the battle, the Dutch fleet comprised 72 large warships, 13 smaller warships classed as frigates, 9 fireships and an auxiliary force of 8 despatch yachts and twenty galleys, disposing of 4,200 guns and manned by 22,000 crewmen, constituting the largest and most powerful Dutch fleet up to that time. De Ruyter had been informed that day by a Swedish merchant ship that it had seen the English fleet, which it estimated at 80 ships, off the Kentish coast two days before.

==Battle==
===First day, morning===

Albemarle reorganised the squadrons of his fleet on account of the detachment of Rupert&#x27;s ships and made the consequent changes in flag-officer appointments at a council of war in 30 May. The next day, when the Dutch fleet was north of Nieuwpoort, de Ruyter also called his captains to his flagship to receive their final orders. When the Dutch fleet anchored that evening, it was only 25 miles from the English fleet. On the morning of 1 June, both fleets set sail early and, around 7am, some Dutch ships were sighted by the English fleet. During the course of the morning it became clear to Albemarle that there were at least 80 Dutch warships: he consulted his flag-officers and they decided that, as it would be difficult to withdraw into the Thames estuary with the Dutch in close pursuit, they would have to fight. However, as the high winds and rough sea were disadvantageous for fighting, they expected to do so only after the weather improved. Albemarle also sent a message to Rupert by the &quot;Kent&quot; to rejoin him if possible.

The weather conditions in the morning had caused the Dutch fleet to anchor, and around noon Albemarle, realising that the Dutch fleet was at anchor and unprepared, decided to exploit the opportunity to attack the Dutch rear squadron under Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp despite the adverse weather, in the hope it could be crippled before the Dutch centre and van could intervene. The English fleet was not in regular battle order, but at 12.30 Albemarle ordered it to attack, with his red squadron and George Ayscue&#x27;s white squadron mixed together in the lead and Thomas Teddiman&#x27;s blue squadron forming the rear. De Ruyter, who did not expect the English fleet would attack in wind and sea conditions in which many of its ships could not safely operate their lower gun batteries, was taken completely by surprise by this attack, but Tromp who was closest to the English fleet ordered his ships to cut their cables, and they sailed to the south-east, followed by the rest of the Dutch fleet.

The Dutch fleet had been anchored in a line running north east from Tromp in the rear to its van under Cornelis Evertsen the Elder, so only 30 or 40 ships of its rear under Tromp and some from its centre under de Ruyter could initially form a battle line against the whole English fleet. As the English fleet held the weather gauge, it could have pressed an attack on the initially outnumbered Dutch but many English ships failed to come into close action. This failure, and Tromp&#x27;s prompt action in getting his division underway, frustrated Albemarle&#x27;s attempt to put Tromp&#x27;s squadron out of action. After three hours during which neither side inflicted much damage in the other, Evertsen&#x27;s squadron started to come into action and, by sailing through gaps in the English blue squadron or crossing its wake, gained the weather gauge against that part of the English fleet.

===First day, afternoon===
By 5pm, the advantage of numbers had passed to the Dutch fleet, which was attacking the English blue squadron in the rear on both sides. Around this time, two Dutch ships caught fire, the &quot;Hof van Zeeland&quot; of Evertsen&#x27;s squadron and the &quot;Duivenvoorde&quot; of Tromp&#x27;s. Both were lost with most of their crews and two other Dutch ships had to deal with serious fires. Some survivors later claimed that these ships had been hit by &quot;fiery bullets&quot;, and a type of ammunition consisting of hollow brass balls filled with a flammable substance did exist, however other Dutch eyewitnesses thought that flaming wads from the two ships&#x27; own guns, blown back by the strong wind, had caused the fires.

As both fleets were heading for the shallow waters off the Flemish coast, and as his blue squadron was under heavy attack, Albemarle ordered ships of the red and white squadrons to wear to the northwest at around 5.30pm. Most of the red squadron saw the signal and wore in succession. The white squadron, with some red squadron ships in support, under Vice-Admiral Sir William Berkeley continued on a south-easterly course for another hour, as it had its own problems to deal with. By 6.30, Albemarle was leading the white squadron followed by the blue squadron northwest against Evertsen&#x27;s squadron sailing southeast and engaged it at close range. De Ruyter&#x27;s squadron facing no opponents, used the respite to make temporary repairs, and Albemarle and Evertsen&#x27;s ships did the same after passing each other.

To the southeast, Tromp&#x27;s ship &quot;Liefde&quot; was in collision with &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot;, and both fell out of line. Vice-Admiral Sir William Berkeley saw this as an opportunity to redeem his reputation, damaged by accusations of cowardice at Lowestoft, and attacked with his own ship, , with little support from other English ships Immediately, &quot;Callantsoog&quot; and &quot;Reiger&quot; came to the rescue of their commander, destroying the rigging of the English ship with chain shot; the &quot;Reiger&quot; then managed to board the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; after first being repulsed. Berkeley was fatally wounded in the throat by a musket ball, after which the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was captured. The ship&#x27;s lieutenant was found in the powder room with his throat cut; it was claimed that he had tried to blow up the ship but, after his own crew had drenched the powder, he had cut his own throat rather than being taken prisoner.

Two other ships from the white squadron shared the fate of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot;. The &quot;Loyal George&quot; had tried to assist the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; but was also captured and the damaged HMS &quot;Seven Oaks&quot; (the former &quot;Sevenwolden&quot;) was captured by the &quot;Beschermer&quot; The embalmed body of Berkeley, after being displayed in The Hague, was later returned to England under a truce, accompanied by a letter of the States General praising the Admiral for his courage. HMS &quot;Rainbow&quot;, one of the scouts who had first spotted the Dutch fleet, became isolated and fled to neutral Ostend, chased by twelve ships from Tromp&#x27;s squadron.

By 7pm, De Ruyter&#x27;s squadron had completed its repairs and it advanced with the support of Evertsen and Tromp to attack Albemarle&#x27;s ships, which had been reinforced by the white squadron. The reunited fleets twice engaged each other, with the Dutch fleet first sailing southeast then northwest, with the English fleet sailing in the opposite directions. One English ship, the &quot;Henry&quot;, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Harman, was badly damaged losing two masts and left behind when the rest of Albemarle&#x27;s fleet turned northwest. It was attacked by Dutch fireships after she had undertaken repairs and had tried to rejoin the fleet. The &quot;Henry&quot; managed to fight off three fireships although being set aflame and a third of her crew jumping overboard in panic. Harman refused an offer by Evertsen to surrender and a last shot at the Dutch ships barring the route to Albemarle cut Evertsen in two before &quot;Henry&quot; escaped to Aldborough.

As the two fleets drew apart and anchored for the night around 10pm, the Dutch could feel satisfied with having survived the attempt to cripple Evertsen&#x27;s squadron while at anchor or when it was outnumbered by the English fleet, and with having captured three English ships and forced three more out of the battle against a loss of two of their own to fire, although others on both sides were damaged and several Dutch ships had returned to port for repairs. The loss of Evertsen was also greatly mourned. However, Tromp had failed to anchor at the same time as the main Dutch fleet, and his squadron consequently lost contact with de Ruyter.

===Second day, Albemarle&#x27;s attack===
The morning of 2 June was sunny and warm, with a light south-westerly breeze. At dawn, de Ruyter had only 53 warships under his direct command, as Tromp with twelve others had been separated when night fell. Tromp came into sight soon after dawn but was some miles astern of the rest of the fleet when fighting started. Another twelve Dutch ships had chased the &quot;Rainbow&quot; towards Ostend and were missing for most of the day, and others on both sides had returned to port for repairs, leaving de Ruyter and Tromp with 65 ships to face Albemarle&#x27;s 48.

Albemarle made the understandable mistake of believing that the significant reduction in the size of the Dutch fleet in sight was the result of English gunfire, and attempted to destroy the Dutch fleet by a direct attack starting at 6am, initially sailing south in the hope of isolating Tromp, then to the southeast, with the main Dutch fleet moving northwest. At about 7.30, the two fleets began fighting at close range as they passed each other. During the morning, in light winds, the two fleets passed and re-passed several times, with ships from each side sometimes breaking through the other&#x27;s line during these passes: Tromp able to join the rear of the Dutch line during this period. Although the English fleet thought these were a reinforcement of new ships, about the same time Albemarle received a message that Rupert and his squadron were returning and would provide welcome assistance when they arrived 
The first two passes went badly for the English fleet, with HMS &quot;Anne&quot;, HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; and the hired &quot;Baltimore&quot; forced to return disabled to the Thames. After this, at about 10am, the wind died just as the two fleets had separated and they were becalmed for an hour. When fighting resumed, de Ruyter in crossed the English line which was sailing to the southeast, and gained the weather gauge. His intention was to abandon line ahead tactics and to make an all-out attack on the English, boarding and capturing their ships, and had ordered the red flag to be raised, to signal this intention.

===Second day, Tromp&#x27;s difficulties===
Before he could attack the enemy line, it became apparent to de Ruyter that Tromp and seven or eight ships of the rear squadron had not gained the weather gauge and were now isolated to the leeward side of the English red squadron without support, and under attack from ships of that squadron under vice admiral Sir Joseph Jordan. It is unclear whether Tromp had not had seen De Ruyter&#x27;s signal flags or had decided not to follow his orders, but within minutes six of his major ships, including his replacement flagship &quot;Provincie Utrecht&quot; had suffered major damage to their masts and were vulnerable to English fireships, which managed to burn his former flagship &quot;Liefde&quot;. The &quot;Spieghel&quot;, on which Vice-Admiral Abraham van der Hulst was killed by a musket shot, was attacked by three English ships of the red squadron and left disabled.

However, the remainder of Tromp&#x27;s ships were saved by de Ruyter who, with Vice Admiral Johan de Liefde, broke through the English blue squadron and drove off the English ships attacking Tromp while the rest of the Dutch fleet under Aert van Nes headed south, preventing the English blue squadron and the remainder of the red from joining Jordan in attacking Tromp. De Ruyter&#x27;s careful planning, keeping the centre and rear of the English fleet occupied while he rescued Tromp was in contrast to Berkeley&#x27;s impetuosity of the previous day. However, he had taken a considerable risk, as George Ayscue, seeing the de Ruyter and Tromp in a vulnerable position, had turned his white squadron north to try to isolate them. Ayscue was criticised for not pressing the disordered Dutch more closely, although his ships were also vulnerable to van Nes who had begun to turn north and could have joined de Ruyter quite quickly if the latter were attacked.

Tromp, switching to his fourth ship already, then visited de Ruyter to thank him for the rescue but found him in a dark mood. De Ruyter had been forced to call off his plan for an all-out attack in the English fleet so that Tromp could be rescued, during which time Vice-Admiral van de Hulst and Rear-Admiral Frederick Stachouwer had both been killed. The list of ships leaving the Dutch fleet was growing: the &quot;Hollandia&quot; had been sent home together with the &quot;Gelderland&quot;, &quot;Delft&quot;, &quot;Reiger&quot; &quot;Asperen&quot; and &quot;Beschermer&quot; in order to guard the three captured English vessels. Now the damaged &quot;Pacificatie&quot;, &quot;Vrijheid&quot;, &quot;Provincie Utrecht&quot; and &quot;Calantsoog&quot; had also to return to port. The &quot;Spieghel&quot; had to be towed by the less damaged &quot;Vrede&quot; and, the damaged &quot;Maagd van Enkhuizen&quot; left next day for the Netherlands.

De Ruyter&#x27;s fleet, reduced by its losses to 57 effectives, re-formed its line to face 43 English ships, some hardly effective, and both fleets now passed each other three times on opposite tacks. On the second pass &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; lost its main topmast and De Ruyter withdrew from the fight to supervise repairs to his ship, delegating temporary command to Lieutenant-Admiral Aert van Nes. He was later accused of attempting to pass the responsibility for any defeat in the uncertain contest to van Nes, but there was no established rule at that time about when admirals should change ships: Albemarle had remained on the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; the previous day when it anchored to refit during the fighting without his conduct being questioned. De Ruyter had strict detailed written orders from the States General to avoid unnecessary risks, to prevent a repeat of the events of the Battle of Lowestoft when the loss of the supreme commander had wrecked the Dutch command structure.

Van Nes commanded the Dutch fleet on its next three passes. As it held a leeward position, its guns had greater range which, with its superior numbers, made it clear by the early afternoon that the day&#x27;s outcome could be decided by attrition. Some English ships were dreadfully damaged, the merchantman &quot;Loyal Subject&quot; and another ship withdrew for their home ports and HMS &quot;Black Eagle&quot; (the former Dutch &quot;Groningen&quot;) raised the distress flag, but it sank from the many below-water shot holes it had suffered before any ships&#x27; boats could take off its crew. By 6pm, Albemarle&#x27;s fleet, reduced to 41 ships still in action, was near to collapse, with many ships badly damaged and with significant casualties, and some with little powder and shot left.

===Second day, Dutch reinforcements===
To add to the English troubles, in the late afternoon or early evening, a new Dutch contingent of twelve ships appeared on the southeast horizon. At the time, Albemarle believed that these were part of a fresh force, the English intelligence network in Holland having reported that the Dutch would retain a fourth squadron as a tactical reserve. Indeed, this option had been discussed but De Ruyter had just before the battle been convinced by the other admirals to use only three squadrons. In fact, the twelve were the ships of Tromp&#x27;s squadron that had chased the &quot;Rainbow&quot; into Ostend in the first day and were now re-joining the fight. Although it was clear this reinforcement could not join the Dutch fleet before dark, there was no question of the English fleet continuing the battle for a third day with only 35 ships, besides six badly damaged ones, when Rupert&#x27;s whereabouts were still unknown.

Albemarle gave the order to retreat. Fortunately, the English fleet was heading northwest and had passed the Dutch fleet heading southeast, so no major change of course was necessary to take the fleet north of the Galloper Sand and into the deep water channel leading into the Thames Van Nes had given the order for the Dutch fleet to tack in succession to begin another pass against their opponent before he realised that the English fleet were escaping. He decided not to rescind this order and replace it with one for all his ships to tack together, reversing the order of sailing, as this might cause confusion. This gave Albemarle a four or five mile head start, too much for the Dutch to overtake him before nightfall, as the sun had almost set and the wind was dying away. During his retreat, Albemarle placed 15 of his strongest and least damaged ships including his &quot;Royal Charles&quot; in line abreast as a rear-guard, and ordered the six most badly damaged to make their own way to port. The &quot;St Paul&quot; (the former Dutch &quot;Sint Paulus&quot;) had taken on too much water to keep with the other ships and was burned to prevent capture after its crew had been taken off.

Both sides had missed chances to strike decisive blows on the second day. First, Albemarle&#x27;s morning attack on the Dutch fleet, reduced by the absence of Tromp&#x27;s squadron, had been unsuccessful. Then de Ruyter could not have felt entirely satisfied, as had later been unable to launch his desired all-out attack on the English fleet because he had to rescue Tromp. Although this rescue prevented Tromp&#x27;s ships being overwhelmed, it and the failure van Nes to reverse the Dutch fleet quickly, lost the Dutch the chance of capturing many damaged English ships. The outnumbered English fleet had fought well and, although clearly defeated and in retreat, it had not been annihilated. However, it had only 28 ships that could be repaired and refitted for further combat. During the night, the two fleets lay becalmed about five miles apart making repairs.

===Third day===
A light breeze from the northeast replaced the overnight calm before sunrise, and the English fleet decided to continue its retreat, steering slightly north of west. Van Nes called a council of war, as de Ruyter was still far astern: this agreed to pursue the English fleet in line abreast and with the intention of engaging and overwhelming the English fleet, although it remained out of reach through the morning. By midday the wind strengthened and became easterly, so the fastest Dutch ships were released to try to overtake the English fleet. However, as the 15 ships of the English rearguard were all large and powerful, each with several large guns (32-pounder cannon) mounted in their sterns, whereas even the largest Dutch ships had only two medium-calibre guns that could fire forward, the English fleet was able to keep the Dutch ships at a distance, and continued on their way without difficulty.

Shortly before 3pm, Rupert&#x27;s squadron was sighted to the southwest by the leading English ships, heading north. When van Nes saw this, he tried to bring Albemarle&#x27;s ships into action before Rupert&#x27;s squadron could reinforce his fleet. Albemarle&#x27;s pilots assumed that both his fleet and Rupert&#x27;s squadron were already north of the Galloper Sand and, at about 5pm, they steered to the west to join Rupert. The leading English ships were small, and their shallow draught allowed them to pass over the Galloper Sand without difficulty, but , and grounded on the sandbank. The first two managed to get free quickly, but the larger &quot;Prince Royal&quot;, flagship of the white squadron, was stuck fast. It was soon surrounded by several Dutch ships, including two fireships. Vice-Admiral George Ayscue wished to resist any Dutch attack and begged his men to stay calm and repulse the approaching fireships. However, the crew panicked and a certain Lambeth struck the flag, forcing Ayscue to surrender to Tromp on the &quot;Gouda&quot;, the only time in history an English admiral of so high a rank was captured at sea. Tromp wished to keep the &quot;Prince Royal&quot; as a prize, and when de Ruyter finally caught up with his fleet at about 7pm, he initially raised no objection. However, when it floated as the tide rose, its rudder and steering were found to be damaged so it could not steer itself. As the recombined English fleet was preparing to attack, de Ruyter ordered the &quot;Prince Royal&quot; to be burned at once, as it was possible that an attempt would be made to recapture it. De Ruyter had explicit written instructions from the States-General to burn prizes in such situations. Tromp did not dare to make any objections because he had already sent home some prizes against orders; but later he would freely express his discontent, still trying to get compensation for the loss of this valuable prize in 1681.

After Rupert had left the main fleet on 29 May, Albemarle received information that a Dutch fleet which significantly outnumbered his had left its ports and was at sea. When this was passed to the king and his advisers, they sent Rupert an order for his squadron to return on 31 May: this reached him off the Isle of Wight on 1 June. His squadron reached Dover on 2 June but was delayed by light winds and adverse tides until the next morning.

Albemarle had only 27 ships remaining after the loss of the &quot;Prince Royal&quot; and sending six badly damaged ships to port. Rupert brought 26 ships, the 20 he had on 29 May together with &quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Hampshire&quot; which had been detached from the fleet before 29 May and four fireships. Three more ships from the Thames, the &quot;Convertine&quot;, &quot;Sancta Maria&quot; and &quot;Centurion&quot; also joined the fleet at the same time as Rupert. The English fleet therefore consisted of 52 warships, nearly half of them undamaged and with full crews, and six fireships facing some 69 Dutch warships, 57 major ones and the rest frigates, and six or seven fireships.

Soon after Rupert&#x27;s arrival, Albemarle convened a council of war which agreed to resume the battle in the following day, despite being weaker than the Dutch. Realising this, de Ruyter, who had resumed command from van Nes took his fleet eastward to make repairs and prepare for a fourth day of combat. De Ruyter considered that, despite the casualties suffered by many of his ships and shortages of ammunition, his superiority in numbers could still be decisive.

Albemarle and Rupert reorganised the English fleet. Rupert&#x27;s squadron of undamaged fast ships with fresh crews took the van as the new white squadron under his own command, with Sir Christopher Myngs and Sir Edward Spragge as his vice-admiral and rear-admiral. Sir Robert Holmes replaced the captured Ayscue in charge of the remains of the former white squadron, now consisting of between eight and ten of its original twenty ships. Holmes&#x27; ships probably formed part of the centre under Albemarle, although its exact position is unclear, and a reduced blue squadron under Thomas Teddiman, its vice-admiral, commanding in the absence of its admiral formed the rear. Like the Dutch, the English fleet spent much of the evening and night repairing damage as far as possible.

===Fourth day, first engagements===
The 4 June was cloudy with a brisk south-westerly wind. Both fleets had moved east of the Galloper Sand on divergent courses and were out of sight of each other at dawn, but English scouting ships soon found the Dutch to the south. When the main English fleet following the scouts was sighted, de Ruyter called his flag officers together to discuss a new arrangement for their nine divisions, with his own squadron in the van, de Vries (as successor to Evertsen) in the centre and Tromp in the rear. His intention was to break the English line in three places simultaneously rather than fight in line ahead. When the English fleet approached, sailing in a south-easterly direction, the Dutch had the weather gauge and sailed in line abreast in a northerly direction before forming line rather obliquely to the English fleet, so that only the Dutch rear and English van were initially within range of each other.

As on previous days, the fleets started by passing each other then reversing course. De Ruyter waited to exploit any gaps that might arise in the English line to carry out his plan of breaking through it, but about 7.30 on the second pass of the fleets, he was forestalled when Rupert&#x27;s squadron, sailing west, raced for the weather gauge against the leading Dutch ships under Vice Admiral Johan de Liefde with the &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; as his flagship. De Liefde&#x27;s immediate opponent was Vice Admiral Myngs on . Myngs&#x27; attempt to break the Dutch line was opposed by de Liefde trying to break the English one, but Myngs managed to force his division into the middle of de Liefde&#x27;s ships In close-quarters fighting, Myngs was shot and fatally wounded and the disabled &quot;Victory&quot; with three ships protecting it was forced to the north. The &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; was partly dismasted and unmanageable, but Rupert (who was intent on breaking the Dutch line) ordered his warships to stay in line and sent a fireship to burn it, although it only succeeded in setting fire to a Dutch fireship. The &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; was then sent to port as being too damaged to continue fighting. Rupert&#x27;s attempt to break the Dutch line succeeded as was larger and more strongly armed than any of de Liefde&#x27;s ships, and many others of Rupert&#x27;s and Albemarle&#x27;s ships followed through the gap it had created, or forced their own way through. However, Tromp&#x27;s rear squadron broke through Teddiman&#x27;s blue squadron, throwing it into confusion.

Seeing the danger to Teddiman&#x27;s squadron, both Albemarle and Rupert acted independently to reverse course and attack Tromp with superior numbers. Tromp could not continue on a south-westerly course, as Teddiman&#x27;s ships were in that direction: he had at most 12 to 14 ships, several of which were small, and could only withdraw to the north. While doing so, two of his ships collided and one the &quot;Landman&quot; was burned by an English fireship, which also damaged the &quot;Gouda&quot; severely. De Ruyter had achieved his objective of completely disrupting the English line by late morning, but his own fleet was also in disorder and so unable to take advantage of the confused English fleet.

After Tromp withdrew, gunfire ceased briefly while the disordered fleets tried to rearrange themselves to continue fighting. In the English fleet, Teddiman&#x27;s rear squadron had first to be brought into line. However, once the English battle line was completed, de Ruyter had at most 35 ships with him, and possibly fewer, to oppose it. Tromp, van Nes (who had decided to chase the four ships from Myngs&#x27; former squadron) and de Vries were all some distance away and the English fleet was between them and de Ruyter. The &quot;Victory&quot;, now commanded by its lieutenant, John Narborough, and its three consorts were attacked by Tromp and van Nes with around 25 ships but managed to manoeuvre to avoid capture and all survived the battle. De Vries ignored this contest, and attempted to rejoin de Ruyter.

Despite having possibly as few as 32 and certainly not more than 35 ships to fight as many as 48 English ones, de Ruyter had regained the weather gauge while Albemarle and Rupert were attacking Tromp. During the late morning and early afternoon, the two fleets passed and repassed each other. Albemarle made no attempt to keep de Vries from joining the main Dutch fleet, which he did around noon. During the successive passes, the English fleet with superior numbers and heavier guns attempted to close with the Dutch, but de Ruyter prudently kept his ships at such a distance that, on some passes, the English ships, some with their magazines depleted by the previous days&#x27; fighting, withheld their fire.

De Ruyter&#x27;s patience was based on the probability that some or all of van Nes and Tromp&#x27;s 25 ships would return to the main action, which they began to do on the lee side of the English fleet from around 3pm. In response, Albemarle with some 37 ships including Sprague&#x27;s division from Rupert&#x27;s white squadron concentrated on van Nes and Tromp while Rupert with around a dozen ships manoeuvred to hold off de Ruyter. Albemarle&#x27;s intention was to strike a decisive blow before his ammunition and daylight ran out.

===Fourth day, de Ruyter&#x27;s attack===

Albemarle and Rupert gambled that de Ruyter would remain to windward and at a distance, so that Rupert&#x27;s ships could hold them off for long enough for Albemarle to crush Tromp and van Nes. Albemarle attacked at close range and sent in a fireship, both of which caused confusion among the Dutch. Teddiman&#x27;s &quot;Royal Katherine&quot; so damaged Tromp&#x27;s &quot;Wapen van Utrecht&quot; that Tromp was forced to retire and was unable to return to action; the &quot;Dom van Utrecht&quot; was forced to surrender to the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; and several other ships were disabled. Albemarle&#x27;s policy prohibited his larger ships stopping to take possession of these captured or disabled ships, but he later claimed that his frigates should have set fire to them. Despite this, Albemarle had put a large proportion of the Dutch fleet out of action and his victory seemed certain.

De Ruyter, three miles to windward, looked on anxiously. He had been waiting for several hours for Tromp and van Nes to join him, but they had been routed in a few minutes. He later confirmed that he had thought he had lost the battle, but after consulting Vice Admiral Adriaen Banckert, he waited until Rupert&#x27;s squadron sailing east had passed his fleet sailing west then crossed Rupert&#x27;s wake sailing northeast towards Albemarle&#x27;s rear. At first, Albemarle thought that de Ruyter intended to link up with van Nes and escape with as many Dutch ships as possible, and his exhausted forces with little ammunition left did not move to oppose this manoeuvre.

De Ruyter&#x27;s unexpected attack, when Albemarle appeared to be on the point of destroying Tromp&#x27;s squadron, caused some British captains to lose their nerve, and things began to go badly for the English fleet. Rupert in the &quot;Royal James&quot; and his squadron at first assumed that de Ruyter was withdrawing and had started to make repairs; the masts and rigging of the &quot;Royal James&quot; in particular had been badly shaken. As soon as he realised that the Dutch were attacking Albemarle, Rupert ordered his ships to attack de Ruyter, who would be trapped between them and the main English fleet. Almost immediately, the &quot;Royal James&quot; lost its main topmast, its mizzen mast and several major yards: it was now disabled and the rest of the squadron, rather than continuing against the Dutch, withdrew to defend their flagship and tow it westward. Rupert later claimed that there was no other ship he could use as a substitute flagship, but eyewitnesses claimed there were.

Seeing this, de Ruyter realised that he could win the battle and raised the red flag as the signal for an all-out attack, concentrating on the English rear. Albemarle&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; had a damaged foremast and main topmast, and had suffered shot holes to windward, so Albemarle was unable to tack to assist the rear for fear of losing masts or flooding. He also believed that his captains, unnerved by the sudden change of fortune, would not tack at his signal unless the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; led them. Those English ships of Teddiman&#x27;s squadron and others in the rear that stayed in line were able to follow Albemarle westwards, as the Dutch were as short of gunpowder as their opponents, and aimed to board and capture them. The &quot;Rupert&quot; lost a mast, but managed to fight off her pursuers, however the Frisian Rear-Admiral Hendrik Brunsvelt captured the merchant &quot;Convertine&quot;, which was entangled with and the former Dutch HMS &quot;Black Bull&quot; which&#x27; later sank. Brunsvelt&#x27;s vice admiral, Rudolf Coenders in &quot;Groningen&quot; captured HMS &quot;Clove Tree&quot; (the former VOC-ship &quot;Nagelboom&quot;).

===Fourth day, English retreat===
Once the English rear had been subdued, de Ruyter led most of his fleet in pursuit of Albemarle and Rupert, hoping to prevent them joining forces. The English fleet maintained a westward course towards the deep water channel leading to the Thames estuary. Albemarle and Rupert later claimed that their initial aim of their withdrawal was to unite and, if necessary renew the fight the next day, but the poor condition of many ships and their lack of ammunition decided them to continue homeward. However, other English officers said that the Dutch pursued the retreating English fleet for two hours before deciding to retire back to their own harbours.

De Ruyter later claimed that he had called off the pursuit of the English fleet because of a thick fog which made navigation difficult, otherwise he would have followed the ships as far as their home ports. The deeply religious De Ruyter interpreted the sudden unseasonal fog bank as a sign from God, writing in his logbook &quot;that He merely wanted the enemy humbled for his pride but preserved from utter destruction&quot;. However, the fog was only temporary and de Ruyter had only around 40 ships under his immediate command, with others disabled and returning to the Netherlands or dealing with prizes, and Albemarle had almost as many, including several large vessels, which posed a significant risk to the exhausted Dutch fleet.

By the end of the third day de Ruyter had already secured strategic victory, as the loss of ships and damage to the remainder would have prevented the English fleet interfering with the Dutch East Indies trade or preventing a French fleet joining the Dutch. Even had he retreated on the fourth afternoon, as Albemarle and Rupert thought, he would only have conceded a limited tactical victory to the English fleet and preserved most of his own fleet. The dismasting of &quot;Royal James&quot; was an opportunity that de Ruyter seized, but his attack on Albemarle was still a considerable gamble that might not have succeeded if the rest of Rupert&#x27;s squadron had attacked him rather than withdrawing to the west.

==Aftermath==
===Assessment===

The biggest sea battle of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and in the age of sail was undoubtedly a Dutch victory although both sides initially claimed they had won. However, the Dutch fleet had found it difficult to overcome an English fleet that, for the first three days of fighting, was much weaker in numbers than it, and the Dutch had been in danger of defeat on the second and particularly the fourth day. The Dutch had also lost more men killed, mainly on the four ships that had been burned. The absence of the French fleet prevented the possible destruction of the English fleet, so the outcome is sometimes described as inconclusive. Although the Dutch adopted the tactic of fighting in line for the first time, it was not a complete success, as subordinate commanders and individual captains sometimes lacked sufficient discipline to fully exploit this new tactic. The Dutch victory on the fourth day was only won after De Ruyter signalled an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; attack which many of the Dutch were more used to.

Immediately after the battle the English captains of Rupert&#x27;s squadron, not having seen the outcome, claimed De Ruyter had retreated first, then normally seen as an acknowledgement of the superiority of the enemy fleet. Though the Dutch fleet was eventually forced to end the pursuit, they had managed to cripple the English fleet, at least temporarily, and lost only four smaller ships themselves as the &quot;Spieghel&quot; refused to sink and was repaired. However, the apparent ascendancy of the Dutch fleet after the Four Days Battle lasted only seven weeks, during which time many damaged English ships were repaired, several others that missed Four Days Battle completed their fitting out and joined the fleet, and a rigorous use of impressment powers ensured the English fleet was adequately manned

Around 1,800 English sailors were taken prisoner and transported to Holland. Many subsequently took service in the Dutch fleet against England. Those that refused to do so remained in Dutch prisons for the following two years.

===Later actions===

The Dutch leader, Johan de Witt, overestimating the scale of the Dutch victory, ordered de Ruyter to attack and destroy the English fleet while it was anchored in the Thames estuary, while 2,700 Dutch infantry would be transported to the Kent or Essex shores of the Thames to defeat any local militia. This two-pronged attack would, de Witt hoped, end the war in favour of the Dutch Republic. De Ruyter sailed on 25 June and reached the mouth of the Thames on 2 July. Two Dutch squadrons attempted to find a safe passage into the Thames but found the buoys and other navigational aids either removed or placed over sandbanks and a strong English squadron ready to dispute their passage. De Ruyter then decided to blockade the Thames in the hope that what he thought would be the weakened remains of the English fleet would be forced to face him and be destroyed.

Although the restored English fleet had reached numbers equal to de Ruyter&#x27;s fleet by the first week of July, 1666, Rupert and Albemarle waited until the ships being fitted out and manned joined, and sailed out of the Thames on 22 July. The Dutch fleet moved away from the shallow estuary, and the two fleets met on 25 July at the North Foreland in the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle. This was an English victory, although not as comprehensive as its commanders wished, because the bulk of the Dutch fleet was not destroyed, although it suffered heavy casualties. The Dutch were, however, demoralised and its commanders indulged in mutual recriminations. After this battle, while the Dutch fleet was being repaired an English squadron, during Holmes&#x27;s Bonfire entered the Vlie estuary and burned 150 out of a fleet of 160 merchant ships, inflicting severe economic damage on the Netherlands.

The French and the Dutch accused each other of failing to ensure that their respective fleets met as planned. Louis XIV blamed the Dutch for not having its fleet ready in March, which had caused him to delay Beaufort, and the Dutch believed that Louis never intended to risk his fleet in battle. However, on 1 September de Ruyter had anchored his fleet near Boulogne and could have joined Beaufort at Belle-Île, but he withdrew to Dunkirk on 8 September. Meanwhile, Beaufort had left Belle-Île and entered the English Channel reaching Dieppe on 13 September before turning back on finding de Ruyter had withdrawn, losing a new and powerful ship which was captured by four English ones. This ended naval and military cooperation between the two countries.

===End of the war===
In 1667, the English government was unable to finance a fleet as large and well-manned as that fitted out in July 1666, although such a strong one would have been needed to inflict a serious, and possibly decisive, defeat on the Dutch fleet. This and the Dutch success in the Raid on the Medway made peace inevitable. England had gone to war in the expectation of an early victory that would not overstretch its government&#x27;s fragile financial position, but both it and the Netherlands had put such unprecedented efforts into providing ships and men that no decisive naval victory was possible, and severe English financial difficulties and the Dutch need to resume unrestricted commercial activity created the conditions for peace without resolving all the underlying causes for the conflict

<text>Gregory Goodwin Pincus (April 9, 1903 – August 22, 1967) was an American biologist and researcher who co-invented the combined oral contraceptive pill.

==Early life==
Pincus was one of five siblings born in Woodbine, New Jersey, to immigrant parents of Russian Jewish origin. His father was Joseph Pincus, a teacher and the editor of a farm journal, and his mother was Elizabeth (), whose family had come from the region that is now Latvia. Pincus&#x27;s IQ was said to be 210, and his family considered him a genius.

==Research==

Pincus began studying hormonal biology and steroidal hormones early in his career. He was interested in the way that hormones affected mammalian reproductive systems. His first breakthrough came when he was able to produce in vitro fertilization in rabbits in 1934. In 1936, he published his experiments&#x27; results. His experiments involving parthenogenesis produced a rabbit that appeared on the cover of &quot;Look&quot; magazine in 1937. To create the in-vitro rabbit offspring, Pincus removed the ovum from the mother rabbit and placed it in a solution mixture of saline and estrone. Afterwards, he placed the &quot;fertilized&quot; ovum back into the rabbit. Pincus&#x27;s experiment became known as &quot;Pincogenesis&quot; because other scientists were unable to reproduce Pincus&#x27;s results. After he was misquoted in an interview, it was believed that his experiment was the beginning of the use of in vitro fertilization by humans.

In 1944, Pincus co-founded the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. He wanted to continue his research on the relationship between hormones and conditions such as (but not limited to) cancer, heart disease, and schizophrenia. By the end of the 1960s, more than 300 international researchers came to participate in the Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology.

Pincus remained interested in mammalian reproduction systems and began to research infertility. In 1951, Margaret Sanger met Pincus at a dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, the director of the Margaret Sanger Research Bureau and medical director and vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), and procured a small grant from the PPFA for Pincus to begin hormonal contraceptive research. Pincus, along with Min Chueh Chang, confirmed earlier research that progesterone would act as an inhibitor to ovulation.

In 1952, Sanger told her friend Katharine McCormick about Pincus and Chang&#x27;s research. Frustrated by PPFA&#x27;s meager interest and support, McCormick and Sanger met with Pincus in 1953 to dramatically expand the scope of the research with a 50-fold increase in funding from McCormick. Pincus was interested by Sanger&#x27;s work with impoverished women with histories of many pregnancies. Sanger indirectly influenced him to create a successful contraceptive to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

In order to prove the safety of &quot;the pill,&quot; human trials had to be conducted. These were initiated among infertility patients of John Rock in Brookline, Massachusetts, using progesterone in 1953 and then three different progestins in 1954. Puerto Rico was selected as a trial site in 1955, in part because there was an existing network of 67 birth control clinics serving low-income women on the island. Trials began there in 1956 and were supervised by Edris Rice-Wray and Celso-Ramón García.

Some of the women experienced side effects from the trial medication (Enovid), and Rice-Wray reported to Pincus that Enovid &quot;gives one hundred percent protection against pregnancy [but causes] too many side reactions to be acceptable&quot;. Pincus and Rock disagreed with Rice-Wray based on their experience with patients in Massachusetts and their research found that placebos caused similar side effects. Subsequently, trials were expanded to Haiti, Mexico, and Los Angelesdespite high attritionto accommodate rising interest. In May 1960, the American Food and Drug Administration extended Enovid&#x27;s approved indications to include contraception.

==Personal life==
Pincus married Elizabeth Notkin (1900–1988) in 1924 and they had two children together.

==Awards==
Pincus was the recipient of numerous awards for his research. He was awarded the Oliver Bird Prize in 1960; the Julius A. Koch Award in 1962; the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1966; and the American Medical Association’s Scientific Achievement Award in 1967. 

Pincus was acknowledged for his creation of the Laurentian Hormone Conference (which was a conference of endocrinologists). He served as the chairman of the conference, and its purpose was to discuss the hormones of the endocrine system. The conference was attended by endocrinologists from all over the world.

==Death==
He died in 1967 of myeloid metaplasia, a blood cancer, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 64 years old and lived in Northborough, Massachusetts. His funeral was held August 25, 1967 at Temple Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts.

==Lasting impact==
Pincus&#x27; birth control pill changed family life in a significant way, because it allowed women to choose—for the first time—when they would have children and plan accordingly around this decision in a deliberate manner. The birth control pill helped pave the way for the women&#x27;s liberation and concomitant Sexual Revolution movements.

<text>Grozny (, ; )&lt;ref name=BGN/PCGN&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the capital city of Chechnya, Russia. 

The city lies on the Sunzha River. According to the 2021 census, it had a population of 328,533 — up from 210,720 recorded in the 2002 census, but still less than the 399,688 recorded in the 1989 census. It was previously known as (until 1870).

==Names==
In Russian, &quot;Grozny&quot; means &quot;fearsome&quot;, &quot;menacing&quot;, or &quot;redoubtable&quot;, the same word as in Ivan Grozny (Ivan the Terrible). While the official name in Chechen is the same, informally the city is known as &quot; (&quot;), which literally means &quot;the city () on the Sunzha River ()&quot;.

In 1996, during the First Chechen War, the authorities of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria renamed the city Dzhokhar-Ghala (), literally Dzhokhar City, or Dzhokhar/Djohar for short, after Dzhokhar Dudayev, the first president of the republic, killed by the Russian armed forces. In December 2005, the Chechen parliament voted to rename the city &quot;Akhmad-Kala&quot; (after Akhmad Kadyrov) – a proposition which was rejected by his son Ramzan Kadyrov, the prime minister and later president of the republic.

==History==
===Russian fort===
The fortress of Groznaya (; &quot;fearsome&quot; – a feminine form of Grozny, as the word fortress, &quot;&quot;, is feminine in Russian) was founded in 1818 as a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River by general Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov. As the fort was being built, the workers were fired upon by the Chechens. The Russians found a solution by strategically positioning a cannon outside the city walls. When night fell and the Chechens came out of their hiding places to drag the gun away, all the other guns opened up with grapeshot. When the Chechens recovered their senses and began to carry away the bodies, the guns fired again. When it was over, 200 dead were counted. Thus did the &quot;fearsome&quot; fort receive its baptism of fire. It was a prominent defense centre during the Caucasian War. 

Russian poets Alexander Griboedov, Alexander Polezhayev, Mikhail Lermontov, the classic of Russian literature Leo Tolstoy, the Decembrist and writer Alexander Bestuzhev and other famous figures of Russian culture visited the fortress. After the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire, the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and on it was granted town status and renamed Grozny, as the word town, &quot;&quot;, is masculine in Russian. As most of the residents there were Terek Cossacks, the town grew slowly until the development of oil reserves in the early 20th century. The founder of the Nobel Prize, Alfred Nobel, took part in the development of the oil industry of the city of Grozny, as well as members of the Rothschild family. In addition to the Nobels and Rothschilds, British companies played an important role in the oil industry from 1893 onward. Alfred Stuart, an English engineer, completed the first well in Grozny by drilling in 1893 the largest oil field in the Caucasus region outside the Baku district. 

Eleven firms drilled 116 wells before 1900. This encouraged the rapid development of industry and petrochemical production. In addition to the oil drilled in the city itself, the city became a geographical centre of Russia&#x27;s network of oil fields, and in 1893 became part of the Transcaucasia–Russia-proper railway. The result was the population almost doubled from 15,600 in 1897 to 30,400 in 1913. In early 1914, the then largest oil company, Royal Dutch Shell, was established in the city thus making Grozny one of the largest industrial centres of the Caucasus. During the Russian Empire, the city was the administrative capital of the Groznensky Okrug of the Terek Oblast.

===Soviet regional capital===
One day after the October Revolution, on 8 November 1917, the Bolsheviks headed by N. Anisimov seized Grozny. As the Russian Civil War escalated, the Proletariat formed the 12th Red Army, and the garrison held out against numerous attacks by Terek Cossacks from 11 August to 12 November 1918. However, with the arrival of Denikin&#x27;s armies, the Bolsheviks were forced to withdraw and Grozny was captured on 4 February 1919, by the White Army. Underground operations were carried out, but only the arrival of the Caucasus front of the Red Army in 1920 allowed the city to permanently end up with the Russian SFSR on 17 March. Simultaneously it became part of the Soviet Mountain Republic, which was formed on 20 January 1921, and was the capital of the Chechen National Okrug inside it.

On 30 November 1922, the mountain republic was dissolved, and the national okrug became the Chechen Autonomous Oblast (Chechen AO) with Grozny as the administrative centre. At this time most of the population was still Russian, but of Cossack descent. As Cossacks were viewed as a potential threat to the Soviet nation, Moscow actively encouraged the migration of Chechens into the city from the mountains. In 1934 the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Oblast was formed, becoming the Chechen-Ingush ASSR in 1936.

Due to its oil, Grozny with Maikop were the main strategic objectives of the German Fall Blau operation in summer of 1942 (&quot;See Battle of the Caucasus&quot;).

The failure to take Grozny was a major defeat for Germany and was a factor in holding fast at the Battle of Stalingrad, as that city could have served as a base from which to take Grozny or cut off oil supplies up the Volga River from Astrakhan. The failure to prioritize Grozny, even transferring critical Panzer divisions north to the Siege of Leningrad, was a major factor in Adolf Hitler taking operational level control of the Wehrmacht from his generals who had repeatedly prioritized the two major cities over the oil supplies – against Hitler&#x27;s express orders. Soviet doctrine however never failed to prioritize the food of Ukraine nor the oil of the Caucasus, which resulted in drastic action after Germany&#x27;s expulsion/retreat in 1943.

In 1944, the entire population of Chechens and Ingush was deported after being falsely accused of collaborating with advancing armed forces of Nazi Germany. Large numbers of people who were not deemed fit for transport were &quot;liquidated&quot; on the spot, and the adverse situation with transport and the stay in Siberia caused many deaths as well. According to internal NKVD data, a total of 144,704 died in 1944–1948 alone (death rate of 23.5% per all groups). Authors such as Alexander Nekrich, John Dunlop and Moshe Gammer, based on census data from the period estimate a death toll of about 170,000–200,000 among Chechens alone, thus ranging from over a third of the total Chechen population that was deported to nearly half dying during those four years (rates for other groups for those four years hover around 20%). All traces of them in the city, including books and graveyards, were destroyed by the NKVD troops. The act was recognized by the European Parliament as an act of genocide in 2004.

Grozny became the administrative centre of Grozny Oblast of the Russian SFSR, and the city at the time was again wholly Russian. In 1957, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, and the Chechens were allowed to return. The return of the Chechens to Grozny, which had been lacking of Nakh for thirteen years, would cause massive disruptions to the social, economic and political systems of what had been a Russian city for the period until their return. This caused a self-feeding cycle of ethnic conflict between the two groups, both believing the other&#x27;s presence in the city was illegitimate. Once again migration of non-Russians into Grozny continued whilst the ethnic Russian population, in turn, moved to other parts of the USSR, notably the Baltic states, after inter-ethnic conflict broke out briefly in 1958.
According to sociologist Georgy Derluguyan, the Checheno-Ingush Republic&#x27;s economy was divided into two spheres – much like French settler-ruled Algeria – and the Russian sphere had all the jobs with higher salaries, while non-Russians were systematically kept out of all government positions. Russians (as well as Ukrainians and Armenians) worked in education, health, oil, machinery, and social services. Non-Russians (excluding Ukrainians and Armenians) worked in agriculture, construction, a long host of undesirable jobs, as well as the so-called &quot;informal sector&quot; (i.e. illegal, due to the mass discrimination in the legal sector).

At the same time a great deal of development occurred in the city. Like many other Soviet cities, the Stalinist style of architecture was prevalent during this period, with apartments in the centre as well as administrative buildings including the massive Council of Ministers and the Grozny University buildings being constructed in Grozny. Later projects included the high-rise apartment blocks prominent in many Soviet cities, as well as a city airport. In 1989, the population of the city was almost 400,000 people.

===Collapse of Russian authority===
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Grozny became the seat of a separatist government led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. According to some, many of the remaining Russian and other non-Chechen residents fled or were expelled by groups of militants, adding to a harassment and discrimination from the new authorities. These events are perceived by some as an act of an ethnic cleansing of non-Chechens, which has been reflected in the materials of General Prosecutor&#x27;s office of the Russian Federation.

This view is disputed by authors, such as Russian economists Boris Lvin and Andrei Illarionov, who argue that Russian emigration from the area was no more intense than in other regions of Russia at the time. According to this view of the ethnic situation in Ichkeria, the primary cause of Russian emigration was the extensive bombing of Grozny (where four out of five, or nearly 200,000 Russians in Chechnya lived before the war) by the Russian military during the First Chechen War.

The covert Russian attempts of overthrowing Dudayev by means of armed Chechen opposition forces resulted in repeated failed assaults on the city. Originally, Moscow had been backing the political opposition of &quot;peacefully&quot; (i.e. without supplying the opposition with weapons and encouraging them to try a coup). However, this changed in 1994, after the coups in neighbouring Georgia and Azerbaijan (both of which Moscow was involved with), when Russia encouraged armed opposition, and occasionally assisted. In August 1994 Avturkhanov attacked Grozny, but was repelled first by Chechen citizens who were then joined by Grozny government troops; Russian helicopters covered his retreat. On 28 September, one of these helicopters was shot down and its Russian pilot was held as a prisoner-of-war by the Chechen government. The last assault, on 26 November 1994, ended with capture of 21 Russian Army tank crew members who had secretly been hired as mercenaries by the FSK (former KGB, not long after renamed FSB); their capture was sometimes cited as one of the reasons for Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s decision to openly intervene. In the meantime, Grozny airport and other targets were bombed by unmarked Russian aircraft.

===First Chechen War===

During the First Chechen War, Grozny was the site of an intense battle lasting from December 1994 to February 1995 and ultimately ending with the capture of the city by the Russian military. Intense fighting and carpet bombing carried out by the Russian Air Force destroyed much of the city. Thousands of combatants on both sides died in the fighting, alongside civilians, many of whom were reportedly ethnic Russians; unclaimed bodies were later collected and buried in mass graves on the city outskirts. The main federal military base in Chechnya was located in the area of Grozny air base. 

Chechen guerrilla units operating from nearby mountains managed to harass and demoralize the Russian Army by means of guerilla tactics and raids, such as the attack on Grozny in March 1996, which added to political and public pressure for a withdrawal of Russian troops. In August 1996, a raiding force of 1,500 to 3,000 militants recaptured the city in a surprise attack. They surrounded and routed its entire garrison of 10,000 MVD troops, while fighting off the Russian Army units from the Khankala base. The battle ended with a final ceasefire and Grozny was once again in the hands of Chechen separatists. The name was changed to Djohar in 1997 by the President of the separatist Ichkeria republic, Aslan Maskhadov. By this time most of the remaining Russian minority had fled.

===Second Chechen War===
Grozny was once again the epicentre of fighting after the outbreak of the Second Chechen War, which further caused thousands of fatalities. During the early phase of the Russian siege on Grozny on 25 October 1999, Russian forces launched five SS-21 ballistic missiles at the crowded central bazaar and a maternity ward, killing more than 140 people and injuring hundreds. During the massive shelling of the city that followed, most of the Russian artillery were directed toward the upper floors of the buildings; although this caused massive destruction of infrastructure, civilian casualties were much less than in the first battles.

The final seizure of the city was set in early February 2000, when the Russian military lured the besieged militants to a promised safe passage. Seeing no build-up of forces outside, the militants agreed. One day prior to the planned evacuation, the Russian Army mined the path between the city and the village of Alkhan-Kala and concentrated most firepower on that point. As a result, both the city mayor and military commander were killed; a number of other prominent separatist leaders were also killed or wounded. Afterwards, the Russians slowly entered the empty city and on 6 February raised the Russian flag in the centre. Many buildings and even whole areas of the city were systematically destroyed. A month later, it was declared safe to allow the residents to return to their homes, although demolition continued for some time. In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth, with not a single building left undamaged.

===After the wars===
The federal government representatives of Chechnya are based in Grozny. Since 2003, the city has been rebuilt from scratch. Out of several dozens of industrial enterprises, three have been partially rebuilt – the Grozny Machine-Building Factory, the &quot;Krasny Molot&quot; (Red Hammer) and &quot;Transmash&quot; factories.

Although most of the city&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed during the war, the city&#x27;s sewage, water, electricity and heating systems have since been repaired, along with of roads, 13 bridges and some 900 shops. Before the war, Grozny had about 79,000 apartments, and the city authorities expected to be able to restore about 45,000 apartments; the rest were in buildings that were completely destroyed.

Railway connection was restored in 2005, and Grozny&#x27;s airport was reopened in 2007 with three weekly flights to Moscow. In 2009 the IAC gave Grozny&#x27;s Severny airport the international certificate after checking and evaluating the airport&#x27;s airworthiness. On 16 November 2009, the airport had its first international flight, taking pilgrims on Hajj to Saudi Arabia via a Boeing 747.

After four years of construction, the Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque was formally opened to the public on 16 October 2008, and is one of the largest mosques in Europe. In 2009, the city of Grozny was honoured by the UN Human Settlements Program for transforming the war-scarred city and providing new homes for thousands.

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Grozny is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of republic significance of Grozny – an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of republic significance of Grozny is incorporated as Grozny Urban Okrug. The city also serves as the administrative centre of Groznensky Municipal District, but not of the corresponding administrative district.

===City divisions===
For administrative purposes, the city is divided into four city districts: Akhmatovsky, Baysangurovsky, Visaitovsky, Sheikh-Mansurovsky.

==Culture and education==
Grozny is known for its modern architecture and as a spa town and although nearly all the town was destroyed or seriously damaged during the Chechen Wars, it has since been entirely rebuilt. It is home to Chechen State University and FC Akhmat Grozny, which after a fifteen-year absence from its home town returned to Grozny in March 2008. Also in Grozny is Chechen State Pedagogical Institute and Grozny State Oil Technical University.

==Transportation==
===Train===

The first train pulled into the Grozny Railway station on 1 May 1893.

===Trams and trolleybuses===
On 5 November 1932, the Grozny tram system was opened to the public, and by 1990 it was long, with 107 new Russian-built KTM-5 trams that it received in the late 1980s, and two depots. The Grozny trolleybus system began operation on 31 December 1975, and by 1990 was approximately long, with 58 buses and one depot. Both types of transport came under difficult pressure in the early 1990s, with frequent theft of equipment, staff not being properly paid and resultant strikes. A major planned trolleybus route extension to the airport was cancelled. 

With the outbreak of the First Chechen War both transport services stopped operation in November 1994. During the destructive battles, the tram tracks were blocked or damaged, and cars and buses were turned into barricades. The trolleybus system was luckier, as most of its equipment, including the depot, survived the war. In 1996 it was visited by specialists from the Vologda Trolleybus Company, who repaired some of the lines, with services planned to restart in 1997. However, after specialists left, most of the equipment was stolen. The surviving buses were transported to Volzhsky where they were repaired and used on the new trolleybus system there.

After the Second Chechen War, little of the infrastructure of either system was left. The Ministry of Transport of the Chechen Republic, created in 2002, decided not to rebuild the tram system (considered too expensive and no longer meeting the city&#x27;s needs, as it had by then lost half of its population). Rebuilding of the trolleybus system, however, is still under consideration.

===Airport===

The city is served by Grozny Airport.

===Sharing system===
In 2018 the &quot;Delimobil&quot; car sharing company officially provided the capital of the Chechen Republic with 30 Hyundai Solaris. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company.

In the same year the &quot;Delisamokat&quot; provided the city with 120 electric scooters and some scooter stations.

==Sports==

Grozny is home to Russian Football Premier League club FC Akhmat Grozny. After winning promotion by coming 2nd in the Russian First Division in 2007, Akhmat Grozny finished 10th in the Russian Premier League in 2008. The team still plays in the top tier. The club is owned by Ramzan Kadyrov and plays in the recently built city&#x27;s Akhmat Stadium. Ruud Gullit was the team manager from the beginning of the season 2011, but was later sacked by the club in June.

The city is also home to the Fort Grozny motor racing circuit, which opened in 2015.

==Geography==
The city is located along the Sunzha River, a major tributary of the Terek River. The city is located in a valley approximately 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of the main range of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. 
===Climate===
Grozny has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation peaks during early summer, where sunshine hours also peak.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

The First Chechen War, also referred to as the First Russo-Chechen War, was a struggle for independence waged by the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria against the Russian Federation from 1994 to 1996. After a mutually agreed on treaty and terms, the Russians withdrew until they invaded again three years later, in the Second Chechen War of 1999–2000.

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, Chechnya came under the control of a secessionist regime led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. Russian president Boris Yeltsin supported anti-Dudayev militias until 1994, when he launched a military operation to &quot;establish constitutional order in Chechnya&quot;. Thousands of Chechen civilians were killed in aerial bombings and urban warfare before Grozny was captured in March 1995, but a Russian victory was denied as efforts to establish control over the remaining lowlands and mountainous regions of Chechnya were met with fierce resistance and frequent surprise raids by Chechen guerrillas. Despite the killing of Dudayev in a Russian airstrike in April 1996, the recapture of Grozny by separatists in August brought about the Khasavyurt Accord ceasefire and Russia–Chechnya Peace Treaty in 1997.

The official Russian estimate of Russian military deaths was 6,000, but according to other estimates, the number of Russian military deaths was as high as 14,000. According to various estimates, the number of Chechen military deaths was approximately 3,000–10,000, the number of Chechen civilian deaths was between 30,000 and 100,000. Over 200,000 Chechen civilians may have been injured, more than 500,000 people were displaced, and cities and villages were reduced to rubble across the republic.

==Origins==
===Chechen Independance Struggles from the 18th to Early 20th Century===
Chechen resistance against Russian imperialism has its origins as early as 1785 during the rule of Sheikh Mansur, the first imam of the Caucasian peoples. Uniting various North-Caucausian nations under his command, Sheikh Mansur sought to repel Russian invasion and expansion into the region.

Despite intense resistance during the 1817–1864 Caucasian War, Imperial Russian forces defeated the Chechens, annexed their lands, and deported thousands to the Middle East throughout the latter half of the 19th century. 

Following the Russian Revolution and collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Chechen efforts to assert independence failed, and by 1922 Chechnya was incorporated into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) - the largest member state of the newly-formed Soviet Union (USSR). In 1936, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin established the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, within the Russian SFSR.

===Chechen Insurrection of 1940-1944 and Post World War 2 Ethnic Cleansing===

In 1944, on the orders of NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria, more than 500,000 Chechens, the Ingush and several other North Caucasian people were ethnically cleansed and deported to Siberia and Central Asia. The official pretext was punishment for collaboration with invading German forces during the 1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya, despite the fact that many Chechens and Ingush were loyal to the Soviet government and fought against the Nazis and they even received the highest military awards in the Soviet Union (e.g. Khanpasha Nuradilov and Movlid Visaitov). In March 1944, the Soviet authorities abolished the Checheno-Ingush Republic. Eventually, Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev granted the Vainakh (Chechen and Ingush) peoples permission to return to their homeland and he restored their republic in 1957.

===Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation Treaty===

Russia became an independent state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. The Russian Federation was widely accepted as the successor state to the USSR, but it lost a significant amount of its military and economic power. Ethnic Russians made up more than 80% of the population of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but significant ethnic and religious differences posed a threat of political disintegration in some regions. In the Soviet period, some of Russia&#x27;s approximately 100 nationalities were granted ethnic enclaves that had various formal federal rights attached. Relations of these entities with the federal government and demands for autonomy erupted into a major political issue in the early 1990s. Boris Yeltsin incorporated these demands into his 1990 election campaign by claiming that their resolution was a high priority.

There was an urgent need for a law to clearly define the powers of each federal subject. Such a law was passed on 31 March 1992, when Yeltsin and Ruslan Khasbulatov, then chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet and an ethnic Chechen himself, signed the Federation Treaty bilaterally with 86 out of 88 federal subjects. In almost all cases, demands for greater autonomy or independence were satisfied by concessions of regional autonomy and tax privileges. The treaty outlined three basic types of federal subjects and the powers that were reserved for local and federal government. The only federal subjects that did not sign the treaty were Chechnya and Tatarstan. Eventually, in early 1994, Yeltsin signed a special political accord with Mintimer Shaeymiev, the president of Tatarstan, granting many of its demands for greater autonomy for the republic within Russia. Thus, Chechnya remained the only federal subject that did not sign the treaty. Neither Yeltsin nor the Chechen government attempted any serious negotiations and the situation deteriorated into a full-scale conflict.

===Chechen declaration of independence===
Meanwhile, on 6 September 1991, militants of the All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP) party, created by the former Soviet Air Force general Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed a session of the Supreme Soviet of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with the aim of asserting independence. The storming caused the death of the head of Grozny&#x27;s branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Vitaliy Kutsenko, who was defenestrated or fell while trying to escape. This effectively dissolved the government of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Republic of the Soviet Union.

Elections for the president and parliament of Chechnya were held on 27 October 1991. The day before, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union published a notice in the local Chechen press that the elections were illegal. With a turnout of 72%, 90.1% voted for Dudayev.

Dudayev won overwhelming popular support (as evidenced by the later presidential elections with high turnout and a clear Dudayev victory) to oust the interim administration supported by the central government. He became president and declared independence from the Soviet Union.

In November 1991, Yeltsin dispatched Internal Troops to Grozny, but they were forced to withdraw when Dudayev&#x27;s forces surrounded them at the airport. After Chechnya made its initial declaration of sovereignty, the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Republic split in two in June 1992 amidst the armed conflict between the Ingush and Ossetians. The newly created Republic of Ingushetia then joined the Russian Federation, while Chechnya declared full independence from Moscow in 1993 as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI).

==Internal conflict in Chechnya and the Grozny–Moscow tensions==

The economy of Chechnya collapsed as Dudayev severed economic links with Russia while black market trading, arms trafficking and counterfeiting grew. Violence and social disruption increased and the marginal social groups, such as unemployed young men from the countryside, became armed. Ethnic Russians and other non-Chechens faced constant harassment as they fell outside the vendetta system which protected the Chechens to a certain extent. From 1991 to 1994, tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity left the republic.

During the undeclared Chechen civil war, factions both sympathetic and opposed to Dzhokhar Dudayev fought for power, sometimes in pitched battles with the use of heavy weapons. In March 1993, the opposition attempted a coup d&#x27;état, but their attempt was crushed by force. A month later, Dudayev introduced direct presidential rule, and in June 1993 dissolved the Chechen parliament to avoid a referendum on a vote of non-confidence. In late October 1992, Russian forces dispatched to the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict were ordered to move to the Chechen border; Dudayev, who perceived this as &quot;an act of aggression against the Chechen Republic&quot;, declared a state of emergency and threatened general mobilization if the Russian troops did not withdraw from the Chechen border. To prevent the invasion of Chechnya, he did not provoke the Russian troops.

After staging another &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; attempt in December 1993, the opposition organized themselves into the Provisional Council of the Chechen Republic as a potential alternative government for Chechnya, calling on Moscow for assistance. In August 1994, the coalition of the opposition factions based in north Chechnya launched a large-scale armed campaign to remove Dudayev&#x27;s government.

However, the issue of contention was not independence from Russia: even the opposition stated there was no alternative to an international boundary separating Chechnya from Russia. In 1992, Russian newspaper &quot;Moscow News&quot; noted that, just like most of the other seceding republics, other than Tatarstan, ethnic Chechens universally supported the establishment of an independent Chechen state and, in 1995, during the heat of the First Chechen War, Khalid Delmayev, a Dudayev opponent belonging to an Ichkerian liberal coalition, stated that &quot;Chechnya&#x27;s statehood may be postponed... but cannot be avoided&quot;. 

Moscow covertly supplied opposition forces with finances, military equipment and mercenaries. Russia also suspended all civilian flights to Grozny while the aviation and border troops established a military blockade of the republic, and eventually unmarked Russian aircraft began combat operations over Chechnya. The opposition forces, who were joined by Russian troops, launched a poorly organized assault on Grozny in mid-October 1994, followed by a second, larger attack on 26–27 November 1994. Despite Russian support, both attempts were unsuccessful. Chechen separatists succeeded in capturing some 20 Russian Ground Forces regulars and about 50 other Russian citizens who were covertly hired by the Russian FSK state security organization (which was later converted to the FSB) to fight for the Provisional Council forces. On 29 November, President Boris Yeltsin issued an ultimatum to all warring factions in Chechnya, ordering them to disarm and surrender. When the government in Grozny refused, Yeltsin ordered the Russian army to invade the region. Both the Russian government and military command never referred to the conflict as a war but instead a &#x27;disarmament of illegal gangs&#x27; or a &#x27;restoration of the constitutional order&#x27;.

Beginning on 1 December, Russian forces openly carried out heavy aerial bombardments of Chechnya. On 11 December 1994, five days after Dudayev and Russian Minister of Defense Gen. Pavel Grachev of Russia had agreed to &quot;avoid the further use of force&quot;, Russian forces entered the republic in order to &quot;establish constitutional order in Chechnya and to preserve the territorial integrity of Russia.&quot; Grachev boasted he could topple Dudayev in a couple of hours with a single airborne regiment, and proclaimed that it will be &quot;a bloodless blitzkrieg, that would not last any longer than 20 December.&quot;

==Initial stages of conflict==
===Initial conflict===
On 11 December 1994, Russian forces launched a three-pronged ground attack towards Grozny. The main attack was temporarily halted by the deputy commander of the Russian Ground Forces, General , who then resigned in protest, stating that it is &quot;a crime&quot; to &quot;send the army against its own people.&quot; Many in the Russian military and government opposed the war as well. Yeltsin&#x27;s adviser on nationality affairs, , and Russia&#x27;s Deputy Minister of Defense General Boris Gromov (commander of the Afghan War), also resigned in protest of the invasion (&quot;It will be a bloodbath, another Afghanistan&quot;, Gromov said on television), as did General Boris Poliakov. More than 800 professional soldiers and officers refused to take part in the operation; of these, 83 were convicted by military courts and the rest were discharged. Later General Lev Rokhlin also refused to be decorated as a Hero of the Russian Federation for his part in the war.

The advance of the northern column was halted by the unexpected Chechen resistance at Dolinskoye and the Russian forces suffered their first serious losses.
Units of Chechen fighters inflicted severe losses on the Russian troops. Deeper in Chechnya, a group of 50 Russian paratroopers was captured by the local Chechen militia, after being deployed by helicopters behind enemy lines to capture a Chechen weapons cache. On 29 December, in a rare instance of a Russian outright victory, the Russian airborne forces seized the military airfield next to Grozny and repelled a Chechen counter-attack in the Battle of Khankala; the next objective was the city itself. With the Russians closing in on the capital, the Chechens began to set up defensive fighting positions and grouped their forces in the city.

===Storming of Grozny===
When the Russians besieged the Chechen capital, thousands of civilians died from a week-long series of air raids and artillery bombardments in the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the destruction of Dresden. The initial assault on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1994 ended in a big Russian defeat, resulting in many casualties and at first a nearly complete breakdown of morale in the Russian forces. The fighting claimed the lives of an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Russian soldiers, mostly barely trained conscripts; the worst losses were inflicted on the 131st &#x27;Maikop&#x27; Motor Rifle Brigade, which was destroyed in the fighting near the central railway station. Despite the early Chechen defeat of the New Year&#x27;s assault and the many further casualties that the Russians had suffered, Grozny was eventually conquered by Russian forces after an urban warfare campaign. After armored assaults failed, the Russian military set out to take the city using air power and artillery. At the same time, the Russian military accused the Chechen fighters of using civilians as human shields by preventing them from leaving the capital as it was bombarded. On 7 January 1995, the Russian Major-General Viktor Vorobyov was killed by mortar fire, becoming the first on a long list of Russian generals to be killed in Chechnya. On 19 January, despite many casualties, Russian forces seized the ruins of the Chechen presidential palace, which had been fought over for more than three weeks as the Chechens abandoned their positions in the ruins of the downtown area. The battle for the southern part of the city continued until the official end on 6 March 1995.

By the estimates of Yeltsin&#x27;s human rights adviser Sergei Kovalev, about 27,000 civilians died in the first five weeks of fighting. The Russian historian and general Dmitri Volkogonov said the Russian military&#x27;s bombardment of Grozny killed around 35,000 civilians, including 5,000 children and that the vast majority of those killed were ethnic Russians. While military casualties are not known, the Russian side admitted to having 2,000 soldiers killed or missing. The bloodbath of Grozny shocked Russia and the outside world, inciting severe criticism of the war. International monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) described the scenes as nothing short of an &quot;unimaginable catastrophe&quot;, while former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called the war a &quot;disgraceful, bloody adventure&quot; and German chancellor Helmut Kohl called it &quot;sheer madness&quot;.

===Continued Russian offensive===

Following the fall of Grozny, the Russian government slowly and methodically expanded its control over the lowland areas and then into the mountains. In what was dubbed the worst massacre in the war, the OMON and other federal forces killed up to 300 civilians while seizing the border village of Samashki on 7 April (several hundred more were detained and beaten or otherwise tortured). In the southern mountains, the Russians launched an offensive along all the front on 15 April, advancing in large columns of 200–300 vehicles. The ChRI forces defended the city of Argun, moving their military headquarters first to surrounded Shali, then shortly after to the village of Serzhen&#x27;-Yurt as they were forced into the mountains and finally to Shamil Basayev&#x27;s ancestral stronghold of Vedeno. Chechnya&#x27;s second-largest city of Gudermes was surrendered without a fight but the village of Shatoy was fought for and defended by the men of Ruslan Gelayev. Eventually, the Chechen command withdrew from the area of Vedeno to the Chechen opposition-aligned village of Dargo and from there to Benoy. According to an estimate cited in a United States Army analysis report, between January and May 1995, when the Russian forces conquered most of the republic in the conventional campaign, their losses in Chechnya were approximately 2,800 killed, 10,000 wounded and more than 500 missing or captured. Some Chechen fighters infiltrated occupied areas, hiding in crowds of returning refugees.

As the war continued, the Chechens resorted to mass hostage-takings, attempting to influence the Russian public and leadership. In June 1995, a group led by the maverick field commander Shamil Basayev took more than 1,500 people hostage in southern Russia in the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis; about 120 Russian civilians died before a ceasefire was signed after negotiations between Basayev and the Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The raid forced a temporary stop in Russian military operations, giving the Chechens time to regroup and to prepare for the national militant campaign. The full-scale Russian attack led many of Dzhokhar Dudayev&#x27;s opponents to side with his forces and thousands of volunteers to swell the ranks of mobile militant units. Many others formed local self-defence militia units to defend their settlements in the case of federal offensive action, officially numbering 5,000–6,000 armed men in late 1995. According to a UN report, the Chechen Armed Forces included a large number of child soldiers, some as young as 11 years old, and also included females. As the territory controlled by them shrank, the Chechens increasingly resorted to classic guerrilla warfare tactics, such as booby traps and mining roads in enemy-held territory. The use of improvised explosive devices was particularly noteworthy; they also exploited a combination of mines and ambushes.

On 6 October 1995, Gen. Anatoliy Romanov, the federal commander in Chechnya at the time, was critically injured and paralyzed in a bomb blast in Grozny. Suspicion of responsibility for the attack fell on rogue elements of the Russian military, as the attack destroyed hopes for a permanent ceasefire based on the developing trust between Gen. Romanov and the ChRI Chief of Staff Aslan Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet Army; in August, the two went to southern Chechnya to try to convince the local commanders to release Russian prisoners. In February 1996, federal and pro-Russian Chechen forces in Grozny opened fire on a massive pro-independence peace march of tens of thousands of people, killing a number of demonstrators. The ruins of the presidential palace, the symbol of Chechen independence, were then demolished two days later.

==Continuation of the conflict and mounting Russian defeats==
===Growing Russian defeats and unpopularity in Russia===

On 6 March 1996, a group of Chechen fighters infiltrated Grozny and launched a three-day surprise raid on the city, taking most of it and capturing caches of weapons and ammunition. During the battle, much of the Russian troops were wiped out, with most of them surrendering or routing. After two columns of Russian reinforcements were destroyed on the roads leading to the city, Russian troops eventually gave up on trying to reach the trapped soldiers in the city. Chechen fighters subsequently withdrew from the city on orders from the high command. In the same month in March, Chechen fighters and Russian federal troops clashed near the village of Samashki. The losses on the Russian side amounted to 28 killed and 116 wounded. 

On April 16, a month after the initial conflict, Chechen fighters successfully carried out an ambush near Shatoy, wiping out an entire Russian armored column resulting in losses up to 220 soldiers killed in action. In another attack near Vedeno, at least 28 Russian soldiers were killed in action.

As military defeats and growing casualties made the war more and more unpopular in Russia, and as the 1996 presidential elections neared, Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s government sought a way out of the conflict. Although a Russian guided missile attack assassinated the Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev on 21 April 1996. Yeltsin even officially declared &quot;victory&quot; in Grozny on 28 May 1996, after a new temporary ceasefire was signed with the Chechen acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev. While the political leaders were discussing the ceasefire and peace negotiations, Russian forces continued to conduct combat operations. On 6 August 1996, three days before Yeltsin was to be inaugurated for his second term as Russian president and when most of the Russian troops were moved south due to what was planned as their final offensive against remaining mountainous Chechen strongholds, the Chechens subsequently launched another surprise attack on Grozny.

===Third Battle of Grozny and the Khasavyurt Accord===

Despite Russian troops in and around Grozny numbering approximately 12,000, more than 1,500 Chechen guerrillas (whose numbers soon swelled) overran the key districts within hours in an operation prepared and led by Aslan Maskhadov (who named it Operation Zero) and Shamil Basayev (who called it Operation Jihad). The fighters then laid siege to the Russian posts and bases and the government compound in the city centre, while a number of Chechens deemed to be Russian collaborators were rounded up, detained and, in some cases, executed. At the same time, Russian troops in the cities of Argun and Gudermes were also surrounded in their garrisons. Several attempts by the armored columns to rescue the units trapped in Grozny were repelled with heavy Russian casualties (the 276th Motorized Regiment of 900 men suffered 50% casualties in a two-day attempt to reach the city centre). Russian military officials said that more than 200 soldiers had been killed and nearly 800 wounded in five days of fighting, and that an unknown number were missing; Chechens put the number of Russian dead at close to 1,000. Thousands of troops were either taken prisoner or surrounded and largely disarmed, their heavy weapons and ammunition commandeered by Chechen fighters.

On 19 August, despite the presence of 50,000 to 200,000 Chechen civilians and thousands of federal servicemen in Grozny, the Russian commander Konstantin Pulikovsky gave an ultimatum for Chechen fighters to leave the city within 48 hours, or else it would be leveled in a massive aerial and artillery bombardment. He stated that federal forces would use strategic bombers (not used in Chechnya up to this point) and ballistic missiles. This announcement was followed by chaotic scenes of panic as civilians tried to flee before the army carried out its threat, with parts of the city ablaze and falling shells scattering refugee columns. The bombardment was however soon halted by the ceasefire brokered by General Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin&#x27;s national security adviser, on 22 August. Gen. Lebed called the ultimatum, issued by General Pulikovsky (replaced by then), a &quot;bad joke&quot;.

During eight hours of subsequent talks, Lebed and Maskhadov drafted and signed the Khasavyurt Accord on 31 August 1996. It included: technical aspects of demilitarization, the withdrawal of both sides&#x27; forces from Grozny, the creation of joint headquarters to preclude looting in the city, the withdrawal of all federal forces from Chechnya by 31 December 1996, and a stipulation that any agreement on the relations between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the Russian federal government need not be signed until late 2001.

==Human rights violations and war crimes==

Human rights organizations accused Russian forces of engaging in indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force whenever they encountered resistance, resulting in numerous civilian deaths. (According to Human Rights Watch, Russian artillery and rocket attacks killed at least 267 civilians during the December 1995 raid by the Chechens on the city of Gudermes.) Throughout the span of the first Chechen war, Russian forces have been accused by human rights organizations of starting a brutal war with total disregard for humanitarian law, causing tens of thousands of unnecessary civilian casualties among the Chechen population. The main strategy in the Russian war effort had been to use heavy artillery and air strikes leading to numerous indiscriminate attacks on civilians. This has led to Western and Chechen sources calling the Russian strategy deliberate terror bombing on parts of Russia. According to Human Rights Watch, the campaign was &quot;unparalleled in the area since World War II for its scope and destructiveness, followed by months of indiscriminate and targeted fire against civilians&quot;. Due to ethnic Chechens in Grozny seeking refuge among their respective &quot;teips&quot; in the surrounding villages of the countryside, a high proportion of initial civilian casualties were inflicted against ethnic Russians who were unable to find viable escape routes. The villages were also attacked from the first weeks of the conflict (Russian cluster bombs, for example, killed at least 55 civilians during the 3 January 1995 Shali cluster bomb attack).

Russian soldiers often prevented civilians from evacuating areas of imminent danger and prevented humanitarian organizations from assisting civilians in need. It was widely alleged that Russian troops, especially those belonging to the Internal Troops (MVD), committed numerous and in part systematic acts of torture and summary executions on Chechen civilians; they were often linked to &quot;zachistka&quot; (&quot;cleansing&quot; raids on town districts and villages suspected of harboring &quot;boyeviki&quot; – militants). Humanitarian and aid groups chronicled persistent patterns of Russian soldiers killing, raping and looting civilians at random, often in disregard of their nationality. Chechen fighters took hostages on a massive scale, kidnapped or killed Chechens considered to be collaborators and mistreated civilian captives and federal prisoners of war (especially pilots). Russian federal forces kidnapped hostages for ransom and used human shields for cover during the fighting and movement of troops (for example, a group of surrounded Russian troops took approximately 500 civilian hostages at Grozny&#x27;s 9th Municipal Hospital).
The violations committed by members of the Russian forces were usually tolerated by their superiors and were not punished even when investigated (the story of Vladimir Glebov serving as an example of such policy). Television and newspaper accounts widely reported largely uncensored images of the carnage to the Russian public. The Russian media coverage partially precipitated a loss of public confidence in the government and a steep decline in President Yeltsin&#x27;s popularity. Chechnya was one of the heaviest burdens on Yeltsin&#x27;s 1996 presidential election campaign. The protracted war in Chechnya, especially many reports of extreme violence against civilians, ignited fear and contempt of Russia among other ethnic groups in the federation. One of the most notable war crimes committed by the Russian army is the Samashki massacre, in which it is estimated that up to 300 civilians died during the attack. Russian forces conducted an operation of zachistka, house-by-house searches throughout the entire village. Federal soldiers deliberately and arbitrarily attacked civilians and civilian dwellings in Samashki by shooting residents and burning houses with flame-throwers. They wantonly opened fire or threw grenades into basements where residents, mostly women, elderly persons and children, had been hiding. Russian troops intentionally burned many bodies, either by throwing the bodies into burning houses or by setting them on fire. A Chechen surgeon, Khassan Baiev, treated wounded in Samashki immediately after the operation and described the scene in his book:
Dozens of charred corpses of women and children lay in the courtyard of the mosque, which had been destroyed. The first thing my eye fell on was the burned body of a baby, lying in fetal position... A wild-eyed woman emerged from a burned-out house holding a dead baby. Trucks with bodies piled in the back rolled through the streets on the way to the cemetery.

While treating the wounded, I heard stories of young men – gagged and trussed up – dragged with chains behind personnel carriers. I heard of Russian aviators who threw Chechen prisoners, screaming, out their helicopters. There were rapes, but it was hard to know how many because women were too ashamed to report them. One girl was raped in front of her father. I heard of one case in which the mercenary grabbed a newborn baby, threw it among each other like a ball, then shot it dead in the air.

Leaving the village for the hospital in Grozny, I passed a Russian armored personnel carrier with the word SAMASHKI written on its side in bold, black letters. I looked in my rearview mirror and to my horror saw a human skull mounted on the front of the vehicle. The bones were white; someone must have boiled the skull to remove the flesh.
Major Vyacheslav Izmailov is said to have rescued at least 174 people from captivity on both sides in the war, was later involved in the tracing of missing persons after the war and in 2021 won the hero&#x27;s prize at the Stalker Human Rights Film Festival in Moscow.

==Spread of the war==

The declaration by Chechnya&#x27;s Chief Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov that the ChRI was waging a &quot;Jihad&quot; (&quot;struggle&quot;) against Russia raised the spectre that Jihadis from other regions and even outside Russia would enter the war. 

Limited fighting occurred in the neighbouring a small republic of Ingushetia, mostly when Russian commanders sent troops over the border in pursuit of Chechen fighters, while as many as 200,000 refugees (from Chechnya and the conflict in North Ossetia) strained Ingushetia&#x27;s already weak economy. On several occasions, Ingush president Ruslan Aushev protested incursions by Russian soldiers and even threatened to sue the Russian Ministry of Defence for damages inflicted, recalling how the federal forces previously assisted in the expulsion of the Ingush population from North Ossetia. Undisciplined Russian soldiers were also reported to be committing murders, rapes, and looting in Ingushetia (in an incident partially witnessed by visiting Russian Duma deputies, at least nine Ingush civilians and an ethnic Bashkir soldier were murdered by apparently drunk Russian soldiers; earlier, drunken Russian soldiers killed another Russian soldier, five Ingush villagers and even Ingushetia&#x27;s Health Minister).

Much larger and more deadly acts of hostility took place in the Republic of Dagestan. In particular, the border village of Pervomayskoye was completely destroyed by Russian forces in January 1996 in reaction to the large-scale Chechen hostage taking in Kizlyar in Dagestan (in which more than 2,000 hostages were taken), bringing strong criticism from this hitherto loyal republic and escalating domestic dissatisfaction. The Don Cossacks of Southern Russia, originally sympathetic to the Chechen cause, turned hostile as a result of their Russian-esque culture and language, stronger affinity to Moscow than to Grozny, and a history of conflict with indigenous peoples such as the Chechens. The Kuban Cossacks started organizing themselves against the Chechens, including manning paramilitary roadblocks against infiltration of their territories. 

Meanwhile, the war in Chechnya spawned new forms of resistance to the federal government. Opposition to the conscription of men from minority ethnic groups to fight in Chechnya was widespread among other republics, many of which passed laws and decrees on the subject. For example, the government of Chuvashia passed a decree providing legal protection to soldiers from the republic who refused to participate in the Chechen war and imposed limits on the use of the federal army in ethnic or regional conflicts within Russia. Tatarstan president Mintimer Shaimiev vocally opposed the war and appealed to Yeltsin to stop it and return conscripts, warning the conflict was at risk of expanding across the Caucasus. Some regional and local legislative bodies called for the prohibition on the use of draftees in quelling internal conflicts, while others demanded a total ban on the use of the armed forces in such situations. Russian government officials feared that a move to end the war short of victory would create a cascade of secession attempts by other ethnic minorities.

On 16 January 1996, a Turkish passenger ship carrying 200 Russian passengers was taken over by what were mostly Turkish gunmen who were seeking to publicize the Chechen cause. On 6 March, a Cypriot passenger jet was hijacked by Chechen sympathisers while flying toward Germany. Both of these incidents were resolved through negotiations, and the hijackers surrendered without any fatalities being inflicted. 

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, 3,826 troops were killed, 17,892 troops were wounded, and 1,906 troops are missing in action. According to the &quot;NVO&quot;, the authoritative Russian independent military weekly, at least 5,362 Russian soldiers died during the war, 52,000 Russian soldiers were wounded or became diseased and some 3,000 more Russian soldiers were still missing in 2005. However, the Committee of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia estimated that the total number of Russian military deaths was 14,000, based on information which it collected from wounded troops and soldiers&#x27; relatives (only counting regular troops, i.e. not the &quot;kontraktniki&quot; (contract soldiers, not conscripts) and members of the special service forces). The list which contains the names of the dead soldiers, drawn up by the Human Rights Center &quot;Memorial&quot;, contains 4,393 names. In 2009, the official number of Russian troops who fought in the two wars and were still missing in Chechnya and presumed dead was some 700, while about 400 remains of the missing servicemen were said to have been recovered up to that point. The Russian military was notorious for hiding casualties.
The Chechen formations also suffered fairly high losses. According to the militants, they lost 3,000 fighters. According to official Russian data, Chechen militants lost 17,391 people killed.

According to the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, 
Estimates of the number of civilians killed range widely from 20,000 to 100,000, with the latter figure commonly referenced by Chechen sources. Most scholars and human rights organizations generally estimate the number of civilian casualties to be 40,000; this figure is attributed to the research and scholarship of Chechnya expert John Dunlop, who estimates that the total number of civilian casualties is at least 35,000. This range is also consistent with post-war publications by the Russian statistics office estimating 30,000 to 40,000 civilians killed. The Moscow-based human rights organization, Memorial, which actively documented human rights abuses throughout the war, estimates the number of civilian casualties to be a slightly higher at 50,000.
Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov claimed that fewer than 20,000 civilians were killed. Médecins Sans Frontières estimated a death toll of 50,000 people out of a population of 1,000,000. Sergey Kovalyov&#x27;s team could offer their conservative, documented estimate of more than 50,000 civilian deaths. Alexander Lebed asserted that 80,000 to 100,000 had been killed and 240,000 had been injured. The number given by the ChRI authorities was about 100,000 killed.

According to claims made by Sergey Govorukhin which were published in the Russian newspaper &quot;Gazeta&quot;, approximately 35,000 ethnic Russian civilians were killed by Russian forces which operated in Chechnya, most of them were killed during the bombardment of Grozny.

According to various estimates, the number of Chechens who are dead or missing is between 50,000 and 100,000.

===Prisoners and missing persons===
In the Khasavyurt Accord, both sides agreed to an &quot;all for all&quot; exchange of prisoners to be carried out at the end of the war. However, despite this commitment, many persons remained forcibly detained. A partial analysis of the list of 1,432 reported missing found that, as of 30 October 1996, at least 139 Chechens were still being forcibly detained by the Russian side; it was entirely unclear how many of these men were alive. As of mid-January 1997, the Chechens still held between 700 and 1,000 Russian soldiers and officers as prisoners of war, according to Human Rights Watch. According to Amnesty International that same month, 1,058 Russian soldiers and officers were being detained by Chechen fighters who were willing to release them in exchange for members of Chechen armed groups. American freelance journalist Andrew Shumack has been missing from the Chechen capital, Grozny since July 1995 and is presumed dead.
Major Vyacheslav Izmailov, who had rescued at least 174 people from captivity on both sides in the war, was later involved in the search for missing persons. He was honoured as the human rights hero in the Stalker Human Rights Film Festival after he featured in Anna Artemyeva&#x27;s film &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot at the Bald Man!&quot;, which won the jury prize for Best Documentary at the festival in Moscow. He later worked as military correspondent for &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, was part of the team of journalists investigating the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 He also helped families to find their sons who had gone missing in the Chechen war.

===Moscow peace treaty===

The Khasavyurt Accord paved the way for the signing of two further agreements between Russia and Chechnya. In mid-November 1996, Yeltsin and Maskhadov signed an agreement on economic relations and reparations to Chechens who had been affected by the 1994–96 war. In February 1997, Russia also approved an amnesty for Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters alike who committed illegal acts in connection with the War in Chechnya between December 1994 and September 1996.

Six months after the Khasavyurt Accord, on 12 May 1997, Chechen-elected president Aslan Maskhadov traveled to Moscow where he and Yeltsin signed a formal treaty &quot;on peace and the principles of Russian-Chechen relations&quot; that Maskhadov predicted would demolish &quot;any basis to create ill-feelings between Moscow and Grozny.&quot; Maskhadov&#x27;s optimism, however, proved misplaced. Little more than two years later, some of Maskhadov&#x27;s former comrades-in-arms, led by field commanders Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab, launched an invasion of Dagestan in the summer of 1999 – and soon Russia&#x27;s forces entered Chechnya again, marking the beginning of the Second Chechen War.

== Foreign policy implications ==

From the outset of the First Chechen conflict, Russian authorities struggled to reconcile new international expectations with widespread accusations of Soviet-style heaviness in their execution of the war. For example, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who was generally regarded as a Western-leaning liberal, made the following remark when questioned about Russia&#x27;s conduct during the war; &quot;&#x27;Generally speaking, it is not only our right but our duty not to allow uncontrolled armed formations on our territory. The Foreign Ministry stands on guard over the country&#x27;s territorial unity. International law says that a country not only can but must use force in such instances ... I say it was the right thing to do ... The way in which it was done is not my business.&quot; These attitudes contributed greatly to the growing doubts in the West as to whether Russia was sincere in its stated intentions to implement democratic reforms. The general disdain for Russian behavior in the Western political establishment contrasted heavily with widespread support in the Russian public. Domestic political authorities&#x27; arguments emphasizing stability and the restoration of order resonated with the public and quickly became an issue of state identity.

On 18 October 2022, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament condemned the &quot;genocide of the Chechen people&quot; during the First and Second Chechen War.

<text>Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter (; 24 March 1607 – 29 April 1676) was a Dutch States Navy officer. His achievements with the Dutch navy during the Anglo-Dutch Wars earned him the reputation as one of the most skilled naval commanders in history.

De Ruyter came from a modest background in Zeeland and began seafaring from an early age; by the age of 30 he had become a shipmaster in the Dutch merchant fleet. In 1641, De Ruyter briefly served as a rear admiral during the Portuguese Restoration War, after which he returned to a prosperous merchant career for a decade before retiring to his hometown of Vlissingen. On the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652, De Ruyter accepted a command in the Dutch Navy under lieutenant admiral Maarten Tromp, distinguished himself and was promoted to vice admiral at the end of the war. In 1655, he took part in the Second Northern War on the side of Denmark-Norway against Sweden.

De Ruyter was named lieutenant admiral and commander of the Dutch fleet at the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665, and in 1666 he won a hard-fought victory in the Four Days&#x27; Battle in the southern North Sea. In 1667, De Ruyter executed the highly successful Raid on the Medway, where he destroyed much of the English fleet and captured the English flagship , facilitating a favourable peace for the Dutch. In the Third Anglo-Dutch War, De Ruyter&#x27;s actions during the battles of Solebay (1672), Schooneveld (1673) and Texel (1673) successfully prevented an invasion of the Dutch coast by Anglo-French forces. Continuing his fight against the French, De Ruyter was fatally wounded by a cannonball at the Battle of Augusta off Sicily in 1676, and died a week later in Syracuse. His body was brought back to Amsterdam, where he was accorded a state funeral and interred in the Nieuwe Kerk.

Often dubbed a Dutch folk hero, De Ruyter was highly respected by his sailors and soldiers, and his nickname &quot;Bestevaêr&quot; (early modern Dutch for &quot;grandfather&quot;) is still used to refer to him in Dutch media today. Several Royal Netherlands Navy vessels have been named after him and his flagship, and he is credited as a founder of the Netherlands Marine Corps.

== Early life ==
De Ruyter was born on 24 March 1607 in Vlissingen (Flushing), in the province of Zealand, the son of a seaman who eventually became a member of the guild of beer porters, Adriaen Michielszoon, and Aagje Jansdochter. Many anecdotes were told of De Ruyter&#x27;s early life, but of dubious historical value. For a time he worked at a ropewalk. He was sent to sea as a boatswain&#x27;s apprentice at the age of 11, the usual age for Zeeland boys to begin seafaring.

In 1622, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain, he fought as a cannoneer in the new Dutch army under Maurice of Nassau against the Spanish during the relief of Bergen-op-Zoom. That same year he rejoined the Dutch merchant fleet and steadily worked his way up through the posts of boatswain and chief mate before becoming a merchant ship&#x27;s master at the age of thirty. Although having had little formal education, he spoke tolerable French and fluent English.

Bruijn notes that an anonymous English biographer of de Ruyter claims that he was active in Dublin between 1623 and 1631 as a factor for the Vlissingen-based merchant house of the Lampsins brothers and had become fluent in English when living there. The source claimed that de Ruyter had a slight knowledge of the Irish language and at least one Irish friend who played a leading role in the capture of in 1667.

De Ruyter occasionally travelled as supercargo to the Mediterranean or to the Barbary Coast. In those years, he usually referred to himself as &quot;Machgyel Adriensoon&quot;, his name in the Zeelandic dialect he spoke, as he had not yet adopted the surname &quot;De Ruyter&quot;. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was most probably a nickname given to him: one explanation might be found in the older Dutch verb &quot;ruyten&quot; or &quot;ruiten&quot;, which means &quot;to raid&quot;, something de Ruyter was known to do as a privateer with the Lampsins ship &quot;Den Graeuwen Heynst&quot;. Another suggestion is that the name &quot;Ruyter&quot;, meaning &quot;horseman&quot; commemorates one of his grandfathers, who was a cavalry trooper.

On 16 March in 1631, he married Maayke Velders, a farmer&#x27;s daughter. On 31 December that year, Maayke died after giving birth to a daughter; who also died just three weeks later. In 1633 and 1635, de Ruyter sailed as a navigating officer aboard the ship &quot;Groene Leeuw&quot; (&quot;Green Lion&quot;) on whaling expeditions to Jan Mayen. Until 1637, he did not yet have a command of his own. In the summer of 1636 he remarried, this time to a daughter of a wealthy burgher named Neeltje Engels, who gave him four children – one of whom died shortly after birth. The others were named Adriaen (b. 1637), Neeltje (b. 1639) and Aelken (b. 1642).

In the midst of this, in 1637, de Ruyter became captain of a private ship meant to hunt for the Dunkirkers, raiders operating from Dunkirk who were preying on Dutch merchant shipping. He fulfilled this task until 1640. After this, he sailed for a while as skipper of a merchant vessel named &quot;De Vlissinge&quot;. In 1641, de Ruyter was nominated by the Admiralty of Zeeland to become the captain of the &quot;Haze&quot;, a merchant ship converted man-of-war carrying 26 guns, in a fleet under admiral Gijsels formed to assist the Portuguese in the Portuguese Restoration War against Philip IV of Spain, who was also Philip III of Portugal. The Dutch fleet was to join a Portuguese squadron fighting Spain at sea, and de Ruyter was appointed to be its &quot;Schout-bij-nacht&quot; or third in command. Although this expedition had little success, de Ruyter distinguished himself in combat against a Spanish fleet in the inconclusive action on 4 November 1641, off Cape St. Vincent. However, as a result of the loss of two ships and damage to others in this action, and the withdrawal of the Portuguese squadron after the action, the Dutch fleet returned home without completing its mission.

After the fleet was disbanded, de Ruyter returned to merchant service, which he undertook either as master of a Lampsins ship, or after buying his own ship, the &quot;Salamander&quot;.

Between 1642 and 1651, he made a number of profitable trading sailings to Morocco, Brazil and the West Indies, and by 1651, he had saved enough money to retire. In 1650, de Ruyter&#x27;s second wife, who in 1649 had given him a second son, Engel, unexpectedly died. On 8 January 1652, he married a widow, Anna van Gelder, and bought a house in Flushing for his proposed retirement, which lasted less than a year.

== First Anglo-Dutch War ==

During the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652–1654, De Ruyter agreed to join the expanding Dutch fleet as a junior flag-officer or &quot;commandeur&quot;, a rank broadly comparable to that of commodore, commanding a Zeelandic squadron of &quot;director&#x27;s ships&quot;, which were privately financed warships, after he had initially refused the post on the grounds that others were better qualified for it. De Ruyter proved his worth under the supreme commander lieutenant-admiral Maarten Tromp. The rank of admiral-general was reserved for the stadtholder, but at the time, no-one held that appointment. The main function of De Ruyter&#x27;s squadron was to convoy outbound or returning Dutch merchant ships through the English Channel, where they were vulnerable to attacks from English ships based at Portsmouth or Plymouth.

In August 1652, a convoy of around sixty Dutch merchant ships left the Netherlands for the Mediterranean, initially with an escort of ten warships. The convoy was joined off the coast of the Spanish Netherlands by a further escort commanded by De Ruyter of between twenty and thirty fighting ships. The exact number of Dutch fighting ships involved in the subsequent battle is unclear, but De Ruyter sailed with 21 warships from all five of the Dutch admiralties, two large Dutch East India warships and six fireships. Additional warships may have joined him on route to the convoy and at least one warship was damaged before the subsequent battle and returned to port. On 15 August 1652, the convoy and its escort were sighted by an English fleet commanded by General at Sea George Ayscue with around 45 ships. Three of these were warships more powerful than any in the Dutch fleet, but, as in De Ruyter&#x27;s fleet, many of the others were small armed merchant ships rather than purpose-built warships. On the afternoon of 16 August 1652, Ayscue attempted to attack and capture the Dutch merchant ships with around nine of his strongest and fastest warships, but De Ruyter counter-attacked, leaving the convoy unprotected, and he surrounded those English warships that had attacked. The ensuing mêlée battle continued until nightfall, as the outnumbered English ships could rely on their stronger gun batteries to keep the Dutch at bay. Most of the hired English merchant ships neither attempted to aid their warships nor pursue the Dutch merchant ships. As Ayscue was defeated in his aim of capturing or destroying Dutch merchant ships, and as De Ruyter had fought off an attack by a potentially superior force by a bold attack on its strongest ships, the latter had won this Battle of Plymouth and saved the convoy, making him an instant naval hero to the Dutch population. He also fought, as squadron commander, at the Battle of Kentish Knock and the Battle of the Gabbard during this war.

Tromp&#x27;s death during the Battle of Scheveningen ended the war. De Ruyter declined an emphatic offer from Johan de Witt to assume supreme command because he considered himself &#x27;unfit&#x27; and also feared that it would bring him into conflict with Witte de With and Johan Evertsen, both of whom had more seniority. Later, De Ruyter and de Witt became personal friends. Colonel Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam then became the new Dutch supreme commander of the confederate fleet. De Ruyter at first refused to become Obdam&#x27;s naval &#x27;counsellor and assistant&#x27;, but later was persuaded by de Witt to accept and remained in the service of the Dutch navy in that post until he accepted an offer from the Admiralty of Amsterdam to become their vice-admiral on 2 March 1654. He relocated with his family to that city in 1655.

== Northern Wars ==

In July 1655, De Ruyter took command of a squadron of eight ships, of which the &quot;Tijdverdrijf&quot; (&quot;Pastime&quot;) was his flagship, and set out for the Mediterranean with 55 merchantmen in convoy. His orders were to protect Dutch trade interests in that region and to ransom enslaved Christians in Algiers. Meeting an English fleet under Robert Blake along the way, he managed to avoid an incident. Operating off the Barbary Coast, he captured several infamous corsairs and, after negotiating a peace agreement with Salé, De Ruyter returned home in May 1656.

The same month, the States General, becoming ever more concerned by the expansionary plans of the Swedish king, Charles X, decided to intervene in the Second Northern War by sending a fleet to the Baltic Sea. The Swedes had controlled this area since Charles had invaded Poland and claimed the Polish throne. De Ruyter once again embarked aboard the &quot;Tijdverdrijf&quot;, arriving at the Øresund, where he waited for Obdam to arrive on 8 June. After Obdam had assumed command, De Ruyter and the Dutch fleet sailed to relieve the besieged city of Danzig on 27 July, which they did without any bloodshed. Peace was signed a month later. Before leaving the Baltic, De Ruyter and other flag officers were granted an audience by Frederick III of Denmark. De Ruyter took a liking to the Danish king, who later became a friend.

In 1658, the States General, on the advice of a leading member, Cornelis de Graeff, one of the mayors of Amsterdam, decided to once again send a fleet to the Baltic Sea to protect the important Baltic trade and to aid the Danes against Swedish aggression, which had continued despite a peace settlement. In accordance with the States&#x27; balance-of-power political approach, a fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam was sent without De Ruyter, who at the time was blockading Lisbon. On 8 November, a bloody melee took place, the Battle of the Sound, which resulted in a Dutch victory, relieving Copenhagen. Still the Swedes were far from defeated and the States decided to continue their support for the Danes. De Ruyter took command of a new expeditionary fleet and managed to liberate Nyborg in 1659. For this, he was knighted by King Frederick III of Denmark. From 1661 to 1663, De Ruyter did convoy duty in the Mediterranean.

== Second Anglo-Dutch War ==

In 1664, a year before the Second Anglo-Dutch War began, Robert Holmes had captured several Dutch West India Company trading posts and ships on the West African coast, seeking to forcibly expel Dutch influence from the region. Although Johan de Witt wanted to avoid an all-out war with England, he considered that this provocation must be responded to, and proposed to the States General that De Ruyter&#x27;s squadron in the Mediterranean should be sent to West Africa to retake the West India Company&#x27;s forts there. De Ruyter received his instructions at Málaga on 1 September 1664 and, by early the next month, all the Dutch West African posts had been recaptured and the squadron was ready to cross the Atlantic to attack English shipping in the West Indies and at the Newfoundland fisheries in reprisal.

De Ruyter&#x27;s activities in the American waters had less satisfactory results than those off West Africa. Arriving off Barbados in the Caribbean at the end of April 1665 aboard his flagship &quot;Spiegel&quot; (directly translating to mirror but in Dutch use may also refer to the transom or more simply the rear of a ship), he led his fleet of thirteen vessels into Carlisle Bay, exchanging fire with the English batteries and destroying many of the vessels anchored there. Unable to silence the English guns and having sustained significant casualties and considerable damage to his vessels, he retired to French Martinique for repairs.

Sailing north from Martinique, De Ruyter captured several English vessels and delivered supplies to the Dutch colony at Sint Eustatius. In view of the damage that his ships had sustained at Barbados, he decided against an assault on New York, formerly New Amsterdam which would have been necessary, had the Dutch wished to retake their former New Netherland colony. De Ruyter then proceeded to Newfoundland, capturing some English merchant ships and temporarily taking the town of St. John&#x27;s before returning to Europe, travelling around the north of Scotland as a precaution.

In December 1664, the English fleet attacked the Dutch Smyrna fleet. Although the attack failed, the Dutch in January 1665 allowed their ships to open fire on English warships when threatened. War was declared by the Dutch on 4 March 1665, following two further English attacks on Dutch convoys, one off Cadiz and another in the English Channel. The Dutch fleet was confident of victory but it contained a significant proportion of older or weak ships. In the first year of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, at the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, the Dutch suffered the worst defeat in the history the Dutch Republic&#x27;s navy. At least sixteen ships were lost, and one-third of its personnel captured or killed; Van Wassenaer was among the dead.

On his return to the republic, De Ruyter learned Van Wassenaer had been killed at Lowestoft. Cornelis Tromp had been put in temporary command of the confederate fleet after the battle, but was not acceptable to the regime of Johan de Witt because of his support for the Orangist cause. De Ruyter was politically neutral, but on friendly terms with Johan de Witt and his associates. His successes in distant waters, which ensured he was not involved in the battle of Lowestoft and tainted by that defeat, made him the obvious candidate to succeed Van Wassenaer as commander of the Dutch fleet, which he did on 11 August 1665. He was therefore made lieutenant-admiral (a rank he would in 1666 share with five others in the Dutch admiralties) of Rotterdam, a position traditionally reserved for the &quot;Bevelhebber van &#x27;s-Landts Vloot&quot;, the supreme operational commander.

In the second year of the war, 1666, De Ruyter won the hard-fought Four Days&#x27; Battle of 1 to 4 June 1666. The division of the English fleet gave the Dutch the advantage of numbers on the first and second days of fighting. An English attack on the anchored Dutch fleet on the first day was resisted and, after two days fighting, the English fleet retreated towards the Thames. However, the English fleet was reinforced by a squadron of undamaged ships on the third evening and fought strongly on the fourth day, so that Tromp seemed near to defeat in the afternoon, until De Ruyter decided the battle with a surprise all-out attack that demoralised his opponents into retreat.

However, the English fleet was not destroyed and, on 4 and 5 August, the Dutch suffered heavy manpower losses and narrowly escaped disaster in the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle. After the battle, De Ruyter accused Cornelis Tromp of ignoring the main English attack on the Dutch fleet, preferring to chase the English rear squadron as far as the coast, which eventually led to Tromp&#x27;s dismissal. De Ruyter then became seriously ill, recovering just in time to take nominal command of the fleet executing the Raid on the Medway in 1667, the third year of the war. The Medway raid was part of a broader plan by Johan de Witt to land Dutch troops in Kent or Essex, and De Ruyter neither agreed with de Witt&#x27;s fixation with the Thames estuary as the critical theatre of the naval war nor with this raid. The Medway raid was a costly and embarrassing defeat for the English, resulting in the loss of the English flagship and effectively ended the war in favour of the Dutch.

A planned Dutch attack on the English anchorage at Harwich led by De Ruyter had to be abandoned after the battle of Landguard Fort, at the close of the war. The Peace of Breda brought the war to an end.

Between 1667 and 1671, De Ruyter was forbidden by De Witt to sail, so as not to endanger his life. In 1669, a failed attempt on his life was made by a Tromp supporter, who tried to stab him with a bread knife in the entrance hall of his house.

== Third Anglo-Dutch War ==

The Treaty of Breda which ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War in July 1667 failed to remove the root causes of the long-standing Anglo-Dutch rivalry, which included colonial quarrels, including the exclusion of the English traders from Dutch colonies and the English occupation of the former Dutch New Netherland colony, and English enforcement of the Navigation Act. Although tensions between the two nations lessened between 1668 and 1670, the desire of Louis XIV to acquire all or a substantial part of the Spanish Netherlands and neutralise the Dutch Republic, led to his subsidising Charles II and to an unprovoked and unsuccessful English attack on the Dutch Smyrna fleet in March 1672. An English declaration of war against the Netherlands in the same month began the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and this was followed by a French declaration of war against the Dutch in May 1672.

Shortly thereafter, a combined Anglo-French fleet was formed, commanded by James, Duke of York the Lord High Admiral of England with 62 major warships and Jean, Comte d&#x27;Estrées with 30 major warships forming the van squadron.

The Dutch were surprised by these events but eventually managed to prepare a strong fleet of 75 ships under De Ruyter. However, because delays in his fleet mustering, he was unable to realise his plan of preventing the junction of the English and French fleets to create a force superior to his, so he used three different strategies to meet changing situations in the following two years. Firstly, he aimed to inflict sufficient damage on the English ships to require their lengthy repairs in the congested English dockyards, as in his attack at Solebay. Allied to this, when De Ruyter detected the French fleet&#x27;s reluctance to become involved in close-quarters fighting, he detached small squadrons in each major sea battle to keep the French out of the main action, concentrating his attack on the English fleet with only slightly inferior numbers. Thirdly, he used the shelter of the shoals, which the larger of the allied ships had to avoid, as a safe haven, keeping the Dutch fleet intact until he could attack the allied fleet at a time and under conditions of his own choosing. In this way, he prevented the English and French fleets from creating the conditions needed to land an invasion force.

After initially withdrawing into shoal waters near the Netherlands coast until the combined Anglo-French fleet retired to replenish its water, De Ruyter attacked its 92 ships on 7 June 1672 at the Battle of Solebay. The Dutch fleet concentrated on the English rear squadron, while the French van of 30 ships steered away from the main action, engaging only in long-range fire with the 10 major and five small Dutch ships of Adriaen Banckert&#x27;s squadron from the Admiralty of Zeeland. Although the battle was tactically indecisive, it disrupted Anglo-French plans to blockade Dutch ports and land soldiers on the Dutch coast, and also created dissention between the allies, so was a strategic victory for De Ruyter. D&#x27;Estrées was condemned, both by the English fleet and some of his own officers for steering away from the Dutch and failing to engage them closely.

The war on land went badly for the Dutch in 1672, which they called the Rampjaar or &quot;disaster year&quot;, and this led to the resignation and then murder of Johan de Witt in August 1672 and the replacement of republicans by Orangists. De Ruyter was saddened by the killings of his friends, De Witt and his brother, but agreed to continue serving as commander of the fleet. He made an attempt to blockade the English fleet in the Thames with 30 ships in May 1673 but it had already put to sea, so he decided to rendezvous with the rest of the Dutch fleet in the coastal waters of the Schooneveld, where by late May he had assembled a fleet of 50 large ships together with frigates and fireships, 64 in total. These restricted waters neutralised the numerical advantages of the allied fleet, which had 81 ships of the line and several frigates, in the two Battles of the Schooneveld of 1673, he manoeuvered skillfully to damage the allied fleets sufficiently to force them to end their blockade of Dutch ports. Finally, at the Battle of Texel in August that year, De Ruyter&#x27;s smaller fleet prevented the larger allied fleet landing troops on the Dutch coast and forced it to retreat. After the Battle of Texel, d&#x27;Estrées was accused by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, commanding the English fleet, of betraying it by fighting at long range against no more than ten Dutch ships. D&#x27;Estrées admitted later that Louis XIV had ordered him to protect the French fleet, in case England should make peace with the Dutch.

The new rank of lieutenant-admiral general was created especially for De Ruyter in February 1673, when the new stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland, William III of Orange, became admiral-general. Although successive Princes of Orange, when stadtholder, generally commanded the Dutch army in person as its captain-general, they never took command of the Dutch fleet as admiral-general.

By the end of 1673, English popular opposition to the war and to the French alliance, the changes in government policy and the likelihood that parliament would not continue to provide war funding inclined Charles II towards peace with Holland and ending his alliance with France. After relatively brief negotiations, the Treaty of Westminster ending the war was ratified in March 1674.

== War against France==
The English withdrawal did not end naval engagements in the Franco-Dutch War. As Louis XIV did not wish to send his main fleet against the more powerful Dutch, De Ruyter was first instructed to use his fleet in support in a &#x27;descent&#x27; on the French Channel and Biscay coasts, in which the appearance of the fleet would create a threat of landings or an invasion, aiming to divert French forces from the Spanish Netherlands and the Rhine.

In a further attempt to relieve pressure on the Netherlands, he was next ordered to take the fight against the French to the Caribbean. He arrived off Fort Royal, Martinique aboard his flagship on 19 July 1674, leading a substantial force of eighteen warships, nine storeships, and fifteen troop transports bearing 3,400 soldiers. However, although his destination was supposed to be secret, news had leaked out and had been sent to the French governor, which allowed the greatly outnumbered French defenders time to prepare a strong defensive position. When the Dutch troops went ashore the next day to attempt an assault on Fort Royal, they suffered significant casualties in their attempt to reach the French fortifications, including the loss of most of their senior officers, and they returned to the fleet with 143 killed and 318 wounded, compared to only 15 French defenders lost. With the element of surprise lost, and with disease spreading aboard his ships, de Ruyter decided against further attacks and returned to Europe.

In July 1674, the Messina revolt broke against Spanish rule and the people of Messina asked for French protection. A small French squadron was sent there in September 1674, but it withdrew before the year end in the face of a more numerous Spanish force. A stronger French force and supply convoy managed to break through the Spanish blockade and defeat the more numerous Spanish fleet in a battle off the Lipari Islands on 11 February 1675, ending the Spanish blockade of Messina, so the Spanish then asked for Dutch assistance. De Ruyter was sent to the Mediterranean later in 1675 with eighteen larger warships and a number of smaller vessels, although these vessels were not fully manned. De Ruyter thought the force that had been provided was insufficient for the task, and the shortage of money to repair damaged ships or build new ones or to recruit and pay sufficient sailors as the war continued was now a major problem for the Dutch fleet.

After a delay of two months on the Spanish coast waiting for the supplies and a supporting squadron promised by the Spanish authorities, De Ruyter sailed for Sicily at the year end with only one Spanish ship added to his fleet of 18 Dutch warships. When he arrived in Sicily in early January 1676, most of the larger French warships were absent from Messina with Duquesne, who was escorting a reprovisioning convoy to Sicily, and only some smaller French ships remained at Messina. However, de Ruyter was unable to attack the city because of contrary winds and, on 7 January 1676, while cruising near the Lipari Islands and accompanied by several Spanish galleys, he encountered the French fleet led by Duquesne the convoy. Although both fleets had similar numbers of ships, the French fleet was more powerful, with 1,500 guns against 1,200 for the Dutch and no fighting took place on 7 January, when De Ruyter held the weather gauge. However, the wind strengthened overnight, forcing the Spanish galleys to seek shelter, and veered to a west-southwesterly direction that favoured the French. Duquesne therefore sent the convoy ahead and prepared to attack the Dutch.
During the Battle of Stromboli on 8 January 1676, Duquesne&#x27;s ships steered obliquely towards the Dutch fleet, which exposed them to Dutch broadside fire: De Ruyter&#x27;s van and centre maintained their distance by gradually giving way, keeping their French opponents under heavy gunfire and causing significant damage and casualties. The French van squadron was disordered, and two of its ships had to pull out of line of battle, until Duquesne managed to restore order. He then tried several times to break the Dutch line, although De Ruyter&#x27;s close linear formation and the weight of Dutch broadsides prevented this. After several hours fighting, the wind had become very light and the French ceased their attacks. De Ruyter disengaged and took his fleet into Milazzo with three badly damaged ships towed there by Spanish galleys. He had successfully defended his inferior fleet in a tactically disadvantageous leeward position and inflicted significant damage on the French fleet.
During the night, the wind strengthened again, and Duquesne was joined by eight ships from Messina, but the next day the Spanish squadron was sighted and Duquesne did not wish to fight an action against superior numbers in the Straits of Messina, so he took his convoy right around Sicily, bringing it into Messina without further fighting. The combined Dutch-Spanish fleet sailed to Palermo for repairs, and there were no further fleet actions for several months.

After the Battle of Stromboli, De Ruyter was joined by a Spanish squadron and relinquished command of the combined fleet to the Spanish admiral, Don Francisco de la Cerda. In order to attack Messina, the allies had to defeat the French fleet, and they decided to attack Augusta to force the French warships to leave Messina harbour. The attack on Augusta had the desired effect, and on 22 April 1676, the two fleets met north of Augusta. De Ruyter commanded the van squadron, the Spanish ships formed the centre, with another Dutch squadrons in the van rear. There were 29 French ships of the line and 13 Dutch warships, not all fit to fight in line. Jenkins mentions between ten and fourteen Spanish warships, besides frigates and fireships, supporting the Dutch, and the French fleet was superior in firepower as well as numbers.

The battle largely consisted of a fierce fight between the two vans, as the Spanish centre remained at long range from its French counterpart, with some ships in the rear squadrons also engaging each other. The inactivity of the Spanish centre enabled the leading ships of Duquesne&#x27;s centre to attack on de Ruyter&#x27;s outnumbered van squadron although the Dutch withstood these attacks, and de Ruyter attacked Duquesne&#x27;s ship with the intention of boarding it, but was prevented when two French ships went to their admiral&#x27;s assistance. At the end of the battle, De Ruyter was able to extract his squadron by his own seamanship and the assistance of the Dutch rear squadron.
===Death===
During the course of the Dutch van squadron&#x27;s disengagement from fighting, De Ruyter was fatally wounded when a cannonball struck him in the leg, and he died a week later at Syracuse. It is recorded that his French opponents honoured him by firing salutes as the ship carrying his embalmed body to the Netherlands passed the French fleet. On 18 March 1677, de Ruyter was given an elaborate state funeral. On that occasion, the Amsterdam professor Petrus Francius recited a Latin farewell poem of nearly a thousand hexameters. His body was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The praal tomb completed in 1681, designed and created by the Flemish sculptor Rombout Verhulst, is on display in the Nieuwe Kerk. He was succeeded as supreme commander by Cornelis Tromp in 1679.

== Legacy ==

De Ruyter was highly respected by his sailors and soldiers, who used the term of endearment &quot;bestevaêr&quot; (&quot;grandfather&quot;) for him, both because of his disregard for hierarchy, as he was himself of humble origin, and his refusal to turn away from risky and bold undertakings, despite his usually cautious nature.
He is honoured by a statue in his birthplace, Vlissingen, which stands looking over the sea. Multiple towns in the Netherlands have a street named after him. Respect also extended far beyond the borders of the republic. The town of Debrecen erected a statue of him for his role in persuading the Spanish viceroy of Naples to free 26 Protestant Hungarian ministers from slavery in the Spanish galleys during his service in Sicily.

Six Royal Netherlands Navy ships have been named ; seven are named after his flagship, . De Ruyter was involved in the founding of the Netherlands Marine Corps, established on 10 December 1665. The intended new base for the marine corps, which was to be built in his birthplace of Vlissingen, completed by 2020 and to be named &quot;Michiel de Ruyter Kazerne&quot; was cancelled over financial concerns and fears that many marines would leave the service rather than transfer to Zeeland.

In 1954, the Netherlands issued two postage stamps to honour Admiral de Ruyter. An eponymous biopic about his life was released in 2015 starring Frank Lammers in the title role.

The town of DeRuyter, New York, United States, and a village of the same name within the town are both named after him.

<text>The Calgary Stampede is an annual rodeo, exhibition, and festival held every July in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The ten-day event, which bills itself as &quot;The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth&quot;, attracts over one million visitors per year and features one of the world&#x27;s largest rodeos, a parade, midway, stage shows, concerts, agricultural competitions, chuckwagon racing, and First Nations exhibitions. In 2008, the Calgary Stampede was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame.

The event&#x27;s roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair. In 1912, American promoter Guy Weadick organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick&#x27;s festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.

Organized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world&#x27;s richest rodeos, one of Canada&#x27;s largest festivals, and a significant tourist attraction for the city. Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada. However, both have been the target of increasing international criticism by animal welfare groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as animal rights organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.

Calgary&#x27;s national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the &quot;Stampede City&quot;, carries the informal nickname of &quot;Cowtown&quot;, and the local Canadian Football League team is called the Stampeders. The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don western wear, and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and barbecues.

==History==

The Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west. The society held its first fair two years later, attracting a quarter of the town&#x27;s 2,000 residents. By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the Elbow River to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather, and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895. The land passed briefly to future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett who sold it to the city. The area was called Victoria Park, after Queen Victoria, and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.

The exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded Dominion Exhibition that year. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent C$145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack. It held a lavish parade as well as rodeo, horse racing, and trick roping competitions as part of the event. The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.

Guy Weadick, an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the &quot;wild west&quot; than the shows he was a part of. He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans, but with the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen, Weadick convinced businessmen Pat Burns, George Lane, A. J. McLean, and A. E. Cross to put up $100,000 to guarantee funding for the event. The Big Four, as they came to be known, viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen. The city built a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over 100,000 people attended the six-day event in September 1912 to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada, the United States, and Mexico compete for $20,000 in prizes. The event generated $120,000 in revenue and was hailed as a success.

Weadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede, promoting the event across North America. However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event. Businessmen in Winnipeg convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially. A third attempt held in New York State in 1916 suffered the same fate. Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of E. L. Richardson, the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. The two convinced numerous Calgarians, including the Big Four, to back the &quot;Great Victory Stampede&quot; in celebration of Canada&#x27;s soldiers returning from World War I.

===Calgary Exhibition and Stampede===
While the 1919 Stampede was successful, it was again held as a one-time event. Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson&#x27;s proposals at their 1922 annual meeting. Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis. Weadick agreed, and the union created the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.
The combined event was first held in 1923. Weadick encouraged the city&#x27;s residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the &quot;wild west&quot;. Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor George Webster followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties. The new sport of chuckwagon racing was introduced and proved immediately popular. 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit. Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.

Attendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the Great Depression resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick. Furthering the divide was Weadick&#x27;s growing resentment of the board&#x27;s control of what he considered his event. The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation, ending with Weadick&#x27;s threat to quit entirely. One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties. Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal. His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees. Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.

At least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950. The most profitable, the 1925 silent film &quot;The Calgary Stampede&quot;, used footage from the rodeo and exposed people across North America to the event. Hollywood stars and foreign dignitaries were attracted to the Stampede; Bob Hope and Bing Crosby each served as parade marshals during the 1950s, while Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip made their first of two visits to the event as part of their 1959 tour of Canada. The Queen also opened the 1973 Stampede.

===Expansion===
The discovery of the Leduc No. 1 oil well in 1946 and major reserves in the Turner Valley area southwest of the city ushered in a period of growth and prosperity. Calgary was transformed from an agricultural community into the oil and gas capital of Canada. The city&#x27;s population nearly doubled between 1949 and 1956, and Calgary&#x27;s immigrant population not only embraced the Stampede, but encouraged friends and family in their home towns to do the same. The 1950s represented the golden age of the Calgary Stampede.

Attendance records were broken nearly every year in the 1950s and overall attendance increased by 200,000 from 1949 to 1959. The growth necessitated expansion of the exhibition grounds. The 7,500-seat Stampede Corral was completed in 1950 as the largest indoor arena in Western Canada. It housed the Calgary Stampeders hockey team, which was operated by the Board of Governors and won the Western Hockey League championship in 1954. Acts such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and Louis Armstrong played the Corral, although the arena&#x27;s poor acoustics were a frequent concern to organizers and patrons.

Improvements were made to the grandstand and the race track was rebuilt in 1954. The Big Four Building, named in honour of the Stampede&#x27;s benefactors, opened in 1959 to serve as the city&#x27;s largest exhibition hall in the summer, and was converted into a 24-sheet curling facility each winter. The improvements failed to alleviate all the pressures growth had caused: chronic parking shortages and inability to accommodate demand for tickets to the rodeo and grandstand shows continued.

Attendance continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s, topping 500,000 for the first time in 1962 and reaching 654,000 in 1966. Organizers expanded the event from six days to nine in 1967 and then to ten the following year. The Stampede exceeded one million visitors for the first time in 1976. The park, meanwhile, continued to grow. The Round-Up Centre opened in 1979 as the new exhibition hall, and the Olympic Saddledome was completed in 1983. The Saddledome replaced the Corral as the city&#x27;s top sporting arena, and both facilities hosted hockey and figure skating events at the 1988 Winter Olympics.

Maintaining the traditional focus on agriculture and western heritage remained a priority for the Calgary Stampede as the city grew into a major financial and oil hub in Western Canada. &quot;Aggie Days&quot;, a program designed to introduce urban schoolchildren to agriculture was introduced in 1989 and proved immediately popular. A ten-year expansion plan called Horizon 2000 was released in 1990 detailing plans to grow Stampede Park into a year-round destination for Calgarians; an updated plan was released in 2004. The Calgary Exhibition and Stampede organization dropped the word &quot;exhibition&quot; from its title in 2007, and has since been known simply as the Calgary Stampede. Attendance has plateaued around 1.2 million since 2000, however the Stampede set an attendance record of 1,409,371 while celebrating its centennial anniversary in 2012.

=== Flooding ===
Severe flooding in Calgary two weeks before the July 5 opening of the 2013 Stampede caused significant damage to the grounds. Stampede officials promised, however, that the event would be staged as planned. Some of the main events, and all concerts, scheduled for the Saddledome were cancelled due to flood damage to the facility, while other events were relocated to other locations.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
, the 2020 Stampede was cancelled for the first time in almost a century due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Community-oriented events held in compliance with Alberta public health orders were organized on the original dates of the Stampede, including pop-up drive-throughs offering pancakes and midway food staples, and maintaining the event&#x27;s fireworks show. The cancellation made a significant economic impact, as recent editions had contributed $540 million to the province&#x27;s economy.

In April 2021, Alberta&#x27;s chief medical officer of health Deena Hinshaw projected that the province could lift some of its restrictions on gatherings by late-June, while Premier Jason Kenney stated that the province could begin doing so once at least two thirds of its residents have been vaccinated. However, soon afterwards, the province began to enact stricter public health orders to control a major ongoing wave of infections. On May 14, the Stampede announced that it did plan to hold an in-person event for 2021, but that the structure of the event would have to be &quot;very different&quot; to comply with whatever public health orders will be in effect by then. On May 26, the Alberta government announced a revised &quot;Open for Summer&quot; plan for easing public health orders, which would allow the majority of restrictions to be lifted two weeks after 70% of eligible residents receive at least one vaccine dose (provided that hospitalizations continue to decline). It was later announced that restrictions would be fully lifted on July 1.

Despite the lifting of public health restrictions, measures such as social distancing would still be encouraged, and the capacity of Stampede Park would therefore be controlled. There would be pre-purchased entry to the grounds and reduced capacity for events. Citing that participants would not have enough time to prepare for the Stampede on short notice due to other chuckwagon racing events leading up to it being cancelled, the Rangeland Derby was cancelled for the second year in a row. Admission to Nashville North (which would be an open-air stage rather than a tent) required proof of vaccination or a negative rapid test. As the Mayor of Calgary did not issue a permit for it to occur on public streets, the Stampede parade was downsized and held as a broadcast-only event within Stampede Park, with no public spectators admitted. To compensate for the cancellation of the Rangeland Derby, bronc riding events were added to the rodeo&#x27;s evening sessions.

The decision to go on with the Stampede was met with mixed reactions, including concerns that it could become a superspreading event because Alberta&#x27;s reopening criteria were based only on the first vaccine dose and not being fully vaccinated. There was also criticism from the chuckwagon racing community over the cancellation of the Rangeland Derby. On July 27, Alberta Health Services stated that it had only officially attributed 71 cases of COVID-19 to the Stampede, out of a total attendance of 528,998.

==Events==

===Parade===

The parade serves as the official opening of the Stampede and begins shortly before 9 a.m. on the first Friday of the event. Each year features a different parade marshal, chosen to reflect the public&#x27;s interests at that time. Politicians, athletes, actors and other dignitaries have all served as marshals. The event features dozens of marching bands, over 150 floats and hundreds of horses with entrants from around the world, and combines western themes with modern ones. Cowboys, First Nations dancers and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their red serges are joined by clowns, bands, politicians and business leaders. The first Stampede parade, held in 1912, was attended by 75,000 people, greater than the city&#x27;s population at the time. As many as 350,000 people attended the parade in 2009, while the presence of Prince William and Catherine, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, at the 2011 parade as part of their tour of Canada increased attendance to a record estimate of 425,000.

The parade was downsized and closed to the public in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Rodeo===

The rodeo is the heart of the Calgary Stampede. It is one of the largest, and the most famous event of its kind in the world. With a prize of $100,000 to the winner of each major discipline and $1,000,000 total on championship day alone, it also offers the richest payout. Cowboys consider performing in front of over 20,000 fans daily to be the highlight of the rodeo season.

There are six major disciplines – bull riding, barrel racing, steer wrestling, tie down roping, saddle bronc and bareback riding – and four novice events – junior steer riding, novice bareback, novice saddle bronc and wild pony racing. Each event is organized as its own tournament, and the cowboys and girls are divided into two pools. The first pool competes each night for the first four nights, and the second each night for four nights following. The top four in each pool advance to the Sunday final, and the remainder compete on Saturday for a wild card spot in the final. The competitor with the best time or score on Sunday wins the $100,000 grand prize.

Most livestock for the rodeo events come from the Stampede Ranch located near the town of Hanna. The ranch was created in 1961 as a means of improving the quality of bucking horses and bulls and to guarantee supply. The first of its kind in North America, the Stampede Ranch operates a breeding program that produces some of the top rodeo stock in the world and supplies rodeos throughout southern Alberta, and as far south as Las Vegas.

===Rangeland Derby===

Weadick is credited with inventing the sport of chuckwagon racing in 1923, inspired either by seeing a similar event in 1922 at the Gleichen Stampede or watching impromptu races as he grew up. He devised the sport to be a new and exciting event for the newly joined Exhibition and Stampede. Weadick invited ranchers to enter their wagons and crews to compete for a total of $275 in prize money.

Officially called the Rangeland Derby, and nicknamed the &quot;half-mile of hell&quot; or the &quot;dash for cash&quot;, chuckwagon racing proved immediately popular and quickly became the event&#x27;s largest attraction. While only six teams raced in 1923, today&#x27;s Rangeland Derby consists of 36 teams competing for $1.15 million in prize money. Joe Carbury was the voice of the Rangeland Derby for 45 years, until 2008. His distinctive voice and signature phrase of &quot;and they&#x27;re offfffffff!&quot; to announce the start of a race made him a local legend, and earned him induction into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.

The chuckwagon drivers auction advertising space on their wagons before each year&#x27;s Stampede. The first advertisement on the tarp cover of a chuckwagon was made in 1941, and Lloyd Nelson was the last person to win the Rangeland Derby without a sponsored wagon, doing so in 1956. The current practice of selling advertising via a tarp auction began in 1979. The revenue generated by the auctions, a record $4 million for the 2012 Stampede, is considered an indicator of the strength of Calgary&#x27;s economy.

The Rangeland Derby was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Exhibition===

When the agricultural exhibition was first launched in 1886, Alberta was an overwhelmingly rural province. Today, agricultural producers make up less than two percent of the province&#x27;s population, but the exhibition remains an integral part of the Calgary Stampede. Nearly 70% of all Stampede visitors visit the Agriculture Zone for the displays and demonstrations as well as western events. Numerous competitions are held as part of the exhibition. The American National Cutting Horse Association sanctions a World Series of Cutting event, and the World Championship Blacksmith Competition used to be held, attracting top blacksmiths from around the world. Farm and ranch demonstrations feature numerous breeds of livestock along with stock dog trials and team penning competitions.

Additionally, the exhibition serves to educate the public about Alberta&#x27;s ranching and agricultural heritage along with modern food production displays through events like Ag-tivity in the city. The Stampede works with Alberta 4-H clubs to encourage youth participation in agricultural pursuits.

===Midway===
The Calgary Stampede midway has been operated by North American Midway Entertainment, and its predecessor Conklin Shows, since 1976. The midway is the only part of the event operated on a for-profit basis. It is considered an essential component of the Stampede, but is separate from the predominantly western theme. The midway opens on the Thursday night before other events begin, known as &quot;sneak-a-peek&quot; night. In addition to the traditional rides and carnival games, the midway features four concert areas. Nashville North, a large party tent, made its debut in 1993 as a country music venue. It was followed one-year later by what is now known as the Coca-Cola Stage that offers music acts across a variety of genres. The Saddledome hosts headlining acts, including Garth Brooks and The Beach Boys, who were booked for the Stampede&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2012. In 2018, the Stampede&#x27;s newest concert venue, The Big Four Roadhouse, opened for Stampede-time and year-round events.

===Market===
The Stampede Market is located in the BMO Centre on the northwest corner of the park. It offers of retail space and in 2019 began highlighting local artisans. The Western Oasis, a subsection of the market, offers cowboy and western-themed artwork, bronze statues, craftwork, foods and wine. Lured by the opportunity to show their wares to the one million people who attend the Stampede, some vendors wait years before gaining admittance, and those that do consider it one of the prime events of the year.

==Stampede Park==

Stampede Park is located southeast of Downtown Calgary in the Beltline District and is serviced by Calgary Transit&#x27;s light rail system. Permanent structures at the site include the Saddledome, Big Four Building, BMO Centre – a convention and exhibition facility – Cowboys Casino, the Stampede Grandstand, the agriculture building, and a number of facilities that support the exhibition and livestock shows.

The park remains at its original location, though attempts were made to relocate. In 1964, the Stampede Board made plans to purchase former military land (Currie Barracks) in southwest Calgary near Glenmore Trail and 24 Street and relocate the park there. A fully developed plan was released in 1965, and while it had the support of the civic and federal governments, intense opposition from nearby residents quashed the proposal. Space concerns remained a constant issue, and a new plan to push northward into the Victoria Park community beginning in 1968 initiated a series of conflicts with the neighbourhood and city council that persisted for decades.

While Victoria Park fell into steady decline, it was not until 2007 that the final buildings were removed, paving the way for both an expansion of Stampede Park and an urban renewal program for the area. With the land finally secured, the Stampede organization embarked on a $400-million expansion that is planned to feature a new retail and entertainment district, an urban park, a new agricultural arena and potentially a new hotel. The expansion was originally planned to be complete by 2011, but delays and an economic downturn have pushed the expected completion of the project back to 2014.

Stampede Park has long been a central gathering place for Calgarians and tourists. In addition to attendance at the Calgary Stampede, over 2.5 million people attend other sporting events, concerts, trade shows and meetings on a grounds that hosts over 1,000 events annually.

==People==

Each year, a queen and two princesses are selected as Stampede royalty. They are chosen via a contest open to any woman between the ages of 19 and 24 who resides in Alberta. An emphasis is placed on horsemanship skills and ability to serve as ambassadors for both the Stampede and the city. The first Stampede Queen, Patsy Rodgers, was selected in 1946 while the princesses were first chosen the following year. The royal trio serve one-year terms during which they will make hundreds of appearances throughout southern Alberta and across North America. They then become members of the Calgary Stampede Queens&#x27; Alumni Association, founded in 1971. The association organizes fundraisers and events in support of organizations that work with special needs children.

===First Nations participation===
During each Stampede, the five nations of the Treaty 7–the Tsuu T&#x27;ina, Piikani, Stoney, Kainai and Siksika–create a camp on the bank of the Elbow River in the southern section of Stampede Park, originally known as the Indian Village, but renamed Elbow River Camp in 2018. They erect tipis, organize pow wows, offer arts and crafts, and re-enact elements of their traditional lifestyle. Each year, an Indian Princess is selected from one of the five nations to represent the Treaty 7 as part of the Stampede&#x27;s royalty. The village is among the Stampede&#x27;s most popular attractions.

First Nations people had been frequent participants in the city&#x27;s exhibitions since they were first held in 1886, taking part in parades and sporting events and entertaining spectators with traditional dances. By 1912 however, pressure from agents of the Department of Indian Affairs to suppress their historic traditions and to keep them on their farms nearly ended native participation. Weadick hoped to include native people as a feature of his Stampede, but Indian Affairs opposed his efforts and asked the Duke of Connaught, Canada&#x27;s Governor General, to support their position. The Duke refused, and after Weadick gained the support of political contacts in Ottawa, including future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, the path was cleared.
Hundreds of Indigenous peoples, representing six tribes, participated at the 1912 Stampede. They camped in tipis and wore their finest traditional regalia, making them among the most popular participants in the parade. Tom Three Persons, of the Blood (Kainai) tribe, emerged as one of the Stampede&#x27;s first heroes, amazing spectators with a winning performance in the saddle bronc competition. He was the only Canadian champion of the first Stampede and became the first person to successfully ride Cyclone, a notorious horse that had thrown over 100 riders during its career.

The federal government of Prime Minister Borden attempted to prevent a repeat occurrence, modifying the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 1914 to make it illegal for Indigenous peoples to participate in fairs or parades without permission from the local Indian Agent. The new law ended native participation in the Calgary Exhibition, but when Weadick returned in 1919, he successfully fought for their return to the fairgrounds. The Indian Affairs Department under the government of Prime Minister Mackenzie King attempted again to ban native participation in 1925 without success. While conflicts between the Stampede and Indian Affairs continued until 1932, the Indian Village remained, and has remained, a staple on the grounds.

First Nations members and the Stampede board have occasionally met with conflict. The original location of the Indian Village was on low-lying ground that frequently flooded, a problem that was not resolved until 1974 when the village was moved to its current location. Complaints about low appearance fees paid to tipi owners, lack of input on committees related to their participation and accusations that natives were being exploited have periodically been made throughout the years. The Stoneys famously boycotted the 1950 Stampede following a rule change that cancelled a policy giving any Indigenous person free admittance upon showing their treaty card. The event that year was marred by violent thunderstorms, which led to apocryphal stories that the band had performed a rain dance in an effort to ruin the fair.

Despite the conflicts, the native communities around Calgary have been enthusiastic supporters of the Stampede and the Indian Village. The tipi owners have been long-term participants – many are third or fourth generation – and the Stampede has helped preserve and display First Nations cultures to the public. The village again relocated in 2016, doubled in size and featured a new exhibit displaying the partnership between the city, local First Nations and the Stampede.

During the 2018 Stampede, it was announced that the name of the area would be changed to reflect &quot;reconciliation and increased understanding of Indigenous peoples as modern and strong and resilient&quot;; after a voting process among the camps, it was announced on the final day of the Stampede that the Indian Village would be renamed &quot;Elbow River Camp&quot;.

===Employment and volunteerism===

Operation of the park throughout the year requires 300 full-time and 1,400 part-time employees. An additional 3,500 seasonal workers are hired for the Stampede itself. The seasonal positions are often filled by Calgary&#x27;s youth, and for many, represents their first paying jobs.
The organization is maintained by a legion of volunteers, however. Over 2,000 volunteers sit on 50 committees responsible for all aspects of the Stampede&#x27;s operation. Chief among them are the board of directors. The board is made up of 25 individuals; 20 elected from amongst the shareholders, three representing the city, one the province and the most recent president of the Stampede board. Nearly half of all volunteers have served for more than 10 years, and some as long as 60.

===Young Canadians of the Calgary Stampede===
When the Calgary Stampede brought in The Rockettes from New York City in 1964 as part of the grandstand show, they auditioned young local dancers to participate as the &quot;Calgary Kidettes&quot;. The group was meant to be a one-time addition to the show, but proved popular with spectators, and returned for three subsequent years. By 1968, the Kidettes were renamed the Young Canadians of the Calgary Stampede and remained part of the nightly grandstand show, growing into a headline act by the 1970s. The group was modeled on the American group Up with People but with a style reflecting the pioneer culture of Alberta and Western Canada. The Young Canadians made television and live appearances throughout North America and attracted large crowds every year at the Calgary Stampede. In 1982, the Stampede Foundation set up the Young Canadians School of Performing Arts to offer professional training to singers and dancers between the ages of 7 and 19, paid for by scholarships from the Stampede organization. Two of the founders of the Young Canadians were director Randy Avery and choreographer Margot McDermott who remained with the group throughout the 1970s and 80s.

==== Sexual abuse class action lawsuit and settlement ====
In 2017, a class action lawsuit with over 70 class members was launched alleging that the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede Limited and the Calgary Stampede Foundation were negligent over their failure to alert police despite being aware of sexual abuse in The Young Canadians. In 2018, a staffer with The Young Canadians was criminally convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually exploiting six members of the group between 1992 and 2014. In June 2023, the defendants reached a settlement in which they accepted liability and would pay all damages resulting from their negligence, with punitive damages to be determined later. In June 2024, the $9.5 million dollar settlement was approved by the Court of King&#x27;s Bench of Alberta.

===The Stampede Showband===
The Stampede Showband was created in 1971 to serve as the organization&#x27;s musical ambassadors. The troupe features over 150 members between the ages of 16 and 21, and has been named the world champion of marching show bands seven times, lastly being in July, 2023. The group has performed all over the world, in front of royalty and world leaders, and at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics. In 2019, the Showband performed the national anthem at the 107th Grey Cup accompanied by Young Canadians singer, Lindsey Kelly. The Showband performs year round, and make over 100 appearances during the Stampede alone. They performed in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California for the third time in 2012 as part of the Stampede&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebrations. The Showband also performed &quot;O Canada&quot; every night during the chuckwagon races with the member of the Young Canadians singing the anthem in English and French. The Stampede Showriders were created in 1985 as a precision equestrian drill team and colour guard that accompanies the Showband.

===Calgary Stampede Talent Search===
The Calgary Stampede Talent Search was created in 1981 as an annual competition for amateur artists (aged 13 to 21). Junior performers (aged 6 to 12) are showcased every evening as well. The competition takes place during the stampede and is intended to discover and develop talented young southern Albertans.

==Animal welfare==

The Stampede has attempted to balance rodeo tradition against the concerns of animal welfare groups who argue that the sport is inhumane. Officials defend the sport, calling the animals the &quot;stars of the show&quot; and stating that the Stampede is &quot;passionate about the proper treatment of animals&quot;. The Calgary Humane Society has found itself at odds with other organizations by choosing to work with the Stampede to ensure that stress on the animals is kept to a minimum. It is one of two such groups, in addition to veterinarians, who are on hand to monitor the rodeo.

Chuckwagon racing is a particular source of controversy. The World Professional Chuckwagon Association has called the Stampede&#x27;s Rangeland derby &quot;a half-mile of hell&quot;, and 65 horses had been killed in the event from 1986 to 2015. Animal rights groups protest the event, arguing that the sport causes undue suffering for the horses. Racers admit the sport is dangerous, but defend their sport amidst the controversy, arguing that the animals are well cared for, and that allowing them to race saves many horses from prematurely going to slaughter.
Following a particularly deadly series of accidents in 1986 where nine horses were killed in chuckwagon racing incidents alone – including five horses in one spectacular crash – humane society officials, fans and even some drivers called for major changes to the races, while others called for the sport to be banned entirely. Numerous rule changes were announced prior to the 1987 event. The Calgary chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accepted the changes, stating it would not call for the sport to be banned given that Stampede officials had moved to improve animal safety, further changes were announced in 2011.

Tie down roping is a particular focus of efforts to eliminate the event. The Stampede altered its policies in 2010 to enforce the rules of the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association. Additionally, the Stampede was the first rodeo to introduce a no-time penalty for competitors who make a dangerous tackle in the steer wrestling event. Several more changes were made in 2011, the rule changes were announced after six animals died at the 2010 Stampede and were met with mixed reactions from both cowboys and animal welfare groups.

Such changes have not eliminated all risks; periodic accidents have continued to result in the deaths of horses and livestock. One of the deadliest incidents in Stampede history occurred in 2005 when, late in a trail ride meant to help celebrate the province&#x27;s centennial, a group of about 200 horses spooked and in the melee nine horses were killed after they were pushed off a city bridge into the Bow River. While similar trail rides had been completed without incident in the past, Stampede officials announced they would not attempt any further rides unless they could ensure the safety of the horses.

Animal welfare groups have called animal deaths &quot;depressingly predictable&quot; and seek a boycott of the rodeo. In the United Kingdom travel agencies have been asked to stop offering tourism packages to the Stampede, and in 2010, 92 members of the UK Parliament signed an Early Day Motion asking their Canadian counterparts to ban rodeo. Several groups petitioned the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to cancel their planned attendance in 2011. However, the couple attended and participated in a private demonstration of rodeo and chuckwagon events.

=== Casualties ===
== Broadcasting ==
Live coverage of the rodeo and Rangeland Derby competitions were broadcast by the CBC Sports website and Sportsnet One. CBC Television carried daily, late-night highlight shows, and coverage on the weekend. Supplemental coverage was, until 2013, seen on CBC&#x27;s former sister cable network Bold. In 2019, U.S. sports channel CBS Sports Network aired nightly half-hour recaps covering the Stampede&#x27;s rodeo (under the &quot;PBR Summer of Rodeo&quot; banner), while CBS broadcast a one-hour highlight show of the championship on July 21. In 2021, rodeo coverage moved to Sportsnet in Canada and The Cowboy Channel in the United States.

==Community==
The festival spirit during Stampede extends throughout the city. Parade day serves as an unofficial holiday as many companies give employees half or full days off to attend. People of all walks of life, from executives to students, discard formal attire for casual western dress, typically represented by Wrangler jeans and cowboy hats. Many Calgarians have reduced productivity during the event because they take a relaxed attitude towards their usual workplace and personal responsibilities. However, the community and corporate events held during the Stampede create social networking opportunities and help newcomers acclimatize to the city. The Stampede is an important stop for political leaders as part of their annual summer tours of the country, sometimes called the barbecue circuit.

===Pancake breakfasts===

The pancake breakfast is a local institution during Stampede. Dozens are held throughout the city each day, hosted by community groups, corporations, churches, politicians and the Stampede itself. The tradition of pancake breakfasts dates back to the 1923 Stampede when a chuckwagon driver by the name of Jack Morton invited passing citizens to join him for his morning meals.

The largest is the breakfast hosted at the Chinook Centre shopping mall. Four hundred volunteers are required to feed over 60,000 people who attend the one-day event that had its 50th anniversary in 2010. Other groups, such as the Calgary Stampede Caravan, feed as many as 120,000 people over ten days. The rising popularity of the barbecue grill in the 1960s and the city&#x27;s population boom at the time brought with it the growth of community and company barbecues throughout the city during Stampede. Community booster groups have exported the tradition across the country as a symbol of Calgary&#x27;s hospitality. Among them are the Calgary Grey Cup Committee, whose volunteers have hosted pancake breakfasts on the day of the Canadian Football League championship game for over three decades, sometimes in spite of poor weather conditions for the annual November contest.

===Stampede parties===
The size and number of parties each year during Stampede is viewed as an indicator of Calgary&#x27;s economic strength. Corporations and community groups hold lavish events throughout the city for their staff and clients, while bars and pubs erect party tents, the largest of which draws up to 20,000 people per day. Paul Vickers, who owns several establishments in the city, estimates that he makes up to 20 percent of his annual revenue during the ten days of Stampede alone. Some parties have become known for heavy drinking and relaxed morals, so much so that one hotel&#x27;s satirical ad promising to safely store a patron&#x27;s wedding ring during Stampede was widely viewed as a legitimate offer. The parties are not without consequences, as lawyers have noted a significant increase in divorce filings in the weeks following the Stampede, primarily on claims of infidelity. Clinics see an increase in people seeking testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and Calgary is said to experience an annual baby boom each April – nine months after the event.

==Relationship with the city==

The Stampede has become inexorably linked to the city&#x27;s identity. Calgary has long been called the &quot;Stampede City&quot;, and carries the informal nickname of &quot;Cowtown&quot;. The event&#x27;s iconic status offers Calgary global publicity and plays a significant role in defining the city&#x27;s image. Calgary&#x27;s Canadian Football League team has been called the Stampeders since 1945, and it is a name shared by other teams in various sports throughout the city&#x27;s history, including the Stampeders hockey team that operated in the years following World War II.

The Stampede has strong polling support within the province. A 2006 Ipsos-Reid poll found that 86 percent of Albertans felt that it raised the civic quality of life and considered it one of the region&#x27;s most important cultural events. Nearly three in four stated they look forward to the annual event. However, critics argue that it is not a reflection of Alberta&#x27;s frontier history, but represents a mythical impression of western cowboy culture created by 19th-century wild west shows.

Part of the event&#x27;s success can be attributed to the close relationship the Stampede has often shared with both the civic government and community leaders. Mayors of Calgary and city aldermen have sat on the Stampede Board of Governors at the same time they occupied public office, and the Stampede&#x27;s ability to convince wealthy and influential citizens to volunteer their time has allowed the organization to gain a high-profile within the city. The Stampede operates on city-owned land, pays no property tax on its lease, and typically faces little to no political interference from City Hall. It operates as a non-profit entity with all income reinvested into the park. All improvements to the park would revert to city control if the lease were allowed to expire.

Likewise, the Stampede has support from the media, which has been accused of providing an inordinate amount of positive coverage to the event while trivializing negative aspects. The local media faced national scrutiny in 2009 when both major newspapers refused to run anti-rodeo ads sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society. While the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; simply refused to run the ad, the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; defended its position in an editorial. The &quot;Sun&quot; refuted charges it was kowtowing to the Stampede and justified its refusal by claiming &quot;we are Calgarians and allowing a group of outsiders to come in and insult a proud Calgary tradition seemed just plain wrong.&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot; reversed its decision a year later, running a full-page ad sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society.

===Economic impact and tourism===

While 70 percent of Stampede attendees are from the Calgary region, officials work to promote the event across the globe. As such, the Calgary Stampede is known around the world. The Stampede draws foreign visitors primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and is experiencing growing attendance by tourists from Asia and South America.

A 2019 Conference Board of Canada Report found the annual economic impact of the Calgary Stampede&#x27;s year-round activities generated $540.8 million across the province of Alberta. The 10-day event accounted for $282.5 million of that amount. In Calgary alone, the year-round activities of the Stampede accounted for $449.8 million. Of that, 227.4 million was generated by the 10-day Stampede.

Stampede officials estimated in 2009 that the city of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $172.4 million from the ten-day event alone, with a wider provincial total of $226.7 million. In terms of economic impact, the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada, ahead of Ottawa&#x27;s Winterlude, the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, and the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal. Additionally, Stampede officials estimate that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 in the rest of the city. A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $150–$400 over the course of the event, and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that.

===Promoting Calgary===
Civic leaders have consistently noted the Stampede&#x27;s impact on the city. Mayor Andrew Davison claimed in 1944 that the event &quot;had done more to advertise Calgary than any single agency&quot;, an opinion that has been echoed by his successors. Stampede officials have made similar claims, arguing that the event is one of Canada&#x27;s most important tourist attractions. The Canadian Tourism Commission placed the event in its Signature Experiences Collection, one of six such events or locations in Alberta.

According to Ralph Klein, former mayor of Calgary and premier of Alberta, the Stampede symbolizes the province&#x27;s spirit. He cited the friendly and welcoming attitude and festival spirit of the city&#x27;s populace during the event, which community booster groups export around the world. Among examples cited was the infamous 1948 Grey Cup game in which two trains of Stampeder football fans descended on Toronto and launched an unprecedented series of celebrations before, during and after the game that included riding a horse into the lobby of the Royal York Hotel. The events helped turn the Grey Cup into a national festival and the largest single-day sporting event in the country.

<text>A team is a group of individuals (human or non-human) working together to achieve their goal.

As defined by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management, &quot;[a] team is a group of people who are interdependent with respect to information, resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to combine their efforts to achieve a common goal&quot;.

A group does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have members with complementary skills
and generate synergy
through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Naresh Jain (2009) claims:
Team members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond their limitations.
While academic research on teams and teamwork has grown consistently and has shown a sharp increase over the past recent 40 years, the societal diffusion of teams and teamwork actually followed a volatile trend in the 20th century. The concept was introduced into business in the late 20th century, which was followed by a popularization of the concept of constructing teams. Differing opinions exist on the efficacy of this new management fad.
Some see &quot;team&quot; as a four-letter word: overused and under-useful.

Others see it as a panacea that realizes the Human Relations Movement&#x27;s desire to integrate what that movement perceives as best for workers and as best for managers.

Many people believe in the effectiveness of teams, but also see them as dangerous because of the potential for exploiting workers — in that team effectiveness can rely on peer pressure and peer surveillance.
However, Hackman sees team effectiveness not only in terms of performance: a truly effective team will contribute to the personal well-being and adaptive growth of its members.

English-speakers commonly use the word &quot;team&quot; in today&#x27;s society to characterise many types of groups. Peter Guy Northouse&#x27;s book &quot;Leadership: theory and practice&quot;
discusses teams from a leadership perspective. According to the team approach to leadership, a team is a type of organizational group of people that are members. A team is composed of members who are dependent on each other, work towards interchangeable achievements, and share common attainments. A team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. A team is usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a kind of organization, company, or community. Teams can meet in-person (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and activities or duties. A team&#x27;s communication is significantly important to their relationship. Ergo, communication is frequent and persistent, and as well are the meetings. The definition of team as an organizational group is not completely set in stone, as organizations have confronted a myriad of new forms of contemporary collaboration. Teams usually have strong organizational structured platforms and respond quickly and efficiently to challenges as they have skills and the capability to do so. An effective organizational team leads to greater productivity, more effective implementation of resources, better decisions and problem-solving, better-quality products/service, and greater innovation and originality.

Alongside the concept of a team, compare the more structured/skilled concept of a crew, the advantages of formal and informal partnerships, or the well-defined – but time-limited – existence of task forces.

A team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.

Thus teams of game players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft/sport. Transport logistics executives can select teams of horses, dogs, or oxen for the purpose of conveying passengers or goods.

==Types==
Of particular importance is the concept of different types of teams.

===Categories by subject===

Although the concept of a team is relatively simple, social scientists have identified many different types of teams. In general, teams either act as information processors, or take on a more active role in the task and actually perform activities. Common categories and subtypes of teams include:

====Action teams====
An action team is a group of people with leadership skills. It devises strategies, analyze situations and execute needed actions.

====Advisory teams====
Advisory teams make suggestions about a final product (Devine, 2002). For instance, a quality-control group on an assembly line would be an example of an advisory team: they may examine the products produced and make suggestions about how to improve the quality of the items being made. A product reaches the final stage and is put for sales after getting approved by the advisory teams. The advisory team consists of experts who possess extraordinary skills.

====Command team====
The goal of the command team is to combine instructions and to coordinate action among management. In other words, command teams serve as the &quot;middle man&quot; in tasks (Devine, 2002). For instance, messengers on a construction site, conveying instructions from the executive team to the builders, would be an example of a command team.

==== Executive team ====
An executive team is a management team that draws up plans for activities and then directs these activities (Devine, 2002). An example of an executive team would be a construction team designing blueprints for a new building, and then guiding the construction of the building using these blueprints.

==== Project teams ====

A team used only for a defined period of time and for a separate, concretely definable purpose, often becomes known as a project team. This category of team includes negotiation-, commission- and design-team subtypes. In general, these types of teams are multi-talented and composed of individuals with expertise in many different areas. Members of these teams might belong to different groups, but receive assignment to activities for the same project, thereby allowing outsiders to view them as a single unit. In this way, setting up a team allegedly facilitates the creation, tracking and assignment of a group of people based on the project in hand. The use of the &quot;team&quot; label in this instance often has no relationship to whether the employees work as a team.

Lundin and Soderholm define project teams as a special case in the more general category of temporary organizations which also includes task forces, program committees, and action groups. All of these are formed to &quot;make things happen&quot;. This emphasis on action leads to a demarcation between the temporary organization and its environment. The demarcation is driven by four interrelated concepts (the four T&#x27;s):
#Time – the time horizons and limits are crucial to the existence of temporary organizations &quot;whose very existence helps spread a sense of urgency&quot;.
#Task – the raison d` ètre for the temporary organization; no other party is attending to the same task at the same time in the same way
#Team – provides the human resources to accomplish the task in the time available
#Transition – an accomplishment or some sort of qualitative difference is expected after the time horizon
&quot;The concepts also differ from the crucial concepts that define the permanent organization. Permanent organizations are more naturally defined by goals (rather than tasks), survival (rather than time), working organization (rather than team) and production processes and continual development (rather than transition)&quot;
====Sports teams====

A sports team is a group of people which play sports (often team sports) together. Members include all players (even those who are waiting their turn to play), as well as support members such as a team manager or coach.

====Virtual teams====

Developments in information and communications technology have seen the emergence of the virtual work-team. A virtual team is a group of people who work interdependently and with shared purpose across space, time, and organisational boundaries using technology to communicate and collaborate. Virtual team members can be located across a country or across the world, rarely meet face-to-face, and include members from different cultures.

In their 2009 literature-review paper, Ale Ebrahim, N., Ahmed, S. and Taha, Z. added two key issues to definition of a virtual team: &quot;as small temporary groups of geographically, organizationally and/ or time dispersed knowledge workers who coordinate their work predominantly with electronic information and communication technologies in order to accomplish one or more organization tasks&quot;. Many virtual teams are solving customer problems or generating new work processes.

====Work teams====
Work teams are responsible for the actual act of creating tangible products and services (Devine, 2002). The actual workers on an assembly line would be an example of a production team, whereas waiters and waitresses at a diner would be an example of a service team.

===Interdependent and independent===
One common distinction is drawn between interdependent and independent teams. The difference is determined by the actions that the team members take while working.

====Interdependent teams====

A rugby team provides a clear example of an interdependent team:

* no significant task can be accomplished without the help and cooperation of every member;
* within their team members typically specialize in different tasks (r.r the ball, goal kicking and scrum feeding), and
* the success of every individual is inextricably bound to the success of the whole team. No rugby player, no matter how talented, has ever won a game by playing alone.

====Independent teams====
On the other hand, a track-and-field team is a classic example of an independent team:

* races are run, or points are scored, by individuals or by partners
* every person in a given job performs basically the same actions
* how one player performs has no direct effect on the performance of the next player

If all team members each perform the same basic tasks, such as students working problems in a maths class, or outside sales employees making phone calls, then it is likely that this team is an independent team. They may be able to help each other—perhaps by offering advice or practice time, by providing moral support, or by helping in the background during a busy time—but each individual&#x27;s success is primarily due to each individual&#x27;s own efforts. Runners do not win their own races merely because the rest of their teammates did, and maths students do not pass tests merely because their neighbours know how to solve equations.

In the business environment, sales teams and traditional professionals (such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers), work in independent teams. Most teams in a business setting are independent teams.

====Coaching differences between interdependent and independent teams====
Coaching an interdependent team like a football team necessarily requires a different approach from coaching an independent team like a gymnastics team, because the costs and benefits to individual team members—and therefore the intrinsic incentives for positive team behaviors—differ markedly. An interdependent team benefits from members getting to know the other team members socially, from developing trust in each other, and from conquering artificial collective challenges (such as those offered in outdoors ropes courses). Interdependent teams respond well to collective rewards, and independent teams perform better with individual rewards.

Hybrid teams and hybrid rewards, which try to combine characteristics of both, are sometimes created in the hope of getting the best of both types. However, instead, they tend instead to produce the negative features of each and none of the benefits, and consequently under-perform.

Pressuring teams to become independent or interdependent, on the grounds that management has decided that one type is intrinsically better than the other, results in failure. The nature of the team is defined by the type of work that is done, and not by management&#x27;s wishes or by the fashions of the latest management fad.

===Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary===
Teams in areas of work or study such as in the medical field, may be &quot;multidisciplinary&quot; or &quot;interdisciplinary&quot;.

Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have, focusing on the issues in which they specialise. The problems that are being treated may or may not relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members.

The interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal. In an interdisciplinary team approach, members of the core team will often rôle-blend, taking on tasks usually filled by people in different roles on the team.

===Self-directing or self-designing teams===
These types of teams result in the highest potential for innovative work and motivation among its members. Team members determine the team&#x27;s objectives and the means to achieve them. The management&#x27;s only responsibility among self-directing teams is the creating the team&#x27;s organizational context. Self-directed teams offer the most potential for innovation, enhance goal commitment and motivation, and provide opportunity for organizational learning and change.

==Team size, composition, and formation==
Team size and team composition affect team processes and team outcomes. The optimal size (and composition) of teams is debated and will vary depending on the task at hand. At least one study of problem-solving in groups showed an optimal size of groups at four members. Other works estimate the optimal size between 5–12 members or a number of members that can consume two pizzas. The following extract is taken from Chong (2007):

:The interest in teams gained momentum in the 1980s with the publication of Belbin&#x27;s (1981) work on successful teams. The research into teams and teamwork followed two lines of inquiry. Writers such as Belbin (1981, 1993), Woodcock (1989), Margerison and McCann (1990), Davis et al. (1992), Parker (1990), and Spencer and Pruss (1992) focused on team roles and how these affected team performance. These studies suggested that team performance was a function of the number and type of roles team members played. The number of roles for optimal performance varied from 15 (Davis et al., 1992) to four (Parker, 1990). This variation has been attributed to how roles were defined. Lindgren (1997) believed that, in a social psychological sense, ‘roles’ were behaviours one exhibited within the constraints assigned by the outside world to one&#x27;s occupational position e.g. leader, manager, supervisor, worker etc. Personality traits, on the other hand, were internally driven and relatively stable over time and across situations. These traits affected behavioural patterns in predictable ways (Pervin, 1989) and, in varying degrees, become part of the ‘role’ definition as well.
:The other line of inquiry focused on measuring the ‘effectiveness’ of teams. Writers such as Deihl and Stroebe (1987), Gersik (1988), Evenden and Anderson (1992), Furnham et al. (1993), Cohen and Ledford (1994) and Katzenbach (1998) were concerned with high performing teams and the objective measurement of their effectiveness. McFadzean (2002) believed that the appearance of a number of models of team effectiveness was indicative of a variety of variables such as personality, group size, work norms, status relationships, group structure etc. that can impact on team ‘effectiveness’ and its measurement.

David Cooperrider suggests that the larger the group, the better. This is because a larger group is able to address concerns of the whole system. So while a large team may be ineffective at performing a given task, Cooperider says that the relevance of that task should be considered, because determining whether the team is effective first requires identifying what needs to be accomplished.
Regarding composition, all teams will have an element of homogeneity and heterogeneity. The more homogeneous the group, the more cohesive it will be. The more heterogeneous the group, the greater the differences in perspective and increased potential for creativity, but also the greater potential for conflict.

Team members normally have different roles, like team leader and agents. Large teams can divide into subteams according to need.

Many teams go through a life-cycle of stages, identified by Bruce Tuckman as: forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning.

== Team cognition ==

Team cognition has been defined as an &quot;emergent state that refers to the manner in which knowledge important to team functioning is organized, represented, and distributed within team.&quot; This emergent state can manifest in two ways. Compositional emergence occurs when individual level cognition is similar in form and function to its manifestation at team-level. Compilational emergence, on the other hand, represents a greater degree of synergy among team members and represents a new-team level construct. As such, higher degrees of compilational emergence are more closely related to team process and performance than is compositional emergence.

Research into team cognition has focused on how teams develop mental models and transactive memory systems. Mental models refer to the degree in which team members have similar cognitive understanding of the situation and performance goals which include shared representations of the task. Transactive memory systems relate to how knowledge is distributed among team members and retrieved in a coordinated fashion, the way that team member rely on knowledge that is possessed by other members and how knowledge sets are differentiated within a team. The emergence of team cognition is thought to impact team effectiveness because it can positively affect a team&#x27;s behavioural process, motivational states, and performance.

Team cognition consists of two broad types of content. Task related models are related to knowledge of the major duties and resources possessed by the team. Team-related models refer to interactions and interdependence among the team members.

==Team effectiveness ==

When companies are in trouble, they often restructure into teams. However, putting people into teams does not solve problems; if not done thoughtfully, this may even cause more problems. The formation of teams is most appropriate for tasks that are difficult, complex and important. These types of tasks are often beyond the skills and abilities of any single individual. However, the formation of a team to complete such tasks does not guarantee success. Rather, the proper implementation of teams is positively related to both member satisfaction and increased effectiveness. Organizations who want to receive the benefits afforded by teams need to carefully consider how teams are built and implemented. Often, teams are created without providing members any training to develop the skills necessary to perform well in a team setting. This is critical, because teamwork can be cognitively and interpersonally demanding. Even when a team consists of talented individuals, these individuals must learn to coordinate their actions and develop functional interpersonal interactions. In their review of the relevant scientific literature, Kozlowski and Ilgen demonstrated that such training can greatly benefit team effectiveness. Finally, teams are more likely to be successful when they are fully supported by the organization. Take for example New United Motor Manufacturing Inc (NUMMI). Originally it was a General Motors automotive manufacturing plant that had to close due to numerous issues, causing it to be the worst performing GM plant. NUMMI was the collaborative creation of General Motors and Toyota. These two companies took most of the same work force and created one of the most productive automotive plants, producing high quality cars. They did this by implementing a new team structure, where management and the company was more supportive of the union workforce.

==Not all groups are teams==
Some people use the word &quot;team&quot; when they mean &quot;employees&quot;. A &quot;sales team&quot; is a common example of this loose or perhaps euphemistic usage, though inter-dependencies exist in organisations, and a sales group can be let down by poor performance in other parts of the organisation upon which sales depend, like delivery, after-sales service, etc. However &quot;sales staff&quot; is a more accurate description of the typical arrangement.

Groups develop into teams in four stages:

# dependency and inclusion
# counter dependency and fighting
# trust and structure
# work

In the first stage, group development is characterized by members&#x27; dependency on the designated leader (identical to &#x27;Forming&#x27; in Tuckman&#x27;s model). In the second stage, the group seeks to free itself from its dependence on the leader and groups have conflicts about goals and procedures (identical to &#x27;Storming&#x27; in Tuckman&#x27;s model). In the third stage, the group manages to work through the conflicts (identical to &#x27;Norming&#x27; in Tuckman&#x27;s model). And in the last stage, groups focus on team productivity (identical to &#x27;Performing&#x27; in Tuckman&#x27;s model).

One aspect of teams that can set them apart from other groups is their level of autonomy. Hackman developed a hierarchical model of team autonomy which consists of four levels of team self-management. It is imagined along a continuum, starting with a manager-led team in which team members complete the required tasks but someone outside the team performs the executive functions. As the person&#x27;s job it is who performs the executive functions is to define the goals and methods for the team, the team itself holds the sole responsibility of the execution of the work that needs to be performed. Next in the hierarchy are self-managing teams, followed by self-designing teams. Finally, at the top of the hierarchy, come self-governing teams. The model describes four different types of control that fully self-governing teams can possess. These include control over the execution of the task, monitoring and managing work processes, control over the design and performance of a team, and setting the overall direction of the team.

To understand how teams deliver extra performance, we need to distinguish between teams and working groups. A working group&#x27;s performance is made up of the individual results of all its individual members. A team&#x27;s performance is made up of both individual results and collective results. Teams produce work products/results though the joint contributions of team members. This is what makes the team&#x27;s collective performance greater than the sum of all individual members’ best performance. In short, a team is more than the sum of its parts.

== Leadership ==
The “team” portion of team leadership is based on individuals and how each share the work between one another. First, individuals must see that they are a team, not simply a group. Each member takes on a portion of the group&#x27;s leadership and responsibility. Each member helps other members to see their strengths and how they complement each other.

Second, the team sets result driven goals. To achieve this, the designated leader guides the team based decision making process. The team clarifies or agrees on attainable goals. Additionally, they agree on steps to obtain them. Furthermore, the team determines if they need to take an immediate action, or if they can simply watch a situation for a period of time.

Third, if the team decides to take an action, it may be something they change internally, such as clarifying their goals, receiving training, collaborating, or building commitment as a team. If not internally, this action can be something they will act on outside of the team, such as networking with others or negotiating for support.

Lastly, the team&#x27;s leader will contribute by finding ways to improve team work. This may be done through questionnaires given to the team. These can address any problems, or seek avenues the team would like to see improved. A strength of the team is its continuous stride for improvement and openness to interventional assistance.

In Leadership – Theory and Practice 7th Edition by Peter G. Northouse, he states that, “A team is a type of organizational group that is composed of members who are interdependent, who share common goals, and who must coordinate their activities to accomplish these goals,” (Northouse, 363). Overall, the team will lead each other to bring forth their own individual ideas and strengths, which create opportunities for great success.

A common myth is that to function effectively, teams need a strong, powerful, and charismatic leader. In general, leaders who control all the details, manage alle the key relationships in the team, have all the good ideas, and use the team to execute their &quot;vision&quot; are usually overworked and underproductive.

Teams are in need of transformational leaders not more managers, with the important caveat that the world does not function well without managers. Transformational leaders engage in the following behaviors:

* Idealized Influence: The ability to engage other people by your actions. They like the way that you do things, they like the way the you treat people, and they like your approach to problems. Charisma is often associated with idealized influence.
* Inspirational Motivation: The ability to inspire others with your vision. Those who lead with inspirational motivation will enable their followers to achieve things they did not believe were possible.
* Intellectual Stimulation: The ability to stimulate others to be creative and challenge preconceptions they possess. This behavior enables a leader to tap into creativity as a competitive advantage.
* Individualized Consideration: The ability to truly know those that you wish to lead. This behavior enables leaders to realize and draw out the full potential of others.

Opus numbers are used to distinguish among compositions with similar titles; the word is abbreviated as &quot;Op.&quot; for a single work, or &quot;Opp.&quot; when referring to more than one work. Opus numbers do not necessarily indicate chronological order of composition. For example, posthumous publications of a composer&#x27;s juvenilia are often numbered after other works, even though they may be some of the composer&#x27;s first completed works.

To indicate the specific place of a given work within a music catalogue, the opus number is paired with a cardinal number; for example, Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor (1801, nicknamed &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;) is &quot;Opus 27, No. 2&quot;, whose work-number identifies it as a companion piece to &quot;Opus 27, No. 1&quot; (Piano Sonata No. 13 in E-flat major, 1800–01), paired in same opus number, with both being subtitled &quot;Sonata quasi una Fantasia&quot;, the only two of the kind in all of Beethoven&#x27;s 32 piano sonatas. Furthermore, the &quot;Piano Sonata, Op. 27 No. 2, in C-sharp minor&quot; is also catalogued as &quot;Sonata No. 14&quot;, because it is the fourteenth sonata composed by Ludwig van Beethoven.

Given composers&#x27; inconsistent or non-existent assignment of opus numbers, especially during the Baroque (1600–1750) and the Classical (1750–1827) eras, musicologists have developed other catalogue-number systems; among them the &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; (BWV-number) and the &quot;Köchel-Verzeichnis&quot; (K- and KV-numbers), which enumerate the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, respectively.

==Etymology==
In the classical period, the Latin word &quot;opus&quot; (&quot;work&quot;, &quot;labour&quot;), plural &quot;opera&quot;, was used to identify, list, and catalogue a work of art.

By the 15th and 16th centuries, the word &quot;opus&quot; was used by Italian composers to denote a specific musical composition, and by German composers for collections of music. In compositional practice, numbering musical works in chronological order dates from 17th-century Italy, especially Venice. In common usage, the word &quot;opus&quot; is used to describe the best work of an artist with the term &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

In Latin, the words &quot;opus&quot; (singular) and &quot;opera&quot; (plural) are related to the words &quot;opera&quot; (singular) and &quot;operae&quot; (plural), which gave rise to the Italian words &quot;opera&quot; (singular) and &quot;opere&quot; (plural), likewise meaning &quot;work&quot;. In contemporary English, the word &quot;opera&quot; has specifically come to denote the dramatic musical genres of opera or ballet, which were developed in Italy. As a result, the plural &quot;opera&quot; of &quot;opus&quot; tends to be avoided in English. In other languages such as German, however, it remains common.

==Early usage==
In the arts, an opus number usually denotes a work of musical composition, a practice and usage established in the seventeenth century when composers identified their works with an opus number. In the eighteenth century, publishers usually assigned opus numbers when publishing groups of like compositions, usually in sets of three, six or twelve compositions. Consequently, opus numbers are not usually in chronological order, unpublished compositions usually had no opus number, and numeration gaps and sequential duplications occurred when publishers issued contemporaneous editions of a composer&#x27;s works, as in the sets of string quartets by Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827); Haydn&#x27;s Op. 76, the Erdödy quartets (1796–97), comprises six discrete quartets consecutively numbered Op. 76 No. 1 – Op. 76 No. 6; whilst Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 59, the Rasumovsky quartets (1805–06), comprises String Quartet No. 7, String Quartet No. 8, and String Quartet No. 9.

==19th century to date==
From about 1800, composers usually assigned an opus number to a work or set of works upon publication. After approximately 1900, they tended to assign an opus number to a composition whether published or not. However, practices were not always perfectly consistent or logical. For example, early in his career, Beethoven selectively numbered his compositions (some published without opus numbers), yet in later years, he published early works with high opus numbers. Likewise, some posthumously published works were given high opus numbers by publishers, even though some of them were written early in Beethoven&#x27;s career. Since his death in 1827, the un-numbered compositions have been cataloged and labeled with the German acronym WoO (&quot;Werk ohne Opuszahl&quot;), meaning &quot;work without opus number&quot;; the same has been done with other composers who used opus numbers. (There are also other catalogs of Beethoven&#x27;s works – see Catalogues of Beethoven compositions.)

The practice of enumerating a posthumous opus (&quot;Op. posth.&quot;) is noteworthy in the case of Felix Mendelssohn (1809–47); after his death, the heirs published many compositions with opus numbers that Mendelssohn did not assign. In life, he published two symphonies (Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 11; and Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 56), furthermore he published his symphony-cantata &quot;Lobgesang&quot;, Op. 52, which was posthumously counted as his Symphony No. 2; yet, he chronologically wrote symphonies between symphonies Nos. 1 and 2, which he withdrew for personal and compositional reasons; nevertheless, the Mendelssohn heirs published (and cataloged) them as the &quot; Italian&quot; Symphony No. 4 in A major, Op. 90, and as the &quot; Reformation&quot; Symphony No. 5 in D major and D minor, Op. 107.

While many of the works of Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904) were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical relationship to the order in which the works were written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers, such as N. Simrock, preferred to present less experienced composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák gave lower opus numbers to new works to be able to sell them to other publishers outside his contract obligations. This way it could happen that the same opus number was given to more than one of his works. Opus number 12, for example, was assigned, successively, to five different works (an opera, a concert overture, a string quartet, and two unrelated piano works). In other cases, the same work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers. The sequential numbering of his symphonies has also been confused: (a) they were initially numbered by order of publication, not composition; (b) the first four symphonies to be composed were published after the last five; and (c) the last five symphonies were not published in order of composition. The &quot;New World Symphony&quot; originally was published as No. 5, later was known as No. 8, and definitively was renumbered as No. 9 in the critical editions published in the 1950s.

Other examples of composers&#x27; historically inconsistent opus-number usages include the cases of César Franck (1822–1890), Béla Bartók (1881–1945), and Alban Berg (1885–1935), who initially numbered, but then stopped numbering their compositions. Carl Nielsen (1865–1931) and Paul Hindemith (1895–1963) were also inconsistent in their approaches. Sergei Prokofiev (1891–1953) was consistent and assigned an opus number to a composition &quot;before&quot; composing it; at his death, he left fragmentary and planned, but numbered, works. In revising a composition, Prokofiev occasionally assigned a new opus number to the revision; thus Symphony No. 4 is two thematically related but discrete works: Symphony No. 4, Op. 47, written in 1929; and Symphony No. 4, Op. 112, a large-scale revision written in 1947. Likewise, depending upon the edition, the original version of Piano Sonata No. 5 in C major, is cataloged both as Op. 38 and as Op. 135.

Despite being used in more or less normal fashion by a number of important early-twentieth-century composers, including Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) and Anton Webern (1883–1945), opus numbers became less common in the later part of the twentieth century.

==Other catalogues==

To manage inconsistent opus-number usages – especially by composers of the Baroque (1600–1750) and of the Classical (1720–1830) music eras – musicologists have developed comprehensive and unambiguous catalogue number-systems for the works of composers such as:

* Johann Sebastian Bach – catalogued with a BWV-number; a &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; number assigned by Wolfgang Schmieder; however, older sources occasionally use S-numbers.
* Dietrich Buxtehude – catalogued with a BuxWV-number, a &quot;Buxtehude-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; work number.
*Marc-Antoine Charpentier– identified with an H-number per H.W. Hitchcock&#x27;s comprehensive catalogue.
* Frédéric Chopin – four catalogue systems have been applied: (i) B-numbers, by Maurice J. E. Brown; (ii) KK-numbers, by Krystyna Kobylańska; (iii) work-letters (A, C, D, E, P and S), by Józef Michał Chomiński; and (iv) WN-numbers in the Chopin National Edition. Generally, these alternative music-catalogue systems identified compositions that the composer had not numbered.
* Claude Debussy – identified with an L-number, per François Lesure&#x27;s comprehensive catalogue.
* Antonín Dvořák – identified with a B-number, per Jarmil Burghauser&#x27;s comprehensive catalogue; which resolved the problems of different and duplicate opus-numbers assigned by the publishers of Dvořák&#x27;s music.
* Joseph Haydn – identified with a Hob.-number, per the 1957 catalogue by Anthony van Hoboken. Although he assigned Hoboken-numbers to the string quartets, those compositions usually are known by opus numbers.
* Franz Liszt – identified with an S-number, per the catalogue &quot;The Music of Liszt&quot; (1960), by Humphrey Searle.
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart – identified either with a K-number or with a KV-number (&quot;Köchel-Verzeichnis nummer&quot;), per the catalogue system of Ludwig Ritter von Köchel.
* Niccolò Paganini – identified with an MS-number, per the 1982 &quot;Catalogo tematico&quot;, by Moretti and Sorrento.
* Domenico Scarlatti – identified with three catalogue systems; (i) L-numbers, per the 1906 catalogue by Alessandro Longo; (ii) K-numbers and Kk-numbers, per the 1953 catalogue by Ralph Kirkpatrick; and (iii) P-numbers, per the 1967 catalogue by Giorgio Pestelli.
* Franz Schubert – identified with a D-number, per the catalogue of Otto Erich Deutsch.
* Maurice Ravel – identified with an M-number, per the 1986 catalogue by Marcel Marnat.
* Henry Purcell – identified with a Z-number, per the catalogue by Franklin B. Zimmerman.
* Antonio Vivaldi – identified with a RV number, per the Ryom-Verzeichnis catalogue by Peter Ryom.
* Gustav Holst – identified with an H. catalogue number, per A Thematic Catalogue of Gustav Holst&#x27;s Music by Imogen Holst.

<doc id="140806" wikidata="Q1045555" url="?curid=140806" title="Maximum likelihood estimation">
<text>In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate. The logic of maximum likelihood is both intuitive and flexible, and as such the method has become a dominant means of statistical inference.

If the likelihood function is differentiable, the derivative test for finding maxima can be applied. In some cases, the first-order conditions of the likelihood function can be solved analytically; for instance, the ordinary least squares estimator for a linear regression model maximizes the likelihood when the random errors are assumed to have normal distributions with the same variance.

From the perspective of Bayesian inference, MLE is generally equivalent to maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with a prior distribution that is uniform in the region of interest. In frequentist inference, MLE is a special case of an extremum estimator, with the objective function being the likelihood.

== Principles ==

We model a set of observations as a random sample from an unknown joint probability distribution which is expressed in terms of a set of parameters. The goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to determine the parameters for which the observed data have the highest joint probability. We write the parameters governing the joint distribution as a vector formula_1 so that this distribution falls within a parametric family formula_2 where formula_3 is called the &quot;parameter space&quot;, a finite-dimensional subset of Euclidean space. Evaluating the joint density at the observed data sample formula_4 gives a real-valued function,
formula_5
which is called the likelihood function. For independent and identically distributed random variables, formula_6 will be the product of univariate density functions:
formula_7

The goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the values of the model parameters that maximize the likelihood function over the parameter space, that is
formula_8
Intuitively, this selects the parameter values that make the observed data most probable. The specific value formula_9 that maximizes the likelihood function formula_10 is called the maximum likelihood estimate. Further, if the function formula_11 so defined is measurable, then it is called the maximum likelihood estimator. It is generally a function defined over the sample space, i.e. taking a given sample as its argument. A sufficient but not necessary condition for its existence is for the likelihood function to be continuous over a parameter space formula_3 that is compact. For an open formula_3 the likelihood function may increase without ever reaching a supremum value.

In practice, it is often convenient to work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, called the log-likelihood:
formula_14
Since the logarithm is a monotonic function, the maximum of formula_15 occurs at the same value of formula_16 as does the maximum of formula_17 If formula_18 is differentiable in formula_19 sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a maximum (or a minimum) are
formula_20
known as the likelihood equations. For some models, these equations can be explicitly solved for formula_21 but in general no closed-form solution to the maximization problem is known or available, and an MLE can only be found via numerical optimization. Another problem is that in finite samples, there may exist multiple roots for the likelihood equations. Whether the identified root formula_22 of the likelihood equations is indeed a (local) maximum depends on whether the matrix of second-order partial and cross-partial derivatives, the so-called Hessian matrix

formula_23

is negative semi-definite at formula_24, as this indicates local concavity. Conveniently, most common probability distributions – in particular the exponential family – are logarithmically concave.

=== Restricted parameter space ===

While the domain of the likelihood function—the parameter space—is generally a finite-dimensional subset of Euclidean space, additional restrictions sometimes need to be incorporated into the estimation process. The parameter space can be expressed as
formula_25

where formula_26 is a vector-valued function mapping formula_27 into formula_28 Estimating the true parameter formula_16 belonging to formula_30 then, as a practical matter, means to find the maximum of the likelihood function subject to the constraint formula_31

Theoretically, the most natural approach to this constrained optimization problem is the method of substitution, that is &quot;filling out&quot; the restrictions formula_32 to a set formula_33 in such a way that formula_34 is a one-to-one function from formula_35 to itself, and reparameterize the likelihood function by setting formula_36 Because of the equivariance of the maximum likelihood estimator, the properties of the MLE apply to the restricted estimates also. For instance, in a multivariate normal distribution the covariance matrix formula_37 must be positive-definite; this restriction can be imposed by replacing formula_38 where formula_39 is a real upper triangular matrix and formula_40 is its transpose.

In practice, restrictions are usually imposed using the method of Lagrange which, given the constraints as defined above, leads to the &quot;restricted likelihood equations&quot;
formula_41 and formula_42 

where formula_43 is a column-vector of Lagrange multipliers and formula_44 is the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives. Naturally, if the constraints are not binding at the maximum, the Lagrange multipliers should be zero. This in turn allows for a statistical test of the &quot;validity&quot; of the constraint, known as the Lagrange multiplier test.

=== Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation ===
Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation can be performed using the empirical likelihood.

== Properties ==
A maximum likelihood estimator is an extremum estimator obtained by maximizing, as a function of &quot;θ&quot;, the objective function formula_45. If the data are independent and identically distributed, then we have 
formula_46
this being the sample analogue of the expected log-likelihood formula_47, where this expectation is taken with respect to the true density.

Maximum-likelihood estimators have no optimum properties for finite samples, in the sense that (when evaluated on finite samples) other estimators may have greater concentration around the true parameter-value. However, like other estimation methods, maximum likelihood estimation possesses a number of attractive limiting properties: As the sample size increases to infinity, sequences of maximum likelihood estimators have these properties:
* Consistency: the sequence of MLEs converges in probability to the value being estimated.
* Equivariance: If formula_48 is the maximum likelihood estimator for formula_49, and if formula_50 is a bijective transform of formula_49, then the maximum likelihood estimator for formula_52 is formula_53. The equivariance property can be generalized to non-bijective transforms, although it applies in that case on the maximum of an induced likelihood function which is not the true likelihood in general.
* Efficiency, i.e. it achieves the Cramér–Rao lower bound when the sample size tends to infinity. This means that no consistent estimator has lower asymptotic mean squared error than the MLE (or other estimators attaining this bound), which also means that MLE has asymptotic normality.
* Second-order efficiency after correction for bias.

=== Consistency ===
Under the conditions outlined below, the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent. The consistency means that if the data were generated by formula_54 and we have a sufficiently large number of observations &quot;n&quot;, then it is possible to find the value of &quot;θ&quot;0 with arbitrary precision. In mathematical terms this means that as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity the estimator formula_24 converges in probability to its true value:
formula_56

Under slightly stronger conditions, the estimator converges almost surely (or &quot;strongly&quot;):
formula_57

In practical applications, data is never generated by formula_54. Rather, formula_54 is a model, often in idealized form, of the process generated by the data. It is a common aphorism in statistics that &quot;all models are wrong&quot;. Thus, true consistency does not occur in practical applications. Nevertheless, consistency is often considered to be a desirable property for an estimator to have.

To establish consistency, the following conditions are sufficient.
\ 0. &lt;/math&gt;

The dominance condition can be employed in the case of i.i.d. observations. In the non-i.i.d. case, the uniform convergence in probability can be checked by showing that the sequence formula_60 is stochastically equicontinuous.

If one wants to demonstrate that the ML estimator formula_24 converges to &quot;θ&quot;0 almost surely, then a stronger condition of uniform convergence almost surely has to be imposed:
formula_62

Additionally, if (as assumed above) the data were generated by formula_54, then under certain conditions, it can also be shown that the maximum likelihood estimator converges in distribution to a normal distribution. Specifically,
formula_64
where is the Fisher information matrix.

=== Functional invariance ===
The maximum likelihood estimator selects the parameter value which gives the observed data the largest possible probability (or probability density, in the continuous case). If the parameter consists of a number of components, then we define their separate maximum likelihood estimators, as the corresponding component of the MLE of the complete parameter. Consistent with this, if formula_24 is the MLE for formula_16, and if formula_67 is any transformation of formula_16, then the MLE for formula_69 is by definition

formula_70

It maximizes the so-called profile likelihood:

formula_71

The MLE is also equivariant with respect to certain transformations of the data. If formula_72 where formula_73 is one to one and does not depend on the parameters to be estimated, then the density functions satisfy

formula_74

and hence the likelihood functions for formula_75 and formula_76 differ only by a factor that does not depend on the model parameters.

For example, the MLE parameters of the log-normal distribution are the same as those of the normal distribution fitted to the logarithm of the data. In fact, in the log-normal case if formula_77, then formula_78 follows a log-normal distribution. The density of Y follows with formula_79 standard Normal and formula_80, formula_81 for formula_82.

=== Efficiency ===
As assumed above, if the data were generated by formula_83 then under certain conditions, it can also be shown that the maximum likelihood estimator converges in distribution to a normal distribution. It is -consistent and asymptotically efficient, meaning that it reaches the Cramér–Rao bound. Specifically,

formula_84
where formula_85 is the Fisher information matrix:
formula_86

In particular, it means that the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator is equal to zero up to the order .

=== Second-order efficiency after correction for bias ===
However, when we consider the higher-order terms in the expansion of the distribution of this estimator, it turns out that has bias of order . This bias is equal to (componentwise)

formula_87

where formula_88 (with superscripts) denotes the (&quot;j,k&quot;)-th component of the &quot;inverse&quot; Fisher information matrix formula_89, and

formula_90

Using these formulae it is possible to estimate the second-order bias of the maximum likelihood estimator, and &quot;correct&quot; for that bias by subtracting it:
formula_91
This estimator is unbiased up to the terms of order , and is called the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator.

This bias-corrected estimator is (at least within the curved exponential family), meaning that it has minimal mean squared error among all second-order bias-corrected estimators, up to the terms of the order  . It is possible to continue this process, that is to derive the third-order bias-correction term, and so on. However, the maximum likelihood estimator is &quot;not&quot; third-order efficient.

=== Relation to Bayesian inference ===
A maximum likelihood estimator coincides with the most probable Bayesian estimator given a uniform prior distribution on the parameters. Indeed, the maximum a posteriori estimate is the parameter that maximizes the probability of given the data, given by Bayes&#x27; theorem:

formula_92

where formula_93 is the prior distribution for the parameter and where formula_94 is the probability of the data averaged over all parameters. Since the denominator is independent of , the Bayesian estimator is obtained by maximizing formula_95 with respect to . If we further assume that the prior formula_93 is a uniform distribution, the Bayesian estimator is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function formula_97. Thus the Bayesian estimator coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for a uniform prior distribution formula_93.

==== Application of maximum-likelihood estimation in Bayes decision theory ====
In many practical applications in machine learning, maximum-likelihood estimation is used as the model for parameter estimation.

The Bayesian Decision theory is about designing a classifier that minimizes total expected risk, especially, when the costs (the loss function) associated with different decisions are equal, the classifier is minimizing the error over the whole distribution.

Thus, the Bayes Decision Rule is stated as
:&quot;decide formula_99 if formula_100 otherwise decide formula_101&quot;
where formula_102 are predictions of different classes. From a perspective of minimizing error, it can also be stated as
formula_103
where
formula_104
if we decide formula_101 and formula_106 if we decide formula_107

By applying Bayes&#x27; theorem
formula_108,
and if we further assume the zero-or-one loss function, which is a same loss for all errors, the Bayes Decision rule can be reformulated as:
formula_109
where formula_110 is the prediction and formula_111 is the prior probability.

=== Relation to minimizing Kullback–Leibler divergence and cross entropy ===
Finding formula_112 that maximizes the likelihood is asymptotically equivalent to finding the formula_112 that defines a probability distribution (formula_114) that has a minimal distance, in terms of Kullback–Leibler divergence, to the real probability distribution from which our data were generated (i.e., generated by formula_115). In an ideal world, P and Q are the same (and the only thing unknown is formula_16 that defines P), but even if they are not and the model we use is misspecified, still the MLE will give us the &quot;closest&quot; distribution (within the restriction of a model Q that depends on formula_112) to the real distribution formula_115.

== Examples ==
=== Discrete uniform distribution ===

Consider a case where &quot;n&quot; tickets numbered from 1 to &quot;n&quot; are placed in a box and one is selected at random (&quot;see uniform distribution&quot;); thus, the sample size is 1. If &quot;n&quot; is unknown, then the maximum likelihood estimator formula_119 of &quot;n&quot; is the number &quot;m&quot; on the drawn ticket. (The likelihood is 0 for &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;m&quot;, for &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;m&quot;, and this is greatest when &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate of &quot;n&quot; occurs at the lower extreme of possible values {&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot; + 1, ...}, rather than somewhere in the &quot;middle&quot; of the range of possible values, which would result in less bias.) The expected value of the number &quot;m&quot; on the drawn ticket, and therefore the expected value of formula_119, is (&quot;n&quot; + 1)/2. As a result, with a sample size of 1, the maximum likelihood estimator for &quot;n&quot; will systematically underestimate &quot;n&quot; by (&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2.

=== Discrete distribution, finite parameter space ===
Suppose one wishes to determine just how biased an unfair coin is. Call the probability of tossing a &#x27;head&#x27; &quot;p&quot;. The goal then becomes to determine &quot;p&quot;.

Suppose the coin is tossed 80 times: i.e. the sample might be something like &quot;x&quot;1 = H, &quot;x&quot;2 = T, ..., &quot;x&quot;80 = T, and the count of the number of heads &quot;H&quot; is observed.

The probability of tossing tails is 1 − &quot;p&quot; (so here &quot;p&quot; is &quot;θ&quot; above). Suppose the outcome is 49 heads and 31 tails, and suppose the coin was taken from a box containing three coins: one which gives heads with probability &quot;p&quot; = , one which gives heads with probability &quot;p&quot; =  and another which gives heads with probability &quot;p&quot; = . The coins have lost their labels, so which one it was is unknown. Using maximum likelihood estimation, the coin that has the largest likelihood can be found, given the data that were observed. By using the probability mass function of the binomial distribution with sample size equal to 80, number successes equal to 49 but for different values of &quot;p&quot; (the &quot;probability of success&quot;), the likelihood function (defined below) takes one of three values:

formula_121

The likelihood is maximized when  = , and so this is the &quot;maximum likelihood estimate&quot; for .

=== Discrete distribution, continuous parameter space ===
Now suppose that there was only one coin but its could have been any value The likelihood function to be maximised is
formula_122

and the maximisation is over all possible values 

One way to maximize this function is by differentiating with respect to and setting to zero:

formula_123

This is a product of three terms. The first term is 0 when  = 0. The second is 0 when  = 1. The third is zero when  = . The solution that maximizes the likelihood is clearly  =  (since  = 0 and  = 1 result in a likelihood of 0). Thus the &quot;maximum likelihood estimator&quot; for is .

This result is easily generalized by substituting a letter such as in the place of 49 to represent the observed number of &#x27;successes&#x27; of our Bernoulli trials, and a letter such as in the place of 80 to represent the number of Bernoulli trials. Exactly the same calculation yields which is the maximum likelihood estimator for any sequence of Bernoulli trials resulting in &#x27;successes&#x27;.

=== Continuous distribution, continuous parameter space ===
For the normal distribution formula_124 which has probability density function

formula_125

the corresponding probability density function for a sample of independent identically distributed normal random variables (the likelihood) is

formula_126

This family of distributions has two parameters: ; so we maximize the likelihood, formula_127, over both parameters simultaneously, or if possible, individually.

Since the logarithm function itself is a continuous strictly increasing function over the range of the likelihood, the values which maximize the likelihood will also maximize its logarithm (the log-likelihood itself is not necessarily strictly increasing). The log-likelihood can be written as follows:

formula_128

(Note: the log-likelihood is closely related to information entropy and Fisher information.)

We now compute the derivatives of this log-likelihood as follows.

formula_129
where formula_130 is the sample mean. This is solved by

formula_131

This is indeed the maximum of the function, since it is the only turning point in and the second derivative is strictly less than zero. Its expected value is equal to the parameter of the given distribution,

formula_132

which means that the maximum likelihood estimator formula_133 is unbiased.

Similarly we differentiate the log-likelihood with respect to and equate to zero:

formula_134

which is solved by

formula_135

Inserting the estimate formula_136 we obtain

formula_137

To calculate its expected value, it is convenient to rewrite the expression in terms of zero-mean random variables (statistical error) formula_138. Expressing the estimate in these variables yields

formula_139

Simplifying the expression above, utilizing the facts that formula_140 and formula_141, allows us to obtain

formula_142

This means that the estimator formula_143 is biased for formula_144. It can also be shown that formula_145 is biased for formula_146, but that both formula_143 and formula_145 are consistent.

Formally we say that the &quot;maximum likelihood estimator&quot; for formula_149 is

formula_150

In this case the MLEs could be obtained individually. In general this may not be the case, and the MLEs would have to be obtained simultaneously.

The normal log-likelihood at its maximum takes a particularly simple form:

formula_151

This maximum log-likelihood can be shown to be the same for more general least squares, even for non-linear least squares. This is often used in determining likelihood-based approximate confidence intervals and confidence regions, which are generally more accurate than those using the asymptotic normality discussed above.

== Non-independent variables ==
It may be the case that variables are correlated, or more generally, not independent. Two random variables formula_152 and formula_153 are independent only if their joint probability density function is the product of the individual probability density functions, i.e.

formula_154

Suppose one constructs an order-&quot;n&quot; Gaussian vector out of random variables formula_155, where each variable has means given by formula_156. Furthermore, let the covariance matrix be denoted by formula_157. The joint probability density function of these &quot;n&quot; random variables then follows a multivariate normal distribution given by:

formula_158

In the bivariate case, the joint probability density function is given by:

formula_159

In this and other cases where a joint density function exists, the likelihood function is defined as above, in the section &quot;principles,&quot; using this density.

=== Example ===
formula_160 are counts in cells / boxes 1 up to m; each box has a different probability (think of the boxes being bigger or smaller) and we fix the number of balls that fall to be formula_161:formula_162. The probability of each box is formula_163, with a constraint: formula_164. This is a case in which the formula_165 &quot;s&quot; are not independent, the joint probability of a vector formula_166 is called the multinomial and has the form:

formula_167

Each box taken separately against all the other boxes is a binomial and this is an extension thereof.

The log-likelihood of this is:

formula_168

The constraint has to be taken into account and use the Lagrange multipliers:

formula_169

By posing all the derivatives to be 0, the most natural estimate is derived

formula_170

Maximizing log likelihood, with and without constraints, can be an unsolvable problem in closed form, then we have to use iterative procedures.

== Iterative procedures ==
Except for special cases, the likelihood equations
formula_171

cannot be solved explicitly for an estimator formula_172. Instead, they need to be solved iteratively: starting from an initial guess of formula_16 (say formula_174), one seeks to obtain a convergent sequence formula_175. Many methods for this kind of optimization problem are available, but the most commonly used ones are algorithms based on an updating formula of the form
formula_176

where the vector formula_177 indicates the descent direction of the rth &quot;step,&quot; and the scalar formula_178 captures the &quot;step length,&quot; also known as the learning rate.

=== Gradient descent method ===
(Note: here it is a maximization problem, so the sign before gradient is flipped)

formula_179 that is small enough for convergence and formula_180

Gradient descent method requires to calculate the gradient at the rth iteration, but no need to calculate the inverse of second-order derivative, i.e., the Hessian matrix. Therefore, it is computationally faster than Newton-Raphson method.

=== Newton–Raphson method ===
formula_181 and formula_182

where formula_183 is the score and formula_184 is the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function, both evaluated the rth iteration. But because the calculation of the Hessian matrix is computationally costly, numerous alternatives have been proposed. The popular Berndt–Hall–Hall–Hausman algorithm approximates the Hessian with the outer product of the expected gradient, such that

formula_185

=== Quasi-Newton methods ===
Other quasi-Newton methods use more elaborate secant updates to give approximation of Hessian matrix.

==== Davidon–Fletcher–Powell formula ====
DFP formula finds a solution that is symmetric, positive-definite and closest to the current approximate value of second-order derivative:
formula_186

where

formula_187
formula_188
formula_189

==== Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm ====
BFGS also gives a solution that is symmetric and positive-definite:

formula_190

where

formula_187
formula_189

BFGS method is not guaranteed to converge unless the function has a quadratic Taylor expansion near an optimum. However, BFGS can have acceptable performance even for non-smooth optimization instances

==== Fisher&#x27;s scoring ====
Another popular method is to replace the Hessian with the Fisher information matrix, formula_193, giving us the Fisher scoring algorithm. This procedure is standard in the estimation of many methods, such as generalized linear models.

Although popular, quasi-Newton methods may converge to a stationary point that is not necessarily a local or global maximum, but rather a local minimum or a saddle point. Therefore, it is important to assess the validity of the obtained solution to the likelihood equations, by verifying that the Hessian, evaluated at the solution, is both negative definite and well-conditioned.

== History ==

Early users of maximum likelihood include Carl Friedrich Gauss, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Thorvald N. Thiele, and Francis Ysidro Edgeworth. It was Ronald Fisher however, between 1912 and 1922, who singlehandedly created the modern version of the method.

Maximum-likelihood estimation finally transcended heuristic justification in a proof published by Samuel S. Wilks in 1938, now called Wilks&#x27; theorem. The theorem shows that the error in the logarithm of likelihood values for estimates from multiple independent observations is asymptotically &quot;χ&quot; 2-distributed, which enables convenient determination of a confidence region around any estimate of the parameters. The only difficult part of Wilks&#x27; proof depends on the expected value of the Fisher information matrix, which is provided by a theorem proven by Fisher. Wilks continued to improve on the generality of the theorem throughout his life, with his most general proof published in 1962.

Reviews of the development of maximum likelihood estimation have been provided by a number of authors.

<text>The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository, as designated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 1987, is a proposed deep geological repository storage facility within Yucca Mountain for spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste in the United States. The site is on federal land adjacent to the Nevada Test Site in Nye County, Nevada, about northwest of the Las Vegas Valley.

The project was approved in 2002 by the 107th United States Congress, but the 112th Congress ended federal funding for the site via amendment to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011, during the Obama administration. The project has encountered many difficulties and was highly contested by the public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians. The project also faces strong state and regional opposition. The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons.

This leaves the United States government (which disposes of its transuranic waste from nuclear weapons production below the surface at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico) and American nuclear power plants without any designated long-term storage for their high-level radioactive waste (spent fuel) stored on-site in steel and concrete casks (dry cask storage) at 76 reactor sites in 34 states.

Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reviewed options other than Yucca Mountain for a high-level waste repository. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America&#x27;s Nuclear Future, established by the Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It detailed an urgent need to find a site suitable for constructing a consolidated geological repository, stating that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with direct access to the Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as the Cabinet-level DOE is. But the site met with strong opposition in Nevada, including from then-Senate leader Harry Reid.

Under President Donald Trump, the DOE ceased deep borehole and other non-Yucca Mountain waste disposition research activities. For FY18, the DOE requested $120 million and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) $30 million from Congress to continue licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain Repository. For fiscal year 2019, the DOE again requested $120 million while the NRC increased its request to $47.7 million. Congress provided no funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. In May 2019, Representative John Shimkus reintroduced a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives for the site, but the Appropriation Committee killed an amendment by Representative Mike Simpson to add $74 million in Yucca Mountain funding to a DOE appropriations bill. On May 20, 2020, Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes testified in front of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that President Trump strongly opposes proceeding with the Yucca Mountain Repository.

In May 2021, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said that Yucca Mountain would not be part of the Biden administration&#x27;s plans for nuclear-waste disposal. She anticipated announcing the department&#x27;s next steps &quot;in the coming months&quot;.

== Introduction ==

Spent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and high-level radioactive waste is the by-product of reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, Congress established a national policy to solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates to 1957, when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best way to protect the environment and public health and safety is to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.

The DOE began studying Yucca Mountain in 1978 to determine whether it would be suitable for the nation&#x27;s first long-term geologic repository for over (150 million pounds) of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste as of 2015 stored at 121 sites around the nation. An estimated of the waste would be from U.S. military nuclear programs.

On December 19, 1984, the DOE selected ten locations in six states for consideration as potential repository sites, based on data collected for nearly ten years. The ten sites were studied and results of these preliminary studies were reported in 1985. Based on these reports, President Ronald Reagan approved three sites for intensive scientific study called site characterization. The three sites were Hanford, Washington; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain.

In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed DOE to study only Yucca Mountain, which is adjacent to the former nuclear test site. The Act provided that if during site characterization Yucca Mountain was found unsuitable, studies would stop immediately. This option expired when Reagan actually recommended the site. On July 23, 2002, President George W. Bush signed House Joint Resolution 87 (), allowing the DOE to take the next step in establishing a safe repository in which to store nuclear waste. The DOE was to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain Repository by January 31, 1998, but did not do so because of a series of delays due to legal challenges, concerns over how to transport nuclear waste to the facility, and political pressure resulting in underfunding of the construction.

On July 18, 2006, the DOE proposed March 31, 2017, as the date to open the facility and begin accepting waste based on full funding. On September 8, 2006, Bush nominated Ward (Edward) Sproat, a nuclear industry executive formerly of PECO energy in Pennsylvania, to lead the Yucca Mountain Project. Following the 2006 midterm congressional elections, Harry Reid, a longtime opponent of the repository, became the Senate Majority Leader, putting him in a position to greatly affect the future of the project. Reid said he would continue to work to block completion of the project, and is quoted as having said, &quot;Yucca Mountain is dead. It&#x27;ll never happen.&quot;

In the 2008 Omnibus Spending Bill, the Yucca Mountain Project&#x27;s budget was reduced to $390 million. The project was able to reallocate resources and delay transportation expenditures to complete the License Application for submission on June 3, 2008. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama promised to abandon the project. After his election, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Obama he did not have the ability to do so. On April 23, 2009, Lindsey Graham and eight other U.S. senators introduced legislation to provide &quot;rebates&quot; from a $30 billion federally managed fund into which nuclear power plants had been paying, so as to refund all collected funds if Congress canceled the project.

In November 2013, in response to a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute, the U.S. court of appeals ruled that nuclear utilities may stop paying into the nuclear waste recovery fund until either the DOE follows the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which designates Yucca Mountain as the repository, or Congress changes the law. The fee ended May 16, 2014.

Lacking an operating repository, the federal government initially paid utility companies somewhere between $300 and $500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998. For the ten years after 2015, it is estimated to cost taxpayers $24 billion in payments from the Judgment Fund. The Judgment Fund is not subject to budget rules and allows Congress to ignore the nuclear waste issue since payments therefrom do not have any impact on yearly spending for other programs.

== Facility ==
The purpose of the Yucca Mountain project is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and develop a national site for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste storage. The management and operating contractor as of April 1, 2009 for the project is USA Repository Services (USA-RS), a wholly owned subsidiary of URS Corporation (now part of AECOM) with supporting principal subcontractors Shaw Corporation (now part of McDermott International Inc.) and Areva Federal Services LLC (now Orano federal services business).

After the layoff of 800 employees on March 31, 2009, about 100 employees remained on the project until all technical staff were laid off by the end of fiscal year 2010 due to zero funding in the 2011 budget for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. Sandia National Laboratories was responsible for post-closure analysis and ensuring compliance with the NWPA. The main tunnel of the Exploratory Studies Facility is U-shaped, long and wide.

There are also several cathedral-like alcoves that branch from the main tunnel. Most of the scientific experiments were conducted in these alcoves. The emplacement drifts (smaller-diameter tunnels branching off the main tunnel) where waste would have been stored were not constructed since they required authorization from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The repository has a statutory limit of .

To store that much waste would have required of tunnels. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act further limits the capacity of the repository to of initial heavy metal in commercial spent fuel. The 104 U.S. commercial reactors then operating were expected to produce this quantity of spent fuel by 2014, assuming that the spent fuel rods are not reprocessed. Currently, the US has no civil reprocessing plant.

By 2008, Yucca Mountain was one of the most studied pieces of geology in the world; between geologic studies and materials science, the United States had invested $9 billion in the project. This site studied by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) differs substantially from other potential repositories because of its natural analogues of nuclear material, which are being studied. The DOE estimates that it has over 100 million gallons of highly radioactive waste and of spent fuel from the production of nuclear weapons and from research activities in temporary storage.

The facility&#x27;s cost is being paid for by a combination of a tax on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power and by taxpayers for disposal of weapons and naval nuclear waste. Based on the 2001 cost estimate, about 73% is funded by consumers of nuclear-powered electricity and 27% by taxpayers.

The Total System Life Cycle Cost Director Sproat presented to Congress on July 15, 2008, was $90 billion. This cost could not be compared to previous estimates since it included a repository capacity about twice as large as previously estimated over a much longer period of time (100 years vs. 30 years). Additionally, the cost of the project continued to escalate because of insufficient funding to most efficiently move forward and complete the project. By 2007, the DOE announced it was seeking to double the size of the Yucca Mountain repository to a capacity of , or 300 million pounds.

The tunnel boring machine (TBM) that excavated the main tunnel cost $13 million and was long when in operation. It now sits at its exit point at the South Portal (south entrance) of the facility. The short side tunnel alcoves were excavated using explosives.

== Opposition ==
The DOE was scheduled to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain repository by . By 2010, years after this deadline, the future status of the repository at Yucca Mountain was still unknown due to ongoing litigation, and opposition by Senator Reid.

Because of construction delays, a number of nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to dry cask storage of waste on-site indefinitely in steel and concrete casks.

The project is widely opposed in Nevada and is a hotly debated national topic. A two-thirds majority of Nevadans believe it is unfair for their state to have to store nuclear waste when there are no nuclear power plants in Nevada. Many Nevadans&#x27; opposition stemmed from the so-called &quot;Screw Nevada Bill,&quot; the 1987 legislation halting study of Hanford and Texas as potential sites for the waste before conclusions could be made. The county containing the proposed facility, Nye County, supports the repository&#x27;s development, as do six adjoining counties. A 2015 survey of Nevadans found 55% agreeing that the state should be open to discussion of what benefits could be received.

One point of concern has been the standard of radiation emission in 10,000 to 1,000,000 years. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a limit of 350 millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued a draft of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement showing that for the first 10,000 years, mean public dose would be 0.24 mrem/year and that thereafter the median public dose would be 0.98 mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip X-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual&#x27;s dose from background radiation is about 350 mrem, though some places get more than twice that.

On February 12, 2002, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham deemed this site suitable as the nation&#x27;s nuclear repository. The governor of Nevada had 90 days to object and did so, but Congress overrode the objection. If the governor&#x27;s objection had stood, the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen. In August 2004, the repository became an election issue when U.S. Senator John Kerry said he would abandon the plans if elected.

In March 2005, the U.S. Energy and Interior departments revealed that several U.S. Geological Survey hydrologists had exchanged emails discussing possible falsification of quality assurance documents on water infiltration research. On February 17, 2006, the DOE&#x27;s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) released a report confirming the technical soundness of infiltration modeling work performed by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) employees. In March 2006, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Majority Staff issued a 25-page white paper, &quot;Yucca Mountain: The Most Studied Real Estate on the Planet.&quot; The conclusions were:

* Extensive studies consistently show Yucca Mountain to be a sound site for nuclear waste disposal
* The cost of not moving forward is extremely high
* Nuclear waste disposal capability is an environmental imperative
* Nuclear waste disposal capability supports national security
* Demand for new nuclear plants also demands disposal capability

On January 18, 2006, DOE OCRWM announced that it would designate Sandia National Laboratories as its lead laboratory to integrate repository science work for the Yucca Mountain Project. &quot;We believe that establishing Sandia as our lead laboratory is an important step in our new path forward. The independent, expert review that the scientists at Sandia will perform will help ensure that the technical and scientific basis for the Yucca Mountain repository is without question,&quot; OCRWM&#x27;s Acting Director Paul Golan said. &quot;Sandia has unique experience in managing scientific investigations in support of a federally licensed geologic disposal facility, having served in that role as the scientific advisor to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico.&quot; Sandia began acting as the lead laboratory on October 1, 2006.

Because of questions raised by the State of Nevada and congressional members about the quality of the science behind the Yucca Mountain Project, the DOE announced on March 31, 2006, the selection of Oak Ridge Associated Universities/Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (a not-for-profit consortium that includes 96 doctoral degree-granting institutions and 11 associate member universities) to provide expert reviews of scientific and technical work on the Yucca Mountain Project. DOE stated that the project &quot;will be based on sound science. By bringing in Oak Ridge for review of technical work, DOE will seek to present a high level of expertise and credibility as they move the project forward ... This award gives DOE access to academic and research institutions to help DOE meet their mission and legal obligation to license, construct, and open Yucca Mountain as the nation&#x27;s repository for spent nuclear fuel.&quot;

There was significant public and political opposition to the project in Nevada. An attempt was made to push ahead with it and override the opposition. But for large projects that would take decades to complete, there is every chance that sustained local opposition will prevail, and this happened with the Yucca Mountain project. Successful nuclear waste storage siting efforts in Scandinavia have involved local communities in the decision-making process and given them a veto at each stage, but this did not happen with Yucca Mountain. Local communities at potential storage and repository sites &quot;should have early and continued involvement in the process, including funding that would allow them to retain technical experts&quot;.

On March 5, 2009, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu reiterated in a Senate hearing that the Yucca Mountain site was no longer considered an option for storing reactor waste.

On March 3, 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its license application, but multiple lawsuits to stop this action have been filed by states, counties, and individuals across the country as being unauthorized by the NWPA.

The costly nuclear accident in 2014 at the New Mexico Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in which a nuclear waste container exploded has caused doubt that it could serve as an alternative for Yucca Mountain.

In January 2019, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak vowed that &quot;not one ounce&quot; of nuclear waste would be allowed at Yucca Mountain, and a May funding bill did not include funding for the site. In May 2019, the Reno Gazette-Journal published a long-form essay cataloging opposition to the Yucca Mountain project. According to a tribal elder, the Western Shoshone view Yucca Mountain as sacred and believe a nuclear storage facility &quot;will poison everything. It&#x27;s people&#x27;s life, our Mother Earth&#x27;s life, all the living things here, all the creatures; whatever&#x27;s crawling around, it&#x27;s their life too.&quot; The tribes say they lack funds to discredit federal safety claims, but will be directly affected by a potential disaster.

== Radiation standards ==
=== Original standard ===
The EPA established its Yucca Mountain standards in June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem per year for the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards set a limit of 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public.

The groundwater protection standard is consistent with the EPA Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE&#x27;s Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard.

The 10,000-year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA&#x27;s generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.

=== Inconsistent standards ===
Shortly after the EPA first established these standards in 2001, the nuclear industry, several environmental and public interest groups, and the State of Nevada challenged the standards in court. In July 2004, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found in favor of the EPA on all counts except one: the 10,000 year regulatory time frame. The court ruled that EPA&#x27;s 10,000-year compliance period for isolation of radioactive waste was not consistent with National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommendations and was too short.

The NAS report had recommended standards be set for the time of peak risk, which might approach a period of one million years. By limiting the compliance time to 10,000 years, EPA did not respect a statutory requirement that it develop standards consistent with NAS recommendations.

=== EPA&#x27;s rule ===
The EPA published in the U.S. Federal Register a final rule in 2009. The rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, the EPA has two dose standards that would apply based on the number of years from the time the facility is closed.

For the first 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule&#x27;s dose limit of 15 millirem per year. This is protection at the level of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100 millirem per year. EPA&#x27;s rule requires DOE to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1 mrem/year public dose for 1,000,000 years.

== Geology ==

The formation that makes up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surrounding the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation. It lies along the transition between the Mojave and the Great Basin Deserts.

The volcanic tuff at Yucca Mountain is appreciably fractured and movement of water through an aquifer below the waste repository is primarily through fractures. While the fractures are usually confined to individual layers of tuff, the faults extend from the planned storage area all the way to the water table below the surface. Future water transport from the surface to waste containers is likely to be dominated by fractures. There is evidence that surface water has been transported down through the of overburden to the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain in less than 50 years.

The aquifer of Yucca Mountain drains to Amargosa Valley, home to over 1400 people and a number of endangered species.

Some site opponents assert that, after the predicted containment failure of the waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will be stored in such a way as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.

The area around Yucca Mountain received much more rain in the geologic past and the water table was consequently much higher than it is today, though well below the level of the repository.

===Earthquakes===
The DOE has stated that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not significantly affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.

In September 2007, it was discovered that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility, hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located, beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels. The discovery required several structures to be moved several hundred feet further to the east, and drew criticism from Robert R. Loux, then head of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, who argues that Yucca administrators should have known about the fault line&#x27;s location years prior, and called the movement of the structures &quot;just-in-time engineering.&quot;

In June 2008, a major nuclear equipment supplier, Holtec International, criticized the DOE&#x27;s safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste before they are buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain Project. The concern is that, in an earthquake, the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a &quot;chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts&quot;.

== Transportation of waste ==
The nuclear waste was planned to be shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust containers known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks, approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons. State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel entered their jurisdictions.

=== Nevada routes ===
Within Nevada, the planned primary mode of transportation was via rail through the Caliente Corridor. This corridor starts in Caliente, Nevada, traveling along the northern and western borders of the Nevada Test Site for approximately . It then turns south.

Other options that were being considered included a rail route along the Mina corridor. This rail route would have originated at the Fort Churchill Siding rail line, near Wabuska. The proposed corridor would have proceeded southeast through Hawthorne, Blair Junction, Lida Junction and Oasis Valley. At Oasis Valley, the rail line would have turned north-northeast towards Yucca Mountain. Use of this rail corridor by the DOE would have required permission from the Walker River Paiute Tribe in order to cross their land. As the first of the proposed corridor was owned by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), additional permission from the DoD would have to be granted.

The Nevada Center for Biological Diversity and the Nevada Attorney General have expressed concern about the transportation routes, &quot;through any number of sensitive habitats.&quot;

=== Impacts ===
Since the early 1960s, the U.S. has safely conducted more than 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel without any harmful release of radioactive material. This safety record is comparable to the worldwide experience where more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 – an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would have been shipped to Yucca Mountain.

But cities were still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may have passed through heavily populated areas. Dr. Robert Halstead, a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988, said of transportation of the high-level waste, &quot;They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, in the Chicago metropolitan area, in Omaha.&quot; &quot;Coming out of the south, the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta, in Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City, moving across through Salt Lake City, through downtown Las Vegas, up to Yucca Mountain. And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well.&quot; Spencer Abraham (DOE) said, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country, an understanding that the federal government knows how to do it safely.&quot;

In October 2018, a state senator from Utah argued that transferring nuclear waste from other states to Yucca Mountain on state highways and railways could be a health hazard.

== Cultural impact ==
Archaeological surveys have found evidence that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.

Yucca Mountain and surrounding lands were central in the lives of the Southern Paiute, Western Shoshone, and Owens Valley Paiute and Shoshone peoples, who shared them for religious ceremonies, resource uses, and social events.

==Delays since 2009==
Starting in 2009, the Obama administration attempted to close the Yucca Mountain repository, despite US law that designates Yucca Mountain as the nation&#x27;s nuclear waste repository. The administration agency, DOE, began implementation of the President&#x27;s plan in May 2009. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also went along with the administration&#x27;s closure plan. Various state and congressional entities attempted to challenge the administration&#x27;s closure plans, by statute and in court.

In August 2013, a US Court of Appeals decision told the NRC and the Obama administration that they must either &quot;approve or reject [DOE&#x27;s] application for [the] never-completed waste storage site at Nevada&#x27;s Yucca Mountain.&quot; They cannot simply make plans for its closure in violation of US law.

In May 2009, then United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu stated:

In 2008, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works found that failure to perform to contractual requirements could cost taxpayers up to $11 billion by 2020. In 2013, this estimate of taxpayer liability was raised to $21 billion. In July 2009, the House of Representatives voted 388 to 30 on amendments to HHR3183 () to not defund the Yucca Mountain repository in the FY2010 budget. In 2013, the House of Representatives voted twice during the 2014 Energy and Water Appropriations debate by over 80% majority to reject elimination of Yucca Mountain as the nation&#x27;s only nuclear waste solution.

On April 13, 2010, the state of Washington filed suit to prevent the closing of Yucca Mountain, since this would slow efforts to clean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. South Carolina, Aiken County (the location of the Savannah River site) and others joined Washington state in the suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011, saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on the withdrawal of the license application. Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29.

With $32 billion received from power companies to fund the project, and $12 billion spent to study and build it, the federal government had $27 billion left, including interest. In March 2012, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bill requiring three-fourths of that money to be given back to customers, and the remainder to the companies for storage improvements.

In August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to either &quot;approve or reject [DOE&#x27;s] application for [the] never-completed waste storage site at Yucca Mountain.&quot; The court opinion said that the NRC was &quot;simply flouting the law&quot; in its previous action to allow the Obama administration to continue plans to close the proposed waste site since a federal law designating Yucca Mountain as the nation&#x27;s nuclear waste repository remains in effect. The court opinion stated that &quot;The president may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections.&quot;

In response, the NRC issued the final volumes of the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report (SER), which included the NRC staff&#x27;s statement that the site would meet all applicable standards. At the same time, the staff also stated that the NRC should not authorize construction of the repository until the requirements for land and water rights were met and a supplement to DOE&#x27;s environmental impact statement (EIS) was finished. On March 3, 2015, the NRC ordered the staff to complete the supplemental EIS and make the Yucca Mountain licensing document database publicly available, using all the remaining previously appropriated licensing funds.

In March 2015, Senator Lamar Alexander introduced the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S854) in the U.S. Senate. It was intended to establish a fully independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) that would develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Construction of such facilities would require the consent of the state, local, and tribal governments that may be affected. The NWA would be required to complete a mission plan to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from non-operating reactors and other &quot;emergency&quot; deliveries (called &quot;priority waste&quot;).

The goal would be to have a storage facility for waste from operating reactors or other &quot;non-priority waste&quot; available by 2025, and an actual permanent repository by the end of 2048. The current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the nation&#x27;s initial permanent repository would be repealed. Any nuclear waste fees collected after S.854 was enacted would be held in a newly established Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be allowed to draw from that fund any amounts needed to carry out S.854, unless limited by annual appropriations or authorizations. S.854 died in committee.

As of September 30, 2021, the Nuclear Waste Fund had an investment fair value of $52.4 billion.

=== Related legislation (2017–2019) ===
On March 15, 2017, the Trump administration announced it would request congressional approval for $120 million to restart licensing activity at the Yucca Mountain repository, with funding also to be used to create an interim storage program. The project would consolidate nuclear waste across the United States in Yucca Mountain, which had been stockpiled in local locations since 2010. The federal budget proposal was refused by the U.S. Senate. Although his administration had allocated money to the project, in October 2018, President Donald Trump stated he opposed the use of Yucca mountain for dumping, saying he agreed &quot;with the people of Nevada.&quot;

On May 11, 2018, the bill H.R. 3053 was approved in a 340–72 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill directed the DOE to resume the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, with licensing for a permanent site at the mountain to &quot;take up to five years.&quot; The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act was sponsored by John Shimkus. &quot;The Hill&quot; clarified that the bill would &quot;set a path forward for the DOE to resume the process of planning for and building the southern Nevada site, transfer land to the DOE for it, ease the federal funding mechanism and allow DOE to build or license a temporary site to store waste while the Yucca project is being planned and built.&quot;

The bill would &quot;direct [the DOE] to revive the licensing process for Yucca Mountain to be designated as the country’s permanent site for nuclear waste.&quot; The bill would bring together waste from 121 locations in 39 states. All Nevada representatives opposed the bill. The measure was scheduled to go to the U.S. Senate next, and if passed there, would require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to decide on the matter within 30 months.

&quot;The Hill&quot; noted that the bill received widespread support from lawmakers arguing that nuclear waste was best transferred out of their districts to Yucca Mountain, a concept opposed by Nevada representatives, with politicians such as Dina Titus dubbing it the &quot;Screw Nevada 2.0&quot; bill. Titus proposed an amendment that would have required long-term storage to be kept in locales that consented, which the U.S. House of Representatives rejected, 332–80. In their opposition to the use of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear repository, Nevada representatives were supported by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and other politicians.

In June 2018, the Trump administration and some members of Congress again began proposing using Yucca Mountain, with Nevada Senators raising opposition. By early 2019, use of Yucca Mountain was in &quot;political limbo&quot; as opposition to the site led to an impasse. In January 2019, a panel of scientists introduced to Congress a 126-page report, &quot;Reset of America’s Nuclear Waste Management&quot;, which proposed including Yucca Mountain as a potential repository with &quot;development of a consensus-based siting process, but one that would still include Yucca Mountain as a candidate.&quot;

Nevada National Security Site officials in April 2019 assured the public that the Device Assembly Facility on the Nevada security site was safe from earthquake threats. In contrast, Nevada officials claimed seismic activity in the region made it unsafe for the storage of nuclear waste. On April 1, 2019, the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; noted that &quot;Nevada Democrats in the House&quot; were seeking to block transfers of plutonium from the DOE into the state by the use of the appropriations process.

<text>The national flag of Estonia () is a tricolour featuring three equal horizontal bands of blue at the top, black in the centre, and white at the bottom. The flag is called () in Estonian.

The tricolour was already in wide use as the symbol of the nation, when the Republic of Estonia became a fully independent country in 1918. Formally, the tricolour became the national flag by the decision of the Estonian government on 21 November 1918, and the parliament later reconfirmed the flag&#x27;s official status with a law in 1922.

The tricolour was publicly used as the national flag until the first year of World War II, when the Soviet army invaded and occupied Estonia in June 1940. Following the annexation of Estonia by the USSR in August 1940, the new Stalinist regime banned the Estonian flag, and its use as well as any use of its blue, black and white colour combination became punishable by laws of the Soviet Union. The national flag was from 1940 until 1991 continuously used by the Estonian government-in-exile, diplomatic service, and the diaspora of Estonian refugees around the world. In October 1988, the public use of the tricolour flag was officially permitted again by the local authorities. On 23 February 1989, the Soviet red flag was taken down permanently from the Pikk Hermann tower of the Toompea Castle in the capital city Tallinn. It was replaced with the blue-black-white flag on the next morning, 24 February, upon the 70th anniversary of the Estonian Declaration of Independence (1918). The national flag was officially re-adopted by the Estonian authorities 7 August 1990, one year before the nation&#x27;s full restoration of independence.

== Official versions of the flag ==
== History ==
In the 1820s, in the University of Tartu (Dorpat), three eponymous German-speaking student corporations (corps) were established for each of the three Baltic provinces (Estonia, Livonia and Curonia). Each of them selected their own &quot;colours&quot; which, in turn, over time, became flags and informal visual representations of the corresponding province. Public display (for example, as part of attire) of these colour combinations was prohibited by the Imperial Russian authorities in 1821–1862, in 1887–1904 and, after the outbreak of World War I, finally and completely banned during the anti-German propaganda campaign in 1915.

In 1870, the predecessor of the Estonian Students&#x27; Society, the first Estonian-speaking student organisation, was established at the University of Tartu, and in 1881 it adopted a similar set of three &quot;colours&quot;: blue, black, and white. Unlike the earlier corps&#x27; colour combinations, each one of the three colours of the new organisation was ascribed symbolic meanings. The first such tricolour flag was made in the spring of 1884 and consecrated at Otepää on June 4 at the same year.
The blue-black-white flag of the Estonian university student organisation was later on gradually associated with Estonian nationalism and, by the beginning of the 20th century, it had already become the de facto flag of the Estonian-speaking people. It was known as &quot;the nation&#x27;s flag&quot; (&quot;rahvuslipp&quot;) when the Estonian Declaration of Independence was issued on 23–24 February 1918. Formally, the tricolour became the national flag of the newly independent country by the decision of the Estonian Provisional Government on 21 November 1918. On 12 December 1918, the flag was for the first time raised on top of the Pikk Hermann tower, and that location has since then become its most symbolic site of display. The flag&#x27;s official status was reconfirmed by a law passed by the Estonian parliament on 16 July 1922.

The invasion of Estonia by the Soviet Army on 16–17 June 1940 was followed by the banning of the flag by the occupation authorities. It was taken down from the most symbolic location, the tower of Pikk Hermann in Tallinn, on 21 June 1940, when Estonia was still formally independent. On the next day, 22 June, it was hoisted along with the red flag. The tricolour disappeared completely from the tower on 27 July 1940, and was replaced by the red flag of the Soviet Union.

During the German occupation from 1941 until 1944, the tricolour flag was accepted as the flag of the Estonian people but not as the country&#x27;s national flag. After the German retreat from Tallinn in September 1944, the Estonian tricolour was hoisted once again.

When the Soviet Red Army reconquered Tallinn on 22 September 1944, the blue-black-white flag disappeared from the Pikk Hermann tower. Its place was subsequently taken by the Soviet red flags until 1989. Any display or distribution of the blue-black-white flag remained a punishable crime by the Soviet laws which were enforced until the late 1980s. 21 October 1987 was the first time when Soviet forces did not take down the flag at a public event. Starting from 24 February 1989 the blue-black-white flag has been flown again from the Pikk Hermann tower in Tallinn. It was formally redeclared as the national flag on 7 August 1990, a little over a year before Estonia restored full independence.

== Specifications ==

The colour shades are defined by Parliament and Government Office as follows:
=== Selections from the Estonian Flag Act ===
The most recent Estonian Flag Act was passed 23 March 2005 and came into force on 1 January 2006. It has been amended several times since then. The Act specifies the colours in Pantone and CMYK formats, as well as specifying when it can be hoisted and how it can be used and by whom. The minimum size of the flag to be hoisted on a wall-mounted flagstaff or on a flagpole on the roof of a building is . The Act specifies that the &quot;Estonian flag is used as the ethnic and the national flag&quot;.

More specifically, the Flag Act specifies that the flag be hoisted on the Pikk Hermann tower in Tallinn every day at sunrise, but not earlier than 7:00 a.m., and is lowered at sunset. The flag flying days are:

* 3 January: Commemoration Day of Combatants of the Estonian War of Independence
* 2 February: Anniversary of Tartu Peace Treaty
* 24 February: Independence Day
* 14 March: Mother Tongue Day
* 23 April: Veterans&#x27; Day

== Symbolism ==
There is a popular song dedicated specifically to the flag of Estonia: &quot;The Estonian Flag&quot; (). The author of its lyrics, Martin Lipp, had an eponymous last name, and his poem was set to music in 1922 by composer Enn Võrk. A symbolic interpretation made popular by the poetry of Martin Lipp has it that the blue stands for the blue sky above Estonians, the black for the attachment to the soil of their homeland, and the white for purity, hard work and commitment.

== Various historical flags ==
== Nordic flag proposals ==
Several Nordic cross designs were proposed already in 1919, prior to the official adoption of the Estonian state flag. In 2001, journalist Kaarel Tarand made a similar suggestion again – that the flag design be changed from a tricolour to a Nordic cross with the same three colours. Supporters of this idea have claimed that the cross, instead of a tricolour design, would better symbolise Estonia&#x27;s links with Nordic countries. However, as the traditional tricolour bands have by now become an important symbol of national identity, proposals to modify the national flag have not gained much popularity.

Advocates for a Nordic flag have stated that Estonians consider themselves a Nordic nation rather than Baltic, based on their cultural and historical ties with Sweden, Denmark, and particularly Finland.

<doc id="140817" wikidata="Q5535255" url="?curid=140817" title="Geography of Württemberg">
<text>Württemberg, a hilly rather than a mountainous region, forms part of the South German tableland, also referred to as the Swiss plateau. The undulating fertile terraces of Upper and Lower Swabia typify this agricultural region. Estimates of land form proportions count a quarter of the entire area as plain, less than one-third as mountainous, and nearly one-half as hill-country.

*Average elevation above sea level: 
*Lowest point: Bottingen , where the Neckar leaves Württemberg
*Highest point: the Katzenkopf , on the Hornisgrinde, on the western border

==Orography==

The chief mountains include the Black Forest on the west, the Swabian Alb or Rauhe Alb stretching across the middle of the area from south-west to north-east, and the Adelegg mountains in the extreme south-east, adjoining the Allgäu Alps in Bavaria. The Rauhe Alb (or Alp) slopes gradually down into the plateau on its southern side, but on the north it appears sometimes rugged and steep, its line broken by isolated projecting hills. The highest summits, the Lemberg , the Ober-Hohenberg and the Plettenberg , lie in the southwest.

To the south of the Swabian Alb the plateau of Upper Swabia stretches to Lake Constance and eastwards across the Iller into Bavaria. Between the Alb and the Black Forest in the north-west lie the fertile terraces of Lower Swabia, which continue north-eastwards into Franconia.

==Hydrography==

About 70% of Württemberg belongs to the basin of the Rhine, and about 30% to that of the Danube. The main river, the Neckar, flows northward for through the area to join the Rhine, draining with its tributaries (notably the rivers Rems, Kocher and Jagst) 57% of the former state of Württemberg. The Danube flows from east to west across southern Württemberg, a distance of , a small section of which crosses through former Hohenzollern territory. Just above Ulm the river Iller, which forms the boundary between Bavaria and Württemberg for about , joins the Danube. The Tauber in the north-east joins the Main; the Argen and Schussen in the south flow into Lake Constance.

The lakes of Württemberg, except those in the Black Forest, all lie south of the Danube. The largest is the Federsee (2.6 km2), near Bad Buchau. About one-fifth of Lake Constance forms Württemberg territory.

Mineral springs abound; most famously at the spa of Wildbad, in the Black Forest.

<doc id="140821" wikidata="Q885249" url="?curid=140821" title="Bloodwych">
<text>Bloodwych is a dungeon role-playing video game, a dungeon crawler, developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. The box artwork is Chris Achilleos. The player is a champion of Trazere who, after recruiting up to three fellow champions, travels through dungeons and mazes fighting creatures along the way to find and destroy the evil Zendick, and banish the Lord of Entropy.

==Development==
The development of &quot;Bloodwych&quot; has been well documented by Richard Hewison, who was the project manager for the game at the time at Mirrorsoft, in his article titled &quot;The Trazere Trinity&quot;.

&quot;Bloodwych&quot; began development on the Commodore 64, during Anthony Taglione&#x27;s time at university in reading, where he had gained a keen interest in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and where friend (and eventual &quot;Bloodwych&quot; artist and designer) Pete James drew initial screens for a first person &#x27;chess-like&#x27; game.

After further inspiration from playing FTL&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, Tag, Pete and Philip Taglione suggested a C64 version of the game to Mirrorsoft, but without rights being obtained this developed into a two-player split screen game titled &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; which would eventually be renamed to &quot;Bloodwych&quot; after the launch of the Channel 4 television programme of the same name.

The development screens were demonstrated to Mirrorsoft, who agreed to fund the game on the basis of lead versions being pushed to the 16-bit platforms the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga. Tag took the lead on these 68000 machines, whilst his brother Philip developed the z80 8-bit versions for the Amstrad and ZX Spectrum, and the C64 version followed with help from Tag.

Renowned fantasy artist Chris Achilleos was approached to create the box artwork; his painting of a &quot;crystal guardian&quot; for &quot;Bloodwych&quot; was done with complete creative freedom, and having finished the painting, the creature that Achilleos created was then incorporated into the game itself as The Lord of Entropy (later referred to in documentation as &#x27;The Entity&#x27;) located in the final level of Zendik&#x27;s tower.

The IBM PC conversion was created away from the original team by Walking Circles, and included in-game music by David Whittaker, but also included a number of bugs, rendering the game unable to be completed.

==Gameplay==

All of the champions fall into the four classes of Warrior, Mage, Adventurer or Thief (referred to as &#x27;cutpurse&#x27; in game), each with their own particular capability. Within each class there are four characters available, each with their own colour of Red, Blue, Green or Yellow representing a magical alignment. These colours act as a consistent theme during the game, to the characters they have their own particular advantage, largely with respect to the families of spells the character will be most adept at casting and developing. The green spells are determined for the &#x27;Serpent&#x27; (representing the physical), the blue spells are determined for the &#x27;Moon&#x27; (representing mind and illusion), the red spells for the &#x27;Dragon&#x27; (for fire and energy) and the yellow spells for &#x27;Chaos&#x27; (affecting magic itself and entropy).

The four of the Towers navigated by the characters, and the Crystals which are required to be collected from each are also within this theme, and the colours are also important when it comes to matching up coloured wands later in the game to magnify the effects of spell-casting. Other objects such as rings (which allow &#x27;free&#x27; spell casting) and certain weapons also align with these colours. 

One particularly memorable quirk of the game is the ability granted to players to hold simple conversations with traders, other champions, and even enemies during combat. Stock pseudo-medieval phrases such as &quot;Truly my courage is remarkable&quot; and &quot;Begone, thou oaf&quot; are selected using a menu, and can be used in combination to flatter a desired companion, aggravate an enemy, or lower the price of an item which the player wishes to purchase. Many players have found that the price of a long sword (RRP 10 gold pieces) can fall to as little as 6 or 7 after the shopkeeper has been flattered with phrases such as &quot;Thou seems fine&quot;, particularly when this strategy is used in conjunction with the Beguile spell (a blue/moon spell, most effectively cast by Megrim).

==Demonstration Level==
A modified map for the first level of the game was produced as a demonstration level, and featured on the coverdisk of issue 1 of the &quot;ST Format&quot; magazine.

==Expansion==
The game had an add-on pack released called &quot;Bloodwych: Data Disks Vol 1&quot; for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga (also known as &quot;Bloodwych: The Extended Levels&quot;). Among the features of the add-on pack was the capability to persuade some of the enemy creatures to join player&#x27;s &quot;merry band&quot;. The expansion required players to import a saved game from the original &quot;Bloodwych&quot;. &quot;The Data Disk&quot; also featured stronger opponents than before, the recommended experience level for the imported adventurers was level 14. If the imported characters&#x27; experience were below that level, their experience progress would be temporarily accelerated. The release also included a free &#x27;hints &amp; tips&#x27; booklet for the original dungeons to help players get their teams to the end of the original game prior to import.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; criticized the IBM version&#x27;s &quot;weak graphics&quot;, but concluded that &quot;&quot;Bloodwych&quot; scores very solidly on game-play and deserves serious consideration from dungeon fanatics&quot;. &quot;CU Amiga-64&quot; gave the game additionally a CU Screen Star, stating that the game had even more varied gameplay than &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;. It also praised that the puzzles could be solved by pure logic.

==&quot;Hexx: Heresy of the Wizard&quot;==
&quot;Bloodwych&quot; was followed in 1994 by Psygnosis&#x27; &quot;Hexx: Heresy of the Wizard&quot; (working title &quot;Wizard&quot;). &quot;Hexx&quot; was a similar dungeon-navigating game with updated graphics, a slightly modified cast of champions, and a greatly expanded magic system, but no longer featured the grid-based walking system of typical blobbers.

<text>Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962) was a British polymath who was active as a mathematician, statistician, biologist, geneticist, and academic. For his work in statistics, he has been described as &quot;a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science&quot; and &quot;the single most important figure in 20th century statistics&quot;. In genetics, Fisher was the one to most comprehensively combine the ideas of Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin, as his work used mathematics to combine Mendelian genetics and natural selection; this contributed to the revival of Darwinism in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis. For his contributions to biology, Richard Dawkins declared Fisher to be the greatest of Darwin&#x27;s successors. He is also considered one of the founding fathers of Neo-Darwinism. According to statistician Jeffrey T. Leek, Fisher is the most influential scientist of all time based on the number of citations of his contributions.

From 1919, he worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station for 14 years; there, he analyzed its immense body of data from crop experiments since the 1840s, and developed the analysis of variance (ANOVA). He established his reputation there in the following years as a biostatistician. Fisher also made fundamental contributions to multivariate statistics.

Fisher founded quantitative genetics, and together with J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics. Fisher outlined Fisher&#x27;s principle, the Fisherian runaway, the sexy son hypothesis theories of sexual selection, parental investment, and also pioneered linkage analysis and gene mapping. On the other hand, as the founder of modern statistics, Fisher made countless contributions, including creating the modern method of maximum likelihood and deriving the properties of maximum likelihood estimators, fiducial inference, the derivation of various sampling distributions, founding the principles of the design of experiments, and much more. Fisher&#x27;s famous 1921 paper alone has been described as &quot;arguably the most influential article&quot; on mathematical statistics in the twentieth century, and equivalent to &quot;Darwin on evolutionary biology, Gauss on number theory, Kolmogorov on probability, and Adam Smith on economics&quot;, and is credited with completely revolutionizing statistics. Due to his influence and numerous fundamental contributions, he has been described as &quot;the most original evolutionary biologist of the twentieth century&quot; and as &quot;the greatest statistician of all time&quot;. His work is further credited with later initiating the Human Genome Project. Fisher also contributed to the understanding of human blood groups.

Fisher has also been praised as a pioneer of the Information Age. His work on a mathematical theory of information ran parallel to the work of Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener, though based on statistical theory. A concept to have come out of his work is that of Fisher information. He also had ideas about social sciences, which have been described as a &quot;foundation for evolutionary social sciences&quot;.

Fisher held strong views on race and eugenics, insisting on racial differences. Although he was clearly a eugenicist, there is some debate as to whether Fisher supported scientific racism (see ). He was the Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London and editor of the &quot;Annals of Eugenics&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Fisher was born in East Finchley in London, England, into a middle-class household; his father, George, was a successful partner in Robinson &amp; Fisher, auctioneers and fine art dealers. He was one of twins, with the other twin being still-born and grew up the youngest, with three sisters and one brother. From 1896 until 1904 they lived at Inverforth House in London, where English Heritage installed a blue plaque in 2002, before moving to Streatham. His mother, Kate, died from acute peritonitis when he was 14, and his father lost his business 18 months later.

Lifelong poor eyesight caused his rejection by the British Army for World War I, but also developed his ability to visualize problems in geometrical terms, not in writing mathematical solutions, or proofs. He entered Harrow School age 14 and won the school&#x27;s Neeld Medal in mathematics. In 1909, he won a scholarship to study Mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In 1912, he gained a First in Mathematics. 
In 1915 he published a paper, &quot;The evolution of sexual preference&quot;, on sexual selection and mate choice.

==Career==
During 1913–1919, Fisher worked as a statistician in the City of London and taught physics and maths at a sequence of public schools, at the Thames Nautical Training College, and at Bradfield College. There he settled with his new bride, Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.

In 1918 he published &quot;The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance&quot;, in which he introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis. He put forward a genetics conceptual model showing that continuous variation amongst phenotypic traits measured by biostatisticians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes and thus be the result of Mendelian inheritance. This was the first step towards establishing population genetics and quantitative genetics, which demonstrated that natural selection could change allele frequencies in a population, reconciling its discontinuous nature with gradual evolution. Joan Box, Fisher&#x27;s biographer and daughter, says that Fisher had resolved this problem already in 1911. Today, Fisher&#x27;s additive model is still regularly used in genome-wide association studies.

===Rothamsted Experimental Station, 1919–1933===
In 1919, he began working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, where he would remain for 14 years. He had been offered a position at the Galton Laboratory in University College London led by Karl Pearson, but instead accepted a temporary role at Rothamsted to investigate the possibility of analysing the vast amount of crop data accumulated since 1842 from the &quot;Classical Field Experiments&quot;. He analysed the data recorded over many years, and in 1921 published &quot;Studies in Crop Variation I&quot;, his first application of the analysis of variance (ANOVA). &quot;Studies in Crop Variation II&quot; written with his first assistant, Winifred Mackenzie, became the model for later ANOVA work. Later assistants who mastered and propagated Fisher&#x27;s methods were Joseph Oscar Irwin, John Wishart and Frank Yates. Between 1912 and 1922 Fisher recommended, analysed (with heuristic proofs) and vastly popularized the maximum likelihood estimation method.

Fisher&#x27;s 1924 article &quot;On a distribution yielding the error functions of several well known statistics&quot; presented Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test and William Gosset&#x27;s Student&#x27;s t-distribution in the same framework as the Gaussian distribution, and is where he developed Fisher&#x27;s z-distribution, a new statistical method commonly used decades later as the &quot;F&quot;-distribution. He pioneered the principles of the design of experiments and the statistics of small samples and the analysis of real data.

In 1925 he published &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot;, one of the 20th century&#x27;s most influential books on statistical methods. Fisher&#x27;s method is a technique for data fusion or &quot;meta-analysis&quot; (analysis of analyses). Fisher formalized and popularized use of the p-value in statistics, which plays a central role in his approach. Fisher proposes the level p=0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applies this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance. The significance of 1.96, the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution used in probability and statistics, also originated in this book.

&quot;The value for which P = 0.05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not.&quot;

In Table 1 of the work, he gave the more precise value 1.959964.

In 1928, Fisher was the first to use diffusion equations to attempt to calculate the distribution of allele frequencies and the estimation of genetic linkage by maximum likelihood methods among populations.

In 1930, &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot; was first published by Clarendon Press and is dedicated to Leonard Darwin. A core work of the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis, it helped define population genetics, which Fisher founded alongside Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, and revived Darwin&#x27;s neglected idea of sexual selection.

One of Fisher&#x27;s favourite aphorisms was &quot;Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability.&quot;

Fisher&#x27;s fame grew, and he began to travel and lecture widely. In 1931, he spent six weeks at the Statistical Laboratory at Iowa State College where he gave three lectures per week, and met many American statisticians, including George W. Snedecor. He returned there again in 1936.

===University College London, 1933–1943===
In 1933, Fisher became the head of the Department of Eugenics at University College London. In 1934, he become editor of the &quot;Annals of Eugenics&quot; (now called &quot;Annals of Human Genetics&quot;).

In 1935, he published &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot;, which was &quot;also fundamental, [and promoted] statistical technique and application... The mathematical justification of the methods was not stressed and proofs were often barely sketched or omitted altogether ... [This] led H.B. Mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment&quot;. 
In this book Fisher also outlined the Lady tasting tea, now a famous design of a statistical randomized experiment which uses Fisher&#x27;s exact test and is the original exposition of Fisher&#x27;s notion of a null hypothesis.

The same year he also published a paper on fiducial inference and applied it to the Behrens–Fisher problem, the solution to which, proposed first by Walter Behrens and a few years later by Fisher, is the Behrens–Fisher distribution.

In 1936, he introduced the Iris flower data set as an example of discriminant analysis.

In his 1937 paper &quot;The wave of advance of advantageous genes&quot; he proposed Fisher&#x27;s equation in the context of population dynamics to describe the spatial spread of an advantageous allele, and explored its travelling wave solutions. Out of this also came the Fisher–Kolmogorov equation.
In 1937, he visited the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta, and its one part-time employee, P. C. Mahalanobis, often returning to encourage its development. He was the guest of honour at its 25th anniversary in 1957, when it had 2000 employees.

In 1938, Fisher and Frank Yates described the Fisher–Yates shuffle in their book &quot;Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research&quot;. Their description of the algorithm used pencil and paper; a table of random numbers provided the randomness.

===University of Cambridge, 1943–1956===
In 1943, along with A.S. Corbet and C.B. Williams he published a paper on relative species abundance where he developed the log series distribution (sometimes called the logarithmic distribution) to fit two different abundance data sets. In the same year he took the Balfour Chair of Genetics where the Italian researcher Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza was recruited in 1948, establishing a one-man unit of bacterial genetics.

In 1936, Fisher used a Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test to analyze Mendel&#x27;s data and concluded that Mendel&#x27;s results were far too perfect, suggesting that adjustments (intentional or unconscious) had been made to the data to make the observations fit the hypothesis. Later authors have claimed Fisher&#x27;s analysis was flawed, proposing various statistical and botanical explanations for Mendel&#x27;s numbers. In 1947, Fisher co-founded the journal &quot;Heredity&quot; with Cyril Darlington and in 1949 he published &quot;The Theory of Inbreeding.&quot;

In 1950, he published &quot;Gene Frequencies in a Cline Determined by Selection and Diffusion&quot;. He developed computational algorithms for analyzing data from his balanced experimental designs, with various editions and translations, becoming a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. In ecological genetics he and E. B. Ford showed that the force of natural selection was much stronger than had been assumed, with many ecogenetic situations (such as polymorphism) being maintained by the force of selection.

During this time he also worked on mouse chromosome mapping, breeding the mice in laboratories in his own house.

Fisher publicly spoke out against the 1950 study showing that smoking tobacco causes lung cancer, arguing that correlation does not imply causation. To quote his biographers Yates and Mather, &quot;It has been suggested that the fact that Fisher was employed as consultant by the tobacco firms in this controversy casts doubt on the value of his arguments. This is to misjudge the man. He was not above accepting financial reward for his labours, but the reason for his interest was undoubtedly his dislike and mistrust of puritanical tendencies of all kinds; and perhaps also the personal solace he had always found in tobacco.&quot; Others have suggested that his analysis was biased by professional conflicts and his own love of smoking; he was a heavy pipe smoker.

He gave the 1953 Croonian lecture on population genetics.

In the winter of 1954–1955 Fisher met Debabrata Basu, the Indian statistician who wrote in 1988, &quot;With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a &quot;via media&quot; between the two poles of Statistics – Berkeley and Bayes. My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the likelihood principle&quot;.

===Adelaide, 1957–1962===

In 1957, a retired Fisher emigrated to Australia, where he spent time as a senior research fellow at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Adelaide, South Australia. During this time, he continued in his denial of tobacco harm, and enlisted German eugenicist Otmar von Verschuer to his cause.

Following surgery for colon cancer, he died of post-operative complications in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide in 1962. His remains are interred in St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, Adelaide.

==Legacy==
Fisher&#x27;s doctoral students included Walter Bodmer, D. J. Finney, Ebenezer Laing, Mary F. Lyon and C. R. Rao. Although a prominent opponent of Bayesian statistics, Fisher was the first to use the term &quot;Bayesian&quot;, in 1950. The 1930 &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot; is commonly cited in biology books, and outlines many important concepts, such as:
* Parental investment, is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one offspring at a cost to parents&#x27; ability to invest in other components of fitness, 
* Fisherian runaway, explaining how the desire for a phenotypic trait in one sex combined with the trait in the other sex (for example a peacock&#x27;s tail) creates a runaway evolutionary extremizing of the trait.
* Fisher&#x27;s principle, which explains why the sex ratio is mostly 1:1 in nature.
* Reproductive value which implies that sexually reproductive value measures the contribution of an individual of a given age to the future growth of the population.
* Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection, which states that &quot;the rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time.&quot;
* Fisher&#x27;s geometric model, an evolutionary model of the effect sizes on fitness of spontaneous mutations proposed by Fisher to explain the distribution of effects of mutations that could contribute to adaptive evolution.
* Sexy son hypothesis, which hypothesizes that females may choose arbitrarily attractive male mates simply because they are attractive, thus increasing the attractiveness of their sons who attract more mates of their own. This is in contrast to theories of female mate choice based on the assumption that females choose attractive males because the attractive traits are markers of male viability.
* Mimicry, a similarity of one species to another that protects one or both.
* The evolution of dominance, a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus.
* Heterozygote advantage which was later found to play a frequent role in genetic polymorphism.
* Demonstrating that the probability of a mutation increasing the fitness of an organism decreases proportionately with the magnitude of the mutation and that larger populations carry more variation so that they have a greater chance of survival.

Fisher is also known for:

* Linear discriminant analysis is a generalization of Fisher&#x27;s linear discriminant 
* Fisher information, see also scoring algorithm also known as Fisher&#x27;s scoring, and Minimum Fisher information, a variational principle which, when applied with the proper constraints needed to reproduce empirically known expectation values, determines the best probability distribution that characterizes the system.
* &quot;F&quot;-distribution, arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance
* Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem: Fisher&#x27;s contribution to this was made in 1927
* Fisher–Tippett distribution 
* Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm 
* Von Mises–Fisher distribution 
* Inverse probability, a term Fisher used in 1922, referring to &quot;the fundamental paradox of inverse probability&quot; as the source of the confusion between statistical terms which refer to the true value to be estimated, with the actual value arrived at by estimation, which is subject to error. 
* Fisher&#x27;s permutation test
* Fisher&#x27;s inequality 
* Sufficient statistic, when a statistic is &quot;sufficient&quot; with respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter if &quot;no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter&quot;.
*Fisher&#x27;s noncentral hypergeometric distribution, a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution, where sampling probabilities are modified by weight factors.
* Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution, widely used in statistics.
* The concept of an ancillary statistic and the notion (the ancillarity principle) that one should condition on ancillary statistics.

==Personal life and beliefs==
Fisher married Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.
His marriage disintegrated during World War II, and his older son George, an aviator, was killed in combat. His daughter Joan, who wrote a biography of her father, married the statistician George E. P. Box.

According to Yates and Mather, &quot;His large family, in particular, reared in conditions of great financial stringency, was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions.&quot; Fisher was noted for being loyal, and was seen as a patriot, a member of the Church of England, politically conservative, as well as a scientific rationalist. He developed a reputation for carelessness in his dress and was the archetype of the absent-minded professor. H. Allen Orr describes him in the &quot;Boston Review&quot; as a &quot;deeply devout Anglican who, between founding modern statistics and population genetics, penned articles for church magazines&quot;. In a 1955 broadcast on Science and Christianity, he said:

Fisher was involved with the Society for Psychical Research.

==Views on race==
Between 1950 and 1951, Fisher, along with other leading geneticists and anthropologists of his time, was asked to comment on a statement that UNESCO was preparing on the nature of race and racial differences, which was published in 1950 as the UNESCO &quot;Statement on Race&quot;. The statement, along with the comments and criticisms of a large number of scientists including Fisher, is published in &quot;The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry&quot; (1952).

Fisher was one of four scientists who opposed the statement. In his own words, Fisher&#x27;s opposition is based on &quot;one fundamental objection to the Statement&quot;, which &quot;destroys the very spirit of the whole document.&quot; He believes that human groups differ profoundly &quot;in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development&quot; and concludes from this that the &quot;practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature, and that this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist.&quot;

Fisher&#x27;s opinions are clarified by his more detailed comments on Section 5 of the statement, which are concerned with psychological and mental differences between the races. Section 5 concludes as follows:

Of the entire statement, Section 5 recorded the most dissenting viewpoints. It was recorded that &quot;Fisher&#x27;s attitude … is the same as Muller&#x27;s and Sturtevant&#x27;s&quot;. Muller&#x27;s criticism was recorded in more detail and was noted to &quot;represent an important trend of ideas&quot;:

Fisher&#x27;s own words were quoted as follows:
Fisher also ended a 1954 letter to Reginald Ruggles Gates, a Canadian-born geneticist who argued that different racial groups were different species, with the words:
Fisher&#x27;s writings nearly all discuss human populations or humanity as a whole without reference to race or specific racial groups, and none of his work explicitly supports the idea of racial superiority or white supremacy. Fisher had a close personal relationship with Indian statistician P.C. Mahalanobis, and significantly contributed to the development of the Indian Statistical Institute; and Fisher&#x27;s graduate students included Walter Bodmer, a child of Jewish-German parents who fled from Nazi Germany while he was young, and Ebenezer Laing, an African geneticist from Ghana. Daniel Kevles, an American historian of science, described Fisher as an &quot;anti-racist conservative&quot;. However, British historian Robert J. Evans, writing in &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, argued that Fisher&#x27;s views on eugenics and his opposition to UNESCO&#x27;s statement about genetic racial differences were indicative of racism.

==Eugenics==

In 1911, Fisher became founding Chairman of the University of Cambridge Eugenics Society, whose other founding members included John Maynard Keynes, R. C. Punnett, and Horace Darwin. After members of the Cambridge Society – including Fisher – stewarded the First International Eugenics Congress in London in summer 1912, a link was forged with the Eugenics Society (UK). He saw eugenics as addressing pressing social and scientific issues that encompassed and drove his interest in both genetics and statistics. During World War I Fisher started writing book reviews for &quot;The Eugenics Review&quot; and volunteered to undertake all such reviews for the journal, being hired for a part-time position.

The last third of &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot; focused on eugenics, attributing the fall of civilizations to the fertility of their upper classes being diminished, and used British 1911 census data to show an inverse relationship between fertility and social class, which was partly due, he claimed, to the lower financial costs and hence increasing social status of families with fewer children. He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He served in several official committees to promote eugenics, including the Committee for Legalizing Eugenic Sterilization which drafted legislation aiming to limit the fertility of &quot;feeble minded high-grade defectives ... comprising a tenth of the total population&quot;. It was proposed that this policy would allow for voluntary sterilisation. Fisher was against the idea of forced sterilisation.

Beginning in 1934, Fisher became disillusioned with the Eugenics Society over concerns that its activities were increasingly aimed in a political rather than scientific direction; he formally dissociated with the Society in 1941.

Fisher wrote a testimony on behalf of the eugenicist Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer. He wrote that, although the Nazis used Verschuer&#x27;s work to give scientific support for their ideology, it was &quot;[Verschuer&#x27;s] misfortune rather than his fault that racial theory was a part of the Nazi ideology.&quot; He conducted extensive correspondence with von Verschuer over decades, which is held at the University of Adelaide.

==Recognition==
===Appraisal of scientific merits===
Fisher was elected to the Royal Society in 1929, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934, the American Philosophical Society in 1941, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948. He was made a Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 and awarded the Linnean Society of London Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1958.

He won the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 in Toronto and in 1928 in Bologna.

In 1950, Maurice Wilkes and David Wheeler used the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies in a paper by Ronald Fisher. This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology. The Kent distribution (also known as the Fisher–Bingham distribution) was named after him and Christopher Bingham in 1982, while the Fisher kernel was named after Fisher in 1998.

The R. A. Fisher Lectureship was a North American Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) annual lecture prize, established in 1963, until the name was changed to COPSS Distinguished Achievement Award and Lectureship in 2020. On 28 April 1998 a minor planet, 21451 Fisher, was named after him.

In 2010, the R.A. Fisher Chair in Statistical Genetics was established in University College London to recognise Fisher&#x27;s extraordinary contributions to both statistics and genetics.

Anders Hald called Fisher &quot;a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science&quot;, while Richard Dawkins named him &quot;the greatest biologist since Darwin&quot;: Not only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and experimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in biology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with the modern version of biology&#x27;s central theorem. 

Geoffrey Miller said of him:To biologists, he was an architect of the &quot;modern synthesis&quot; that used mathematical models to integrate Mendelian genetics with Darwin&#x27;s selection theories. To psychologists, Fisher was the inventor of various statistical tests that are still supposed to be used whenever possible in psychology journals. To farmers, Fisher was the founder of experimental agricultural research, saving millions from starvation through rational crop breeding programs.

=== Contentious views on eugenics ===
Fisher and Sewall Wright both contributed to the development of population genetics, which became part of the modern synthesis. The interpretation of the mathematical theories of population genetics became a bone of contention between Fisher and Wright by the mid-1920s, and the issue became acrimonious. Dispute persisted for the rest of Fisher&#x27;s life. A 2021 paper, authored by trustees of the &quot;Fisher Memorial Trust&quot;, commented that recent criticism of Fisher could mostly be characterised as &quot;reconsideration of the honour given to individuals from preceding times who are felt to have contributed to social injustice in the past, or to have held views that are felt to have promoted social injustice.&quot;

In June 2020, during the international protests caused by the murder of George Floyd, Gonville and Caius College announced that a 1989 stained-glass window commemorating Fisher&#x27;s work would be removed because of his connection with eugenics. An accommodation building, built in 2018 and previously named after him, was subsequently renamed too. University College London also decided to remove his name from its Centre for Computational Biology.

=== Contentious views on smoking===

Fisher rejected the notion of smoking cigarettes being dangerous, calling it &quot;propaganda&quot;.
