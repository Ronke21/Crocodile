==History==
A group of Mormon pioneers settled the area now known as Lehi in the fall of 1850 at a place called Dry Creek in the northernmost part of Utah Valley.

The settlement grew so rapidly that, in early 1852, Bishop Evans petitioned the Utah Territorial Legislature to incorporate the settlement. Lehi City was incorporated by legislative act on February 5, 1852. It was the sixth city incorporated in Utah. The legislature also approved a request to call the new city Lehi, after a Book of Mormon prophet of the same name. The first mayor of Lehi was Silas P. Barnes, from 1853 to 1854.

The downtown area has been designated the Lehi Main Street Historic District by the National Park Service and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Attractions===
====Lehi Roller Mills====
Lehi Roller Mills was founded in 1906 by a co-op of farmers. George G. Robinson purchased the mill in 1910, and it has since remained in the Robinson family, currently run by George&#x27;s grandson, R. Sherman Robinson. The mill produces some 100,000 pounds of flour each day.

The turkey and peacock flour paintings of Lehi Roller Mills were painted on the silos about 1930 by Stan Russon of Lehi, Utah. He used a rope and pulley system to manually raise and lower himself to be able to paint.

Lehi Roller Mills was featured in the 1984 film &quot;Footloose&quot; as Ren McCormack&#x27;s workplace and as the site of the dance. At the time the film was made, Lehi Roller Mills was surrounded by nothing but vacant fields. In one scene, the Reverend Shaw Moore and his wife Vi Moore keep a wary eye on the proceedings while standing in a field some distance away. The area is now home to a variety of fast food restaurants and a shopping center.

The Lehi Roller Mills were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

In 2012, the Mills filed for bankruptcy with the intention of continuing to operate during the proceedings.

Thanksgiving Point is a nonprofit museum complex and estate garden founded in 1995. It consists of six main attractions: the Ashton Gardens, Thanksgiving Point Golf Course, the Museum of Ancient Life, the Museum of Natural Curiosity, Farm Country, and the Butterfly Biosphere.

It is the site for the region&#x27;s only Tulip Festival, an annual Scottish Festival, annual Cornbelly&#x27;s Halloween attraction, and Highland Games.

The Hutchings Museum is a museum located near the center of Lehi. It was first established in 1955 in what is now the Lehi Arts Building. The museum later moved its current location in the Veteran Memorial Building at 55 N Center St, Lehi, UT. The collection was donated to the city by John and Eunice Hutchings, who were amateur collectors and naturalists.

Originally designed to be a memorial for the veterans in World War I, the Veteran Memorial Building later expanded to host a library, courthouse, jail, police station, and fire station, among others.

The Hutchings Museum&#x27;s exhibits include a large range of displays and artifacts featuring Native American culture, geology and paleontology, ornithology, live animals, and both local city and regional history.

Some of the Museum&#x27;s most notable artifacts include a gun that reportedly belonged to Butch Cassidy, a large collection of rocks and minerals, and several pieces of Native American pottery. The museum has online articles, photos, videos, 3-D scans of artifacts, and a virtual tour.

<text>Lindon is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 10,070 at the 2010 census. In July 2019 it was estimated to be to 11,100 by the US Census Bureau.

== History ==
Originally settled in 1861, Lindon began as pioneers moved into what was then the Lindon grazing land. The town was originally named &quot;String Town&quot; because of the way the houses were strung up and down the street between the towns of Orem and Pleasant Grove. An old linden tree (Tilia) growing in town in 1901 inspired the present (misspelled) name. Over the past century Lindon has seen organized development, but it has tried to remain true to its motto: &quot;Lindon: a little bit of country&quot;.

The area was first settled in 1850, and for a time was known as Union Bench. It started as an agricultural extension of Springville. Legal action between residents of Springville and what became Mapleton, largely over water rights, allowed Mapleton to chart its course beginning in 1901 when the community incorporated as a town. Mapleton became a city in 1948.

The city is dominated by Spanish Fork Peak to the southeast and Ether Peak to the northeast. Between the two mountains is Maple Canyon, which is home to Whiting Campground in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. Mapleton residents continue to call Spanish Fork Peak &quot;Maple Mountain&quot;, despite the U.S. Board on Geographic Names having opted for the name that refers to the river and canyon that form its south base. The mountain has also been informally referred to as Sierra Bonita and Monument Peak. The city is bounded to the north by Hobble Creek and extends southward to the Ensign-Bickford plant in Spanish Fork. The Mapleton Lateral Canal crosses the eastern side of the city, and the Bureau of Reclamation began piping it in 2007.

==Today==
Mapleton is still a somewhat rural area but is rapidly suburbanizing in the wake of development. Numerous large subdivisions have been approved in recent years. None of the city touches Interstate 15, which has kept the city more rural than neighboring Springville and Spanish Fork. The main artery through town is U.S. Route 89. Mapleton uses innovative planning techniques, including Transferable Development Rights (TDRs), to preserve the foothills. Many of the homes are located on large lots, with most minimum lot sizes ranging from one-third acre to .

There are two restaurants in Mapleton - Subway, located at the intersection of Highway 89 and Maple Street, and Guadalajara Mexican Food, located at the intersection of Highway 89 and 800 North.

<text>Payson is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 21,101 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pioneers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints led by James Edward Pace Jr. first settled what is now Payson, Utah. On Sunday, October 20, 1850, Pace with his family and the families of John Courtland Searle and Andrew Jackson Stewart, totaling 16 settlers in all, arrived at their destination on Peteetneet Creek.

The settlement was originally named Peteetneet Creek, after which Chief Peteetneet was named. Peteetneet is the anglicized approximation of &quot;Pah-ti&#x27;t-ni&#x27;t&quot;, which in the Timpanogos dialect of the Southern Paiute language means &quot;our water place&quot;. Chief Peteetneet was the clan leader of a band of Timpanogos Indigenous Americans whose village was on a stretch of the creek about a mile northwest of Payson&#x27;s present city center. The village, when fully occupied, housed more than 200 of Chief Peteetneet&#x27;s clan and near kinsmen. It served as a base from which seasonal hunting and foraging parties moved to the mountains each summer and fall.

Five months later, on the morning of March 23, 1851, Brigham Young, having lost confidence in the leadership of James Pace, released him from his calling and reorganized the community under Bishop Benjamin Cross. Then, in the afternoon, in a secular meeting, Brigham Young acting as Territorial Governor, designated the settlement on Peteetneet Creek as Payson, Utah County, Utah Territory. He acknowledged naming the town after Payson, Illinois, a small town in Adams County near Quincy where kind citizens had taken in the Young family after they were driven from Missouri in 1839.

In January 1853, Territorial Governor Brigham Young submitted a bill to the Second Utah Territorial Legislature to incorporate Payson as a city. On January 21, 1853, on the last day of the legislative session, the legislature passed the act. Brigham Young signed it. And Payson became an incorporated city within a strip of territory two miles wide on either side of Peteetneet Creek, extending from the shore Utah Lake to the top of the mountains to the south. On April 12, 1853, Payson voters elected a city council composed of aldermen and councilmen, the distinction between the two being uncertain. The voters also elected as the town&#x27;s first mayor, David Crockett who had returned to Payson after James Pace&#x27;s fall from power. He would serve as Mayor for 2 additional two-year terms and as an alderman until 1860.

On March 6, 1854, the LDS Church organized the Payson Ward as part of the Utah Stake with C. B. Hancock as Bishop and James McClellan and John Fairbanks as counselors. Bishop Cross, who was in declining health died on December 31 at age 65.

The Payson Tabernacle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was dedicated by Wilford Woodruff in 1872.

In 1873 the Payson independent school District established a high school, the first such institution in Utah south of Salt Lake City. It closed in 1876 after Brigham Young Academy opened in Provo, and a Presbyterian mission school offering education through grade 12 was established under Rev. Wildman Murphy. An opera house was built in Payson in 1883. In the late 1800s, a factory making horse collars operated in Payson.

When the Strawberry Valley Reclamation Project was completed in 1912, the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company decided to place a sugar beet processing factory in the area. The plant was completed in October 1913. By 1915, the biggest year for the factory, were planted, yielding 36,915 tons of sugar beets, which were processed into 7,722 tons of sugar.

In 1897, the beet leafhopper, &quot;Circulifer tenellus&quot;, the only known vector of the beet curly top virus (BCTV), invaded Utah County. Its transmission of the disease caused serious crop losses in Payson, Lehi and other areas of the county. As the disease grew worse, Payson farmers reduced beet acreage and planted other crops. Those willing to take a chance with beet contracts experienced declining yields. In 1924, beet growers all over Utah County experienced a complete crop failure. The result was that in 1924, Utah-Idaho Sugar closed its Payson and Lehi sugar factories. The factory was dismantled and demolished in 1940, leaving only the sugar warehouse. Beet contracts continued to be signed in the Payson area, and harvests were processed in the Utah-Idaho Sugar factory in Spanish Fork.

In 1940, the sugar factory property, which included only the sugar warehouse, was sold to the Utah Poultry Producers Co-operative Association (now Intermountain Farmers Association = IFA Country Stores), which used the building for grain storage until 1978. In 1979, this property located at 10460 South 4400 West in Payson became the present IFA fertilizer storage, blending, packaging and distribution facility.

==Culture==

Payson is the site of the annual Scottish Heritage Festival, held every July. Other annual festivities include a salmon supper, held every August, and the annual Onion Days festival, held every Labor Day weekend. The city also has band concerts in the Memorial Park, and has had such concerts since the early 1950s.

Payson is where most of the 1984 hit movie &quot;Footloose&quot; was filmed, in settings such as Payson High School and Sudsie&#x27;s, a local car wash. The town was also one of the locations for the 1985 thriller &quot;Warning Sign&quot;. Payson was the setting of the 1979 children&#x27;s movie &quot;Banjo the Woodpile Cat.&quot; The town is a film favorite for seminary videos filmed by the LDS Church. The popular Mormon film &quot;Baptists at Our Barbecue&quot; was also shot on Payson&#x27;s historic Main Street. Most recently, Payson was used to film most of the Disney Channel movie &quot;Hatching Pete&quot;.

Payson was originally named &quot;Peteetneet&quot;, after a Ute Indian chief who lived near Payson&#x27;s current location. A monument still stands to Chief Peteetneet at the Peteetneet Museum and Cultural Arts Center, originally the first school in Payson. The Peteetneet Museum is a historical gem in the community and is known for its historical significance, beauty, and great sledding. A committee headed by Marva Loy Eggett has recently raised funds for the Peteetneet Museum glass elevator. Construction was completed on it the summer of 2008.

Payson celebrates its heritage through monuments such as the historic Main Street, Peteetneet Museum and Cultural Arts Center, and several Payson Historical Society markers that note houses and other sites in the city over a hundred years old.

The city was the birthplace of singer-songwriter Jewel.

It is the hometown of Disney animator and film producer Don Bluth.

The city has large numbers of persons with Scottish and Scots-Irish ancestry. However, the expansion of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area into Payson has changed the city&#x27;s ethnic and religious makeup with additions of Catholic (including Eastern Rite Catholic and Greek Catholic brought in by Greek, Italian and Yugoslav settlers), Presbyterian, Evangelical, and Wiccan. Payson, like Provo, has a predominantly Latter-day Saint population, but other religious sects and denominations such as Lutherans, Methodists, Roman Catholics and Southern Baptists. The imprint of Scandinavian settlement is found in thousands of residents with Scandinavian (i.e. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic) surnames; Swiss people and Austrians; and since the 1930s, Mexican Americans among a few other Hispanics and Latinos.

On January 25, 2010, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced that a temple was to be built in Payson, the Payson Utah Temple. With construction completed before dedication on June 7, 2015, the Temple is the 15th in Utah and the 146th in the world.

==Schools==

Payson is served by Nebo School District. Public schools in this district within Payson include the following: Payson High School, Payson Junior High School, Mt. Nebo Middle, Barnett Elementary, Parkview Elementary, Springlake Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Wilson Elementary. Payson High School is one of the very few schools in the USA that has its own Bagpipe Band..

== Annual events ==
Payson is home to the Onion Days and Salmon Supper events held every August and an annual Scottish Festival.

=== The Origins of Payson Onion Days: A Historical Journey ===
At the turn of the 20th century, many farmers in the Payson area faced significant hardships. Among them was Charlie Gale, a determined farmer seeking a viable crop to sustain his livelihood. His son, Elmer Gale, played a pivotal role in transforming the local agricultural landscape. Elmer, who made his living by purchasing crops from farmers and reselling them to local grocers, suggested that his father try growing onions, a crop that was in shorter supply and promised higher returns.

Elmer&#x27;s suggestion proved to be fortuitous. Onions quickly became a lucrative cash crop for Charlie Gale, a respected early settler of Payson, who became one of the biggest onion producers in Payson history. Witnessing Charlie&#x27;s success, other farmers in the Payson area soon followed suit, switching to onion cultivation. By 1929, Payson had established itself as a prominent agricultural district and an outstanding producer of onions.

Around this time, many communities across the country were initiating their own harvest festivals. Inspired by this trend, the residents of Payson decided to start their own celebration. They aimed to honor the town&#x27;s agricultural heritage and its significant contribution to onion production. Thus, the Onion Harvest and Homecoming was born.

To pay tribute to Elmer Gale&#x27;s influential role in the town&#x27;s agricultural success, the inaugural Onion Days festival was suggested to be held on his birthday, September 2, 1929, though it was eventually moved to Sept 12-14th, 1929. The celebration became an annual event, marking the town&#x27;s deep-rooted connection to onion farming and community spirit.

==History==

===Settlement and incorporation===
On July 19, 1850, William H. Adams, John Mercer and Philo T. Farnsworth, Mormon pioneers sent by Brigham Young, arrived at the area now known as Pleasant Grove and staked out farms in what is now the southwest corner of the city. A small community was established September 13, 1850, consisting of George S. Clark and his wife, Susannah Dalley Clark, Richard and Ann Elizabeth Sheffer Clark, John Greenleaf Holman and Nancy Clark Holman, Lewis Harvey and his wife Lucinda Clark Harvey, Johnathan Harvey and Sarah Herbert Harvey, Charles Price and wife and child, Widow Harriet Marler and children, John Wilson, Ezekiel Holman, and possibly one or two others, relatives of those mentioned. Of note, William Fletcher and Anne Hawley Reynolds in 1852 brought Ellis Reynolds Shipp to live, which Shipp became the legendary MD, Obstetrician, and Pediatrician, through the young women&#x27;s midwife training program of Dr. Richards and Eliza Snow, beginning her training in young women&#x27;s MIA in Pleasant Grove. Pleasant Grove was officially incorporated as a town January 18, 1855, by which time the settlement had grown to 623 people.

===Early relations with Native Americans===
The original name of the city was Battle Creek. It was named for a massacre which took place there in 1849 between Mormon settlers and a small band of Ute Indians, wherein all the male Utes were massacred when Brigham Young believed the natives had stolen some of his horses (which were found before the attack on the Utes occurred). The settlers later decided they needed a more uplifting name and began calling their town Pleasant Grove after a grove of cottonwood trees located between Battle Creek and Grove Creek, near the current-day intersection of Locust Avenue and Battle Creek Drive. A monument with a plaque describing this battle is located at Kiwanis Park, at the mouth of Battle Creek Canyon.

During the Walker Indian War in the 1850s, citizens built a fort with walls two or three feet thick and six feet tall that occupied an area the size of sixteen city blocks. The settlers in the area at the time built homes inside the fort. While the fort no longer stands, memorial cornerstones were erected by local historians. The northeast monument was erected near the intersection of 100 North and 300 East streets. The northwest monument was erected four blocks west of that point at 100 West Street and the southeast monument erected four blocks south at 300 South Street. The southwest monument would have been located near 300 South 100 West, the area is now occupied by a large parking lot and retail store.

===Media appearances===
This city was one of the filming locations for Universal&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain&quot;. Portions of the 1994 television series &quot;The Stand&quot;, adapted from the Stephen King novel, were filmed in Pleasant Grove.

==Geography==

Timpanogos bench, Pleasant Grove is represented by a large, white hillside letter &quot;G&quot; just above the city. A small distance south on Battle Creek Canyon is the creek of the same name and tall Battle Creek Falls.

The average household size was 3.83 and the average family size was 4.11.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 41.0% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 28.0% from 25 to 44, 13.8% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Strawberry Days==
Pleasant Grove is home to the summer festival known as Strawberry Days. The first annual “Strawberry Day” (initially a single-day event) was held on June 21, 1922, with 10,000-15,000 people in attendance. The festival was organized by the Wasatch Club, a forerunner of today’s Chamber of Commerce. This first celebration included strawberries and cream and a parade; both remain staples of modern-day Strawberry Days.

The festival’s name originated when strawberry farming was a major economic activity in the city. (Approximately 250 acres of strawberries were being grown in the area when the first festival was held in 1922). The festival retains the traditional name, even though large-scale commercial growing of the fruit no longer occurs in the city. The festival is Utah’s second oldest community harvest festival, younger only than Brigham City&#x27;s Peach Days–a festival Strawberry Days’ founders hoped to rival.

Today, a rodeo held in conjunction with this festival brings competitors and spectators from throughout the West. The festival includes parades, a carnival, pageants and other activities. The festival is usually held the third week of June, a period chosen in 1922, which would generally correspond with the end of the strawberry harvest for the area.

==First amendment case==

In November 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of &quot;Pleasant Grove City v. Summum&quot;. The case regarded whether Pleasant Grove, which allowed the display of a privately-donated Ten Commandments on public property, must also allow the religion of Summum to display a monument to its &quot;Seven Aphorisms&quot; alongside. Pleasant Grove had declined the Summum offer in 2003. The city lost in the Tenth Circuit. However, the city appealed to the Supreme Court which overturned the Court of Appeals decision, citing the permanence of monuments as opposed to forms of constitutionally-protected free speech as well as the fact that governments take ownership of monuments on their properties and thus must &quot;take some care in accepting donated monuments.&quot;

==Education==

Public schools in Pleasant Grove are part of the Alpine School District. Charter schools include John Hancock Charter School and Lincoln Academy. Liahona Preparatory Academy is an accredited K-12 private school serving the area.

==History==

Santaquin, one of the early settlements along the Salt Lake Road, was originally settled in late 1851. It was originally named Summit City because of its location near the summit of the divide between Utah Valley and Juab Valley. Summit City was settled by pioneers who were helping settle nearby Payson to the north. In 1856 it was renamed &quot;Santaquin&quot; for the son of Guffich, a local native chieftain friendly to the settlers. Santaquin incorporated as a town in the 1890s and changed to a city effective January 4, 1932.

<text>Saratoga Springs is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. The elevation is 4,505 feet. It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is a relatively new development along the northwestern shores of Utah Lake. It was incorporated on December 31, 1997 and has been growing rapidly since then. The population was 37,696 at the 2020 Census. Saratoga Springs became a city in 2001.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.61 square miles (26.8 km2), of which 16.51 square miles (26.4 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.3 km2) (1.26%) is water. (This water is mostly Utah Lake.)

==History==
The natural hot springs near the source of the Jordan River inspired early European-American settlers to create a resort known as Beck&#x27;s Saratoga Springs, named after the original New York resort and owner John Beck. The Beck family opened their resort in 1884 and used it as their residence. With several lodge buildings and amusement park facilities, the resort became a popular location for tourists and visitors. The original buildings were taken down. The resort area has now been redeveloped privately, containing an outdoor pool, clubhouse, bowery, and kitchen facility for groups and parties.

In the early 1990s, landowners began to investigate the possibilities of developing the land around the hot springs and in the foothill locations of the nearby Lake Mountains range. The Utah County land development ordinances were not sufficiently urban in nature, so several landowners sought incorporation as a town. Subsequently, Saratoga Springs incorporated in December 1997. Several hundred acres have since been annexed into the City limits and the City now occupies a somewhat narrow strip running north and south between Utah Lake and the Jordan River on the East and the foothills to the west. The City contains over twenty-one square miles and runs from Pelican Point on the west side of Utah Lake over eleven miles north to the Camp Williams US Army facility in the foothills between Utah and Salt Lake Counties.

On April 2, 2017, Thomas S. Monson, then president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, announced that a temple of the church would be built in Saratoga Springs. The Saratoga Springs Utah Temple&#x27;s open house was held April to July 2023, and was dedicated on August 13, 2023.

On June 28, 2020, a wildfire known as the Knolls Fire forced the evacuation of around 13,000 people in 3,100 homes in Saratoga Springs.

<doc id="137168" wikidata="Q482552" url="?curid=137168" title="Spanish Fork, Utah">
<text>Spanish Fork is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem metropolitan area. The 2020 census reported a population of 42,602. Spanish Fork is the 20th largest city in Utah based on official 2017 estimates from the US Census Bureau.

Spanish Fork lies in the Utah Valley, with the Wasatch Range to the east and Utah Lake to the northwest. I-15 passes the northwest side of the city. Payson is approximately six miles to the southwest, Springville lies about four miles to the northeast, and Salem is approximately 4.5 miles to the south.

==History==
Spanish Fork was settled in 1851 by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as part of the Mormon Pioneers&#x27; settlement of Utah Territory. Its name derives from a visit to the area by two Franciscan friars from Spain, Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez in 1776, who followed the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to the Spanish missions in California, along a route later followed by fur trappers. They described the area inhabited by Native Americans as having &quot;spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements... Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds it—many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.&quot;

In 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement. However, a larger group congregated at what became known as the Lower Settlement just over a mile northwest of the present center of Spanish Fork along the Spanish Fork river. In December 1851, Stephen Markham, who was severely wounded outside Carthage Jail in Carthage, Illinois while attempting to defend Joseph Smith and other church leaders from a mob in 1844, became the president of the first church congregation (branch) at the Lower Settlement.

In 1852, Latter-day Saints founded a settlement called Palmyra west of the historic center of Spanish Fork. George A. Smith supervised the laying out of a townsite, including a temple square in that year. A fort and a school were built at the Palmyra site in 1852. With the onset of the Walker War in 1853, most of the farmers in the region who were not yet in the Palmyra fort moved in. Some of the people did not like this site and so moved to a different site at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon, where they built a structure they called &quot;Fort St. Luke&quot;. Also in 1854 there was a fort founded approximately south of the center of Spanish Fork that later was known as the &quot;Old Fort&quot;.

Between 1855 and 1860, the arrival of pioneers from Iceland made Spanish Fork the first permanent Icelandic settlement in the United States. The city also lent its name to the 1865 Treaty of Spanish Fork, where the Utes were forced by an Executive Order of President Abraham Lincoln to relocate to the Uintah Basin.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Spanish Fork has a dry-summer continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsa&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers.

==Demographic==

As of the 2010 census, there were 34,691 people, 9,069 households, and 7,885 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,252.7 people per square mile (871.6/km). There were 9,440 housing units, at an average density of 613.0 per square mile (237.2/km). The ethnical makeup of the city was 90.9% European American, 0.4% African American, 0.5% Native American, 0.6% Asian, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 4.4% some other ethnicity, and 2.5% from two or more ethnicities. Hispanic or Latino of any ethnicity were 10.6% of the population. As for ages, the population was quite young with 40.9% being under the age of 18, 53.6% aged 18–64 and 5.5% over the age of 65.

At the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the city was $62,805, and the median income for a family was $64,909. The per capita income for the city was $17,162. About 4.3% of families and 6.2% of the population were below the poverty line.

==Economy==
Spanish Fork has a predominantly LDS population. There are seventy-four LDS wards in nine stakes in the southern Utah Valley and a temple, the Payson Utah Temple, which opened in June 2015. The majority of residents are Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just like all of Utah County.

There are other churches in town: the Presbyterian Church established a church and mission day school in 1882. The school functioned until the state school system was inaugurated in the early part of the twentieth century. Today there are nine public elementary schools, two intermediate, and two high schools of the Nebo School District.

A Lutheran church, established by immigrants from Iceland, was built on the east bench of Spanish Fork. There is also the Faith Baptist Church, a Baptist congregation.

A Roman Catholic church serves the Catholics of southern Utah Valley; many happen to be of Italian descent (see Utah Italians), Hispanics, Filipino Americans, and some Greek Catholics from the Balkans.

ISKCON, the international society of Krishna Consciousness, have built a temple in Spanish Fork, run by Caru Das, the temple priest. Indian Americans form a small but noticeable community in the Spanish Fork-Provo area (especially in the neighboring town of Springville).

In Utah Valley&#x27;s historical settlement by immigrants, Scandinavians (most notably Icelanders); as well as Swiss people; Spanish Americans, Hispanics or Latinos; English Americans, Irish Americans and Scottish Americans are prevalent ethnocultural groups in Spanish Fork, and the nearby towns of Salem and Payson.

==Arts and culture==
===Sights===
The Angelus Theatre in Spanish Fork hosts live shows, collaborating with theater companies including &quot;Great Hall Theatrical Experiences&quot; and&quot;Cobb&amp;Co&quot;, and other events such as live music or rock bands.

===Events===
Spanish Fork City hosts five large-scale events each year: Fiesta Days, Icelandic Days, the Harvest Moon Hurrah, the Festival of Lights, and the Festival of Colors.

====Icelandic Days====
The Icelandic Association of Utah was founded in 1897 and hosts Iceland Days every year. The association picked June because Icelandic Independence Day, or National Day, is June 17.

Spanish Fork was the first Icelandic settlement in the United States, after Icelanders who joined the Church of Jesus Christ were expelled from that country, according to association spokesman Glenn Grossman. Although other nationalities helped found the town, under colonizer Brigham Young, Icelanders kept their identity and celebrate it with their culture every year during the three-day event.

====Harvest Moon Hurrah====
The Harvest Moon Hurrah is sponsored by the Spanish Fork Arts Council and takes place on a Saturday in September closest to the date of the full moon. Activities include children&#x27;s crafts and activities, a giant paint-it-yourself mural, storyteller, old-fashioned family photos, caricature artist, clown and balloon animals, hay rides with live bluegrass band, and live entertainment. The 2009 Hurrah was headlined by Peter Breinholt, a local musician.
====Festival of Colors====
The Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple (erected by Christopher Warden, an International Society for Krishna Consciousness follower) celebrates Holi and is known for the &quot;Festival of Colors&quot; where thousands of people gather from all over the country.
====Fiesta Days====
Each year Spanish Fork hosts the &quot;Fiesta Days&quot;. The event is held every July, and is centered around the Pioneer Day Celebration. There are a number of entertainment events, including a rodeo, craft fair, parade, duck race, and a fireworks show on the 24th.

==Government==
Spanish Fork has a council-manager form of government.

==Education==
In 1862, Spanish Fork built its first school house. That one room edifice served the city&#x27;s educational needs for nearly 50 years. In 1910, Spanish Fork built the Thurber School on Main Street. Although it&#x27;s not used for daily K-12 classes anymore, it still functions as a city office building. Today, Spanish Fork is served by the Nebo School District. Public schools in this district within Spanish Fork include the following:

* Spanish Fork High School
* Maple Mountain High School
* Landmark High School (alternative school)
* Spanish Fork Junior High School
* Diamond Fork Middle School (formerly known as Diamond Fork Junior High School)
* Brockbank Elementary
* Canyon Elementary
* Larsen Elementary
* Park Elementary
* Rees Elementary
* Riverview Elementary School
* East Meadows Elementary
* Sierra Bonita Elementary
* Maple Ridge Elementary
In addition, there is a private girls school, the New Haven School, and a K-12 charter school, the American Leadership Academy.

==Infrastructure==
===Alternative energy===
In September 2008, the Spanish Fork Wind Project was completed. This project, a 9-turbine wind energy project, can produce up to 18.9 megawatts at full production, and the nine turbines can power up to 6,000 typical homes. It is a utility-scale wind farm producing electricity from wind power.

<text>Spring Lake is a town in southern Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 458 at the 2010 census. It is located just south of Payson and northeast of Santaquin.

==Description==
Much of Spring Lake consists of farms and ranches, with many people owning horses, cattle, and raising alfalfa and hay for their animals. Being located between Payson and Santaquin, the rural area may give way to more homes in the coming years, but as there is no city water for many, wells are needed which place a limit of one house per of land. Only when city water is provided will greater housing density be possible.

The main transportation route through the city is Utah State Route 198 (South State Street), which follows the former routing of U.S. Route 6 and the pre-1974 routing of U.S. Route 91. Although Interstate 15 (I-15) forms the western border of Spring Lake, there is no direct access to the freeway within the community. There are no businesses or stoplights in Spring Lake as of 2018.

==History==
Spring Lake was the birthplace of Antonga Black Hawk, the famous Ute leader. Antonga led many raids on settlements during Utah&#x27;s Black Hawk War. After his death in 1870 he was buried in Spring Lake. In 1911 his body was discovered by miners, and moved to an LDS Church museum in Salt Lake City, but was later returned to Spring Lake.

As of July 2023, the Spring Lake community had begun the process of becoming an incorporated town. While the Spring Lake CDP is entirely east of I-15, the proposed town&#x27;s limits would extend west to South 5200 West, resulting in about one-third of the town being west of the freeway, with common borders with Payson on the north and Santaquin on the south. (As of February 2024, the only paved road that would connect the community on both sides of I-15 would be West 12400 South.)

Residents of the community voted in favor of incorporation in the 2024 General Election, with 66% in favor and 34% against. Community residents will decide on initial terms for municipal officers who will then be elected in 2025. Proponents of incorporation indicated intent for all utilities and services to continue through the county or private contracts, with the new municipal council focusing on regulating new residential development in the town

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.91%, is water.

Spring Lake is at approximately above sea level. The small lake of the same name is only a few feet deep under normal conditions, but in the spring of 2006 the lake was drained in order to dredge it and make it deeper. It was then refilled in the fall of 2006 and now contains trout.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 469 people, 129 households, and 110 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 236.8 people per square mile (91.5/km2). There were 134 housing units at an average density of 67.7/sq mi (26.1/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 85.50% White, 0.21% Native American, 0.43% Asian, 0.21% Pacific Islander, 11.73% from other races, and 1.92% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.86% of the population.

There were 129 households, out of which 45.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 78.3% were married couples living together, 5.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 14.7% were non-families. 13.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.64 and the average family size was 4.01.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 33.9% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 24.7% from 25 to 44, 22.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.9 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $38,646, and the median income for a family was $38,958. Males had a median income of $28,929 versus $37,692 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $15,314. About 6.0% of families and 10.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.8% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

<text>Vineyard is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population grew from 139 at the 2010 census to 12,543 at the 2020 census making it the fastest growing city in Utah and one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation during that timeframe. Population has grown dramatically since about 2012 due to redevelopment of the former Geneva Steel site which sits in Vineyard.

==History==
The community was named for grape vineyards near the original town site. According to some town residents, Vineyard first became a distinct place in 1899. The town incorporated in 1989.
Vineyard was certified as a city of the 5th class (1,000 - 10,000 residents) during the summer of 2016. Prior to 2016, Vineyard was classified as a town.

Population has grown dramatically since about 2012 due to redevelopment of the former Geneva Steel site which sits in Vineyard. In 2014 Utah Valley University purchased 125 acres of the Geneva Steel site in order to expand to a new “West” Campus.

Some of the battles between the Native Americans and early Mormon settlers following Brigham Young&#x27;s extermination order likely took place along the lake in or near current day Vineyard.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and

<doc id="137174" wikidata="Q750469" url="?curid=137174" title="I²C">
<text>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit; pronounced as “” or “”), alternatively known as I2C or IIC, is a synchronous, multi-master/multi-slave, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductors. It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral integrated circuits (ICs) to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication.

Several competitors, such as Siemens, NEC, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Motorola, Nordic Semiconductor and Intersil, have introduced compatible I2C products to the market since the mid-1990s.

I2C bus can be found in a wide range of electronics applications where simplicity and low manufacturing cost are more important than speed. PC components and systems which involve I2C are serial presence detect (SPD) EEPROMs on dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) for monitors via VGA, DVI and HDMI connectors, accessing NVRAM chips, etc. Common I2C applications include reading hardware monitors, sensors, real-time clocks, controlling actuators, accessing low-speed DACs and ADCs, controlling simple LCD or OLED displays, changing computer display settings (e.g. backlight, contrast, hue, color balance) via Display Data Channel, and changing speaker volume.

A particular strength of I2C is the capability of a microcontroller to control a network of device chips with just two general-purpose I/O pins and software. Many other bus technologies used in similar applications, such as Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI), require more pins and signals to connect multiple devices.

System Management Bus (SMBus), defined by Intel and Duracell in 1994, is a subset of I2C, defining a stricter usage. One purpose of SMBus is to promote robustness and interoperability. Accordingly, modern I2C systems incorporate some policies and rules from SMBus, sometimes supporting both I2C and SMBus, requiring only minimal reconfiguration either by commanding or output pin use. System management for PC systems uses SMBus whose pins are allocated in both conventional PCI and PCI Express connectors.

==Design==
I2C uses only two signals: serial data line (SDA) and serial clock line (SCL). Both are bidirectional and pulled up with resistors. Typical voltages used are +5 V or +3.3 V, although systems with other voltages are permitted.

The I2C reference design has a 7-bit address space, with a rarely used 10-bit extension. Common I2C bus speeds are the &quot;standard mode&quot; and the &quot;fast mode&quot;. There is also a &quot;low-speed mode&quot;, but arbitrarily low clock frequencies are also allowed. Later revisions of I2C can host more nodes and run at faster speeds ( &quot;fast mode&quot;, &quot;fast mode plus&quot;, &quot;high-speed mode&quot;, and &quot;ultra-fast mode&quot;). These speeds are more widely used on embedded systems than on PCs.

Note that the bit rates are quoted for the transfers between controller (master) and target (slave) without clock stretching or other hardware overhead. Protocol overheads include a target address and perhaps a register address within the target device, as well as per-byte ACK/NACK bits. Thus the actual transfer rate of user data is lower than those peak bit rates alone would imply. For example, if each interaction with a target inefficiently allows only 1 byte of data to be transferred, the data rate will be less than half the peak bit rate.

The number of nodes which can exist on a given I2C bus is limited by the address space and also by the total bus capacitance of 400 pF, which restricts practical communication distances to a few meters. The relatively high impedance and low noise immunity requires a common ground potential, which again restricts practical use to communication within the same PC board or small system of boards.

===Reference design===
The aforementioned reference design is a bus with a clock (SCL) and data (SDA) lines with 7-bit addressing. The bus has two roles for nodes, either controller (master) or target (slave):
* Controller (master) node: Node that generates the clock and initiates communication with targets (slaves).
* Target (slave) node: Node that receives the clock and responds when addressed by the controller (master).

The bus is a multi-controller bus, which means that any number of controller nodes can be present. Additionally, controller and target roles may be changed between messages (after a STOP is sent).

There may be four potential modes of operation for a given bus device, although most devices only use a single role and its two modes:
* Controller (master) transmit: Controller node is sending data to a target (slave).
* Controller (master) receive: Controller node is receiving data from a target (slave).
* Target (slave) transmit: Target node is sending data to the controller (master).
* Target (slave) receive: Target node is receiving data from the controller (master).

In addition to 0 and 1 data bits, the I2C bus allows special START and STOP signals which act as message delimiters and are distinct from the data bits. (This is in contrast to the start bits and stop bits used in asynchronous serial communication, which are distinguished from data bits only by their timing.)

The controller is initially in controller transmit mode by sending a START followed by the 7-bit address of the target it wishes to communicate with, which is finally followed by a single bit representing whether it wishes to write (0) to or read (1) from the target.

If the target exists on the bus then it will respond with an ACK bit (active low for acknowledged) for that address. The controller then continues in either transmit or receive mode (according to the read/write bit it sent), and the target continues in the complementary mode (receive or transmit, respectively).

The address and the data bytes are sent most significant bit first. The start condition is indicated by a high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high; the stop condition is indicated by a low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high. All other transitions of SDA take place with SCL low.

If the controller wishes to write to the target, then it repeatedly sends a byte with the target sending an ACK bit. (In this situation, the controller is in controller transmit mode, and the target is in target receive mode.)

If the controller wishes to read from the target, then it repeatedly receives a byte from the target, the controller sending an ACK bit after every byte except the last one. (In this situation, the controller is in controller receive mode, and the target is in target transmit mode.)

An I2C transaction may consist of multiple messages. The controller terminates a message with a STOP condition if this is the end of the transaction or it may send another START condition to retain control of the bus for another message (a &quot;combined format&quot; transaction).

===Message protocols===
I2C defines basic types of transactions, each of which begins with a START and ends with a STOP:
* Single message where a controller (master) writes data to a target (slave).
* Single message where a controller (master) reads data from a target (slave).
* Combined format, where a controller (master) issues at least two reads or writes to one or more targets (slaves).

In a combined transaction, each read or write begins with a START and the target address. The START conditions after the first are also called &quot;repeated START&quot; bits. Repeated STARTs are not preceded by STOP conditions, which is how targets know that the next message is part of the same transaction.

Any given target will only respond to certain messages, as specified in its product documentation.

Pure I2C systems support arbitrary message structures. SMBus is restricted to nine of those structures, such as &quot;read word N&quot; and &quot;write word N&quot;, involving a single target. PMBus extends SMBus with a &quot;Group&quot; protocol, allowing multiple such SMBus transactions to be sent in one combined message. The terminating STOP indicates when those grouped actions should take effect. For example, one PMBus operation might reconfigure three power supplies (using three different I2C target addresses), and their new configurations would take effect at the same time: when they receive that STOP.

With only a few exceptions, neither I2C nor SMBus define message semantics, such as the meaning of data bytes in messages. Message semantics are otherwise product-specific. Those exceptions include messages addressed to the I2C &quot;general call&quot; address (0x00) or to the SMBus &quot;Alert Response Address&quot;; and messages involved in the SMBus &quot;Address Resolution Protocol&quot; (ARP) for dynamic address allocation and management.

In practice, most targets adopt request-response control models, where one or more bytes following a write command are treated as a command or address. Those bytes determine how subsequent written bytes are treated or how the target responds on subsequent reads. Most SMBus operations involve single-byte commands.

===Messaging example: 24C32 EEPROM===

One specific example is the 24C32 type EEPROM, which uses two request bytes that are called Address High and Address Low. (Accordingly, these EEPROMs are not usable by pure SMBus hosts, which support only single-byte commands or addresses.) These bytes are used for addressing bytes within the 32 kbit (or 4 kB) EEPROM address space. The same two-byte addressing is also used by larger EEPROMs, like the 24C512 which stores 512 kbits (or 64 kB). Writing data to and reading from these EEPROMs uses a simple protocol: the address is written, and then data is transferred until the end of the message. The data transfer part of the protocol can cause trouble on the SMBus, since the data bytes are not preceded by a count, and more than 32 bytes can be transferred at once. I2C EEPROMs smaller than 32 kbit, like the 2 kbit 24C02, are often used on the SMBus with inefficient single-byte data transfers to overcome this problem.

A single message writes to the EEPROM. After the START, the controller sends the chip&#x27;s bus address with the direction bit clear (&quot;write&quot;), then sends the two-byte address of data within the EEPROM and then sends data bytes to be written starting at that address, followed by a STOP. When writing multiple bytes, all the bytes must be in the same 32-byte page. While it is busy saving those bytes to memory, the EEPROM will not respond to further I2C requests. (That is another incompatibility with SMBus: SMBus devices must always respond to their bus addresses.)

To read starting at a particular address in the EEPROM, a combined message is used. After a START, the controller first writes that chip&#x27;s bus address with the direction bit clear (&quot;write&quot;) and then the two bytes of EEPROM data address. It then sends a (repeated) START and the EEPROM&#x27;s bus address with the direction bit set (&quot;read&quot;). The EEPROM will then respond with the data bytes beginning at the specified EEPROM data address — a combined message: first a write, then a read. The controller issues an ACK after each read byte except the last byte, and then issues a STOP. The EEPROM increments the address after each data byte transferred; multi-byte reads can retrieve the entire contents of the EEPROM using one combined message.

===Physical layer===

At the physical layer, both SCL and SDA lines are an open-drain (MOSFET) or open-collector (BJT) bus design, thus a pull-up resistor is needed for each line. A logic &quot;0&quot; is output by pulling the line to ground, and a logic &quot;1&quot; is output by letting the line float (output high impedance) so that the pull-up resistor pulls it high. A line is never actively driven high. This wiring allows multiple nodes to connect to the bus without short circuits from signal contention. High-speed systems (and some others) may use a current source instead of a resistor to pull-up only SCL or both SCL and SDA, to accommodate higher bus capacitance and enable faster rise times.

An important consequence of this is that multiple nodes may be driving the lines simultaneously. If &quot;any&quot; node is driving the line low, it will be low. Nodes that are trying to transmit a logical one (i.e. letting the line float high) can detect this and conclude that another node is active at the same time.

When used on SCL, this is called &quot;clock stretching&quot; and is a flow-control mechanism for targets. When used on SDA, this is called arbitration and ensures that there is only one transmitter at a time.

When idle, both lines are high. To start a transaction, SDA is pulled low while SCL remains high. It is illegal to transmit a stop marker by releasing SDA to float high again (although such a &quot;void message&quot; is usually harmless), so the next step is to pull SCL low.

Except for the start and stop signals, the SDA line only changes while the clock is low; transmitting a data bit consists of pulsing the clock line high while holding the data line steady at the desired level.

While SCL is low, the transmitter (initially the controller) sets SDA to the desired value and (after a small delay to let the value propagate) lets SCL float high. The controller then waits for SCL to actually go high; this will be delayed by the finite rise time of the SCL signal (the RC time constant of the pull-up resistor and the parasitic capacitance of the bus) and may be additionally delayed by a target&#x27;s clock stretching.

Once SCL is high, the controller waits a minimum time (4 μs for standard-speed I2C) to ensure that the receiver has seen the bit, then pulls it low again. This completes transmission of one bit.

After every 8 data bits in one direction, an &quot;acknowledge&quot; bit is transmitted in the other direction. The transmitter and receiver switch roles for one bit, and the original receiver transmits a single &quot;0&quot; bit (ACK) back. If the transmitter sees a &quot;1&quot; bit (NACK) instead, it learns that:
* (If controller transmitting to target) The target is unable to accept the data. No such target, command not understood, or unable to accept any more data.
* (If target transmitting to controller) The controller wishes the transfer to stop after this data byte.
Only the SDA line changes direction during acknowledge bits; the SCL is always controlled by the controller.

After the acknowledge bit, the clock line is low and the controller may do one of three things:
* Begin transferring another byte of data: the transmitter sets SDA, and the controller pulses SCL high.
* Send a &quot;Stop&quot;: Set SDA low, let SCL go high, then let SDA go high. This releases the I2C bus.
* Send a &quot;Repeated start&quot;: Set SDA high, let SCL go high, then pull SDA low again. This starts a new I2C bus message without releasing the bus.

====Clock stretching using SCL====
One of the more significant features of the I2C protocol is clock stretching. An addressed target device may hold the clock line (SCL) low after receiving (or sending) a byte, indicating that it is not yet ready to process more data. The controller that is communicating with the target may not finish the transmission of the current bit, but must wait until the clock line actually goes high. If the target is clock-stretching, the clock line will still be low (because the connections are open-drain). The same is true if a second, slower, controller tries to drive the clock at the same time. (If there is more than one controller, all but one of them will normally lose arbitration.)

The controller must wait until it observes the clock line going high, and an additional minimal time (4 μs for standard I2C) before pulling the clock low again.

Although the controller may also hold the SCL line low for as long as it desires (this is not allowed since Rev. 6 of the protocol – subsection 3.1.1), the term &quot;clock stretching&quot; is normally used only when targets do it. Although in theory any clock pulse may be stretched, generally it is the intervals before or after the acknowledgment bit which are used. For example, if the target is a microcontroller, its I2C interface could stretch the clock after each byte, until the software decides whether to send a positive acknowledgment or a NACK.

Clock stretching is the only time in I2C where the target drives SCL. Many targets do not need to clock stretch and thus treat SCL as strictly an input with no circuitry to drive it. Some controllers, such as those found inside custom ASICs may not support clock stretching; often these devices will be labeled as a &quot;two-wire interface&quot; and not I2C.

To maximize bus throughput, SMBus places limits on how far clocks may be stretched. Hosts and targets adhering to those limits cannot block access to the bus for more than a short time, which is not a guarantee made by pure I2C systems.

====Arbitration using SDA====
Every controller monitors the bus for start and stop bits and does not start a message while another controller is keeping the bus busy. However, two controllers may start transmission at about the same time; in this case, arbitration occurs. Target transmit mode can also be arbitrated, when a controller addresses multiple targets, but this is less common. In contrast to protocols (such as Ethernet) that use random back-off delays before issuing a retry, I2C has a deterministic arbitration policy. Each transmitter checks the level of the data line (SDA) and compares it with the levels it expects; if they do not match, that transmitter has lost arbitration and drops out of this protocol interaction.

If one transmitter sets SDA to 1 (not driving a signal) and a second transmitter sets it to 0 (pull to ground), the result is that the line is low. The first transmitter then observes that the level of the line is different from that expected and concludes that another node is transmitting. The first node to notice such a difference is the one that loses arbitration: it stops driving SDA. If it is a controller, it also stops driving SCL and waits for a STOP; then it may try to reissue its entire message. In the meantime, the other node has not noticed any difference between the expected and actual levels on SDA and therefore continues transmission. It can do so without problems because so far the signal has been exactly as it expected; no other transmitter has disturbed its message.

If the two controllers are sending a message to two different targets, the one sending the lower target address always &quot;wins&quot; arbitration in the address stage. Since the two controllers may send messages to the same target address, and addresses sometimes refer to multiple targets, arbitration must sometimes continue into the data stages.

Arbitration occurs very rarely, but is necessary for proper multi-controller support. As with clock stretching, not all devices support arbitration. Those that do, generally label themselves as supporting &quot;multi-controller&quot; communication.

One case which must be handled carefully in multi-controller I2C implementations is that of the controllers talking to each other. One controller may lose arbitration to an incoming message, and must change its role from controller to target in time to acknowledge its own address.

In the extremely rare case that two controllers simultaneously send identical messages, both will regard the communication as successful, but the target will only see one message. For this reason, when a target can be accessed by multiple controllers, every command recognized by the target either must be idempotent or must be guaranteed never to be issued by two controllers at the same time. (For example, a command which is issued by only one controller need not be idempotent, nor is it necessary for a specific command to be idempotent when some mutual exclusion mechanism ensures that only one controller can be caused to issue that command at any given time.)

====Arbitration in SMBus====
While I2C only arbitrates between controllers, SMBus uses arbitration in three additional contexts, where multiple targets respond to the controller, and one gets its message through.
* Although conceptually a single-controller bus, a target device that supports the &quot;host notify protocol&quot; acts as a controller to perform the notification. It seizes the bus and writes a 3-byte message to the reserved &quot;SMBus Host&quot; address (0x08), passing its address and two bytes of data. When two targets try to notify the host at the same time, one of them will lose arbitration and need to retry.
* An alternative target notification system uses the separate SMBALERT# signal to request attention. In this case, the host performs a 1-byte read from the reserved &quot;SMBus Alert Response Address&quot; (0x0C), which is a kind of broadcast address. All alerting targets respond with a data bytes containing their own address. When the target successfully transmits its own address (winning arbitration against others) it stops raising that interrupt. In both this and the preceding case, arbitration ensures that one target&#x27;s message will be received, and the others will know they must retry.
* SMBus also supports an &quot;address resolution protocol&quot;, wherein devices return a 16-byte &quot;Unique Device Identifier&quot; (UDID). Multiple devices may respond; the one with the lowest UDID will win arbitration and be recognized.

====Arbitration in PMBus====
PMBus version 1.3 extends the SMBus alert response protocol in its &quot;zone read&quot; protocol. Targets may be grouped into &quot;zones&quot;, and all targets in a zone may be addressed to respond, with their responses masked (omitting unwanted information), inverted (so wanted information is sent as 0 bits, which win arbitration), or reordered (so the most significant information is sent first). Arbitration ensures that the highest priority response is the one first returned to the controller.

PMBus reserves I2C addresses 0x28 and 0x37 for zone reads and writes, respectively.

===Differences between modes===
There are several possible operating modes for I2C communication. All are compatible in that the &quot;standard mode&quot; may always be used, but combining devices of different capabilities on the same bus can cause issues, as follows:
* &quot;Fast mode&quot; is highly compatible and simply tightens several of the timing parameters to achieve speed. &quot;Fast mode&quot; is widely supported by I2C target devices, so a controller may use it as long as it knows that the bus capacitance and pull-up strength allow it.
* &quot;Fast mode plus&quot; achieves up to using more powerful (20 mA) drivers and pull-ups to achieve faster rise and fall times. Compatibility with &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;fast mode&quot; devices (with 3 mA pull-down capability) can be achieved if there is some way to reduce the strength of the pull-ups when talking to them.
* &quot;High speed mode&quot; () is compatible with normal I2C devices on the same bus, but requires the controller have an active pull-up on the clock line which is enabled during high speed transfers. The first data bit is transferred with a normal open-drain rising clock edge, which may be stretched. For the remaining seven data bits, and the ACK, the controller drives the clock high at the appropriate time and the target may not stretch it. All high-speed transfers are preceded by a single-byte &quot;controller code&quot; at fast or standard speed. This code serves three purposes:
*# it tells high-speed target devices to change to high-speed timing rules,
*# it ensures that fast or normal speed devices will not try to participate in the transfer (because it does not match their address), and
*# because it identifies the controller (there are eight controller codes, and each controller must use a different one), it ensures that arbitration is complete before the high-speed portion of the transfer, and so the high-speed portion need not make allowances for that ability.
* &quot;Ultra-Fast mode&quot; is essentially a write-only I2C subset, which is incompatible with other modes except in that it is easy to add support for it to an existing I2C interface hardware design. Only one controller is permitted, and it actively drives data lines at all times to achieve a transfer rate. Clock stretching, arbitration, read transfers, and acknowledgements are all omitted. It is mainly intended for animated LED displays where a transmission error would only cause an inconsequential brief visual glitch. The resemblance to other I2C bus modes is limited to:
** the start and stop conditions are used to delimit transfers,
** I2C addressing allows multiple target devices to share the bus without SPI bus style target select signals, and
** a ninth clock pulse is sent per byte transmitted marking the position of the unused acknowledgement bits.

Some of the vendors provide a so-called non-standard &quot;Turbo mode&quot; with a speed up to .

In all modes, the clock frequency is controlled by the controller(s), and a longer-than-normal bus may be operated at a slower-than-nominal speed by underclocking.

===Circuit interconnections===

I2C is popular for interfacing peripheral circuits to prototyping systems, such as the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I2C does not employ a standardized connector, however, board designers have created various wiring schemes for I2C interconnections. To minimize the possible damage due to plugging 0.1-inch headers in backwards, some developers have suggested using alternating signal and power connections of the following wiring schemes: (GND, SCL, VCC, SDA) or (VCC, SDA, GND, SCL).

The vast majority of applications use I2C in the way it was originally designed—peripheral ICs directly wired to a processor on the same printed circuit board, and therefore over relatively short distances of less than , without a connector. However using a differential driver, an alternate version of I2C can communicate up to 20 meters (possibly over 100 meters) over CAT5 or other cable.

Several standard connectors carry I2C signals. For example, the UEXT connector carries I2C;
the 10-pin iPack connector carries I2C; the 6P6C Lego Mindstorms NXT connector carries I2C; a few people use the 8P8C connectors and CAT5 cable normally used for Ethernet physical layer to instead carry differential-encoded I2C signals or boosted single-ended I2C signals; and every HDMI and most DVI and VGA connectors carry DDC2 data over I2C.

===Buffering and multiplexing===
When there are many I2C devices in a system, there can be a need to include bus buffers or multiplexers to split large bus segments into smaller ones. This can be necessary to keep the capacitance of a bus segment below the allowable value or to allow multiple devices with the same address to be separated by a multiplexer. Many types of multiplexers and buffers exist and all must take into account the fact that I2C lines are specified to be bidirectional. Multiplexers can be implemented with analog switches, which can tie one segment to another. Analog switches maintain the bidirectional nature of the lines but do not isolate the capacitance of one segment from another or provide buffering capability.

Buffers can be used to isolate capacitance on one segment from another and/or allow I2C to be sent over longer cables or traces. Buffers for bi-directional lines such as I2C must use one of several schemes for preventing latch-up. I2C is open-drain, so buffers must drive a low on one side when they see a low on the other. One method for preventing latch-up is for a buffer to have carefully selected input and output levels such that the output level of its driver is higher than its input threshold, preventing it from triggering itself. For example, a buffer may have an input threshold of 0.4 V for detecting a low, but an output low level of 0.5 V. This method requires that all other devices on the bus have thresholds which are compatible and often means that multiple buffers implementing this scheme cannot be put in series with one another.

Alternatively, other types of buffers exist that implement current amplifiers or keep track of the state (i.e. which side drove the bus low) to prevent latch-up. The state method typically means that an unintended pulse is created during a hand-off when one side is driving the bus low, then the other drives it low, then the first side releases (this is common during an I2C acknowledgement).

===Sharing SCL between multiple buses===
When having a single controller, it is possible to have multiple I2C buses share the same SCL line. The packets on each bus are either sent one after the other or at the same time. This is possible, because the communication on each bus can be subdivided in alternating short periods with high SCL followed by short periods with low SCL. And the clock can be stretched, if one bus needs more time in one state.

Advantages are using targets devices with the same address at the same time and saving connections or a faster throughput by using several data lines at the same time.

=== Line state table ===
These tables show the various atomic states and bit operations that may occur during an I2C message.


=== Addressing structure ===

==== 7-bit addressing ====
==== 10-bit addressing ====
=== Reserved addresses in 7-bit address space ===
Two groups of 8 addresses each are reserved for special functions:
* From: codice_1 to codice_2
* From: codice_3 to codice_4
In addition, the remaining 112 addresses are designated for specific classes of device, and some of them are further reserved by either related standards or common usage.

SMBus reserves some additional addresses. In particular, codice_5 is reserved for the SMBus host, which may be used by controller-capable devices, codice_6 is the &quot;SMBus alert response address&quot; which is polled by the host after an out-of-band interrupt, and codice_7 is the default address which is initially used by devices capable of dynamic address assignment.

=== Non-reserved addresses in 7-bit address space ===

Although MSB codice_8 is reserved for Device ID and 10-bit target (slave) addressing, it is also used by VESA DDC display dependent devices such as pointing devices.

=== Transaction format ===
An I2C &quot;transaction&quot; consists of one or more &quot;messages&quot;. Each message begins with a start symbol, and the transaction ends with a stop symbol. Start symbols after the first, which begin a message but not a transaction, are referred to as &quot;repeated start&quot; symbols.

Each message is a read or a write. A transaction consisting of a single message is called either a read or a write transaction. A transaction consisting of multiple messages is called a combined transaction. The most common form of the latter is a write message providing intra-device address information, followed by a read message.

Many I2C devices do not distinguish between a combined transaction and the same messages sent as separate transactions, but not all. The device ID protocol requires a single transaction; targets are forbidden from responding if they observe a stop symbol. Configuration, calibration or self-test modes which cause the target to respond unusually are also often automatically terminated at the end of a transaction.

===Timing diagram===
# Data transfer is initiated with a &quot;start&quot; condition (S) signalled by SDA being pulled low while SCL stays high.
# SCL is pulled low, and SDA sets the first data bit level while keeping SCL low (during blue bar time).
# The data is sampled (received) when SCL rises for the first bit (B1). For a bit to be valid, SDA must not change between a rising edge of SCL and the subsequent falling edge (the entire green bar time).
# This process repeats, SDA transitioning while SCL is low, and the data being read while SCL is high (B2 through Bn).
# The final bit is followed by a clock pulse, during which SDA is pulled low in preparation for the &quot;stop&quot; bit.
# A &quot;stop&quot; condition (P) is signalled when SCL rises, followed by SDA rising.

To avoid false marker detection, there is a minimum delay between the SCL falling edge and changing SDA, and between changing SDA and the SCL rising edge. The minimum delay time is dependent upon the data transfer rate in use. Note that an I2C message containing data bits (including acknowledgements) contains clock pulses.

===Software Design===
I2C lends itself to a &quot;bus driver&quot; software design. Software for attached devices is written to call a &quot;bus driver&quot; that handles the actual low-level I2C hardware. This permits the driver code for attached devices to port easily to other hardware, including a bit-banging design.

===Example of bit-banging the I2C protocol===
Below is an example of bit-banging the I2C protocol as an I2C controller (master). The example is written in pseudo C. It illustrates all of the I2C features described before (clock stretching, arbitration, start/stop bit, ack/nack).

== Operating system support ==
* In AmigaOS one can use the i2c.resource component for AmigaOS 4.x and MorphOS 3.x or the shared library &quot;i2c.library&quot; by Wilhelm Noeker for older systems.
* Arduino developers can use the &quot;Wire&quot; library.
* CircuitPython and MicroPython developers can use the busio.I2C or machine.I2C classes respectively.
* Maximite supports I2C communications natively as part of its MMBasic.
* PICAXE uses the i2c and hi2c commands.
* eCos supports I2C for several hardware architectures.
* ChibiOS/RT supports I2C for several hardware architectures.
* FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD also provide an I2C framework, with support for a number of common controllers and sensors.
** Since OpenBSD 3.9 (released ), a central subsystem probes all possible sensor chips at once during boot, using an ad hoc weighting scheme and a local caching function for reading register values from the I2C targets; this makes it possible to probe sensors on general-purpose off-the-shelf i386/amd64 hardware during boot without any configuration by the user nor a noticeable probing delay; the matching procedures of the individual drivers then only has to rely on a string-based &quot;friendly-name&quot; for matching; as a result, most I2C sensor drivers are automatically enabled by default in applicable architectures without ill effects on stability; individual sensors, both I2C and otherwise, are exported to the userland through the sysctl hw.sensors framework. , OpenBSD has over two dozen device drivers on I2C that export some kind of a sensor through the hw.sensors framework, and the majority of these drivers are fully enabled by default in i386/amd64 codice_9 kernels of OpenBSD.
** In NetBSD, over two dozen I2C target devices exist that feature hardware monitoring sensors, which are accessible through the sysmon envsys framework as property lists. On general-purpose hardware, each driver has to do its own probing, hence all drivers for the I2C targets are disabled by default in NetBSD in codice_9 i386/amd64 builds.
* In Linux, I2C is handled with a device driver for the specific device, and another for the I2C (or SMBus) adapter to which it is connected. Hundreds of such drivers are part of current Linux kernel releases.
* In Mac OS X, there are about two dozen I2C kernel extensions that communicate with sensors for reading voltage, current, temperature, motion, and other physical status.
* In Microsoft Windows, I2C is implemented by the respective device drivers of much of the industry&#x27;s available hardware. For HID embedded/SoC devices, Windows 8 and later have an integrated I²C bus driver.
* In Windows CE, I2C is implemented by the respective device drivers of much of the industry&#x27;s available hardware.
* Unison OS, a POSIX RTOS for IoT, supports I2C for several MCU and MPU hardware architectures.
* In RISC OS, I2C is provided with a generic I2C interface from the IO controller and supported from the OS module system
* In Sinclair QDOS and Minerva QL operating systems I2C is supported by a set of extensions provided by TF Services.
* In Zephyr OS, I2C is supported through the i2c device driver API. This API provides a generic interface for communicating with I2C devices, allowing for a wide range of I2C devices to be supported.

==Development tools==
When developing or troubleshooting systems using I2C, visibility at the level of hardware signals can be important.

=== Host adapters ===
There are a number of I2C host adapter hardware solutions for making a I2C controller or target connection to host computers, running Linux, Mac or Windows. Most options are USB-to-I2C adapters. Not all of them require proprietary drivers or APIs.

=== Protocol analyzers ===
I2C protocol analyzers are tools that sample an I2C bus and decode the electrical signals to provide a higher-level view of the data being transmitted on the bus.

=== Logic analyzers ===
When developing and/or troubleshooting the I2C bus, examination of hardware signals can be very important. Logic analyzers are tools that collect, analyze, decode, and store signals, so people can view the high-speed waveforms at their leisure. Logic analyzers display time stamps of each signal level change, which can help find protocol problems. Most logic analyzers have the capability to decode bus signals into high-level protocol data and show ASCII data.

== Limitations ==
The assignment of target addresses is a weakness of I2C. Seven bits is too few to prevent address collisions between the many thousands of available devices. What alleviates the issue of address collisions between different vendors and also allows to connect to several identical devices is that manufacturers dedicate pins that can be used to set the target address to one of a few address options per device. Two or three pins is typical, and with many devices, there are three or more wiring options per address pin.

10-bit I2C addresses are not yet widely used, and many host operating systems do not support them. Neither is the complex SMBus &quot;ARP&quot; scheme for dynamically assigning addresses (other than for PCI cards with SMBus presence, for which it is required).

Automatic bus configuration is a related issue. A given address may be used by a number of different protocol-incompatible devices in various systems, and hardly any device types can be detected at runtime. For example, codice_11 may be used by a 24LC02 or 24C32 EEPROM, with incompatible addressing; or by a PCF8563 RTC, which cannot reliably be distinguished from either (without changing device state, which might not be allowed). The only reliable configuration mechanisms available to hosts involve out-of-band mechanisms such as tables provided by system firmware, which list the available devices. Again, this issue can partially be addressed by ARP in SMBus systems, especially when vendor and product identifiers are used; but that has not really caught on. The Rev. 3 version of the I2C specification adds a device ID mechanism.

I2C supports a limited range of speeds. Hosts supporting the multi-megabit speeds are rare. Support for the Fm+ speed is more widespread, since its electronics are simple variants of what is used at lower speeds. Many devices do not support the speed (in part because SMBus does not yet support it). I2C nodes implemented in software (instead of dedicated hardware) may not even support the speed; so the whole range defined in the specification is rarely usable. All devices must at least partially support the highest speed used or they may spuriously detect their device address.

Devices are allowed to stretch clock cycles to suit their particular needs, which can starve bandwidth needed by faster devices and increase latencies when talking to other device addresses. Bus capacitance also places a limit on the transfer speed, especially when current sources are not used to decrease signal rise times.

Because I2C is a shared bus, there is the potential for any device to have a fault and hang the entire bus. For example, if any device holds the SDA or SCL line low, it prevents the controller from sending START or STOP commands to reset the bus. Thus it is common for designs to include a reset signal that provides an external method of resetting the bus devices. However many devices do not have a dedicated reset pin, forcing the designer to put in circuitry to allow devices to be power-cycled if they need to be reset.

Because of these limits (address management, bus configuration, potential faults, speed), few I2C bus segments have even a dozen devices. Instead, it is common for systems to have several smaller segments. One might be dedicated to use with high-speed devices, for low-latency power management. Another might be used to control a few devices where latency and throughput are not important issues; yet another segment might be used only to read EEPROM chips describing add-on cards (such as the SPD standard used with DRAM sticks).

On very low-power systems, the pull-up resistors can use more power than the entire rest of the design combined. On these, the resistors are often powered by a switchable voltage source, such as a DIO from a microcontroller. The pull-ups also limit the speed of the bus and have a small additional cost. Therefore, some designers are turning to other serial buses that do not need pull-ups, such as I3C or SPI.

==Derivative technologies==
I2C is the basis for the ACCESS.bus, the VESA Display Data Channel (DDC) interface, the System Management Bus (SMBus), Power Management Bus (PMBus) and the Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB, one of the protocols of IPMI). These variants have differences in voltage and clock frequency ranges, and may have interrupt lines.

High-availability systems (AdvancedTCA, MicroTCA) use 2-way redundant I2C for shelf management. Multi-controller I2C capability is a requirement in these systems.

TWI (Two-Wire Interface) or TWSI (Two-Wire Serial Interface) is essentially the same bus implemented on various system-on-chip processors from Atmel and other vendors. Vendors use the name TWI, even though I2C is not a registered trademark as of 2014-11-07. Trademark protection only exists for the respective logo (see upper right corner), and patents on I2C have now lapsed. According to Microchip Technology, TWI and I2C have a few differences. One of them is that TWI does not support START byte.

In some cases, use of the term &quot;two-wire interface&quot; indicates incomplete implementation of the I2C specification. Not supporting arbitration or clock stretching is one common limitation, which is still useful for a single controller communicating with simple targets that never stretch the clock.

MIPI I3C sensor interface standard (I3C) is a development of I2C, under development in 2017.

<text>Heber City is a city and county seat of Wasatch County, Utah. The population was 16,856 as of the 2020 United States census. The city is located 43 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.

==History==
Heber City was first settled in 1859 by Robert Broadhead, James Davis, and James Gurr. John W. Witt built the first house in the area. The area was under the direction of Bishop Silas Smith, who was in Provo. In 1860, Joseph S. Murdock became the bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Heber City and its vicinity.

On May 5, 1899, the Wasatch Wave published this on the 40-year anniversary of Heber. &quot;Forty years ago this week [April 30, 1859], this valley was first settled by a company of enterprising citizens from Provo. This company consisted of John Crook, James Carlile, Jessie Bond, Henry Chatwin, Charles N. Carroll, Thomas Rasband, John Jordan, John Carlile, Wm. Giles and Mr. Carpenter, the last five named persons having since died. Forty years ago today, John Crook and Thomas Rasband commenced their first plowing in the beautiful little valley of the Timpanogos. A wonderful change has taken place in the appearance of the valley since that time. Delightful meadows and fields of waving grain have taken the place of sage brush and willows. Beautiful homes have erected where then was heard only the dismal howl of the coyote.&quot;
During the second world war, a group of Japanese-Americans formed a voluntary relocation camp in nearby Keetley. Some Japanese-Americans also stayed in Heber City.

==Geography==
The region in which Heber City is located is known as the Wasatch Back.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.5 square miles (8.9 km2), all land.

Heber City is located near three large reservoirs, Jordanelle, Deer Creek, and Strawberry.

===Climate===
Large seasonal temperature differences typify this climatic region, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Heber City has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated ‘’Dfb’’ on climate maps.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 11,362 people and 3,637 households residing in the city. The population density was 2,113.5 people per square mile (/km2). There were 3,637 housing units at an average density of 710.5 per square mile (/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 87.7% White, 0.4% African American, 0.8% Native American, 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 18.4% of the population.

There were 3,362 households, out of which 50.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.6% were non-families. Of all households, 15.9% were individuals, and 6.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years or older. The average household size was 3.35, and the average family size was 3.78. The median age was 28.5 years.

The median income for a household in the city was $45,394, and the median income for a family was $47,481. Males had a median income of $33,816 versus $21,524 for females. The per capita income was $17,358. About 4.8% of families and 6.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.7% of those under age 18 and 1.9% of those age 65 or older.

==Economy==
Heber City has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Utah. Local developers and business leaders cite that there are not enough jobs in the city itself (as 27% of residents commute to Park City or Salt Lake City for work) and wish to improve the city&#x27;s self-reliance. Average home prices in the valley doubled from 2002 to 2008, and the population has grown by 25% in that same time period.

Tourism is a year-round industry in the Heber Valley. The winter season features cross-country and downhill skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling on several trails and the nearby ski resorts of Park City. In the summer and fall, golfing, off-roading, hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities are abundant. Heber is also home to the Heber Valley Historic Railroad (HVRR), known to Utah residents by its&#x27; nickname, the Heber Creeper.

Heber City&#x27;s youth are employed largely in the surrounding golf courses, restaurants, and specialty shops in Heber City and the surrounding area. Local contractors and farmers are also a major source of employment for the youth. The adult population work mostly in Park City, Salt Lake City, Provo, and Orem. Skiing and Snowboarding are very popular among Heber City&#x27;s youth, and many people go to Park City mountain resort, Canyons, or Deer Valley, all of which are in Park City. Farming and ranching are a large economic force, but this has diminished slightly. The largest local employer is the Wasatch County School District.

==Education==
Within the city limits are Heber Valley, Old Mill, Daniels Canyon, and J.R. Smith Elementary Schools, Timpanogos Middle School, Rocky Mountain Middle School, Wasatch High School, and Wasatch Alternative High School. An additional school in the Heber Valley is Midway Elementary School. All of these schools are part of the Wasatch County School District.

Utah Valley University maintains a satellite campus just north of Heber City along the US-40 corridor.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 189 both cross the city. Interstate 80 is located approximately eighteen miles north of the city and can be accessed via Highway 40, while Interstate 15 can be accessed via Highway 189 through Provo Canyon and is approximately twenty-five miles away. A typical drive to downtown Salt Lake City is 45 to 60 minutes.

Heber City was connected to Provo by a railroad line. The line, completed in 1899, was used by Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western until 1967. Today, a portion of the line is used by the famous Heber Valley Railroad, a heritage railroad open to the public.

The Heber City Municipal Airport, or Russ McDonald Field, FAA identifier HCR, is located two miles south of the city, near the junction of U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 189, and is capable of handling aircraft up to large corporate jets, including Gulfstreams and Global Express. Approximately 85 aircraft are based at the airport. The airport is served by a GPS instrument approach procedure, allowing aircraft to arrive at the airport in adverse weather. During the winter ski season, and particularly the Sundance Film Festival, the airport is crowded with corporate jets as it is the closest airport to Park City. The airport is also home to the Heber Valley Airshow, held each summer. The nearest airports with commercial airline service are Provo Municipal Airport (35 miles) and Salt Lake City International Airport (49 miles).

High Valley Transit provides free local transit in Heber City, with the 106 providing service to Park City, where connections are available to Kamas Valley, Kimball Junction and Salt Lake City. There is also a microtransit zone within Heber City. 

Intercity transportation is provided by two round-trips operated by Salt Lake Express on its Vernal - Salt Lake City route.

<text>Midway is a city in northwestern Wasatch County, Utah, United States. It is located in the Heber Valley, approximately west of Heber City and southeast of Salt Lake City, on the opposite side of the Wasatch Mountains. The population was 6,003 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first known European-Americans to visit the area were members of a fur-trapping brigade led by Étienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, in 1824. This expedition explored the region, which was then known as Upper Provo, a name derived from the Provo River that flows through the valley. While these early visitors did not establish permanent settlements, their journey marked the beginning of exploration in the area.

In the mid-1850s, settlers began to push into the Heber Valley, encouraged by reports from loggers in the nearby mountains who noted the fertile land. Settlers of Utah Valley pushed the territorial government to create a road up the Provo Canyon, a proposal favored by territorial governor Brigham Young. In 1858, the construction of a road through Provo Canyon provided easier access to the valley, allowing for further settlement. Despite early attempts in 1855 and 1857, harsh winters forced settlers to temporarily abandon the area. Permanent settlement was only achieved in 1858-59, when settlers established several small communities in the valley, two of which were west of the Provo River. These were known as the &quot;upper settlement&quot; and &quot;lower settlement&quot; on the Snake Creek River. The upper settlement was also called Mound City, named for the nearby limestone formations.

In the 1860s, the upper and lower settlement merged to become Midway, so named because it was the site of Fort Midway, halfway between the two. Though local history claims Midway&#x27;s creation was prompted by the Black Hawk War, a post office named Midway was in operation at least as early as 1864, before the Black Hawk War began. The site of Fort Midway is now the town square.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.7 km2), all land. The region in which Midway sits is known as the Wasatch Back. Midway is bisected from north to south by Snake Creek, which includes the Midway Fish Hatchery just before the creek joins the middle section of the Provo River above Deer Creek Reservoir.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Midway has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

===Geology===
The Wasatch Fault runs underneath Midway, including the main fault line west of the town and the Bald Mountain Fault, which runs through the valley as well. Fault activity is responsible for some of the formations in the mountains around Midway, as well as the characteristic limestone (&quot;potrock&quot;) mounds and the prevalence of hot springs in the area.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 census Midway had a population of 3,845. The ethnic and racial makeup of the population was 92.6% non-Hispanic White, 0.2% African-American, 0.5% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.9% reporting two or more races and 5.5% Hispanic.

The median income for a household in the city was $51,071, and the median income for a family was $55,809. Males had a median income of $40,870 versus $25,682 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,551. About 3.4% of families and 5.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.4% of those under age 18 and 4.9% of those age 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==
Midway&#x27;s architecture is notable for its Swiss influence, and some subdivisions require new houses to include a certain percentage of Swiss features. Architect John Watkins lived in Midway, and several of his works remain extant, including the Watkins–Coleman House. The John H. and Agnes Buehler House, built in 1893, is known as the &quot;Hobbit house&quot; or &quot;mushroom house&quot;.

Midway Swiss Days was founded in 1947 in order to attract crowds to Midway. The Swiss theme was created by Orma W. Wallengren, whose family owned a local resort.

Artistic events include Art Around the Square, and the Midway Arts Center.

Soldier Hollow features the Utah Ice Castles, cross-country skiing, and a tubing hill.

==Parks and recreation==
Wasatch Mountain State Park on Snake Creek is located in north Midway.

Homestead caldera is a resort with a geo-thermal pool that features year-round scuba diving in the caldera&#x27;s warm water.

==Government==
Midway is governed by a five-person city council. The members of the city council as of December 2024 are Lisa Orme, Craig Simons, Jeff Drury, Kevin Payne, and JC Simonsen.

==Media==
In the film &quot;127 Hours&quot;, the scene where Ralston and two girls drop into a hidden pool was filmed at Homestead caldera at the Homestead Resort.

A post office called Enterprise has been in operation since 1899. It was settled largely by residents of the town of Hebron, later abandoned. The town was so named for the settlers&#x27; enterprising plan to find a water supply. Cattle ranchers thrived in the area, but the town needed a consistent water supply to sustain themselves and for agriculture to spread. The settlers decided to take on the ambitious project of constructing a dam. Many thought that the dam would be impossible to accomplish and left the area. The rest of the settlers began work on the dam. With a lot of work and little return, the dam was completed, and the reservoir has supported the town ever since.

<doc id="137184" wikidata="Q483016" url="?curid=137184" title="Hildale, Utah">
<text>Hildale is a city in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,127 at the 2020 census.

Hildale is located on the border of Utah and Arizona.

==History==
Hildale, formerly known as Short Creek Community, was founded in 1913 by members of the Council of Friends, a breakaway group from the Salt Lake City–based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Hildale and its border city of Colorado City, Arizona, have an interwoven history with their shared claims of &quot;Short Creek.&quot;

=== Early years ===
In 1914 a small school was built, followed by a post office. Much of Hildale&#x27;s history is wrapped up in its association with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), and two additional polygamist breakoffs. Throughout the majority of its history, community members faced scrutiny and government intervention. In 1953 Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle ordered a raid of the surrounding community which lead to many arrests. The following year, the Utah government attempted the same. The two events are collectively known as The Short Creek raids. Utah continued its enforcement by separating children from Families, starting with the family of Vera Black.

The FLDS church&#x27;s private trust, which evolved into a charitable trust, was the United Effort Plan. A major component of that trust included members of the church &quot;consecrating&quot;, or donating, their property to the trust, with the understanding it would be put to its best use. Because of this practice, and increasing wealth that the trust purchased property, a vast majority of the real property in Hildale was controlled by single legal entity which wielded quite a bit of power, and influenced land-use decisions. The majority of the area was developed as very low-density, with large homes to accommodate complex family structures, and a great deal of agricultural land. After the trust&#x27;s control was taken by Utah in 2005, then transitioned back to a board, the large square footage homes that originally housed multiple families, has complicated the homes being transitioned back for private use.

Hildale eventually incorporated as a town in 1963, and a city in 1990.

=== Warren Jeffs controversy ===

In January 2004 Warren Jeffs, the Prophet of the FLDS church and a major community leader, consolidated power within the UEP, and the church. This included the excommunication of many male members of the faith group, who were then expected to leave the community immediately, since their land and homes were operated by the Trust. While this practice had affected the city in small numbers before, this singular event led to increased attention to the community, and scrutiny of the Trust&#x27;s control. When Jeffs was later accused of federal crimes in 2005, and became a fugitive, the Utah attorney general&#x27;s office temporarily seized control of the assets of the Trust (which also included land in Arizona, Texas, British Columbia and elsewhere.)

On April 6, 2010, Arizona officials executed search warrants at governmental offices of the towns of Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah. According to one report, the warrants involved the misuse of funds and caused the Hildale Public Safety Department to be shut down. According to another report, city personnel and volunteers were ordered out of the buildings while the search was being conducted, prompting protests from Colorado City Fire Chief Jake Barlow. Then in June 2014, the Arizona Office of the Attorney General filed a motion in U.S. District Court seeking to dissolve the local police forces and &quot;the disbandment of the Colorado City, Arizona/Hildale, Utah Marshal&#x27;s Office and the appointment of a federal monitor over municipal functions and services.&quot; As the basis for the legal proceeding, the Arizona Attorney General stated that &quot;[t]he disbandment of the Colorado City/Hildale Marshal&#x27;s Office is necessary and appropriate because this police department has operated for decades, and continues to operate, as the de facto law enforcement arm of the FLDS Church.&quot;

=== Flash flood ===
During a flash flood on September 14, 2015, at least 12 members of two related families from the community were killed while stopped in a low water crossing at the mouth of Maxwell Canyon in Hildale. A thirteenth person was still missing as of March 16, 2021. The flooding resulted from the moisture from Hurricane Linda.

=== Religious discrimination charges ===
In 2016, in &quot;United States V. Town of Colorado City Arizona&quot;, of which Hildale was also a defendant, the jury found that both cities, and associated corporations had violated various provisions of the Policing Act, The Fair Housing Act, and had multiple violations of discrimination against people who were not in good favor of the FLDS church, and its leaders.
=== Post-Warren Jeffs leadership ===
The Hildale land held by the UEP, under government oversight, was being offered to beneficiaries who could prove they had possessed the land, or otherwise had valid claims to it. Distrust of government officials left much of the land unclaimed. People who had left the FLDS church in previous decades, including some &quot;lost boys,&quot; began returning to accept these claims which has led to a major population shift.

In 2017, Donia Jessop who had left the church and returned just the year before to Hildale, ran successfully for mayor. This was the first time in the community&#x27;s history that both a woman had been elected, and the first time a non-member of the FLDS faith had been elected. The election received major pushback, with the current serving government initially locking her out of the offices and refusing her entry. 15 employees and board members would go on to resign before she was sworn in, refusing to work with her. In 2018, on the day of her swearing in, in an act of protest, all the remaining city council members who were within the FLDS church resigned. Combined with the few newly sworn in City council members who were not FLDS, the result was a new mayor with a completely replaced city council following special elections to fill the vacated seats.

While the population decreased significantly between 2010 and 2015, since this transition of leadership, efforts have been made to both welcome and provide resources to people who leave the faith, but also invite all who have moved away to return to the community. This has included working alongside Colorado City leaders, who have made similar efforts to make their community more open to outsiders, including a large branch of Mohave Community college, and the opening of the communities&#x27; first bars.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hildale has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
===2000 census===
As of the 2000 census, there were 1,895 people, 232 households, and 215 families residing in the city. The population density was 644.2 per square mile (248.9/km2). There were 243 housing units at an average density of 82.6 per square mile (31.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 96.41% White, 0.21% African American, 0.47% Native American, 0.63% Asian, 0.63% Pacific Islander, 0.84% from other races, and 0.79% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.00% of the population.

There were 232 households, out of which 76.7% had children under 18 living with them, 82.3% were married couples living together, 8.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 6.9% were non-families. 6.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 8.17, and the average family size was 8.10.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 63.6% under 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 18.4% from 25 to 44, 6.3% from 45 to 64, and 2.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 13 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.2 males. For every 100 females aged 18 and over, there were 75.8 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $32,679, and the median income for a family was $31,750. Males had a median income of $25,170 versus $16,071 for females. The per capita income for the city was $4,782. About 37.0% of families and 41.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 42.0% of those under age 18 and 31.8% of those aged 65 or over.

==Government==
In January 2018, the city&#x27;s first female mayor, Donia Jessop, was sworn in along with a new city council. This also marked the first time positions in city government have been held by people who are not members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. About a month afterward, 11 city employees resigned, at least one of whom said that his religion prevented him from &quot;following a woman, and from serving on a board with apostates.&quot;

The town is policed by the Colorado City/Hilldale Police Department.

==Education==
Hildale is within the Washington County School District.

The earliest school, when the city was founded in 1914 was across the border, funded by Mohave County, Arizona. Various schools were built and used, by 1998, the city&#x27;s elementary-age students attended the Phelps School in Hildale while many older students attended school in Colorado City Unified School District in Arizona. In early 2000, local religious leaders encouraged families to withdraw their children from public schools, with over a thousand students transitioning to homeschool across all grades, similarly, the schools saw major teacher resignations which effectively led to their closures. Utah contracted with Arizona for remaining public school students to attend schools across the border.

In 2014 Washington County School District purchased the old Phelps Elementary Building and a building next to it. After a quick remodel, the old Phelps Elementary School was reopened as Water Canyon School, which originally served K-12. Two years later, the building next to Phelps was completed, and opened as Water Canyon High School. The completion of the high school allowed Water Canyon School to become K-8. By 2020 Enrollment had increased significantly and the school expanded with a new Career and technical education building and athletic facilities. In 2021, Utah Tech University opened an extension campus within the high school.

<doc id="137185" wikidata="Q482646" url="?curid=137185" title="Hurricane, Utah">
<text>Hurricane ( ) is a city in Washington County, Utah, United States. Its population was 20,036 as of the 2020 United States Census estimates. The Hurricane valley makes up the easternmost part of the St. George metropolitan area and is near Zion National Park. Hurricane is known for its historic peach and pecan orchards, open space, and green fields.

==History==
Hurricane was first settled in 1896 and received its name after a whirlwind blew the top off a buggy in which Erastus Snow was riding. Snow exclaimed, &quot;Well, that was a Hurricane. We&#x27;ll name this &#x27;Hurricane Hill&#x27;.&quot;

Hurricane, which is pronounced &quot;Her-ah-kun&quot; by local residents (mimicking the accent of early Liverpudlian settlers), is in eastern Washington County. The community was settled as part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27;s (LDS Church) President Brigham Young&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Mission&quot;, intended to establish the southern end of Utah for agricultural purposes. The town once operated a large peach and apricot orchard for the LDS Church and is historically known for small farms of peaches, pecans, and pistachio nuts.

The 1992 St. George earthquake destroyed three houses and various utilities, causing about in damage.

==Places of interest==
The town has multiple parks, a dog park, a city pool and large community center, several ranked golf courses, two recreational reservoirs (Sand Hollow and Quail Creek State Parks), and a small municipal airfield. The Hurricane Valley Heritage Park Museum is located on the corner of State Street and Main. The area has several medical clinics.

Hurricane Canal was focal to the Hurricane Valley for approximately 80 years. It was built in 11 years (1893–1904), mostly by pick and shovel. Since 1985, the canal has been empty. In 2000, special interest groups came together to preserve the canal, receiving grants and volunteering time to construct a trail in tribute to the efforts the early settlers put forth to make the canal a reality. A monument at the trailhead briefly recounts the canal story. Much of the trail, which covers a small section of the canal, is the actual west bank of the canal, which &quot;canal riders&quot; rode every day when the canal was in operation to ensure there were no leaks or other problems, because the bank was somewhat unstable. The trail provides views of the towns of Hurricane and La Verkin throughout. The trail ends before reaching the Virgin River Gorge, approximately five miles from the canal&#x27;s former headwaters.

Sand Hollow State Park contains a 1,322 acre reservoir, multiple camping locations, and off-roading trails, and is located in the south part of Hurricane. In addition to the sand beaches which are open to OHV&#x27;s, the state park provides tunnel access across Utah State Route 7 to the neighboring Sand Mountain, which houses the popular Hurricane Sand Dunes. Sand Hollow can be accessed from Utah State Route 9, via Sand Hollow Road, or from the State Route 7.

Quail Creek State Park has a 600-acre reservoir and a campground. The reservoir it partially fed by Quail Creek to the north. The reservoir is for fishing, boating, kayaking, and paddle-boarding. The state park can be accessed from either State Route 9 or Old Highway 91 via 5300 W/State Route 318.

The Virgin River forms nearly all of Hurricane&#x27;s north border. It travels through the city&#x27;s Confluence Park and crosses State Route 9 at both the Hurricane-La Verkin border and near Quail Creek 3 miles from Harrisburg Junction. The river indirectly provides water to Hurricane and most of Washington County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.39%) is water.

==Transportation==
U.S. Interstate 15 forms part of the northwest border of Hurricane. It has one exit, exit 16, that is located in Hurricane, and another exit, exit 27, that provides access to Hurricane from the north. I-15 is the main means of transportation to nearby St. George and also connects the town to Salt Lake City, 290 miles to the north, and Las Vegas, 138 miles to the south.

Utah State Route 9 begins in Hurricane, at Harrisburg Junction. It travels east through Hurricane, forming State Street. SR-9 links Hurricane to the nearby Zion National Park and to U.S. Route 89. State Route 9 is also Hurricane&#x27;s main connector to I-15.

Utah State Route 59 ends in Hurricane, at the intersection of SR-9 and Main Street. It connects Hurricane with the nearby Hilldale and indirectly connects Hurricane to Kanab and Lake Powell through Arizona State Route 389.

Utah State Route 7, also known as Southern Parkway, when finished with construction, will begin at State Route 9 just south of Hurricane&#x27;s business district and provide access to Washington and South St. George. State Route 7 has its western terminus just north of the Arizona border in St. George where it becomes Sun River Parkway at I-15.

Hurricane Municipal Airport, located in the south of Hurricane, is the city&#x27;s only public airstrip. It has only one runway, no taxiway, and only services small personal aircraft.

<text>Leeds is a town in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 820 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Formerly known as Bennington, Leeds was formed due to flooding in the neighboring town of Harrisburg. The residents in the flood-affected areas decided to move to this area in 1867. It was renamed in honor of Leeds in England, the origin of many of its settlers. In recent years, the city&#x27;s proximity to the ghost town of Silver Reef, the Pine Valley Mountains, and Zion National Park have changed the local economic base from agriculture to tourism.

On June 17, 2009, Utah police and forest rangers destroyed about 8,750 marijuana plants growing in Washington County. Law enforcement reported Mexican cartels have moved their growing operations to Utah to avoid the U.S.-Mexico border and police pressure in California. There were no arrests made and the marijuana fields were in the Pine Valley Mountains near Leeds. Doug Roe, a special agent with the United States Forest Service, said the plants were young and not ready for harvesting.

<text>Santa Clara is a town / city in Washington County, in southwestern Utah, (Western United States) and is a part of the St. George Metropolitan Area. The population has grown considerably in the last three decades, and was at 7,553 counted in the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census, up from 6,003 at the previous 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, and 4,630 at the earlier 2000 U.S. Decennial Census. The region and county borders the states of Arizona to the south and Nevada to the west. The town is a western suburb of the nearby county seat and larger city of St. George, Utah

==History==

In 1854, Jacob Hamblin (1819-1886), was called by Latter-day Saints Church Church patriarch Brigham Young (1801-1877), in the capital city of Salt Lake City, to serve a mission to the southern Paiute native areas of the recently organized old federal Utah Territory (1850-1896), and settled in the southwestern corner then of the Territory at Santa Clara, in the vicinity of the modern city of St. George, Utah. The town is among the oldest in the area and the state.

The first settlers built Fort Clara or also known as Fort Santa Clara, in the winter of 1855–1856. In the fall of 1861, Swiss immigrant members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) arrived at the new settlement. Shortly afterward, in early 1862, they were victims of a severe flood in the Santa Clara River valley that destroyed the fort and most other buildings, along with already existing irrigation dams and ditches. This event was part of the infamous Great Flood of 1862.

Hamblin&#x27;s first home in Santa Clara was destroyed in the 1862 flood. His second wife Rachael saved one of their young children from drowning, but the child soon after died from exposure. Rachael never fully recovered from exposure she suffered during the flood. Swearing to avoid such a risk again, Hamblin built a new home on a hill in Santa Clara. It is owned today by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which operates it as a house museum. Latter-day Saint missionaries give daily tours.

19th century Santa Clara was largely inhabited by immigrants who had earlier converted to Latter-day Saints faith in Switzerland of Europe and subsequently crossed the Atlantic Ocean and westward-moving across the North America continent to come to Utah. Among these was Daniel Bonelli, who after the 1862 flood became a pioneer colonist of St. Thomas, Nevada in the Moapa Valley. He was a farmer, salt miner, and owner of Bonelli&#x27;s Ferry, at nearby Rioville, Nevada. This was on the road between the old southwestern Utah Territory (1850-1896) and the old Arizona Territory (1863-1912) further south, at the confluence of the Virgin River and the Colorado River.

<text>St. George or Saint George is a city in and the county seat of Washington County, Utah, United States. Located in southwestern Utah on the Arizona border, it is the principal city of the St. George metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The city lies in the northeasternmost part of the Mojave Desert, immediately south of the Pine Valley Mountains, which mark the southern boundary of the Great Basin. St. George lies slightly northwest of the Colorado Plateau, which ends at the Hurricane Fault. The city is northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, and south-southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, on Interstate 15.

Its population was 95,342 at the 2020 census, with the overall MSA having an estimated population of 197,680. St. George is the fifth-largest city in Utah and most-populous city in the state outside of the Wasatch Front.

The city was settled in 1861 as a cotton mission, earning it the nickname &quot;Dixie&quot;. While the crop never became a successful commodity, the area steadily grew in population. Between 2000 and 2005, St. George emerged as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States. Today, the St. George region is well known for its year-round outdoor recreation and proximity to several state parks, Zion National Park, and the Grand Canyon. Utah Tech University, located in St. George, is an NCAA Division I institution.

==History==
St. George was founded as part of the cotton mission in 1861 under the direction of Latter Day Saint apostle Erastus Snow. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Brigham Young accelerated the colonization effort:
Fearing that the war would take away the cotton supply, he began plans for raising enough in this southwestern country to supply the needs of his people. Enough favorable reports had come to him from this warm region below the rim of the Great Basin, that he was convinced cotton could be raised successfully here. At the general church conference in Salt Lake City on October 6th, 1861, about three hundred families were &quot;called&quot; to the Dixie mission to promote the cotton industry. Most of the people knew nothing of this expedition until their names were read from the pulpit; but in nearly every case, they responded with good will, and made ready to leave within the month&#x27;s time allotted to them. The families were selected so as to ensure the communities the right number of farmers, masons, blacksmiths, businessmen, educators, carpenters, as needed.

The settlement was named after George A. Smith, an LDS Church apostle.

In April 1877, the LDS Church completed the St. George Utah Temple. It was the church&#x27;s third temple and is the oldest still in active use.

The 1992 St. George earthquake destroyed three houses, as well as above- and below-ground utilities, causing about in damage.

St. George was the location of the 1997 United States Academic Decathlon national finals.

In January 2005, a 100-year flood occurred throughout the region, due to prolonged heavy rainfall overflowing both the Virgin River and Santa Clara River. One person was killed and 28 homes were destroyed by the Santa Clara River.

===Nuclear contamination===
In the early 1950s, St. George received the brunt of the fallout of above-ground nuclear testing at the Yucca Flats/Nevada Test Site northwest of Las Vegas. Winds routinely carried the fallout of these tests directly through the St. George and southern Utah area. Marked increases in the frequency of cancer in the population, not limited to leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers, were reported from the mid-1950s until the early 1980s.

In 1980, American popular weekly magazine &quot;People&quot; reported that from about 220 cast and crew who filmed in a 1956 movie, &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, on location near St. George, 91 had come down with cancer, and 50 had died of cancer. Of these, 46 had died of cancer by 1980. Among the cancer deaths were John Wayne, Pedro Armendáriz, and Susan Hayward, the stars of the film. However, the lifetime odds of developing cancer for men in the U.S. population are 43% and the odds of dying of cancer are 23% (38 and 19%, respectively, for women). This places the cancer mortality rate for the 220 primary cast and crew quite near the expected average.

A 1962 United States Atomic Energy Commission report found children living in St. George at the time of the fallout may have received doses to their thyroids of radioiodine as high as 120 to 440 rads&quot; (1.2 to 4.4 Gy).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which (0.72%) is covered by water. St. George lies in a desert valley, with most of the city lying below 3,000 feet (900 m) in elevation. It is situated near a geological transition zone where the Colorado Plateau and Great Basin converge. The Beaver Dam Mountains/Utah Hill lie to the west, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and Pine Valley Mountains to the north, the western edge of the Colorado Plateau and Zion National Park to the east, and the Arizona Strip to the south. The Virgin River, the Santa Clara River and the seasonal Fort Pearce Wash flow through the St. George valley and converge near the western base of Webb Hill near the city center.

The city uses street numbers rather than names, such as &quot;East 100 South&quot;. Exceptions have been made for streets with curves or those not fitting into the traditional grid system. Some roads have names along with numerals, such as &quot;400 East&quot; which is also known as &quot;Flood Street&quot;.

===Neighborhoods===
Some neighborhoods are large housing developments created during the city&#x27;s rapid modern expansion; others carry the names of geographical features or unincorporated communities that have been annexed by St. George.

===Climate===
St. George&#x27;s arid climate is significantly warmer on average than the rest of the state, and more closely resembles nearby Las Vegas. The climate is cold arid (&quot;BWk&quot;). St. George has long, hot summers and relatively mild winters. The monthly average temperature ranges from in December to in July. On average, 60 afternoons have high temperatures over , with an average window of June 29 through August 13, and 122 days with high temperatures over with the average window fluctuating between late April and early October. About 60 mornings have low temperature drops to the freezing mark, with the historical average window between November 12 and March 14.

The highest temperature statewide was , which was recorded in south St. George, near the Arizona border on July 4, 2007, breaking the previous record holder, at , also set in St. George on July 5, 1985. The record high minimum temperature is set on July 15, 1970, and July 3, 2013. Nighttime freezes are common during the winter due to radiational cooling. Both the record low temperature of and record low maximum temperature of were set on January 22, 1937; the record low temperature occurred again on January 26, 1937, both during the record cold month of January 1937 across the Western United States.

The city has abundant sunshine year-round and averages about 300 sunny days per year, with an average of precipitation annually. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; has been from July 2004 to June 2005 with at least (some days were missing) and the driest from July 1973 to June 1974 with . Record-breaking widespread flooding occurred during January 2005 when area creeks and rivers far exceeded their banks and washed out homes and some neighborhoods. The wettest month has been January 1993, when fell. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, except for a markedly drier period from April through June, which occurs after the Pacific storm season ends, but before the southwest monsoon begins, usually in mid-July. Precipitation mostly comes from the Pacific Ocean from late fall through early spring. The storm track usually lifts north of the city by mid-April. The monsoon brings localized and often intense thunderstorms from early July through mid-September. The greatest rainfall in 24 hours was on August 31, 1909.

The St. George valley occasionally receives wet or slushy snowfall in the winter, but what accumulates usually melts off by the mid- to late morning; the normal seasonal snowfall is . The earliest snowfall was measured on October 29, 1971, and the latest on April 11, 1927. The record single-day snowfall is , which was set on January 5, 1974. With the city having elevations ranging from , some areas such as Diamond Valley and Winchester Hills typically receive more snowfall and colder temperatures than the rest of the lower valley.
The most recent major snow event was on December 8, 2013, when between virtually shut down the city, making it the third-heaviest snowfall in the city&#x27;s history. Also significant about the storm was how low temperatures dropped and remained so for several days with daytime highs failing to reach the freezing mark, and one nighttime low temperature of , recorded at the airport, was the coldest in the city in over 100 years. The cold spell killed or severely damaged much of the area&#x27;s non-native vegetation, such as the Mexican fan palm trees.

<text>Kathenotheism is a term coined by the philologist Max Müller to mean the worship of one god at a time. It is closely related to henotheism, the worship of one god while not rejecting the existence of other gods. Müller coined the term in reference to the Vedas, where he explained each deity is treated as supreme in turn.

==Etymology==

Kathenotheism, a more specific form of henotheism, refers to the worship of a succession of supreme gods &quot;one at a time&quot;, from the Greek &quot;kath&#x27; hena&quot; &quot;one by one&quot; + &quot;theism&quot;.

==Ancient Greece==
The ancient Orphic religion had a polytheistic theology. The deities were each distinct individuals that were not equated with one another.

==Hinduism==
The Smarta Tradition of Hinduism worship the five major deities as supreme in turn and collectively.

The town of Grayson also wanted the library prize, so in a compromise in 1916, Grayson took the name of Blanding, Mr. Bicknell&#x27;s wife&#x27;s maiden name, as a tribute to her parents. The two towns split the library, each receiving 500 books.

<text>North Ogden is a city in Weber County, Utah, United States. The population was 20,916 at the 2020 census. North Ogden is on SR-235, three miles north of Ogden. It is a suburb of that city and is part of the Ogden-Clearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Among the first people to dwell in the North Ogden area were the Shoshone. The Shoshoni name for the area is “Opecarry,” which translates to “stick in the head.”

North Ogden was settled by European-American settlers during the winter of 1850 by two sets of cattle ranchers from Ogden. The Campbells and the Riddles had been warned by Brigham Young not to venture from the fort in Ogden due to the troubles with the local Shoshone. After a few months wintering their cattle, they were forced to return to Ogden in fear of Shoshone reprisals. The following year, after the trouble with the Shoshone had been partially settled, Jonathan Campbell returned with a number of other families to permanently settle the spot.

One important early industry in the mid to late 19th century was the sugar beet industry, and a processing and canning plant was built in the town for this. The owner of the canning plant during its operation was David Ephriam Randall. North Ogden also built a spur from the Union Pacific Station in Ogden, called the &quot;Dummy Line&quot;. Large fruit orchards were developed and their harvest became an economic staple for the community, with the establishment of the North Ogden Fruit Exchange in 1924. This became the region&#x27;s first fruit cooperative, using the railroad to sell fruit on the interstate market.

In the 1930s, increasing demand for water led the city to officially incorporate on February 1, 1934. David Gilbert Randall was elected the first mayor. He served in this position for ten years. That same decade saw the creation of the Cherry Days celebration on July 4. As North Ogden grew after World War II, it became a primary suburb for Ogden and other larger cities. Its industries flagged, and most agricultural areas began to be parcelled out for homes.

On November 3, 2018, after taking special leave from his mayoral position to serve in Afghanistan with the National Guard, Brent R. Taylor was shot and killed on duty by an Afghan commando.
Every year a large American flag is suspended in the air above Coldwater Canyon to honor him and the Veterans of the United States Armed Forces.

<text>Ogden ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Weber County, Utah, United States, approximately east of the Great Salt Lake and north of Salt Lake City. The population was 87,321 in 2020, according to the US Census Bureau, making it Utah&#x27;s eighth largest city. The city served as a major railway hub through much of its history, and still handles a great deal of freight rail traffic which makes it a convenient location for manufacturing and commerce. Ogden is also known for its many historic buildings, proximity to the Wasatch Mountains, and as the location of Weber State University.

Ogden is a principal city of the Ogden-Clearfield metropolitan area, which includes all of Weber, Morgan, Davis, and Box Elder counties. The 2010 Census placed the Metro population at 597,159. In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated the Metro as the 6th best place to raise a family. Ogden has had a sister city relationship to Hof in Bavaria, Germany, since 1954.

==History==

Originally named Fort Buenaventura, Ogden was the first permanent settlement by people of European descent in what is now Utah. It was established by the trapper Miles Goodyear in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today.

In November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico. The settlement was then called Brownsville, after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Peter Skene Ogden, who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which &quot;Ogden&quot; was the first to set foot in the area. A Samuel Ogden traveled through the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park.
Ogden is the closest sizable city to the Golden Spike location at Promontory Summit, Utah, where the first transcontinental railroad was joined in 1869. It was known as a major passenger railroad junction owing to its location along major east–west and north–south routes, prompting the local chamber of commerce to adopt the motto, &quot;You can&#x27;t get anywhere without coming to Ogden.&quot; Railroad passengers traveling west to San Francisco from the eastern United States typically passed through Ogden (and not through the larger Salt Lake City to the south). However, Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, no longer serves Ogden. Passengers who want to travel to and from Ogden by rail must travel via &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail to Salt Lake City and Provo. Renowned Danish impressionistic writer Herman Bang died in Ogden in 1912 during a lecture tour in the United States.

In 1972, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints completed construction of and dedicated the Ogden Utah Temple in Ogden. The temple was built to serve the area&#x27;s large LDS population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle. The work which began in 2011 includes an update to the exterior, the removal of the Tabernacle&#x27;s steeple to make the Temple&#x27;s steeple a main focus, and a new underground parking garage and gardens. The Temple was rededicated in 2014.

Because Ogden had historically been Utah&#x27;s second-largest city, it is home to a large number of historic buildings. However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and Provo had surpassed Ogden in population.

The Defense Depot Ogden Utah operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some of its have been converted into a commercial and industrial park called the Business Depot Ogden, colloquially known as &quot;BDO&quot;.

Two ships in the United States Navy have been named after the Ogden: in 1943, and in 1964. On September 17, 2024, the National Park Service announced that Ogden had been named a World War II Heritage City.

==Government and politics==

Ogden is governed under the mayor-council form of government, in which the full-time mayor serves as an executive while the seven-member part-time council serves as the legislative branch. All these elected officials serve four-year terms, with elections occurring in odd-numbered years and terms beginning in January of even-numbered years.

The mayor is Ben Nadolski, who took office on January 2, 2024. The city council members are Bart Blair, Angela Choberka, Dave Graf, Richard Hyer, Shaun Myers, Ken Richey, and Marcia White. Four of the council members represent the city&#x27;s four municipal districts, while the other three (Blair, Myers, and White) are elected at-large by voters from the entire city.

The Ogden City government operates on a budget of $267 million per year and employs over 600 full-time workers. In addition to providing the usual municipal services, the government promotes business and economic development. The city operates a redevelopment agency (RDA), with the city council acting as the RDA governing board and the mayor as its executive director. The RDA&#x27;s activity has increased since its establishment in 1969, with tax increment revenues at about $10 million per year and an outstanding debt of over $50 million. Designated redevelopment districts now cover nearly all of Ogden&#x27;s central business districts, as are Business Depot Ogden and several other industrial areas in the western parts of the city.

Much of the recent political discourse in Ogden has focused on controversial government-sponsored development projects in the downtown area, including the Ogden Eccles Conference Center, Lindquist Field, The Junction, the Ogden River Project, and other proposals that have not moved forward. A proposed streetcar connecting downtown to Weber State University has attracted considerable attention but only limited support. A major controversy flared up in 2005–07 when the mayor and many others pushed unsuccessfully for construction of a luxury residential development on public land in Ogden&#x27;s foothills and a new ski resort in the mountains above the city, to be accessed by a pair of aerial gondolas. Other local political concerns include Ogden&#x27;s relatively high tax and utility rates, efforts to fight crime, allegations of government corruption, and challenges facing the Ogden City schools.

==Economy==

As the principal city of the 2nd largest MSA in Utah, Ogden serves as an economic hub for the northern part of the state. Much of the central city is occupied by offices of federal, state, county, and municipal government entities. The Internal Revenue Service has a large regional facility in Ogden and is the city&#x27;s largest employer with over 5,000 employees. Other large employers include McKay Dee Hospital, Weber State University, Ogden City School District, Autoliv, Fresenius, and Convergys.

In 2013, Ogden ranked No. 16 on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.

The western parts of the city have several industrial areas. The largest is Business Depot Ogden, a former Army depot that was restructured to be a 1,000-plus acre business park.

==Transportation==

Interstates 15 and 84 serve the city. I-84 runs east–west through the southern suburbs, merging with I-15 near Riverdale. I-15 runs north–south near the city&#x27;s western edge and provides connections to the rest of the Wasatch Front and beyond. Ogden is served directly by exits 341, 342, 343, and 344. US-89 enters the city from the south, running through the city as Washington Boulevard, which serves as the main street of Ogden. It then continues north to Brigham City. State Route 39 runs east–west through the city as 12th Street, and continues eastward through Ogden Canyon providing access to Pineview Reservoir and the mountain and ski resort town of Huntsville.

The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates several services within and to/from Ogden. The OGX bus line operates between Ogden Central Station and Weber State University (WSU). Additional bus routes service Ogden, and connect Ogden to Brigham City, the northernmost extension of UTA&#x27;s bus system, and to Weber and Davis counties. 

Ogden Central Station is serviced by UTA&#x27;s commuter rail system, FrontRunner, which, in addition to several bus lines, provides a direct route from the Ogden to Salt Lake City. Greyhound also services Ogden via Ogden Central station via highway I-15.

Amtrak service is provided with a bus connection running to/from Salt Lake City, where there are daily California Zephyr trains west to the Oakland, California area and east to Chicago, Illinois. Amtrak trains do not serve Ogden directly. Historically, Ogden Union Station served as a hub for frequent trains going northwest to Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, and east to Chicago. Amtrak ended the &quot;Pioneer&quot; in 1997. In the same year, Amtrak ended the Los Angeles to Chicago &quot;Desert Wind.&quot;

Ogden–Hinckley Airport, Utah&#x27;s busiest municipal airport, is in the southwest portion of the city. The only commercial service is operated by Breeze Airways with nonstop service to Orange County, California. Allegiant Air offered commercial service from Ogden to Phoenix and Mesa, Arizona, Avelo Airlines served Burbank, California, while Utah Airways offers charter service to many of the West&#x27;s national parks. As of May 2022, both Allegiant and Avelo ceased service, citing rising costs and dropping ticket sales, in addition to expanded availability of air carriers at Salt Lake International airport just 35 minutes south.

==Sports and recreation==

The mountains and rivers near Ogden offer many opportunities for outdoor recreation.

An extensive trail system, immediately adjacent to the city&#x27;s eastern edge, gives residents and visitors immediate access to the foothills of the Wasatch Range. The foothill trails are used for hiking, running, mountain biking, and sometimes snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Steeper trails climb eastward into the mountains, and many other mountain trails originate within a few miles of the city. A system of paved urban trails runs along the banks of the Ogden and Weber Rivers.

The quartzite cliffs above Ogden&#x27;s foothills provide a variety of rock climbing routes. An extensive boulder field in the foothills is one of the most popular bouldering sites in the state. 

On the mountains east of Ogden are three downhill ski areas: Snowbasin, Powder Mountain, and Nordic Valley. Popular sites for cross-country skiing include Snowbasin and Weber County&#x27;s North Fork Park.

Kayaking is a popular sport on portions of the Ogden and Weber Rivers. A developed kayak park lies on the Weber River in the western portion of the city. The reservoirs near Ogden are used for a wide variety of water sports.

<text>Plain City is a city in Weber County, Utah, United States. The population was 5,476 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ogden–Clearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Salt Lake Valley settlement began when wagon trains of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began arriving in 1847. By 1858, farmers from the then-settled towns of Lehi and Kay&#x27;s Creek, looking for a new place to homestead, began considering the area now known as Plain City. On 17 March 1859, led by Lorin Farr, a group arrived to begin homesteading. Soon after arriving, the group surveyed a townsite and assigned building lots. The town layout used an organized grid system of blocks and streets, originally six blocks north-to-south and three blocks east-to-west. Each block was in area, divided into 4 lots. The first settlers were allowed their choice in the selection of a lot.

===Trucking===
Plain City residents were responsible for the creation and growth of several nationwide trucking companies:
*Maude Knight married Chester Rodney England in 1916; he founded C.R. England Trucking in 1920 to haul produce for nearby farmers.
*Carl Moyes, a driver for C.R. England in the 1940s, and his two sons, Jerry and Ronald, were childhood friends with Jeff England, son of Gene and grandson of Chester. Carl would leave C.R. England to found his own company with his wife, Betty, B &amp; C Truck Leasing.
*Carl and Betty hired the Knight cousins to drive for them. Carl and his two sons relocated to Phoenix, Arizona in 1966, and founded Common Market, a trucking company which was known as Swift Transportation by 1969.
*Jeff England started Pride Transport in 1979 in Salt Lake City.
*Brothers Kevin and Keith Knight, and two of their cousins who had driven for Swift Transportation in Phoenix, Randy and Gary Knight, banded together to start Knight Transportation in 1990.

==Points of interest==
The area became a popular tourist stop because of the natural hot springs located in its north western corner that lies adjacent to Box Elder County. The Utah Hot Springs Resort was created at the site in the 1880s. During its peak, the facility offered visitors bathing and swimming pools, a hotel with 40 rooms, a dance hall, and a saloon where a mug of beer could be bought for five cents. The facility no longer exists.

Since 2008 until 2018 (until future line extension), the Pleasant View station has been (although for limited service) the northern end of Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s commuter rail service, the &quot;FrontRunner&quot;.
==Education==
Pleasant View is part of the Weber School District. It operates Weber High School Orchard Springs Elementary School.

Once called &quot;Stringtown&quot; due to the early homes being strung along a single road and the Weber River, Riverdale was also known as &quot;Jack Thompson&#x27;s Settlement&quot; and &quot;Union&quot; before the name of Riverdale was given to the town.

The first settlers in the community were James Graham, his sons George and Robert, and other members of the Graham family. They farmed in the area as early as 1850. Elisha Lane located nearby, as did William Farley, and Rufus Allen. Other early settlers of Riverdale included Adam Fife, Alexander Patterson, Warren Gould Child Sr, Thomas Slater, Richard Woolsey, John Child, John C. Thompson, William Stimpson, Myron Barber Child, Richard Dye, and George Ritter.

Daniel Burch built a grist mill along the eastern bank of the Weber River in 1853. John Taylor, an LDS apostle, purchased and expanded the mill in 1858. Other industries began establishing, including match manufacturing (by Hugh Findlay, who later served as the settlement&#x27;s first teacher), a blacksmith shop, and a canning factory.

The town of Riverdale was finally incorporated on March 4, 1946.

<text>Roy is a city in Weber County, Utah, United States, on the west side of Interstate 15. The population in 2020 was 39,306; an increase of 6.6% from 36,884 at the 2010 census. Roy is part of the Ogden-Clearfield metropolitan area, and is considered a suburb of nearby Ogden, although some small businesses are present in Roy.

==History==
Roy was settled in 1873 by William Evans Baker, Esther Celestia Cole Baker, and their children, 25 years after Ogden. Most of the communities to the east and south had already been settled. Previously known as Central City, Sandridge, the Basin, and Lakeview, Roy was ultimately named for a local schoolteacher&#x27;s child, Roy C. Peebles, who had died. On May 24, 1894, a post office was established and Roy&#x27;s name was made official. The City of Roy was incorporated on March 10, 1937. Joseph William Jensen was Roy&#x27;s first mayor, elected by the commissioners and serving for six years.

Roy&#x27;s businesses were limited until the early 1940s. A gas station, several grocery stores, a cafe, and a lumberyard made up the modest business district. But Roy developed rapidly during World War II. It housed many of the workers and personnel from adjacent military installations, including Hill Air Force Base, the Navy Supply Depot (now the Freeport Center), and the Defense Supply Depot. September 1953 marked a milestone in Roy&#x27;s history—Roy received a charter to establish Utah&#x27;s first branch bank. This branch of the Bank of Utah pioneered the way for other banks to establish branches in the state. Norton Parker, son of Mayor Dean Parker, was the first manager of this new branch.

Roy&#x27;s population growth was extreme in the 1950s and 1960s, when most of the eastern bench was populated with entry-level homes. Starting in the 1980s, construction efforts shifted to the bottom of the hill on Roy&#x27;s west side, continuing until about 2005, when new real estate shifted west and south.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Interstate 15 via exit 338, leading to Utah State Route 97 (5600 South), one of Roy&#x27;s major roads. The northern entrance of Hill Air Force Base is accessible from this exit, making Roy a common destination for those in the military.

FrontRunner has a station in Roy that opened on April 26, 2008, along with the rest of the northern segment. Two sets of train tracks bisect the city at 2700 West, being served by FrontRunner and Union Pacific Railroad.

==History==
The area was settled by members of the Mormon pioneers. Daniel Burch and his family arrived in Brownsville (Ogden) in 1848. Burch came from Kentucky with the Lorenzo Snow company of Utah pioneers. In 1850 the area was named Burch Creek in his honor. In 1852 the Weber Canal was built and Burch built a gristmill near its source in what is now Riverdale.

The Ogden City Council founded a six-room isolation facility for smallpox patients in Burch Creek in 1882. The area was a farming community with several dairy farms. There was little development until 1890 when extensive investments in land, both residential and commercial, took place.

Burch Creek Elementary and Junior High School was built in 1897. It was the first school in the area and was considered one of the most modern in the state. The first church building, the Ogden LDS 14th Ward, was erected in 1925.

In the 1930s Burch Creek was a farming community of about 800 people in need of more water. The water supply was augmented in 1934, a year of serious drought, when the Federal Drought Relief Agency financed the installation of a water supply line from Burch Creek Canyon. The question of annexing Burch Creek to Ogden was raised many times, but each time the proposal was rejected by a majority of the people. Burch Creek was in need of a sewer system, more water, roads, and sidewalks. In 1936 a committee petitioned Weber County commissioners to allow incorporation. The petition was granted and on July 6, 1936 the town of South Ogden was established.

South Ogden&#x27;s close location to Hill Air Force Base and the Ogden Arsenal led to a housing boom in the 1940s. By 1946 the population exceeded 3,600, and South Ogden became known as the &quot;City of Homes.&quot; The largest growth for the city came in the 1950s, at which time it grew by 150 percent. Because of this new growth, a new municipal building was constructed. The building also housed a fire station, and a new 1953 fire truck was purchased. Washington Boulevard was widened to four lanes south of 40th Street.

Mormon pioneers settled the area, and the LDS Church is still well represented, with several chapels located in the city. The Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration was consecrated on December 18, 1969; the Holy Family Catholic Church was dedicated on May 26, 1981; and a few smaller denominations are also housed in the city.

In 2001, South Ogden elected Utah&#x27;s first African American mayor—Mayor George Garwood. He beat his opponent 2,010 votes to 776. After his election Mayor Garwood said, &quot;It&#x27;s a joyous day, not just for the citizens of South Ogden but also for the citizens in Utah. To look beyond the color of a person&#x27;s skin and to see their character is a great thing.&quot;

==History==

===Kanesville===
The first settlers in what would become Kanesville arrived in 1868. At the time the area was known as Northwest Hooper.
Kanesville was named for Thomas L. Kane. The name Kanesville was adopted when an LDS Ward was first organized there in 1882. The first bishop was Peter B. Peterson.

The name is retained by Kanesville School, a K-6 school in West Haven. Until October 2010 the Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city was the Kanesville Utah Stake. On October 17, 2010, the Kanesville Utah Stake was divided and a new stake, the West Haven Utah Stake, was formed. The old stake retained the Kanesville name.

===Wilson===
Wilson, Utah was formed in 1854. It was named after the four Wilson brothers who began farming in the area in 1854. An irrigation company was formed in 1879 and an LDS Ward was organized in 1882. The first bishop was Brigham Heber Bingham. The first settler to live in the area that became Wilson was John Martin. He moved from Ogden and was the first to move west of the Weber River in 1856. The Wilson Brothers started farming in the area west of the Weber River in 1854, but lived in Ogden. (History from the book, &quot;Mormon John Martin&quot; Utah Pioneer Family History copyright 1969 by Drucilla H. McFarland. Carr Printing.)

<text>Ferrisburgh is a town in Addison County, Vermont, United States. It was founded June 24, 1762. The population was 2,646 at the 2020 census. The town is sometimes spelled Ferrisburg.

==History==

The site that would eventually become Ferrisburgh was originally called Varenbrug, or &#x27;Fern Bridge&#x27; by Dutch explorers from the colony of New Amsterdam. The Dutch operated a trading post at the site, doing business with French voyageurs and Native American merchants until it was abandoned during the course of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1673. The English burned the old Dutch trading post, and did not settle the area, which eventually became a meeting site for diverse peoples. The Abenaki and Iroquois nations maintained friendly relations at the site in the absence of European power. The site would not be contested militarily again until the American Revolution, where it saw ancillary action leading up to the Battle of Hubbardton.

Ferrisburgh was named for Benjamin Ferris, who applied for a charter in 1762.

Although the Rokeby Museum tells the story of Ferrisburgh&#x27;s long history in the abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad, Ferrisburgh sent many of its sons off to war during the American Civil War. Ferrisburghers made up roughly 10% of the &quot;Old Brigade.&quot; Many wives and sisters from Ferrisburgh joined their husbands and brothers on the front lines as camp followers. Ferrisburgh women found themselves involved in rear guard action during the Battle of Gettysburg, as Confederate soldiers stormed Big Round Top. As Confederate pickets fired upon Union positions, Vermont women from Ferrisburgh were in the line of fire. Laura Fitzgerald, an Irish immigrant to Ferrisburgh, fired a musket towards the Confederate lines, causing the snipers to scatter.

From 1917 to 1924, an art colony was formed in the town of Ferrisburgh, mostly consisting of dissident Middlebury College and University of Vermont faculty of arts members who disapproved of their respective administrations lack of funding for &quot;degenerate arts,&quot; associated with dadaism including photography of sculpture-making, portraiture of nude sculptors, portraiture of photography of still life, and post-revisionist allegorical thoughtscapes. The art colony went by several lengthy and increasingly bizarre names, and is colloquially known as the Ferrisburgh Art Colony. Artists and provocateurs from around the greater New England region came to the colony to express appreciation for the more esoteric arts, as well as to hold more than one rally in support of radical politics.

==Geography==
Ferrisburgh is located in the northwest corner of Addison County. Its western boundary is the Vermont–New York border as it runs up the center of Lake Champlain. Otter Creek, one of the longest rivers in Vermont, enters Lake Champlain in Ferrisburgh between Fields Bay and Porter Bay. The original settlement of Ferrisburgh anticipated an eventual population of 25,000 inhabitants, a number not yet reached as of the 2010 census.

Ferrisburgh is bordered by the town of Charlotte, in Chittenden County, to the north. Neighboring towns within Addison County are Monkton to the east, New Haven to the southeast, and Waltham and Panton to the south. The city of Vergennes also lies on the southern border, between Waltham and Panton. To the west, across Lake Champlain, is the New York town of Westport. The town of Essex, New York, touches the northernmost part of the Ferrisburgh border within Lake Champlain.

Communities within the town include the town center, Ferrisburgh, plus the settlement of North Ferrisburgh (or North Ferrisburg) near the town&#x27;s northern boundary. Basin Harbor is a small community on the shore of Lake Champlain that has frequently been the site of dispute over the town&#x27;s lakeside boundary with Vergennes, as well as the State of New York.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Ferrisburgh has a total area of , of which is land and , or 22.46%, is water.

Amtrak&#x27;s daily &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; train serves the station, providing direct rail service to Burlington, Middlebury, Rutland, Albany, and New York City.

==Notable people==

* Stewart Van Vliet, Union Army general during the American Civil War

==Schools==
Ferrisburgh has one school, Ferrisburgh Central School, which has grades K to 6. Students then attend Vergennes Union High School. In 1961, Ferrisburgh was mentioned as a possible site for the relocation of Johnson State College, which had swelled to nearly 8,000 undergraduates. The plan was abandoned when the Town Clerk of Ferrisburgh, Walter Munger-Foy, held up the sale of 10 Acres of land in the western part of the town by purchasing it himself. He then sought to charge Johnson State College nearly double what it had already agreed to with the municipality. Munger-Foy was stripped of his position of Town Clerk, and eventually convicted of an unrelated homicide.

Ferrisburgh is home to the Rokeby Museum, a site on the Underground Railroad. The Rokeby Museum was selected in 2012 as Vermont&#x27;s &#x27;Most Compelling Historical Site&#x27; by the Ferriburgh Beacon&#x27;s editorial staff. The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum is located in Basin Harbor village of Ferrisburgh. The Union Meetinghouse, a historic landmark, is located there. Button Bay State Park and Kingsland Bay State Park are located in Ferrisburgh along Lake Champlain.

In the fall of 2010, Vermont&#x27;s first 1 MW solar farm was installed in Ferrisburgh.

<text>Lincoln is a town in Addison County, Vermont, United States. Lincoln is at the base of Mount Abraham in the Green Mountains. It was settled by Quakers in the late 18th century. The population was 1,323 at the 2020 census. Lincoln is known for its rural beauty and its proximity to two Vermont ski areas, Mad River Glen and Sugarbush.

==Geography==
Lincoln is in northeastern Addison County in the Green Mountains. The Long Trail runs along the crest of the Green Mountains near the town&#x27;s eastern border, with elevations ranging from at Lincoln Gap to at the summit of Mount Abraham. The lowest elevation in town is above sea level near West Lincoln, where the New Haven River exits the town.

The Lincoln Gap Road crosses the Green Mountains at Lincoln Gap, connecting the village of Lincoln on the west with the town of Warren to the east. But it is only open in the summer, so the town is principally accessed via Bristol. The village of South Lincoln is in the southern part of the town, along the New Haven River. There are no numbered state highways in Lincoln.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which are land and , or 0.43%, are water.

In the town, the age distribution of the population shows 27.1% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 27.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.7 males.

The per capita income for the town was $21,092. About 4.3% of families and 5.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.4% of those under age 18 and 1.5% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
Lincoln was chartered to Colonel Benjamin Simonds and 64 associates on November 9, 1780. As commander of the Massachusetts militia, Simonds fought at the Battle of Bennington in 1777. He named the new town in honor of his commanding officer, Major General Benjamin Lincoln, who played a vital role in getting the militia to Vermont. General Lincoln was respected and well liked by his contemporaries.

Like Ferrisburgh and several other Addison County towns, Lincoln was settled by members of the Society of Friends, or Quakers. The first Quakers settled in an area known as Mud Flat about 1795. As other Quakers joined the original group, the area became known as Quaker Stand. The meeting house is gone and the Society has dispersed, but one part of Lincoln village is still called Quaker Street. Lincoln&#x27;s town government was officially organized in 1798, when the first town meeting was held in the log cabin of early settler Jedediah Durfee.

Until the latter part of the 20th century, Lincoln&#x27;s economy centered around smallholder agriculture, ironworks, and mills. The earliest export products were potash and timber, sold by homesteading farmers after clearing their land. The town&#x27;s population and economy peaked in the 1880s, when 15 lumber mills in town made shingles and clapboard, employing around 100 men. Dairies and potato farming comprised much of the rest of the town&#x27;s industry. Lincoln also grew to comprise the settlements of Downingsville and West, South, and Center Lincoln, bringing it to its present area of 44 square miles. The town&#x27;s proximity to the New Haven River has caused destructive floods in its history, in 1830, 1869, 1938, 1976, and 1998.

In 1919, Lincoln-born businessman Walter S. Burnham left a significant endowment to the town in his will, resulting in the creation of the Burnham Trust, a fund intended to &quot;be expended for educational, charitable, and musical purposes.&quot; The Trust provided funding for the construction of Burnham Hall, a community meeting place and formerly the town library, as well as establishing a scholarship fund for future Lincoln students. Burnham Hall remains the site of Lincoln&#x27;s town meeting.

Lincoln underwent a significant contraction in the mid-20th century, as its resource-based livelihoods dried up and families moved away. Dairy farms were unable to compete with larger, centralized enterprises elsewhere in the state and country. For Lincoln, the industry&#x27;s death knell came in the 1980s, when the federal government offered to buy out smaller farms in an attempt to raise the price of milk and thereby make the industry more profitable; Lincoln&#x27;s last dairy closed in 1992. Most of the mills and other industry also closed by the end of the century, though one pallet mill remains in operation. In 1968 Lincoln lost its post office (and thus its ZIP code) when postal services were transferred to Bristol.

In the 21st century, Lincoln&#x27;s population has rebounded almost to its peak. Its proximity to the Green Mountains, tranquility, and well-supported community services have made it attractive as a residential community. Most working-age adults commute to jobs in neighboring towns, but Lincoln still has a general store, hotel, and multiple small-batch maple syrup producers, with some larger producers (the largest has 35,000 trees tapped).

On September 11, 2010, the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in North America was consecrated in Lincoln.

==Community==
Lincoln is home to a community church, the United Church of Lincoln, which is in the center of town at the bottom of Quaker Street. The Lincoln General Store serves as a main community hub, as there is no post office or gas station in town.

==History==
After the construction of Fort Independence on Mount Independence in 1775, rebel soldiers bravely manned the lesser fortifications of the Vermont-side defenses. While those soldiers billeted at Fort Ticonderoga enjoyed comparatively splendid conditions in the French-style fort, Mount Independence proved a trying and difficult environment for its small cadre of revolutionary defenders, who frequently returned to their farms in the surrounding countryside to tend to their homesteads. The fortress was passed between the British and Colonials, until it was eventually abandoned at the cessation of hostilities on the northern front of the war.

Orwell enjoyed a time of peace and prosperity after the war&#x27;s conclusion, marking a time of great emotional uprising and town glee. However, these bright times would be marred by several major tragedies that coincided with the attempted industrialization of the area&#x27;s farmlands in the 1870s, when several young men were lost in a thresher accident near what is now the intersection of Main Street and Route 22A. This tragedy was keenly remembered by the community, which banned industrial farming later that year in a special town meeting. Industrialized farm equipment was only allowed back into Orwell after the economic collapse of the early 1900s, and even then, special restrictions were placed to limit the capabilities of such farm instruments. The town&#x27;s law against the use of &quot;Modern Farm Machinery of All Kinds&quot; was never actually repealed, and continues to be a curio law on the books that the town refuses to repeal.

Orwell attempted in the late 1990s to obtain a franchised fast-food restaurant, as a vital link in the food availability between Whitehall, New York, and Vergennes, Vermont, but the residents of the surrounding townships blocked the move, claiming it would upset the rural beauty of the western Vermont countryside. Orwell is known as the Fortress of America. The town motto is &quot;First in Revolution, First in Recreation&quot;.

<text>Panton is a town in Addison County, Vermont, United States. The population was 646 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Panton is located in northwestern Addison County, along the New York–Vermont border. The western side of the town extends into Lake Champlain, and Dead Creek is a broad water body that crosses the entire town south to north near the town center. Otter Creek forms much of the eastern border of the town. Neighboring towns and cities are Ferrisburgh to the north, Vergennes to the northeast, Waltham to the east, and Addison to the south. Bordering across Lake Champlain, which is approximately wide in this area, is the town of Westport, New York.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Panton has a total area of , of which is land and , or 29.70%, is water. As is common in the Champlain Valley, much of the land in Panton is flat and suitable for agriculture. For centuries, locals have quarried and used a native stone, known as Panton Stone, for building foundations and walls. The stone collected in Panton is from the Ordovician Crown Point Formation, therefore it is common to find fossils of invertebrates preserved in objects made from Panton Stone.

==Demographics==

Retreating from the Battle of Valcour Island, one of the first naval battles of the American Revolutionary War, American General Benedict Arnold ordered his men to run their five vessels aground in Ferris Bay (now called Arnold&#x27;s Bay) in Panton, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship Congress.

==In popular culture==

The station agent who advises the protagonist about visiting a secretive coastal town in H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s horror novella &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot; says that he originally came from Panton.

<doc id="137236" wikidata="Q1004225" url="?curid=137236" title="Vergennes, Vermont">
<text>Vergennes is a city located in the northwest quadrant of Addison County, Vermont, United States. The municipality is bordered by the towns of Ferrisburgh, Panton, and Waltham. As of the 2020 census, its population was 2,553. It is the smallest of Vermont&#x27;s 10 cities in terms of population, though the city of Winooski has the smallest area. It was the first city chartered in the state of Vermont and is the only city in Addison County.

==History==
Vergennes was settled in 1766 by Donald MacIntosh. It was established as a city in 1788, the only one in Vermont not to have been first chartered as a town or independent village. Instead, intersecting portions of the pre-existing towns of New Haven, Panton, and Ferrisburg at the Otter Creek Falls were combined to form Vergennes. It is the smallest city by population in Vermont.

The city is named for Frenchman Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, who greatly aided the rebel colonial effort in the American Revolutionary War.

Here, Thomas Macdonough built and armed the fleet that defeated the British on Lake Champlain during the War of 1812. The Monkton Iron Company (which was at the time the largest iron works in the nation) manufactured the fittings for Macdonough&#x27;s fleet, as well as most of the cannon shot used by the United States Army in the north. The ore used was mined in nearby Monkton. , , , and were built or refitted in Vergennes as a part of that fleet.

Organizers chose a city form of municipal government in anticipation of developing the area as an industrial center. The Otter Creek Falls provided power for mills and factories, and the close access to the Lake Champlain waterway was ideal for transportation both north and south. Industry boomed in the late 19th century; in particular, shipping connected to the Champlain Canal and wood-finishing related to lumber imported from Canada. As railways supplanted and bypassed the canal system, manufacturing declined in the city. A railroad spur from Ferrisburgh to the base of the falls proved a failure, as the grades were too steep for practical operations. Commercial decline continued in the 20th century, narrowing down to a few surviving companies. In the early years of the 21st century, a group of civic boosters and merchants improved the downtown area along Main Street and reconnected the city to its waterways. The resulting development, catering to tourists and transients, is hampered by centralization of land ownership and escalation of commercial rents.

In July 2022, Vergennes was reconnected to the national passenger rail network when Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; began serving Ferrisburgh–Vergennes station. The city had last seen passenger service in 1953, when the Rutland Railroad discontinued the &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot; (New York City - Montreal).

Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 2.6% of the population.

Of the 979 households, 34.3% had children under 18 living with them, 48.8% were married couples living together, 11.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.4% were not families.

<doc id="137241" wikidata="Q55402" url="?curid=137241" title="Yasujirō Ozu">
<text>was a Japanese filmmaker. He began his career during the era of silent films, and his last films were made in colour in the early 1960s. Ozu first made a number of short comedies, before turning to more serious themes in the 1930s.
The most prominent themes of Ozu&#x27;s work are family and marriage, and especially the relationships between generations. His most widely beloved films include &quot;Late Spring&quot; (1949), &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953) and &quot;An Autumn Afternoon&quot; (1962).

Widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s greatest and most influential filmmakers, Ozu&#x27;s work has continued to receive acclaim since his death. In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; was voted the third-greatest film of all time by critics world-wide. In the same poll, &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; was voted the greatest film of all time by 358 directors and film-makers world-wide.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ozu was born in the Fukagawa district of Tokyo, the second son of merchant Toranosuke Ozu and his wife Asae. His family was a branch of the Ozu Yoemon merchant family from Ise, and Toranosuke was the 5th generation manager of the family&#x27;s fertilizer business in Nihonbashi. Asae came from the Nakajō merchant family. Ozu had five brothers and sisters. When he was three, he developed meningitis, and was in a coma for a couple of days. Asae devoted herself to nursing him, and Ozu made a recovery. He attended Meiji nursery school and primary school. In March 1913, at the age of nine, he and his siblings were sent by his father to live in his father&#x27;s home town of Matsusaka in Mie Prefecture, where he remained until 1924. In March 1916, at the age of 12, he entered what is now Ujiyamada High School. He was a boarder at the school and did judo. He frequently skipped classes to watch films such as &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; or &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;. In 1917, he saw the film &quot;Civilization&quot; and decided that he wanted to be a film director.

In 1920, at the age of 17, he was thrown out of the dormitory after being accused of writing a love letter to a good-looking boy in a lower class, and had to commute to school by train.

In March 1921, Ozu graduated from the high school. He attempted the exam for entrance into what is now Kobe University&#x27;s economics department, but failed. In 1922, he took the exam for a teacher training college, but failed it too. On 31 March 1922, he began working as a substitute teacher at a school in Mie prefecture. He is said to have traveled the long journey from the school in the mountains to watch films on the weekend. In December 1922, his family, with the exception of Ozu and his sister, moved back to Tokyo to live with his father. In March 1923, when his sister graduated, he also returned to live in Tokyo.

===Entering the film business===
With his uncle acting as intermediary, Ozu was hired by the Shochiku Film Company, as an assistant in the cinematography department, on 1 August 1923, against the wishes of his father. His family home was destroyed in the earthquake of 1923, but no members of his family were injured.

On 12 December 1924, Ozu started a year of military service. He finished his military service on 30 November 1925, leaving as a corporal.

In 1926, he became a third assistant director at Shochiku. In 1927, he was involved in a fracas where he punched another employee for jumping a queue at the studio cafeteria, and when called to the studio director&#x27;s office, used it as an opportunity to present a film script he had written. In September 1927, he was promoted to director in the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; (period film) department, and directed his first film, &quot;Sword of Penitence&quot;, which has since been lost. &quot;Sword of Penitence&quot; was written by Ozu, with a screenplay by Kogo Noda, who would become his co-writer for the rest of his career. On September 25, he was called up for service in the military reserves until November, which meant that the film had to be partly finished by another director.
In 1928, Shiro Kido, the head of the Shochiku studio, decided that the company would concentrate on making short comedy films without star actors. Ozu made many of these films. The film &quot;Body Beautiful&quot;, released on 1 December 1928, was the first Ozu film to use a low camera position, which would become his trademark. After a series of the &quot;no star&quot; pictures, in September 1929, Ozu&#x27;s first film with stars, &quot;I Graduated, But...&quot;, starring and Kinuyo Tanaka, was released. In January 1930, he was entrusted with Shochiku&#x27;s top star, Sumiko Kurishima, in her new year film, &quot;&quot;. His subsequent films of 1930 impressed Shiro Kido enough to invite Ozu on a trip to a hot spring. In his early works, Ozu used the pseudonym &quot;James Maki&quot; for his screenwriting credit. His film &quot;Young Miss&quot;, with an all-star cast, was the first time he used the pen name James Maki, and was also his first film to appear in film magazine &quot;Kinema Jumpo&quot; &quot;Best Ten&quot; at third position.

In 1932, his &quot;I Was Born, But...&quot;, a comedy about childhood with serious overtones, was received by movie critics as the first notable work of social criticism in Japanese cinema, winning Ozu wide acclaim.
In 1935, Ozu made a short documentary with a soundtrack: &quot;Kagami Jishi&quot;, in which Kikugoro VI performed a Kabuki dance of the same title. This was made by request of the Ministry of Education. Like the rest of Japan&#x27;s cinema industry, Ozu was slow to switch to the production of talkies: his first film with a dialogue sound-track was &quot;The Only Son&quot; in 1936, five years after Japan&#x27;s first talking film, Heinosuke Gosho&#x27;s &quot;The Neighbor&#x27;s Wife and Mine&quot;.

===Wartime===
On 9 September 1937, at a time when Shochiku was unhappy about Ozu&#x27;s lack of box-office success, despite the praise he received from critics, the thirty-four-year-old Ozu was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army. He spent two years in China in the Second Sino-Japanese War. He arrived in Shanghai on 27 September 1937 as part of an infantry regiment which handled chemical weapons. He started as a corporal, but was promoted to sergeant on 1 June 1938. From January until September 1938, he was stationed in Nanjing, where he met Sadao Yamanaka, who was stationed nearby. In September, Yamanaka died of illness. In 1939, Ozu was dispatched to Hankou, where he fought in the Battle of Nanchang and the Battle of Xiushui River. In June, he was ordered back to Japan, arriving in Kobe in July, and his conscription ended on 16 July 1939.

Some of Ozu&#x27;s published diaries cover his wartime experiences between 20 December 1938 and 5 June 1939. Another diary from his wartime years () he expressly forbade from publication. In the published diaries, reference to his group&#x27;s participation in chemical warfare (in violation of the Geneva Protocol, though Japan had withdrawn from the League of Nations in 1933) can be found, for example, in various entries from March 1939. In one passage, he reflects on the systemic manipulation of Chinese soldiers, comparing them to insects in a way that illustrates their perceived loss of individuality due to propaganda. Although operating as a military squad leader, Ozu retains his directorial perspective, once commenting that the initial shock and subsequent agony of a man as he is hacked to death is very much like its depiction in period films.

Ozu&#x27;s writings also offers a glimpse into the Japanese military&#x27;s use of comfort women. In a letter sent to friends in Japan on 11 April 1938, from Dingyuan County in China&#x27;s Anhui Province, Ozu writes about the comfort station protocol in lightly coded terms. In a 13 January 1939 diary entry, Ozu writes more openly about his group&#x27;s upcoming turn for use of a comfort station near Yingcheng. He mentions that two tickets, ointment and prophylatics are provided, and that three Korean and twelve Chinese women were being held at the comfort station for their use. Comfort station rates and schedules are also given by Ozu.

In 1939, he wrote the first draft of the script for &quot;The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice&quot;, but shelved it due to extensive changes insisted on by military censors. The first film Ozu made on his return was the critically and commercially successful &quot;Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family&quot;, released in 1941. He followed this with &quot;There Was a Father&quot; (&quot;Chichi Ariki&quot;, 1942), which explored the strong bonds of affection between a father and son despite years of separation.

In 1943, Ozu was again drafted into the army for the purpose of making a propaganda film in Burma. However, he was sent to Singapore instead, to make a documentary &quot;Derii e, Derii e&quot; (&quot;To Delhi, to Delhi&quot;) about Chandra Bose. During his time in Singapore, having little inclination to work, he spent an entire year reading, playing tennis and watching American films provided by the Army information corps. He was particularly impressed with Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. He occupied a fifth-floor room facing the sea in the Cathay Building where he entertained guests, drew pictures, and collected rugs. At the end of the Second World War, in August 1945, Ozu destroyed the script and all footage of the film. He was detained as a civilian, and worked in a rubber plantation. Of his film team of 32 people, there was only space for 28 on the first repatriation boat to Japan. Ozu won a lottery giving him a place, but gave it to someone else who was anxious to return.

===Postwar===
Ozu returned to Japan in February 1946, and moved back in with his mother, who had been staying with his sister in Noda in Chiba prefecture. He reported for work at the Ofuna studios on 18 February 1946. His first film released after the war was &quot;Record of a Tenement Gentleman&quot; in 1947. Around this time, the Chigasakikan Ryokan became Ozu&#x27;s favoured location for scriptwriting.

&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; was the last script that Ozu wrote at Chigasakikan. In later years, Ozu and Noda used a small house in the mountains at Tateshina in Nagano Prefecture called Unkosō to write scripts, with Ozu staying in a nearby house called Mugeisō.

Ozu&#x27;s films from the late 1940s onward were favourably received, and the entries in the so-called &quot;Noriko trilogy&quot; (starring Setsuko Hara) of &quot;Late Spring&quot; (1949), &quot;Early Summer&quot; (1951) and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953) are among his most acclaimed works, with &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; widely considered his masterpiece. &quot;Late Spring&quot;, the first of these films, was the beginning of Ozu&#x27;s commercial success and the development of his cinematography and storytelling style. These three films were followed by his first colour film, &quot;Equinox Flower,&quot; in 1958, &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; in 1959 and &quot;Late Autumn&quot; in 1960. In addition to Noda, other regular collaborators included cinematographer Yuharu Atsuta, along with the actors Chishū Ryū, Setsuko Hara and Haruko Sugimura.

His work was only rarely shown overseas before the 1960s; however, &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; gained recognition after winning the Sutherland Trophy at the 1958 London Film Festival. Ozu&#x27;s last film was &quot;An Autumn Afternoon,&quot; which was released in 1962.

He served as president of the Directors Guild of Japan from 1955 until his death in 1963. In 1959 he became the first recipient from the field of cinema to win the Japan Art Academy Prize.

Ozu was known for his drinking. He and Noda measured the progression of their scripts by how many bottles of sake they had drunk. Ozu never married. He lived with his mother until she died in 1961.

A heavy smoker, Ozu died of throat cancer in 1963 on his sixtieth birthday. The grave he shares with his mother at Engaku-ji in Kamakura bears no name—just the character &quot;mu&quot; (&quot;nothingness&quot;).

==Legacy and style==
Ozu is probably as well known for the technical style and innovation of his films as for the narrative content. The style of his films is most striking in his later films, a style he had not fully developed until his post-war sound films. He did not conform to Hollywood conventions. Rather than using the typical over-the-shoulder shots in his dialogue scenes by most directors, the camera gazes on the actors directly, which has the effect of placing the viewer in the middle of the scene. Throughout his career, Ozu used a 50mm lens, which is usually considered to be the lens closest to human vision.

Ozu did not use typical transitions between scenes. In between scenes he would show shots of certain static objects as transitions, or use direct cuts, rather than fades or dissolves. Most often the static objects would be buildings, where the next indoor scene would take place. It was during these transitions that he would use music, which might begin at the end of one scene, progress through the static transition, and fade into the new scene. He rarely used non-diegetic music in any scenes other than in the transitions. Ozu moved the camera less and less as his career progressed, and ceased using tracking shots altogether in his colour films. However, David Bordwell argues that Ozu is one of the few directors to &quot;create a systematic alternative to Hollywood continuity cinema, but he does so by changing only a few premises.&quot;

Ozu invented the &quot;tatami shot&quot;, in which the camera is placed at a low height, supposedly at the eye level of a person kneeling on a &quot;tatami&quot; mat. Actually, Ozu&#x27;s camera is often even lower than that, only one or two feet off the ground, which necessitated the use of special tripods and raised sets. He used this low height even when there were no sitting scenes, such as when his characters walked in hallways. When Ozu made his move to colour, he chose to shoot under the German colour process Agfacolor, as he felt that it captured reds much better than any other colour process.
Ozu eschewed the traditional rules of movie storytelling, most notably eyelines. In his review of &quot;Floating Weeds&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert recounts:[Ozu] once had a young assistant who suggested that perhaps he should shoot conversations so that it seemed to the audience that the characters were looking at one another. Ozu agreed to a test. They shot a scene both ways, and compared them. &quot;You see?&quot; Ozu said. &quot;No difference!&quot;

Ozu was also an innovator in Japanese narrative structure through his use of ellipses, or the decision not to depict major events in the story. In &quot;An Autumn Afternoon&quot; (1962), for example, a wedding is merely mentioned in one scene, and the next sequence references this wedding (which has already occurred); the wedding itself is never shown. This is typical of Ozu&#x27;s films, which eschew melodrama by eliding moments that would often be used in Hollywood in attempts to stir an emotional reaction from audiences.

Ozu became recognized internationally when his films were shown abroad. Influential monographs by Donald Richie, Paul Schrader, and David Bordwell have ensured a wide appreciation of Ozu&#x27;s style, aesthetics, and themes by the Anglophonic audience.

==Tributes and documentaries==
&quot;Five&quot;, also known as &quot;Five Dedicated to Ozu&quot;, is an Iranian documentary film directed by Abbas Kiarostami. The film consists of five long takes set by the ocean. 
Five sequences: 1) A piece of driftwood on the seashore, carried about by the waves 2) People walking on the seashore. The oldest ones stop by, look at the sea, then go away 3) Blurry shapes on a winter beach. A herd of dogs. A love story 4) A group of loud ducks cross the image, in one direction then the other 5) A pond, at night. Frogs improvising a concert. A storm, then the sunrise.

In 2003, the centenary of Ozu&#x27;s birth was commemorated at various film festivals around the world. Shochiku produced the film &quot;Café Lumière&quot; (珈琲時光), directed by Taiwanese film-maker Hou Hsiao-hsien as homage to Ozu, with direct reference to the late master&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953), to premiere on Ozu&#x27;s birthday.

Ozu was voted the tenth greatest director of all time in the 2002 British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of critics&#x27; top 10 directors. Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; has appeared several times in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of best films selected by critics and directors. In 2012, it topped the poll of film directors&#x27; choices of &quot;greatest film of all time&quot;. Ozu was one of film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s favourite filmmakers, who described him as the most humanistic director of all time.

In 2013, director Yoji Yamada of the &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot; film series remade &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; in a modern setting as &quot;Tokyo Family&quot;.

In the Wim Wenders documentary film &quot;Tokyo-Ga&quot;, the director travels to Japan to explore the world of Ozu, interviewing both Chishū Ryū and Yuharu Atsuta.

In 2023, &quot;OZU: Ozu Yasujirō ga Kaita Monogatari&quot; (OZU～小津安二郎が描いた物語～), a 2023 television series based on Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s several films premiered.

<text>Dorset is a town in Bennington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,133 at the 2020 census. Dorset is famous for being the location of Cephas Kent&#x27;s Inn, where four meetings of the Convention that signed the Dorset Accords led to the independent Vermont Republic and future statehood. Dorset is the site of America&#x27;s oldest marble quarry and is the birthplace of Bill W., co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. East Dorset is the site of the Wilson House and the Griffith Library. The town is named after the English county of Dorset.

The East Dorset marble quarry had been established by Bill W.&#x27;s great grandfather and stayed in the family for three generations. Marble from these quarries provided stone for the New York Public Library Main Branch building in New York City. The quarry closed and during the summer months serves as a popular swimming hole.

The Dorset town center is defined as the Dorset census-designated place and had a population of 249 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Through a series of treaties, native tribes had surrendered title to large areas of land. Subsequently, the Provincial Governor of New Hampshire had provided land grants west of the Connecticut River in land that was also claimed by the Province of New York. Strife was created by New York attempting to enforce its legitimate claim to government on settlers who had in good faith purchased land titles from New Hampshire. The King upon the advice of the Privy Council decreed a settlement that was not followed by the Governor and Legislature of New York.

Sandwiched between New York and New Hampshire, the area was constantly in dispute and claimed by both. New York claimed it was included in its 1664 grant from Charles II, but had made no effort to settle it. New Hampshire, desiring to expand its frontier to the west, simply expropriated the land and proceeded to grant 131 charters in the territory, which then became known as the New Hampshire Grants. New York retaliated by declaring the Grants null and void and telling the settlers they would have to repurchase the land from New York (at a much higher price) if they wished to stay. The New Hampshire Grantees countered by organizing the &quot;Green Mountain Boys&quot;, an informal alliance of civilian soldiers who successfully prevented the settlers from being evicted.

To protect their investments in the land and improvements, and the health and security of their families, farms and towns, the people of the New Hampshire Grants formed Committees of Safety to coordinate protection of their society. These committees predated those of the 13 colonies formed to protect themselves from the crown by eight years, yet had precedents in similar organizations during the French and Indian War.

Born in Connecticut, Cephas Kent moved himself and his family to Dorset in 1773. He was a deacon in a local church. He owned and operated a small tavern, destined to play a part in Vermont&#x27;s history. By 1775, the land control controversy had reached the point that the Grantees decided to take official action, and they held a general convention in Cephas Kent&#x27;s tavern. Matters discussed at that meeting were not limited to their internal affairs but also included the general cause of American independence. The Continental Congress had voted to pay the Green Mountain Boys for their services and had asked that a regiment be formed in the New Hampshire Grants. The Grantees wanted to join in the general rebellion but not as a part of New Hampshire and certainly not as a part of New York. So they petitioned the Continental Congress to intervene in their behalf against New York and permit the Grantees to serve independently in the war of rebellion.

The Grantees met three more times during the course of the next year, always in Cephas Kent&#x27;s tavern, and on June 25, 1776, voted &quot;that application be made to the inhabitants of said Grants to form the same into a separate district.&quot; Later that day the convention bound itself &quot;to defend by arms the United American States against the hostile attempts of the British fleet and armies until the present unhappy controversy between the two countries shall be settled.&quot; This was the first official step toward Vermont&#x27;s independence.

Thus, the future state of Vermont was underway. The town of Windsor claims to be the birthplace of Vermont, and, indeed, it was there, on July 2, 1777, that the constitution was adopted and the name chosen. But it was in Dorset at Cephas Kent&#x27;s tavern that the idea of Vermont was born; and, as Zephine Humphrey put it, &quot;The idea is the dynamic reality and the fact its shadow.&quot; In 1790, New York finally relinquished her claims and, on February 18, 1791, Congress admitted Vermont as the fourteenth state. In 1912 the Vermont Society of Colonial Dames erected an historical marker at the site of the Cephas Kent Inn in Dorset.

The agreements made at Cephas Kent&#x27;s tavern are commonly known as the Dorset Accords.

==Geography==
Dorset is located along the northern border of Bennington County, with Rutland County on the north. The Taconic Mountains occupy the central and western 3/4 of the town, with the Valley of Vermont on the east side of town separating the Taconics from the Green Mountains to the east. The communities of East Dorset, Freedleyville, and North Dorset are all in the Valley of Vermont, along U.S. Route 7, as is Emerald Lake State Park. Dorset and South Dorset are located in the western and southern parts of the town, respectively, along Vermont Route 30 in a valley between two portions of the Taconic Range. Mount Aeolus is located in the southern part of the town between South Dorset and East Dorset. Dorset Mountain rises in the northern part of the town, with its summit (Dorset Peak) located just north of the town line in Danby. A subsidiary peak is located in Dorset proper.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.27%, is water. The height of land in the Valley of Vermont between the Hudson River and Lake Champlain watersheds is located in Dorset. The Batten Kill rises just north of East Dorset and flows south into Manchester, then west to the Hudson in New York. The Otter Creek, one of the longest rivers entirely in Vermont, rises a short distance north of the Batten Kill&#x27;s source and flows north through Emerald Lake and into Rutland County, eventually reaching Lake Champlain north of Vergennes.

<doc id="137244" wikidata="Q968879" url="?curid=137244" title="Glastenbury, Vermont">
<text>Glastenbury is a town in Bennington County, Vermont, United States. The town was unincorporated by an act of the state legislature in 1937. The population was 9 at the 2020 census. Along with Somerset, Glastenbury is one of two Vermont towns where the population levels have dropped so low that the town has been unincorporated. The town has no local government and the town&#x27;s affairs are handled by a state-appointed supervisor.

==Geography==
Glastenbury is located in central Bennington County and is bordered by the town of Sunderland to the north, Shaftsbury to the west, Woodford to the south, and Somerset in Windham County to the east. Most of the town is part of the Green Mountain National Forest. The highest point in town, near the town&#x27;s geographic center, is Glastenbury Mountain. The Long Trail and Appalachian Trail traverse the town from its north to south border, following the crest of the Green Mountains.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Glastenbury was first chartered in 1761 by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth, but settlers did not begin trickling into this rocky, forbidding mountainous area for some years after. At the time of Vermont&#x27;s first census as a new state in 1791, only six families inhabited it. These first settlers found life on Glastenbury Mountain difficult, as would residents ever after, and by 1800 they had been replaced by eight entirely different families. Of these eight, only three would stay on until the next census ten years later, and only one of these would remain in later decades.

Despite the many hardships that greeted Glastenbury settlers, newcomers continued to arrive in small numbers, and the population grew slowly to 76 in 1810. But the years following 1810 were hard ones for all of Vermont, and by 1840 there were only 53 left in Glastenbury. After the Civil War, Glastenbury finally began to experience more rapid growth. Business interests in nearby Bennington were eager to take advantage of the vast timber resources there, and by 1872 had finally begun construction on a railroad (trolley) which ran up the mountain. The line ran along Bolles Brook and terminated at the place where the brook forked. It was an improbable achievement, with some parts of the line climbing as much as in altitude per mile. Remains of the old trolley tracks can still be seen today.

Meanwhile, the population had grown to 199 in 1870, and to 241 in 1880. This includes only the enumerated population; there were many more transient workers who were drawn to the mountain to work in the then-booming logging business. Two additional sawmills were built in the 1870s, one at the original settlement, called Fayville, and one at the new settlement at the railroad terminus, which became known as South Glastenbury. Dozens of kilns were built at South Glastenbury for converting the lumber to charcoal; at this time Glastenbury was one of the three foremost sites in Vermont for producing the charcoal which was feeding iron production in nearby Shaftsbury and in Troy, New York.

By the late 1880s, however, the mountain had been cleared of nearly all of its mature trees, and the town&#x27;s economy dipped dramatically. In 1889 the railroad operation ceased. It was revived briefly in 1894 as an electric passenger trolley run by the Bennington &amp; Woodford Railroad, and a brief and initially promising effort was made to convert South Glastenbury to a tourist attraction. A small fortune was spent to convert the area into a mountain resort area which opened in the summer of 1898, but a freshet wiped out the railroad tracks that winter, marking the beginning of the end of Glastenbury as a functioning town. Population dwindled in the early twentieth century, down to only seven in 1937, when the legislature unincorporated the town.

==Demographics==

<text>Pownal is a town in Bennington County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 3,258. The town of Pownal includes the villages of Pownal, North Pownal, and Pownal Center.

==History==

During the Woodland period, the area was settled by the Mahican people, with others, such as the Mohawks, traveling across it. By the late 17th century, Europeans may have entered the area as a result of the establishment of the Dutch patroonship owned by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, which extended west and east out of Albany and the fur trading community of Beverwyck. The southwestern corner of Pownal was part of the patroonship. Rensselaerswyck passed into English control in 1664. The first European settlers may have entered the area in the 1730s. Those settlers may have been Dutch or other Europeans who leased land within Rensselaerwyck. On January 28, 1760, New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth chartered Pownal, which he named after his fellow royal governor, Thomas Pownall of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

Thereafter, settlers, primarily of English descent, began to arrive from Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1766, 185 male heads of households in Pownal sent a petition to George III, asking that their land claims be recognized and that the fees required to do so be waived. Since Wentworth had granted to settlers land that the Province of New York also claimed, legal and physical conflicts broke out between &quot;Yorkers&quot; and settlers in the New Hampshire Grants (or &quot;The Grants&quot;). As a result, a number of Pownal residents joined the Green Mountain Boys under Ethan Allen.

By the American Revolution, the town was deeply divided between &quot;Yankees&quot; and the Tories, those sympathetic to England, each of whom considered himself or herself a Loyalist. Tories were often arrested and imprisoned.

These tensions were strong enough that when British General John Burgoyne&#x27;s Saratoga campaign brought conflict to the area, Vermonters fought on both sides. William Card, originally of Rhode Island, fought for the British at the Battle of Bennington along with four of his sons: Jonathan, Elisha, Philo (or possible Peleg), and Stephen. The battle, a virtually complete American victory, resulted in the capture of the elder Card and all four of his sons, but they were soon released. Three years later, William Card&#x27;s grandsons Thomas and Jonathan would serve in a Vermont Patriot regiment.
By the end of the Revolution, most Tories had fled Pownal for safety among the United Empire Loyalists who resettled in Canada. The novel &quot;Memoir of a Green Mountain Boy&quot; starts and ends in Pownal during the early years of the Revolution.
The oldest house in both Pownal and Vermont is the Mooar-Wright House, possibly built in the 1750s. Some think it may have been built by John Defoe (or DeVoet), a Tory who was imprisoned in 1776, escaped, fought on the side of the British and Hessian forces at the Battle of Bennington, was captured, escaped again, and settled in Canada. Others believe the Mooar-Wright house was built by Charles Wright in 1765.

Pownal citizens have long prided themselves on their independent spirit. In 1789, a touring minister, the Rev. Nathan Perkins, described the town this way: &quot; ... Pawnal ye first town, poor land – very unpleasant – very uneven – miserable set of inhabitants – no religion, Rhode Island haters of religion – Baptists, quakers, &amp; some Presbyterians – no meeting house.&quot;

Today Pownal has five churches. The oldest church, Pownal Center Community Church, was organized in 1794 as the Union Church, serving both Baptists and Methodists, and open to any denomination. The first church was a log structure. It was replaced in 1849 by the present church, jointly owned by the town and church. This church has a unique history as it was deeded to the Town and three members of the church as part of gleebe lands by the King of England. 
In 1851, Chester Arthur (later to become President of the United States), was appointed principal to an academy for boys. The academy prepared boys for college (and became the foundation for Arthur&#x27;s future path to study law). Future President James Garfield also taught in North Pownal.

Both cotton mills and woolen mills operated during the 19th century. The wool industry reached its peak between 1820 and 1840, though farmers continued to raise sheep until the 20th century. On the Hoosic River in North Pownal, an 18th-century gristmill was replaced by a woolen mill that operated from 1849 until 1863, when it burned. The Plunkett &amp; Barber Co. Mill, built in 1866, served as a cotton mill until 1930, becoming a tannery in 1937. It closed in 1988. Remediated as a Superfund site, the mill site is planned to become a recreation area.

During the early part of the 20th century, muckraking photographer, Lewis Hine, took a photograph of twelve-year-old Addie Card working in the mills, which Hine labeled as, &quot;Anemic Little Spinner in North Pownal Cotton Mill, North Pownal, Vermont, August 1910&quot;. This photograph was featured on a U.S. stamp commemorating the passage of the first child labor laws (see the Keating–Owen Act). Elizabeth Winthrop has written a novel, &quot;Counting on Grace&quot;, inspired by Card&#x27;s photograph and life.

The Berkshire Street Railway Company began trolley service from Williamstown to Bennington via Pownal on June 27, 1907. Service was discontinued in 1927. The brick power station still stands along Route 7.

Lime quarries operated in North Pownal until 1936. A rail car line extended from the southernmost quarry to the mill on the west side of Route 346, where the stone was crushed and packaged for shipment.

The Green Mountain Race Track opened in 1963. The track offered both thoroughbred and standardbred horse racing until 1977, and greyhound racing from 1976 to 1992. Since closing as a racetrack, the site has hosted live events occasionally, including a rock concert in the Lollapalooza series in 1996, and antique car shows from 2005 to 2008. As of April 2022, the racetrack appears to be unused and fallen into disrepair.

===Camp Ilium===

The YMCA&#x27;s Camp Ilium was in Pownal. Ilium is notable because on September 10, 1910, S. F. Lester of Troy, New York, became the first person to hold the Scouting leadership position of Scoutmaster (approved by the BSA). He received his certification from the BSA headquarters in New York City. In 1910 he led a group of 30 scouts to the camp. Camp Ilium was the starting point of the Boy Scout Movement for Pownal and Troy, New York.

The town also has the hamlets of West Rupert (on VT 153) and North Rupert (on VT 30).

==History==
Many historians agree that Benning Wentworth, colonial governor of New Hampshire, gave Rupert its name, after Prince Rupert of the Rhine (1619–1682). Prince Rupert was a prominent figure in the English Civil War and afterwards.

One of Rupert&#x27;s first settlers was Reuben Harmon, a metalsmith, who was given the right to mint coins, called Vermont coppers, for the Republic of Vermont. Harmon&#x27;s Mint was originally located in East Rupert on a small stream known as Hagar&#x27;s Brook. It was later moved Southwind Farm in North Rupert. 
Rupert is the filming location for seasons 1-10 of the syndicated PBS cooking show &quot;Cook&#x27;s Country&quot;. The iconic white country house, known as Carver House, is located near the center of town on the corner of Rupert Avenue and West Pawlett Road across the road from the Rupert Methodist Church. Christopher Kimball, former Executive Producer and Host of &quot;Cook&#x27;s Country&quot;, maintains a residence nearby.

<doc id="137261" wikidata="Q808466" url="?curid=137261" title="Barnet, Vermont">
<text>Barnet is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,663 at the 2020 census. Barnet contains the locations of Barnet Center, East Barnet, McIndoe Falls, Mosquitoville, Passumpsic and West Barnet. The main settlement of Barnet is recorded as a census-designated place by the U.S. Census Bureau, with a population of 127 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town of Barnet, Vermont, originally took its name from the town of Barnet, England.

On September 16, 1763, the town received its charter from the royal governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth.

The first European descendants to work the land and stay in the town were three brothers, Daniel, Jacob, and Elijah Hall, along with Jonathan Fowler. Their homestead was built along the Connecticut River and to the north near McIndoe Falls. Elijah Hall built the first house in Caledonia County in Barnet, near the base of Stevens Falls. Colonel Alexander Harvey came from Dundee, Scotland, for those in the town who wished to find new land in the American colonies. Despite losing contact with almost all of them after the American Revolution broke out, he decided to stay, claiming of land and a lake, now known as Harvey&#x27;s Lake.

The five early villages within the town of Barnet were:
* Barnet village (formerly called Stevens Village) located at the falls in the river
* McIndoe Falls (also referred to as McIndoes) near the southeast corner of the town lying along a terrace at the falls
* Passumpsic village (formerly called Kendall&#x27;s Mills) in the northeast part of the town and spreading into the adjoining town of Waterford
* East Barnet (in 1875 named Norrisville), near the mouth of the river just before it enters the deep gorge
* West Barnet at the outlet of Harvey Lake, on the road from Barnet village to Peacham.

Additional hamlets that have arisen within the town are:
* Mosquitoville, located south of Harvey Lake
* Barnet Center, on the road from Barnet village to West Barnet.

The main settlement of Barnet village has grown in population and is often referred to as &quot;the town&quot;, yet the town itself includes the populated places listed above.

Two governors of the state of Vermont were from Barnet: Erastus Fairbanks, who served two terms from 1852–1853 and 1860–1861, and his son, Horace Fairbanks, who served from 1876 to 1878. The Fairbanks family left Barnet for nearby St. Johnsbury, where they were known for manufacturing the first platform scale.

Ocean explorer and scuba inventor Jacques Cousteau had influential experiences on Harvey&#x27;s Lake as a young boy in the early 1920s. While attending a summer camp he experimented with staying underwater by breathing through hollow reeds found in the lake shallows. Though he could not yet swim well, this allowed him to stay underwater for extended periods.

===Religion===
====Christianity====
On January 24, 1784, the town of Barnet voted unanimously to make the Presbyterian denomination the official one of the town, as it was &quot;founded on the word of God as expressed in the Confession of Faith, Catechisms Longer and Shorter, with the form of church government agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, and practiced by the Church of Scotland.&quot;

The Passumpsic Calvinistic Baptist church was first created by a council of neighboring churches on July 1, 1812. The village of Passumpsic was chosen due to its centralized location.

The First Congregational Church of Barnet was created by Reverend David Sutherland in September 1829 after a new brick church had been built. Its first permanent minister was the Reverend Henry Fairbanks. The church which stands now was constructed in 1854.

The earliest Reformed Presbyterian Church in Vermont was organized in Ryegate in October 1798. In the early part of the nineteenth century, a group of members in Barnet built a new meeting house on the land formerly owned by Walter Harvey, and the property has gone by that name since then. The longest-tenured minister was Daniel C. Faris, who served the congregation from 1873 until 1923. The congregation&#x27;s Barnet branch became a separate congregation on July 9, 1872, and it continued until disorganization in 1970.

====Buddhism====

In 1970, upon his arrival in North America, Chögyam Trungpa established the teaching center &quot;Tail of the Tiger&quot; (now Karmê Chöling). It was consolidated with others in Colorado in 1973.

<text>Ludwigslust is a former &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the southwest of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from the north clockwise) Nordwestmecklenburg, the district-free city Schwerin, Parchim, Prignitz in Brandenburg, Lüchow-Dannenberg and Lüneburg in Lower Saxony and the district Lauenburg in Schleswig-Holstein. The district was disbanded at the district reform of September 2011. Its territory has been part of the Ludwigslust-Parchim district since.

==Geography==
The district was situated roughly between the river Elbe and the city of Schwerin. Before the 2011 district reform, it was the largest district of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but very sparsely populated.

==History==
After the German reunification the two districts of Hagenow and Ludwigslust were established. In 1994 both together, with the two Ämter of Rastow and Stralendorf from the district of Schwerin-Land, were merged to an enlarged district of Ludwigslust. This district was merged with the district of Parchim at the district reform of September 2011, forming the new Ludwigslust-Parchim district.

<doc id="137264" wikidata="Q211785" url="?curid=137264" title="Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin">
<text>Mikhail Yevgrafovich Saltykov-Shchedrin (; – ), born Mikhail Yevgrafovich Saltykov and known during his lifetime by the pen name Nikolai Shchedrin (), was a major Russian writer and satirist of the 19th century. He spent most of his life working as a civil servant in various capacities. After the death of poet Nikolay Nekrasov, he acted as editor of a Russian literary magazine &quot;Otechestvenniye Zapiski&quot; until the Tsarist government banned it in 1884. In his works Saltykov mastered both stark realism and satirical grotesque merged with fantasy. His most famous works, the family chronicle novel &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot; (1880) and the novel &quot;The History of a Town&quot; (1870), also translated as &quot;Foolsburg&quot;, became important works of 19th-century fiction, and Saltykov is regarded as a major figure of Russian literary Realism.

==Biography==
Mikhail Saltykov was born on 27 January 1826 in the village of Spas-Ugol (modern-day Taldomsky District of the Moscow Oblast of Russia) as one of the eight children (five brothers and three sisters) in the large Russian noble family of Yevgraf Vasilievich Saltykov (1776–1851) and Olga Mikhaylovna Saltykova (née Zabelina; 1801–74). His father belonged to an ancient Saltykov noble house that originated as one of the branches of the Morozov boyar family. According to the Velvet Book, it was founded by Mikhail Ignatievich Morozov nicknamed Saltyk (from the Old Church Slavonic word &quot;saltyk&quot; meaning &quot;one&#x27;s own way/taste&quot;), the son of Ignaty Mikhailovich Morozov and a great-grandson of the founder of the dynasty Ivan Semyonovich Moroz who lived during the 14–15th centuries. The Saltykov family also shared the Polish Sołtyk coat of arms. It gave birth to many important political figures throughout history, including the tsaritsa of Russia Praskovia Saltykova and her daughter, the Empress of Russia Anna Ioannovna.

Saltykov&#x27;s mother was an heir to a rich Moscow merchant of the 1st level guild Mikhail Petrovich Zabelin whose ancestors belonged to the so-called trading peasants and who was granted hereditary nobility for his handsome donation to the army needs in 1812; his wife Marfa Ivanovna Zabelina also came from wealthy Moscow merchants. At the time of Mikhail Saltykov&#x27;s birth, Yevgraf was fifty years old, while Olga was twenty five. Mikhail spent his early years on his parents&#x27; large estate in Spasskoye on the border of the Tver and Yaroslavl governorates, in the Poshekhonye region.

&quot;In my childhood and teenage years I witnessed serfdom at its worst. It saturated all strata of social life, not just the landlords and the enslaved masses, degrading all classes, privileged or otherwise, with its atmosphere of a total lack of rights, when fraud and trickery were the order of the day, and there was an all-pervading fear of being crushed and destroyed at any moment,&quot; he remembered, speaking through one of the characters of his later novel &quot;Old Years in Poshekhonye&quot;. Life in the Saltykov family was equally difficult. Dominating the weak, religious father was despotic mother whose intimidating persona horrified the servants and her own children. This atmosphere was later recreated in Shchedrin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot;, and the idea of &quot;the devastating effect of legalized slavery upon the human psyche&quot; would become one of the prominent motifs of his prose. Olga Mikhaylovna, though, was a woman of many talents; having perceived some in Mikhail, she treated him as her favorite.

The Saltykovs often quarreled; they gave their children neither love nor care and Mikhail, despite enjoying relative freedom in the house, remembered feeling lonely and neglected. Another thing Saltykov later regretted was his having been completely shut out from nature in his early years: the children lived in the main house and were rarely allowed to go out, knowing their &quot;animals and birds only as boiled and fried.&quot; Characteristically, there were few descriptions of nature in the author&#x27;s works.

===Education===

Mikhail&#x27;s early education was desultory, but, being an extraordinarily perceptive boy, by the age of six he spoke French and German fluently. He was taught to read and write Russian by the serf painter Pavel Sokolov and a local clergyman, and became an avid reader, later citing the Gospel, which he read at the age of eight, as a major influence. Among his childhood friends was Sergey Yuriev, the son of a neighbouring landlord and later a prominent literary figure, editor and publisher of the magazines &quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot; and &quot;Beseda&quot;. In 1834 his elder sister Nadezhda graduated from the Moscow Ekaterininsky college, and Mikhail&#x27;s education from then on was the prerogative of her friend Avdotya Vasilevskaya, a graduate of the same institute who had been invited to the house as a governess. Mikhail&#x27;s other tutors included the local clergyman Ivan Vasilievich who taught the boy Latin and the student Matvey Salmin.

At the age of ten Saltykov joined the third class of the Moscow Institute for sons of the nobility (Dvoryansky institute), skipping the first two classes, where he studied until 1838. He then enrolled in the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in Saint Petersburg, spending the next six years there. Prince Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, afterwards the Minister Of Foreign Affairs, was one of his schoolfellows. In the lyceum the quality of education was poor. &quot;The information taught to us was scant, sporadic and all but meaningless… It was not so much an education as such, but a part of social privilege, the one that draws the line through life: above are you and me, people of leisure and power, beneath – just one single word: muzhik,&quot; Saltykov wrote in his &quot;Letters to Auntie&quot;.

While at the lyceum Saltykov started writing poetry and translated works from Lord Byron and Heinrich Heine. He was proclaimed an &#x27;heir to Pushkin&#x27; – after the local tradition which demanded that each course should have one. His first poem, &quot;The Lyre&quot;, a hymn to the great Russian poet, was published by &quot;Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya&quot; in 1841. Eight more of Saltykov&#x27;s verses made their way into &quot;Sovremennik&quot; in 1844–45. At the time he was attending Mikhail Yazykov&#x27;s literary circle, which was occasionally visited by Vissarion Belinsky. The latter&#x27;s articles and essays made a great impression on Mikhail.

Upon graduating the Lyceum in 1844, Saltykov, who was one of the best students, was promoted directly to the chancellery of the Ministry of Defense. This success upset Mikhail, as it ended his dream of attending Saint Petersburg University. The same year he became involved with &quot;Otechestvennye zapiski&quot; and &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, reviewing for both magazines children&#x27;s literature and textbooks. His criticism was sharp, and Belinsky&#x27;s influence on it was evident. At this time Saltykov became a follower of the Socialist ideas coming from France. &quot;Brought up by Belinsky&#x27;s articles, I naturally drifted towards the Westernizers&#x27; camp, but not to the major trend of it which was dominant in Russian literature at the time, promoting German philosophy, but to this tiny circle that felt instinctively drawn towards France - the country of Saint-Simon, Fourier... and, in particular, George Sand... Such sympathies only grew stronger after 1848,&quot; he later remembered. Saltykov befriended literary critic Valerian Maykov and economist and publicist Vladimir Milyutin, and became close to the Petrashevsky circle. &quot;How easily we lived and what deep faith we had in the future, what single-mindedness and unity of hopes there was, giving us life!&quot; he later remembered, calling Mikhail Petrashevsky &quot;a dear, unforgettable friend and teacher.&quot;

===Literary career===

In 1847 Saltykov debuted with his first novella &quot;Contradictions&quot; (under the pseudonym M.Nepanov), the title referring to the piece&#x27;s main motif: the contrast between one&#x27;s noble ideals and the horrors of real life. It was followed by &quot;A Complicated Affair&quot; (1848), a social novella, reminiscent of Gogol, both in its plotlines and the natures of its characters, dealing with social injustice and the inability of an individual to cope with social issues. The novella was praised by Nikolai Dobrolyubov who wrote: &quot;It is full of heartfelt sympathy for destitute men... awakening in one humane feelings and manly thoughts,&quot; and Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who referred to it as a book &quot;that has created a stir and is of much interest to people of the new generation.&quot; It was the publication of &quot;Contradictions&quot; that caused Saltykov&#x27;s banishment to Vyatka, - apparently the result of overreaction from the authorities in response to the French Revolution of 1848. On 26 April 1848, Tsar Nicholas I signed the order for the author&#x27;s arrest and deportation.

In his first few months of exile Saltykov was mainly occupied with copying official documents. Then he was made a special envoy of the Vyatka governor; his major duty in this capacity was making inquiries concerning brawls, cases of minor bribery, embezzlement and police misdoings. Saltykov made desperate attempts to break free from what he called his &#x27;Vyatka captivity&#x27;, but after each of his requests he received the standard reply: &quot;would be premature.&quot; He became more and more aware of the possibility that he&#x27;d have to spend the rest of his life there. &quot;The very thought of that is so repellent that it makes by hair bristle,&quot; he complained in a letter to his brother. It helped that the local elite treated Saltykov with great warmth and sympathy; he was made a welcome guest in many respectable houses, including that of vice-governor Boltin whose daughter Elizaveta Apollonovna later became Saltykov&#x27;s wife.

While in Vyatka Saltykov got carried away by the idea of radically improving the quality of education for young women and girls. There were no decent history textbooks at the time in Russia, so he decided to write one himself. Called &quot;A Brief History of Russia&quot;, it amounted to 40 handwritten pages of compact text compiled from numerous sources. He worked on it while on vacation in a village near Tver, sending it to Vyatka to be published as a series.

As the numerous members of the Petrashevsky Circle were arrested in 1848, Saltykov got summoned to the capital to give evidence on his involvement in the group&#x27;s activity. There he managed to convince the authorities that &#x27;spreading harm&#x27; was not his intention and safely returned to Vyatka. In the summer of 1850 he became a councillor of the local government which implied long voyages through the province on official business, many of them having to do with issues concerning the Old Believers. As an investigator, he traveled throughout the Vyatka, Perm, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Yaroslavl governorates. In 1850 he became the organizer of the Vyatka agricultural exhibition, one of the largest in the country. All this provided Saltykov with priceless material for his future satires.

====&quot;Provincial Sketches&quot;====

In 1855 Tzar Nicholas I died and the climate in the country instantly changed. In November 1855 Saltykov received the permission to leave Vyatka, the new governor Lanskoy rumoured to be the major assisting force behind this. In January 1856 the writer returned to Saint Petersburg and in February was assigned to the Interior Ministry. By this time many of the stories and essays that would be known as &quot;Provincial Sketches&quot; have been written, a series of narratives about the fictitious town of Krutogorsk, shown as a symbol of Russian serfdom. Ivan Turgenev who happened to read them first was unimpressed and, following his advice (and bearing in mind still fierce censorship) Nikolai Nekrasov refused to publish the work in &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. In August 1856 Mikhail Katkov’s &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; started publishing &quot;Provincial Sketches&quot;, signed N.Shchedrin. The book, charged with anti-serfdom pathos and full of scathing criticism of provincial bureaucracy became instant success and made Saltykov famous. Many critics and colleagues called him the heir to Nikolai Gogol. &quot;I’m in awe... Oh immortal Gogol, you must now be a happy man now to see such a genius emerging as your follower,&quot; Taras Shevchenko wrote in his diary. In 1857 &quot;Sovremennik&quot; at last reacted: both Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky rather belatedly praised Saltykov, characteristically, imparting to his work what it&#x27;s never had: &quot;aiming at the undermining the Empire&#x27;s foundations.&quot;

In 1857 &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; published &quot;Pazukhin&#x27;s Death&quot;, a play which was quite in tune with &quot;Provincial Sketches&quot;. The production of it was banned with characteristic verdict of censors: &quot;Characters presented there are set to prove our society lies in the state of total moral devastation.&quot; Another of Saltykov&#x27;s plays, &quot;Shadows&quot; (1862–1865), about careerism and immorality of bureaucracy, has been discovered in archives and published only in 1914, when it was premiered on stage too.

Contrary to left radicals&#x27; attempt to draw Saltykov closer to their camp, &quot;undermining the Empire&#x27;s foundations&quot; was not his aim at all and on his return to Saint Petersburg he was soon promoted to administrative posts of considerable importance. His belief was that &quot;all honest men should help the government in defeating serfdom apologist still clinging to their rights.&quot; Huge literary success has never made him think of retiring from work in the government. Partly reasons for his return to the state service were practical. In 1856 Saltykov married Elizaveta Boltina, daughter of a Vyatka vice-governor and found, on the one hand, his mother&#x27;s financial support curtailed, on the other, his own needs rose sharply. Up until 1858 Saltykov continued working in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Then after making a report on the condition of the Russian police, he was appointed deputy governor of Ryazan where later he received the nickname &quot;the vice-Robespierre&quot;. On April 15, 1858, Saltykov arrived to Ryazan very informally, in an ordinary road carriage, which amazed the local &#x27;society&#x27; for whom he&#x27;d been known already as &quot;Provincial Sketches&quot;″ author. He settled in a small house, often visited people and received guests. Saltykov&#x27;s primary goal was to teach local minor officials elementary grammar and he spent many late evenings proof-reading and re-writing their incongruous reports. In 1862 Saltykov was transferred to Tver where he often performed governor&#x27;s functions. Here Saltykov proved to be a zealous promoter of the 1861 reforms. He personally sued several landowners accusing them of cruel treatment of peasants.

All the while his literary activities continued. In 1860-1862 he wrote and published (mostly, in &quot;Vremya&quot; magazine) numerous sketches and short stories, some later included into &quot;Innocent Stories&quot; (1857–1863) which demonstrated what Maxim Gorky later called a &quot;talent for talking politics through domesticities&quot; and &quot;Satires In Prose&quot; (1859–1862) where for the first time the author seemed to be quite vexed with the apathy of the oppressed. &quot;One is hardly to be expected to engage oneself in self-development when one&#x27;s only thought revolves around just one wish: not to die of hunger,&quot; he later explained. Many of Saltykov&#x27;s articles on agrarian reforms were also written in those three years, mostly in &quot;Moskovskye Vedomosty&quot;, where his major opponent was journalist Vladimir Rzhevsky.

====&quot;Sovremennik&quot;====
In 1862 Saltykov retired from the government service and came to Moscow with the view of founding his own magazine there. The Ministry of Education&#x27;s Special committee under the chairmanship of Prince D.A.Obolensky gave him no such permission. In the early 1863 Saltykov moved to Saint Petersburg to join Nekrasov&#x27;s &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, greatly undermined by the death of Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky&#x27;s arrest. In this magazine he published first sketches of the &quot;Pompadours&quot; cycle and got involved with &quot;Svistok&quot; (The Whistle), a satirical supplement, using pseudonyms N.Shchedrin, K.Turin and Mikhail Zmiev-Mladentsev.

The series of articles entitled &quot;Our Social Life&quot; (1863–1864), examining “new tendencies in Russian nihilism,” caused a raw with equally radical &quot;Russkoye Slovo&quot;. First Saltykov ridiculed Dmitry Pisarev&#x27;s unexpected call for Russian intelligentsia to pay more attention to natural sciences. Then in 1864 Pisarev responded by &quot;Flowers of Innocent Humor&quot; article published by &quot;Russkoye Slovo&quot; implying that Saltykov was cultivating &quot;laughter for good digestion&#x27;s sake&quot;. The latter&#x27;s reply contained accusations in isolationism and elitism. All this (along with heated discussion of Chernyshevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot;) was termed &quot;raskol in Russian nihilism&quot; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

On the other front, Saltykov waged a war against the Dostoyevsky brothers’ &quot;Grazhdanin&quot; magazine. When Fyodor Dostoyevsky came out with the suggestion that with Dobrolyubov&#x27;s death and Chernyshevsky&#x27;s imprisonment the radical movement in Russia became lifeless and dogmatic, Saltykov labeled him and his fellow pochvenniks &#x27;reactionaries&#x27;. Finally, the rift between him and Maxim Antonovich (supported by Grigory Eliseev) made Saltykov-Schedrin quit the journal. Only a small part of stories and sketches that Saltykov wrote at the time has made its way into his later books (&quot;Innocent Stories&quot;, &quot;Sign of the Time&quot;, &quot;Pompadours&quot;).

Being dependent on his &quot;Sovremennik&quot;″s meagre salaries, Saltykov was looking for work on the side and quarreled with Nekrasov a lot, promising to quit literature. According to Avdotya Panayeva&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;those were the times when his moods darkened, and I noticed a new habit of his developing - this jerky movement of neck, as if he was trying to free himself from some unseen tie, the habit which stayed with him for the rest of his life.&quot; Finally, pecuniary difficulties compelled Saltykov to re-enter the governmental service and in November 1864 he was appointed the head of the treasury department in Penza. Two years later he moved to take the same post in Tula, then Ryazan. Supported by his lyceum friend Mikhail Reitern, now the Minister of Finance, Saltykov adopted rather aggressive finance revision policies, making many enemies in the administrative circles of Tula, Ryazan and Penza. According to Alexander Skabichevsky (who had conversations with provincial officials working under Saltykov&#x27;s supervision) &quot;he was a rare kind of boss. Even though his frightful barking was making people wince, nobody feared him and everybody loved him - mostly for his caring for his subordinates&#x27; needs and also the tendency to overlook people&#x27;s minor weaknesses and faults when those were not interfering with work.&quot;

Finally the governor of Ryazan made an informal complaint which was accounted for by Count Shuvalov, the Chief of Staff of the Special Corps of Gendarmes, who issued a note stating that Saltykov, as a senior state official &quot;promoted ideas contradicting the needs of maintaining law and order&quot; and was &quot;always in conflict with people of local governments, criticizing and even sabotaging their orders.&quot; On July 14, 1868, Saltykov retired: thus the career of &quot;one of the strangest officials in Russian history&quot; ended. Years later, speaking to the historian M.Semevsky, Saltykov confessed he was trying to erase from memory years spent as a government official. But when his vis-a-vis argued that &quot;only his thorough knowledge of every possible stage of the Russian bureaucratic hierarchy made him what he was,&quot; the writer had to agree.

====&quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;====
On July 1, 1866, &quot;Sovremennik&quot; was closed. In the autumn Nekrasov approached the publisher Andrey Krayevsky and &#x27;rented&#x27; &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. In September 1868 Saltykov joined the re-vamped team of the magazine as a head of the journalistic department. As in December 1874 Saltykov&#x27;s health problems (triggered by severe cold he&#x27;s caught at his mother&#x27;s funeral) made him travel abroad for treatment, Nekrasov confessed in his April 1875 letter to Pavel Annenkov: &quot;This journalism thing has always been tough for us and now it lies in tatters. Saltykov carried it all manly and bravely and we all tried our best to follow suit.&quot; &quot;This was the only magazine that had its own face… Most talented people were coming to &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; as if it were their home. They trusted my taste and my common sense never to begrudge my editorial cuts. In &quot;OZ&quot; there were published weak things, but stupid things - never,&quot; he wrote in a letter to Pavel Annenkov on May 28, 1884. In 1869 Saltykov&#x27;s &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; and &quot;Letters About the Province&quot; came out, their general idea being that the reforms have failed and Russia remained the same country of absolute monarchy where peasant had no rights. &quot;The bars have fallen but Russia&#x27;s heart gave not a single twitch. Serfdom has been abolished, but landlords rejoiced,&quot; he wrote.

In 1870 &quot;The History of a Town&quot; (История одного города) came out, a grotesque, politically risky novel relating the tragicomic history of the fictitious Foolsville, a vague caricature upon the Russian Empire, with its sequence of monstrous rulers, tormenting their hapless vassals. The book was a satire on the whole institution of Russian statehood and the way of life itself, plagued by routine mismanagement, needless oppression, pointless tyranny and sufferers’ apathy. The novel ended with the deadly &quot;it&quot; sweeping the whole thing away, &quot;making the history stop&quot; which was construed by many as a call for radical political change. A series called &quot;Pompadours and Pompadouresses&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Pompadours&quot;, Помпадуры и помпадурши, 1863–1874) looked like a satellite to the &quot;History of a Town&quot;, a set of real life illustrations to the fantastic chronicles. &quot;The History of a Town&quot; caused much controversy. Alexey Suvorin accused the author of deliberately distorting Russian history and insulting the Russian people. &quot;By showing how people live under the yoke of madness I was hoping to invoke in a reader not mirth but most bitter feelings... It is not the history of the state as a whole that I make fun of, but a certain state of things,&quot; Saltykov explained.

In 1873 came out &quot;The Tashkenters Clique&quot; (Господа Ташкентцы ;&quot;Tashkent’ers&quot; was a generic term invented by Shchedrin for administrators sent to tame riots in the remote regions of the Russian Empire), a snipe at right-wingers who advocated cruel suppression of peasants&#x27; riots, and an experiment in the new form of social novel. 1877 saw the publication of &quot;In the Spheres of Temperance and Accuracy&quot;, a set of satirical sketches, featuring characters from the classical Russian literature (books by Fonvizin, Griboyedov, Gogol and others) in the contemporary political context.

===Later years===
&quot;The Well-Meant Speeches&quot; (Благонамеренные речи, 1876) featured characters belonging to new Russian bourgeoisie. On January 2, 1881, Saltykov wrote to the lawyer and author Yevgeny Utin: &quot;I took a look at the family, the state, the property and found out that none of such things exist. And that those very principles for the sake of which freedoms have been granted, were not respected as principles any more, even by those who seemed to hold them.&quot; &quot;The Well-Meant Speeches&quot; initially contained several stories about the Golovlyov family. In 1880 Saltykov-Shchedrin extracted all of them to begin a separate book which evolved into his most famous novel, showing the stagnation of the land-based dvoryanstvo. &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot; (Господа Головлёвы, 1880; also translated as &quot;A Family of Noblemen&quot;), a crushingly gloomy study of the institution of the family as cornerstone of society, traced the moral and physical decline of three generations of a Russian gentry family. Central to it was the figure of Porfiry &#x27;Little Judas&#x27; Golovlyov, a character whose nickname (Iudushka, in Russian transcription) became synonymous with mindless hypocrisy and self-destructive egotism, leading to moral degradation and disintegration of personality.

In the 1870s Saltykov sold his Moscow estate and bought the one near Oranienbaum, Saint Petersburg, which he came to refer to as &#x27;my Mon Repos&#x27;. He proved to be an unsuccessful landowner, though, and finally sold it, having lost a lot of money. Stories vaguely describing this experience later made it into the novel &quot;Mon Repos Haven&quot; (Убежище Монрепо, 1879) and the collection of sketches &quot;All the Year Round&quot; (Круглый год), both books attacking the very roots of Russian capitalism. &quot;Fatherland is a pie - that&#x27;s the idea those narrow, obnoxious minds follow,&quot; he wrote. The latter collection remained unfinished due to fierceness of censorship in the wake of the assassination of Alexander II.

In 1875-1885 Saltykov was often visiting Germany, Switzerland and France for medical treatment. The result of these recreational trips was the series of sketches called &quot;Abroad&quot; (За рубежом, 1880–1881), expressing skepticism about the Western veneer of respectability which hid underneath horrors similar to the ones that were open in Russia (the latter portrayed as The Boy Without Pants, as opposed to The Boy in Pants, symbolizing Europe). In 1882 &quot;Letters to Auntie&quot; (Письма к тётеньке), written in the atmosphere of tough censorship came out, a satire on the society in general and its cultural elite in particular (the &#x27;auntie&#x27; in question).

In 1883, now critically ill, Saltykov published &quot;Modern Idyll&quot; (Современная идиллия), the novel he started in 1877–1878, targeting those of intelligentsia who were eager to prove their loyalty to the authorities. &quot;The Poshekhonye Stories&quot; (Пошехонские рассказы, 1883), &quot;Motley Letters&quot; (Пёстрые письма, 1884) and &quot;Unfinished Talks&quot; (Недоконченные беседы, 1886) followed, but by this time &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; were under increasing pressure from the censors, Shchedrin&#x27;s prose being the latter&#x27;s main target. The May 1874 issue with &quot;The Well-Meant Speeches&quot; has been destroyed, several other releases postponed for Saltykov&#x27;s pieces to be excised. In 1874-1879 &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; suffered 18 censorial sanctions, all having to do with Shchedrin&#x27;s work, most of which (&quot;Well-Meant Speeches&quot;, &quot;Letters to Auntie&quot;, many fairytales) were banned. &quot;It is despicable times that we are living through... and it takes a lot of strength not to give up,&quot; Saltykov wrote.

The demise of &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; in 1884 dealt Saltykov a heavy blow. &quot;The possibility to talk with my readers has been taken away from me and this pain is stronger than any other,&quot; he complained. &quot;The whole of the Russian press suffered from the &quot;Otechestvenny Zapiski&quot;″s closure… Where there&#x27;s been a lively tissue now there is a chasm of emptiness. And Shchedrin&#x27;s life has been curtailed, probably, for many years, by this &#x27;excision&#x27;,&quot; wrote Korolenko in 1889. Saltykov-Shchedrin&#x27;s last works were published by &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot; and &quot;Russkye Vedomosti&quot;, among them a collection of satirical fables and tales &quot;Fairy Tales for Children of a Fair Age&quot; (Сказки для детей изрядного возраста, better known as &quot;Fables&quot;) and a cycle of sketches &quot;Small Things in Life&quot; (Мелочи жизни, 1881–1887), a set of realistic mini-dramas about common people destroyed by the terror of daily routine. Saltykov&#x27;s last publication was semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Old Years in Poshekhonye&quot; (Пошехонская старина), published in 1887–1889 in &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;. He planned another piece called &quot;Forgotten Words&quot; (writing to Nikolai Mikhailovsky not long before his death: &quot;There were, you know, words in Russian: honour, fatherland, humanity… They are worth of being reminded about&quot;) but never even started it.

Mikhail Evgraphovich Saltykov-Schedrin died of stroke in Saint Petersburg and was interred in the Volkovo Cemetery, next to Turgenev, according to his last wish.

== Legacy ==
Mikhail Bulgakov was among writers, influenced by Saltykov.

Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin is regarded to be the most prominent satirist in the history of the Russian literature. According to critic and biographer Maria Goryachkina, he managed to compile &quot;the satirical encyclopedia&quot; of contemporary Russian life, targeting first serfdom with its degrading effect upon the society, then, after its abolition, - corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, opportunistic tendencies in intelligentsia, greed and amorality of those at power, but also - apathy, meekness and social immobility of the common people of Russia. His satirical cycle &quot;Fables&quot; and the two major works, &quot;The History of a Town&quot; and &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot;, are widely regarded as his masterpieces. Maxim Gorky wrote in 1909: &quot;The importance of his satire is immense, first for… its almost clairvoyant vision of the path the Russian society had to travel - from 1860s to nowadays.&quot;

James Wood calls Shchedrin a precursor of Knut Hamsun and the modernists:
Saltykov-Shchedrin has been lavishly praised by Soviet critics as &quot;the true revolutionary&quot;, but his mindset (as far as they were concerned) was not without a &quot;fault&quot;, for he, according to Goryachkina, &quot;failed to recognize the historically progressive role of capitalism and never understood the importance of the emerging proletariat&quot;. Karl Marx (who knew Russian and held Shchedrin in high esteem) read &quot;Haven in Mon Repos&quot; (1878–1879) and was unimpressed. &quot;The last section, &#x27;Warnings&#x27;, is weak and the author in general seems to be not very strong on positivity,&quot; he wrote. Marx was also known reading other books by the author, namely &quot;The Gentlemen from Tashkent&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Provincial in St. Petersburg&quot;; among the Russian authors that Marx read, he particularly valued Pushkin, Gogol and Shchedrin.

Some contemporaries (Nikolai Pisarev, Alexei Suvorin) dismissed Saltykov-Shchedrin as the one taken to &#x27;laughing for laughter&#x27;s sake&#x27;. Vladimir Korolenko disagreed; he regarded Shchedrin&#x27;s laughter to be the essential part of Russian life. &quot;Shchedrin, he&#x27;s still laughing, people were saying, by way of reproach... Thankfully, yes, no matter how hard it was for him to do this, in the most morbid times of our recent history this laughter was heard… One had to have a great moral power to make others laugh, while suffering deeply (as he did) from all the grieves of those times,&quot; he argued.

According to D.S.Mirsky, the greater part of Saltykov&#x27;s work is a rather nondescript kind of satirical journalism, generally with little or no narrative structure, and intermediate in form between the classical &quot;character&quot; and the contemporary &quot;feuilleton&quot;. Greatly popular though it was in its own time, it has since lost much of its appeal simply because it satirizes social conditions that have long ceased to exist and much of it has become unintelligible without commentary. Mirsky saw &quot;The History of a Town&quot; (a sort of parody of Russian history, concentrated in the microcosm of a provincial town, whose successive governors are transparent caricatures of Russian sovereigns and ministers, and whose very name is representative of its qualities) as the work that summed up the achievement of Saltykov&#x27;s first period. He praised &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot;, calling it the gloomiest book in all Russian literature—&quot;all the more gloomy because the effect is attained by the simplest means without any theatrical, melodramatic, or atmospheric effects.&quot; &quot;The most remarkable character of this novel is Porfiry Golovlyov, nicknamed &#x27;Little Judas&#x27;, the empty and mechanical hypocrite who cannot stop talking unctuous and meaningless humbug, not for any inner need or outer profit, but because his tongue is in need of constant exercise,&quot; Mirsky wrote.
Most works of Saltykov&#x27;s later period were written in a language that the satirist himself called Aesopian. This way, though, the writer was able to fool censors in the times of political oppression and take most radical ideas to print, which was the matter of his pride. &quot;It is one continuous circumlocution because of censorship and requires a constant reading commentary,&quot; Mirsky argued. The use of Aesopic language was one reason why Saltykov-Shchedrin has never achieved as much acclaim in the West as had three of his great contemporaries, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, according to Sofia Kovalevskaya. &quot;It is unbelievable, how well we&#x27;ve learned to read between the lines in Russia,&quot; the great mathematician remarked in her essay written in 1889 in Swedish. Another reason had to do with peculiarities of Saltykov&#x27;s chosen genre: his credo &quot;has always been a satire, spiced with fantasy, not far removed from Rabelais, the kind of literature that&#x27;s tightly bound to its own national soil... Tears are the same wherever we go, but each nation laughs in its own way,&quot; Kovalevskaya argued.

Saltykov&#x27;s style of writing, according to D.S.Mirsky, was based on the bad journalistic style of the period, which originated largely with Osip Senkovsky, and which &quot;today invariably produces an impression of painfully elaborate vulgarity.&quot; Many other critics (Goryachkina among them) disagreed, praising the author&#x27;s lively, rich language and the way he mastered both stark realism (&quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot;, &quot;Old Times in Poshekhonye&quot;) and satirical grotesque merged with fantasy. Of the writer&#x27;s stylistic peculiarities biographer Sergey Krivenko (of the Narodnik movement, the one which Saltykov has always been in opposition to) wrote: &quot;It is difficult to assess his works using the established criteria. It&#x27;s a mix of a variety of genres: poetry and documentary report, epics and satire, tragedy and comedy. In the process of reading it is impossible to decide what exactly it is, but the general impression is invariably strong, as of something very lively and harmonic. Ignoring the established formats, Saltykov was driven by two things: current stream of new ideas and those lofty ideals he’s been aspiring to.&quot; Saltykov, according to Krivenko, occasionally repeated himself, but never denied this, explaining it by the need of always being engaged with &#x27;hot&#x27; issues – &quot;things which in the course of decades were in their own right repeating themselves with such damning monotony&quot;. &quot;There are not many writers in Rus whose very name would give that much to one&#x27;s mind and heart, and who&#x27;d leave such a vast literary heritage, rich and diverse both in essence and in form, written in a very special language which even in his lifetime became known as &#x27;saltykovian&#x27;,&quot; wrote Krivenko in 1895. &quot;Saltykov&#x27;s gift was no lesser than that of Gogol, neither in originality nor in itspower,&quot; the biographer reckoned.

Saltykov-Schedrin was a controversial figure and often found himself a target of sharp criticism, mainly for his alleged &#x27;lack of patriotism&#x27; and negativism. He&#x27;s never seen himself a promoter of the latter and often proclaimed his belief in the strength of a common man, seeing the latter as holder of principles of real democracy. In 1882, as he, feeling depressed by the critical response to his work, made rather a pessimistic assessment of his life in literature, Ivan Turgenev was quick to reassure him. &quot;The writer who is most hated, is most loved, too. You&#x27;d have known none of this, had you remained M.E.Saltykov, a mere hereditary Russian aristocrat. But you are Saltykov-Schedrin, a writer who happened to draw a distinctive line in our literature: that&#x27;s why you are either hated or loved, depending [on who reads you]. Such is the true &#x27;outcome&#x27; of your life in literature, and you must be pleased with it.&quot;

For all his insight and taste for detail, Saltykov was never keen on examining individual characters (even if he did create memorable ones). Admittedly, he was always more concerned with things general and typical, gauging social tendencies, collective urges and what he termed &#x27;herd instincts in a modern man&#x27;, often resorting to schemes and caricatures.

In his later years Saltykov-Schedrin found himself to be a strong influence upon the radical youth of the time. In 1885–1886, Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s brother Alexander and sister Anna were members of one of the numerous student&#x27;s delegations that came home to visit the ailing Schedrin, latter referring to him as &quot;the revolutionary youth&#x27;s favourite writer&quot;. Saltykov-Shedrin was a personal favourite of Lenin himself, who often namechecked the writer&#x27;s characters to prove his point – Iudushka, in particular, served well to label many of his adversaries: Russian old landlords and emerging capitalists, Tzarist government members and, notably, his own associate Trotzky.
