<text>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (; 19 October 1910 – 21 August 1995) was an Indian-American theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to the scientific knowledge about the structure of stars, stellar evolution and black holes. He was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in physics along with William A. Fowler for theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars. His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes. Many concepts, institutions and inventions, including the Chandrasekhar limit and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, are named after him.

Chandrasekhar worked on a wide variety of problems in physics during his lifetime, contributing to the contemporary understanding of stellar structure, white dwarfs, stellar dynamics, stochastic process, radiative transfer, the quantum theory of the hydrogen anion, hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability, turbulence, equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, general relativity, mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves. At the University of Cambridge, he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter. He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun – the Chandrasekhar limit. Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics first outlined by Jan Oort and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the Milky Way on stars rotating about the galactic centre. His solution to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations, describing a new quantity he termed &quot;dynamical friction&quot;, which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars. Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium, showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly.

Chandrasekhar studied at Presidency College, Madras (now Chennai) and the University of Cambridge. A long-time professor at the University of Chicago, he did some of his studies at the Yerkes Observatory, and served as editor of &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; from 1952 to 1971. He was on the faculty at Chicago from 1937 until his death in 1995 at the age of 84, and was the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics.

==Early life and education==
Subrahmanyan was born in Lahore on 19 October 1910 of the British Raj (present-day Pakistan) in a Tamil family, to Sita Balakrishnan (1891–1931) and Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar (1885–1960) who was stationed in Lahore as Deputy Auditor General of the Northwestern Railways at the time of Chandrasekhar&#x27;s birth. He had two elder sisters, Rajalakshmi and Balaparvathi, three younger brothers, Vishwanathan, Balakrishnan, and Ramanathan, and four younger sisters, Sarada, Vidya, Savitri, and Sundari. His paternal uncle was the Indian physicist and Nobel laureate Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman. His mother was devoted to intellectual pursuits, had translated Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; into Tamil and is credited with arousing Chandra&#x27;s intellectual curiosity at an early age. The family moved from Lahore to Allahabad in 1916, and finally settled in Madras in 1918.

Chandrasekhar was tutored at home until the age of 12. In middle school his father taught him mathematics and physics and his mother taught him Tamil. He later attended the Hindu High School, Triplicane, Madras during the years 1922–25. Subsequently, he studied at Presidency College, Madras (affiliated to the University of Madras) from 1925 to 1930, writing his first paper, &quot;The Compton Scattering and the New Statistics&quot;, in 1929 after being inspired by a lecture by Arnold Sommerfeld. He obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree, BSc (Hon.), in physics, in June 1930. In July 1930, Chandrasekhar was awarded a Government of India scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the University of Cambridge, where he was admitted to Trinity College, secured by R. H. Fowler with whom he communicated his first paper. During his travels to England, Chandrasekhar spent his time working out the statistical mechanics of the degenerate electron gas in white dwarf stars, providing relativistic corrections to Fowler&#x27;s previous work (see Legacy below).

==University of Cambridge==
In his first year at Cambridge, as a research student of Fowler, Chandrasekhar spent his time calculating mean opacities and applying his results to the construction of an improved model for the limiting mass of a degenerate star. At the meetings of the Royal Astronomical Society, he met E. A. Milne. At the invitation of Max Born he spent the summer of 1931, his second year of post-graduate studies, at Born&#x27;s institute at Göttingen, working on opacities, atomic absorption coefficients, and model stellar photospheres. On the advice of Paul Dirac, he spent his final year of graduate studies at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, where he met Niels Bohr.

After receiving a bronze medal for his work on degenerate stars, Chandrasekhar was awarded his PhD degree at Cambridge in the summer of 1933, with a thesis on rotating self-gravitating polytropes. On 9 October, he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College for the period 1933–1937, becoming only the second Indian to receive a Trinity Fellowship after Srinivasa Ramanujan 16 years earlier. He had been so certain of failing to obtain the fellowship that he had already made arrangements to study under Milne that autumn at Oxford, even going to the extent of renting a flat there.

During this time, Chandrasekhar became acquainted with British physicist Sir Arthur Eddington. Eddington took an interest in his work, but in January, 1935, gave a talk severely criticizing Chandrasekhar&#x27;s work (see #Dispute with Eddington and Chandrasekhar–Eddington dispute).

==Career and research==

===Early career===
In 1935, Chandrasekhar was invited by the director of the Harvard Observatory, Harlow Shapley, to be a visiting lecturer in theoretical astrophysics for a three-month period. He travelled to the United States in December. During his visit to Harvard, Chandrasekhar greatly impressed Shapley, but declined his offer of a Harvard research fellowship. At the same time, Chandrasekhar met Gerard Kuiper, a noted Dutch astrophysical observationalist who was then a leading authority on white dwarfs. Kuiper had recently been recruited by Otto Struve, the director of the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, which was run by the University of Chicago, and the university&#x27;s president, Robert Maynard Hutchins. Having known of Chandrasekhar, Struve was then considering him for one of three faculty posts in astrophysics, along with Kuiper; the other opening had been filled by Bengt Stromgren, a Danish theorist. Following a recommendation from Kuiper, Struve invited Chandrasekhar to Yerkes in March 1936 and offered him the job. Though Chandrasekhar was keenly interested, he initially declined the offer and left for England; after Hutchins sent a radiogram to Chandrasekhar during the voyage, he finally accepted, returning to Yerkes as an assistant professor of Theoretical Astrophysics in December 1936. Hutchins also intervened on an occasion where Chandra&#x27;s participation on teaching a course organised by Struve, was vetoed by the dean Henry Gale based on a racial prejudice; Hutchins said &quot;By all means have Mr. Chandrasekhar teach&quot;.

Chandrasekhar remained at the University of Chicago for his entire career. He was promoted to associate professor in 1941 and to full professor two years later at the age of 33. In 1946, when Princeton University offered Chandrasekhar a position vacated by Henry Norris Russell with a salary double that of Chicago&#x27;s, Hutchins incremented his salary matching with that of Princeton&#x27;s and persuaded Chandrasekhar to stay in Chicago. In 1952, he became the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics and Enrico Fermi Institute, upon Enrico Fermi&#x27;s invitation. In 1953, he and his wife, Lalitha Chandrasekhar, took American citizenship.

After the Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space Research (LASR) was built by NASA in 1966 at the university, Chandrasekhar occupied one of the four corner offices on the second floor. (The other corners housed John A. Simpson, Peter Meyer, and Eugene N. Parker.) Chandrasekhar lived at 4800 Lake Shore Drive after the high-rise apartment complex was built in the late 1960s, and later at 5550 Dorchester Building.

=== Dispute with Eddington ===

After graduating from Cambridge, Chandrasekhar, who was in close contact with Arthur Eddington, presented a full solution to his stellar equation at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting in 1935. Eddington booked a talk right after Chandrasekhar, where he openly criticized Chandrasekhar&#x27;s theory. This depressed Chandrasekhar and sparked a scientific dispute. Eddington refused to accept a limit for the mass of a star and proposed an alternative model. 

Chandrasekhar sought support from prominent physicists like Léon Rosenfeld, Niels Bohr and Christian Møller who found Eddington&#x27;s arguments lacking. The tension persisted through 1930s, as Eddington continued to openly criticize Chandrasekhar during meetings and the two compared each other&#x27;s theories in publications. Chandrasekhar ultimately completed his theory of white dwarfs in 1939, receiving praise from others in the field. Eddington died in 1944, and despite their disagreements, Chandrasekhar continued to state that he admired Eddington and considered him a friend.

===World War II===

During World War II, Chandrasekhar worked at the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. While there, he worked on problems of ballistics, resulting in reports such as 1943&#x27;s &quot;On the decay of plane shock waves&quot;, &quot;Optimum height for the bursting of a 105mm shell&quot;, &quot;On the Conditions for the Existence of Three Shock Waves&quot;, &quot;On the Determination of the Velocity of a Projectile from the Beat Waves Produced by Interference with the Waves of Modified Frequency Reflected from the Projectile&quot; and &quot;The normal reflection of a blast wave&quot;. Chandrasekhar&#x27;s expertise in hydrodynamics led Robert Oppenheimer to invite him to join the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, but delays in the processing of his security clearance prevented him from contributing to the project. It has been rumoured that he visited the Calutron project.

===Philosophy of systematization===

He wrote that his scientific research was motivated by his desire to participate in the progress of different subjects in science to the best of his ability, and that the prime motive underlying his work was &quot;systematization&quot;. &quot;What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain, a certain aspect, or a certain detail, and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme which has form and coherence; and, if not, to seek further information which would help him to do that&quot;.

Chandrasekhar developed a unique style of mastering several fields of physics and astrophysics; consequently, his working life can be divided into distinct periods. He would exhaustively study a specific area, publish several papers in it and then write a book summarizing the major concepts in the field. He would then move on to another field for the next decade and repeat the pattern. Thus he studied stellar structure, including the theory of white dwarfs, during the years 1929 to 1939, and subsequently focused on stellar dynamics, theory of Brownian motion from 1939 to 1943. Next, he concentrated on the theory of radiative transfer and the quantum theory of the negative ion of hydrogen from 1943 to 1950. This was followed by sustained work on turbulence and hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability from 1950 to 1961. In the 1960s, he studied both the equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, and general relativity. During the period, 1971 to 1983 he studied the mathematical theory of black holes, and, finally, during the late 80s, he worked on the theory of colliding gravitational waves.

===Work with students===

Chandra worked closely with his students and expressed pride in the fact that over a 50-year period (from roughly 1930 to 1980), the average age of his co-author collaborators had remained the same, at around 30. He insisted that students address him as &quot;Prof. Chandrasekhar&quot; until they received their PhD degree, after which time they (as other colleagues) were encouraged to address him as &quot;Chandra&quot;. When Chandrasekhar was working at the Yerkes Observatory in 1940s, he would drive to and from every weekend to teach a course at the University of Chicago. Two of the students who took the course, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, won the Nobel prize before he could get one for himself. Regarding classroom interactions during his lectures, noted astrophysicist Carl Sagan stated from firsthand experience that &quot;frivolous questions&quot; from unprepared students were &quot;dealt with in the manner of a summary execution&quot;, while questions of merit &quot;were given serious attention and response&quot;.

===Other activities===

From 1952 to 1971 Chandrasekhar was editor of &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot;. When Eugene Parker submitted a paper on his discovery of solar wind in 1957, two eminent reviewers rejected the paper. However, since Chandra as an editor could not find any mathematical flaws in Parker&#x27;s work, he went ahead and published the paper in 1958.

During the years 1990 to 1995, Chandrasekhar worked on a project devoted to explaining the detailed geometric arguments in Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; using the language and methods of ordinary calculus. The effort resulted in the book &quot;Newton&#x27;s Principia for the Common Reader&quot;, published in 1995.

Chandrasekhar also worked on collision of gravitational waves, and algebraically special perturbations.

==Personal life==
Chandrasekhar was the nephew of C. V. Raman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930.

Chandrasekhar married Lalitha Doraiswamy in September 1936. He met her as a fellow student at Presidency College. He became a naturalised citizen of the U.S. in 1953. Many considered him as warm, positive, generous, unassuming, meticulous, and open to debate, while some others as private, intimidating, impatient and stubborn regarding non-scientific matters, and unforgiving to those who ridiculed his work. Chandrasekhar was a vegetarian.

Chandrasekhar died of a heart attack at the University of Chicago Hospital in 1995, having survived a prior heart attack in 1975. He was survived by his wife, who died on 2 September 2013 at the age of 102. She was a serious student of literature and western classical music.

Once when involved in a discussion about the Bhagavad Gita, Chandrasekhar said: &quot;I should like to preface my remarks with a personal statement in order that my later remarks will not be misunderstood. I consider myself an atheist&quot;. This was also confirmed many times in his other talks. Kameshwar C. Wali quoted him saying: &quot;I am not religious in any sense; in fact, I consider myself an atheist.&quot; In an interview with Kevin Krisciunas at the University of Chicago, on 6 October 1987, Chandrasekhar commented: &quot;Of course, he (Otto Struve) knew I was an atheist, and he never brought up the subject with me&quot;.

==Awards, honours and legacy==

===Nobel prize===

Chandrasekhar was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for his studies on the physical processes important to the structure and evolution of stars. Chandrasekhar accepted this honour, but was upset the citation mentioned only his earliest work, seeing it as a denigration of a lifetime&#x27;s achievement. He shared it with William A. Fowler.

===Legacy===

Chandrasekhar&#x27;s most notable work is on the astrophysical Chandrasekhar limit. The limit gives the maximum mass of a white dwarf star, ~1.44 solar masses, or equivalently, the minimum mass that must be exceeded for a star to collapse into a neutron star or black hole (following a supernova). The limit was first calculated by Chandrasekhar in 1930 during his maiden voyage from India to Cambridge, England for his graduate studies. In 1979, NASA named the third of its four &quot;Great Observatories&quot; after Chandrasekhar. This followed a naming contest which attracted 6,000 entries from fifty states and sixty-one countries. The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched and deployed by Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; on 23 July 1999. The Chandrasekhar number, an important dimensionless number of magnetohydrodynamics, is named after him. The asteroid 1958 Chandra is also named after Chandrasekhar. The Himalayan Chandra Telescope is named after him. In the &quot;Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society of London&quot;, R. J. Tayler wrote: &quot;Chandrasekhar was a classical applied mathematician whose research was primarily applied in astronomy and whose like will probably never be seen again.&quot;

Chandrasekhar supervised 45 PhD students. After his death, his wife Lalitha Chandrasekhar made a gift of his Nobel Prize money to the University of Chicago towards the establishment of the Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Memorial Fellowship. First awarded in the year 2000, this fellowship is given annually to an outstanding applicant to graduate school in the PhD programs of the department of physics or the department of astronomy and astrophysics. S. Chandrasekhar Prize of Plasma Physics is an award given by Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPS) to outstanding plasma physicists, started in the year 2014.

The Chandra Astrophysics Institute (CAI) is a program offered for high school students who are interested in astrophysics mentored by MIT scientists and sponsored by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Carl Sagan praised him in the book &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot;: &quot;I discovered what true mathematical elegance is from Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.&quot; On 19 October 2017, Google showed a Google Doodle in 28 countries honouring Chandrasekhar&#x27;s 107th birthday and the Chandrasekhar limit.

In 2010, on account of Chandra&#x27;s 100th birthday, University of Chicago conducted a symposium titled &quot;Chandrasekhar Centennial Symposium 2010&quot; which was attended by leading astrophysicists such as Roger Penrose, Kip Thorne, Freeman Dyson, Jayant V. Narlikar, Rashid Sunyaev, G. Srinivasan, and Clifford Will. Its research talks were published in 2011 as a book titled &quot;Fluid flows to Black Holes: A tribute to S Chandrasekhar on his birth centenary&quot;.

<text>Isabelle Anne Madeleine Huppert (; born 16 March 1953) is a French actress. Known for her portrayals of cold, austere women devoid of morality, she is considered one of the greatest actresses of her generation. With 16 nominations and two wins, Huppert is the most nominated actress at the César Awards. She is also the recipient of several accolades, such as 5 Lumière Awards, a BAFTA Award, 3 European Film Awards, 2 Berlin International Film Festival, 3 Cannes Film Festival and Venice Film Festival honors, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award nomination. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her second on its list of the greatest actors of the 21st century.

Huppert&#x27;s first César Award nomination was for Best Supporting Actress in &quot;Aloïse&quot; (1975) and she won Best Actress for &quot;La Cérémonie&quot; (1995) and &quot;Elle&quot; (2016). For &quot;The Lacemaker&quot; (1977) she won the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer. She went on to win two Cannes Film Festival Awards for Best Actress for &quot;Violette Nozière&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; (2001) as well as the Volpi Cup for Best Actress twice for &quot;Story of Women&quot; (1988) and &quot;La Cérémonie&quot;.

For her performance in &quot;Elle&quot;, Huppert was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress; she also won several critics awards as well as a Golden Globe and Independent Spirit Award. Huppert is among international cinema&#x27;s most prolific actresses with her best known English-language films including &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; (1987), &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), &quot;The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby&quot; (2013), &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; (2015), &quot;Greta&quot; (2018), &quot;Frankie&quot; (2019), and &quot;Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris&quot; (2022).

Also a prolific stage actress, Huppert is the most nominated actress for the Molière Award, with nine nominations; she received an honorary award in 2017. In the same year she was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize. She made her London stage debut in the title role of the play &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; in 1996, and her New York stage debut in a 2005 production of &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot;. Huppert&#x27;s recent credits include in Heiner Müller&#x27;s &quot;Quartett&quot; (2009) in New York, Sydney Theater Company&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot; (2014) and in Florian Zeller&#x27;s &quot;The Mother&quot; (2019) in New York.

== Early life and education ==
Huppert was born on 16 March 1953, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, the daughter of Annick (&quot;née&quot; Beau; 1914–1990), an English language teacher, and Raymond Huppert (1914–2003), a safe manufacturer. The youngest child, she has a brother and three sisters, including filmmaker Caroline Huppert. She was raised in Ville-d&#x27;Avray. Her father was Jewish; his family was from Eperjes, Kingdom of Hungary, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Prešov, Slovakia) and Alsace-Lorraine. Huppert was raised in her mother&#x27;s Catholic faith. On her mother&#x27;s side, she is a great-granddaughter of one of the Callot Soeurs.

In 1968, aged 15, Huppert enrolled at the , where she won a prize for her acting. She also attended the Conservatoire national supérieur d&#x27;art dramatique (CNSAD).

==Career==

===1970s===
Huppert made her television debut in 1971 with &quot;Le Prussien&quot;, and her feature film debut in Nina Companeez&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Faustine et le Bel Été&quot; (1972). The film was shown Out of Competition at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. Also that year she played Annie Smith in Alain Levent&#x27;s adventure film &quot;The Bar at the Crossing&quot; and Marite in Claude Sautet&#x27;s romance drama &quot;César and Rosalie&quot; with the former premiering at the Berlin International Film Festival. She made her theatre debut playing Lucile in &quot;Les Précieuses ridicules&quot; at the Comédie-Française in Paris from 1971 to 1972. Later that year she acted in &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; at National Theatre Daniel Sorano in Paris followed by a run at the Shiraz Arts Festival.

In 1974 she acted in Alain Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s art film &quot;Successive Slidings of Pleasure&quot; and Rachel Weinberg&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;L&#x27;Ampélopède&quot;. She also gained notoriety for her later appearance as Suzanne in Bertrand Blier&#x27;s controversial sex comedy &quot;Les Valseuses&quot; (1974). Huppert acted alongside Gérard Depardieu and Jeanne Moreau. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the film writing, &quot;It&#x27;s not very invigorating to see so much talent squandered on such foolish mixed-up romanticism.&quot; The role made her increasingly recognized by the public.

The following year she acted in Yves Boisset&#x27;s drama &quot;The Common Man&quot; (1975) which won the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival. That same year starred in the American action thriller &quot;Rosebud&quot; (1975) directed by Otto Preminger. She acted opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole and Richard Attenborough. She also starred in the title role in the drama film &quot;Aloïse&quot; which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1976 she acted in Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;The Judge and the Assassin&quot; and Christine Lipinska&#x27;s &quot;I Am Pierre Riviere&quot;.

Her international breakthrough came with her performance in Claude Goretta&#x27;s &quot;La Dentelliere&quot; (1977), for which she won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles. Critic Roger Ebert praised her performance writing, &quot;The movie’s performances are wonderfully subtle. Huppert, as Pomme, is good at the very difficult task of projecting the inner feelings of a character whose whole personality is based on the concealment of feeling&quot;. The following year she won acclaim playing the title role Claude Chabrol&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Violette Nozière&quot; (1978) winning the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. It was the first of seven collaborations she would have with director Chabrol. Ebert wrote, &quot;Huppert&#x27;s performance, which is so assured, so complex it&#x27;s hard to believe she worked this transformation in character after &quot;The Lacemaker&quot;.

===1980s===
After a five-year absence from American films, Huppert starred in Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), which opened to poor reviews and was a box office failure; decades later, the film has been reassessed, with some critics considering it an overlooked masterpiece. Also that year she starred in Maurice Pialat&#x27;s &quot;Loulou&quot; (1980) where she reunited with Gérard Depardieu. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her performance writing, &quot;Miss Huppert does a fine job of seeming exotic, vague, dazzling and also, somehow, unremarkable - all of this at the same time. The performances are much sharper than the film is as a whole.&quot; Also in 1980 she acted in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Sauve qui peut (la vie)&quot; (1980).

Throughout the 1980s, Huppert continued to explore enigmatic and emotionally distant characters, most notably in &quot;Coup de Torchon&quot; (1983) directed by Bertrand Tavernier, adapted from Jim Thompson&#x27;s pulp novel &quot;Pop. 1280&quot;. Huppert earned a César Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance. She acted in Curtis Hanson&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; (1987) acting opposite Steve Guttenberg and Elizabeth McGovern. She won acclaim for her role in Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Une Affaire de Femmes&quot; (1988).

===1990s===

In 1994, Huppert collaborated with American director Hal Hartley on &quot;Amateur&quot;, one of her few English-language performances since &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. She won acclaim for her role in &quot;La Séparation&quot; (1994) with David Parkinson of &quot;British Film Institute&quot; writing, &quot;Her distinctive talent for suppressing suffering is readily evident in Christian Vincent’s excruciating study of her slowly disintegrating relationship with Daniel Auteuil, as Huppert imparts chilling intimacy to a withdrawn hand, an unanswering gaze, a treacherous silence and a careless word in conveying the pain of falling out of love.&quot; She portrayed a manic and homicidal post-office worker in Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;La Cérémonie&quot; (1995) for which she won the César Award for Best Actress and the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. Huppert continued her cinematic relationship with Chabrol in &quot;Rien ne va plus&quot; (1997) and &quot;Merci pour le Chocolat&quot; (2000).

===2000s===

Huppert&#x27;s first collaboration with Austrian director Michael Haneke was in &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; (2001), based on the titular novel (&quot;Die Klavierspielerin&quot;) by Elfriede Jelinek, who was named a Nobel Laureate in Literature in 2004. In the film, she played a piano teacher who becomes involved with a young and charming pianist. Regarded as one of her most impressive turns, the performance won her the 2001 Best Actress Award at Cannes. David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised her work in the film, writing: &quot;Much of her best acting is no more than a flicker of consciousness, barely visible around the edges of the mask. Yet she gives a classic account of repression and sexual hypocrisy, unleashing the kind of rage that the great Bette Davis might have expressed&quot;.

In 2002 she acted in the dark comedy musical film &quot;8 Women&quot;, directed by François Ozon. Jonathan Cruiel of &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote of her: &quot;Huppert has a reputation for her intense portrayals, and in &quot;8 Women&quot;, she steals every scene she&#x27;s in as the uptight, melodramatic, bespectacled aunt.&quot; In 2004, she starred in Christophe Honoré&#x27;s &quot;Ma Mère&quot;, based on a novel by Georges Bataille. She portrayed Hélène, a middle-aged mother in an incestuous relationship with her teenage son, played by Louis Garrel. She also starred opposite Dustin Hoffman and Jason Schwartzman in David O. Russell&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;. 

Huppert also worked in Italy (with directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Mauro Bolognini, Marco Ferreri and Marco Bellocchio), in Russia (with Igor Minaiev), in Central Europe (with Werner Schroeter, Andrzej Wajda, Ursula Meier, Michael Haneke, Márta Mészáros and Aleksandar Petrović) and in Asia (with Hong Sang-soo, Brillante Mendoza and Rithy Panh).

Huppert is also an acclaimed stage actress, receiving seven Molière Award nominations, including for the lead in a 2001 Paris production of &quot;Medea&quot; directed by Jacques Lassalle; and in 2005 in the title role of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe in Paris. Later that year, she toured the United States in a Royal Court Theatre production of Sarah Kane&#x27;s theatrical piece &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot;. This production was directed by and performed in French. Huppert returned to the New York stage in 2009 to perform in Heiner Müller&#x27;s &quot;Quartett&quot;. In 2009 she also starred in the film &quot;White Material&quot;; Sura Wood of The Associated Press declared that its director, Claire Denis, was &quot;helped immeasurably by an astringent, fully committed performance from her leading lady, a gaunt, impossibly resolute Isabelle Huppert&quot;.
Huppert served as president of the jury at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. She had been a Member of the Jury and Master of Ceremony in previous years, as well as winning the Best Actress Award twice. As president in 2009, she and her jury awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or to &quot;The White Ribbon&quot; by Michael Haneke, her director on &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; and &quot;Time of the Wolf&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2010, Huppert starred in the 11th-season finale of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and was cast in the film &quot;Captive&quot; by Filipino director Brillante Mendoza. Huppert played one of the hostages of the Dos Palmas kidnappings.

In 2012, she starred in two films that competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival: Michael Haneke&#x27;s &quot;Amour&quot; and Hong Sang-soo&#x27;s &quot;In Another Country&quot;, with the former winning the top prize. In 2013, she co-starred in Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot; by Jean Genet, with Cate Blanchett and Elizabeth Debicki and directed by Benedict Andrews in a new English translation by Andrews and Andrew Upton. In 2014, the production toured in New York as a part of the Lincoln Center Festival. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of Blanchett and Huppert&#x27;s performances, &quot;Blanchett gives a dynamic performance as Claire, the melodramatic sister, who flies into a fit at the least provocation. Huppert plays Solange as the smarter, more subtle, more bitterly ironic observer.&quot; She continued acting in films such as &quot;The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby&quot; (2013), &quot;Macadam Stories&quot; (2015), and &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; (2015).

In 2016, she starred in two films that received widespread critical acclaim: Mia Hansen-Løve&#x27;s &quot;Things to Come&quot;, which premiered at the Berlinale, and Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Elle&quot;, which premiered at Cannes. In &quot;Elle&quot; she played a woman who was raped by an intruder. Nick James of &quot;The British Film Institute&quot; wrote, &quot;Isabelle Huppert gives one of the most riveting performances of her career...refusing to play the victim in a challenging, twisty thriller that seeks to subvert the expectations of the traditional revenge drama&quot;. Among other awards and nominations, she won the National Society of Film Critics Award, New York Film Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress for both films. For her performance in &quot;Elle&quot;, Huppert won several awards, including the Golden Globe Award, César Award for Best Actress, Gotham Independent Film Award, and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress. In addition, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress.

In 2016, Huppert starred in Krzysztof Warlikowski&#x27;s stage production of &quot;Phèdre(s)&quot;, which toured Europe as well as BAM in New York. Katie Baker of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote, &quot;Huppert inhabits Phaedra—or Phèdre, for the play is in French with subtitles—for the full 3½ hours with such magnetic force that whatever faults the show has pale next to her raw vitality.&quot; In 2017, she was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize. On that occasion she performed with Jeremy Irons &quot;Correspondence 1944–1959 Readings from the epistles between Albert Camus and Maria Casares,&quot; and a special creation of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Ashes to Ashes,&quot; at the Teatro Argentina in Rome. In 2019 she played the title role in Florian Zeller&#x27;s play &quot;The Mother&quot; acting opposite Chris Noth at the Atlantic Theatre Company in New York. &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Huppert&#x27;s performance but criticized the production. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;In the end, this turns out to be an upsetting play rather than an engaging one, and if it weren’t for Huppert’s mesmerizing performance, it might send you out of the theater and screaming into the night.&quot; In 2018 she acted as herself in the French comedy series &quot;Call My Agent!&quot; and as Jacqueline in Matthew Weiner&#x27;s Amazon Prime series &quot;The Romanoffs&quot;. During this time she acted in Michael Haneke&#x27;s &quot;Happy End&quot; (2017), Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Greta&quot; (2018) and Ira Sachs&#x27; &quot;Frankie&quot; (2019).

===2020s===
Huppert&#x27;s recent credits include Jerzy Skolimowski&#x27;s &quot;EO&quot; and Anthony Fabian&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris&quot; (both released in 2022), as well as &quot;The Sitting Duck&quot; which was theatrically released in 2023 after having premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in 2022. In 2024, she starred in her third collaboration with Hong Sang-soo in &quot;A Traveler&#x27;s Needs&quot; that competed at the 2024 Berlin Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize.

On stage, Huppert has starred in the following plays &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; as Amanda Wingfield, directed by Ivo van Hove (2022), &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; as Lyubov, directed by Tiago Rodrigues (2023). Both productions have garnered Huppert nominations for Best Actress in a Play at the Molière Awards. Her other stage credits include a reinterpretation of Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Bérénice&quot; (2024), directed by Romeo Castelluci at the Théâtre de la Ville in Paris; and as Mary, Queen of Scots in the experimental play &quot;Mary Said What She Said&quot; (2019-) directed by Robert Wilson which have toured in many select European cities.

Huppert is also a global ambassador of luxury fashion line Balenciaga.

In 2024, Huppert presided as the Jury President for the main competition of the 81st edition of Venice Film Festival.

She is one of only four women who have twice won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival: in 1978 for her role in &quot;Violette Nozière&quot; by Claude Chabrol (tied with Jill Clayburgh) and in 2001 for &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; by Michael Haneke.

She is also one of only four women who have twice received the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival: in 1988 for her part in &quot;Une affaire de femmes&quot; (tied with Shirley MacLaine), and in 1995 for &quot;La Cérémonie&quot; (tied with her partner in the movie, Sandrine Bonnaire). Both films were directed by Claude Chabrol. Additionally, she received a Special Lion in 2005 for her role in &quot;Gabrielle&quot;. Huppert was twice voted Best Actress at the European Film Awards: in 2001 for playing Erika Kohut in &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot;, and in 2002 with the entire cast of &quot;8 Women&quot; (directed by François Ozon). The latter cast also won a Silver Bear for &quot;Outstanding Artistic Contribution&quot;, at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival. Huppert won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and received her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work in &quot;Elle&quot;.

She was selected for Honorary Golden Bear Lifetime Achievement Award at 72nd Berlin International Film Festival awarded on 15 February 2022 in festival award ceremony at Berlinale Palást.

 Europe Theatre Prize 

On 17 December 2017 she was awarded the XVI Europe Theatre Prize, in Rome. The Prize organization stated:From her beginnings as a stage actress, Isabelle Huppert has moved between cinema and theatre with an extraordinary productivity, and with results which have made her perhaps the most garlanded performer in the two spheres. Her name, directly linked with French and European auteur cinema, is a guarantee of quality for the productions in which she takes part: she is an artist who chooses her scripts, her roles and the directors with whom she works with the greatest care, always able to make her mark on the films in which she appears. Isabelle Huppert, a world icon in contemporary cinema, has never abandoned the theatre, an art which she continues to practise with passion, deep interest and admirable playing skills. The reasons for her passionate love of theatre, which she herself gave in her message for this year&#x27;s World Theatre Day, are completely in accord with the motivation for the 16th Europe Theatre Prize, which we award to her this year with real pleasure: «Theatre for me represents the other; it is dialogue, and it is the absence of hatred. &quot;Friendship between peoples&quot; – now, I do not know too much about what this means, but I believe in community, in friendship between spectators and actors, in the lasting union between all the people theatre brings together – translators, educators, costume designers, stage artists, academics, practitioners and audiences. Theatre protects us; it shelters us…I believe that theatre loves us…as much as we love it… I remember an old-fashioned stage director I worked for, who, before the nightly raising of the curtain would yell, with full-throated firmness &quot;Make way for theatre!&quot;»

== Legacy and reception ==

Huppert holds the record for being the actress with the most films entered in the official competition of the Cannes Film Festival. As of 2022, she has had 22 films in the main competition and a total of 29 films screened at the festival. Huppert&#x27;s frequent Cannes&#x27; appearances have led her to be dubbed &quot;the queen of Cannes&quot; by journalists.

David Thomson on Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;: &quot;[Huppert] has to rate as one of the most accomplished actresses in the world today, even if she seems short of the passion or agony of her contemporary, Isabelle Adjani.&quot; Stuart Jeffries of &quot;The Observer&quot; on &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot;: &quot;This is surely one of the greatest performances of Huppert&#x27;s already illustrious acting career, though it is one that is very hard to watch.&quot; Director, Michael Haneke: &quot;[Huppert] has such professionalism, the way she is able to represent suffering. At one end you have the extreme of her suffering and then you have her icy intellectualism. No other actor can combine the two.&quot; Of her performance in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Love&quot;, Roger Ebert said &quot;Isabelle Huppert makes one good film after another... she is fearless. Directors often depend on her gift for conveying depression, compulsion, egotism and despair. She can be funny and charming, but then so can a lot of actors. She is in complete command of a face that regards the void with blankness.&quot; In 2010, S.T. VanAirsdale described her as &quot;arguably the world&#x27;s greatest screen actress.&quot;

Huppert&#x27;s work in &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Things to Come&quot; topped &quot;The Playlist&quot;&#x27;s ranking of &quot;The 25 Best Performances Of 2016&quot;, stating: &quot;She runs the emotional gamut from one film to the next, carnal, savage, shattered, listless, invulnerable but exposed, a woman on the verge of collapse who refuses to succumb to her instabilities. Huppert&#x27;s career spans four decades and change, plus a heap of awards and accolades, but with &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Things To Come&quot;, she could well be having her best year yet.&quot;

<doc id="145321" wikidata="Q164499" url="?curid=145321" title="Wulfhere of Mercia">
<text>Wulfhere or Wulfar (died 675) was King of Mercia from 658 until 675 AD. He was the first Christian king of all of Mercia, though it is not known when or how he converted from Anglo-Saxon paganism. His accession marked the end of Oswiu of Northumbria&#x27;s overlordship of southern England, and Wulfhere extended his influence over much of that region. His campaigns against the West Saxons led to Mercian control of much of the Thames valley. He conquered the Isle of Wight and the Meon valley and gave them to King Æthelwealh of the South Saxons. He also had influence in Surrey, Essex, and Kent. He married Eormenhild, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent.

Wulfhere&#x27;s father, Penda, was killed in 655 at the Battle of Winwaed, fighting against Oswiu of Northumbria. Penda&#x27;s son Peada became king under Oswiu&#x27;s overlordship but was murdered six months later. Wulfhere came to the throne when Mercian nobles organized a revolt against Northumbrian rule in 658 and drove out Oswiu&#x27;s governors.

By 670, when Oswiu died, Wulfhere was the most powerful king in southern England. He was effectively the overlord of England south of the Humber from the early 660s, although not overlord of Northumbria as his father had been. In 674, he challenged Oswiu&#x27;s son Ecgfrith of Northumbria, but was defeated. He died, probably of disease, in 675. Wulfhere was succeeded as King of Mercia by his brother, Æthelred. Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; describes Wulfhere as &quot;a man of proud mind, and insatiable will&quot;.

==Mercia in the 7th century==

England in AD 600 was ruled almost entirely by the Anglo-Saxon peoples who had come to Britain from northwestern Europe over the previous 200 years. The monk Bede, writing in about AD 731, considered the Mercians to be descended from the Angles, one of the invading groups; the Saxons and Jutes settled in the south of Britain, while the Angles settled in the north. Little is known about the origins of the kingdom of Mercia, in what is now the English Midlands, but according to genealogies preserved in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the Anglian collection the early kings were descended from Icel; the dynasty is therefore known as the Iclingas. The earliest Mercian king about whom definite historical information has survived is Penda of Mercia, Wulfhere&#x27;s father.

According to Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;, a history of the English church, there were seven early Anglo-Saxon rulers who held &quot;imperium&quot;, or overlordship, over the other kingdoms. The fifth of these was Edwin of Northumbria, who was killed at the Battle of Hatfield Chase by a combined force including Cadwallon, a British king of Gwynedd and Penda. At the time of this victory, Penda was probably not yet king of Mercia. His children included two future kings of Mercia: Wulfhere and Æthelred.

After Edwin&#x27;s death, Northumbria briefly fell apart into its two constituent kingdoms - Bernicia and Deira. Within a year Oswald killed Cadwallon and reunited the kingdoms, and subsequently re-established Northumbrian hegemony over the south of England. However, on 5 August 642, Penda killed Oswald at the Battle of Maserfield, probably at Oswestry in the northwest midlands. Penda is not recorded as overlord of the other southern Anglo-Saxon kings, but he became the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings after he defeated Oswald. On Oswald&#x27;s death, Northumbria was divided again: Oswald&#x27;s son Oswiu succeeded to the throne of Bernicia, and Osric&#x27;s son Oswine to Deira, the southern of the two kingdoms.

The main source for this period is Bede&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work also provides valuable information about the early pagan kingdoms. For other kingdoms than his native Northumbria, such as Wessex and Kent, Bede had an informant within the ecclesiastical establishment who supplied him with additional information. This does not seem to have been the case with Mercia, about which Bede is less informative than about other kingdoms. Further sources for this period include the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, compiled at the end of the 9th century in Wessex. The &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods.

==Ancestry==
Wulfhere was the son of Penda of Mercia. Penda&#x27;s queen, Cynewise, is named by Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and so it is likely but not certain that she was Wulfhere&#x27;s mother. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; gives Penda&#x27;s age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty years old at the time of his death, which is generally thought unlikely as two of his sons (Wulfhere and Æthelred) are recorded as being young when he was killed. It is thought at least as likely that Penda was 50 years old at his death, rather than at his accession. Wulfhere&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes him as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he was in his middle teens at that time; Penda would then have been in his thirties at the time Wulfhere was born.

Nothing is known of Wulfhere&#x27;s childhood. He had two brothers, Peada and Æthelred, and two sisters, Cyneburh and Cyneswith; it is also possible that Merewalh, king of the Magonsæte, was Wulfhere&#x27;s brother. He married Eormenhild of Kent; no date is recorded for the marriage and there is no record of any children in the earliest sources, though Coenred, who was king of Mercia from 704 to 709, is recorded in John of Worcester&#x27;s 12th-century chronicle as Wulfhere&#x27;s son. Another possible child is Berhtwald, a subking who is recorded as a nephew of Æthelred, and a third child, Werburh, is recorded in an 11th-century manuscript as a daughter of Wulfhere. An 11th-century history of St. Peter&#x27;s Monastery in Gloucester names two other women, Eadburh and Eafe, as queens of Wulfhere, but neither claim is plausible.

==Accession and overlordship==
In 655 Penda besieged Oswiu of Northumbria at Iudeu, the location of which is unknown but which may have been Stirling, in Scotland. Penda took Oswiu&#x27;s son, Ecgfrith, as hostage, and Oswiu paid tribute, in the form of treasure, to secure Penda&#x27;s departure. On the way back to Mercia, Oswiu overtook Penda and on 15 November 655 Oswiu and Penda fought on the banks of the (unidentified) River Winwaed. Penda was killed and beheaded by Oswiu, who divided Mercia into northern and southern halves. The northern portion was kept under direct Northumbrian control; the southern kingdom was given to Penda&#x27;s son Peada, who had married Oswiu&#x27;s daughter Ealhflæd &quot;ca&quot; 653.

Peada did not remain king long. He was murdered at Easter in 656, perhaps with the connivance of his wife, Oswiu&#x27;s daughter. Oswiu then ruled all Mercia himself. Bede lists Oswiu as the seventh and last king to hold &quot;imperium&quot; (or bretwalda in the language of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;) over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Overlordship was a common relationship between kingdoms at this time, often taking the form of a lesser king under the domination of a stronger one. Oswiu went further than this, however, and installed his own governors in Mercia after the deaths of Penda and Peada. This attempt to establish close control of Mercia failed in 658 when three Mercian leaders, Immin, Eafa and Eadbert, rebelled against the Northumbrians. Bede reports that they had kept Wulfhere in hiding, and when the revolt succeeded Wulfhere became king. It has been suggested that the Mercian revolt succeeded because Oswiu may have been occupied with fighting in Pictland, in northern Britain. His nephew the Pictish king Talorgan, son of Eanfrith, had died in 657.

How much direct control Oswiu exerted over the southern kingdoms during his imperium is unclear. Bede describes Oswiu&#x27;s friendship and influence over Sigeberht of the East Saxons, but generally the pattern in the southeast is of more local domination, with Oswiu&#x27;s influence unlikely to have been particularly strong. Wulfhere appears to have taken over Oswiu&#x27;s position in many instances. Bede does not list him as one of the rulers who exercised &quot;imperium&quot;, but modern historians consider that the rise to primacy of the kingdom of Mercia began in his reign. He seems to have been the effective overlord of Britain south of the Humber from the early 660s, though not overlord of Northumbria as his father had been.

A document called the Tribal Hidage may date from Wulfhere&#x27;s reign. Drawn up before many smaller groups of peoples were absorbed into the larger kingdoms, such as Mercia, it records the peoples of Anglo-Saxon England, along with an assessment in hides, a unit of land. The Tribal Hidage is difficult to date precisely; it may have been written down in Wulfhere&#x27;s reign, but other suggested origins include the reign of Offa of Mercia, or Edwin or Oswiu of Northumbria.

==A convert king==

Britain had been Christianised under the Romans, but the incoming Anglo-Saxons practiced their indigenous religion (Anglo-Saxon paganism) and the church in Great Britain was limited to the surviving British kingdoms in Scotland and Wales, and the kingdom of Dumnonia in the southwest of England. Missionaries from Rome began converting the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity at the end of the 6th century, and this process was well under way in Penda&#x27;s reign, though Penda himself remained pagan throughout his life. Records survive of the baptism of other kings at this time—Cynegils of Wessex was baptised in about 640, for example, and Edwin of Northumbria was converted in the mid 620s. However, later kings, such as Cædwalla of Wessex, who ruled in the 680s, are recorded as pagan at their accession.

Bede writes that after Wulfhere became king: &quot;Free under their own king, they [the Mercians] gave willing allegiance to Christ their true king, so that they might win his eternal kingdom in heaven&quot;. While Wulfhere&#x27;s father had refused to convert to Christianity, and Peada had apparently converted in order to marry Oswiu&#x27;s daughter, the date and the circumstances of Wulfhere&#x27;s conversion are unknown. It has been suggested that he adopted Christianity as part of a settlement with Oswiu. Bede records that two years before Penda&#x27;s death, his son Peada converted to Christianity, influenced partly by Oswiu&#x27;s son Ealhfrith, who had married Peada&#x27;s sister Cyneburh. Peada brought a Christian mission into Mercia, and it is possible that this was when Wulfhere became a Christian. Wulfhere&#x27;s marriage to Eormenhild of Kent would have brought Mercia into close contact with the Christian kingdoms of Kent and Merovingian Gaul, which were connected by kinship and trade. The political and economic benefits of the marriage may therefore also have been a factor in Wulfhere&#x27;s Christianisation of his kingdom.

Wulfhere&#x27;s relationship with Bishop Wilfrid is recorded in Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;. During the years 667–69, while Wilfrid was at Ripon, Wulfhere frequently invited him to come to Mercia when there was need of the services of a bishop. According to Stephen, Wulfhere rewarded Wilfrid with &quot;many tracts of land&quot;, in which Wilfrid &quot;soon established minsters for servants of God&quot;.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Wulfhere endowed a major monastery at Medeshamstede, in modern Peterborough. The monastery had initially been endowed by Peada; for the dedication of Wulfhere&#x27;s gift both Archbishop Deusdedit (died 664), and Bishop Jaruman (held office from 663), were present. The endowment was signed by Wulfhere and Oswiu, and by Sigehere and Sæbbi, the Kings of Essex.

==West Saxons, South Saxons and Hwicce==
In 661, Wulfhere is recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; as harrying Ashdown, in West Saxon territory. The Gewisse, thought to be the original group from which the West Saxons came, appear to have originally settled in the upper Thames valley, and what records survive of the 6th century show them active in that region. The Mercian resurgence under Wulfhere placed them under severe pressure. Also in the early 660s, the West Saxon see of Dorchester, in the same area, was divided, and a new bishopric set up at Winchester. This decision was probably a reaction to the advance of the Mercians into the traditional heartland of the West Saxons, leaving Dorchester dangerously close to the border. Within a few years, the Dorchester see was abandoned; the exact date is not known, but it was probably in the mid 660s.

In addition to the attack on Ashdown, Wulfhere raided the Isle of Wight in 661. He subsequently gave both the island and the territory of the Meonware, which lay along the river Meon, on the mainland north of the Isle of Wight, to his godson King Æthelwealh of the South Saxons. It seems likely that the ruling dynasty on the island found these arrangements acceptable to some degree, since the West Saxons, under Cædwalla, exterminated the whole family when they launched their own attack on the island in 686. After the conquest of the Isle of Wight, Wulfhere ordered the priest Eoppa to provide baptism to the inhabitants. According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, this was the first time Christian baptism had reached the island.

In the early 670s, Cenwealh of Wessex died, and perhaps as a result of the stress caused by Wulfhere&#x27;s military activity the West Saxon kingdom fragmented and came to be ruled by underkings, according to Bede. Eventually these underkings were defeated and the kingdom reunited, probably by Cædwalla but possibly by Centwine. A decade after Wulfhere&#x27;s death, the West Saxons under Cædwalla began an aggressive expansion to the east, reversing much of the Mercian advance.

In addition to being Wulfhere&#x27;s godson, King Æthelwealh of the South Saxons had a connection to the Mercians via marriage. His wife was Queen Eafe, the daughter of Eanfrith of the Hwicce, a tribe whose territory lay to the southwest of Mercia. The Hwicce had their own royal family, but it appears that at this date they were already subordinate to Wulfhere: the marriage between Æthelwealh and Eafe may well have taken place at Wulfhere&#x27;s court, since it is known Æthelwealh was converted there. The kingdom of the Hwicce is sometimes regarded as a creation of Penda&#x27;s, but it is equally likely that the kingdom existed independently of Mercia, and that Penda and Wulfhere&#x27;s increasing influence in the area represented an extension of Mercian power rather than the creation of a separate entity.

==East Anglia and the East Saxons==
In 664, Æthelwald of East Anglia died, and was succeeded by Ealdwulf, who reigned for fifty years. Almost nothing is known of Mercian relations with East Anglia during this time; East Anglia had previously been dominated by Northumbria, but there is no evidence that this continued after Wulfhere&#x27;s accession. Swithhelm of the East Saxons also died in 664; he was succeeded by his two sons, Sigehere and Sæbbi, and Bede describes their accession as &quot;rulers ... under Wulfhere, king of the Mercians&quot;. A plague the same year caused Sigehere and his people to recant their Christianity, and according to Bede, Wulfhere sent Jaruman, the bishop of Lichfield, to reconvert the East Saxons. Jaruman was not the first bishop of Lichfield; Bede mentions a predecessor, Trumhere, but nothing is known about Trumhere&#x27;s activities or who appointed him.

It is apparent from these events that Oswiu&#x27;s influence in the south had waned by this time, if not before, and that Wulfhere now dominated the area. This becomes even clearer in the next few years, as some time between 665 and 668 Wulfhere sold the see of London to Wine, who had been expelled from his West Saxon bishopric by Cenwealh. London fell within the East Saxons&#x27; territory in that period. From the archaeological evidence, it appears to be about this time that the Middle Saxon settlement in London began to expand significantly; the centre of Anglo-Saxon London was not at the old Roman centre, but about a mile west of that, near what is now the location of the Strand. Wulfhere may have been in control of the city when this expansion began.

==Kent, Surrey and Lindsey==
Eorcenberht was the king of Kent at Wulfhere&#x27;s accession, and the two families became connected when Wulfhere married Eorcenberht&#x27;s daughter Eormenhild. In 664 Eorcenberht&#x27;s son Egbert succeeded to the Kentish throne. The situation in Kent at Egbert&#x27;s death in 673 is not clearly recorded. It appears that a year passed before Hlothhere, Egbert&#x27;s brother, became king. Wulfhere may have had an interest in the succession, as through his marriage to Eormenhild he was the uncle of Egbert&#x27;s two sons, Eadric and Wihtred. It has been speculated that Wulfhere acted as the effective ruler of Kent in the interregnum between Egbert&#x27;s death and Hlothhere&#x27;s accession. Another Mercian connection to Kent was through Merewalh, the king of the Magonsæte, and hence a subking under Wulfhere. Merewalh, who may have been Wulfhere&#x27;s brother, was married to Hlothhere&#x27;s sister, Eormenburh.

Surrey is not recorded as ever having been an independent kingdom, but was at least a province that was under the control of different neighbours at different times. It was ruled by Egbert until the early 670s, when a charter shows Wulfhere confirming a grant made to Bishop Eorcenwald by Frithuwold, a sub-king in Surrey, which may have extended north into modern Buckinghamshire. Frithuwold himself was probably married to Wilburh, Wulfhere&#x27;s sister. The charter, made from Thame, is dated between 673 and 675, and it was probably Egbert&#x27;s death that triggered Wulfhere&#x27;s intervention. A witness named Frithuric is recorded on a charter in the reign of Wulfhere&#x27;s successor, Æthelred, making a grant to the monastery of Peterborough, and the alliteration common in Anglo-Saxon dynasties has led to speculation that the two men may have both come from a Middle Anglian dynasty, with Wulfhere perhaps having placed Frithuwold on the throne of Surrey. The charter is witnessed by three other subkings, named Osric, Wigheard, and Æthelwold; their kingdoms are not identified but the charter mentions Sonning, a province in what is now eastern Berkshire, and it may be that one of these subkings was a ruler of the Sunningas, the people of that province. This would in turn imply Wulfhere&#x27;s domination of that province by that time.

Wulfhere&#x27;s influence among the Lindesfara, whose territory, Lindsey, lay in what is now Lincolnshire, is known from information about episcopal authority. At least one of the Mercian bishops of Lichfield is known to have exercised authority there: Wynfrith, who became bishop on Chad&#x27;s death in 672. In addition it is known that Wulfhere gave land at Barrow upon Humber, in Lindsey, to Chad, for a monastery. It is possible that Chad also had authority there as bishop, probably no later than 669. It may be that the political basis for Mercian episcopal control of the Lindesfara was laid early in Wulfhere&#x27;s reign, under Trumhere and Jaruman, the two bishops who preceded Chad.

==Defeat and death==
When Wulfhere attacked Oswiu&#x27;s son Ecgfrith in 674, he did so from a position of strength. Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; says that Wulfhere &quot;stirred up all the southern nations against [Northumbria]&quot;. Bede does not report the fighting, nor is it mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, but according to Stephen, Ecgfrith defeated Wulfhere, forcing him to surrender Lindsey, and to pay tribute.

Wulfhere survived the defeat but evidently lost some degree of control over the south as a result; in 675, Æscwine, one of the kings of the West Saxons, fought him at Biedanheafde. It is not known where this battle was, or who was the victor. Henry of Huntingdon, a 12th-century historian who had access to versions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; now lost, believed that Mercians had been the victors in a &quot;terrible battle&quot; and remarks upon Wulfhere having inherited &quot;the valour of his father and grandfather&quot;. Kirby, however, presumes Æscwine was sufficiently successful to break Wulfhere&#x27;s hold over Wessex.

Wulfhere died later in 675. The cause of death, according to Henry of Huntingdon, was disease. He would have been in his mid-thirties. His widow, Eormenhild, is thought to have later become the abbess of Ely. Æthelred, Wulfhere&#x27;s brother, succeeded to the throne and reigned for nearly thirty years. Æthelred recovered Lindsey from the Northumbrians a few years after his accession, but he was generally unable to maintain the domination of the south achieved by Wulfhere.

==Marriage and children==
At an unrecorded date Wulfhere married Eormenhild (&quot;alias&quot; Ermenilda, etc.), a daughter of Eorcenberht, King of Kent, who survived him and is thought after his death to have become the Abbess of Ely. No issue from the marriage are recorded in the earliest sources, however the following children are recorded by various other sources:
*Coenred, King of Mercia from 704 to 709, is recorded in John of Worcester&#x27;s 12th-century chronicle as Wulfhere&#x27;s son. 
*Berhtwald, a sub-king who is recorded as a nephew of Æthelred, 
*Werburh (&quot;alias&quot; Werburga, etc.), recorded in an 11th-century manuscript as a daughter of Wulfhere.
*Saint Wulfad, who having been led by a white hart whilst out hunting in a forest with his brother Ruffin, to the hermitage of Saint Chad, was converted by that saint to Christianity. This caused great displeasure of his father, who had relapsed to paganry, and slew both his sons for their actions. Wulfad was slain by his father at Stone, in Staffordshire, and Ruffin at Burston. Their mother founded Stone Priory on the spot of the burial of both her sons.
*Ruffin, slain by his father at Burston, for having converted to Christianity.

<text>Roma is a rural town and locality in the Maranoa Region, Queensland, Australia. It is the administrative centre of the Maranoa Region. The town was incorporated in 1867 and is named after Lady Diamantina Bowen (née di Roma), the wife of Sir George Bowen, the Governor of Queensland at the time. In the , the locality of Roma had a population of 6,838 people.

== Geography ==

Roma is in the Maranoa district of South West Queensland. It is situated at the junction of the Warrego and Carnarvon highways. It is also a major town on the Western Railway Line from Toowoomba and Brisbane. 

It is the centre of a rich pastoral and wheat-growing district. 

== History ==
=== Mandandanji ===
Prior to British colonisation, the Aboriginal peoples of the Mandandanji Nation occupied this region. Mandandanji (also known as Mandandanyi, Mandandanjdji, Kogai) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Mandandanji people. The Mandandanji language region is within the local government boundaries of the Maranoa Region, particularly Roma, Yuleba and Surat, then east towards Chinchilla and south-west towards Mitchell and St George.

=== British exploration ===
The first documented British explorers to enter the region were Sir Thomas Mitchell and Edmund Kennedy on their 1846 expedition. Mitchell named a nearby hill Mount Abundance due to the rich plains he encountered around what is now Roma. He called these plains the Fitzroy Downs in honour of the newly appointed Governor of New South Wales, Charles Augustus FitzRoy. 

Mitchell and Kennedy encountered a community of around 200 Aboriginal people in this vicinity. After initial friendly communication, hostilities arose with Kennedy&#x27;s men dispersing a group of Mandandanji after they tried to burn down the explorer&#x27;s encampment.

=== Arrival of British pastoralists and frontier conflict ===
When Mitchell returned to Sydney from his expedition, he encouraged his friend and head colonial government bureaucrat, William Macpherson, to take up land on the Fitzroy Downs. Macpherson&#x27;s son, Allan Macpherson, subsequently took 20 men and around 10,000 head of sheep and cattle from his property at Keera on the Gwydir River and headed for the Fitzroy Downs. In October 1847, he established the Mount Abundance pastoral station, which covered 400,000 acres from Muckadilla Creek on the west to Bungil Creek on the east. The township of Roma now stands on the part of the station where Macpherson decided to graze his cattle.

In August 1848, James Blyth attempted to establish a sheep station on Bungil Creek but the resident Mandandanji drove him off, spearing Blyth in the leg, killing his stockman and taking 3,000 of his sheep. This incident was the start of a lengthy war between the Aboriginal people of the area and the colonists. In late 1848, Macpherson had several skirmishes with Aboriginal people around Bungil Creek, killing an indeterminate number. By April 1849 the Mandandanji had killed seven of Macpherson&#x27;s stockmen, and the local Crown Lands Commissioner, John Durbin, with his contingent of mounted Border Police troopers was called in to give armed assistance. Despite this, Macpherson was defeated and forced to abandon his Mount Abundance station in May 1849.

Upon their exit, Macpherson and Durbin requested the government to mobilise the newly formed Native Police force to eliminate Aboriginal resistance in the region. Subsequently, in July 1849, Frederick Walker led his Native Police troopers against the &quot;Fitzroy Downs blacks&quot;, shooting many
during a large skirmish. In late 1850, the Mandandanji regrouped to attack Paddy McEnroe who had attempted to re-establish the Mount Abundance pastoral station. They killed one of his shepherds, burnt down a hut and took 400 cattle. Roderick Mitchell, the local Crown Lands Commissioner who had replaced Durbin, led a reprisal raid consisting of his police troopers and nearby squatter colonists, which recovered the cattle and killed 13 Aborigines.

In 1851, a large Native Police barracks was established at nearby Wondai Gumbal which housed up to 35 troopers. These troopers under officers George Fulford, James Skelton and Richard Dempster, conducted several patrols of the Mount Abundance area, shooting Aborigines when hostile contact was encountered. In November 1852, Mandandanji resistance on the Fitzroy Downs was finally crushed when Skelton dispersed with &quot;severe means&quot; a large group of Aborigines, killing at least six including Mandandanji leader Possum Murray (Bussamarai).

In 1858, the Mount Abundance pastoral station was sold to Stephen Spencer who was able to peacefully re-occupy the property with his family, 13 stockmen and 1,000 head of cattle. A new Native Police barracks was formed in 1859 on Bungil Creek under Sub-Lieutenant William Morehead which ensured British control of the region.

=== Township of Roma ===
In 1862, the Government of Queensland issued instructions for a town to be created in the Maranoa Region. Surveyors Robert Austin and A.C. Gregory chose a site adjacent to Bungil Creek on Stephen Spencer&#x27;s Mount Abundance pastoral station. This site became the township of Roma. Initially consisting of nothing more than three public houses, Roma was named after Lady Diamantina Bowen (Contessa Diamantina di Roma), wife of the first Governor of Queensland, George Bowen.



In 1863 Samuel Symons Bassett brought Queensland&#x27;s vine cuttings to Roma and established the Romavilla Winery in 1866 on Bungil Creek north of Roma.

In 1864, Reverend Adam McIntyre of the Free Church of Scotland commenced services at pastoral stations in the Maranoa district with the intention that he would be established as a permanent minister in Roma. However, on 22 May 1866 he died at Brucedale pastoral station on Bungil Creek south-east of Roma (), now in Tingun .

Captain Starlight, a cattle rustler, was tried and acquitted in the Roma Courthouse in February 1873. 

Roma State School, the first school in Roma, opened on 21 March 1870 and closed on 31 December 1986.

St John&#x27;s School was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1881.

Roma was the site of Australia&#x27;s first oil and gas discoveries.

During World War II, Roma was the location of RAAF No.22 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 29 August 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

Roma Special School opened on 25 January 1982 and closed on 31 December 1995.

In 2004, Roma had a low unemployment rate of 2.9%, which is among the lowest unemployment rates in Australia. 68.5% of the people in the labour force living in Roma were employed full-time, with 21.9% working on a part-time basis.

The Roma State College opened on 1 January 2006 as an amalgamation of Roma Junior School and Roma Middle School, and the addition of a new senior component.

In 2010, a Santos project study investigated the possibility of introducing treated CSG produce water into Roma&#x27;s existing underground aquifer which supplies the town&#x27;s water needs, including drinking water The Roma Managed Aquifer Recharge Study is the first of its kind in Australia. It is also considered experimental in nature as the risks are largely unknown. The Roma CSG Field pilot trial (Hermitage) Stage 4 is in operation (Completed Q4 2012) and Roma CSG Field (The Bend) Stage 4 operation is due to commence Q3/Q4 2014. The project will allow for the injection of up to 24 ML/d of treated coal seam gas water into the Gubberamunda Sandstone aquifer for up to 20 years. Water bores have been shut down and hence been restarted at nearby Wallumbilla due to methane being detected in the Gubberamunda Sandstone aquifer (2014).

== Demographics ==
In the , the locality of Roma had a population of 6,848 people. 78.2% of the people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were the Philippines 2.4%, New Zealand 1.6%, England 1.1%, India 1.1% and South Africa 0.5%. 83.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tagalog 1.4%, Filipino 0.7%, Punjabi 0.7%, Mandarin 0.4% and Afrikaans 0.2%.

== Climate ==
Roma experiences a semi-arid influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with hot, moderately rainy summers and mild, dry winters with occasional frosts. Average maxima range from to in July; modified by its position on the far south of the Carnarvon Range above sea level. Rainfall is mild, averaging , and peaks in summer due to frequent showers and thunderstorms. Although the town is too far inland to be affected by tropical cyclones and monsoonal rain depressions, on 2 March 2010, of rain fell, causing significant flooding in the town. Extremes have ranged from on 3 January 2014 to on 10 August 1995.

=== Flooding ===
The town is situated on Bungil Creek, a tributary of the Condamine River. In March 2010, Roma experienced its worst floods in over 100 years. Flooding also occurred in April 2011, a year of record rainfall in Roma. In early February 2012, Roma was devastated by its worst floods in history, eclipsing the level reached in 2010; 444 homes were inundated, twice as many that were flooded in the two previous years.

Having experienced three successive years of flooding, in May 2012, one insurer, Suncorp, announced it would not issue new policies to Roma residents, unless action was taken to mitigate the flood risk in Roma.

== Industry and economy ==
Roma is the major provisional centre for the Maranoa District, South West Queensland for government and industry business. It is on the western fringe of the Surat Basin energy / resources boom.

=== Agriculture ===
The Maranoa&#x27;s agriculture industry is worth approximately $620 million annually, 64.3% being generated from crops. 58.7% of businesses in the Maranoa are in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, which employs 32.7% of the region&#x27;s workforce. 2005 was a record year for Roma saleyards processing 390,000 head of cattle. Roma is home to the largest store cattle saleyards in the Southern Hemisphere. Saledays are Tuesday (for the big sales) and Thursday (for the fat cattle) Forestry plantations include Hardwood and Cypress Pines. Roma and the Maranoa region is home to Australia&#x27;s most active native Cypress Pine sawmilling.

<doc id="145325" wikidata="Q4612" url="?curid=145325" title="Marlene Dietrich">
<text>Marie Magdalene &quot;Marlene&quot; Dietrich (, ; 27 December 1901 – 6 May 1992) was a German and American actress and singer whose career spanned nearly seven decades.

In 1920s Berlin, Dietrich performed on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola Lola in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1930) brought her international acclaim and a contract with Paramount Pictures. She starred in many Hollywood films, including six iconic roles directed by Sternberg: &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930) (her only Academy Award nomination), &quot;Dishonored&quot; (1931), &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; and &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (both 1932), &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; (1934), &quot;The Devil Is a Woman&quot; (1935). She successfully traded on her glamorous persona and exotic looks, and became one of the era&#x27;s highest-paid actresses. Throughout World War II, she was a high-profile entertainer in the United States. Although she delivered notable performances in several post-war films, including Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;A Foreign Affair&quot; (1948), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957), Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958), and Stanley Kramer&#x27;s &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), she spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer.

Dietrich was known for her humanitarian efforts during World War II, housing German and French exiles, providing financial support and advocating their American citizenship. For her work on improving morale on the front lines during the war, she received several honors from the United States, France, Belgium, and Israel. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth greatest female screen legend of classic Hollywood cinema.

== Early life ==
Marlene Dietrich was born Marie Magdalene Dietrich on 27 December 1901 at Leberstraße 65 in the neighborhood of Rote Insel in Schöneberg, now a district of Berlin. Her mother, Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josefine (&quot;née&quot; Felsing), was from an affluent Berlin family who owned a jewelry and clock-making firm. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, was a police lieutenant. Dietrich had one sibling, Elisabeth (5 February 1900 – 8 May 1973). Dietrich&#x27;s father was born on 26 August 1867 and died in August 1908. His best friend, Eduard von Losch, an aristocratic first lieutenant in the Grenadiers, courted Wilhelmina and married her in 1914, but he died in July 1916 from injuries sustained during the First World War. Von Losch never officially adopted the Dietrich sisters, so Dietrich&#x27;s surname was never von Losch, as has sometimes been said.

Dietrich&#x27;s family nicknamed her &quot;Lena&quot;, &quot;Lene&quot;, or &quot;Leni&quot; (). Aged about 11, she combined her first two names to form the name &quot;Marlene.&quot; Dietrich attended the Auguste-Viktoria Girls&#x27; School from 1907 to 1917 and graduated from the Victoria-Luise-Schule (today Goethe-Gymnasium) in Berlin-Wilmersdorf in 1918. She studied the violin and became interested in theater and poetry as a teenager. A wrist injury curtailed her dreams of becoming a concert violinist, but by 1922 she had her first job playing violin in a pit orchestra for silent films at a Berlin cinema. She was fired after four weeks.

The earliest professional stage appearances by Dietrich were as a chorus girl on tour with Guido Thielscher&#x27;s Girl-Kabarett vaudeville-style entertainments and in Rudolf Nelson revues in Berlin. In 1922, Dietrich auditioned unsuccessfully for theatrical director and impresario Max Reinhardt&#x27;s drama academy; however, she soon found herself working in his theatres as a chorus girl and playing small roles in dramas.

=== Career beginnings ===
Dietrich&#x27;s film debut was a small part in the film &quot;The Little Napoleon&quot; (1923). She met her future husband Rudolf Sieber on the set of &quot;Tragedy of Love&quot; in 1923. Dietrich and Sieber were married in a civil ceremony in Berlin on 17 May 1923. Her only child, daughter Maria Elisabeth Sieber, was born on 13 December 1924.

Dietrich continued to work on stage and in film both in Berlin and Vienna throughout the 1920s. On stage, she had roles of varying importance in Frank Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot; and &quot;Misalliance&quot;. It was in musicals and revues such as &quot;Broadway&quot;, &quot;Es Liegt in der Luft&quot;, and &quot;Zwei Krawatten&quot;, however, that she attracted the most attention. By the late 1920s, Dietrich was also playing sizable parts on screen, including roles in &quot;Café Elektric&quot; (1927), &quot;I Kiss Your Hand, Madame&quot; (1928), and &quot;The Ship of Lost Souls&quot; (1929).

== Career ==
=== Association with von Sternberg ===

In 1929, Dietrich landed her breakthrough role of Lola Lola, a cabaret singer who caused the downfall of a hitherto respectable schoolmaster (played by Emil Jannings), in the UFA production of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1930) shot at Babelsberg film studios. Josef von Sternberg directed the film and thereafter took credit for having &quot;discovered&quot; Dietrich. The film introduced Dietrich&#x27;s signature song &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot;, which she recorded for Electrola. She made further recordings in the 1930s for Polydor and Decca Records.

In 1930, on the strength of &quot;The Blue Angel&#x27;s&quot; international success, and with encouragement and promotion from Josef von Sternberg, who was established in Hollywood, Dietrich moved to the United States under contract to Paramount Pictures, the U.S. film distributor of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;. The studio sought to market Dietrich as a German answer to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s Swedish star Greta Garbo. Sternberg welcomed her with gifts, including a green Rolls-Royce Phantom II. The car later appeared in their first U.S. film &quot;Morocco&quot;.

Dietrich starred in six films directed by von Sternberg at Paramount between 1930 and 1935. Von Sternberg worked effectively with Dietrich to create the image of a glamorous and mysterious femme fatale. He encouraged her to lose weight and coached her intensively as an actress. She willingly followed his, sometimes imperious, direction in a way that a number of other performers resisted.

In &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930) with Gary Cooper, Dietrich was again cast as a cabaret singer. The film is best remembered for the sequence in which she performs a song dressed in a man&#x27;s white tie and kisses another woman, both provocative for the era. The film earned Dietrich her only Academy Award nomination. &quot;Morocco&quot; was followed by &quot;Dishonored&quot; (1931) with Victor McLaglen, a major success with Dietrich cast as a Mata Hari-like spy.
&quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932) with Anna May Wong, which was dubbed by the critics &quot;&quot;Grand Hotel&quot; on wheels&quot;, was another major success, earning $1.5 million in worldwide rentals.

Dietrich and von Sternberg again collaborated on the romance &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (1932) with Cary Grant. Dietrich worked without von Sternberg for the first time in three years in the romantic drama &quot;Song of Songs&quot; (1933), playing a naïve German peasant, under the direction of Rouben Mamoulian. Dietrich and Sternberg&#x27;s last two films, &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; (1934) with John Davis Lodge and &quot;The Devil Is a Woman&quot; (1935)—the most stylized of their collaborations—were their lowest-grossing films. Dietrich later remarked that she was at her most beautiful in &quot;The Devil Is a Woman&quot;.

Von Sternberg is known for his exceptional skill in lighting and photographing Dietrich to optimum effect, so much so, that even 50 years later, one of &quot;Shanghai Express&#x27;s&quot; production stills became the inspiration of the cover of rock band Queen&#x27;s album &quot;Queen II&quot; which was integrated into the music video of their single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

His signature use of light and shadow, including the impact of light passed through a veil or slatted window blinds, combined with the scrupulous attention to set design and costumes makes the films they made together among cinema&#x27;s most visually stylish.

Critics still vigorously debate how much of the credit belonged to von Sternberg and how much to Dietrich, but most would agree that neither consistently reached such heights again after Paramount fired von Sternberg and the two ceased working together.

The collaboration of one actress and director creating seven films is still unmatched in motion pictures, with the possible exception of Katharine Hepburn and George Cukor, who made ten films together over a much longer period but which were not created for Hepburn the way the last six von Sternberg/Dietrich collaborations were.

=== The later 1930s ===
Dietrich&#x27;s first film after the end of her partnership with von Sternberg was Frank Borzage&#x27;s &quot;Desire&quot; (1936) with Gary Cooper, a commercial success that gave Dietrich an opportunity to try her hand at romantic comedy. Her next project, &quot;I Loved a Soldier&quot; (1936), ended in shambles when the film was scrapped several weeks into production due to script problems, scheduling confusion and the studio&#x27;s decision to fire the producer Ernst Lubitsch.

Extravagant offers lured Dietrich away from Paramount to make her first color film &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; (1936) for independent producer David O. Selznick, for which she received $200,000, and to Britain for Alexander Korda&#x27;s production, &quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937), at a salary of $450,000, which made her one of the best paid film stars of the time. While both films performed decently at the box office, her vehicles were costly to produce and her public popularity had declined. By this time, Dietrich placed 126th in box office rankings, and American film exhibitors proclaimed her &quot;box office poison&quot; in May 1938, a distinction she shared with Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Mae West, Katharine Hepburn, Norma Shearer, Dolores del Río, and Fred Astaire among others.
While in London, Dietrich later said in interviews, she was approached by Nazi Party officials and offered lucrative contracts, should she agree to return to be a foremost film star in Nazi Germany. She refused their offers and applied for U.S. citizenship in 1937. She returned to Paramount to make &quot;Angel&quot; (1937), another romantic comedy directed by Ernst Lubitsch; the film was poorly received, leading Paramount to buy out the remainder of Dietrich&#x27;s contract.

Dietrich, with encouragement from Josef von Sternberg, accepted producer Joe Pasternak&#x27;s offer to play against type in her first film in two years: that of the cowboy saloon girl, Frenchie, in the western-comedy &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939), with James Stewart. This was a significantly less well paid role than she had been accustomed to.

The bawdy role revived her career and &quot;See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have&quot;, a song she introduced in the film, became a hit when she recorded it for Decca. She played similar types in &quot;Seven Sinners&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (1942), both with John Wayne.

=== World War II ===
Dietrich was known to have strong political convictions and the mind to speak them. In the late 1930s, Dietrich created a fund with Billy Wilder and several other exiles to help Jews and dissidents escape from Germany. In 1937, her entire salary for &quot;Knight Without Armor&quot; ($450,000) was put into escrow to help the refugees. In 1939, she became an American citizen and renounced her German citizenship.
In December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II, and Dietrich became one of the first public figures to help sell war bonds. She toured the U.S. from January 1942 to September 1943 (appearing before 250,000 troops on the Pacific Coast leg of her tour alone) and was reported to have sold more war bonds than any other star.

During two extended tours for the USO in 1944 and 1945, she performed for Allied troops in Algeria, Italy, the UK, France and Heerlen in the Netherlands, then entered Germany with Generals James M. Gavin and George S. Patton. When asked why she had done this, in spite of the obvious danger of being within a few kilometers of German lines, she replied, &quot;aus Anstand&quot;—&quot;out of decency&quot;. Wilder later remarked that she was at the front lines more than Dwight Eisenhower. Her revue, with Danny Thomas as her opening act for the first tour, included songs from her films, performances on her musical saw (a skill taught to her by Igo Sym that she had originally acquired for stage appearances in Berlin in the 1920s) and a &quot;mindreading&quot; act that her friend Orson Welles had taught her for his &quot;Mercury Wonder Show&quot;. Dietrich would inform the audience that she could read minds and ask them to concentrate on whatever came into their minds. Then she would walk over to a soldier and earnestly tell him, &quot;Oh, think of something else. I can&#x27;t possibly talk about &quot;that&quot;!&quot; American church papers reportedly published stories complaining about this part of Dietrich&#x27;s act.

In 1944, the Morale Operations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) initiated the Musak project, musical propaganda broadcasts designed to demoralize enemy soldiers. Dietrich, the only performer who was made aware that her recordings would be for OSS use, recorded a number of songs in German for the project, including &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, a favorite of soldiers on both sides of the conflict. Major General William J. Donovan, head of the OSS, wrote to Dietrich, &quot;I am personally deeply grateful for your generosity in making these recordings for us.&quot;

At the war&#x27;s end in Europe, Dietrich reunited with her sister Elisabeth and her sister&#x27;s husband and son. They had resided in the German village of Belsen throughout the war years, running a cinema frequented by Nazi officers and officials who oversaw the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Dietrich&#x27;s mother remained in Berlin during the war, while Dietrich vouched for her sister and her sister&#x27;s husband, sheltering them from possible prosecution as Nazi collaborators. However, Dietrich later omitted the existence of her sister and her sister&#x27;s son from all accounts of her life, completely disowning them and claiming to be an only child.

Dietrich received the Medal of Freedom in November 1947, for her &quot;extraordinary record entertaining troops overseas during the war&quot;. She said this was her proudest accomplishment. She was also awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French government for her wartime work.

=== Later film career ===
While Dietrich never fully regained her former screen profile, she continued performing in motion pictures, including appearances for directors such as Mitchell Leisen in &quot;Golden Earrings&quot; (1947), Billy Wilder in &quot;A Foreign Affair&quot; (1948) and Alfred Hitchcock in &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950). Her appearances in the 1950s included films such as Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Rancho Notorious&quot;, (1952) and Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957). She appeared in Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958). Dietrich had a kind of platonic love for Welles, whom she considered a genius. Her last substantial film role was in &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961) directed by Stanley Kramer; she also presented the narrative for the documentary &quot;Black Fox: The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1962. She cut the ceremonial ribbon to celebrate the grand opening of the Paris Theater in New York City in 1948.

=== Stage and cabaret ===

From the early 1950s until the mid-1970s, Dietrich worked almost exclusively as a cabaret artist, performing live in large theatres in major cities worldwide.

In 1953, Dietrich was offered $30,000 per week to appear live at the Sahara Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. The show was short, consisting only of a few songs associated with her. Her daringly sheer &quot;nude dress&quot;—a heavily beaded evening gown of silk soufflé, which gave the illusion of transparency—designed by Jean Louis, attracted a lot of publicity. This engagement was so successful that she was signed to appear at the Café de Paris in London the following year; her Las Vegas contracts were also renewed.

Dietrich employed Burt Bacharach as her musical arranger starting in the mid-1950s; together, they refined her nightclub act into a more ambitious theatrical one-woman show with an expanded repertoire. Her repertoire included songs from her films as well as popular songs of the day. Bacharach&#x27;s arrangements helped to disguise Dietrich&#x27;s limited vocal range—she was a contralto—and allowed her to perform her songs to maximum dramatic effect; together, they recorded four albums and several singles between 1957 and 1964. In a TV interview in 1971, she credited Bacharach with giving her the &quot;inspiration&quot; to perform during those years.

Bacharach then felt he needed to devote his time fully to songwriting. But she had also come to rely on him in order to perform, and wrote about his leaving in her memoir:
She often performed the first part of her show in one of her body-hugging dresses and a swansdown coat, and change to top hat and tails for the second half of the performance. This allowed her to sing songs usually associated with male singers, like &quot;One for My Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face&quot;.

&quot;She ... transcends her material,&quot; according to Peter Bogdanovich. &quot;Whether it&#x27;s a flighty old tune like &#x27;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love, Baby&#x27; ... a schmaltzy German love song, &#x27;Das Lied ist Aus&#x27; or a French one &quot;, she lends each an air of the aristocrat, yet she never patronises ... A folk song, &#x27;Go &#x27;Way From My Window&#x27; has never been sung with such passion, and in her hands &#x27;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&#x27; is not just another anti-war lament but a tragic accusation against us all.&quot;

Francis Wyndham offered a more critical appraisal of the phenomenon of Dietrich in concert. He wrote in 1964: &quot;What she does is neither difficult nor diverting, but the fact that she does it at all fills the onlookers with wonder ... It takes two to make a conjuring trick: the illusionist&#x27;s sleight of hand and the stooge&#x27;s desire to be deceived. To these necessary elements (her own technical competence and her audience&#x27;s sentimentality) Marlene Dietrich adds a third—the mysterious force of her belief in her own magic. Those who find themselves unable to share this belief tend to blame themselves rather than her.&quot;

Her use of body-sculpting undergarments, nonsurgical temporary facelifts (tape), expert makeup and wigs, combined with careful stage lighting, helped to preserve Dietrich&#x27;s glamorous image as she grew older. Dietrich had owned a penthouse in New York City at 993 Park Avenue since 1959.

Dietrich&#x27;s return to West Germany in 1960 for a concert tour received a mixed reception—despite a consistently negative press, vociferous protest by Germans who felt she had betrayed her homeland, and two bomb threats, her performance attracted huge crowds. During her performances at Berlin&#x27;s Titania Palast theatre, protesters chanted, &quot;Marlene Go Home!&quot; On the other hand, Dietrich was warmly welcomed by other Germans, including Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt, who was, like Dietrich, an opponent of the Nazis who had lived in exile during their rule. The tour was an artistic triumph, but a financial failure. She was left emotionally drained by the hostility she encountered, and she left convinced never to visit again. East Germany, however, received her well. She also undertook a tour of Israel around the same time, which was well-received; she sang some songs in German during her concerts, including, from 1962, a German version of Pete Seeger&#x27;s anti-war anthem &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone&quot;, thus breaking the unofficial taboo against the use of German in Israel. She would become the first woman and German to receive the Israeli Medallion of Valor in 1965, &quot;in recognition for her courageous adherence to principle and consistent record of friendship for the Jewish people&quot;. &quot;Dietrich in London&quot;, a concert album, was recorded during the run of her 1964 engagement at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre.

She performed on Broadway twice (in 1967 and 1968) and received a Special Tony Award in 1968. In November 1972, &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;, a version of Dietrich&#x27;s Broadway show titled &quot;An Evening with Marlene Dietrich&quot;, was filmed in London. She was paid $250,000 for her cooperation but was unhappy with the result. The show was broadcast in the UK on the BBC and in the U.S. on CBS in January 1973.

Dietrich continued with a busy performance schedule until September 1975. When Clive Hirschhorn asked her why she continued to perform, she said, &quot;Do you think this is glamorous? That this is a great life, and that I do it for my health? Well, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s hard work. And who would work if they didn&#x27;t have to?&quot;

In her 60s and 70s, Dietrich&#x27;s health declined: she survived cervical cancer in 1965 and suffered from poor circulation in her legs. Dietrich became increasingly dependent on painkillers and alcohol. A stage fall at the Shady Grove Music Fair in Maryland in 1973 injured her left thigh, necessitating skin grafts to allow the wound to heal. She fractured her right leg in August 1974.

=== Paris years ===
Dietrich&#x27;s show business career largely ended on 29 September 1975, when she fell on the stage and broke a thigh bone during a performance in Sydney, Australia. The following year, her husband, Rudolf Sieber, died of cancer on 24 June 1976. Dietrich&#x27;s final on-camera film appearance was a brief appearance in &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; (1978), starring David Bowie and directed by David Hemmings, in which she sang the title song.

Dietrich withdrew to her apartment at 12 in Paris. She spent the final 13 years of her life mostly bedridden, allowing only a select few—including family and employees—to enter the apartment. During this time, she was a prolific letter-writer and phone-caller. Her autobiography &quot;&quot; (&quot;Take Just My Life&quot;), was published in 1979.

In 1982, Dietrich agreed to participate in a documentary film about her life, &quot;Marlene&quot; (1984), but refused to be filmed. The film&#x27;s director is her former co-star from &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), Maximilian Schell, and even with that familiarity, he was still only allowed to record her voice. Schell used his interviews with her as the basis for the film, set to a collage of film clips from her career. The film won several European film prizes and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary in 1984. &quot;Newsweek&quot; named it &quot;a unique film, perhaps the most fascinating and affecting documentary ever made about a great movie star&quot;.

In 1988, Dietrich recorded spoken introductions to songs for a nostalgia album by Udo Lindenberg.

In an interview with the German magazine &quot;&quot; in November 2005, Dietrich&#x27;s daughter and grandson said Dietrich was politically active during these years. She kept in contact with world leaders by telephone, including Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Margaret Thatcher, running up a monthly bill of over US$3,000. In 1990, her appeal to save the Babelsberg Studios from closure was broadcast on BBC Radio. She had spoken on television via telephone on the occasion of the fall of the Berlin Wall the previous year. Also in spring 1990, she spoke on French forces radio station addressing her fellow Berliners in Germany about her then most recent conversation with French president Mitterrand regarding his promise to her that Berlin would be the capital city of a united Germany later on—at that point in time, a quite appealing but non-official French presidential statement.

== Death and estate ==
On 6 May 1992, Dietrich died of kidney failure at her flat in Paris at age 90. Her funeral was a requiem mass conducted at the Roman Catholic church of in Paris on 14 May 1992. Dietrich&#x27;s funeral service was attended by approximately 1,500 mourners in the church itself—including ambassadors from Germany, Russia, the US, the UK, and other countries—with thousands more outside. Her closed coffin, draped in the French flag, rested beneath the altar and was adorned with a simple bouquet of white wildflowers and roses from the French President François Mitterrand. Three medals, including France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;honneur and the U.S. Medal of Freedom were displayed at the foot of the coffin, military style, for a ceremony symbolizing the sense of duty Dietrich embodied in her career as an actress, and in her personal fight against Nazism. The officiating priest remarked: &quot;Everyone knew her life as an artist of film and song, and everyone knew her tough stands ... She lived like a soldier and would like to be buried like a soldier&quot;. By coincidence, her picture was used in the Cannes Film Festival poster that year which was pasted up all over Paris.

In her will Dietrich expressed the wish to be buried in her birthplace Berlin, near her family. Her body was flown there to fulfill her wish on 16 May 1992. Her coffin was draped in an American flag befitting her status as an American. As her coffin traveled through Berlin bystanders threw flowers onto it, a fitting tribute because Dietrich loved flowers, even saving the flowers thrown to her at the end of her performances for use in subsequent shows. Dietrich was interred at the Städtischer Friedhof III, Schöneberg, close by the grave of her mother Josefine von Losch, and near the house where she was born.

On 24 October 1993, the main portion of Dietrich&#x27;s estate (on which the U.S. institutions showed no interest), was sold to the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek, where it became the core of the exhibition at the Filmmuseum Berlin. The collection includes: over 3,000 textile items from the 1920s to the 1990s, including film and stage costumes as well as over a thousand items from Dietrich&#x27;s personal wardrobe; 15,000 photographs, by Sir Cecil Beaton, Horst P. Horst, George Hurrell, Lord Snowdon and Edward Steichen; 300,000 pages of documents, including correspondence with Burt Bacharach, Yul Brynner, Maurice Chevalier, Noël Coward, Jean Gabin, Ernest Hemingway, Karl Lagerfeld, Nancy and Ronald Reagan, Erich Maria Remarque, Josef von Sternberg, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder; as well as other items like film posters and sound recordings. The Marlene Dietrich Collection was sold to the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek for US$5 million, by Dietrich&#x27;s heirs.

The contents of Dietrich&#x27;s Manhattan apartment, along with other personal effects such as jewelry and items of clothing, were sold by public auction by Sotheby&#x27;s in Los Angeles in November 1997. Her former apartment located at 993 Park Avenue was sold for $615,000 in 1998.

== Personal life ==
Dietrich&#x27;s professional image was carefully crafted and maintained while her personal life was mostly hidden from the public. She was fluent in German, English, Italian and French. Dietrich, who was bisexual, enjoyed the thriving gay bars and drag balls of 1920s Berlin. Bars included the &quot;Mali und Igel,&quot; run by Elsa Conrad. She also defied conventional gender roles with her boxing at Turkish trainer and prizefighter Sabri Mahir&#x27;s boxing studio in Berlin, which opened to women in the late 1920s.
In May 1923 Dietrich married assistant director Rudolf Sieber, who later became an assistant director at Paramount Pictures in France, responsible for foreign language dubbing. Their only child, Maria Riva, was born in Berlin on 13 December 1924. Riva later became an actress, primarily working in television. When Maria gave birth to a son (John, later a famous production designer) in 1948, Dietrich was dubbed &quot;the world&#x27;s most glamorous grandmother&quot;. After Dietrich&#x27;s death, Riva published a candid biography of her mother, titled &quot;Marlene Dietrich&quot; (1992). In it Dietrich is shown as a cold, manipulative narcissist who treated Riva more like an assistant or extension of herself than a daughter.
Throughout her career, Dietrich had numerous affairs, some short-lived, some lasting decades, often overlapping and almost all known to her husband, to whom she was in the habit of passing the intimate letters from her lovers, sometimes with biting comments. When Dietrich arrived in Hollywood and filmed &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930), she had an affair with Gary Cooper, even though he was having another affair with Mexican actress Lupe Vélez. Vélez once said, &quot;If I had the opportunity to do so, I would tear out Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s eyes.&quot; Another of her affairs was with actor John Gilbert, known for his professional and personal connection to Greta Garbo. Gilbert&#x27;s untimely death was one of the most painful events of her life. Dietrich also had a brief affair with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., even though he was married to Joan Crawford at the time. During the production of &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, Dietrich started a love affair with co-star James Stewart, which ended after filming stopped. According to writer/director Peter Bogdanovich, Marlene Dietrich told him during an aircraft flight that she became pregnant as a result of the affair, but had a surreptitious abortion without telling Stewart. In 1938, Dietrich met and began a relationship with writer Erich Maria Remarque, and in 1941, the French actor Jean Gabin. He was probably the love of her life, but the relationship ended in 1948, for she desired that they live in New York and Gabin did not want to leave France.

In Paris, Dietrich had an affair with Suzanne Baulé, known as Frede, a coach and cabaret hostess whom she met in 1936 at the Monocle, a women&#x27;s nightclub on Boulevard Edgar-Quinet in Paris. The two women remained friends until the 1970s, as can be seen in the correspondence kept in the Marlene Dietrich archives in Berlin. In the early 1930s, Dietrich also had an affair with Cuban-American writer Mercedes de Acosta, who claimed to also be Greta Garbo&#x27;s lover. &quot;Sewing circle&quot; was a phrase used by Dietrich to describe the underground, closeted lesbian and bisexual film actresses and their relationships in Hollywood. In the supposed &quot;Marlene&#x27;s Sewing Circle&quot; several other names of other close friends are mentioned, such as Ann Warner (the wife of Jack L. Warner, one of the owners of the Warner studios), Lili Damita (an old friend of Marlene&#x27;s from Berlin and the wife of Errol Flynn), Claudette Colbert, and Dolores del Río (whom Dietrich considered the most beautiful woman in Hollywood). 
The French singer Édith Piaf was also one of Dietrich&#x27;s closest friends during her stay in Paris in the 1950s, with Dietrich serving as Piaf&#x27;s matron of honor at her wedding to Jacques Pills in 1952; there were rumors of something more than just friendship between them.

When Dietrich was in her 50s she had a relationship with actor Yul Brynner, which lasted more than a decade. Dietrich&#x27;s love life continued into her 70s. Her lovers included Errol Flynn, George Bernard Shaw, John F. Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, Michael Todd, Michael Wilding, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Frank Sinatra. Dietrich maintained her husband and his mistress first in Europe and later on a ranch in the San Fernando Valley, near Hollywood. Dietrich was raised in the German Lutheran tradition of Christianity, but she abandoned it as a result of her experiences as a teenager during World War I, after hearing preachers from both sides invoking God as their support. &quot;I lost my faith during the war and can&#x27;t believe they are all up there, flying around or sitting at tables, all those I&#x27;ve lost.&quot; Quoting Goethe in her autobiography, she wrote, &quot;If God created this world, he should review his plan.&quot;

 In an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1960, she said, &quot;I dress for the image. Not for myself, not for the public, not for fashion, not for men. If I dressed for myself I wouldn&#x27;t bother at all. Clothes bore me. I&#x27;d wear jeans. I adore jeans. I get them in a public store—men&#x27;s, of course; I can&#x27;t wear women&#x27;s trousers. But I dress for the profession.&quot; In 2017, Swarovski commissioned a $60,000 Art Deco-styled dress in the style of her &quot;nude dress&quot;, from Berlin-based fashion tech company ElektroCouture to honor Dietrich 25 years after her death. It contains 2,000 crystals in addition to 150 LED lights. ElektroCouture owner Lisa Lang said that the dress was inspired by electrical diagrams and correspondence that took place between the actress and fashion designer Jean Louis in 1958: &quot;She wanted a dress that glows, she wanted to be able to control it herself from the stage and she knew she could have died of an electric stroke had it ever been realized.&quot; The dress created by Lang&#x27;s company was featured in French-German broadcaster Arte&#x27;s documentary (″&quot;The Last Dress of Marlene Dietrich&quot;″).

Her public image included openly defying sexual norms, and she was known for her androgynous film roles and her bisexuality.

A significant volume of academic literature, especially since 1975, analyzes Dietrich&#x27;s image, as created by the film industry, within various theoretical frameworks, including that of psychoanalysis. Emphasis is placed, inter alia, on the &quot;fetishistic&quot; manipulation of the female image.
In 1992, a plaque was unveiled at in , the site of Dietrich&#x27;s birth. A postage stamp bearing her portrait was issued in Germany on 14 August 1997.

The main-belt asteroid 1010 Marlene, discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in 1923, was named in her honor.

For some Germans, Dietrich remained a controversial figure for having sided with the Allies during World War II. In 1996, after some debate, it was decided not to name a street after her in Berlin-Schöneberg, her birthplace. However, on 8 November 1997, the central was unveiled in Berlin to honour her. The commemoration reads: (&quot;Berlin world star of film and song. Dedication to freedom and democracy, to Berlin and Germany&quot;).

Dietrich was made an honorary citizen of Berlin on 16 May 2002.
Translated from German, her memorial plaque reads

The U.S. government awarded Dietrich the Medal of Freedom for her war work. Dietrich has been quoted as saying this was the honor of which she was proudest in her life. They also awarded her the Operation Entertainment Medal. The French government made her a (later upgraded to ) of the and a of the . Her other awards include the Medallion of Honor of the State of Israel, the Fashion Foundation of America award and a (Belgium).

Dietrich is referenced in a number of popular 20th century songs, including Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; (1935), Peter Sarstedt&#x27;s &quot;Where Do You Go To, My Lovely?&quot; (1969), Suzanne Vega&#x27;s &quot;Marlene on the Wall&quot; (1985), Peter Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s Favourite Poem&quot; (1989), and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Vogue&quot; (1990). She is the inspiration for the song &quot;Blue Heaven&quot; from Public Service Broadcasting&#x27;s 2021 album Bright Magic and the 2021 Black Midi album &quot;Cavalcade&quot; contains the song &quot;Marlene Dietrich&quot;.

In 2000, a German biopic, &quot;Marlene&quot;, was released. The biopic was directed by Joseph Vilsmaier and starred Katja Flint as Dietrich.

On 27 December 2017, she was given a Google Doodle on the 116th anniversary of her birth. The doodle was designed by American drag artist Sasha Velour, who cites Dietrich as a big inspiration due to her &quot;gender-bending&quot; fashion and political views. Sasha portrayed Marlene during her time at competitive reality series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;.

On 14 May 2020, she was part of an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; cover celebrating LGBTQ celebrities.

In 2023, artist William Kentridge included a drawing of Dietrich in his solo museum exhibition at The Broad in Los Angeles.

<doc id="145326" wikidata="Q332123" url="?curid=145326" title="Penda of Mercia">
<text>Penda (died 15 November 655) was a 7th-century king of Mercia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom in what is today the Midlands. A pagan at a time when Christianity was taking hold in many of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Penda took over the Severn Valley in 628 following the Battle of Cirencester before participating in the defeat of the powerful Northumbrian king Edwin at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633.

Nine years later, he defeated and killed Edwin&#x27;s eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; from this point he was probably the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the Mercian Supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. He repeatedly defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald&#x27;s successor and brother Oswiu and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed in the course of a final campaign against the Bernicians.

== Sources ==
The source for Penda&#x27;s life which can most securely be called the earliest, and which is the most detailed, is Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; (completed c. 731; chapters II.20, III.7, III.16–18, III.21, III.24). Penda also appears prominently in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, whose sources and so reliability for this period are unclear, and in the early ninth-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, which adds a little more possibly reliable information to Bede&#x27;s account. He seems also to be mentioned, as Panna ap Pyd, in the perhaps seventh-century Welsh praise-poem &quot;Marwnad Cynddylan&quot;, which says of Cynddylan: &#x27;pan fynivys mab pyd mor fu parawd&#x27; (&#x27;when the son of Pyd wished, how ready was he&#x27;). Penda and his family seem to have given their names to a number of places in the West Midlands, including Pinbury, Peddimore, and Pinvin.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name &quot;Penda&quot; is unknown. Penda of Mercia is the only person recorded in the comprehensive &quot;Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England&quot; with this name.

Suggestions for etymologies of the name are essentially divided between a Celtic and a Germanic origin.

The names of members of a Northumbrian [spiritual] brotherhood are recorded in the ninth-century &quot;Liber vitae Dunelmensis&quot;; the name &quot;Penda&quot; occurs in this list and is categorised as a British (Welsh) name. John T. Koch noted that &quot;Penda and a number of other royal names from early Anglian Mercia have more obvious Brythonic than German explanations, though they do not correspond to known Welsh names.&quot; These royal names include those of Penda&#x27;s father Pybba, and of his son Peada. It has been suggested that the firm alliance between Penda and various British princes might be the result of a &quot;racial cause.&quot;

Continental Germanic comparanda for the name include a feminine &quot;Penta&quot; (9th century) and a toponym &quot;Penti-lingen&quot;, suggesting an underlying personal name &quot;Pendi&quot;.

== Descent, beginning of reign, and battle with the West Saxons ==
Penda was a son of Pybba of Mercia and said to be an Icling, with a lineage purportedly extending back to Wōden. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; gives his descent as follows:

Penda was Pybba&#x27;s offspring, Pybba was Cryda&#x27;s offspring, Cryda Cynewald&#x27;s offspring, Cynewald Cnebba&#x27;s offspring, Cnebba Icel&#x27;s offspring, Icel Eomer&#x27;s offspring, Eomer Angeltheow&#x27;s offspring, Angeltheow Offa&#x27;s offspring, Offa Wermund&#x27;s offspring, Wermund Wihtlæg&#x27;s offspring, Wihtlæg Woden&#x27;s offspring.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; says that Pybba had 12 sons, including Penda, but that Penda and Eowa of Mercia were those best known to its author. (Many of these 12 sons of Pybba may merely represent later attempts to claim descent from him.) Besides Eowa, the pedigrees also give Penda a brother named Coenwalh from whom two later kings were said to descend, although this may instead represent his brother-in-law Cenwalh of Wessex.

The time at which Penda became king is uncertain, as are the circumstances. Another Mercian king, Cearl, is mentioned by Bede as ruling at the same time as the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith, in the early part of the 7th century. Whether Penda immediately succeeded Cearl is unknown, and it is also unclear whether they were related, and if so how closely; Henry of Huntingdon, writing in the 12th century, claimed that Cearl was a kinsman of Pybba. It is also possible that Cearl and Penda were dynastic rivals.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 years old at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not correspond to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 years old at the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda&#x27;s death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; actually meant to say that Penda was 50 years old at the time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.

Bede, in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;, says of Penda that he was &quot;a most warlike man of the royal race of the Mercians&quot; and that, following Edwin of Northumbria&#x27;s defeat in 633 (&quot;see&quot; below), he ruled the Mercians for 22 years with varying fortune. The noted 20th-century historian Frank Stenton was of the opinion that the language used by Bede &quot;leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin&#x27;s defeat&quot;. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; accords Penda a reign of only ten years, perhaps dating it from the time of the Battle of Maserfield (&quot;see&quot; below) around 642, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years. Given the apparent problems with the dates given by the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Historia&quot;, Bede&#x27;s account of the length of Penda&#x27;s reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. Nicholas Brooks noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda&#x27;s reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, Northumbrian, and Welsh), they may merely reflect the times at which their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda.

The question of whether or not Penda was already king during the late 620s assumes greater significance in light of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s record of a battle between Penda and the West Saxons under their kings Cynegils and Cwichelm taking place at Cirencester in 628. If he was not yet king, then his involvement in this conflict might indicate that he was fighting as an independent warlord during this period—as Stenton put it, &quot;a landless noble of the Mercian royal house fighting for his own hand.&quot; On the other hand, he might have been one of multiple rulers among the Mercians at the time, ruling only a part of their territory. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; says that after the battle, Penda and the West Saxons &quot;came to an agreement.&quot;

It has been speculated that this agreement marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the lower River Severn. These lands to the southwest of Mercia had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the Britons in 577, and the territory eventually became part of the subkingdom of the Hwicce. Given Penda&#x27;s role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, it has been argued that the subkingdom of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the subkingdom is known to have existed later in the century.

== Alliance with Cadwallon and the Battle of Hatfield Chase ==
In the late 620s or early 630s, Cadwallon ap Cadfan, the British (Welsh) king of Gwynedd, became involved in a war with Edwin of Northumbria, the most powerful king in Britain at the time. Cadwallon apparently was initially unsuccessful, but he joined with Penda, who is thought to have been the lesser partner in their alliance, to defeat the Northumbrians in October 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. Penda was probably not yet king of the Mercians, but he is thought to have become king soon afterwards, based on Bede&#x27;s characterisation of his position. Edwin was killed in the battle, and one of his sons, Eadfrith, fell into Penda&#x27;s hands.

One manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; says that following the victory at Hatfield Chase, Cadwallon and Penda went on to ravage &quot;the whole land&quot; of the Northumbrians. Certainly Cadwallon continued the war, but the extent of Penda&#x27;s further participation is uncertain. Bede says that the pagans who had slain Edwin—presumably a reference to the Mercians under Penda, although conceivably it could be a derisive misnomer meant to refer to the Christian British—burned a church and town at Campodonum, although the time at which this occurred is uncertain. Penda might have withdrawn from the war at some point before the defeat and death of Cadwallon at the Battle of Heavenfield, about a year after Hatfield Chase, since he was not present at this battle. Furthermore, Bede makes no mention of Penda&#x27;s presence in the preceding siege and battle in which Osric of Deira was defeated and killed. Penda&#x27;s successful participation in the battle of Hatfield Chase would have elevated his status among the Mercians and so enabled him to become king, and he might have withdrawn from the war before Heavenfield to secure or consolidate his position in Mercia. Referring to Penda&#x27;s successes against the West Saxons and the Northumbrians, D. P. Kirby writes of Penda&#x27;s emergence in these years as &quot;a Mercian leader whose military exploits far transcended those of his obscure predecessors.&quot;

== During the reign of Oswald ==
Oswald of Bernicia became king of Northumbria after his victory over Cadwallon at Heavenfield. Penda&#x27;s status and activities during the years of Oswald&#x27;s reign are obscure, and various interpretations of Penda&#x27;s position during this period have been suggested. It has been presumed that Penda acknowledged Oswald&#x27;s authority in some sense after Heavenfield, although Penda was probably an obstacle to Northumbrian supremacy south of the Humber. It has been suggested that Penda&#x27;s strength during Oswald&#x27;s reign could be exaggerated by the historical awareness of his later successes. Kirby says that, while Oswald was as powerful as Edwin had been, &quot;he faced a more entrenched challenge in midland and eastern England from Penda&quot;.

At some point during Oswald&#x27;s reign, Penda had Edwin&#x27;s son Eadfrith killed, &quot;contrary to his oath&quot;. The possibility that his killing was the result of pressure from Oswald—Eadfrith being a dynastic rival of Oswald—has been suggested. Since the potential existed for Eadfrith to be put to use in Mercia&#x27;s favour in Northumbrian power struggles while he was alive, it would not have been to Penda&#x27;s advantage to have him killed. On the other hand, Penda might have killed Eadfrith for his own reasons. It has been suggested that Penda was concerned that Eadfrith could be a threat to him because Eadfrith might seek vengeance for the deaths of his father and brother; it is also possible that Mercian dynastic rivalry played a part in the killing since Eadfrith was a grandson of Penda&#x27;s predecessor Cearl.

It was probably at some point during Oswald&#x27;s reign that Penda fought with the East Angles and defeated them, killing their king Egric and the former king Sigebert, who had been brought out of retirement in a monastery against his will in the belief that his presence would motivate the soldiers. The time at which the battle occurred is uncertain; it may have been as early as 635, but there is also evidence to suggest it could not have been before 640 or 641. Presuming that this battle took place before the Battle of Maserfield, it may have been that such an expression of Penda&#x27;s ambition and emerging power made Oswald feel that Penda had to be defeated for Northumbrian dominance of southern England to be secured or consolidated.

Penda&#x27;s brother Eowa was also said by the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; to have been a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The question of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and it is also possible that Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda&#x27;s death, his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.

Another possibility was suggested by Brooks: Penda might have lost power at some point after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians for at least some of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede&#x27;s statement implying that Penda&#x27;s fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda&#x27;s fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield.

== Maserfield ==
On 5 August 642, Penda defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Maserfield, which was fought near the lands of the Welsh, and Oswald was killed. Surviving Welsh poetry suggests that Penda fought in alliance with the men of Powys—apparently, he was consistently allied with some of the Welsh—perhaps including Cynddylan ap Cyndrwyn, of whom it was said that &quot;when the son of Pyb desired, how ready he was&quot;, presumably meaning that he was an ally of Penda, the son of Pybba. If the traditional identification of the battle&#x27;s location with Oswestry is correct, then this would indicate that it was Oswald who had taken the offensive against Penda. It has been suggested that he was acting against &quot;a threat posed to his domination of Mercia by a hostile alliance of Penda and Powys.&quot; According to Reginald of Durham&#x27;s 12th century &quot;Life of Saint Oswald&quot;, Penda fled into Wales before the battle, at which point Oswald felt secure and sent his army away. This explanation of events has been regarded as &quot;plausible&quot; but is not found in any other source, and may, therefore, have been Reginald&#x27;s invention.

According to Bede, Penda had Oswald&#x27;s body dismembered, with his head, hands, and arms being placed onto stakes (this may have had a pagan religious significance); Oswald thereafter came to be revered as a saint, with his death in battle as a Christian king against pagans leading him to be regarded as a martyr.

Eowa was killed at Maserfield along with Oswald, although on which side he fought is unknown. It may well be that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; regarded as the beginning of Penda&#x27;s ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; may also be referring to this battle when it says that Penda first freed (&quot;separavit&quot;) the Mercians from the Northumbrians. This may be an important clue to the relationship between the Mercians and the Northumbrians before and during Penda&#x27;s time. There may have existed a &quot;Humbrian confederacy&quot; that included the Mercians until Penda broke free of it. On the other hand, it has been considered unlikely that this was truly the first instance of their separation: it is significant that Cearl had married his daughter to Edwin during Edwin&#x27;s exile when Edwin was an enemy of the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith. It would seem that if Cearl was able to do this, he was not subject to Æthelfrith; thus it may be that any subject relationship only developed after the time of this marriage.

The battle left Penda with a degree of power unprecedented for a Mercian king—Kirby called him &quot;without question the most powerful Mercian ruler so far to have emerged in the midlands&quot; after Maserfield—and the prestige and status associated with defeating the powerful Oswald must have been very significant. Northumbria was greatly weakened as a consequence of the battle; the kingdom became fractured to some degree between Deira in its southern part and Bernicia in the north, with the Deirans acquiring a king of their own, Oswine, while in Bernicia, Oswald was succeeded by his brother, Oswiu. Mercia thus enjoyed a greatly enhanced position of strength relative to the surrounding kingdoms. Stenton wrote that the battle left Penda as &quot;the most formidable king in England&quot;, and observed that although &quot;there is no evidence that he ever became, or even tried to become, the lord of all the other kings of southern England ... none of them can have been his equal in reputation&quot;.

== Campaigns between Maserfield and the Winwaed ==
Defeat at Maserfield must have weakened Northumbrian influence over the West Saxons, and the new West Saxon king Cenwealh—who was still pagan at this time—was married to Penda&#x27;s sister. It may be surmised that this meant he was to some extent within what Kirby called a &quot;Mercian orbit&quot;. However, when Cenwealh (according to Bede) &quot;repudiated&quot; Penda&#x27;s sister in favour of another wife, Penda drove Cenwealh into exile in East Anglia in 645, where he remained for three years before regaining power. Who governed the West Saxons during the years of Cenwealh&#x27;s exile is unknown; Kirby considered it reasonable to conclude that whoever ruled was subject to Penda. He also suggested that Cenwealh may not have been able to return to his kingdom until after Penda&#x27;s death.

In 654, the East Anglian king Anna, who had harboured the exiled Cenwealh, was killed by Penda. He was succeeded by a brother, Æthelhere; since Æthelhere was subsequently a participant in Penda&#x27;s doomed invasion of Bernicia in 655 (&quot;see below&quot;), it may be that Penda installed Æthelhere in power. It has been suggested that Penda&#x27;s wars against the East Angles &quot;should be seen in the light of interfactional struggles within East Anglia.&quot; It may also be that Penda made war against the East Angles with the intention of securing Mercian dominance over the area of Middle Anglia, where Penda established his son Peada as ruler.

In the years after Maserfield, Penda also destructively waged war against Oswiu of Bernicia on his own territory. At one point before the death of Bishop Aidan (31 August 651), Bede says that Penda &quot;cruelly ravaged the country of the Northumbrians far and near&quot; and besieged the royal Bernician stronghold of Bamburgh. When the Mercians were unable to capture it—&quot;not being able to enter it by force, or by a long siege&quot;—Bede reports that they attempted to set the city ablaze, but that it was saved by a sacred wind supposedly sent in response to a plea from the saintly Aidan: &quot;Behold, Lord, how great mischief Penda does!&quot; The wind is said to have blown the fire back towards the Mercians, deterring them from further attempts to capture the city. At another point, some years after Aidan&#x27;s death, Bede records another attack. He says that Penda led an army in devastating the area where Aidan died—he &quot;destroyed all he could with fire and sword&quot;—but that when the Mercians burned down the church where Aidan died, the post against which he was leaning at the time of his death was undamaged; this was taken to be a miracle. No open battles are recorded as being fought between the two sides before the Winwaed in 655 (&quot;see&quot; below), however, and this may mean that Oswiu deliberately avoided battle due to a feeling of weakness relative to Penda. This feeling may have been in religious as well as military terms: N. J. Higham wrote of Penda acquiring &quot;a pre-eminent reputation as a god-protected, warrior–king&quot;, whose victories may have led to a belief that his pagan gods were more effective for protection in war than the Christian God.

== Relations with Bernicia; Christianity and Middle Anglia ==
Despite these apparent instances of warfare, relations between Penda and Oswiu were probably not entirely hostile during this period, since Penda&#x27;s daughter Cyneburh married Alhfrith, Oswiu&#x27;s son and Penda&#x27;s son Peada married Alhflaed, Oswiu&#x27;s daughter. According to Bede, who dates the events to 653, the latter marriage was made contingent upon the baptism and conversion to Christianity of Peada; Peada accepted this, and the preaching of Christianity began among the Middle Angles, whom he ruled. Bede wrote that Penda tolerated the preaching of Christianity in Mercia itself, despite his own beliefs:

Nor did King Penda obstruct the preaching of the word among his people, the Mercians, if any were willing to hear it; but, on the contrary, he hated and despised those whom he perceived not to perform the works of faith, when they had once received the faith, saying, &quot;They were contemptible and wretched who did not obey their God, in whom they believed.&quot; This was begun two years before the death of King Penda.

Peada&#x27;s conversion and the introduction of priests into Middle Anglia could be seen as evidence of Penda&#x27;s tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could be seen as corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu&#x27;s part to expand Bernician influence at Penda&#x27;s expense; Higham saw Peada&#x27;s conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.

Middle Anglia as a political entity may have been created by Penda as an expression of Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to have been a number of small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda&#x27;s establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia&#x27;s western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.

== Final campaign and the battle of the Winwaed ==
In 655, Penda invaded Bernicia with a large army, reported to have been 30 warbands, with 30 royal or noble commanders (&quot;duces regii&quot;, as Bede called them), including rulers such as Cadafael ap Cynfeddw of Gwynedd and Aethelhere of East Anglia. Penda also enjoyed the support of Aethelwald, the king of Deira and the successor of Oswine, who had been murdered on Oswiu&#x27;s orders in 651.

The cause of this war is uncertain. There is a passage in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; that suggests Aethelhere of East Anglia was the cause of the war. On the other hand, it has been argued that an issue of punctuation in later manuscripts confused Bede&#x27;s meaning on this point and that he in fact meant to refer to Penda as being responsible for the war. Although, according to Bede, Penda tolerated some Christian preaching in Mercia, it has been suggested that he perceived Bernician sponsorship of Christianity in Mercia and Middle Anglia as a form of &quot;religious colonialism&quot; that undermined his power, and that this may have provoked the war. Elsewhere the possibility has been suggested that Penda sought to prevent Oswiu from reunifying Northumbria, not wanting Oswiu to restore the kingdom to the power it had enjoyed under Edwin and Oswald. A perception of the conflict in terms of the political situation between Bernicia and Deira could help to explain the role of Aethelwald of Deira in the war, since Aethelwald was the son of Oswald and might not ordinarily be expected to ally with those who had killed his father. Perhaps, as the son of Oswald, he sought to obtain the Bernician kingship for himself.

According to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Penda besieged Oswiu at Iudeu; this site has been identified with Stirling, in the north of Oswiu&#x27;s kingdom. Oswiu tried to buy peace: in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, it is said that Oswiu offered treasure, which Penda distributed among his British allies. Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda, who &quot;resolved to extirpate all of [Oswiu&#x27;s] nation, from the highest to the lowest&quot;. Additionally, according to Bede, Oswiu&#x27;s son Ecgfrith was being held hostage &quot;at the court of Queen Cynwise, in the province of the Mercians&quot;—perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement. It would seem that Penda&#x27;s army then moved back south, perhaps returning home, but a great battle was fought near the river Winwaed in the region of Loidis, thought to be somewhere in the area around modern day Leeds, on a date given by Bede as 15 November. The identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain, but possibly it was a tributary of the Humber. There is good reason to believe it may well have been the river now known as Cock Beck in the ancient kingdom of Elmet. The Cock Beck meanders its way through Pendas Fields, close to an ancient well known as Pen Well on the outskirts of Leeds, before eventually joining the River Wharfe. This same Cock Beck whilst in flood also played a significant role in the much later Battle of Towton in 1461. Another possibility is the River Went (a tributary of the River Don, situated to the north of modern-day Doncaster). It may be that Penda&#x27;s army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability, which would help explain Oswiu&#x27;s victory over forces that were, according to Bede, much larger than his own.

The Mercian force was also weakened by desertions. According to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Cadafael of Gwynedd, &quot;rising up in the night, escaped together with his army&quot; (thus earning him the name &quot;Cadomedd&quot;, or &quot;battle-shirker&quot;), and Bede says that at the time of the battle, Aethelwald of Deira withdrew and &quot;awaited the outcome from a place of safety&quot;. According to Kirby, if Penda&#x27;s army was marching home, it may have been for this reason that some of his allies were unwilling to fight. It may also be that the allies had different purposes in the war, and Kirby suggested that Penda&#x27;s deserting allies may have been dissatisfied &quot;with what had been achieved at &quot;Iudeu&quot;&quot;. At a time when the Winwaed was swollen with heavy rains, the Mercians were badly defeated and Penda was killed, along with the East Anglian king Aethelhere. Bede says that Penda&#x27;s &quot;thirty commanders, and those who had come to his assistance were put to flight, and almost all of them slain,&quot; and that more drowned while fleeing than were killed in the actual battle. He also says that Penda&#x27;s head was cut off; a connection between this and the treatment of Oswald&#x27;s body at Maserfield is possible. Writing in the 12th century, Henry of Huntingdon emphasised the idea that Penda was suffering the same fate as he had inflicted on others.

== Aftermath and historical appraisal ==
With the defeat at the Winwaed, Oswiu came to briefly dominate Mercia, permitting Penda&#x27;s son Peada to rule its southern portion. Two of Penda&#x27;s other sons, Wulfhere and Æthelred, later ruled Mercia in succession after the overthrow of Northumbrian control in the late 650s. The period of rule by Penda&#x27;s descendants came to an end with his grandson Ceolred&#x27;s death in 716, after which power passed to descendants of Eowa for most of the remainder of the 8th century.

Penda&#x27;s reign is significant in that it marks an emergence from the obscurity of Mercia during the time of his predecessors, both in terms of the power of the Mercians relative to the surrounding peoples and in terms of our historical awareness of them. While our understanding of Penda&#x27;s reign is quite unclear, and even the very notable and decisive battles he fought are surrounded by historical confusion, for the first time a general outline of important events regarding the Mercians becomes realistically possible. Furthermore, Penda was certainly of great importance to the development of the Mercian kingdom; it has been said that his reign was &quot;crucial to the consolidation and expansion of Mercia&quot;.

It has been claimed that the hostility of Bede has obscured Penda&#x27;s importance as a ruler who wielded an &quot;imperium&quot; similar to that of other prominent 7th century &#x27;overkings&#x27;. Penda&#x27;s hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would have been based on personal as well as political ties, and they would often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda&#x27;s court would have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.

Penda was the last great pagan warrior-king among the Anglo-Saxons. Higham wrote that &quot;his destruction sounded the death-knell of English paganism as a political ideology and public religion.&quot; After Penda&#x27;s death, the Mercians were converted to Christianity, and all three of Penda&#x27;s reigning sons ruled as Christians. His daughters Cyneburh and Cyneswith became Christian and were saintly figures who according to some accounts retained their virginity through their marriages. There was purportedly even an infant grandson of Penda named Rumwold who lived a saintly three-day life of fervent preaching. What is known about Penda is primarily derived from the history written by the Northumbrian Bede, a priest not inclined to objectively portray a pagan Mercian who engaged in fierce conflict with Christian kings, and in particular with Northumbrian rulers. Indeed, Penda has been described as &quot;the villain of Bede&#x27;s third book&quot; (of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;). From the perspective of the Christians who later wrote about Penda, the important theme that dominates their descriptions is the religious context of his wars—for instance, the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; says that Penda prevailed at Maserfield through &quot;diabolical agency&quot;—but Penda&#x27;s greatest importance was perhaps in his opposition to the supremacy of the Northumbrians. According to Stenton, had it not been for Penda&#x27;s resistance, &quot;a loosely compacted kingdom of England under Northumbrian rule would probably have been established by the middle of the seventh century.&quot; In summarising Penda, he wrote the following:

He was himself a great fighting king of the kind most honoured in Germanic saga; the lord of many princes, and the leader of a vast retinue attracted to his service by his success and generosity. Many stories must have been told about his dealings with other kings, but none of them have survived; his wars can only be described from the standpoint of his enemies ...

== Issue ==
Penda&#x27;s wife is identified as Queen Cynewise or Kyneswitha. He had five sons and two daughters:

* Peada, succeeded his father in 654 as King of Mercia, married Ealhflæd, daughter of King Oswiu
* Wulfhere, King of Mercia 658–675; married Ermenilda of Ely;
* Æthelred, King of Mercia 675–704
* Merewalh, King of the Magonsæte; married a daughter of King Eormenred of Kent;
* Mercelmus, sometimes mistranscribed as Mercelinus;
* Cyneburh, married Alhfrith, King of Deira, son of King Oswiu;
* Cyneswith, became a nun.

== Portrayals ==
Penda appears in the historical novels &quot;King Penda&#x27;s Captain&quot; (1908) by MacKenzie MacBride, &quot;The Soul of a Serf&quot; (1910) by J. Breckenridge Ellis, and &quot;Better Than Gold&quot; (2014) by Theresa Tomlinson.

In the 1970s, Penda was depicted in two BBC television productions written by David Rudkin. He was played by Geoffrey Staines in &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot; (1974), and by Leo McKern in &quot;The Coming of the Cross&quot; (1975).

On account of the association of his death with Leeds, the Pendas Fields estate in Leeds was named after Penda.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Roma was a female deity who personified the city of Rome and, more broadly, the Roman state. She was created and promoted to represent and propagate certain of Rome&#x27;s ideas about itself, and to justify its rule. She was portrayed on coins, sculptures, architectural designs, and at official games and festivals. Images of Roma had elements in common with other goddesses, such as Rome&#x27;s Minerva, her Greek equivalent Athena and various manifestations of Greek Tyche, who protected Greek city-states; among these, Roma stands dominant, over piled weapons that represent her conquests, and promising protection to the obedient. Her &quot;Amazonian&quot; iconography shows her &quot;manly virtue&quot; (virtus) as fierce mother of a warrior race, augmenting rather than replacing local goddesses. On some coinage of the Roman Imperial era, she is shown as a serene advisor, partner and protector of ruling emperors. In Rome, the Emperor Hadrian built and dedicated a gigantic temple to her as &quot;Roma Aeterna&quot; (&quot;Eternal Rome&quot;), and to &quot;Venus Felix&quot; (&quot;Venus the Bringer of Good Fortune&quot;), emphasising the sacred, universal and eternal nature of the empire.

Roma&#x27;s official cult served to advance the propagandist message of Imperial Rome. In Roman art and coinage, she is usually depicted in military form, with helmet and weapons. In Rome&#x27;s eastern provinces, she was often shown with mural crown or cornucopia, or both. Her image is rarely found in a commonplace or domestic context. Roma was probably favoured by Rome&#x27;s high-status Imperial representatives abroad, rather than the Roman populace at large. She was depicted on silver cups, arches, and sculptures, including the base of the column of Antoninus Pius. She survived into the Christian period as a personification of the Roman state. Her depiction seated with a shield and spear later influenced that of Britannia, personification of Britain.

==Republican era==
===Identity and iconography===
A helmeted figure on Roman coins of 280–276 and 265–242 BC is sometimes interpreted as Roma but the identification is contestable. Other early Roman coinage shows a warlike &quot;Amazon&quot; type, possibly Roma but in Mellor&#x27;s opinion, more likely a than (goddess). During the late Second Punic War and the Pyrrhic War, Rome issued coins with a Phrygian helmeted head; some are stamped . In later coin issues, Roma wears varieties of the Attic helmet, the standard pattern for Roman army officers. In cases where clear coin legends are lacking, identification has been unresolved. Other female members of Rome&#x27;s official pantheon were also helmeted, including Bellona, and Minerva, the latter being equivalent to Greek Athena, who is believed by some scholars to be Roma&#x27;s original.

The earliest, more-or-less unequivocal coin identification of Roma is a silver stater of c. 275 BC issued by Rome&#x27;s ethnically Greek allies at Locri, on the Italian peninsula. It shows an enthroned woman with shield and other war-gear, clearly labelled as Roma. Another woman, labelled as Pistis (Greek equivalent to Roman Fides, or &quot;good faith&quot;), stands before Roma with a crown of leaves raised above her head. A Roman denarius of 114/115 shows Roma with Romulus, Remus and the she-Wolf, the mythological beast who fostered them, and nourished them with her milk; the coin image implies that Roma has protected and nourished Rome since its very foundation. Her &quot;Amazonian&quot; appearance recalls the fierce, barbaric, bare-breasted Amazons who fought in the Trojan War alongside the Trojans, supposed ancestors of the Romans. In the late Republican and early Imperial era, Roman literature presents Roma as one of the Roman people&#x27;s several &quot;Great Mothers&quot;, who included Venus and Cybele. Ennius personified the &quot;Roman fatherland&quot; as Roma: for Cicero, she was the &quot;Roman state&quot;, but neither of these are Roma. Though her Roman ancestry is possible – perhaps merely her name and the ideas it evoked, according to Mellor – she emerges as a Greek deity, whose essential iconography and character were already established in Italy, Magna Graecia and Rome.

===Earliest cults===
The earliest certain cult to Roma was established at Smyrna in 195 BC, probably to mark Rome&#x27;s successful alliance against Antiochus III. Mellor has proposed her cult as a form of religio-political diplomacy which adjusted traditional Graeco-Eastern divine monarchic honours to Republican mores: divine honours to the divine personification of the Roman state acknowledged the authority of its offices, Republic and city, but did not displace local, Greek cult to individual Roman benefactors.

Democratic city-states such as Athens and Rhodes accepted Roma as analogous to their traditional cult personifications of the (ordinary people). In 189 BC, Delphi and Lycia instituted festivals in her honour. Roma as &quot;divine sponsor&quot; of athletics and pan-Hellenic culture seems to have dovetailed neatly into a well-established and enthusiastic festival circuit, and temples to her were outnumbered by her civic statues and dedications. In 133 BC, Attalus III bequeathed the people and territories of Pergamon to Rome, as to a trusted ally and protector. The Pergamene bequest became the new Roman province of Asia, and Roma&#x27;s cult spread rapidly within it.

In contrast to her putative &quot;Amazonian&quot; Roman original, Greek coinage reduces the ferocity of her image, and depicts her in the &quot;dignified and rather severe style&quot; of a Greek goddess, often wearing a mural crown, or sometimes a Phrygian helmet. She is occasionally bareheaded. In this and later periods, she was often associated with Zeus (as guardian of oaths) and Fides (the personification of mutual trust). Her Eastern cult appealed for Rome&#x27;s alliance and protection. A panegyric to her survives, in five Sapphic stanzas attributed to the Greek poet Melinno, who claims that she is the daughter of Ares and celebrates her fierce commitment to her offspring and proteges.

 Hail, Roma, daughter of Ares, golden-belted warlike queen, you whose earthly home is Olympus the eternally unshattered. Ancient Fate gave to you alone the unbroken glory of royal command, so that the strength to rule is in your hands. Under your strong-strapped yoke the chests of the earth and the gray sea are harnessed. You safely steer the cities of the people. And though mighty time strikes down all things and reshapes life into many different forms, for you alone the wind that blows to the uttermost ends of power does not shift. For indeed you bear the strongest great warriors of all, just like the bountiful crop yielded by Demeter&#x27;s fields.

At this time, her cult in Republican Rome and its Eastern was virtually non-existent. In her &quot;Amazonian&quot; type, her usually single bare breast signifies the same boldness and fiercely maternal, nurturing virtues. In Hellenistic religious tradition, gods were served by priests and goddesses by priestesses but Roma&#x27;s priesthood was male, perhaps in acknowledgment of the virility of Rome&#x27;s military power. Priesthood of the Roma cult was competed among the highest ranking local elites.

==Imperial era==

The assassination of Julius Caesar led to his apotheosis and cult as a State in Rome and her Eastern colonies. Caesar&#x27;s adopted heir Augustus ended Rome&#x27;s civil war and became princeps (&quot;leading man&quot;) of the Republic, and in 30/29 BC, the of Asia and Bithynia requested permission to honour him as a living . Republican values held monarchy in contempt, and despised Hellenic honours – Caesar had fatally courted both – but an outright refusal might offend loyal provincials and allies. A cautious formula was drawn up: non-Romans could only offer him cult as jointly with Roma. Roma had an Imperial role as consort to the emperor and mother of the entire Roman people. In Greek city-states her iconography would have merged with that of the local Tyche; this usually included a mural crown and cornucopia. Roma&#x27;s seated pose, seen in more than half the known depictions, was also used for Athena, the Hellenic equivalent of Roman Minerva. Like Athena, Roma represents &quot;manly&quot; female virtues, a personification of an empire built on conquest. From here on, Roma increasingly took the attributes of an Imperial or divine consort to the Imperial , but some Greek coin types show her as a seated or enthroned authority, and the Imperial standing upright as if her supplicant or servant.

In the western part of the Empire, the foundation of the Imperial cult centre at Lugdunum introduced Roman models for provincial and municipal assemblies and government, a Romanised lifestyle, and an opportunity for local elites to enjoy the advantages of Roman citizenship through election to Imperial cult priesthood. Its (altar) was dedicated to Roma and Augustus. Thereafter, Roma&#x27;s presence is well attested by inscriptions and coinage throughout the Western provinces. Literary sources have little to say about her, but this may reflect her ubiquity rather than neglect: in the early Augustan era, as in Greece, she may have been honoured above her living Imperial consort.

In provincial Africa, one temple to Roma and Augustus is known at Leptis Magna and another at Mactar. On the Italian peninsula, six have been proven – Latium built two, one of them privately funded. During the reign of Tiberius, Ostia built a grand municipal temple to Roma and Augustus.

In the city of Rome itself, the earliest known state cult to Roma was combined with cult to Venus at the Hadrianic Temple of Venus and Roma. This was the largest temple in the city, probably dedicated to inaugurate the reformed festival of , which was known thereafter as the after the Eastern festival in Roma&#x27;s honour. The temple contained the seated, fully draped, Hellenised and highly influential image of Roma – the Palladium in her right hand symbolised Rome&#x27;s eternity. In Rome, this was a novel realisation. Greek interpretations of Roma as a dignified deity had transformed her from a symbol of military dominance to one of Imperial protection and .
Following the defeat of Clodius Albinus and his allies by Septimius Severus at Lugdunum, Roma was removed from the Lugdunum cult to the temple, where along with the Augusti she was co-opted into a new formulation of Imperial cult. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites at Lugdunum as those offered any by his slaves. It is not known how long this phase lasted, but it appears to have been a unique development.
In a later, even more turbulent era, a common coin type of Probus shows him in the radiate solar crown of the Dominate: the reverse offers Rome&#x27;s Temple of Venus and dea Roma. While Probus&#x27; image shows his monarchic Imperium, Roma displays his claims to restoration of Roman tradition and Imperial unity.

== In arts, craft and literature of the Imperial era ==

Lucan&#x27;s poem, &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, depicts Roma as a strong woman who represents Roman values. The poem follows the civil war between Julius Caesar and the forces of the Roman Senate, led by Pompey the Great. Caesar, having repudiated Roma and her values, ends up with a mistress in Egypt (Cleopatra), having set his own destiny on a path to eventual self-destruction. The poet identifies Roma (the ) with the idealised Roman matrona. A man who rejects either one cannot be truly Roman.

Roma is represented as a major character on the silver Boscoreale cup. She stands helmeted, prepared for war, vigilant but at peace. Her foot rests on a &quot;weapon pile&quot;; trophies of past conflict. She converses with a young, standing male usually identified as the genius of the Roman people, who appears to be waiting to speak with the seated emperor (probably Augustus). In the Gemma Augustea sculpture by Dioscurides, Roma sits beside Augustus in military apparel.

On the Arch of Titus (1st-century CE), the arch of Septimius Severus and the arch of Constantine, Roma accompanies the emperor in his chariot, as his escort.

Figures of Roma are rare in a domestic context, throughout the Empire, and in the provinces they may have been associated with Roman residents. In Corinth, a statuette of Roma was found, along with those of other deities, in a domestic shrine in the Panayia Domus, tentatively dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD. The deities were smaller than life but all were well-crafted and most had traces of gilding: the Roma figure sits on a backless chair, and wears a triple-crested war-helmet and a peplum. She has one breast exposed and wears shin-high openwork boots, based on a &quot;draped Amazon&quot;, warlike type. Sterling speculates an official connection between the owners of this Roma figure and the nearby Corinthian Temple 1.

==In the Book of Revelation==
In the Book of Revelation, the letter to the church in Pergamum (2:12–17) warns against Christian involvement in eating food sacrificed to idols, potentially a reference to the Roman imperial cult which was popular in Pergamum in the era and worshipped the deified Augustus and the goddess Roma. Later, the book introduces a villainous character called the Whore of Babylon, generally considered a reference to Rome, the dominant power of the era, and potentially an outright caricature of Roma:
Additionally, the Whore of Babylon is described as riding a beast with seven heads, and the book says that &quot;the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated,&quot; typically understood as the seven hills of Rome. An image of Dea Roma on a sestertius of Emperor Vespasian shows her reclining on Rome&#x27;s seven hills with various accoutrements; in this interpretation, the readers of the Book of Revelation, familiar with the iconography of Roman coins, would understand who was being referred to. Rather than Roma&#x27;s depiction as an elegant and regal woman bedecked in jewels and taming a wild animal in conquest in Roman art, the author of Revelation sees Roma as a corrupt and evil force &quot;drunk with blood.&quot;

While most scholars recognize that Babylon is a cipher for Rome, they also say that Babylon represents more than just the Roman city of the first century. Craig Koester writes that &quot;the whore is Rome, yet more than Rome&quot;. It &quot;is the Roman imperial world, which in turn represents the world alienated from God&quot;.

==Modern times==
The Altar of the Fatherland is the most famous part of the Altare della Patria in Rome and is the one with which it is often identified. On the top of the entrance stairway, it was designed by the Brescian sculptor Angelo Zanelli, who won a competition specially held in 1906. It is formed from the side of the Tomb of Italian Unknown Soldier that faces the outside of the building (the other side, which faces inside the Vittoriano, is in a crypt), from the &quot;sacellum&quot; of the statue of Roma (which is exactly above the tomb of the Unknown Soldier) and two vertical marble reliefs that descend from the edges of the aedicula containing the statue of the goddess Rome and which run downwards laterally to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

The statue of Roma present at the Vittoriano interrupted a custom in vogue until the 19th century, by which the representation of this subject was with exclusively warlike traits. Angelo Zanelli, in his work, decided to further characterize the statue by also providing the reference to Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and the arts, as well as of war. The great statue of the deity emerges from a golden background. The presence of the goddess Roma in the Vittoriano underlines the irremissible will of the Unification of Italy patriots to have the Rome as the capital of Italy, an essential concept, according to the common feeling, from the history of the peninsula and the islands of Italian culture.

==Legacy==
Ronald Mellor wrote in the introduction to his work on Roma, summing up her influence, that &quot;As personification, as goddess or as symbol, the name &quot;Roma&quot; stretches from classical Greece to Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist propaganda ... &quot;Roma&quot; has been seen as a goddess, a whore, a near-saint, and as the symbol of civilization itself. She remains the oldest continuous political-religious symbol in Western civilization.&quot;

<text>In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding behavior to existing code (an advice) &quot;without&quot; modifying the code, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a &quot;pointcut&quot; specification, such as &quot;log all function calls when the function&#x27;s name begins with &#x27;set. This allows behaviors that are not central to the business logic (such as logging) to be added to a program without cluttering the code of core functions.

AOP includes programming methods and tools that support the modularization of concerns at the level of the source code, while aspect-oriented software development refers to a whole engineering discipline.

Aspect-oriented programming entails breaking down program logic into cohesive areas of functionality (so-called &quot;concerns&quot;). Nearly all programming paradigms support some level of grouping and encapsulation of concerns into separate, independent entities by providing abstractions (e.g., functions, procedures, modules, classes, methods) that can be used for implementing, abstracting, and composing these concerns. Some concerns &quot;cut across&quot; multiple abstractions in a program, and defy these forms of implementation. These concerns are called &quot;cross-cutting concerns&quot; or horizontal concerns.

Logging exemplifies a cross-cutting concern because a logging strategy must affect every logged part of the system. Logging thereby &quot;crosscuts&quot; all logged classes and methods.

All AOP implementations have some cross-cutting expressions that encapsulate each concern in one place. The difference between implementations lies in the power, safety, and usability of the constructs provided. For example, interceptors that specify the methods to express a limited form of cross-cutting, without much support for type-safety or debugging. AspectJ has a number of such expressions and encapsulates them in a special class, called an aspect. For example, an aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the non-aspect part of a program) by applying advice (additional behavior) at various join points (points in a program) specified in a quantification or query called a pointcut (that detects whether a given join point matches). An aspect can also make binary-compatible structural changes to other classes, such as adding members or parents.

==History==
AOP has several direct antecedents A1 and A2: reflection and metaobject protocols, subject-oriented programming, Composition Filters, and Adaptive Programming.

Gregor Kiczales and colleagues at Xerox PARC developed the explicit concept of AOP and followed this with the AspectJ AOP extension to Java. IBM&#x27;s research team pursued a tool approach over a language design approach and in 2001 proposed Hyper/J and the Concern Manipulation Environment, which have not seen wide use.

The examples in this article use AspectJ.

The Microsoft Transaction Server is considered to be the first major application of AOP followed by Enterprise JavaBeans.

== Motivation and basic concepts ==
Typically, an aspect is &quot;scattered&quot; or &quot;tangled&quot; as code, making it harder to understand and maintain. It is scattered by the function (such as logging) being spread over a number of unrelated functions that might use &quot;its&quot; function, possibly in entirely unrelated systems or written in different languages. Thus, changing logging can require modifying all affected modules. Aspects become tangled not only with the mainline function of the systems in which they are expressed but also with each other. Changing one concern thus entails understanding all the tangled concerns or having some means by which the effect of changes can be inferred.

For example, consider a banking application with a conceptually very simple method for transferring an amount from one account to another:

void transfer(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, int amount) throws Exception {
 if (fromAcc.getBalance() &lt; amount)
 throw new InsufficientFundsException();

 fromAcc.withdraw(amount);
 toAcc.deposit(amount);


However, this transfer method overlooks certain considerations that a deployed application would require, such as verifying that the current user is authorized to perform this operation, encapsulating database transactions to prevent accidental data loss, and logging the operation for diagnostic purposes.

A version with all those new concerns might look like this:
void transfer(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, int amount, User user,
 Logger logger, Database database) throws Exception {
 logger.info(&quot;Transferring money...&quot;);
 if (!isUserAuthorised(user, fromAcc)) {
 logger.info(&quot;User has no permission.&quot;);
 throw new UnauthorisedUserException();
 
 if (fromAcc.getBalance() &lt; amount) {
 logger.info(&quot;Insufficient funds.&quot;);
 throw new InsufficientFundsException();

 fromAcc.withdraw(amount);
 toAcc.deposit(amount);

 database.commitChanges(); // Atomic operation.

 logger.info(&quot;Transaction successful.&quot;);


In this example, other interests have become &quot;tangled&quot; with the basic functionality (sometimes called the &quot;business logic concern&quot;). Transactions, security, and logging all exemplify &quot;cross-cutting concerns&quot;.

Now consider what would happen if we suddenly need to change the security considerations for the application. In the program&#x27;s current version, security-related operations appear &quot;scattered&quot; across numerous methods, and such a change would require major effort.

AOP tries to solve this problem by allowing the programmer to express cross-cutting concerns in stand-alone modules called &quot;aspects&quot;. Aspects can contain &quot;advice&quot; (code joined to specified points in the program) and &quot;inter-type declarations&quot; (structural members added to other classes). For example, a security module can include advice that performs a security check before accessing a bank account. The pointcut defines the times (join points) when one can access a bank account, and the code in the advice body defines how the security check is implemented. That way, both the check and the places can be maintained in one place. Further, a good pointcut can anticipate later program changes, so if another developer creates a new method to access the bank account, the advice will apply to the new method when it executes.

So for the example above implementing logging in an aspect:
aspect Logger {
 void Bank.transfer(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, int amount, User user, Logger logger) {
 logger.info(&quot;Transferring money...&quot;);

 void Bank.getMoneyBack(User user, int transactionId, Logger logger) {
 logger.info(&quot;User requested money back.&quot;);

 // Other crosscutting code.


One can think of AOP as a debugging tool or a user-level tool. Advice should be reserved for cases in which one cannot get the function changed (user level) or do not want to change the function in production code (debugging).

==Join point models==
The advice-related component of an aspect-oriented language defines a join point model (JPM). A JPM defines three things:

# When the advice can run. These are called &quot;join points&quot; because they are points in a running program where additional behavior can be usefully joined. A join point needs to be addressable and understandable by an ordinary programmer to be useful. It should also be stable across inconsequential program changes to maintain aspect stability. Many AOP implementations support method executions and field references as join points.
# A way to specify (or &quot;quantify&quot;) join points, called &quot;pointcuts&quot;. Pointcuts determine whether a given join point matches. Most useful pointcut languages use a syntax like the base language (for example, AspectJ uses Java signatures) and allow reuse through naming and combination.
# A means of specifying code to run at a join point. AspectJ calls this &quot;advice&quot;, and can run it before, after, and around join points. Some implementations also support defining a method in an aspect on another class.

Join-point models can be compared based on the join points exposed, how join points are specified, the operations permitted at the join points, and the structural enhancements that can be expressed.

===AspectJ&#x27;s join-point model===

===Other potential join point models===
There are other kinds of JPMs. All advice languages can be defined in terms of their JPM. For example, a hypothetical aspect language for UML may have the following JPM:

* Join points are all model elements.
* Pointcuts are some Boolean expression combining the model elements.
* The means of affect at these points are a visualization of all the matched join points.

===Inter-type declarations===
&quot;Inter-type declarations&quot; provide a way to express cross-cutting concerns affecting the structure of modules. Also known as &quot;open classes&quot; and &quot;extension methods&quot;, this enables programmers to declare in one place members or parents of another class, typically to combine all the code related to a concern in one aspect. For example, if a programmer implemented the cross-cutting display-update concern using visitors, an inter-type declaration using the visitor pattern might look like this in AspectJ:
 aspect DisplayUpdate {
 void Point.acceptVisitor(Visitor v) {
 v.visit(this);
 // other crosscutting code...


This code snippet adds the codice_1 method to the codice_2 class.

Any structural additions are required to be compatible with the original class, so that clients of the existing class continue to operate, unless the AOP implementation can expect to control all clients at all times.

==Implementation==
AOP programs can affect other programs in two different ways, depending on the underlying languages and environments:

# a combined program is produced, valid in the original language and indistinguishable from an ordinary program to the ultimate interpreter
# the ultimate interpreter or environment is updated to understand and implement AOP features.

The difficulty of changing environments means most implementations produce compatible combination programs through a type of program transformation known as &quot;weaving&quot;. An aspect weaver reads the aspect-oriented code and generates appropriate object-oriented code with the aspects integrated. The same AOP language can be implemented through a variety of weaving methods, so the semantics of a language should never be understood in terms of the weaving implementation. Only the speed of an implementation and its ease of deployment are affected by the method of combination used.

Systems can implement source-level weaving using preprocessors (as C++ was implemented originally in CFront) that require access to program source files. However, Java&#x27;s well-defined binary form enables bytecode weavers to work with any Java program in .class-file form. Bytecode weavers can be deployed during the build process or, if the weave model is per-class, during class loading. AspectJ started with source-level weaving in 2001, delivered a per-class bytecode weaver in 2002, and offered advanced load-time support after the integration of AspectWerkz in 2005.

Any solution that combines programs at runtime must provide views that segregate them properly to maintain the programmer&#x27;s segregated model. Java&#x27;s bytecode support for multiple source files enables any debugger to step through a properly woven .class file in a source editor. However, some third-party decompilers cannot process woven code because they expect code produced by Javac rather than all supported bytecode forms (see also § Criticism, below).

Deploy-time weaving offers another approach. This basically implies post-processing, but rather than patching the generated code, this weaving approach &quot;subclasses&quot; existing classes so that the modifications are introduced by method-overriding. The existing classes remain untouched, even at runtime, and all existing tools, such as debuggers and profilers, can be used during development. A similar approach has already proven itself in the implementation of many Java EE application servers, such as IBM&#x27;s WebSphere.

===Terminology===

Standard terminology used in Aspect-oriented programming may include:

;Cross-cutting concerns: Even though most classes in an object-oriented model will perform a single, specific function, they often share common, secondary requirements with other classes. For example, we may want to add logging to classes within the data-access layer and also to classes in the UI layer whenever a thread enters or exits a method. Further concerns can be related to security such as access control or information flow control. Even though each class has a very different primary functionality, the code needed to perform the secondary functionality is often identical.
;Advice: This is the additional code that you want to apply to your existing model. In our example, this is the logging code that we want to apply whenever the thread enters or exits a method.:
;Pointcut: This refers to the point of execution in the application at which cross-cutting concern needs to be applied. In our example, a pointcut is reached when the thread enters a method, and another pointcut is reached when the thread exits the method.
;Aspect: The combination of the pointcut and the advice is termed an aspect. In the example above, we add a logging aspect to our application by defining a pointcut and giving the correct advice.

== Comparison to other programming paradigms ==
Aspects emerged from object-oriented programming and reflective programming. AOP languages have functionality similar to, but more restricted than, metaobject protocols. Aspects relate closely to programming concepts like subjects, mixins, and delegation. Other ways to use aspect-oriented programming paradigms include Composition Filters and the hyperslices approach. Since at least the 1970s, developers have been using forms of interception and dispatch-patching that resemble some of the implementation methods for AOP, but these never had the semantics that the cross-cutting specifications provide in one place. 

Designers have considered alternative ways to achieve separation of code, such as C#&#x27;s partial types, but such approaches lack a quantification mechanism that allows reaching several join points of the code with one declarative statement.

Though it may seem unrelated, in testing, the use of mocks or stubs requires the use of AOP techniques, such as around advice. Here the collaborating objects are for the purpose of the test, a cross-cutting concern. Thus, the various Mock Object frameworks provide these features. For example, a process invokes a service to get a balance amount. In the test of the process, it is unimportant where the amount comes from, but only that the process uses the balance according to the requirements.

== Adoption issues ==

Programmers need to be able to read and understand code to prevent errors.
Even with proper education, understanding cross-cutting concerns can be difficult without proper support for visualizing both static structure and the dynamic flow of a program. Starting in 2002, AspectJ began to provide IDE plug-ins to support the visualizing of cross-cutting concerns. Those features, as well as aspect code assist and refactoring, are now common.

Given the power of AOP, making a logical mistake in expressing cross-cutting can lead to widespread program failure. Conversely, another programmer may change the join points in a program, such as by renaming or moving methods, in ways that the aspect writer did not anticipate and with unforeseen consequences. One advantage of modularizing cross-cutting concerns is enabling one programmer to easily affect the entire system. As a result, such problems manifest as a conflict over responsibility between two or more developers for a given failure. AOP can expedite solving these problems, as only the aspect must be changed. Without AOP, the corresponding problems can be much more spread out.

==Criticism==
The most basic criticism of the effect of AOP is that control flow is obscured, and that it is not only worse than the much-maligned GOTO statement, but is closely analogous to the joke COME FROM statement. The &quot;obliviousness of application&quot;, which is fundamental to many definitions of AOP (the code in question has no indication that an advice will be applied, which is specified instead in the pointcut), means that the advice is not visible, in contrast to an explicit method call. For example, compare the COME FROM program:

 5 INPUT X
10 PRINT &#x27;Result is :&#x27;
15 PRINT X
20 COME FROM 10
25 X = X * X
30 RETURN

with an AOP fragment with analogous semantics:

main() {
 input x
 print(result(x))
input result(int x) { return x }
around(int x): call(result(int)) &amp;&amp; args(x) {
 int temp = proceed(x)
 return temp * temp

Indeed, the pointcut may depend on runtime condition and thus not be statically deterministic. This can be mitigated but not solved by static analysis and IDE support showing which advices &quot;potentially&quot; match.

General criticisms are that AOP purports to improve &quot;both modularity and the structure of code&quot;, but some counter that it instead undermines these goals and impedes &quot;independent development and understandability of programs&quot;. Specifically, quantification by pointcuts breaks modularity: &quot;one must, in general, have whole-program knowledge to reason about the dynamic execution of an aspect-oriented program.&quot; Further, while its goals (modularizing cross-cutting concerns) are well understood, its actual definition is unclear and not clearly distinguished from other well-established techniques. Cross-cutting concerns potentially cross-cut each other, requiring some resolution mechanism, such as ordering. Indeed, aspects can apply to themselves, leading to problems such as the liar paradox.

Technical criticisms include that the quantification of pointcuts (defining where advices are executed) is &quot;extremely sensitive to changes in the program&quot;, which is known as the &quot;fragile pointcut problem&quot;. The problems with pointcuts are deemed intractable. If one replaces the quantification of pointcuts with explicit annotations, one obtains attribute-oriented programming instead, which is simply an explicit subroutine call and suffers the identical problem of scattering, which AOP was designed to solve.

<text>Jane Bathori (14 June 1877 – 25 January 1970) was a French mezzo-soprano. She was famous on the operatic stage and important in the development of contemporary French music.

== Life and career ==
Born Jeanne-Marie Berthier, she originally studied piano and planned a career as concert pianist but soon turned to singing, making her professional debut some time in 1898 at the small &quot;Théâtre de la Bodinière&quot; in the Rue Saint-Lazare in a concert to celebrate the poet Paul Verlaine. In the same year she made her debut in the &quot;grands concerts&quot; at the &quot;Concerts du Conservatoire&quot; followed by performances in Fauré&#x27;s &quot;La Naissance de Vénus&quot; and Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Messe de Requiem&quot;. During the season 1899–1900 she made her operatic debut at Nantes. Her first roles included soprano parts such as Mimi in &quot;La bohème&quot; and Micaëla in &quot;Carmen&quot;.

In the early 1900s Bathori began studying with Pierre-Émile Engel, whom she married in 1908. She became celebrated for her performance of Ravel&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Shéhérazade&quot; and gave the premières of his &quot;Histoires naturelles&quot; (of which she was the dedicatee) and of his &quot;Chansons madécasses&quot;. In 1917 Bathori became the director of the &quot;Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier&quot;.

In the early 1920s she played an important role in the propagation of new music of this period, especially by some of the members of Les Six, giving many first performances of their works and those of others.

Throughout the 1930s Bathori appeared every year at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. In 1935 she was appointed to the Legion of Honour for her services to French music. During the German occupation of France in the Second World War she made Buenos Aires her home. After her return to France she taught singing, and gave frequent talks for French radio.

Bathori died in Paris in 1970, aged 92.

<doc id="145331" wikidata="Q2483353" url="?curid=145331" title="Stephen of Ripon">
<text>Stephen of Ripon was the author of the eighth-century hagiographic text &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; (&quot;Life of Saint Wilfrid&quot;). Other names once traditionally attributed to him are Eddius Stephanus or Æddi Stephanus, but these names are no longer preferred or accepted by historians today; modern usage tends to favour &quot;Stephen&quot;.

==Life==

Very little is known about the life of Stephen of Ripon. The author of &quot;The life of Saint Wilfrid&quot; identifies himself as &quot;Stephen, a priest&quot;. Bede mentions that Wilfrid brought a singing master from Kent, &quot;Ædde Stephanus&quot;, to Ripon in 669 to teach chant, and traditionally he is thought to be the same person as the &quot;Stephen&quot; mentioned in the text. The written evidence suggest there are two candidates for the same person. If the two were the same, Stephen would have been at least twenty years old when he came north, placing him in his sixties or older at Wilfrid&#x27;s death in 709. He was then recorded as being present at the anniversary of Wilfrid&#x27;s death a year later. Thus the question of Stephen&#x27;s age has made some historians wonder whether Stephen was in Wilfrid&#x27;s entourage at all but were part of a later generation. The biographer Stephen had Ripon as his religious home and would have been able to consult all the individuals who knew Wilfrid as source material for &quot;The life of Saint Wilfrid&quot;.

==Writings==

===&quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;===

Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; is the only documentary source on Saint Wilfrid, aside from Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;. It was written shortly after Wilfrid&#x27;s death in 709. Stephen was asked to write the &quot;Vita&quot; by Acca of Hexham, one of Wilfrid&#x27;s followers, who later became a bishop and succeeded Wilfrid in the See of Hexham. Although Stephen likely knew Wilfrid and had access to others who knew him, he recounts several extraordinary events and makes use of available text sources. He copies two lines directly from &quot;Vita Sancti Cuthberti&quot;, otherwise known as the Anonymous Life of Saint Cuthbert. However, unlike many early medieval hagiographies which consisted of strings of miracles attributed to saints, Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; takes the form of a chronological narrative and includes specific names and events.

It is unknown what Stephen hoped to accomplish in writing the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;, but scholars have several theories. It has been argued that Stephen&#x27;s use of lines from &quot;Vita Sancti Cuthberti&quot; was a way of outdoing the cult based around Cuthbert and replacing him with Wilfrid. However, Stephen&#x27;s borrowings make up only a tiny percentage of the whole and are entirely located in the early part of the work, making this theory seem unlikely.

The work is biased in favour of Wilfrid and includes explicit comparisons of Wilfrid to Old Testament figures and to the Apostle Paul. Early on, Stephen explains that the community urged him to write the &quot;Vita&quot;. Stephen&#x27;s goal in writing could simply have been to describe the community&#x27;s feelings on the holiness and goodness of the life of Wilfrid, whom they had known personally.

==Significance==
Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; was one of the first Anglo-Saxon histories, and the earliest to survive. Bede used it as a source for sections of his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, although he did not acknowledge it.

The &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; is also significant in that it provides a contemporary perspective on events that transpired during Wilfrid&#x27;s lifetime. For instance, it gives an account of the Synod of Whitby that differs from Bede&#x27;s. While Stephen&#x27;s writing has come under more criticism than Bede&#x27;s, the account found in the &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; reveals political factors that may have affected the Synod alongside the religious controversies described by Bede.

*&quot;Eddi&#x27;s Service&quot;
*&quot;The Conversion of St Wilfrid&quot;

<text>Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa ( , , ; born José Doroteo Arango Arámbula; 5 June 1878 – 20 July 1923) was a Mexican revolutionary and prominent figure in the Mexican Revolution. He was a key figure in the revolutionary movement that forced out President Porfirio Díaz and brought Francisco I. Madero to power in 1911. When Madero was ousted by a coup led by General Victoriano Huerta in February 1913, Villa joined the anti-Huerta forces in the Constitutionalist Army led by Venustiano Carranza. After the defeat and exile of Huerta in July 1914, Villa broke with Carranza. Villa dominated the meeting of revolutionary generals that excluded Carranza and helped create a coalition government. Emiliano Zapata and Villa became formal allies in this period. Like Zapata, Villa was strongly in favor of land reform, but did not implement it when he had power. 

At the height of his power and popularity in late 1914 and early 1915, the U.S. considered recognizing Villa as Mexico&#x27;s legitimate president. In Mexico, Villa is generally regarded as a hero of the Mexican Revolution who dared to stand up to the United States. Some American media outlets describe Villa as a villain and a murderer.

In November 1915, civil war broke out when Carranza challenged Villa. Villa was decisively defeated by Constitutionalist general Álvaro Obregón in summer 1915, and the U.S. aided Carranza directly against Villa in the Second Battle of Agua Prieta. Much of Villa&#x27;s army left after his defeat on the battlefield and because of his lack of resources to buy arms and pay soldiers&#x27; salaries. Angered at U.S. support for Carranza, Villa conducted a raid on the border town of Columbus, New Mexico to goad the U.S. into invading Mexico in 1916. Despite a major contingent of soldiers and superior military technology, the U.S. failed to capture Villa. When Carranza was ousted from power in 1920, Villa negotiated an amnesty with interim President Adolfo de la Huerta and was given a landed estate, on the condition he retire from politics. Villa was assassinated in 1923. Although his faction did not prevail in the Revolution, he was one of its most charismatic and prominent figures.

In life, Villa helped fashion his own image as an internationally known revolutionary hero, starring as himself in Hollywood films and giving interviews to foreign journalists, most notably John Reed. After his death he was excluded from the pantheon of revolutionary heroes until the Sonoran generals Obregón and Calles, whom he battled during the Revolution, were gone from the political stage. Villa&#x27;s exclusion from the official narrative of the Revolution might have contributed to his continued posthumous popular acclaim. He was celebrated during the Revolution and long afterward by &quot;corridos&quot;, films about his life and novels by prominent writers. In 1976, his remains were reburied in the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City in a huge public ceremony.

==Early life==

Villa told a number of conflicting stories about his early life. According to most sources, he was born on 5 June 1878, and named José Doroteo Arango Arámbula at birth. As a child, he received some education from a local church-run school, but was not proficient in more than basic literacy. His father was a sharecropper named Agustín Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arámbula. He grew up at the &quot;Rancho de la Coyotada&quot;, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. The family&#x27;s residence now houses the Casa de Pancho Villa historic museum in San Juan del Rio. Doroteo later claimed to be the son of the bandit Agustín Villa, but according to at least one scholar, &quot;the identity of his real father is still unknown.&quot; He was the oldest of five children. He quit school to help his mother after his father died, and worked as a sharecropper, muleskinner (&quot;arriero&quot;), butcher, bricklayer, and foreman for a U.S. railway company.
According to his dictated remembrances, published as &quot;Memorias de Pancho Villa,&quot; at the age of 16 he moved to Chihuahua, but soon returned to Durango to track down and kill an hacienda owner named Agustín López Negrete who had raped his sister, afterward stealing a horse and fleeing to the Sierra Madre Occidental region of Durango, where he roamed the hills as a thief. Eventually, he became a member of a bandit band where he went by the name &quot;Arango&quot;.
In 1898 he was arrested for gun and mule theft.

In 1902, the rurales, the crack rural police force of President Porfirio Díaz, arrested Pancho for stealing mules and for assault. Because of his connections with the powerful Pablo Valenzuela, who allegedly had been a recipient of goods stolen by Villa/Arango, he was spared the death sentence sometimes imposed on captured bandits. Pancho Villa was forcibly inducted into the Federal Army, a practice often adopted under the Diaz regime to deal with troublemakers. Several months later, he deserted and fled to the neighboring state of Chihuahua. He tried to work as a butcher in Hidalgo del Parro but was forced out of business by the Terrazas-Creel monopoly. In 1903, after killing an army officer and stealing his horse, he was no longer known as Arango but Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa after his paternal grandfather, Jesús Villa. However, others claim he appropriated the name from a bandit from Coahuila. He was known to his friends as &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; or (&quot;the cockroach&quot;).

Until 1910, Villa is said to have alternated episodes of thievery with more legitimate pursuits. At one point he was employed as a miner, but that stint did not have a major impact on him. Villa&#x27;s outlook on banditry changed after he met Abraham González, the local representative for presidential candidate Francisco Madero, a rich hacendado turned politician from the northern state of Coahuila, who opposed the continued rule of Díaz and convinced Villa that through his banditry he could fight for the people and hurt the hacienda owners.

At the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, Villa was 32 years old.

==Madero and Villa in the ouster of Díaz==
At the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, for Villa and men like him operating as bandits, the turmoil provided expanded horizons, &quot;a change of title, not of occupation&quot; in one assessment. Villa joined in the armed rebellion that Francisco Madero called for in 1910 to oust incumbent President Porfirio Díaz in the Plan de San Luis Potosí. In Chihuahua, the leader of the anti-re-electionists, Abraham González, reached out to Villa to join the movement. Villa captured a large hacienda, then a train of Federal Army soldiers, and the town of San Andrés. He went on to beat the Federal Army in Naica, Camargo, and Pilar de Conchos, but lost at Tecolote. Villa met in person with Madero in March 1911, as the struggle to oust Díaz was ongoing. Although Madero had created a broad movement against Díaz, he was not sufficiently radical for anarcho-syndicalists of the Mexican Liberal Party, who challenged his leadership. Madero ordered Villa to deal with the threat, which he did, disarming and arresting them. Madero rewarded Villa by promoting him to colonel in the revolutionary forces.

Much of the fighting was in the north of Mexico, near the border with the United States. Fearful of U.S. intervention, Madero ordered his officers to call off the siege of the strategic border city of Ciudad Juárez. Villa and Pascual Orozco attacked instead, capturing the city after two days of fighting, thus winning the first Battle of Ciudad Juárez in 1911.

Facing a series of defeats in many places, Díaz resigned on 25 May 1911, afterward going into exile. However, Madero signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with the Díaz regime, under which the same power structure, including the recently defeated Federal Army, was retained.

==Villa during the Madero presidency, 1911–1913==

The rebel forces, including Villa, were demobilized, and Madero called on the men of action to return to civilian life. Orozco and Villa demanded that hacienda land seized during the violence bringing Madero to power be distributed to revolutionary soldiers. Madero refused, saying that the government would buy the properties from their owners and then distribute them to the revolutionaries at some future date. According to a story recounted by Villa, he told Madero at a banquet in Ciudad Juárez after the victory in 1911, &quot;You, sir [Madero], have destroyed the revolution... It&#x27;s simple: this bunch of dandies have made a fool of you, and this will eventually cost us our necks, yours included.&quot; This proved to be the case for Madero, who was murdered during a military coup in February 1913 in a period known as the Ten Tragic Days (&quot;Decena Trágica&quot;).

Once elected president in November 1911, Madero proved a disastrous politician, dismissing his revolutionary supporters and relying on the existing power structure. Villa strongly disapproved of Madero&#x27;s decision to name Venustiano Carranza (who previously had been a staunch supporter of Diaz until Diaz refused to appoint him as Governor of Coahuila in 1909) as his Minister of War. Madero&#x27;s &quot;refusal personally to accommodate Orozco was a major political blunder.&quot; Orozco rebelled in March 1912, both for Madero&#x27;s continuing failure to enact land reform and because he felt insufficiently rewarded for his role in bringing the new president to power. At the request of Madero&#x27;s chief political ally in the state, Chihuahua Governor Abraham González, Villa returned to military service under Madero to fight the rebellion led by his former comrade Orozco. Although Orozco appealed with him to join his rebellion, Villa again gave Madero key military victories. With 400 cavalrymen, he captured Parral from the Orozquistas and then joined forces in the strategic city of Torreón with the Federal Army under the command of General Victoriano Huerta.

Huerta initially welcomed the successful Villa, and sought to bring him under his control by naming Villa an honorary brigadier general in the Federal Army, but Villa was not flattered or controlled easily. Huerta then sought to discredit and eliminate Villa by accusing him of stealing a fine horse and calling him a bandit. Villa struck Huerta, who then ordered Villa&#x27;s execution for insubordination and theft. As he was about to be executed by firing squad, he made appeal to Generals Emilio Madero and Raul Madero, brothers of President Madero. Their intervention delayed the execution until the president could be contacted by telegraph, and he ordered Huerta to spare Villa&#x27;s life but imprison him.

Villa first was imprisoned in Belem Prison, in Mexico City. While in prison he was tutored in reading and writing by Gildardo Magaña, a follower of Emiliano Zapata, revolutionary leader in Morelos. Magaña also informed him of Zapata&#x27;s Plan de Ayala, which repudiated Madero and called for land reform in Mexico. Villa was transferred to the Santiago Tlatelolco Prison on 7 June 1912. There he received further tutelage in civics and history from imprisoned Federal Army general Bernardo Reyes. Villa escaped on Christmas Day 1912, crossing into the United States near Nogales, Arizona on 2 January 1913. Arriving in El Paso, Texas, he attempted to convey a message to Madero via Abraham González about the upcoming coup d&#x27;état, to no avail; Madero was murdered in February 1913, and Huerta became president. Villa was in the U.S. when the coup occurred. With just seven men, some mules, and scant supplies, he returned into Mexico in April 1913 to fight Madero&#x27;s usurper and his own would-be executioner, President Victoriano Huerta.

==Fighting Huerta, 1913–14==


Huerta immediately moved to consolidate power. He had Abraham González, governor of Chihuahua, Madero&#x27;s ally and Villa&#x27;s mentor, murdered in March 1913. (Villa later recovered González&#x27;s remains and gave his friend and mentor a proper funeral in Chihuahua.)
The governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza, who had been appointed by Madero, also refused to recognize Huerta&#x27;s authority. He proclaimed the Plan of Guadalupe to oust Huerta as an unconstitutional usurper. Considering Carranza the lesser of two evils, Villa joined him to overthrow his old enemy, Huerta, but he also made him the butt of jokes and pranks. Carranza&#x27;s political plan gained the support of politicians and generals, including Pablo González, Álvaro Obregón, and Villa. The movement collectively was called the &quot;Ejército Constitucionalista de México&quot; (Constitutionalist Army of Mexico). The &quot;Constitucionalista&quot; adjective was added to stress the point that Huerta legally had not obtained power through lawful avenues laid out by Mexico&#x27;s Constitution of 1857. Until Huerta&#x27;s ouster, Villa joined with the revolutionary forces in the north under &quot;First Chief&quot; Carranza and his Plan of Guadalupe.

The period 1913–1914 was the time of Villa&#x27;s greatest international fame and military and political success. Through this time Villa focused on accessing funding from wealthy hacendados and raised money using methods such as forced assessments on hostile hacienda owners and train robberies. In one notable escapade, after robbing a train he held 122 bars of silver and a Wells Fargo employee hostage, forcing Wells Fargo to help him sell the bars for cash. A rapid, hard-fought series of victories at Ciudad Juárez, Tierra Blanca, Chihuahua, and Ojinaga followed.

The well-known American journalist and fiction writer Ambrose Bierce, then in his seventies, accompanied Villa&#x27;s army during this period and witnessed the Battle of Tierra Blanca. Villa considered Tierra Blanca, fought from 23 to 24 November 1913, his most spectacular victory, although General Talamantes died in the fighting. Bierce vanished on or after December 1913. His disappearance has never been solved. Oral accounts of his execution by firing squad were never verified. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Hugh L. Scott charged Villa&#x27;s American agent, Sommerfeld, with finding out what happened, but the only result of the inquiry was the finding that Bierce most likely survived after Ojinaga and died in Durango.

John Reed, who graduated from Harvard in 1910 and became a leftist journalist, wrote magazine articles that were highly important in shaping Villa&#x27;s epic image for Americans. Reed spent four months embedded with Villa&#x27;s army and published vivid word portraits of Villa, his fighting men, and the women soldaderas, who were a vital part of the fighting force. Reed&#x27;s articles were collected as &quot;Insurgent Mexico&quot; and published in 1914 for an American readership. Reed includes stories of Villa confiscating cattle, corn, and bullion and redistributing them to the poor. President Woodrow Wilson knew some version of Villa&#x27;s reputation, saying he was &quot;a sort of Robin Hood [who] had spent an eventful life robbing the rich in order to give to the poor. He had even at some point kept a butcher&#x27;s shop for the purpose of distributing to the poor the proceeds of his innumerable cattle raids.&quot;

===Governor of Chihuahua===
Villa was a brilliant tactician on the battlefield, which translated to political support. In 1913, local military commanders elected him provisional governor of the state of Chihuahua against the wishes of First Chief Carranza, who wished to name Manuel Chao instead. As Governor of Chihuahua, Villa recruited more experienced generals, including Toribio Ortega, Porfirio Talamantes, and Calixto Contreras, to his military staff and achieved more success than ever. Villa&#x27;s secretary, Pérez Rul, divided his army into two groups, one led by Ortega, Contreras, and Orestes Pereira and the other led by Talamantes and Contreras&#x27; former deputy, Severianco Ceniceros.

As governor of Chihuahua, Villa raised more money for a drive to the south against Huerta&#x27;s Federal Army by various methods. He printed his own currency and decreed that it could be traded and accepted at par with gold Mexican pesos. He forced the wealthy to give loans to fund the revolutionary war machinery. He confiscated gold from several banks, and in the case of the Banco Minero he held a member of the bank&#x27;s owning family, the wealthy Terrazas clan, as a hostage until the location of the bank&#x27;s hidden gold reserves was revealed. He also appropriated land owned by the &quot;hacendados&quot; (owners of the &quot;haciendas&quot;) and redistributed the money generated by the &quot;haciendas&quot; to fund military efforts and the pensions of citizens who had lost family members in the revolution. Villa also decreed that after the completion of the revolution the land would be redistributed, away from the hands of the oligarchy, to revolutionary veterans, former owners of the land from before the &quot;hacendados&quot; took the land, and the state itself in equal parts. These motions accompanied with gifts and cost reductions for poorer sections of the state represented large changes from previous revolutionary governments, and led to large support for Villa in significant portions of Chihuahua&#x27;s population. After four weeks as the governor Villa retired from the position at the suggestion of Carranza, leaving Manuel Chao as governor.

With so many sources of money, Villa expanded and modernized his forces, purchasing draft animals, cavalry horses, arms, ammunition, mobile hospital facilities (railroad cars and horse ambulances staffed with Mexican and foreign volunteer doctors, known as &quot;Servicio sanitario&quot;), and other supplies, and rebuilt the railroad south of Chihuahua City. He also recruited fighters from Chihuahua and Durango and created a large army known as the &quot;Division del Norte (Division of the North)&quot;, the most powerful and feared military unit in all of Mexico. The rebuilt railroad transported Villa&#x27;s troops and artillery south, where he defeated the Federal Army forces in a series of battles at Gómez Palacio, Torreón, and eventually at the heart of Huerta&#x27;s regime in Zacatecas.

===Victory at Zacatecas, 1914===

After Villa captured the strategic prize of Torreón, Carranza ordered Villa to break off action south of Torreón and instead to divert to attack Saltillo. He threatened to cut off Villa&#x27;s coal supply, immobilizing his supply trains, if he did not comply. This was seen widely as an attempt by Carranza to divert Villa from a direct assault on Mexico City in order to allow Carranza&#x27;s forces under Obregón, driving in from the west via Guadalajara, to take the capital first. This was an expensive and disruptive diversion for the &quot;División del Norte&quot;. Villa&#x27;s enlisted men were not unpaid volunteers but paid soldiers, earning the then enormous sum of one peso per day. Each day of delay cost thousands of pesos.

Disgusted but having no practical alternative, Villa complied with Carranza&#x27;s order and captured the less important city of Saltillo, and proceeded to give control of the land to Carranza in the hope of ending the hostility between the two. Carranza refused to reach any compromise with Villa, and ordered that 5000 members of the &quot;División del Norte&quot; be sent to Zacatecas to assist in its capture. A Constitutionalist general had recently staged an attack that had failed due to the superior artillery of the federal forces. Villa believed that sending troops to assist would only lead to the same result unless he was to lead the attack himself. Carranza declined to rescind the order as he did not want Villa to receive the credit as the victor of Zacatecas. Upon receiving Carranza&#x27;s refusal Villa resigned from his post, which further led to the majority of revolutionary generals rallying behind Villa. Felipe Ángeles and the rest of Villa&#x27;s staff officers argued for Villa to withdraw his resignation, and proceed to attack Zacatecas, a strategic railroad station heavily defended by Federal troops and considered nearly impregnable. Zacatecas was the source of much of Mexico&#x27;s silver, and thus a supply of funds for whoever held it. Villa accepted his staff&#x27;s advice and cancelled his resignation, and the &quot;División del Norte&quot; defied Carranza and attacked Zacatecas. Fighting up steep slopes, the &quot;División del Norte&quot; defeated a force of 12,000 Federals in the &quot;Toma de Zacatecas&quot; (Taking of Zacatecas), the single bloodiest battle of the Revolution, with Federal casualties numbering approximately 7,000 dead and 5,000 wounded, and unknown numbers of civilian casualties.

Villa&#x27;s victory at Zacatecas in June 1914 broke the back of the Huerta regime. Huerta left the country on 14 July 1914. The Federal Army collapsed, ceasing to exist as an institution. As Villa moved towards the capital his progress was halted due to a lack of coal to fuel the railroad engines, and critically, an embargo placed by the U.S. government on importation to Mexico. Before this Villa had strong relationships with the Wilson administration, due in part to Carranza&#x27;s distinctly anti-American rhetoric with which Villa publicly disagreed. Although nothing had changed for Villa historian Friedrich Katz writes that the exact motives of the U.S. government are hotly contested, it is likely that it was attempting to establish some type of control over Mexico by not allowing any one faction to become powerful enough to not need U.S. assistance.

==Break with Carranza, 1914==
The break between Villa and Carranza had been anticipated. The Pact of Torreón, an agreement between the Division of the Northeast and Villa&#x27;s Division of the North, was a stopgap to keep the Constitutionalists united prior to the defeat of the Federal Army. The pact was ostensibly an updating of Carranza&#x27;s narrow Plan of Guadalupe, adding radical language about land distribution and sanctions for the Roman Catholic Church for its support of Huerta. Neither Villa nor Carranza took the provisions of the pact seriously, one which was for Carranza to renew the flow of ammunition to Villa and supply coal so his troops could be transported by train. The truce between Villa and Carranza held long enough for the final defeat and dissolution of the Federal Army. In August 1914, Carranza and his revolutionary army entered Mexico City ahead of Villa.

The unity of fighting against Huerta was no longer the underpinnings of the Constitutionalists under Carranza&#x27;s leadership. Carranza was a wealthy estate owner and governor of Coahuila, and he considered Villa little more than a bandit, despite his military successes. Villa viewed Carranza as a soft civilian, while Villa&#x27;s Division of the North was the largest and most successful revolutionary army. In August and September Obregón traveled to meet with and persuade Villa not to fracture the Constitutionalist movement. In their August meeting, the two agreed that Carranza should now take the title of interim president of Mexico, now that Huerta had been ousted. Despite the generals&#x27; joint petition, Carranza did not want to do that, since it would have meant being ineligible to run in the expected presidential election. The two also agreed that there should be immediate action on land reform. They also agreed that the military needed to be separated from politics. By the time of Obregón&#x27;s second meeting with Villa in September, Obregón had given up on coming to an agreement with him, but he hoped to lure soldiers of the Division of the North away from Villa, sensing that some disapproved of Villa&#x27;s violent tendencies. During the visit, Villa became incensed at Obregón and called for a firing squad to execute him immediately. Obregón soothed him and Villa dismissed the squad. Villa allowed Obregón to leave by train to Mexico City, but then Villa attempted to stop the train and bring Obregón back to Chihuahua. The telegram was not received or was ignored, and Obregón arrived safely in the capital. Even though Obregón had his differences with Carranza, his two visits with Villa convinced him to remain loyal for the moment to the civilian First Chief. Obregón saw Villa &quot;as a bandit who would not keep his promises.&quot; Villa broke with Carranza in September 1914 and issued a manifesto.

==Alliance with Zapata against Carranza, 1914–15==

Once Huerta was ousted, the power struggle between factions of the revolution came into the open. The revolutionary caudillos convened the Convention of Aguascalientes, attempting to sort out power in the political sphere rather than on the battlefield. This meeting set out a path towards democracy. None of the armed revolutionaries were allowed to be nominated for government positions, and Eulalio Gutiérrez was chosen as interim president. Emiliano Zapata, a military general from southern Mexico also sent a number of delegates to the convention, however these delegates did not participate until they were convinced the convention aimed for true reform, and an alliance was made between Zapata&#x27;s forces and Villa&#x27;s. Zapata was sympathetic to Villa&#x27;s hostile views of Carranza and told Villa he feared Carranza&#x27;s intentions were those of a dictator and not of a democratic president. Fearing that Carranza was intending to impose a dictatorship, Villa and Zapata broke with him. Carranza opposed the agreements of the convention, which rejected his leadership as &quot;first chief&quot; of the revolution. The Army of the convention was constituted with the alliance of Villa and Zapata, and a civil war of the winners ensued. Although both Villa and Zapata were defeated in their attempt to advance an alternative state power, their social demands were copied (in their way) by their adversaries (Obregón and Carranza).

Carranza and Alvaro Obregón retreated to Veracruz, leaving Villa and Zapata to occupy Mexico City. Although Villa had a more formidable army and had demonstrated his brilliance in battle against the now-defunct Federal Army, Carranza&#x27;s general Obregón was a better tactician. With Obregón&#x27;s help, Carranza was able to use the Mexican press to portray Villa as a sociopathic bandit and undermine his standing with the U.S. In late 1914, Villa was dealt an additional blow with the death from typhus of Toribio Ortega, one of his top generals.

While Convention forces occupied Mexico City, Carranza maintained control over two key Mexican states, Veracruz and Tamaulipas, where Mexico&#x27;s two largest ports were located. Carranza was able to collect more revenue than Villa. In 1915, Villa was forced to abandon the capital after a number of incidents involving his troops, which helped pave the way for the return of Carranza and his followers.

To combat Villa, Carranza sent his ablest general Obregón north, who defeated Villa in a series of battles. Meeting at the Battle of Celaya in the Bajío, Villa and Obregón first fought from 6 to 15 April 1915, and Villa&#x27;s army was defeated badly, suffering 4,000 killed and 6,000 captured. Obregón engaged Villa again at the Battle of Trinidad, which was fought between 29 April and 5 June 1915, where Villa suffered another huge loss. In October 1915, Villa crossed into Sonora, the main stronghold of Obregón and Carranza&#x27;s armies, where he hoped to crush Carranza&#x27;s regime. However, Carranza had reinforced Sonora, and Villa again was defeated badly. Rodolfo Fierro, a loyal officer and cruel hatchet man, was killed while Villa&#x27;s army was crossing into Sonora.

After losing the Battle of Agua Prieta in Sonora, an overwhelming number of Villa&#x27;s men in the &quot;Division del Norte&quot; were killed and 1,500 of the army&#x27;s surviving members soon turned on him, accepting an amnesty offer from Carranza. &quot;Villa&#x27;s army [was] reduced to the condition to which it had reduced Huerta&#x27;s in 1914. The celebrated Division of the North thus was eliminated as a capital military force.&quot;

In November 1915, Carranza&#x27;s forces captured and executed Contreras, Pereyra, and son. Severianco Ceniceros also accepted amnesty from Carranza and turned on Villa as well. Although Villa&#x27;s secretary Perez Rul also broke with Villa, he refused to become a supporter of Carranza.

Only 200 men in Villa&#x27;s army remained loyal to him, and he was forced to retreat back into the mountains of Chihuahua. However, Villa and his men were determined to keep fighting Carranza&#x27;s forces. Villa&#x27;s position further was weakened by the United States&#x27; refusal to sell him weapons. By the end of 1915, Villa was on the run and the United States government recognized Carranza.

== From national leader to guerrilla leader, 1915–20 ==


The period after Villa&#x27;s defeat by Obregón has many dark episodes. His fighting force had shrunk significantly, no longer an army. Villa&#x27;s opponents believed him finished as a factor in the Revolution. He decided to split his remaining forces into independent bands under his authority, ban soldaderas, and take to the hills as guerrillas. This strategy was effective and one that Villa knew well from his bandit days. He had loyal followers from western Chihuahua and northern Durango. A pattern of towns being under government control and the countryside under guerrilla control reasserted itself. Civilian populations during warfare are often the victims of violence. In Namiquipa, Villa sought to punish civilians who had formed a home guard, but when they learned Villa&#x27;s men were approaching the village men took to the hills, leaving their families behind. Villa rounded up the wives and allowed his soldiers to rape them. The story of the rapes in Namiquipa was spread throughout Chihuahua.
Some historians have contended that crimes that he did not commit have been attributed to him; in addition, his enemies always told false stories to increase his status as an &quot;evil person&quot;, since there were cases of bandits who were not part of the revolution and committed crimes which were later attributed to Villa.

After years of public and documented support for Villa&#x27;s fight, the United States refused to allow more arms to be supplied to his army, and allowed Carranza&#x27;s troops to be relocated over U.S. railroads in the Second Battle of Aguaprieta. Woodrow Wilson believed that supporting Carranza was the best way to expedite establishment of a stable Mexican government. Villa was further enraged by Obregón&#x27;s use of searchlights, powered by U.S. generated electricity, to help repel a &quot;Villista&quot; night attack on the border town of Agua Prieta, Sonora on 1 November 1915. In Mexico and U.S. bordering towns, a vendetta was launched by Villa against Americans as he blamed Wilson for his defeat against Carranza. In January 1916, a group of &quot;Villistas&quot; attacked a train on the Mexico North Western Railway, near Santa Isabel, Chihuahua, and killed a number of U.S. nationals employed by the American Smelting and Refining Company. The passengers included eighteen Americans, 15 of whom worked for American Smelting. There was only one survivor, who gave the details to the press. Villa admitted to ordering the attack, but denied that he had authorized the shedding of blood of U.S. citizens.

After meeting with a Mexican mayor named Juan Muñoz, Villa recruited more men into his guerrilla militia and had 400 men under his command. Villa then met with his lieutenants Martin Lopez, Pablo Lopez, Francisco Beltran, and Candelario Cervantes, and commissioned an additional 100 men to the command of Joaquin Alvarez, Bernabe Cifuentes, and Ernesto Rios. Pablo Lopez and Cervantes were later killed in the early part of 1916. Villa and his 500 guerrillas then started planning an attack on U.S. soil.

===Attack on New Mexico===

On 9 March 1916, General Villa ordered nearly 100 Mexican members of his revolutionary group to make a cross-border attack against Columbus, New Mexico. Some historians believe that Villa attacked Columbus due to his concern for what Villa believed was American imperialistic interference in Mexican internal affairs.

From a purely military standpoint Villa carried out the raid because he needed more military equipment and supplies in order to continue his fight against Carranza. Many believed the raid was conducted because of the U.S. government&#x27;s official recognition of the Carranza regime and for the loss of lives in battle due to defective cartridges purchased from the U.S., 

They attacked a detachment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment (United States), burned the town, and seized 100 horses and mules and other military supplies. Eighteen Americans and about 80 Villistas were killed.

Other attacks in U.S. territory allegedly were carried out by Villa, but none of these attacks were confirmed to have been carried out by Villistas. These were:
* 15 May 1916. Glenn Springs, Texas – one civilian was killed, three American soldiers were wounded, and two Mexicans were estimated killed.
* 15 June 1916. San Ygnacio, Texas – four soldiers were killed and five soldiers were wounded by bandits, six Mexicans were killed.
* 31 July 1916. Fort Hancock, Texas – two American soldiers were killed. The two dead soldiers were from the 8th Cavalry Regiment and Customs Inspector Robert Wood. One American was wounded, three Mexicans were reported killed, and three Mexicans were captured by Mexican government troops.

===U.S. Expedition to capture Villa===

As result of Villa&#x27;s raid on Columbus, President Wilson chose to take action. Publicly it was announced that General Pershing would be sent to Mexico to capture Villa. In a private order to General Pershing, Pershing was told to cease the search for Villa once Villa&#x27;s armies had been broken up.

President Wilson sent 5,000 U.S. Army soldiers under the command of General Frederick Funston, who oversaw John Pershing as he pursued Villa through Mexico. Employing aircraft and trucks for the first time in U.S. Army history, Pershing&#x27;s force fruitlessly pursued Villa until February 1917. Villa eluded them, but some of his senior commanders, including Colonel Candelario Cervantes, General Francisco Beltrán, Beltrán&#x27;s son, Villa&#x27;s second-in-command Julio Cárdenas, and a total of 190 of his men were killed during the expedition.

The Carranza government and the Mexican population were against U.S. troops violating Mexican territories. There were several demonstrations of opposition to the Punitive Expedition. During the expedition, Carranza&#x27;s forces captured one of Villa&#x27;s top generals, Pablo López, and executed him on 5 June 1916.

===German involvement in Villa&#x27;s later campaigns===
Before the Villa-Carranza irregular forces had left to the mountains in 1915, there is no credible evidence that Villa cooperated with or accepted any help from the German government or agents. Villa was supplied arms from the U.S., employed international mercenaries and doctors including Americans, was portrayed as a hero in the U.S. media, made business arrangements with Hollywood, and did not object to the 1914 U.S. naval occupation of Veracruz. Villa&#x27;s observation was that the occupation merely hurt Huerta. Villa opposed the armed participation of the United States in Mexico, but he did not act against the Veracruz occupation in order to maintain the connections in the U.S. that were necessary to buy American cartridges and other supplies. The German consul in Torreón made entreaties to Villa, offering him arms and money to occupy the port and oil fields of Tampico to enable German ships to dock there, but Villa rejected the offer.

German agents tried to interfere in the Mexican Revolution but were unsuccessful. They attempted to plot with Victoriano Huerta to assist him to retake the country and, in the infamous Zimmermann Telegram to the Mexican government, proposed an alliance with the government of Venustiano Carranza.

There were documented contacts between Villa and the Germans after Villa&#x27;s split with the Constitutionalists. This was principally in the person of Felix A. Sommerfeld (noted in Katz&#x27;s book), who allegedly funneled $340,000 of German money to the Western Cartridge Company in 1915, to purchase ammunition. Sommerfeld had been Villa&#x27;s representative in the United States since 1914 and had close contact with the German naval attaché in Washington Karl Boy-Ed, as well as other German agents in the United States including Franz von Rintelen and Horst von der Goltz. In May 1914, Sommerfeld formally entered the employ of Boy-Ed and the German secret service in the United States. However, Villa&#x27;s actions were hardly that of a German ; rather, it appeared that Villa resorted to German assistance only after other sources of money and arms were cut off.

At the time of Villa&#x27;s 1916 attack on Columbus, New Mexico, Villa&#x27;s military power had been marginalized. He was repulsed at Columbus by a small cavalry detachment, albeit after doing a lot of damage. His theater of operations was limited mainly to western Chihuahua. He was persona non grata with Mexico&#x27;s ruling Carranza constitutionalists and was the subject of an embargo by the U.S., so communication or further shipments of arms between the Germans and Villa would have been difficult.

A plausible explanation for contacts between Villa and the Germans, after 1915, is that they were a futile extension of increasingly desperate German diplomatic efforts and &quot;Villista&quot; dreams of victory as progress of their respective wars bogged down. Villa effectively did not have anything useful to offer in exchange for German help at that point. When assessing claims of Villa conspiring with Germans, portrayal of Villa as a German sympathizer served the propaganda needs of both Carranza and Wilson and has to be taken into account.

The use of Mauser rifles and carbines by Villa&#x27;s forces does not necessarily indicate a German connection. These weapons were used widely by all parties in the Mexican Revolution, Mauser longarms being enormously popular. They were standard issue in the Mexican Army, which had begun adopting 7 mm Mauser system arms as early as 1895.

== Final years: leader to hacienda owner, 1920–23 ==
Following his unsuccessful military campaign at Celaya and the 1916 incursion into New Mexico, prompting the unsuccessful U.S. military intervention in Mexico to capture him, Villa ceased to be a national leader and became a leader in Chihuahua. While Villa still remained active, Carranza shifted his focus to dealing with the more dangerous threat posed by Zapata in the south. Villa&#x27;s last major military action was a raid against Ciudad Juárez in 1919. Following the raid, Villa suffered yet another major blow after Felipe Angeles, who had returned to Mexico in 1918 after living in exile for three years as a dairy farmer in Texas, left Villa and his small remaining militia. Angeles later was captured by Carranza&#x27;s forces and was executed on 26 November 1919.

Villa continued fighting, and conducted a small siege in Ascención, Durango, after his failed raid in Ciudad Juárez. The siege failed, and Villa&#x27;s new second-in-command, his longtime lieutenant Martín López, was killed during the fighting. At this point Villa agreed that he would cease fighting if it were made worth his while.

On 21 May 1920, a break for Villa came when Carranza, along with his top advisers and supporters, was assassinated by supporters of Álvaro Obregón. With his nemesis dead, Villa was now ready to negotiate a peace settlement and retire. On 22 July 1920, Villa finally was able to send a telegram to Mexican interim President Adolfo de la Huerta, which stated that he recognized De la Huerta&#x27;s presidency and requested amnesty. Six days later, De la Huerta met with Villa and negotiated a peace settlement.

In exchange for his retirement from hostilities, Villa was granted a 25,000 acre hacienda in Canutillo, just outside Hidalgo del Parral, Chihuahua, by the national government. This was in addition to the Quinta Luz estate that he owned with his wife, María Luz Corral de Villa, in Chihuahua, Chihuahua. The last remaining 200 guerrillas and veterans of Villa&#x27;s militia who were still loyal to him would reside with him in his new hacienda as well, and the Mexican government also granted them a pension that totalled 500,000 gold pesos. The 50 guerrillas who still remained in Villa&#x27;s small cavalry would be allowed to serve as Villa&#x27;s personal bodyguards.

==Personal life==

As Villa&#x27;s biographer Friedrich Katz has noted, &quot;During his lifetime, Villa had never bothered with conventional arrangements in his family life&quot; and he contracted several marriages without seeking annulment or divorce. On 29 May 1911, Villa married María Luz Corral, who has been described as &quot;The most articulate of his many wives.&quot; Villa met her when she was living with her widowed mother in San Andrés, where Villa for a time had his headquarters. Anti-reelectionists threatened the locals for monetary contributions to their cause, which the two women could not afford. The widow Corral did not want to seem a counter-revolutionary and went to Villa, who allowed her to make a token contribution to the cause. Villa sought Luz Corral as his wife, but her mother was opposed; however, the two were married by a priest &quot;in a great ceremony, attended by his military chiefs and a representative of the governor.&quot; A photo of Corral with Villa, dated 1914, has been published in a collection of photos from the Revolution. It shows a sturdy woman with her hair in a bun, wearing a floor-length embellished skirt and a white blouse, with a rebozo beside a smiling Villa. After Villa&#x27;s death, Luz Corral&#x27;s marriage to Villa was challenged in court twice, and both times it was upheld as valid. Together, Villa and Luz Corral had one child, a daughter, who died within a few years after birth.

Villa had long-term relationships with several women. Austreberta Rentería was Villa&#x27;s &quot;official wife&quot; at his hacienda of Canutillo, and Villa had two sons with her, Francisco and Hipólito.

Others were Soledad Seañez, Juana Torres, whom he wed in 1913 and with whom he had a daughter.

Still another woman in Villa&#x27;s life was Manuela Casas, with whom Villa had a son named Trinidad Villa. He became John Wayne&#x27;s double in many movies in the state of Durango. Manuela Casas would be the last woman who saw him alive in Parral, Chihuahua.

At the time of Villa&#x27;s assassination in 1923, Luz Corral was banished from Canutillo. However, she was recognized by Mexican courts as Villa&#x27;s legal wife and therefore heir to Villa&#x27;s estate. President Obregón intervened in the dispute between competing claims to Villa&#x27;s estate in Luz Corral&#x27;s favor, perhaps because she had saved his life when Villa threatened to execute him in 1914.

Rentería and Seañez eventually were granted small government pensions decades after Villa&#x27;s death. Corral inherited Villa&#x27;s estate and played a key role in maintaining his public memory. All three women were often present at ceremonies at Villa&#x27;s grave in Parral. When Villa&#x27;s remains were transferred in 1976 to the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City, Corral refused to attend the huge ceremony. She died at the age of 89 on 6 July 1981.

An alleged son of Pancho Villa, the lieutenant colonel Octavio Villa Coss, born to Guadalupe Cos Dominguez in Rancho de Santiago, Chihuahua in 1914. He reportedly was killed by Juan Nepomuceno Guerra, a legendary drug lord from the Gulf Cartel, in 1960.

Villa&#x27;s last living son, Ernesto Nava, died in Castro Valley, California, at the age of 94 on 31 December 2009. Nava appeared yearly in festival events in his hometown of Durango, Mexico, enjoying celebrity status until he became too weak to attend.

==Ambush and death==

On 20 July 1923, Villa was shot and killed in an ambush while visiting Parral, most likely on the orders of political enemies Plutarco Elías Calles and President Alvaro Obregón. He frequently made trips from his ranch to Parral, where he generally felt secure, for banking and other errands. Villa usually was accompanied by his large entourage of armed &quot;Dorados&quot;, or bodyguards, but on that day he had gone into town without most of them, taking with him only three bodyguards and two other ranch employees. He went to pick up a consignment of gold from the local bank with which to pay his Canutillo ranch staff. While driving back through the city in his black 1919 Dodge touring car, Villa passed by a school, and a pumpkinseed vendor ran toward his car and shouted &quot;Viva Villa!&quot;, a signal to a group of seven riflemen who then appeared in the middle of the road and fired more than 40 rounds into the automobile. In the fusillade, nine dumdum bullets, normally used for hunting big game, hit Villa in the head and upper chest, killing him instantly.

Claro Huertado (a bodyguard), Rafael Madreno (Villa&#x27;s main personal bodyguard), Daniel Tamayo (his personal secretary), and Colonel Miguel Trillo (who also served as his chauffeur) were also killed. One of Villa&#x27;s bodyguards, Ramon Contreras, was wounded badly but managed to kill at least one of the assassins before he escaped; Contreras was the only survivor. Villa is reported to have died saying &quot;Don&#x27;t let it end like this. Tell them I said something,&quot; but there is no contemporary evidence that he survived his shooting even momentarily. Historian and biographer Friedrich Katz wrote in 1998 that Villa died instantly. &quot;Time&quot; also reported in 1951 that both Villa and his aide (Tamayo) were killed instantly.

Telegraph service was interrupted to Villa&#x27;s hacienda of Canutillo, probably so that Obregón&#x27;s officials could secure the estate and &quot;to prevent a possible Villista uprising triggered by his assassination.&quot;

The next day, Villa&#x27;s funeral was held and thousands of his grieving supporters in Parral followed his casket to his burial site while Villa&#x27;s men and his closest friends remained at the Canutillo hacienda armed and ready for an attack by the government troops. The six surviving assassins hid out in the desert and were soon captured, but only two of them served a few months in jail, and the rest were commissioned into the military.

Villa was likely assassinated because he was talking publicly about re-entering politics as the 1924 elections neared. Obregón could not run again for the presidency, so there was political uncertainty about the presidential succession. Obregón favored fellow Sonoran general Plutarco Elías Calles for the presidency. If Villa did re-enter politics, it would complicate the political situation for Obregón and the Sonoran generals. Assassinating Villa benefited the plans of Obregón, who chose someone who in no way matched his power and charisma, and Calles, who ardently wanted to be president of Mexico at any cost. It has never been proven who was responsible for the assassination, but according to Villa&#x27;s biographer Friedrich Katz, Jesús Salas Barraza took responsibility to shield Obregón and Calles. Most historians attribute Villa&#x27;s death to a well-planned conspiracy most likely initiated by Plutarco Elías Calles and his associate, General Joaquín Amaro with at least tacit approval of Obregón.

At the time, a state legislator from Durango, Jesús Salas Barraza, whom Villa once whipped during a quarrel over a woman, claimed sole responsibility for the plot. Barraza admitted that he told his friend, who worked as a dealer for General Motors, that he would kill Villa if he were paid 50,000 pesos. The friend was not wealthy and did not have 50,000 pesos on hand, so he collected money from enemies of Villa and managed to collect a total of 100,000 pesos for Barraza and his other co-conspirators. Barraza also admitted that he and his co-conspirators watched Villa&#x27;s daily car rides and paid the pumpkinseed vendor at the scene of Villa&#x27;s assassination to shout &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; either once if Villa was sitting in the front part of the car or twice if he was sitting in the back.

Obregón gave in to the people&#x27;s demands and had Barraza detained. Initially sentenced to 20 years in prison, Barraza&#x27;s sentence was commuted to three months by the governor of Chihuahua, and Salas Barraza eventually became a colonel in the Mexican Army. In a letter to the governor of Durango, Jesús Castro, Salas Barraza agreed to be the &quot;fall guy,&quot; and the same arrangement is mentioned in letters exchanged between Castro and Amaro. Others involved in the conspiracy were Félix Lara, the commander of federal troops in Parral who was paid 50,000 pesos by Calles to remove his soldiers and policemen from the town on the day of the assassination, and Melitón Lozoya, the former owner of Villa&#x27;s hacienda from whom Villa was demanding payback funds he had embezzled. It was Lozoya who planned the details of the assassination and found the men who carried it out. It was reported that before Salas Barraza died of a stroke in his Mexico City home in 1951, his last words were &quot;I&#x27;m not a murderer. I rid humanity of a monster.&quot;

===Aftermath of his death===
Villa was buried the day after his assassination in the city cemetery of Parral, Chihuahua, rather than in Chihuahua city, where he had built a mausoleum. Villa&#x27;s skull was stolen from his grave in 1926. According to local folklore, an American treasure hunter, Emil Holmdahl, beheaded him to sell his skull to an eccentric millionaire who collected the heads of historic figures. The skull is rumored to be in the possession of Yale University&#x27;s Skull and Bones Society, a claim they deny. His remains were reburied in the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City in 1976. The Francisco Villa Museum is a museum dedicated to Villa located at the site of his assassination in Parral.

Villa&#x27;s purported death mask was hidden at the Radford School in El Paso, Texas until the 1980s, when it was sent to the Historical Museum of the Mexican Revolution in Chihuahua. Other museums have ceramic and bronze representations that do not match this mask.

==Legacy==

According to Pancho Villa&#x27;s major biographer, Friedrich Katz, the revolutionary was perceived as a destroyer, but in Katz&#x27;s assessment, there were positive aspects to that. Villa played a decisive role not just in the destruction of Huerta&#x27;s regime, but also the entire old regime. During Villa&#x27;s brief time as governor of Chihuahua, . In his confiscation of landed estates and expulsion of their owners, he weakened that class. In the 1930s President Lázaro Cárdenas finished the dismantling of the old landed system. Villa&#x27;s raid on Columbus, New Mexico destroyed the burgeoning cooperation between the Carranza government and the United States and goaded the U.S. into invading northern Mexico. Banks in the U.S. ceased lending to the Carranza government, blocking its ability to suppress peasant rebellions in Morelos, San Luis Potosí, and Villa&#x27;s. Katz credits Villa&#x27;s time as governor as highly effective and economically beneficial to the general populace. &quot;In some ways, it might be called the first welfare state in Mexico.&quot;

With his remains now buried in the Monument to the Revolution, Villa was also honored with adding his name to the wall of Mexican heroes in the Chamber of Deputies. In both cases of official recognition there was considerable controversy. The fact that Villa&#x27;s image and legacy were not quickly appropriated and manipulated by the ruling party the way Zapata&#x27;s was kept Villa&#x27;s memory and myth in the hearts of the people. &quot;Popular tastes wanted Villa to be thrilling, not respectable. They were enamored of Villa the daring Robin Hood, the satyr and monster, the unpredictable deviant, the grimy &quot;guerrillero&quot; and outlaw with uncanny power over men.&quot;

Villa is not universally acclaimed. Historian Alan Knight wrote a massive, two-volume history of the Mexican Revolution, but in a thousand pages of text, Knight has only scattered references to Villa. He emphasizes Villa&#x27;s bandit past, for whom the Revolution provided a change of title, not of occupation.

Of the major figures of the Revolution, Villa and Zapata are best known to the general public, as defenders of the dispossessed. In contrast, those who came to hold political power, Madero, Carranza, and Obregón are unfamiliar to most outside Mexico. It took decades for Villa to receive official recognition as a hero of the Revolution. As with the others entombed in the Monument to the Revolution, his remains rest near some whom he fought fiercely in life, including Venustiano Carranza. One scholar notes, &quot;In death as in life, Carranza would be eclipsed by Francisco Villa.&quot;

The Mexican government declared the year 2023 to be the &quot;Year of Francisco Villa&quot; (&quot;Año de Francisco Villa&quot;) to honor Villa&#x27;s legacy in the Mexican Revolution.

<text>Scapa Flow (; ) is a body of water in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, sheltered by the islands of Mainland, Graemsay, Burray, South Ronaldsay and Hoy. Its sheltered waters have played an important role in travel, trade and conflict throughout the centuries. Vikings anchored their longships in Scapa Flow more than a thousand years ago. It was the United Kingdom&#x27;s chief naval base during the First and Second World wars, but the facility was closed in 1956.

Since the scuttling of the German fleet after World War I, its wrecks and their marine habitats form an internationally acclaimed diving location.

Scapa Flow hosts an oil port, the Flotta oil terminal. In good weather, its roadstead (water of moderate conditions) allows ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil product. The world&#x27;s first ship-to-ship transfer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) took place in Scapa Flow in 2007 transferring 132,000m³ of LNG. This occurred in 2007 by Excelerate Energy between the vessels &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Excelsior&quot;.

==Environment==
Scapa Flow has a shallow sandy bottom not deeper than and most of it is about deep; it is one of the great natural harbours and anchorages of the world, with sufficient space to hold multiple navies. The harbour has an area of .

===Important Bird Area===
Scapa Flow has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of wintering velvet scoters, horned grebes, common loons, European shags and Eurasian curlews, as well as breeding black guillemots.

==History==
===Viking era===

The Viking expeditions to Orkney are recorded in detail in the 11th century &quot;Orkneyinga sagas&quot; and later texts such as the &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot;.

According to the latter, King Haakon IV of Norway anchored his fleet, including the flagship &quot;Kroussden&quot; that could carry nearly 300 men, on 5 August 1263 at St Margaret&#x27;s Hope, where he saw an eclipse of the sun before he sailed south to the Battle of Largs.

En route back to Norway Haakon anchored some of his fleet in Scapa Flow for the winter, but he died that December while staying at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Kirkwall. In the 15th century towards the end of Norse rule in Orkney, the islands were run by the &quot;jarls&quot; from large manor farms, some of which were at Burray, Burwick, Paplay, Hoy, and Cairston (near Stromness) to guard the entrances to the Flow.

===Wars of the Three Kingdoms===

In 1650 during the wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Royalist general James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, moored his ship, the &quot;Herderinnan&quot;, in Scapa Flow, in preparation for his attempt to raise a rebellion in Scotland. The enterprise ended in failure and rout at the Battle of Carbisdale.

=== First World War ===
====Base for the British Grand Fleet====

Historically, the main British naval bases were near the English Channel to counter the continental naval powers: the Dutch Republic, France, and Spain.

In 1904, in response to the build-up of the German &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;&#x27;s High Seas Fleet, Britain decided that a northern base was needed to control the entrances to the North Sea, as part of a revised policy of &#x27;distant&#x27; rather than &#x27;close&#x27; blockade. First Rosyth in Fife was considered, then Invergordon at Cromarty Firth. Delayed construction left these largely unfortified by the outbreak of the First World War. Scapa Flow had been used many times for British exercises in the years before the war and when the time came for the fleet to move to a northern station, it was chosen for the main base of the British Grand Fleet—unfortified.

John Rushworth Jellicoe, admiral of the Grand Fleet, was perpetually nervous about the possibility of submarine or destroyer attacks on Scapa Flow. Whilst the fleet spent almost the first year of the war patrolling the west coast of the British Isles, their base at Scapa was defensively reinforced, beginning with over sixty blockships sunk in the many entrance channels between the southern islands to enable the use of submarine nets and booms. These blocked approaches were backed by minefields, artillery, and concrete barriers.

Two attempts to enter the harbour were made by German U-boats during the war and neither was successful:
# tried to enter in November 1914. A trawler searching for submarines rammed her, causing her to leak, prompting her flight and surfacing; one crew member died. 
# made a foray in October 1918 but encountered the sophisticated defences then in place. It was detected by hydrophones before entering the anchorage, then destroyed by shore-triggered mines, killing all 36 hands.

After the Battle of Jutland, the German High Seas Fleet rarely ventured out of its bases at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel and in the last two years of the war the British fleet was considered to have such a commanding superiority of the seas that some components moved south to the first-class dockyard at Rosyth.

====Scuttling of the German fleet====
Following the German defeat, 74 ships of the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s High Seas Fleet were interned in Gutter Sound at Scapa Flow pending a decision on their future in the peace Treaty of Versailles.

On 21 June 1919, after seven months of waiting, German Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter made the decision to scuttle the fleet because the negotiation period for the treaty had lapsed with no word of a settlement. He was not kept informed that there had been a last-minute extension to finalise the details.

After waiting for the bulk of the British fleet to leave on exercises, he gave the order to scuttle the ships to prevent their falling into British hands. The Royal Navy made desperate efforts to board the ships to prevent the sinkings, but the German crews had spent the idle months preparing for the order, welding bulkhead doors open, laying charges in vulnerable parts of the ships, and quietly dropping important keys and tools overboard so valves could not be shut.

The Royal Navy managed to beach the battleship , the light cruisers &quot;Emden&quot;, &quot;Nürnberg&quot;, and &quot;Frankfurt&quot; and 18 destroyers whereas 53 ships, the vast bulk of the High Seas Fleet, were sunk. Nine German sailors died on some of these ships when British forces opened fire as they attempted to scuttle the ships, reputedly the last casualties of the war.

 was amongst the ships the British managed to beach. This &quot;Emden&quot; should not be confused with her predecessor, destroyed in the Battle of Cocos on 9 November 1914 by the Australian light cruiser .

At least seven of the scuttled German ships and some sunken British ships can today be visited by divers.

===Salvage operation===

Although many of the larger ships turned turtle and came to rest upside down or on their sides in relatively deep water (25–45 m), some—including the battlecruiser —were left with parts of their superstructure or upturned bows still protruding from the water or just below the surface.

These ships posed a severe hazard to navigation; small boats, trawlers, and drifters regularly became snagged on them with the rise and fall of the tides. The Admiralty initially declared that there would be no attempt at salvage, that the sunken hulks would remain where they were, to &#x27;rest and rust.&#x27; In the first few years after the war, there was abundant scrap metal as a result of the huge quantities of leftover tanks, artillery and ordnance. By the early 1920s, the situation had changed.

In 1922, the Admiralty invited tenders from interested parties for the salvage of the sunken ships, although at the time few believed that it would be possible to raise the deeper wrecks. The contract went to a wealthy engineer and scrap metal merchant, Ernest Cox, who created a new company, a division of Cox &amp; Danks Ltd, for the venture, and so began what is often called the greatest maritime salvage operation of all time.

During the next eight years, Cox and his workforce of divers, engineers, and labourers engaged in the complex task of raising the sunken fleet. First the relatively small destroyers were winched to the surface using pontoons and floating docks to be sold for scrap to help finance the operation, then the bigger battleships and battlecruisers were lifted, by sealing the multiple holes in the wrecks, and welding to the hulls long steel tubes which protruded above the water, for use as airlocks. In this fashion the submerged hulls were made into air-tight chambers and raised with compressed air, still inverted, back to the surface.

Cox endured bad luck and frequent fierce storms which often ruined his work, swamping and re-sinking ships which had just been raised. At one stage, during the General Strike of 1926, the salvage operation was about to grind to a halt due to a lack of coal to feed the many boilers for the water pumps and generators. Cox ordered that the abundant fuel bunkers of the sunken (but only partly submerged) battlecruiser be broken into to extract the coal with mechanical grabs, allowing work to continue.

Although he ultimately lost money on the contract, Cox kept going, employing new technology and methods as conditions dictated. By 1939, Cox and Metal Industries Ltd. (the company that he had sold out to in 1932) had successfully raised 45 of the 52 scuttled ships. The last, the massive , was raised from a record depth of 45 metres just before work was suspended with the start of the Second World War, before being towed to Rosyth where it was broken up in 1946.

A Morse key recovered from the battleship &quot;Grosser Kurfürst&quot; during the salvage is displayed at a Fife museum.

=== Second World War ===

Primarily because of its great distance from German airfields, Scapa Flow was again selected as the main British naval base during the Second World War.

The strong defences built during the First World War had fallen into disrepair. Defence against air attack was inadequate and blockships sunk to stop U-boats from penetrating had largely collapsed. While there were anti-submarine nets in place over the three main entrances, they were made only of single-stranded looped wire; there was also a severe lack of the patrolling destroyers and other anti-submarine craft that had previously been available. Efforts began belatedly to repair peacetime neglect, but were not completed in time to prevent a successful penetration by enemy forces.

On 14 October 1939, under the command of Günther Prien, penetrated Scapa Flow and sank the First World War-era battleship anchored in Scapa Bay. After firing its first torpedo salvo, the submarine turned to make its escape; but, upon realising that there was no immediate threat from surface vessels, it returned for another attack. The second torpedo salvo blew a hole in the &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, which flooded and quickly capsized. Of the 1,400-man crew, 833 were lost. The wreck is now a protected war grave. John Gunther in December 1939 called the attack &quot;the single most extraordinary feat of the war so far&quot;.

Three days after the submarine attack, four Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 bombers of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 1/30 led by group commander Hauptmann Fritz Doench raided Scapa Flow on 17 October in one of the first bombing attacks on Britain during the war. The attack badly damaged an old base ship, the decommissioned battleship , which was then beached at Ore Bay by a tug. One man died and 25 were injured. One of the bombers was shot down by No 1 gun of 226 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery on Hoy. Three of the crew died, while the radio operator Fritz Ambrosius was badly burned but managed to parachute down.

New blockships were sunk, booms and mines were placed over the main entrances, coast defence and anti-aircraft batteries were installed at crucial points, and Winston Churchill ordered the construction of a series of causeways to block the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow; they were built by Italian prisoners of war held in Orkney, who also built the Italian Chapel. These &quot;Churchill Barriers&quot; now provide road access from Mainland to Burray and South Ronaldsay, but block maritime traffic. An airfield, RAF Grimsetter (which later became HMS &quot;Robin&quot;), was built and commissioned in 1940.

===Use by the petroleum industry===
Scapa Flow is one of the transfer and processing points for North Sea oil. An underwater pipeline with a diameter of and a length of transports oil from the Piper oilfield to the Flotta oil terminal. The Claymore and Tartan oil fields also feed into this line.

=== Scapa Flow Visitor Centre ===
The Scapa Flow Visitor Centre is at Lyness on Hoy (from &quot;Háey&quot; meaning high island) the second largest of Orkney. Morning to evening ferries run from Houton on the Mainland.

The Visitor Centre occupies a converted naval fuel pumping station and storage tank and next to it is a round stone-built battery emplacement and artillery gun as well as other decommissioned arsenal. It features a large model of the island, Scapa Flow and of the German warships.

Scapa distillery, a Scotch whisky distillery is located on the shore.

==Scuba diving==
The wreckage of the remaining seven ships of the German fleet (and some other sites such as the blockships) has become increasingly popular as a venue for recreational scuba divers, and is regularly listed in dive magazines and internet forums among the top dive sites in the UK, Europe, and even the world. Although other locations, for example the Pacific regions, offer warmer water and better visibility, there are very few other sites which can offer such an abundance of large, historic wrecks lying in close proximity and shallow, relatively benign diving conditions. As of 2010, at least twelve &quot;live aboard&quot; boats—mostly converted trawlers with bunk rooms in their former holds—take recreational divers out to the main sites, primarily from the main harbour at Stromness. Diving provides a substantial amount of trade and income for the local economy.

Divers must first obtain a permit from the Island Harbour Authorities, which is available through diving shops and centres. The wrecks are mostly located at depths of 35 to 50 metres. Divers are permitted to enter the wrecks, but not to retrieve artefacts located within 100 metres of any wreck. However, time and tide has washed broken pieces of ships&#x27; pottery and glass bottles into shallow waters and onto beaches. The underwater visibility, which can vary between 2 and 20 metres, is not sufficient to view all the length of most wrecks at once; however, current technology is now allowing 3D images of them to be seen.

The important wrecks are:

===German battleships===

The three sister battleships of the : , and formed the main component of the 3rd Battleship Squadron which took part in fierce fighting at the Battle of Jutland far off the coast of Jutland, Denmark (31 May to 1 June 1916) and their upturned hulls are around 25 m deep. Never raised, they have been salvaged incrementally: armour plate blasted away and non-ferrous metals removed. Some of this material may have been obtained for specialized uses because it was not subject to the radiation put into the atmosphere by nuclear weapons, which were exploded in the open air from 1945 to 1963. Thus it was not made more radioactive by nuclear fallout. They also form highly rated dive sites chiefly due to their depth.

===German light cruisers===

The light cruisers , , and have modest fighting tops, lie side-on with around 16–20 metres of water above, are more accessible for divers and save for the shallowest, &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;, are less salvaged (stripped of valuable materials) than the battleships.

===Other vessels===

Additional sites of interest include the destroyer , which was raised and used by Cox as a working boat during his salvage operations, particularly on , then later abandoned; the Churchill blockships, such as the &quot;Tabarka&quot;, the &quot;Gobernador Bories&quot;, and the &quot;Doyle&quot; in Burra Sound; the U-boat ; and the trawler &quot;James Barrie&quot;. Also, some large items from many of the ship hulls that &quot;were&quot; raised (such as the main gun turrets, which fell away from the ships as they capsized) were never salvaged, and still rest on the seabed in close proximity to the impact craters gouged by the scuttled ships.

===War grave wrecks===

The wrecks of the battleships and (the latter of which exploded at anchor during the First World War) are war graves designated as Controlled Sites under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986—only divers of the British armed forces may visit these wrecks.

==Curse==

According to legend, a curse was placed on Scapa long ago by a witch. She buried a thimble in the sand at Nether Scapa, and until it was found no more whales would be caught in the area.

<text>Oran () is a major coastal city located in the northwest of Algeria. It is considered the second most important city of Algeria, after the capital, Algiers, because of its population and commercial, industrial and cultural importance. It is west-southwest from Algiers. The total population of the city was 803,329 in 2008, while the metropolitan area has a population of approximately 1,500,000, making it the second-largest city in Algeria.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Wahran&quot; comes from the Berber expression &quot;wa - iharan&quot; (place of lions). A locally popular legend tells that in the period around AD 900, there were sightings of Barbary lions in the area. The last two lions were killed on a mountain near Oran, and it became known as &quot;la montagne des lions&quot; (&quot;The Mountain of Lions&quot;). Two giant lion statues stand in front of Oran&#x27;s city hall, symbolizing the city.

==History==
===Overview===
During the Roman Empire, a small settlement called &quot;Unica Colonia&quot; existed in the area of the current Oran, but this settlement disappeared as the Maghreb was conquered by a succession of regional powers, beginning with the Vandals in 435, followed by the Berbers of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, and finally the Arabs around the start of the 8th century.

Present-day Oran was founded in 903 by the and Ajissa Berbers of the Maghrawa confederation who lived in the area. The city enjoyed a period of prosperity under the Almohad Caliph Abd al-Mu&#x27;min for a lengthy period of time when he built thirty vessels to connect it with Andalusia. It endured a long, prosperous reign under the zayyanid of Tlemcen and used its ports as a key outlet to Spain in particular. It was captured by the Castilians under Cardinal Cisneros in 1509, and Spanish sovereignty lasted until 1708 when the city was conquered by the Algerians during the siege of Siege of Oran (1707–1708). Spain recaptured the city in 1732. However, its value as a trading post had decreased greatly, so during the reign of King Charles IV the city was recaptured in 1790–1792 by a coalition of Algerian troops against Spain which resulted in victory for the bey of Oran despite the many attempts in 1563. The beylik lasted until 1831 when the city fell to the French.

Under French rule during the 19th and 20th centuries, Oran was the capital of the Département of Oran (number 92). In July 1940, the British navy shelled French warships in the port after they refused a British ultimatum to surrender; this action was taken to ensure the fleet would not fall into German hands, as the Nazis had defeated France and occupied Paris. The action increased the hatred of the Vichy regime for Britain but convinced the world that the British would fight alone against Nazi Germany and its allies. The Vichy government held Oran during World War II until its capture by the Allies in late 1942, during Operation Torch.

Also, during French rule, Jews were encouraged to modernize and take on jobs they had not before, including agriculture, while Muslims were forced out of the city and their ancestral fertile lands were confiscated and given to Colons. Jews in the city were allowed to join the French Army starting 24 October 1870, while Muslims were forced to do military service. Algerian Jews were granted citizenship while Algerian Muslims were not. Jews would soon be targeted after the war for not supporting the struggle for independence against France.

Before the Algerian War of 1954–1962, Oran had one of the highest proportions of Europeans of any city in North Africa. In July 1962, after a ceasefire and accords with France, the FLN entered Oran and were shot at by Europeans. A mob attacked pied-noir neighborhoods in response to the incident and during the subsequent Oran massacre of 1962 at least 95 and as many as 365 were killed; many others are reported to have &quot;disappeared&quot;. This triggered a larger exodus of Europeans to France, which was already underway. In 1962, most of the Europeans and Algerian Jews living in Oran were repatriated to France..

=== Religious history ===
==== Jewish presence in Oran ====

With its location as the closest port to Spain and its prominence on the Mediterranean, Jewish refugees first immigrated to Oran to flee persecution and conversion to Christianity in Spain in 1391. This refuge brought other religious refugees that included both Jews again and Muslims in both 1492 and 1502.

===Islamic dynasties (910–1509)===
===Spanish period (1509–1708, 1732–1792)===

Before the Spaniards, the Portuguese launched a failed expedition to capture the city in July 1501. Four years later, the Spanish took Mers-el-Kébir, located just west of Oran. Thus began the first organized incursions against the city which, at the time, numbered 25,000 inhabitants and counted 6,000 &quot;fueros&quot;. Count Pedro Navarro, on the orders of Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, finally captured the city on 17 May 1509. The occupying forces set fire to the books and archives of the town.

By 1554, the Turks had reached Algiers. The governor of Oran, Count Alcaudete, allied himself with Moroccan Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh against them. Nine years later, in 1563, Álvaro de Bazán, Marquis de Santa Cruz, built the fort of Santa-Cruz, strategically placed at the top of a mountain, l&#x27;Aïdour, more than above the sea, directly to the west of the city. Pedro Garcerán de Borja, Grand Master of the Order of Montesa, was captain of Oran when, on 14 July 1568, John of Austria (the illegitimate son of Charles I and paternal half-brother of King Philip II), led a flotilla of 33 galleys against the Algerians.

In April 1669 the Spanish governor, the 6th Marquess of Los Vélez, expelled all the Jews who lived in Oran and Mers El Kébir sending them to be resettled in either Nice, or Livorno.

The Spanish rebuilt Santa Cruz Fort to accommodate their city governors. &quot;The fortifications of the place were composed of thick and continuous walls of over two and a half km in circumference, surmounted by strong towers spaced between them,&quot; with a central castle or &quot;kasbah&quot; where the Spanish governor had his headquarters. Under Spanish rule, the city continued to grow, requiring enlargement of the city walls. In spite of the improved fortifications, the city was the object of repeated attacks. Notable in this regard, Moroccan Sharif Moulay Ismail tried to force his way past the defences in 1707, only to see his army decimated. In 1739, trade with the surroundings was forbidden for years due to the plague. In 1744, king Philip V asked the governor Tomás du Rollet de la tour for dromedaries to replenish the stock at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. However, the former bey of Oran had banned trade with the Spaniards and those dromedaries gradually sent to the king had been sold by thieving tribesmen. Most of the maintenance of the place was paid by the bull of the Crusade, a contribution of the Spanish Catholic church.

===Beylikal period (1708–1732, 1792–1831)===
The Spanish occupied the city until 1708, when the Bey of Mascara, Mustapha Ben Youssef (&quot;Bouchelaghem&quot;), vassal of the Deylik of Algiers, and who was an Arabized Berber from the Mascara region took advantage of the War of Spanish Succession to drive the Spanish out.

In 1732, Spanish forces returned under José Carrillo de Albornoz, capturing the city from Bouchelaghem. Spain maintained its hold over Oran for the next six decades.

In the night after 8 October 1790, a violent earthquake claimed more than 3,000 victims in less than seven minutes. Charles IV saw no advantage in continuing the occupation of the city, which had become increasingly expensive and perilous. He initiated discussions with the Dey of Algiers.

==== Siege of Oran and Mers el-Kébir (1790–1792) ====

After another earthquake damaged the Spanish defences, the forces of the new Bey of Oran, Mohammed el Kebir besieged the city. By the end of 1790, there was a clear Algerian advantage. The Spanish, not wanting to risk their troops, signed an agreement with the Algerians on 12 September in Algiers, and on 12 December in Madrid, which recognized Algerian control over the city. By February all Spanish troops evacuated. The capital was moved there the same year. In 1792, the Bey settled a Jewish community there. In 1796, the Pasha Mosque (in honour of Hassan Pasha, Beylerbey of Algiers) was built by the Bey with ransom money paid for the release of Spanish prisoners after Spain&#x27;s final departure.

===French period (1831–1962)===

The town of 10,000 inhabitants was still in the possession of the Ottoman Empire when a squadron under the command of captain Bourmand seized el-Kébir on 14 December 1830. The city was in a wretched state. On 4 January 1831, the French commanded by General Damrémont occupied Oran. In September 1831, General Berthezène appointed Mr. Pujol as mayor of Oran; he had been captain of cavalry in retirement and was wounded in the right hand under the Empire.

In 1832, leading a force of five thousand men, the young Emir Abd al-Qadir attacked Oran. In April 1833, commander-in-chief, General Boyer, was replaced by the baron Louis Alexis Desmichels. The city&#x27;s defenders, under attack by Abd al Qadir, held their ground. Many Europeans settled in Oran during the French period, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city&#x27;s population.

In World War II, Oran was one of the landing points in Operation Torch, the first American action in the Europe-North Africa theatre in November 1942. The Task Force suffered some damage to its fleet, trying to land in shallow water, but the enemy ships were sunk or driven off, and Oran surrendered after heavy fire from British battleships.

===Since independence (1962)===
Due to the exodus of Pieds-Noirs, the Cathédrale du Sacré-Cœur d&#x27;Oran was converted into a public library, Aubert Library of Oran, in 1984.

Today, Oran is a major port and a commercial centre, and has three universities. The old quarter of Oran has a casbah and an 18th-century mosque. The modern section of Oran is referred to as La Ville Nouvelle and was built after 1831; this section contrasts with the older section, La Blanca.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Oran features a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;). Oran&#x27;s climate does show influences of a Mediterranean climate; however, the combination of the city&#x27;s relatively high average annual temperature and relatively low annual precipitation precludes it from falling under that climate category. Oran averages of precipitation annually, the bulk of which falls between November and May. Summers are the warmest times of the year, with average high temperatures in the warmest month (August) approaching 32 degrees Celsius. Winters are the coolest times of the year in Oran, with high temperatures in the coolest month (January) at around 17 degrees Celsius.

== Earthquakes ==
As Oran is located in Northern Algeria, it faces the threat of earthquakes that can cause damage. However, the last major earthquake was in 1790; 3,000 people died as a result. Many of the existing older buildings in the city have been reinforced, and newer construction is designed to withstand earthquakes. While the city dates back to the 900s, rare are the still existing housing buildings older than the French occupation.

==Culture==
The folk music Raï (&quot;opinion&quot; in Arabic), had its beginnings in Oran. This genre of music was formulated by shepherds in the 1930s through Arab and European influences. This music was surrounded by controversy due to women&#x27;s key role in public performances of the music, as well as the hedonistic lyrics about love and alcohol. This led to strict governmental control in the area which led to arrests, injuries, and assassinations. Many notable Raï musicians (including Cheb Hasni, Cheb Khaled, and Rachid Taha) hail from Oran. The violinist Akim el Sikameya was also born in Oran. One of Oran&#x27;s most famous emigrants is Yves Saint Laurent.

Water supply in Oran has historically been stressed because of the lack of consistent rainfall. The regional government invested in hydraulic projects in the 2010s to increase retention of water, and installing a desalination plant increased water security. Oran&#x27;s region uses a mix of groundwater (11%), surface water (51%) and desalinization (38%).

<text>In quantum physics, a wave function (or wavefunction) is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system. The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters and (lower-case and capital psi, respectively). Wave functions are complex-valued. For example, a wave function might assign a complex number to each point in a region of space. The Born rule provides the means to turn these complex probability amplitudes into actual probabilities. In one common form, it says that the squared modulus of a wave function that depends upon position is the probability density of measuring a particle as being at a given place. The integral of a wavefunction&#x27;s squared modulus over all the system&#x27;s degrees of freedom must be equal to 1, a condition called &quot;normalization&quot;. Since the wave function is complex-valued, only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured; its value does not, in isolation, tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables. One has to apply quantum operators, whose eigenvalues correspond to sets of possible results of measurements, to the wave function and calculate the statistical distributions for measurable quantities.

Wave functions can be functions of variables other than position, such as momentum. The information represented by a wave function that is dependent upon position can be converted into a wave function dependent upon momentum and vice versa, by means of a Fourier transform. Some particles, like electrons and photons, have nonzero spin, and the wave function for such particles includes spin as an intrinsic, discrete degree of freedom; other discrete variables can also be included, such as isospin. When a system has internal degrees of freedom, the wave function at each point in the continuous degrees of freedom (e.g., a point in space) assigns a complex number for &quot;each&quot; possible value of the discrete degrees of freedom (e.g., z-component of spin). These values are often displayed in a column matrix (e.g., a column vector for a non-relativistic electron with spin ).

According to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, wave functions can be added together and multiplied by complex numbers to form new wave functions and form a Hilbert space. The inner product of two wave functions is a measure of the overlap between the corresponding physical states and is used in the foundational probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, the Born rule, relating transition probabilities to inner products. The Schrödinger equation determines how wave functions evolve over time, and a wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves, such as water waves or waves on a string, because the Schrödinger equation is mathematically a type of wave equation. This explains the name &quot;wave function&quot;, and gives rise to wave–particle duality. However, the wave function in quantum mechanics describes a kind of physical phenomenon, as of 2023 still open to different interpretations, which fundamentally differs from that of classic mechanical waves.

==Historical background==
In 1900, Max Planck postulated the proportionality between the frequency formula_1 of a photon and its energy 
and in 1916 the corresponding relation between a photon&#x27;s momentum formula_2 and wavelength 
where formula_3 is the Planck constant. In 1923, De Broglie was the first to suggest that the relation now called the De Broglie relation, holds for &quot;massive&quot; particles, the chief clue being Lorentz invariance, and this can be viewed as the starting point for the modern development of quantum mechanics. The equations represent wave–particle duality for both massless and massive particles.

In the 1920s and 1930s, quantum mechanics was developed using calculus and linear algebra. Those who used the techniques of calculus included Louis de Broglie, Erwin Schrödinger, and others, developing &quot;wave mechanics&quot;. Those who applied the methods of linear algebra included Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and others, developing &quot;matrix mechanics&quot;. Schrödinger subsequently showed that the two approaches were equivalent.

In 1926, Schrödinger published the famous wave equation now named after him, the Schrödinger equation. This equation was based on classical conservation of energy using quantum operators and the de Broglie relations and the solutions of the equation are the wave functions for the quantum system. However, no one was clear on how to interpret it. At first, Schrödinger and others thought that wave functions represent particles that are spread out with most of the particle being where the wave function is large. This was shown to be incompatible with the elastic scattering of a wave packet (representing a particle) off a target; it spreads out in all directions.
While a scattered particle may scatter in any direction, it does not break up and take off in all directions. In 1926, Born provided the perspective of probability amplitude. This relates calculations of quantum mechanics directly to probabilistic experimental observations. It is accepted as part of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. There are many other interpretations of quantum mechanics. In 1927, Hartree and Fock made the first step in an attempt to solve the &quot;N&quot;-body wave function, and developed the &quot;self-consistency cycle&quot;: an iterative algorithm to approximate the solution. Now it is also known as the Hartree–Fock method. The Slater determinant and permanent (of a matrix) was part of the method, provided by John C. Slater.

Schrödinger did encounter an equation for the wave function that satisfied relativistic energy conservation &quot;before&quot; he published the non-relativistic one, but discarded it as it predicted negative probabilities and negative energies. In 1927, Klein, Gordon and Fock also found it, but incorporated the electromagnetic interaction and proved that it was Lorentz invariant. De Broglie also arrived at the same equation in 1928. This relativistic wave equation is now most commonly known as the Klein–Gordon equation.

In 1927, Pauli phenomenologically found a non-relativistic equation to describe spin-1/2 particles in electromagnetic fields, now called the Pauli equation. Pauli found the wave function was not described by a single complex function of space and time, but needed two complex numbers, which respectively correspond to the spin +1/2 and −1/2 states of the fermion. Soon after in 1928, Dirac found an equation from the first successful unification of special relativity and quantum mechanics applied to the electron, now called the Dirac equation. In this, the wave function is a &quot;spinor&quot; represented by four complex-valued components: two for the electron and two for the electron&#x27;s antiparticle, the positron. In the non-relativistic limit, the Dirac wave function resembles the Pauli wave function for the electron. Later, other relativistic wave equations were found.

===Wave functions and wave equations in modern theories===
All these wave equations are of enduring importance. The Schrödinger equation and the Pauli equation are under many circumstances excellent approximations of the relativistic variants. They are considerably easier to solve in practical problems than the relativistic counterparts.

The Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation, while being relativistic, do not represent full reconciliation of quantum mechanics and special relativity. The branch of quantum mechanics where these equations are studied the same way as the Schrödinger equation, often called relativistic quantum mechanics, while very successful, has its limitations (see e.g. Lamb shift) and conceptual problems (see e.g. Dirac sea).

Relativity makes it inevitable that the number of particles in a system is not constant. For full reconciliation, quantum field theory is needed.
In this theory, the wave equations and the wave functions have their place, but in a somewhat different guise. The main objects of interest are not the wave functions, but rather operators, so called &quot;field operators&quot; (or just fields where &quot;operator&quot; is understood) on the Hilbert space of states (to be described next section). It turns out that the original relativistic wave equations and their solutions are still needed to build the Hilbert space. Moreover, the &quot;free fields operators&quot;, i.e. when interactions are assumed not to exist, turn out to (formally) satisfy the same equation as do the fields (wave functions) in many cases.

Thus the Klein–Gordon equation (spin ) and the Dirac equation (spin ) in this guise remain in the theory. Higher spin analogues include the Proca equation (spin ), Rarita–Schwinger equation (spin ), and, more generally, the Bargmann–Wigner equations. For &quot;massless&quot; free fields two examples are the free field Maxwell equation (spin ) and the free field Einstein equation (spin ) for the field operators.
All of them are essentially a direct consequence of the requirement of Lorentz invariance. Their solutions must transform under Lorentz transformation in a prescribed way, i.e. under a particular representation of the Lorentz group and that together with few other reasonable demands, e.g. the cluster decomposition property,
with implications for causality is enough to fix the equations.

This applies to free field equations; interactions are not included. If a Lagrangian density (including interactions) is available, then the Lagrangian formalism will yield an equation of motion at the classical level. This equation may be very complex and not amenable to solution. Any solution would refer to a &quot;fixed&quot; number of particles and would not account for the term &quot;interaction&quot; as referred to in these theories, which involves the creation and annihilation of particles and not external potentials as in ordinary &quot;first quantized&quot; quantum theory.

In string theory, the situation remains analogous. For instance, a wave function in momentum space has the role of Fourier expansion coefficient in a general state of a particle (string) with momentum that is not sharply defined.

== Definition (one spinless particle in one dimension) ==

For now, consider the simple case of a non-relativistic single particle, without spin, in one spatial dimension. More general cases are discussed below.

According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the state of a physical system, at fixed time formula_4, is given by the wave function belonging to a separable complex Hilbert space. As such, the inner product of two wave functions and can be defined as the complex number (at time )
:formula_5.

More details are given below. However, the inner product of a wave function with itself,
:formula_6,
is &quot;always&quot; a positive real number. The number (not ) is called the norm of the wave function .
The separable Hilbert space being considered is infinite-dimensional, which means there is no finite set of square integrable functions which can be added together in various combinations to create every possible square integrable function.

=== Position-space wave functions ===
The state of such a particle is completely described by its wave function, formula_7 where is position and is time. This is a complex-valued function of two real variables and .

For one spinless particle in one dimension, if the wave function is interpreted as a probability amplitude; the square modulus of the wave function, the positive real number
formula_8
is interpreted as the probability density for a measurement of the particle&#x27;s position at a given time . The asterisk indicates the complex conjugate. If the particle&#x27;s position is measured, its location cannot be determined from the wave function, but is described by a probability distribution.

====Normalization condition====
The probability that its position will be in the interval is the integral of the density over this interval:
formula_9
where is the time at which the particle was measured. This leads to the normalization condition:
formula_10
because if the particle is measured, there is 100% probability that it will be &quot;somewhere&quot;.

For a given system, the set of all possible normalizable wave functions (at any given time) forms an abstract mathematical vector space, meaning that it is possible to add together different wave functions, and multiply wave functions by complex numbers. Technically, wave functions form a ray in a projective Hilbert space rather than an ordinary vector space.

====Quantum states as vectors====
At a particular instant of time, all values of the wave function are components of a vector. There are uncountably infinitely many of them and integration is used in place of summation. In Bra–ket notation, this vector is written
formula_11
and is referred to as a &quot;quantum state vector&quot;, or simply &quot;quantum state&quot;. There are several advantages to understanding wave functions as representing elements of an abstract vector space:
* All the powerful tools of linear algebra can be used to manipulate and understand wave functions. For example:
** Linear algebra explains how a vector space can be given a basis, and then any vector in the vector space can be expressed in this basis. This explains the relationship between a wave function in position space and a wave function in momentum space and suggests that there are other possibilities too.
** Bra–ket notation can be used to manipulate wave functions.
* The idea that quantum states are vectors in an abstract vector space is completely general in all aspects of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, whereas the idea that quantum states are complex-valued &quot;wave&quot; functions of space is only true in certain situations.

The time parameter is often suppressed, and will be in the following. The coordinate is a continuous index. The are called &quot;improper vectors&quot; which, unlike &quot;proper vectors&quot; that are normalizable to unity, can only be normalized to a Dirac delta function.
formula_12
thus
formula_13
and
formula_14
which illuminates the identity operator
formula_15which is analogous to completeness relation of orthonormal basis in N-dimensional Hilbert space.

Finding the identity operator in a basis allows the abstract state to be expressed explicitly in a basis, and more (the inner product between two state vectors, and other operators for observables, can be expressed in the basis).

=== Momentum-space wave functions ===
The particle also has a wave function in momentum space:
formula_16
where is the momentum in one dimension, which can be any value from to , and is time.

Analogous to the position case, the inner product of two wave functions and can be defined as:
formula_17

One particular solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation is
formula_18
a plane wave, which can be used in the description of a particle with momentum exactly , since it is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator. These functions are not normalizable to unity (they are not square-integrable), so they are not really elements of physical Hilbert space. The set
formula_19
forms what is called the momentum basis. This &quot;basis&quot; is not a basis in the usual mathematical sense. For one thing, since the functions are not normalizable, they are instead normalized to a delta function,
formula_20

For another thing, though they are linearly independent, there are too many of them (they form an uncountable set) for a basis for physical Hilbert space. They can still be used to express all functions in it using Fourier transforms as described next.

=== Relations between position and momentum representations ===
The and representations are
formula_21

Now take the projection of the state onto eigenfunctions of momentum using the last expression in the two equations,
formula_22

Then utilizing the known expression for suitably normalized eigenstates of momentum in the position representation solutions of the free Schrödinger equation
formula_23
one obtains
formula_24

Likewise, using eigenfunctions of position,
formula_25

The position-space and momentum-space wave functions are thus found to be Fourier transforms of each other. They are two representations of the same state; containing the same information, and either one is sufficient to calculate any property of the particle.

In practice, the position-space wave function is used much more often than the momentum-space wave function. The potential entering the relevant equation (Schrödinger, Dirac, etc.) determines in which basis the description is easiest. For the harmonic oscillator, and enter symmetrically, so there it does not matter which description one uses. The same equation (modulo constants) results. From this, with a little bit of afterthought, it follows that solutions to the wave equation of the harmonic oscillator are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform in .

== Definitions (other cases) ==
Following are the general forms of the wave function for systems in higher dimensions and more particles, as well as including other degrees of freedom than position coordinates or momentum components.

=== Finite dimensional Hilbert space ===
While Hilbert spaces originally refer to infinite dimensional complete inner product spaces they, by definition, include finite dimensional complete inner product spaces as well.
In physics, they are often referred to as &quot;finite dimensional Hilbert spaces&quot;. For every finite dimensional Hilbert space there exist orthonormal basis kets that span the entire Hilbert space.

If the -dimensional set formula_26 is orthonormal, then the projection operator for the space spanned by these states is given by:

formula_27where the projection is equivalent to identity operator since formula_26 spans the entire Hilbert space, thus leaving any vector from Hilbert space unchanged. This is also known as completeness relation of finite dimensional Hilbert space.

The wavefunction is instead given by:

formula_29where formula_30, is a set of complex numbers which can be used to construct a wavefunction using the above formula.

==== Probability interpretation of inner product ====
If the set formula_26 are eigenkets of a non-degenerate observable with eigenvalues formula_32, by the postulates of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the observable to be formula_32 is given according to Born rule as:

formula_34

For non-degenerate formula_26 of some observable, if eigenvalues formula_36 have subset of eigenvectors labelled as formula_37, by the postulates of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the observable to be formula_36 is given by:

formula_39where formula_40 is a projection operator of states to subspace spanned by formula_37. The equality follows due to orthogonal nature of formula_26.

Hence, formula_30 which specify state of the quantum mechanical system, have magnitudes whose square gives the probability of measuring the respective formula_44 state.

==== Physical significance of relative phase ====
While the relative phase has observable effects in experiments, the global phase of the system is experimentally indistinguishable. For example in a particle in superposition of two states, the global phase of the particle cannot be distinguished by finding expectation value of observable or probabilities of observing different states but relative phases can affect the expectation values of observables.

While the overall phase of the system is considered to be arbitrary, the relative phase for each state formula_44 of a prepared state in superposition can be determined based on physical meaning of the prepared state and its symmetry. For example, the construction of spin states along x direction as a superposition of spin states along z direction, can done by applying appropriate rotation transformation on the spin along z states which provides appropriate phase of the states relative to each other.

==== Application to include spin ====
An example of finite dimensional Hilbert space can be constructed using spin eigenkets of formula_46-spin particles which forms a formula_47 dimensional Hilbert space. However, the general wavefunction of a particle that fully describes its state, is always from an infinite dimensional Hilbert space since it involves a tensor product with Hilbert space relating to the position or momentum of the particle. Nonetheless, the techniques developed for finite dimensional Hilbert space are useful since they can either be treated independently or treated in consideration of linearity of tensor product.

Since the spin operator for a given formula_46-spin particles can be represented as a finite formula_49 matrix which acts on formula_47 independent spin vector components, it is usually preferable to denote spin components using matrix/column/row notation as applicable.

For example, each is usually identified as a column vector:formula_51

but it is a common abuse of notation, because the kets are not synonymous or equal to the column vectors. Column vectors simply provide a convenient way to express the spin components.

Corresponding to the notation, the z-component spin operator can be written as:formula_52

since the eigenvectors of z-component spin operator are the above column vectors, with eigenvalues being the corresponding spin quantum numbers.

Corresponding to the notation, a vector from such a finite dimensional Hilbert space is hence represented as:

formula_53where formula_54 are corresponding complex numbers.

In the following discussion involving spin, the complete wavefunction is considered as tensor product of spin states from finite dimensional Hilbert spaces and the wavefunction which was previously developed. The basis for this Hilbert space are hence considered: formula_55.

=== One-particle states in 3d position space ===

The position-space wave function of a single particle without spin in three spatial dimensions is similar to the case of one spatial dimension above: formula_56 where is the position vector in three-dimensional space, and is time. As always is a complex-valued function of real variables. As a single vector in Dirac notation
formula_57

All the previous remarks on inner products, momentum space wave functions, Fourier transforms, and so on extend to higher dimensions.

For a particle with spin, ignoring the position degrees of freedom, the wave function is a function of spin only (time is a parameter);
formula_58
where is the spin projection quantum number along the axis. (The axis is an arbitrary choice; other axes can be used instead if the wave function is transformed appropriately, see below.) The parameter, unlike and , is a discrete variable. For example, for a spin-1/2 particle, can only be or , and not any other value. (In general, for spin , can be ). Inserting each quantum number gives a complex valued function of space and time, there are of them. These can be arranged into a column vector

formula_59

In bra–ket notation, these easily arrange into the components of a vector:
formula_60

The entire vector is a solution of the Schrödinger equation (with a suitable Hamiltonian), which unfolds to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations with solutions . The term &quot;spin function&quot; instead of &quot;wave function&quot; is used by some authors. This contrasts the solutions to position space wave functions, the position coordinates being continuous degrees of freedom, because then the Schrödinger equation does take the form of a wave equation.

More generally, for a particle in 3d with any spin, the wave function can be written in &quot;position–spin space&quot; as:
formula_61
and these can also be arranged into a column vector
formula_62
in which the spin dependence is placed in indexing the entries, and the wave function is a complex vector-valued function of space and time only.

All values of the wave function, not only for discrete but continuous variables also, collect into a single vector
formula_63

For a single particle, the tensor product of its position state vector and spin state vector gives the composite position-spin state vector
formula_64
with the identifications
formula_65
formula_66
formula_67

The tensor product factorization of energy eigenstates is always possible if the orbital and spin angular momenta of the particle are separable in the Hamiltonian operator underlying the system&#x27;s dynamics (in other words, the Hamiltonian can be split into the sum of orbital and spin terms). The time dependence can be placed in either factor, and time evolution of each can be studied separately. Under such Hamiltonians, any tensor product state evolves into another tensor product state, which essentially means any unentangled state remains unentangled under time evolution. This is said to happen when there is no physical interaction between the states of the tensor products. In the case of non separable Hamiltonians, energy eigenstates are said to be some linear combination of such states, which need not be factorizable; examples include a particle in a magnetic field, and spin–orbit coupling.

The preceding discussion is not limited to spin as a discrete variable, the total angular momentum &quot;J&quot; may also be used. Other discrete degrees of freedom, like isospin, can expressed similarly to the case of spin above.

===Many-particle states in 3d position space===
If there are many particles, in general there is only one wave function, not a separate wave function for each particle. The fact that &quot;one&quot; wave function describes &quot;many&quot; particles is what makes quantum entanglement and the EPR paradox possible. The position-space wave function for particles is written:
formula_68
where is the position of the -th particle in three-dimensional space, and is time. Altogether, this is a complex-valued function of real variables.

In quantum mechanics there is a fundamental distinction between &quot;identical particles&quot; and &quot;distinguishable&quot; particles. For example, any two electrons are identical and fundamentally indistinguishable from each other; the laws of physics make it impossible to &quot;stamp an identification number&quot; on a certain electron to keep track of it. This translates to a requirement on the wave function for a system of identical particles:
formula_69
where the sign occurs if the particles are &quot;all bosons&quot; and sign if they are &quot;all fermions&quot;. In other words, the wave function is either totally symmetric in the positions of bosons, or totally antisymmetric in the positions of fermions. The physical interchange of particles corresponds to mathematically switching arguments in the wave function. The antisymmetry feature of fermionic wave functions leads to the Pauli principle. Generally, bosonic and fermionic symmetry requirements are the manifestation of particle statistics and are present in other quantum state formalisms.

For &quot;distinguishable&quot; particles (no two being identical, i.e. no two having the same set of quantum numbers), there is no requirement for the wave function to be either symmetric or antisymmetric.

For a collection of particles, some identical with coordinates and others distinguishable (not identical with each other, and not identical to the aforementioned identical particles), the wave function is symmetric or antisymmetric in the identical particle coordinates only:
formula_70

Again, there is no symmetry requirement for the distinguishable particle coordinates .

The wave function for &quot;N&quot; particles each with spin is the complex-valued function
formula_71

Accumulating all these components into a single vector,

formula_72

For identical particles, symmetry requirements apply to both position and spin arguments of the wave function so it has the overall correct symmetry.

The formulae for the inner products are integrals over all coordinates or momenta and sums over all spin quantum numbers. For the general case of particles with spin in 3-d,
formula_73
this is altogether three-dimensional volume integrals and sums over the spins. The differential volume elements are also written &quot; or &quot;.

The multidimensional Fourier transforms of the position or position–spin space wave functions yields momentum or momentum–spin space wave functions.

====Probability interpretation====
For the general case of particles with spin in 3d, if is interpreted as a probability amplitude, the probability density is
formula_74

and the probability that particle 1 is in region with spin &quot;and&quot; particle 2 is in region with spin etc. at time is the integral of the probability density over these regions and evaluated at these spin numbers:

:formula_75

==== Physical significance of phase ====
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, it can be shown using Schrodinger&#x27;s time dependent wave equation that the equation:

formula_76is satisfied, where formula_77 is the probability density and formula_78, is known as the probability flux in accordance with the continuity equation form of the above equation.

Using the following expression for wavefunction:formula_79where formula_77 is the probability density and formula_81 is the phase of the wavefunction, it can be shown that:

formula_82

Hence the spacial variation of phase characterizes the probability flux.

In classical analogy, for formula_83, the quantity formula_84 is analogous with velocity. Note that this does not imply a literal interpretation of formula_84 as velocity since velocity and position cannot be simultaneously determined as per the uncertainty principle. Substituting the form of wavefunction in Schrodinger&#x27;s time dependent wave equation, and taking the classical limit, formula_86:

formula_87

Which is analogous to Hamilton-Jacobi equation from classical mechanics. This interpretation fits with Hamilton–Jacobi theory, in which formula_88, where &quot;&quot; is Hamilton&#x27;s principal function.

== Time dependence ==
For systems in time-independent potentials, the wave function can always be written as a function of the degrees of freedom multiplied by a time-dependent phase factor, the form of which is given by the Schrödinger equation. For particles, considering their positions only and suppressing other degrees of freedom,
formula_89
where is the energy eigenvalue of the system corresponding to the eigenstate . Wave functions of this form are called stationary states.

The time dependence of the quantum state and the operators can be placed according to unitary transformations on the operators and states. For any quantum state and operator , in the Schrödinger picture changes with time according to the Schrödinger equation while is constant. In the Heisenberg picture it is the other way round, is constant while evolves with time according to the Heisenberg equation of motion. The Dirac (or interaction) picture is intermediate, time dependence is places in both operators and states which evolve according to equations of motion. It is useful primarily in computing S-matrix elements.

==Non-relativistic examples==
The following are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for one non-relativistic spinless particle.

===Finite potential barrier===
One of the most prominent features of wave mechanics is the possibility for a particle to reach a location with a prohibitive (in classical mechanics) force potential. A common model is the &quot;potential barrier&quot;, the one-dimensional case has the potential
formula_90
and the steady-state solutions to the wave equation have the form (for some constants )
formula_91

Note that these wave functions are not normalized; see scattering theory for discussion.

The standard interpretation of this is as a stream of particles being fired at the step from the left (the direction of negative ): setting corresponds to firing particles singly; the terms containing and signify motion to the right, while and – to the left. Under this beam interpretation, put since no particles are coming from the right. By applying the continuity of wave functions and their derivatives at the boundaries, it is hence possible to determine the constants above.

In a semiconductor crystallite whose radius is smaller than the size of its exciton Bohr radius, the excitons are squeezed, leading to quantum confinement. The energy levels can then be modeled using the particle in a box model in which the energy of different states is dependent on the length of the box.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator===
The wave functions for the quantum harmonic oscillator can be expressed in terms of Hermite polynomials , they are
formula_92
where .

===Hydrogen atom===
The wave functions of an electron in a Hydrogen atom are expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and generalized Laguerre polynomials (these are defined differently by different authors—see main article on them and the hydrogen atom).

It is convenient to use spherical coordinates, and the wave function can be separated into functions of each coordinate,
formula_93
where are radial functions and are spherical harmonics of degree and order . This is the only atom for which the Schrödinger equation has been solved exactly. Multi-electron atoms require approximative methods. The family of solutions is:
formula_94
where
* the basis vectors of the chosen representation
* a differential volume element in the continuous degrees of freedom
* formula_95 a component of the vector formula_96, called the wave function of the system
* dimensionless discrete quantum numbers
* continuous variables (not necessarily dimensionless)

These quantum numbers index the components of the state vector. More, all are in an -dimensional set where each is the set of allowed values for ; all are in an -dimensional &quot;volume&quot; where and each is the set of allowed values for , a subset of the real numbers . For generality and are not necessarily equal.

Example:
The probability density of finding the system at time formula_4 at state is
formula_98

The probability of finding system with in some or all possible discrete-variable configurations, , and in some or all possible continuous-variable configurations, , is the sum and integral over the density,
formula_99

Since the sum of all probabilities must be 1, the normalization condition
formula_100
must hold at all times during the evolution of the system.

The normalization condition requires to be dimensionless, by dimensional analysis must have the same units as .

== Ontology ==
Whether the wave function exists in reality, and what it represents, are major questions in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Many famous physicists of a previous generation puzzled over this problem, such as Erwin Schrödinger, Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. Some advocate formulations or variants of the Copenhagen interpretation (e.g. Bohr, Eugene Wigner and John von Neumann) while others, such as John Archibald Wheeler or Edwin Thompson Jaynes, take the more classical approach and regard the wave function as representing information in the mind of the observer, i.e. a measure of our knowledge of reality. Some, including Schrödinger, David Bohm and Hugh Everett III and others, argued that the wave function must have an objective, physical existence. Einstein thought that a complete description of physical reality should refer directly to physical space and time, as distinct from the wave function, which refers to an abstract mathematical space.

<text>&quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; (German: &quot;Ein Hungerkünstler&quot;) is a short story by Franz Kafka first published in &quot;Die neue Rundschau&quot; in 1922. The story was also included in the collection &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; (&quot;Ein Hungerkünstler&quot;), the last book Kafka prepared for publication, which was printed by &quot;Verlag Die Schmiede&quot; shortly after his death. The protagonist, a hunger artist who experiences the decline in appreciation of his craft, is typically Kafkaesque: an individual marginalized and victimized by society at large. &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; explores themes such as death, art, isolation, asceticism, spiritual poverty, futility, personal failure and the corruption of human relationships. The title of the story has also been translated as &quot;A Fasting Artist&quot; and &quot;A Starvation Artist&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; is told retrospectively through third-person narration. The narrator looks back several decades from &quot;today&quot; to a time when the public marveled at the professional hunger artist and then depicts the waning interest in such displays. The story begins with a general description of &quot;the hunger artist&quot; before narrowing in on a single performer, the protagonist.

The hunger artist traveled around performing for curious spectators. He would sit in a cage empty of anything except for a clock and some straw, always attended by rotating teams of watchers selected by the public (usually three butchers) to ensure he was not secretly eating. Despite such precautions, many, including some of the watchers themselves, were convinced the hunger artist cheated. Such suspicions annoyed the hunger artist, as did the forty-day limit imposed on his fasting by his promoter, or &quot;impresario&quot;. The impresario insisted that, after forty days, public interest in the hunger artist inevitably declined, but the hunger artist found the time limit irksome and arbitrary, as it prevented him from bettering his own record and fasting indefinitely. At the end of a fast, the hunger artist, amid highly theatrical fanfare, would be carried from his cage and made to eat, both of which he always resented. These performances, followed by intervals of recuperation, were repeated for many years.

Despite his fame, the hunger artist felt dissatisfied and misunderstood. If a spectator, observing his apparent melancholy, tried to console him, he would erupt in fury, shaking the bars of his cage. The impresario would punish such outbursts by apologizing to the audience, pointing out that irritability was a consequence of fasting, and then trying to refute the hunger artist&#x27;s boast that he could fast much longer than he was allowed by showing photographs (which were also for sale) of the hunger artist near death at the end of a previous fast. In this way, the impresario suggested the hunger artist&#x27;s sadness and poor physique was caused by fasting, when, in the hunger artist&#x27;s view, he was depressed because of the premature cessation of his fasts. The impresario&#x27;s &quot;perversion of the truth&quot; further exasperated the hunger artist.

Seemingly overnight, popular tastes changed and public fasting went out of fashion. The hunger artist broke his ties with the impresario and hired himself to a circus, where he hoped to perform truly prodigious feats of fasting. No longer a main attraction, he was given a cage on the outskirts of the circus, near the animal cages. Although the site was readily accessible and crowds thronged past during intermissions in the circus show, few paid any attention to the hunger artist, partly because any spectators who stopped to look at him would create an obstruction in the flow of people on their way to see the animals. The hunger artist initially looked forward to the intermissions, but over time he came to dread them because they only meant there would be noise and disruption and a reminder that his days in the sun were gone. He felt oppressed by the sights, sounds, and smells of the animals, but he didn&#x27;t dare complain for fear of drawing attention to the fact that he was more of an annoyance than an attraction.

Eventually, the hunger artist came to be completely ignored by the public, so much so that no one, not even the artist himself, counted the days of his fast. One day, an overseer noticed what looked like an empty cage and wondered why it was unused. He and some attendants poked around in the dirty straw and found the hunger artist, near death. Before he died, he asked forgiveness and confessed that he should not be admired, since the reason he fasted was simply that he could not find food to his liking. The hunger artist was buried with the straw from his cage and replaced by a panther. Spectators crowded about the panther&#x27;s cage because the panther, who was always brought the food he liked, took so much joy in life.

==Themes==
There is a sharp division among critical interpretations of &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot;. Most commentators concur that the story is an allegory, but they disagree as to what is represented. Some critics, pointing to the hunger artist&#x27;s asceticism, regard him as a saintly or even Christ-like figure. In support of this view, they emphasize the unworldliness of the protagonist, the priest-like quality of the watchers, and the traditional religious significance of the forty-day period. Other critics insist that &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; is an allegory of the misunderstood artist, whose vision of transcendence and artistic excellence is rejected or ignored by the public. This interpretation is sometimes joined with a reading of the story as autobiographical. According to this view, this story, written near the end of Kafka&#x27;s life, links the hunger artist with the author as an alienated artist who is dying. Whether the protagonist&#x27;s starving is seen as spiritual or artistic, the panther is regarded as the hunger artist&#x27;s antithesis: satisfied and contented, the animal&#x27;s corporeality stands in marked contrast to the hunger artist&#x27;s ethereality.

Another interpretive division surrounds the issue of whether &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; is meant to be read ironically. Some critics consider the story a sympathetic depiction of a misunderstood artist who seeks to rise above the merely animal parts of human nature (represented by the panther) and who is confronted with uncomprehending audiences. Others regard it as Kafka&#x27;s ironic comment on artistic pretensions. The hunger artist comes to symbolize a joy-deprived man who shows no exuberance, who regards even his own tremendous discipline as inauthentic, and the panther who replaces him obviously is meant to show a sharp contrast between the two. Still, at least one interpretation is that Kafka is expressing the world&#x27;s indifference to his own artistic scruples through the plight of the hunger artist.

Critic Maud Ellmann argues that it is not by food that we survive, but by the gaze of others and &quot;it is impossible to live by hunger unless we can be seen or represent doing so&quot; (1993:17).

<text>Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (, 72.4% Fe), hematite (, 69.9% Fe), goethite (, 62.9% Fe), limonite (, 55% Fe), or siderite (, 48.2% Fe).

Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite (typically greater than about 60% iron) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, and can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces. Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel — 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel. In 2011 the &quot;Financial Times&quot; quoted Christopher LaFemina, mining analyst at Barclays Capital, saying that iron ore is &quot;more integral to the global economy than any other commodity, except perhaps oil&quot;.

== Sources ==

Elemental iron is virtually absent on the Earth&#x27;s surface except as iron-nickel alloys from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths. Although iron is the fourth most abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust, composing about 5% by weight, the vast majority is bound in silicate or, more rarely, carbonate minerals, and smelting pure iron from these minerals would require a prohibitive amount of energy. Therefore, all sources of iron used by human industry exploit comparatively rarer iron oxide minerals, primarily hematite.

Prehistoric societies used laterite as a source of iron ore. Prior to the industrial revolution, most iron was obtained from widely-available goethite or bog ore, for example, during the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Historically, much of the iron ore utilized by industrialized societies has been mined from predominantly hematite deposits with grades of around 70% Fe. These deposits are commonly referred to as &quot;direct shipping ores&quot; or &quot;natural ores&quot;. Increasing iron ore demand, coupled with the depletion of high-grade hematite ores in the United States, led after World War II to the development of lower-grade iron ore sources, principally the use of magnetite and taconite.

Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently, depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits. These are magnetite, titanomagnetite, hematite, and pisolitic ironstone deposits.

The origin of iron can be ultimately traced to its formation through nuclear fusion in stars, and most of the iron is thought to have originated in dying stars that are large enough to explode as supernovae. The Earth&#x27;s core is thought to consist mainly of iron, but this is inaccessible from the surface. Some iron meteorites are thought to have originated from asteroids in diameter or larger.

=== Banded iron formations ===

Banded iron formations (BIFs) are sedimentary rocks containing more than 15% iron composed predominantly of thinly-bedded iron minerals and silica (as quartz). Banded iron formations occur exclusively in Precambrian rocks, and are commonly weakly-to-intensely metamorphosed. Banded iron formations may contain iron in carbonates (siderite or ankerite) or silicates (minnesotaite, greenalite, or grunerite), but in those mined as iron ores, oxides (magnetite or hematite) are the principal iron mineral. Banded iron formations are known as &quot;taconite&quot; within North America.

The mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste. The waste comes in two forms: non-ore bedrock in the mine (overburden or interburden locally known as mullock), and unwanted minerals, which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself (gangue). The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps, and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings. Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz, which is chemically inert. This material is stored in large, regulated water settling ponds.

=== Magnetite ores ===
The key parameters for magnetite ore being economic are the crystallinity of the magnetite, the grade of the iron within the banded iron formation host rock, and the contaminant elements which exist within the magnetite concentrate. The size and strip ratio of most magnetite resources is irrelevant, as a banded iron formation can be hundreds of meters thick, extend hundreds of kilometers along strike, and can easily come to more than three billion or more tonnes of contained ore.

The typical grade of iron at which a magnetite-bearing banded iron formation becomes economic is roughly 25% iron, which can generally yield a 33% to 40% recovery of magnetite by weight, to produce a concentrate grading in excess of 64% iron by weight. The typical magnetite iron ore concentrate has less than 0.1% phosphorus, 3–7% silica, and less than 3% aluminium.

As of 2019, magnetite iron ore is mined in Minnesota and Michigan in the United States, eastern Canada, and northern Sweden. Magnetite-bearing banded iron formation is mined extensively in Brazil as of 2019, which exports significant quantities to Asia, and there is a nascent and large magnetite iron ore industry in Australia.

===Direct-shipping (hematite) ores===
Direct-shipping iron ore (DSO) deposits (typically composed of hematite) are currently exploited on all continents except Antarctica, with the largest intensity in South America, Australia, and Asia. Most large hematite iron ore deposits are sourced from altered banded iron formations and (rarely) igneous accumulations.

DSO deposits are typically rarer than the magnetite-bearing BIF or other rocks which form its main source, or protolith rock, but are considerably cheaper to mine and process as they require less beneficiation due to the higher iron content. However, DSO ores can contain significantly higher concentrations of penalty elements, typically being higher in phosphorus, water content (especially pisolite sedimentary accumulations), and aluminium (clays within pisolites). Export-grade DSO ores are generally in the 62–64% Fe range.

===Magmatic magnetite ore deposits===
Granite and ultrapotassic igneous rocks were sometimes used to segregate magnetite crystals and form masses of magnetite suitable for economic concentration. A few iron ore deposits, notably in Chile, are formed from volcanic flows containing significant accumulations of magnetite phenocrysts. Chilean magnetite iron ore deposits within the Atacama Desert have also formed alluvial accumulations of magnetite in streams leading from these volcanic formations.

Some magnetite skarn and hydrothermal deposits have been worked in the past as high-grade iron ore deposits requiring little beneficiation. There are several granite-associated deposits of this nature in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Other sources of magnetite iron ore include metamorphic accumulations of massive magnetite ore such as at Savage River, Tasmania, formed by shearing of ophiolite ultramafics.

Another, minor, source of iron ores are magmatic accumulations in layered intrusions which contain a typically titanium-bearing magnetite, often with vanadium. These ores form a niche market, with specialty smelters used to recover the iron, titanium, and vanadium. These ores are beneficiated essentially similarly to banded iron formation ores, but usually are more easily upgraded via crushing and screening. The typical titanomagnetite concentrate grades 57% Fe, 12% Ti, and 0.5% .

== Mine tailings ==
For every one ton of iron ore concentrate produced, approximately 2.5–3.0 tons of iron ore tailings will be discharged. Statistics show that there are 130 million tons of iron ore tailings discharged every year. If, for example, the mine tailings contain an average of approximately 11% iron, there would be approximately 1.41 million tons of iron wasted annually. These tailings are also high in other useful metals such as copper, nickel, and cobalt, and they can be used for road-building materials like pavement and filler and building materials such as cement, low-grade glass, and wall materials. While tailings are a relatively low-grade ore, they are also inexpensive to collect, as they do not have to be mined. Because of this, companies such as Magnetation have started reclamation projects where they use iron ore tailings as a source of metallic iron.

The two main methods of recycling iron from iron ore tailings are magnetizing roasting and direct reduction. Magnetizing roasting uses temperatures between for a time of under 1 hour to produce an iron concentrate (Fe3O4) to be used for iron smelting. For magnetizing roasting, it is important to have a reducing atmosphere to prevent oxidization and the formation of Fe2O3 because it is harder to separate as it is less magnetic. Direct reduction uses hotter temperatures of over and longer times of 2–5 hours. Direct reduction is used to produce sponge iron (Fe) to be used for steel-making. Direct reduction requires more energy, as the temperatures are higher and the time is longer and it requires more reducing agent than magnetizing roasting.

== Extraction ==
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines.

=== Magnetite ===
Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and capable of producing a high-grade concentrate with very low levels of impurities.

The grain size of the magnetite and its degree of commingling with the silica groundmass determine the grind size to which the rock must be comminuted to enable efficient magnetic separation to provide a high-purity magnetite concentrate. This determines the energy inputs required to run a milling operation.

Mining of banded iron formations involves coarse crushing and screening, followed by rough crushing and fine grinding to comminute the ore to the point where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.

Generally, most magnetite banded iron formation deposits must be ground to between in order to produce a low-silica magnetite concentrate. Magnetite concentrate grades are generally in excess of 70% iron by weight and usually are low in phosphorus, aluminium, titanium, and silica and demand a premium price.

===Hematite===
Due to the high density of hematite relative to associated silicate gangue, hematite beneficiation usually involves a combination of beneficiation techniques. One method relies on passing the finely-crushed ore over a slurry containing magnetite or other agent such as ferrosilicon which increases its density. When the density of the slurry is properly calibrated, the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.

== Production and consumption ==

Iron ore represents 93% of metals mined worldwide in 2021. Steel, of which iron is the key ingredient, represents almost 95% of all metal used per year. 

Iron-rich rocks are common worldwide, but ore-grade commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed in the table aside. The major constraint to economics for iron ore deposits is not necessarily the grade or size of the deposits, because it is not particularly hard to geologically prove enough tonnage of the rocks exist. The main constraint is the position of the iron ore relative to market, the cost of rail infrastructure to get it to market, and the energy cost required to do so.

Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals. It is highly capital intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail in order to transport the ore from the mine to a freight ship. For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands of a few major players.

World production averages of raw ore annually. The world&#x27;s largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation Vale, followed by Australian companies Rio Tinto Group and BHP. A further Australian supplier, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, has helped bring Australia&#x27;s production to first in the world.

The seaborne trade in iron ore—that is, iron ore to be shipped to other countries—was in 2004. Australia and Brazil dominate the seaborne trade, with 72% of the market. BHP, Rio and Vale control 66% of this market between them.

In Australia, iron ore is won from three main sources: pisolite &quot;channel iron deposit&quot; ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such as at Pannawonica, Western Australia; and the dominant metasomatically altered banded iron formation-related ores such as at Newman, the Chichester Range, the Hamersley Range and Koolyanobbing, Western Australia. Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently, such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps, for instance laterite iron ore deposits near Lake Argyle in Western Australia.

The total recoverable reserves of iron ore in India are about of hematite and of magnetite. Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Goa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu are the principal Indian producers of iron ore. World consumption of iron ore grows 10% per year on average with the main consumers being China, Japan, Korea, the United States, and the European Union.

China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore, which translates to be the world&#x27;s largest steel producing country. It is also the largest importer, buying 52% of the seaborne trade in iron ore in 2004. China is followed by Japan and Korea, which consume a significant amount of raw iron ore and metallurgical coal. In 2006, China produced of iron ore, with an annual growth of 38%.

===Iron ore market===

Over the last 40 years, iron ore prices have been decided in closed-door negotiations between the small handful of miners and steelmakers which dominate both spot and contract markets. Until 2006, prices were determined in annual benchmark negotiations between the main iron ore producers (BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Vale S.A.) and Japanese importers. In 2006, Chinese company Baosteel began handling negotiations for the importer side. The Chinese government replaced Baosteel with China Iron and Steel Association as lead negotiator in 2009. Traditionally, the first deal reached between these the major producers and the major importers sets a benchmark to be followed by the rest of the industry.

Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX) has launched the world&#x27;s first global iron ore futures contract, based on the Metal Bulletin Iron Ore Index (MBIOI) which uses daily price data from a broad spectrum of industry participants and independent Chinese steel consultancy and data provider Shanghai Steelhome&#x27;s widespread contact base of steel producers and iron ore traders across China. The futures contract has seen monthly volumes over after eight months of trading.

This move follows a switch to index-based quarterly pricing by the world&#x27;s three largest iron ore miners—Vale, Rio Tinto, and BHP—in early 2010, breaking a 40-year tradition of benchmark annual pricing.

==Abundance by country==
===Available world iron ore resources===
Iron is the most abundant element on earth but not in the crust. The extent of the accessible iron ore reserves is not known, though Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute suggested in 2006 that iron ore could run out within 64 years (that is, by 2070), based on 2% growth in demand per year.

===Australia===
Geoscience Australia calculates that the country&#x27;s &quot;economic demonstrated resources&quot; of iron currently amount to 24 gigatonnes, or . Another estimate places Australia&#x27;s reserves of iron ore at , or 30% of the world&#x27;s estimated , of which Western Australia accounts for . The current production rate from the Pilbara region of Western Australia is approximately per year and rising. Gavin Mudd (RMIT University) and Jonathon Law (CSIRO) expect it to be gone within 30–50 years and 56 years, respectively. These 2010 estimates require ongoing review to take into account shifting demand for lower-grade iron ore and improving mining and recovery techniques (allowing deeper mining below the groundwater table).

=== Brazil ===
Brazil is the second-largest producer of iron ore after Australia, accounting for 16% of the world&#x27;s iron ore production. After a somewhat sluggish production volume 2010-2020, partly due to the Mariana dam disaster in 2015 and the Brumadinho dam disaster in 2019, which halted the production at the two involved mines, production has increased steadily since 2021, when Brazil produced . In 2022 it increased to and in 2023 to .

The Brazilian production is expected to rise by a CAGR of 2% between 2023 and 2027, and industry analyst Fitch Solutions forecasted in 2021 that Brazil&#x27;s annual production will reach by 2030.

=== Canada ===
In 2017, Canadian iron ore mines produced of iron ore in concentrate pellets and 13.6 million tons of crude steel. Of the of steel was exported, and of iron ore was exported at a value of $4.6 billion. Of the iron ore exported, 38.5% of the volume was iron ore pellets with a value of $2.3 billion, and 61.5% was iron ore concentrates with a value of $2.3 billion. 46% of Canada&#x27;s iron ore comes from the Iron Ore Company of Canada mine, in Labrador City, Newfoundland, with secondary sources including the Mary River Mine in Nunavut.

=== India ===
According to the U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s 2021 Report on iron ore, India is estimated to produce of iron ore in 2020, placing it as the seventh-largest global center of iron ore production, behind Australia, Brazil, China, Russia, South Africa, and Ukraine.

India&#x27;s iron ore production in 2023 was 285,000,000 metric tonnes and was the fourth largest producer in the world.

===Ukraine===
According to the U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s 2021 report on iron ore, Ukraine is estimated to have produced of iron ore in 2020, placing it as the seventh largest global center of iron ore production, behind Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa. Producers of iron ore in Ukraine include Ferrexpo, Metinvest, and ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih.

=== United States ===
In 2014, mines in the United States produced of iron ore with an estimated value of $5.1 billion. Iron mining in the United States is estimated to have accounted for 2% of the world&#x27;s iron ore output. In the United States there are twelve iron ore mines, with nine being open pit mines and three being reclamation operations. There were also ten pelletizing plants, nine concentration plants, two direct-reduced iron (DRI) plants, and one iron nugget plant that were operating in 2014. In the United States the majority of iron ore mining is in the iron ranges around Lake Superior. These iron ranges occur in Minnesota and Michigan, which combined accounted for 93% of the usable iron ore produced in the United States in 2014. Seven of the nine operational open pit mines in the United States are located in Minnesota as well as two of the three tailings reclamation operations. The other two active open pit mines were located in Michigan. In 2016, one of the two mines shut down. There have also been iron ore mines in Utah and Alabama; however, the last iron ore mine in Utah shut down in 2014 and the last iron ore mine in Alabama shut down in 1975.

==Smelting==

Iron ores consist of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules. To convert it to metallic iron, it must be smelted or sent through a direct reduction process to remove the oxygen. Oxygen-iron bonds are strong, and to remove the iron from the oxygen, a stronger elemental bond must be presented to attach to the oxygen. Carbon is used because the strength of a carbon-oxygen bond is greater than that of the iron-oxygen bond at high temperatures. Thus, the iron ore must be powdered and mixed with coke, to be burnt in the smelting process.

Carbon monoxide is the primary ingredient of chemically stripping oxygen from iron. Thus, the iron and carbon smelting must be kept in an oxygen-deficient (reducing) state to promote the burning of carbon to produce and not .

* Air blast and charcoal (coke): 2 C + O2 → 2 CO
* Carbon monoxide (CO) is the principal reduction agent.
** Stage One: 3 Fe2O3 + CO → 2 Fe3O4 + CO2
** Stage Two: Fe3O4 + CO → 3 FeO + CO2
** Stage Three: FeO + CO → Fe + CO2
* Limestone calcining: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
* Lime acting as flux: CaO + SiO2 → CaSiO3

===Trace elements===
The inclusion of even small amounts of some elements can have profound effects on the behavioral characteristics of a batch of iron or the operation of a smelter. These effects can be both good and bad, some catastrophically bad. Some chemicals are deliberately added, such as flux, which makes a blast furnace more efficient. Others are added because they make the iron more fluid, harder, or give it some other desirable quality. The choice of ore, fuel, and flux determines how the slag behaves and the operational characteristics of the iron produced. Ideally, iron ore contains only iron and oxygen. In reality, this is rarely the case. Typically, iron ore contains a host of elements which are often unwanted in modern steel.

====Silicon====
Silica () is almost always present in iron ore. Most of it is slagged off during the smelting process. At temperatures above , some will be reduced and form an alloy with the iron. The hotter the furnace, the more silicon will be present in the iron. It is not uncommon to find up to 1.5% Si in European cast iron from the 16th to 18th centuries.

The major effect of silicon is to promote the formation of grey iron. Grey iron is less brittle and easier to finish than white iron. It is preferred for casting purposes for this reason. British metallurgist Thomas Turner reported that silicon also reduces shrinkage and the formation of blowholes, lowering the number of bad castings. However, too much silicon present in the iron leads to increased brittleness and moderate hardness.

====Phosphorus====
Phosphorus (P) has four major effects on iron: increased hardness and strength, lower solidus, increased fluidity, and cold shortness. Depending on the use intended for the iron, these effects are either good or bad. Bog ore often has a high phosphorus content.

The strength and hardness of iron increases with the concentration of phosphorus. 0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium-carbon steel. High-phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering. The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus. The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering. Modern steel makers can increase hardness by as much as 30%, without sacrificing shock resistance by maintaining phosphorus levels between 0.07 and 0.12%. It also increases the depth of hardening due to quenching, but at the same time also decreases the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures. This would decrease its usefulness in making blister steel (cementation), where the speed and amount of carbon absorption is the overriding consideration.

The addition of phosphorus has a downside. At concentrations higher than 0.2%, iron becomes increasingly cold short, or brittle at low temperatures. Cold short is especially important for bar iron. Although bar iron is usually worked hot, its uses often require it to be tough, bendable, and resistant to shock at room temperature. A nail that shatters when hit with a hammer or a carriage wheel that breaks when it hit a rock would not sell well. High enough concentrations of phosphorus render any iron unusable. The effects of cold shortness are magnified by temperature. Thus, a piece of iron that is perfectly serviceable in summer might become extremely brittle in winter. There is some evidence that during the Middle Ages the very wealthy may have had a high-phosphorus sword for summer and a low-phosphorus sword for winter.

Careful control of phosphorus can be of great benefit in casting operations. Phosphorus depresses the liquidus, allowing the iron to remain molten for longer and increasing fluidity. The addition of 1% can double the distance molten iron will flow. The maximum effect, about , is achieved at a concentration of 10.2%. For foundry work Turner felt the ideal iron had 0.2–0.55% phosphorus. The resulting iron filled molds with fewer voids and also shrank less. In the 19th century some producers of decorative cast iron used iron with up to 5% phosphorus. The extreme fluidity allowed them to make very complex and delicate castings, but they could not be weight-bearing, as they had no strength.

There are two remedies for high-phosphorus iron. The oldest, easiest, and cheapest, is avoidance. If the iron that the ore produced was cold short, one would search for a new source of iron ore. The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide. This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier. For instance, Isaac Zane, owner of Marlboro Iron Works, did not appear to know about it in 1772. Given Zane&#x27;s reputation for keeping abreast of the latest developments, the technique was probably unknown to the ironmasters of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Phosphorus is generally considered to be a deleterious contaminant because it makes steel brittle, even at concentrations of as little as 0.6%. When the Gilchrist–Thomas process allowed the removal of bulk amounts of the element from cast iron in the 1870s, it was a major development because most of the iron ores mined in continental Europe at the time were phosphorous. However, removing all the contaminant by fluxing or smelting is complicated, and so desirable iron ores must generally be low in phosphorus to begin with.

====Aluminium====
Small amounts of aluminium (Al) are present in many ores including iron ore, sand, and some limestones. The former can be removed by washing the ore prior to smelting. Until the introduction of brick-lined furnaces, the amount of aluminium contamination was small enough that it did not have an effect on either the iron or slag. However, when brick began to be used for hearths and the interior of blast furnaces, the amount of aluminium contamination increased dramatically. This was due to the erosion of the furnace lining by the liquid slag.

Aluminium is difficult to reduce. As a result, aluminium contamination of the iron is not a problem. However, it does increase the viscosity of the slag. This will have a number of adverse effects on furnace operation. The thicker slag will slow the descent of the charge, prolonging the process. High aluminium will also make it more difficult to tap off the liquid slag. At the extreme, this could lead to a frozen furnace.

There are a number of solutions to a high-aluminium slag. The first is avoidance; do not use ore or a lime source with a high aluminium content. Increasing the ratio of lime flux will decrease the viscosity.

====Sulfur====
Sulfur (S) is a frequent contaminant in coal. It is also present in small quantities in many ores, but can be removed by calcining. Sulfur dissolves readily in both liquid and solid iron at the temperatures present in iron smelting. The effects of even small amounts of sulfur are immediate and serious. They were one of the first worked out by iron makers. Sulfur causes iron to be red or hot short.

Hot short iron is brittle when hot. This was a serious problem as most iron used during the 17th and 18th centuries was bar or wrought iron. Wrought iron is shaped by repeated blows with a hammer while hot. A piece of hot short iron will crack if worked with a hammer. When a piece of hot iron or steel cracks, the exposed surface immediately oxidizes. This layer of oxide prevents the mending of the crack by welding. Large cracks cause the iron or steel to break up. Smaller cracks can cause the object to fail during use. The degree of hot shortness is in direct proportion to the amount of sulfur present. Today, iron with over 0.03% sulfur is avoided.

Hot short iron can be worked, but it must be worked at low temperatures. Working at lower temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman. The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result. A mildly sulfur-contaminated bar can be worked, but it requires a great deal more time and effort.

In cast iron, sulfur promotes the formation of white iron. As little as 0.5% can counteract the effects of slow cooling and a high silicon content. White cast iron is more brittle, but also harder. It is generally avoided, because it is difficult to work, except in China where high-sulfur cast iron, some as high as 0.57%, made with coal and coke, was used to make bells and chimes. According to , good foundry iron should have less than 0.15% sulfur. In the rest of the world, a high-sulfur cast iron can be used for making castings, but will make poor wrought iron.

There are a number of remedies for sulfur contamination. The first, and the one most used in historic and prehistoric operations, is avoidance. Coal was not used in Europe (unlike China) as a fuel for smelting because it contains sulfur and therefore causes hot short iron. If an ore resulted in hot short metal, ironmasters looked for another ore. When mineral coal was first used in European blast furnaces in 1709 (or perhaps earlier), it was coked. Only with the introduction of hot blast from 1829 was raw coal used.

====Ore roasting====
Sulfur can be removed from ores by roasting and washing. Roasting oxidizes sulfur to form sulfur dioxide (SO2), which either escapes into the atmosphere or can be washed out. In warm climates, it is possible to leave pyritic ore out in the rain. The combined action of rain, bacteria, and heat oxidize the sulfides to sulfuric acid and sulfates, which are water-soluble and leached out. However, historically (at least), iron sulfide (iron pyrite ), though a common iron mineral, has not been used as an ore for the production of iron metal. Natural weathering was also used in Sweden. The same process, at geological speed, results in the gossan limonite ores.

The importance attached to low-sulfur iron is demonstrated by the consistently higher prices paid for the iron of Sweden, Russia, and Spain from the 16th to 18th centuries. Today sulfur is no longer a problem. The modern remedy is the addition of manganese, but the operator must know how much sulfur is in the iron because at least five times as much manganese must be added to neutralize it. Some historic irons display manganese levels, but most are well below the level needed to neutralize sulfur.

Sulfide inclusion as manganese sulfide (MnS) can also be the cause of severe pitting corrosion problems in low-grade stainless steel such as AISI 304 steel. Under oxidizing conditions and in the presence of moisture, when sulfide oxidizes, it produces thiosulfate anions as intermediate species, and because the thiosulfate anion has a higher equivalent electromobility than the chloride anion due to its double negative electrical charge, it promotes pit growth. Indeed, the positive electrical charges born by Fe2+ cations released in solution by Fe oxidation on the anodic zone inside the pit must be quickly compensated / neutralized by negative charges brought by the electrokinetic migration of anions in the capillary pit. Some of the electrochemical processes occurring in a capillary pit are the same as those encountered in capillary electrophoresis. The higher the anion electrokinetic migration rate, the higher the rate of pitting corrosion. Electrokinetic transport of ions inside the pit can be the rate-limiting step in the pit growth rate.

<doc id="145358" wikidata="Q2528176" url="?curid=145358" title="Bilingual pun">
<text>A bilingual pun is a pun created by a word or phrase in one language sounding similar to a different word or phrase in another language. The result of a bilingual pun can be a joke that makes sense in more than one language (a joke that can be translated) or a joke which requires understanding of both languages (a joke specifically for those that are bilingual). A bilingual pun can be made with a word from another language that has the same meaning, or an opposite meaning.
==Description==
A bilingual pun involves a word from one language which has the same or similar meaning in another language&#x27;s word. The word is often homophonic whether on purpose or by accident. Another feature of the bilingual pun is that the person does not always need to have the ability to speak both languages in order to understand the pun. The bilingual pun can also demonstrate common ground with a person who speaks another language.

==Examples==
===Biblical===
There are what appear to be Biblical bilingual puns. In Exodus 10:10, Moses is warned by the Egyptian Pharaoh that evil awaits him. In Hebrew the word &quot;ra&quot; () means evil, but in Egyptian &quot;Ra&quot; is the sun god. So when Moses was warned the word &quot;ra&quot; can mean the sun god stands in the way, or evil stands in the way.

===Literature===
Unintentional bilingual puns occur in translations of one of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays: &quot;Henry V&quot;. The line spoken by Katherine, &quot;I cannot speak your England&quot; becomes political in French.

===Mathematics===
The famous paper “Fun with F1” is a French-English pun as 1 is un in French.

===Gaming===
Wario&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the name Mario and the Japanese word &quot;warui&quot; (), meaning &quot;bad&quot;, reflecting how he is a bad version of Mario. But in English, &quot;Wario&quot; can be seen as either a portmanteau of the name Mario and &quot;war&quot;, or as a flip of the M in &quot;Mario&quot;.

<text>Nyota Uhura (), or simply Uhura, is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In the original television series, the character was portrayed by Nichelle Nichols, who reprised the role for the first six &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature films. A younger Uhura is portrayed by Celia Rose Gooding in the 2022 prequel series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, while an alternate timeline version of Uhura has been portrayed by actress Zoe Saldaña in the feature films &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013), and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016).

Uhura is a polyglot, translator and communications officer who specializes in linguistics, cryptography, and philology. She was an important part of the original series&#x27; multicultural crew and one of the first black characters to be portrayed in a non-menial role on an American television series.

==Name==
Gene Roddenberry had intended his new female communications officer to be called &quot;Lieutenant Sulu&quot;. Herb Solow pointed out how similar this was to &quot;Zulu&quot; and thought it might act against the plan for racial diversity in the show, so the name Sulu remained with George Takei&#x27;s character. &quot;Uhura&quot; comes from the Swahili word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;freedom&quot;. Nichols states in her 1994 book &quot;Beyond Uhura&quot; that the name was inspired by Robert Ruark&#x27;s 1962 book &quot;Uhuru&quot;, which she had with her on the day she read for the part. When producer Robert Justman explained to Roddenberry what the word &quot;uhuru&quot; meant, he changed it to Uhura and adopted that as the character&#x27;s name. Coincidentally, the end credits of the film &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; incorrectly refer to Uhura as &quot;Uhuru&quot;.

Uhura&#x27;s first name was not used in &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon until Abrams&#x27;s 2009 film. The mystery regarding Uhura&#x27;s first name is the subject of a running joke in the film, as Captain Kirk repeatedly tries to find out what it is, before finally hearing Spock call her &quot;Nyota&quot; in a moment of intimacy.

Although other non-canon names had previously existed, &quot;Nyota&quot; had been the most common. Two other proposed names were &quot;Penda&quot; and &quot;Samara&quot;. The FASA produced &quot;Star Trek: The Role Playing Game&quot; (1982) gave Uhura&#x27;s first name as &quot;Samara&quot; while the fanzine collection &quot;The Best of Trek&quot; (18 volumes, 1978–1996) suggests that Uhura&#x27;s first name is &quot;Penda&quot;, coined when a group of fanzine authors suggested it to Nichols at an early convention.

Author William Rotsler created the name &quot;Nyota&quot; for his 1982 licensed tie-in book, &quot;Star Trek II Biographies&quot; published by Wanderer (Pocket) Books. Seeking approval for the name he contacted Gene Roddenberry and Nichelle Nichols. Roddenberry approved of the name. Nichols also approved and was very excited when Rotsler informed her that Nyota means &quot;star&quot; in Swahili. After originating in &quot;Star Trek II Biographies&quot; &quot;Nyota&quot; started appearing in &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, such as &quot;Uhura&#x27;s Song&quot; (1985) by Janet Kagan. While guest-starring on the game show &quot;Super Password&quot; on January 7, 1987, Nichols stated that Uhura&#x27;s first name was &quot;Nyota&quot;.

==Development==
Soon after the first scripts for &quot;Star Trek&quot; were being written, Roddenberry spoke of a new character, a female communications officer and introduced Herb Solow and Robert Justman to Nichols, who had worked for him on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;. Although &quot;The Cage&quot; (the first pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, featuring a female first officer, Number One) was rejected, Roddenberry continued to seek diversity in his casting for the series, including a greater emphasis on racial diversity, with Nichols as Uhura and George Takei as Sulu. Uhura&#x27;s role of &quot;answering the phone&quot; has been described as gender normative for the era.

Nichols planned to leave &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1967 after its first season, wanting to return to musical theater. She changed her mind after talking to Martin Luther King Jr. who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial harmony and cooperation. King told Nichols, &quot;You are our image of where we&#x27;re going, you&#x27;re 300 years from now, and that means that&#x27;s where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing, you are our inspiration.&quot; As Nichols recounted, &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you understand for the first time we&#x27;re seen as we should be seen. You don&#x27;t have a black role. You have an equal role.&#x27;

==Depiction==

Uhura, from the United States of Africa, speaks Swahili and was born on January 19, 2233. James Blish&#x27;s non-canon novels identify her as Bantu, as does Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;.

Uhura first appears in the episode &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, joining the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a lieutenant, and serves as chief communications officer under Captain Kirk. She is depicted as a capable bridge officer and readily assumed control of the helm, navigation and science stations on the bridge when the need arose. Uhura was also a talented singer, and enjoyed serenading her shipmates when off-duty; Spock occasionally accompanied her on the Vulcan lyre in episodes &quot;Charlie X&quot; and &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;.

In &quot;The Lorelei Signal&quot;, a 1973 episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, Uhura assumes command of the Enterprise when the male officers fall victim to a species of sirens and leads an all-female rescue party. After the sirens are defeated, the Enterprise crew help the sirens, and Uhura bonds with the sirens, who are happy at the thought that they might meet men and have children.

She is later promoted to lieutenant commander in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, and to full commander in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;.

&quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; sees Uhura take an assignment in the transporter room as part of a plot to steal the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. After locking a colleague in a closet, Uhura uses the transporter station to beam Kirk, Leonard McCoy and Hikaru Sulu to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; so they can use it to rescue Spock from the Genesis Planet. As planned, Uhura later meets up with her crewmates on Vulcan and witnesses Spock&#x27;s successful renewal.

Uhura has a smaller role in the first, second and third films. &quot;Uhura&#x27;s Song&quot;, a novel published in 1985, developed her character further, placing her at the center of the action and introducing Uhura&#x27;s interest in alien languages. Elements from this novel influenced her depiction in later films and novels.

Following these events and the destruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Uhura joins her crewmates on a stolen Klingon ship amid a crisis on Earth in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. Traveling to the 20th century, they attempt to save a pair of humpback whales in order to repopulate the species. During a trip to San Francisco, Uhura and Pavel Chekov infiltrate the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and use emissions from the carrier&#x27;s nuclear reactor to recharge the Klingon vessel&#x27;s power supply. Kirk and Spock then procure the whales so the crew can return to the 23rd century and save Earth.

In light of their heroics, Starfleet Command exonerates Uhura and the rest of Kirk&#x27;s crew for their illegal activities. Kirk is demoted to the rank of captain after a prior promotion to admiral, but is assigned to command the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A. Uhura joins Kirk&#x27;s crew, and once again serves as chief communications officer throughout the events of &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. In &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, a romantic interest between Uhura and Montgomery Scott is briefly implied while Uhura seemingly is under the influence of Sybok, but the subplot is never fully developed in the following movies, leading the viewer to assume that the pair continues as friends.

A hidden &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; season 2 Easter egg reveals Nichelle Nichols’ Uhura became a starship captain after &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;, where Cadet Jean-Luc Picard first experienced lightspeed travel.

===Reboot (Kelvin timeline) films===

In the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Zoe Saldana plays a young Uhura who is introduced as a cadet at the academy, but is promoted to a communications officer as the movie unfolds. The film is also notable for officially establishing the character&#x27;s given name, Nyota. This Uhura is initially cold towards Kirk (and is verbally more than a match for him) after he attempts to flirt with her while intoxicated. However, by the end of film, she comes to respect Kirk as captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Although Nichols was not consulted over the character&#x27;s casting, Saldana personally reached out to Nichols, who in turn helped her prepare for the role.

A former student of Spock&#x27;s, Uhura is also romantically involved with him. In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the ongoing comic book series by IDW Publishing, they are shown going on a date during her studies at the Academy. When Uhura is initially assigned to the USS &quot;Farragut&quot; in an attempt by Spock to avoid the appearance of favoritism, she demands that he assign her to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, arguing she would have been assigned there had they not been involved. She persists in her complaints until Spock relents. Had she remained on the &quot;Farragut&quot;, she would have been killed, as that vessel is subsequently destroyed by the villain Nero. Uhura quickly receives a field promotion due to her skill with the Romulan language and remains on the bridge for most of the film.

The 2009 depiction of Nyota Uhura generated much online debate, with some fans praising her portrayal, while other fans disapproved of her romantic relationship with Spock, or suggested that her expanded role in the film was evidence that she had become a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; character. Other fans suggested that a romance with Spock was hinted in &quot;TOS&quot;, but could not be followed up on due to racism at the time, and that it would have been impossible at the time to depict Uhura in a romantic relationship. When discussing her response to the 2009 film, Nichelle Nichols confirmed that &quot;there was always a connection between Uhura and Spock&quot; and that the times did not allow for anything more than &quot;hints&quot;. Nichols also discussed meeting with Saldana to discuss Uhura, and praised Saldana&#x27;s portrayal. One writer said the intersectionality of Uhura as a Black woman was important when discussing her romance with Spock, because romances between Black women and white men were largely portrayed as cautionary tales in Hollywood films.

In the first sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, Uhura has been serving on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for a year and is still romantically involved with Spock. She and Kirk have a good working relationship and share their frustrations with Spock&#x27;s emotional unavailability (Uhura as his lover, Kirk as his best friend). Uhura is called upon several times to act as a field officer, attempting to use her fluency in Klingon to assist in the hunt for the fugitive John Harrison. She later contacts Spock Prime (at her Spock&#x27;s request) to consult him over Harrison&#x27;s identity, and at the climax of the film, helps Spock defeat and capture Harrison after a long chase and fierce hand-to-hand combat. In the second sequel, &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, her exceptional hearing, first referenced in the 2009 film, reveals the identity of the main antagonist. Spock and Uhura amicably discuss ending their relationship and have some tension over Spock&#x27;s intention to leave Starfleet to help the Vulcan survivors, in the wake of the death of Spock Prime. Spock later instead chooses to remain in Starfleet, and begins to renew his relationship with Uhura.

In a 2012 poll conducted by &quot;SFX Magazine&quot; to find the 100 sexiest female characters in science fiction and fantasy, Uhura, as portrayed by Saldana in the 2009 film, was voted number one.

===&quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;===
In &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, the character is featured as a Cadet serving on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as part of an advanced placement. Played by Celia Rose Gooding. The series reveals Uhura&#x27;s backstory: she is from Kenya and her parents, both university professors, and older brother died when she was younger - possibly in an explosion or shuttle crash (STSNW Subspace Rhapsody). At a dinner in Captain Pike&#x27;s quarters, Uhura admits that she joined Starfleet as a way of honoring her grandmother who was a Starfleet officer that raised her when her parents died, but is unsure about continuing in the service. This draws negative reactions from other members of the crew, including Spock. However, after her exemplary performance on her first away mission, Spock softens his tone and tells her that she will make an excellent officer if she decides to stay.
Season 2 she returns to the Enterprise as an Ensign and the Enterprise&#x27;s communications officer.

==Cultural impact==
===Role model===
When Nichols considered quitting the show in the late 1960s, she was told someone wanted to meet her, claiming to be her biggest fan. By her account the fan was Martin Luther King Jr., who convinced her not to leave the show by stating: &quot;You cannot do that. ... For the first time, we are being seen the world over as we should be seen.&quot; Nichols decided to stay on the show, explaining her reasons to Roddenberry, who replied &quot;finally, someone gets it.&quot;

Whoopi Goldberg describes Uhura as an inspiration for her acting career and status as a Star Trek fan. Goldberg later recalled watching &quot;Star Trek&quot; as a teenager and telling family members: &quot;I just saw a Black woman on television; and she ain&#x27;t no maid!&quot; Goldberg later played Guinan on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

NASA employed Nichols in a campaign to encourage women and African-Americans to join the organization. In 1978 NASA Astronaut Group 8 yielded the first recruits composed of women and ethnic minorities in the United States. Three were Black (Guion Bluford, Ronald McNair and Dr. Frederick D. Gregory). Mae Jemison, the first Black woman to fly aboard the Space Shuttle, cited &quot;Star Trek&quot; as an influence in her decision to join. Jemison herself had a minor role on an episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; called &quot;Second Chances&quot;, playing a transporter operator named Lieutenant Palmer. Jemison was the first of several real-life astronauts to appear on &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

On February 29, 2012, Nichols met with President Obama in the White House Oval Office. She later Tweeted about the meeting, &quot;&quot;Months ago Pres Obama was quoted as saying that he&#x27;d had a crush on me when he was younger.&quot; Nichols also wrote, &quot;I asked about that &amp; he proudly confirmed it! President Obama also confirmed for me that he was definitely a Trekker! How wonderful is that?!&quot;

===Interracial kiss===

In the 1968 episode &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;, Uhura and Captain Kirk kiss. For many years this was claimed to be the first example of a scripted inter-racial kiss on United States television, although other examples have come to light. Originally, the scene was to be filmed both with the kiss, and without it so that the network could later decide to either air the kiss, or exclude it. However, Shatner and Nichols deliberately flubbed every take without the kiss, rendering them useless so that the kiss had to be included.

==Reception==
In 2013, Uhura was ranked among the top 50 sexiest characters of the science-fiction genre. They note the character is &quot;a whipsmart wise-ass who can hold her own against the guys&quot; of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

In 2016, Screen Rant rated Uhura as the 16th best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall as presented in television and film up to that time, highlighting the character as a &quot;lingual expert who could handle herself on away missions&quot;. In 2018, Comic Book Resources ranked Uhura as the 23rd best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed Uhura as 20th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2016, Uhura was ranked as the 14th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Uhura the second most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, in between Benjamin Sisko and Jean-Luc Picard.

In 2017, Comic Book Resources ranked the performance of Mirror Uhura the 14th &quot;fiercest&quot; female character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, Comic Book Resources ranked Uhura the 23rd best member of Starfleet.

<doc id="145366" wikidata="Q254038" url="?curid=145366" title="Nichelle Nichols">
<text>Nichelle Nichols ( ; born Grace Dell Nichols; December 28, 1932 – July 30, 2022) was an American actress, singer and dancer whose portrayal of Uhura in &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its film sequels was groundbreaking for African American actresses on American television. From 1977 to 2015, she volunteered her time to promote NASA&#x27;s programs and recruit diverse astronauts, including some of the first female and ethnic minority astronauts.

Born in the Chicago suburb of Robbins, she trained in dance, and began her career as a dancer, singer and model in Chicago. As an actor, she appeared on stage, in television and in film.

== Early life ==

Grace Dell &quot;Nichelle&quot; Nichols was born the third of six children on December 28, 1932, in Robbins, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, to Samuel Earl Nichols, a factory worker who was elected both town mayor of Robbins in 1929 and its chief magistrate, and his wife, Lishia (Parks) Nichols, a homemaker. Disliking her name, Nichols asked her parents for a new one; they suggested Nichelle, which they said meant &quot;victorious maiden&quot; (from Nike and the suffix ). The family later moved into an apartment in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago, where Nichols attended Englewood High School, graduating in 1951. From age 12, she studied dance at the Chicago Ballet Academy.

== Career ==
Nichols began her professional career as a singer and dancer in Chicago. She then toured the United States and Canada with the bands of Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton. In 1959, she appeared as the principal dancer in the film version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Her acting break was an appearance in &quot;Kicks and Co.&quot;, Oscar Brown&#x27;s highly touted but ill-fated 1961 musical. In the thinly veiled satire of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, she played Hazel Sharpe, a voluptuous campus queen who was tempted by the devil and &quot;Orgy Magazine&quot; to become &quot;Orgy Maiden of the Month&quot;. Although the play closed after a short run in Chicago, Nichols attracted the attention of Hugh Hefner, the publisher of &quot;Playboy&quot;, who booked her as a singer for his Chicago Playboy Club. She also appeared as Carmen for a Chicago stock company production of &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; and performed in a New York production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Between acting and singing engagements, she did occasional modeling.

In January 1967, Nichols was also featured on the cover of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine, and had two feature articles in it in five years. She continued touring the US, Canada, and Europe as a singer with Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton. On the West Coast, she appeared in &quot;The Roar of the Greasepaint&quot; and &quot;For My People&quot;, and garnered high praise for her performance in the James Baldwin play &quot;Blues for Mister Charlie&quot;. Prior to being cast as Lieutenant Uhura in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Nichols was a guest actress on television producer Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s first series &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; (1964) in the episode &quot;To Set It Right&quot;, which dealt with racial prejudice.

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===
On &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Nichols was one of the first Black women featured in a major television series. Her prominent supporting role as a bridge officer was unprecedented. She was once tempted to leave the series; however, a conversation with Martin Luther King Jr. changed her mind.

Towards the end of the first season, Nichols was offered a role on Broadway. Preferring the stage to the television studio, she decided to take the role. Nichols went to Roddenberry&#x27;s office, told him that she planned to leave, and handed him her resignation letter. Unable to convince her to stay, Roddenberry told her to take the weekend off, and if she still felt she should leave, he would give her his blessing. That weekend, Nichols attended a banquet organized by the NAACP, where she was informed that a fan wanted to meet her.

Calling Nichols a &quot;vital role model&quot;, King compared her work on the series to the marches of the ongoing civil rights movement. The next day, she returned to Roddenberry&#x27;s office to tell him she would stay. When she told Roddenberry what King had said, tears came to his eyes.

Former NASA astronaut Mae Jemison cited Nichols&#x27; role of Lieutenant Uhura as her inspiration for becoming an astronaut. Whoopi Goldberg has also spoken of Nichols&#x27; influence, saying she asked for a role on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and her character Guinan was specially created, while Jemison appeared on an episode of the series.

In her role as Lieutenant Uhura, Nichols kissed white actor William Shatner (as Captain James T. Kirk) in the November 22, 1968 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;. It has been cited as the first example of an interracial kiss on U.S. television, although several earlier instances have been identified. The Shatner/Nichols kiss was considered groundbreaking, even though it was portrayed as having been forced by alien telekinesis. There was some praise and almost no dissent. In her autobiography &quot;Beyond Uhura, Star Trek and Other Memories&quot;, Nichols cited a letter from a white Southerner who wrote, &quot;I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain&#x27;t gonna fight it.&quot; During the Comedy Central Roast of Shatner on August 20, 2006, Nichols jokingly referred to the kiss and said, &quot;What do you say, let&#x27;s make a little more TV history ... &quot;and kiss my black ass!&quot;&quot;

Despite the series&#x27; cancellation in 1969, &quot;Star Trek&quot; continued to play a part in Nichols&#x27; life. She provided the voice of Uhura in &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;; in one episode, &quot;The Lorelei Signal&quot;, Uhura assumes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Nichols noted in her autobiography her frustration that this never happened on the original series. She co-starred in six &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, culminating in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. 
In 1994, Nichols published her autobiography, &quot;Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories&quot;. In it, she claimed that the role of Peggy Fair in the television series &quot;Mannix&quot; was offered to her during the final season of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but producer Gene Roddenberry refused to release her from her contract. Between the end of the original series and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; animated series and feature films, Nichols appeared in small television and film roles. She briefly appeared as a secretary in &quot;Doctor, You&#x27;ve Got to Be Kidding!&quot; (1967), and portrayed Dorienda, a foul-mouthed madam in &quot;Truck Turner&quot; (1974) opposite Isaac Hayes, her only appearance in a blaxploitation film.

Nichols appeared in animated form as one of Al Gore&#x27;s Vice Presidential Action Rangers in the &quot;Anthology of Interest I&quot; episode of &quot;Futurama&quot;, and she provided the voice of her own head in a glass jar in the episode &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;. She voiced the recurring role of Elisa Maza&#x27;s mother Diane Maza in the animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, and played Thoth-Kopeira in an episode of &quot;&quot;. In 2004, she provided the voice for herself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Simple Simpson&quot;. In the comedy film &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; (2002), she appeared as the mother of the male lead, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. In 2006, she played the title character in the film &quot;Lady Magdalene&#x27;s&quot;, the madam of a legal Nevada brothel in tax default. She also served as executive producer and choreographer, and sang three songs in the film, two of which she composed. She was twice nominated for the Chicago theatrical Sarah Siddons Award for Best Actress, first for her portrayal of Hazel Sharpe in &quot;Kicks and Co.,&quot; and again for her performance in &quot;The Blacks&quot;.

Nichols had a recurring role on the second season of the NBC drama &quot;Heroes,&quot; first in the episode &quot;Kindred&quot;, which aired October 8, 2007. She portrayed Nana Dawson, the matriarch of a New Orleans family financially and personally devastated by Hurricane Katrina, who cares for her orphaned grandchildren and her great-nephew, series regular Micah Sanders. In 2008, Nichols starred in the film &quot;The Torturer&quot;, playing the role of a psychiatrist. In 2009, she joined the cast of &quot;The Cabonauts&quot;, a sci-fi musical comedy that debuted on DailyMotion. Playing CJ, the CEO of the Cabonauts Inc, she was also featured singing and dancing. On August 30, 2016, she was introduced as the aging mother of Neil Winters on the long-running soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She received her first Daytime Emmy nomination for &quot;Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series&quot; for the role on March 22, 2017.

=== Music ===
Nichols released two music albums: &quot;Down to Earth,&quot; a collection of standards released in 1967, during the original run of &quot;Star Trek;&quot; and &quot;Out of This World&quot;, released in 1991, a more rock-oriented album themed around &quot;Star Trek&quot; and space exploration.

As Uhura, Nichols sang on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes &quot;Charlie X&quot; and &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;.

== Work with NASA ==

After the cancellation of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Nichols volunteered her time in a special project with NASA to recruit minority and female personnel for the space agency. She began this work by making an affiliation between NASA and a company which she helped to run, Women in Motion.

The program was a success. Among those recruited were Dr. Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, and United States Air Force Colonel Guion Bluford, the first African-American to go into space, as well as Dr. Judith Resnik and Dr. Ronald McNair, who both flew successful missions during the Space Shuttle program before their deaths in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster on January 28, 1986. Recruits also included Charles Bolden, the former NASA administrator and veteran of four shuttle missions, Frederick D. Gregory, former deputy administrator and a veteran of three shuttle missions and Lori Garver, former deputy administrator. An enthusiastic advocate of space exploration, Nichols served from the mid-1980s on the board of governors of the National Space Institute (today&#x27;s National Space Society), a nonprofit, educational space advocacy organization.

In late 2015, Nichols flew aboard NASA&#x27;s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Boeing 747SP, which analyzed the atmospheres of Mars and Saturn on an eight-hour, high-altitude mission. She was also a special guest at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on July 17, 1976, to view the &quot;Viking 1&quot; soft landing on Mars. Along with the other cast members from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, she attended the christening of the first space shuttle, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, at the North American Rockwell assembly facility in Palmdale, California. On July 14, 2010, she toured the space shuttle simulator and Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center.

Nichols&#x27; work with NASA is given significant focus in the documentary &quot;Woman in Motion&quot; about her life.

== Personal life ==

In her autobiography, Nichols wrote that she was romantically involved with &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry for a few years in the 1960s. She said the affair ended well before &quot;Star Trek&quot; began, when she realized Roddenberry was also involved with her acquaintance Majel Hudec (known as Majel Barrett). Hudec went on to marry Gene Roddenberry and have a regular supporting role as nurse Christine Chapel on &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

When Roddenberry&#x27;s health was fading, Nichols co-wrote a song for him, &quot;Gene&quot;, which she sang at his memorial service.

She also wrote that she had &quot;a short, stormy, exciting relationship&quot; with Sammy Davis Jr. in 1959.

Nichols married twice—first to dancer Foster Johnson (1917–1981), whom she married in 1951 and divorced the same year. They had one child together, Kyle Johnson, who was born August 14, 1951. She married Duke Mondy, in 1968; they divorced in 1972.

Nichols&#x27; younger brother, Thomas, was a member of the Heaven&#x27;s Gate cult. He died on March 26, 1997, in the cult&#x27;s mass suicide that purposefully coincided with the passing of Comet Hale–Bopp. A member for 20 years, he frequently identified himself as Nichelle&#x27;s brother in promotional materials released by the cult.

On February 29, 2012, Nichols met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. She later tweeted, &quot;…[President] Obama was quoted as saying that he&#x27;d had a crush on me when he was younger… I asked about that, and he proudly confirmed it! President Obama also confirmed for me that he was definitely a Trekker! How wonderful is that?!&quot;

Nichols was a lifelong Democrat and a practicing Presbyterian.

===Health and death===
In June 2015, Nichols suffered a mild stroke at her Los Angeles home and was admitted to a Los Angeles-area hospital. A magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed a small stroke had occurred, and she began inpatient therapy. In early 2018, she was diagnosed with dementia, and subsequently announced her retirement from convention appearances.

Following a legal dispute over the actions of her manager-turned-caretaker Gilbert Bell, her son Kyle Johnson filed for conservatorship in 2018. Before a court granted his petition in January 2019, Nichols&#x27; friend Angelique Fawcette, who had already expressed concern in 2017 over Bell&#x27;s control of access to her, pressed for visitation rights, including by opposing Johnson&#x27;s petition. That dispute, and a 2019 court case by Bell over being evicted from the guesthouse on Nichols&#x27; property, were both ongoing as of August 2021.

Nichols died of heart failure in Silver City, New Mexico, on July 30, 2022, at the age of 89.

Her ashes were sent into deep space alongside Majel Barrett&#x27;s and Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s.

== Recognition ==
In 1982, Robert A. Heinlein dedicated his novel &quot;Friday&quot; to her. Asteroid 68410 Nichols is named in her honor.

In 1992, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for her contribution to television.
In 1999, Nichols was awarded a Goldene Kamera for (&quot;Cult Star of the Century&quot;). 2010, Nichols received an honorary degree from Los Angeles Mission College.
Nichols received The Life Career Award, from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, in 2016, the first woman to receive it. The award was presented as part of the 42nd Saturn Awards ceremony. Nichols was awarded the Inkpot Award in 2018.

Nichols was an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

&quot;Udea nicholsae&quot;, a species of snout moths, was named in her honour.

The second season of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; began with a pre-credits dedication, referencing one of her recurring lines from the original series: &quot;For Nichelle who was first through the door and showed us the stars. Hailing frequencies forever open...&quot;

<text>An audiophile (from + ) is a person who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. The audiophile seeks to achieve high sound quality in the audio reproduction of recorded music, typically in a quiet listening space in a room with good acoustics.

Audiophile values may be applied at all stages of music reproduction—the initial audio recording, the production process, the storage of sound data, and the playback (usually in a home setting). In general, the values of an audiophile are seen to be antithetical to the growing popularity of more convenient but lower-quality music, especially lossy digital file types like MP3, lower-definition music streaming services, laptop or cell phone speakers, and low-cost headphones.

The term &quot;high-end audio&quot; refers to playback equipment used by audiophiles, which may be bought at specialist shops and websites. High-end components include turntables, digital-to-analog converters, equalization devices, preamplifiers and amplifiers (both solid-state and vacuum tube), loudspeakers (including horn, electrostatic and magnetostatic speakers), power conditioners, subwoofers, headphones, and acoustic room treatment in addition to room correction devices.

Although many audiophile techniques are based on objective criteria that can be verified using techniques like ABX testing, perceived sound quality is necessarily subjective, often with subtle differences, leading to some more controversial audiophile techniques being based on pseudoscientific principles.

==Audio playback components==
An audio system typically consists of one or more source components, one or more amplification components, and (for stereo) two or more loudspeakers.

Signal cables (analog audio, speaker, digital audio etc.) are used to link these components. There are also a variety of accessories, including equipment racks, power conditioners, devices to reduce or control vibration, record cleaners, anti-static devices, phonograph needle cleaners, reverberation reducing devices such as speaker pads and stands, sound absorbent foam, and soundproofing.

The interaction between the loudspeakers and the room (room acoustics) plays an important part in sound quality. Sound vibrations are reflected from walls, floor and ceiling, and are affected by the room&#x27;s contents. Room dimensions can create standing waves at particular (usually low) frequencies. There are devices and materials for room treatment that affect sound quality. Soft materials, such as draperies and carpets, can absorb higher frequencies, whereas hard walls and floors can cause excess reverberation.

=== Sound sources ===
Audiophiles play music from a variety of sources including phonograph records, compact discs (CDs), and digital audio files that are either uncompressed or are losslessly compressed, such as FLAC, DSD, Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless and Apple Lossless (ALAC), in contrast to lossy compression, such as in MP3 encoding. From the early 1990s, CDs were the most common source of high-quality music. Nevertheless, turntables, tonearms, and magnetic cartridges are still used, despite the difficulties of keeping records free from dust and the delicate set-up associated with turntables.

The 44.1 kHz sampling rate of the CD format, in theory, restricts CD information losses to above the theoretical upper-frequency limit of human hearing – 20 kHz. Nonetheless, newer formats such as FLAC, ALAC, DVD-Audio and Super Audio Compact Disc (SACD) allow for sampling rates of 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz or even 192 kHz. Higher sample rates allow fewer restrictions on filter choices in playback components, and some audiophiles upsample from the source rate to higher rates to achieve different filter properties.

CD audio signals are encoded in 16-bit values. Higher-definition consumer formats such as HDCD-encoded CDs, DVD-Audio, and SA-CD contain 20-bit, 24-bit and even 32-bit audio streams. With more bits, more dynamic range is possible; 20-bit dynamic range is theoretically 120 dB—the limit of most consumer electronic playback equipment.

SACDs and DVD-Audio have up to 5.1 to 6.1 surround sound. Although both high-res optical formats have failed, there has been a resurgence in high-res digital files. SACD can be stored as a DSD file, and DVD-Audio can be stored as an FLAC or ALAC file. FLAC is the most widely used digital format for high-res with up to 8 channels, a maximum depth of 32-bit, and 655,350 Hz sampling rate. Uncompressed formats such as WAV and AIFF files can store audio CDs without compression.

=== Amplifiers ===
A preamplifier selects among several audio inputs, amplifies source-level signals (such as those from a turntable), and allows the listener to adjust the sound with volume and tone controls. Many audiophile-oriented preamplifiers lack tone controls. A power amplifier takes the &quot;line-level&quot; audio signal from the preamplifier and drives the loudspeakers. An integrated amplifier combines the functions of power amplification with input switching and volume and tone control. Both pre/power combinations and integrated amplifiers are widely used by audiophiles.

Audiophile amplifiers are available based on solid-state (semiconductor) technology, vacuum-tube (valve) technology, or hybrid technology—semiconductors and vacuum tubes.

Dedicated amplifiers are also commonly used by audiophiles to drive headphones, especially those with high impedance and/or low sensitivity, or electrostatic headphones.

=== Loudspeakers ===
The loudspeaker&#x27;s cabinet is known as the enclosure. There are a variety of loudspeaker enclosure designs, including sealed cabinets (acoustic suspension), ported cabinets (bass-reflex), transmission line, infinite baffles, and horn-loaded. The enclosure plays a major role in the sound of the loudspeaker.

Depending on the frequencies reproduced, the drivers that produce the sound are referred to as tweeters for high frequencies, midranges for middle frequencies, such as voice and lead instruments, and woofers for bass frequencies. Driver designs include dynamic, electrostatic, plasma, ribbon, planar, ionic, and servo-actuated. Drivers are made from various materials, including paper pulp, polypropylene, kevlar, aluminium, magnesium, beryllium, and vapour-deposited diamond.

The direction and intensity of the output of a loudspeaker, called dispersion or polar response, has a large effect on its sound. Various methods are employed to control the dispersion. These methods include monopolar, bipolar, dipolar, 360-degree, horn, waveguide, and line source. These terms refer to the configuration and arrangement of the various drivers in the enclosure.

The positioning of loudspeakers in the room strongly influences the sound experience. Loudspeaker output is influenced by interaction with room boundaries, particularly bass response, and high-frequency transducers are directional, or &quot;beaming&quot;.

=== Accessories ===
Audiophiles use a wide variety of accessories and fine-tuning techniques, sometimes referred to as &quot;tweaks&quot;, to improve the sound of their systems. These include power conditioner filters to &quot;clean&quot; the electricity, equipment racks to isolate components from floor vibrations, specialty power and audio cables, loudspeaker stands (and footers to isolate speakers from stands), and room treatments.

There are several types of room treatment. Sound-absorbing materials may be placed strategically within a listening room to reduce the amplitude of early reflections, and to deal with resonance modes. Other treatments are designed to produce diffusion, reflection of sound in a scattered fashion. Room treatments can be expensive and difficult to optimize.

=== Headphones ===

Headphones are regularly used by audiophiles. These products can be remarkably expensive, some over $10,000, but in general are much cheaper than comparable speaker systems. They have the advantage of not requiring room treatment and being usable without requiring others to listen at the same time. However, many audiophiles still prefer speaker systems over headphones due to their ability to simulate an immersive, rounded sonic environment. Newer canalphones can be driven by the less powerful outputs found on portable music players.

=== Design variety ===

For music storage and playback, digital formats offer an absence of clicks, pops, wow, flutter, acoustic feedback, and rumble, compared to vinyl records. Depending on the format, digital can have a higher signal-to-noise ratio, a wider dynamic range, less total harmonic distortion, and a flatter and more extended frequency response. The digital recording and playback processes may include degradations not found in the analog processes, such as timing jitter and distortions associated with band limiting filter choices. Vinyl records remain popular and discussion about the relative merits of analog and digital sound continues (see Comparison of analog and digital recording). Note that vinyl records may be mastered differently from their digital versions, and multiple digital remasters may exist.

In the amplification stage, vacuum-tube electronics remain popular, despite most other applications having since abandoned tubes for solid state amplifiers. Vacuum-tube amplifiers often have higher total harmonic distortion, require rebiasing, are less reliable, generate more heat, are less powerful, and cost more. There is also continuing debate about the proper use of negative feedback in amplifier design.

== Community ==
The audiophile community is scattered across many different platforms and communication methods. In person, one can find audiophiles at audio-related events such as music festivals, theaters, and concerts. The online audiophile community is even more widespread, with users on web forums and apps such as Facebook, Reddit, and others. These groups are self-identified audiophiles and will often contribute to their communities by mentoring new audiophiles, posting their current audio configurations, and sharing news related to the audiophile community.

Among the listeners themselves, audiophiles will commonly differentiate community members between &quot;golden eared&quot; and &quot;wooden eared&quot; individuals. Those who are deemed as having &quot;golden ears&quot; are people who can accurately express the description of a sound or sonic environment, whereas those with &quot;wooden ears&quot; are implied to be untrained in listening and needing more guidance or assistance. These labels are not permanent, however, and people within these two groups can move between the groups interchangeably, often depending on the judgement of others within the community.

== Controversies ==

There is substantial controversy on the subject of audiophile components; many have asserted that the occasionally high cost produces no measurable improvement in audio reproduction. For example, skeptic James Randi, through his foundation One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, offered a prize of $1 million to anyone able to demonstrate that $7,250 audio cables &quot;are any better than ordinary audio cables&quot;. In 2008, audio reviewer Michael Fremer attempted to claim the prize, and said that Randi declined the challenge. Randi said that the cable manufacturer Pear Cables was the one who withdrew.

Another commonly referenced study done by Philip Greenspun and Leigh Klotz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that although test subjects were able to distinguish between high fidelity, &quot;expensive&quot; cables versus common use cables, there was no statistically significant preference between the two cables. Greenspun and Klotz expect that critics of the study will point to the fact that this experiment was not done as a double-blind test, but this critique has a counter in that the study participants felt as though the experiment solely isolated the subjects&#x27; opinions on sound quality and nothing more.

There is disagreement on how equipment testing should be conducted and its utility. Audiophile publications frequently describe differences in quality which are not detected by standard audio system measurements and double blind testing, claiming that they perceive differences in audio quality which cannot be measured by current instrumentation, and cannot be detected by listeners if listening conditions are controlled, but without providing an explanation for those claims.

Criticisms usually focus on claims around so-called &quot;tweaks&quot; and accessories beyond the core source, amplification, and speaker products. Examples of these accessories include speaker cables, component interconnects, stones, cones, CD markers, and power cables or conditioners. One of the most notorious &quot;tweakers&quot; was Peter Belt, who introduced numerous eccentric innovations that included a £500 &quot;quantum clip&quot; that consisted of a crocodile clip with a short length of copper wire attached.

<text>In mathematics, a field &quot;K&quot; is called a non-Archimedean local field if it is complete with respect to a metric induced by a discrete valuation &quot;v&quot; and if its residue field &quot;k&quot; is finite. In general, a local field is a locally compact topological field with respect to a non-discrete topology. The real numbers R, and the complex numbers C (with their standard topologies) are Archimedean local fields. Given a local field, the valuation defined on it can be of either of two types, each one corresponds to one of the two basic types of local fields: those in which the valuation is Archimedean and those in which it is not. In the first case, one calls the local field an Archimedean local field, in the second case, one calls it a non-Archimedean local field. Local fields arise naturally in number theory as completions of global fields.

While Archimedean local fields have been quite well known in mathematics for at least 250 years, the first examples of non-Archimedean local fields, the fields of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers for positive prime integer &quot;p&quot;, were introduced by Kurt Hensel at the end of the 19th century.

Every local field is isomorphic (as a topological field) to one of the following:

*Archimedean local fields (characteristic zero): the real numbers R, and the complex numbers C.
*Non-Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero: finite extensions of the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers Q&quot;p&quot; (where &quot;p&quot; is any prime number).
*Non-Archimedean local fields of characteristic &quot;p&quot; (for &quot;p&quot; any given prime number): the field of formal Laurent series F&quot;q&quot;((&quot;T&quot;)) over a finite field F&quot;q&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is a power of &quot;p&quot;.

In particular, of importance in number theory, classes of local fields show up as the completions of algebraic number fields with respect to their discrete valuation corresponding to one of their maximal ideals. Research papers in modern number theory often consider a more general notion, requiring only that the residue field be perfect of positive characteristic, not necessarily finite. This article uses the former definition.

==Induced absolute value==

Given such an absolute value on a field &quot;K&quot;, the following topology can be defined on &quot;K&quot;: for a positive real number &quot;m&quot;, define the subset &quot;B&quot;m of &quot;K&quot; by
:formula_1
Then, the &quot;b+B&quot;m make up a neighbourhood basis of b in &quot;K&quot;.

Conversely, a topological field with a non-discrete locally compact topology has an absolute value defining its topology. It can be constructed using the Haar measure of the additive group of the field.

==Basic features of non-Archimedean local fields==

For a non-Archimedean local field &quot;F&quot; (with absolute value denoted by |·|), the following objects are important:
*its ring of integers formula_2 which is a discrete valuation ring, is the closed unit ball of &quot;F&quot;, and is compact;
*the units in its ring of integers formula_3 which forms a group and is the unit sphere of &quot;F&quot;;
*the unique non-zero prime ideal formula_4 in its ring of integers which is its open unit ball formula_5;
*a generator formula_6 of formula_4 called a uniformizer of formula_8;
*its residue field formula_9 which is finite (since it is compact and discrete).

Every non-zero element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;F&quot; can be written as &quot;a&quot; = ϖ&quot;n&quot;&quot;u&quot; with &quot;u&quot; a unit, and &quot;n&quot; a unique integer.
The normalized valuation of &quot;F&quot; is the surjective function &quot;v&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → Z ∪ {∞} defined by sending a non-zero &quot;a&quot; to the unique integer &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; = ϖ&quot;n&quot;&quot;u&quot; with &quot;u&quot; a unit, and by sending 0 to ∞. If &quot;q&quot; is the cardinality of the residue field, the absolute value on &quot;F&quot; induced by its structure as a local field is given by:
:formula_10

An equivalent and very important definition of a non-Archimedean local field is that it is a field that is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and whose residue field is finite.

===Examples===

#The &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers: the ring of integers of Q&quot;p&quot; is the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers Z&quot;p&quot;. Its prime ideal is &quot;pZ&quot;p&quot; and its residue field is Z/&quot;pZ. Every non-zero element of Qp can be written as &quot;u&quot; &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; where &quot;u&quot; is a unit in Z&quot;p&quot; and &quot;n&quot; is an integer, with &quot;v&quot;(&quot;u&quot; &quot;p&quot;n) = &quot;n&quot; for the normalized valuation.
#The formal Laurent series over a finite field: the ring of integers of F&quot;q&quot;((&quot;T&quot;)) is the ring of formal power series F&quot;q&quot;&quot;T&quot;. Its maximal ideal is (&quot;T&quot;) (i.e. the set of power series whose constant terms are zero) and its residue field is F&quot;q&quot;. Its normalized valuation is related to the (lower) degree of a formal Laurent series as follows:
#::formula_11 (where &quot;a&quot;−&quot;m&quot; is non-zero).
#The formal Laurent series over the complex numbers is &quot;not&quot; a local field. For example, its residue field is C&quot;T&quot;/(&quot;T&quot;) = C, which is not finite.

===Higher unit groups===

The &quot;n&quot;th higher unit group of a non-Archimedean local field &quot;F&quot; is
:formula_12
for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1. The group &quot;U&quot;(1) is called the group of principal units, and any element of it is called a principal unit. The full unit group formula_13 is denoted &quot;U&quot;(0).

The higher unit groups form a decreasing filtration of the unit group
:formula_14
whose quotients are given by
:formula_15
for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1. (Here &quot;formula_16&quot; means a non-canonical isomorphism.)

===Structure of the unit group===

The multiplicative group of non-zero elements of a non-Archimedean local field &quot;F&quot; is isomorphic to
:formula_17
where &quot;q&quot; is the order of the residue field, and μ&quot;q&quot;−1 is the group of (&quot;q&quot;−1)st roots of unity (in &quot;F&quot;). Its structure as an abelian group depends on its characteristic:
*If &quot;F&quot; has positive characteristic &quot;p&quot;, then
::formula_18
:where N denotes the natural numbers;
*If &quot;F&quot; has characteristic zero (i.e. it is a finite extension of Q&quot;p&quot; of degree &quot;d&quot;), then
::formula_19
:where &quot;a&quot; ≥ 0 is defined so that the group of &quot;p&quot;-power roots of unity in &quot;F&quot; is formula_20.

== Theory of local fields ==
This theory includes the study of types of local fields, extensions of local fields using Hensel&#x27;s lemma, Galois extensions of local fields, ramification groups filtrations of Galois groups of local fields, the behavior of the norm map on local fields, the local reciprocity homomorphism and existence theorem in local class field theory, local Langlands correspondence, Hodge-Tate theory (also called &quot;p&quot;-adic Hodge theory), explicit formulas for the Hilbert symbol in local class field theory, see e.g.

== Higher-dimensional local fields ==

A local field is sometimes called a &quot;one-dimensional local field&quot;.

A non-Archimedean local field can be viewed as the field of fractions of the completion of the local ring of a one-dimensional arithmetic scheme of rank 1 at its non-singular point.

For a non-negative integer &quot;n&quot;, an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional local field is a complete discrete valuation field whose residue field is an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional local field. Depending on the definition of local field, a &quot;zero-dimensional local field&quot; is then either a finite field (with the definition used in this article), or a perfect field of positive characteristic.

From the geometric point of view, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional local fields with last finite residue field are naturally associated to a complete flag of subschemes of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional arithmetic scheme.

<text>In architecture, a pilaster is both a load-bearing section of thickened wall or column integrated into a wall, and a purely decorative element in classical architecture which gives the appearance of a supporting column and articulates an extent of wall. As an ornament it consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface, usually treated as though it were a column, with a capital at the top, plinth (base) at the bottom, and the various other column elements. In contrast to a Classical pilaster, an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above.

In human anatomy, a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur, which is unique to modern humans. Its structural function is unclear.

==Definition==
A pilaster is foremost a load-bearing architectural element used widely throughout the world and its history where a structural load is carried by a thickened section of wall or column integrated into a wall.

It is also a purely ornamental element used in Classical architecture. As such it may be defined as a flattened column which has lost its three-dimensional and tactile value.&quot;.

===In Classical architecture===
In discussing Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s use of pilasters, which Alberti reintroduced into wall-architecture, Rudolf Wittkower wrote: &quot;The pilaster is the logical transformation of the column for the decoration of a wall.

A pilaster appears with a capital. and entablature, also in &quot;low-relief&quot; or flattened against the wall. Generally, a pilaster often repeats all parts and proportions of an order column; however, unlike it, a pilaster is usually devoid of entasis.

Pilasters often appear on the sides of a door frame or window opening on the facade of a building, and are sometimes paired with columns or pillars set directly in front of them at some distance away from the wall, which support a roof structure above, such as a portico. These vertical elements can also be used to support a recessed archivolt around a doorway. The pilaster can be replaced by ornamental brackets supporting the entablature or a balcony over a doorway.

When a pilaster appears at the corner intersection of two walls it is known as a canton.

As with a column, a pilaster can have a plain or fluted surface to its profile and can be represented in the mode of numerous architectural styles. During the Renaissance and Baroque architects used a range of pilaster forms. In the giant order pilasters appear as two storeys tall, linking floors in a single unit.

The fashion of using this decorative element from ancient Greek and Roman architecture was adopted in the Italian Renaissance, gained wide popularity with Greek Revival architecture, and continues to be seen in some modern architecture.

<doc id="145381" wikidata="Q190046" url="?curid=145381" title="Ellipsoid">
<text>An ellipsoid is a surface that can be obtained from a sphere by deforming it by means of directional scalings, or more generally, of an affine transformation.

An ellipsoid is a quadric surface;  that is, a surface that may be defined as the zero set of a polynomial of degree two in three variables. Among quadric surfaces, an ellipsoid is characterized by either of the two following properties. Every planar cross section is either an ellipse, or is empty, or is reduced to a single point (this explains the name, meaning &quot;ellipse-like&quot;). It is bounded, which means that it may be enclosed in a sufficiently large sphere.

An ellipsoid has three pairwise perpendicular axes of symmetry which intersect at a center of symmetry, called the center of the ellipsoid. The line segments that are delimited on the axes of symmetry by the ellipsoid are called the &quot;principal axes&quot;, or simply axes of the ellipsoid. If the three axes have different lengths, the figure is a triaxial ellipsoid (rarely scalene ellipsoid), and the axes are uniquely defined.

If two of the axes have the same length, then the ellipsoid is an &quot;ellipsoid of revolution&quot;, also called a &quot;spheroid&quot;. In this case, the ellipsoid is invariant under a rotation around the third axis, and there are thus infinitely many ways of choosing the two perpendicular axes of the same length. In the case of two axes being the same length:

* If the third axis is shorter, the ellipsoid is a sphere that has been flattened (called an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot;).
* If the third axis is longer, it is a sphere that has been lengthened (called a &quot;prolate spheroid&quot;). 

If the three axes have the same length, the ellipsoid is a sphere.

==Standard equation==
The general ellipsoid, also known as triaxial ellipsoid, is a quadratic surface which is defined in Cartesian coordinates as:

:formula_1
where formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 are the length of the semi-axes. 

The points formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7 lie on the surface. The line segments from the origin to these points are called the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid, because are half the length of the principal axes. They correspond to the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of an ellipse.

In spherical coordinate system for which formula_8, the general ellipsoid is defined as:

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the polar angle and formula_11 is the azimuthal angle.

When formula_12, the ellipsoid is a sphere.

When formula_13, the ellipsoid is a spheroid or ellipsoid of revolution. In particular, if formula_14, it is an oblate spheroid; if formula_15, it is a prolate spheroid.

== Parameterization ==
The ellipsoid may be parameterized in several ways, which are simpler to express when the ellipsoid axes coincide with coordinate axes. A common choice is
:formula_16

where
:formula_17

These parameters may be interpreted as spherical coordinates, where is the polar angle and is the azimuth angle of the point of the ellipsoid.

Measuring from the equator rather than a pole,
:formula_18

where
:formula_19

 is the reduced latitude, parametric latitude, or eccentric anomaly and is azimuth or longitude.

Measuring angles directly to the surface of the ellipsoid, not to the circumscribed sphere,
:formula_20

where
:formula_21

 would be geocentric latitude on the Earth, and is longitude. These are true spherical coordinates with the origin at the center of the ellipsoid.

In geodesy, the geodetic latitude is most commonly used, as the angle between the vertical and the equatorial plane, defined for a biaxial ellipsoid. For a more general triaxial ellipsoid, see ellipsoidal latitude.

==Volume==
The volume bounded by the ellipsoid is 
:formula_22
In terms of the principal diameters (where , , ), the volume is
:formula_23.
This equation reduces to that of the volume of a sphere when all three elliptic radii are equal, and to that of an oblate or prolate spheroid when two of them are equal.

The volume of an ellipsoid is the volume of a circumscribed elliptic cylinder, and the volume of the circumscribed box. The volumes of the inscribed and circumscribed boxes are respectively:
:formula_24

==Surface area==
The surface area of a general (triaxial) ellipsoid is 
:formula_25

where
:formula_26

and where and are incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively. 

The surface area of this general ellipsoid can also be expressed in terms of , one of the Carlson symmetric forms of elliptic integrals:
:formula_27

Simplifying the above formula using properties of , this can also be expressed in terms of the volume of the ellipsoid :
:formula_28

Unlike the expression with and , the equations in terms of do not depend on the choice of an order on , , and . 

The surface area of an ellipsoid of revolution (or spheroid) may be expressed in terms of elementary functions:
:formula_29
or
:formula_30

or
:formula_31

and 
:formula_32

which, as follows from basic trigonometric identities, are equivalent expressions (i.e. the formula for can be used to calculate the surface area of a prolate ellipsoid and vice versa). In both cases may again be identified as the eccentricity of the ellipse formed by the cross section through the symmetry axis. (See ellipse). Derivations of these results may be found in standard sources, for example Mathworld.

=== Approximate formula ===
: formula_33

Here yields a relative error of at most 1.061%; a value of is optimal for nearly spherical ellipsoids, with a relative error of at most 1.178%.

In the &quot;flat&quot; limit of much smaller than and , the area is approximately , equivalent to .

== Plane sections ==

The intersection of a plane and a sphere is a circle (or is reduced to a single point, or is empty). Any ellipsoid is the image of the unit sphere under some affine transformation, and any plane is the image of some other plane under the same transformation. So, because affine transformations map circles to ellipses, the intersection of a plane with an ellipsoid is an ellipse or a single point, or is empty. Obviously, spheroids contain circles. This is also true, but less obvious, for triaxial ellipsoids (see Circular section).

=== Determining the ellipse of a plane section ===

Given: Ellipsoid and the plane with equation , which have an ellipse in common.

Wanted: Three vectors (center) and , (conjugate vectors), such that the ellipse can be represented by the parametric equation 
:formula_34
(see ellipse).
Solution: The scaling transforms the ellipsoid onto the unit sphere and the given plane onto the plane with equation
:formula_35
Let be the Hesse normal form of the new plane and
:formula_36
its unit normal vector. Hence
:formula_37
is the &quot;center&quot; of the intersection circle and
:formula_38
its radius (see diagram).

Where (i.e. the plane is horizontal), let
:formula_39

Where , let
:formula_40

In any case, the vectors are orthogonal, parallel to the intersection plane and have length (radius of the circle). Hence the intersection circle can be described by the parametric equation
:formula_41

The reverse scaling (see above) transforms the unit sphere back to the ellipsoid and the vectors are mapped onto vectors , which were wanted for the parametric representation of the intersection ellipse. 

How to find the vertices and semi-axes of the ellipse is described in ellipse.

Example: The diagrams show an ellipsoid with the semi-axes which is cut by the plane .
== Pins-and-string construction ==

The pins-and-string construction of an ellipsoid is a transfer of the idea constructing an ellipse using two pins and a string (see diagram).

A pins-and-string construction of an ellipsoid of revolution is given by the pins-and-string construction of the rotated ellipse. 

The construction of points of a &quot;triaxial ellipsoid&quot; is more complicated. First ideas are due to the Scottish physicist J. C. Maxwell (1868). Main investigations and the extension to quadrics was done by the German mathematician O. Staude in 1882, 1886 and 1898. The description of the pins-and-string construction of ellipsoids and hyperboloids is contained in the book &quot;Geometry and the imagination&quot; written by D. Hilbert &amp; S. Vossen, too.

=== Steps of the construction ===
# Choose an &quot;ellipse&quot; and a &quot;hyperbola&quot; , which are a pair of focal conics: formula_42 with the vertices and foci of the ellipse formula_43 and a &quot;string&quot; (in diagram red) of length .
# Pin one end of the string to vertex and the other to focus . The string is kept tight at a point with positive - and -coordinates, such that the string runs from to behind the upper part of the hyperbola (see diagram) and is free to slide on the hyperbola. The part of the string from to runs and slides in front of the ellipse. The string runs through that point of the hyperbola, for which the distance over any hyperbola point is at a minimum. The analogous statement on the second part of the string and the ellipse has to be true, too.
# Then: is a point of the ellipsoid with equation formula_44
# The remaining points of the ellipsoid can be constructed by suitable changes of the string at the focal conics.

=== Semi-axes ===
Equations for the semi-axes of the generated ellipsoid can be derived by special choices for point :
:formula_45

The lower part of the diagram shows that and are the foci of the ellipse in the -plane, too. Hence, it is confocal to the given ellipse and the length of the string is . Solving for yields ; furthermore .

From the upper diagram we see that and are the foci of the ellipse section of the ellipsoid in the -plane and that .

=== Converse ===
If, conversely, a triaxial ellipsoid is given by its equation, then from the equations in step 3 one can derive the parameters , , for a pins-and-string construction. 

=== Confocal ellipsoids ===
If is an ellipsoid confocal to with the squares of its semi-axes 
: formula_46

then from the equations of 
: formula_47

one finds, that the corresponding focal conics used for the pins-and-string construction have the same semi-axes as ellipsoid . Therefore (analogously to the foci of an ellipse) one considers the focal conics of a triaxial ellipsoid as the (infinite many) foci and calls them the focal curves of the ellipsoid.

The converse statement is true, too: if one chooses a second string of length and defines
:formula_48
then the equations
:formula_49
are valid, which means the two ellipsoids are confocal.

=== Limit case, ellipsoid of revolution ===
In case of (a spheroid) one gets and , which means that the focal ellipse degenerates to a line segment and the focal hyperbola collapses to two infinite line segments on the -axis. The ellipsoid is rotationally symmetric around the -axis and
:formula_50.

=== Properties of the focal hyperbola ===

; True curve
: If one views an ellipsoid from an external point of its focal hyperbola, then it seems to be a sphere, that is its apparent shape is a circle. Equivalently, the tangents of the ellipsoid containing point are the lines of a circular cone, whose axis of rotation is the tangent line of the hyperbola at . If one allows the center to disappear into infinity, one gets an orthogonal parallel projection with the corresponding asymptote of the focal hyperbola as its direction. The &quot;true curve of shape&quot; (tangent points) on the ellipsoid is not a circle. The lower part of the diagram shows on the left a parallel projection of an ellipsoid (with semi-axes 60, 40, 30) along an asymptote and on the right a central projection with center and main point on the tangent of the hyperbola at point . ( is the foot of the perpendicular from onto the image plane.) For both projections the apparent shape is a circle. In the parallel case the image of the origin is the circle&#x27;s center; in the central case main point is the center.
; Umbilical points
: The focal hyperbola intersects the ellipsoid at its four umbilical points.

=== Property of the focal ellipse ===
The focal ellipse together with its inner part can be considered as the limit surface (an infinitely thin ellipsoid) of the pencil of confocal ellipsoids determined by for . For the limit case one gets
:formula_51

== In higher dimensions and general position ==
A hyperellipsoid, or ellipsoid of dimension formula_52 in a Euclidean space of dimension formula_53, is a quadric hypersurface defined by a polynomial of degree two that has a homogeneous part of degree two which is a positive definite quadratic form.

One can also define a hyperellipsoid as the image of a sphere under an invertible affine transformation. The spectral theorem can again be used to obtain a standard equation of the form 
:formula_54

The volume of an -dimensional &quot;hyperellipsoid&quot; can be obtained by replacing by the product of the semi-axes in the formula for the volume of a hypersphere:
:formula_55
(where is the gamma function).

=== As a quadric ===
If is a real, symmetric, -by- positive-definite matrix, and is a vector in formula_56 then the set of points that satisfy the equation
:formula_57
is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional ellipsoid centered at . The expression formula_58 is also called the ellipsoidal norm of . For every ellipsoid, there are unique and that satisfy the above equation.

The eigenvectors of are the principal axes of the ellipsoid, and the eigenvalues of are the reciprocals of the squares of the semi-axes (in three dimensions these are , and ). In particular:

* The diameter of the ellipsoid is twice the longest semi-axis, which is twice the square-root of the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of .
* The width of the ellipsoid is twice the shortest semi-axis, which is twice the square-root of the reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue of .

An invertible linear transformation applied to a sphere produces an ellipsoid, which can be brought into the above standard form by a suitable rotation, a consequence of the polar decomposition (also, see spectral theorem). If the linear transformation is represented by a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix, then the eigenvectors of the matrix are orthogonal (due to the spectral theorem) and represent the directions of the axes of the ellipsoid; the lengths of the semi-axes are computed from the eigenvalues. The singular value decomposition and polar decomposition are matrix decompositions closely related to these geometric observations.

For every positive definite matrix formula_59, there exists a unique positive definite matrix denoted , such that formula_60 this notation is motivated by the fact that this matrix can be seen as the &quot;positive square root&quot; of formula_61 The ellipsoid defined by formula_57 can also be presented asformula_63where S(0,1) is the unit sphere around the origin.

=== Parametric representation ===

The key to a parametric representation of an ellipsoid in general position is the alternative definition:
: &quot;An ellipsoid is an affine image of the unit sphere.&quot;

An affine transformation can be represented by a translation with a vector and a regular 3 × 3 matrix :
: formula_64

where are the column vectors of matrix .

A parametric representation of an ellipsoid in general position can be obtained by the parametric representation of a unit sphere (see above) and an affine transformation:
: formula_65.

If the vectors form an orthogonal system, the six points with vectors are the vertices of the ellipsoid and are the semi-principal axes.

A surface normal vector at point is
: formula_66

For any ellipsoid there exists an implicit representation . If for simplicity the center of the ellipsoid is the origin, , the following equation describes the ellipsoid above:
: formula_67

==Applications==
The ellipsoidal shape finds many practical applications:

* Earth ellipsoid, a mathematical figure approximating the shape of the Earth.
* Reference ellipsoid, a mathematical figure approximating the shape of planetary bodies in general.

===Dynamical properties===
The mass of an ellipsoid of uniform density is
:formula_68

The moments of inertia of an ellipsoid of uniform density are
:formula_69

For these moments of inertia reduce to those for a sphere of uniform density.
Ellipsoids and cuboids rotate stably along their major or minor axes, but not along their median axis. This can be seen experimentally by throwing an eraser with some spin. In addition, moment of inertia considerations mean that rotation along the major axis is more easily perturbed than rotation along the minor axis.

One practical effect of this is that scalene astronomical bodies such as generally rotate along their minor axes (as does Earth, which is merely oblate); in addition, because of tidal locking, moons in synchronous orbit such as Mimas orbit with their major axis aligned radially to their planet.

A spinning body of homogeneous self-gravitating fluid will assume the form of either a Maclaurin spheroid (oblate spheroid) or Jacobi ellipsoid (scalene ellipsoid) when in hydrostatic equilibrium, and for moderate rates of rotation. At faster rotations, non-ellipsoidal piriform or oviform shapes can be expected, but these are not stable.

===Fluid dynamics===
The ellipsoid is the most general shape for which it has been possible to calculate the creeping flow of fluid around the solid shape. The calculations include the force required to translate through a fluid and to rotate within it. Applications include determining the size and shape of large molecules, the sinking rate of small particles, and the swimming abilities of microorganisms.

===In probability and statistics===
The elliptical distributions, which generalize the multivariate normal distribution and are used in finance, can be defined in terms of their density functions. When they exist, the density functions have the structure:
:formula_70

where is a scale factor, is an -dimensional random row vector with median vector (which is also the mean vector if the latter exists), is a positive definite matrix which is proportional to the covariance matrix if the latter exists, and is a function mapping from the non-negative reals to the non-negative reals giving a finite area under the curve. The multivariate normal distribution is the special case in which for quadratic form .

Thus the density function is a scalar-to-scalar transformation of a quadric expression. Moreover, the equation for any iso-density surface states that the quadric expression equals some constant specific to that value of the density, and the iso-density surface is an ellipsoid.

<text>In BDSM, service-oriented submission (or sometimes servitude) is the performance of personal tasks for a dominant partner, as part of a submissive role in a BDSM relationship. The submissive is sometimes said to be &quot;in service to&quot; the dominant. Service-oriented submission is part of a spectrum of submissive behaviors, and not all submissives are service-oriented.

In domestic service roles, the submissive can receive pleasure and satisfaction from performing services for their dominant, such as serving as a butler, waitress, chauffeur, maid or housekeeper. Many derive satisfaction from being focused on the needs of another, rather than themselves.

Service-oriented submission can be performed in either , or dignified ways. Bootblacking is a service-oriented task performed within the leather subculture.

Bootblacking may sometimes involve boot-licking as part of the activity.

The satisfaction of service submission is often combined with the pleasures of fetishes, the pleasures of humiliation, or both. A submissive may rub his or her dominant&#x27;s feet because the sub enjoys providing the service, has a foot fetish, enjoys being &quot;lower&quot; than the dominant, or any combination.

<text>Leg shaving is the practice of removing leg hair by shaving the hair off using a razor or electric shaver. In addition, some people remove leg hair using waxing, sugaring, depilatories, epilators or other depilation devices, or lasers, but shaving remains the least expensive and one of the least painful methods.

It is a very common practice among women in the western world, and is also done by some men, especially bodybuilders, cyclists, swimmers, and some runners.

==By gender==
===Women===

In Western countries, many women engage in leg shaving, doing so largely for aesthetic reasons. This practice has developed especially since the early 20th century, around the time of the First World War, as hemlines on women&#x27;s dresses have become shorter and women&#x27;s swimsuits have become more revealing, displaying all of a woman&#x27;s legs.

Some women may only shave the hair below the knee – depending on the length of dress styles in fashion – while others shave the entire leg. The frequency of shaving also varies, with some women shaving their legs every day, and others shaving only at the start of summer, in anticipation of the wearing of a swimsuit.
Special razors, different in shape from those used by men for face-shaving, are often used by women.

===Men===
Among Western men, the shaving of legs is common in sporting situations and in fact has been taking place for longer than women shaving their legs. Male leg hair removal in modern times was initially related to sports, though it is now more frequently done for aesthetics.

For sports such as cycling and swimming, men started shaving their legs around the turn of the 20th century. Most male swimmers, bicycle racers, and some male non-racers shave their legs regularly. The practice is most useful in long-distance swimming, where the effects of drag can cause a significant time difference in races over 400 meters. Other reasons cyclists shave include: faster healing and easier cleaning of road rash, less pain during leg massage.

Seneca suggested that in ancient Rome it was considered an ostentatious bit of effeminacy, contrary to underarm hair removal: &quot;One is, I believe, as faulty as the other: the one class are unreasonably elaborate, the other are unreasonably negligent; the former depilate the leg, the latter not even the armpit&quot; (). Summers cites Ovid, A. A. i. 506 &quot;Don&#x27;t rub your legs smooth with the tight-scraping pumice stone.&quot;

Many athletes also shave their legs or bodies to facilitate therapeutic massage that is frequently a part of their training or post-race recovery programs. They may also shave their legs if they tape protective gear to them to prevent the tape from pulling painfully on the hair when removed. Shaving of the legs is also frequently practiced by male models and bodybuilders, since it accentuates muscle definition.

<text>Newhart is an American television sitcom that aired on CBS from October 25, 1982, to May 21, 1990, with a total of 184 half-hour episodes spanning eight seasons. The series stars Bob Newhart and Mary Frann as an author and his wife, respectively; who own and operate the Stratford Inn in rural Vermont. The small town is home to many eccentric characters. &quot;TV Guide&quot;, TV Land, and A&amp;E named the &quot;Newhart&quot; series finale as one of the most memorable in television history. The theme music for &quot;Newhart&quot; was composed by Henry Mancini.

==Premise==
Bob Newhart plays Dick Loudon, an author of do-it-yourself and travel books. He and his wife Joanna move from New York City to a small town in rural Vermont to operate the 200-year-old Stratford Inn.

Dick and Joanna initially run the inn with the help of sweet-natured but simple handyman George Utley and Leslie Vanderkellen, a bright, cheerful Dartmouth College student and heiress who takes a job as a maid to find out what it is like to be &quot;normal&quot;. Next door to the inn is the Minuteman Café, owned by Kirk Devane, a pathological liar. Leslie leaves before season two to continue her studies abroad, to be replaced by her cousin Stephanie, who, unlike Leslie, is vain, lazy, and spoiled. Brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl take over the Minuteman Cafe when Kirk leaves after season two.

Near the end of season two, Dick becomes the host of a local television show, &quot;Vermont Today&quot;, where he interviews an assortment of bizarre and colorful guests. His vapid, neurotic producer, Michael Harris, falls in love with Stephanie, their relationship providing a satire of 1980s excess. The final episode of the series reveals that the entire series was a dream of Dr. Robert Hartley, Newhart&#x27;s character in &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;.

==Cast==

===Main===
===Recurring===
==Reception==

&quot;Newhart&quot; was a solid ratings winner, finishing its first six seasons in the Nielsen top 25. Despite not finishing in the top 30 for its last two seasons, Bob Newhart stated in an interview with the Archive of American Television that CBS was satisfied enough with the show&#x27;s ratings to renew it for a ninth season in 1990. However, Newhart, who was anxious to move on to other projects, declined the offer, promising CBS that he would develop a new series for the network, which he was under contract to do. This resulted in the 1992 series &quot;Bob&quot;, which lasted two seasons.

<text>George Robert Newhart (September 5, 1929 – July 18, 2024) was an American comedian and actor. Newhart was known for his deadpan and stammering delivery style. Beginning his career as a stand-up comedian, he transitioned his career to acting in television. He received numerous accolades, including three Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2002.

Newhart came to prominence in 1960 when his record album of comedic monologues, &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot;, became a bestseller and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop album chart and won two Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, and Best New Artist. That same year he released his follow-up album, &quot;The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!&quot; (1960), which was also a success, and the two albums held the &quot;Billboard&quot; number one and number two spots simultaneously. He later released several additional comedy albums. 

Newhart hosted a short-lived NBC variety show, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; (1961), before starring as Chicago psychologist Robert Hartley on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; from 1972 to 1978. For the latter, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Male TV Star. He then starred as Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon on the series &quot;Newhart&quot; from 1982 to 1990, where he received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, &quot;Bob&quot; (1992–1993) and &quot;George and Leo&quot; (1997–1998).

Newhart also acted in the films &quot;Hell Is for Heroes&quot; (1962), &quot;Hot Millions&quot; (1968), &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (1971), &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), and &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), and voiced Bernard in the Disney animated film &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977) and its sequel (1990). Newhart played Professor Proton on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; from 2013 to 2018, for which he received his first-ever career Emmy Award, for the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He also reprised his role in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; prequel spin-off series &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; (2017–2020).

== Early life and education ==
George Robert Newhart was born on September 5, 1929, in Oak Park, Illinois. His parents were Julia Pauline (&quot;née&quot; Burns; 1901–1994), a housewife, and George David Newhart (1899–1987), a part-owner of a plumbing supply business. His mother was of Irish descent, while his father was of German and Irish descent. He went by his middle name, &quot;Bob,&quot; to avoid confusion with his father. The family name Newhart is of German origin (&quot;Neuhart&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb/title/5984620&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of his grandmothers was from St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. He had three sisters.

Newhart was educated at Catholic schools in the Chicago area, including St. Catherine of Siena Grammar School in Oak Park, and attended St. Ignatius College Prep (high school), graduating in 1947. He then enrolled at Loyola University Chicago, from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business management. Newhart was drafted into the U.S. Army and, until his discharge, in 1954, served as a U.S.-based clerk during the Korean War. He briefly attended Loyola University Chicago School of Law, but did not complete a degree, in part, he said, because he had been asked to behave unethically during an internship.

== Career ==
=== 1958–1971: Comedy albums and stardom ===

After the war, Newhart worked for United States Gypsum as an accountant. He later said that his motto, &quot;That&#x27;s close enough,&quot; and his habit of adjusting petty cash imbalances with his own money showed that he lacked the temperament of an accountant. In 1958, Newhart became an advertising copywriter for Fred A. Niles, a major independent film and television producer in Chicago. There, he and a co-worker entertained each other with long telephone calls about absurd scenarios, which they later recorded and sent to radio stations as audition tapes. When the co-worker ended his participation by taking a job in New York, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing routines.

Dan Sorkin, a radio station disc jockey, who later became the announcer-sidekick on Newhart&#x27;s NBC series, introduced Newhart to the head of talent at Warner Bros. Records. Based solely on those recordings, the label signed him in 1959, only a year after it had come into existence. Newhart expanded his material into a stand-up routine that he began to perform at nightclubs. He became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he played a solo &quot;straight man&quot;. Newhart&#x27;s routine was to portray one end of a conversation (usually a phone call), playing the comedic straight man while implying what the other person was saying. Newhart&#x27;s 1960 comedy album &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; was the first comedy album to make number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart. It won two Grammy Awards, Album of the Year, and Best New Artist.

Newhart told a 2005 interviewer for PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Masters&quot; that his favorite stand-up routine was &quot;Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue&quot;, which appears on this album. In the routine, a slick promoter has to deal with Lincoln&#x27;s reluctance to agree to efforts to boost his image. Chicago TV director and future comedian Bill Daily, who was Newhart&#x27;s castmate on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, suggested the routine to him. A follow-up album, &quot;The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!&quot;, was released six months later and won Best Comedy Performance – Spoken Word that year. His subsequent comedy albums include &quot;Behind the Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; (1961), &quot;The Button-Down Mind on TV&quot; (1962), &quot;Bob Newhart Faces Bob Newhart&quot; (1964), &quot;The Windmills Are Weakening&quot; (1965), &quot;This Is It&quot; (1967), &quot;Best of Bob Newhart&quot; (1971), and &quot;Very Funny Bob Newhart&quot; (1973). Years later, he released &quot;Bob Newhart Off the Record&quot; (1992), &quot;The Button-Down Concert&quot; (1997), and &quot;Something Like This&quot; (2001), an anthology of his 1960s Warner Bros. albums. On December 10, 2015, publicist and comedy album collector Jeff Abraham revealed that a &quot;lost&quot; Newhart track from 1965 about Paul Revere existed on a one-of-a-kind acetate, which he owns. The track made its world premiere on episode 163 of the &quot;Comedy on Vinyl&quot; podcast.

Newhart&#x27;s success in stand-up led to his own short-lived NBC variety show in 1961, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. The show lasted only a single season, but it earned Newhart a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and a Peabody Award. The Peabody Board cited him as &quot;a person whose gentle satire and wry and irreverent wit waft a breath of fresh and bracing air through the stale and stuffy electronic corridors. A merry marauder, who looks less like St. George than a choirboy, Newhart has wounded, if not slain, many of the dragons that stalk our society. In a troubled and apprehensive world, Newhart has proved once again that laughter is the best medicine.&quot; In the mid-1960s, Newhart was one of the initial three co-hosts of the variety show &quot;The Entertainers&quot; (1964), with Carol Burnett and Caterina Valente, appeared on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; 24 times and on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; eight times. He appeared in a 1963 episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;How to Get Rid of Your Wife&quot;; and on &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;. He also appeared on series such as &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;Captain Nice&quot;, and &quot;Insight&quot;. Newhart guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; 87 times, and hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; twice, in 1980 and 1995. In 1964, he appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in London, before Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1962, Newhart filmed &quot;An Evening with Bob Newhart&quot;, thought to be the first pay-per-view television special, for Canadian-based Telemeter.

=== 1972–1978: &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; ===
Newhart starred in two long-running sitcoms. In 1972, soon after he guest-starred on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, he was approached by his agent and his managers, producer Grant Tinker, and actress Mary Tyler Moore (the husband/wife team who founded MTM Enterprises), to work on a series called &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, to be written by David Davis and Lorenzo Music. He was very interested in the starring role of psychologist Bob Hartley, with Suzanne Pleshette playing his wry, loving wife, Emily, and Bill Daily as neighbor and friend Howard Borden.

&quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; was a part of the CBS comedy lineup on Saturday Night consisting of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. The series was an immediate hit. The show eventually referenced what made Newhart&#x27;s name in the first place; apart from the first few episodes, it used an opening-credits sequence featuring Newhart answering a telephone in his office. According to co-star Marcia Wallace, the entire cast got along well, and Newhart became close friends with both Wallace and co-star Suzanne Pleshette.

In addition to Wallace as Bob&#x27;s wisecracking, man-chasing receptionist Carol Kester, the cast included Peter Bonerz as amiable orthodontist Jerry Robinson; Jack Riley as Elliot Carlin, the most misanthropic of Hartley&#x27;s patients; character actor and voice artist John Fiedler as milquetoast Emil Petersen; and Pat Finley as Bob&#x27;s sister, Ellen Hartley, a love interest for Howard Borden. Future &quot;Newhart&quot; regular Tom Poston had a briefly recurring role as Cliff &quot;Peeper&quot; Murdock, veteran stage actor Barnard Hughes appeared as Bob&#x27;s father for three episodes spread over two seasons, and Martha Scott appeared in several episodes as Bob&#x27;s mother.

By 1977, the show&#x27;s ratings were declining and Newhart wanted to end it, but was under contract to do one more season. The show&#x27;s writers tried to rework the sitcom by adding a pregnancy, but Newhart objected: &quot;I told the creators I didn&#x27;t want any children, because I didn&#x27;t want it to be a show about &#x27;How stupid Daddy is, but we love him so much, let&#x27;s get him out of the trouble he&#x27;s gotten himself into&#x27;.&quot; Nevertheless, the staff wrote an episode that they hoped would change Newhart&#x27;s mind. Newhart read the script and he agreed it was very funny. He then asked, &quot;Who are you going to get to play Bob?&quot; Coincidentally, Newhart&#x27;s wife gave birth to their daughter Jenny late in the year, which caused him to miss several episodes.

In the last episode of the fifth season, not only was Bob&#x27;s wife, Emily, pregnant, but his receptionist, Carol, was, too. In the first show of the sixth season, Bob revealed his dream of the pregnancies and that neither Emily nor Carol was really pregnant. Marcia Wallace spoke of Newhart&#x27;s amiable nature on set: &quot;He&#x27;s very low key, and he didn&#x27;t want to cause trouble. I had a dog by the name of Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And whenever there was a line that Bob didn&#x27;t like—he didn&#x27;t want to complain too much—so, he&#x27;d go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he&#x27;d say, &quot;See, I told you it&#x27;s not funny!&quot;. Wallace also commented on the show&#x27;s lack of Emmy recognition: &quot;People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!&quot; Newhart discontinued the series in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, &quot;It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together.&quot;

Of Newhart&#x27;s other long-running sitcom, &quot;Newhart&quot;, Wallace said: &quot;But some of the other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn&#x27;t always work. And that&#x27;s what... but like Bob, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he&#x27;s not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well.&quot; She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart&#x27;s short-lived sitcom, &quot;George &amp; Leo&quot;, in 1997.

Although primarily a television star, Newhart appeared in a number of popular films, beginning with the 1959 war story &quot;Hell Is for Heroes&quot; (where he did his one-sided telephone act in a bunker). In 1968, Newhart played an annoying software specialist in the film &quot;Hot Millions&quot;. His films include 1970&#x27;s Alan Jay Lerner musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, the 1971 Norman Lear comedy &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, Mike Nichols&#x27;s war satire &quot;Catch-22&quot;, the 1977 Disney animated feature &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and its 1990 sequel &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; as the voice of Bernard, and he played the president of the United States in the comedy &quot;First Family&quot; (1980).

=== 1982–1990: &quot;Newhart&quot; ===
By 1982, Newhart was interested in a new sitcom. After he had discussions with Barry Kemp and CBS, the show &quot;Newhart&quot; was created, in which Newhart played Vermont innkeeper and TV talk show host Dick Loudon. Mary Frann was cast as his wife, Joanna. Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after former daytime soap star Julia Duffy joined the cast as Dick&#x27;s inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen. Peter Scolari (who had been a fan of Newhart&#x27;s since he was 17) was also cast as Dick&#x27;s manipulative TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons. Steven Kampmann, who was a neighbor for a while, was cast as Kirk Devane for two years, at a cafe he owned. Character actor Tom Poston played the role of handyman George Utley, earning three Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1984, 1986, and 1987. Like &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot; was an immediate hit, and again, like the show before it, it was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habit finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary polycythemia. The doctors ordered him to stop smoking.

In 1987, ratings began to drop. &quot;Newhart&quot; ended in 1990 after eight seasons and 182 episodes. The last episode ended with a scene in which Newhart wakes up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette, who played Emily, his wife from &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. He realizes (in a satire of a famous plot element in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; a few years earlier) that the entire eight-year &quot;Newhart&quot; series had been a single nightmare of Dr. Bob Hartley&#x27;s, which Emily attributes to eating Japanese food before he went to bed. Recalling Mary Frann&#x27;s buxom figure and proclivity for wearing sweaters, Bob closes the segment and the series by telling Emily, &quot;You really should wear more sweaters&quot; before the typical closing notes of the old &quot;Bob Newhart Show&quot; theme played over the fadeout. The twist ending was later chosen by &quot;TV Guide&quot; as the best finale in television history. With the exception of the series finale, Newhart simply said &quot;meow&quot; in the MTM Productions closing logo on all episodes. The finale&#x27;s logo used a sound clip of the two brothers named Darryl shouting &quot;QUIET!!!&quot; in unison; prior to this, only their brother Larry ever spoke a word while they remained silent.

=== 1991–2012: Established career ===

In addition to stand-up comedy, Newhart became a dedicated character actor in film and television. Newhart played a beleaguered school principal in &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), acted in the Will Ferrell Christmas comedy film &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), and made a cameo appearance as a sadistic but appreciative CEO at the end of the comedy &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; (2011). He appeared on &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;Committed&quot;, reprised his role as Dr. Bob Hartley on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, and appeared as himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Newhart had a role on &quot;NCIS&quot; as Ducky&#x27;s mentor and predecessor, a retired forensic pathologist, who was discovered to have Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In 1992, Newhart returned to television with a series about a cartoonist called &quot;Bob&quot;. The ensemble cast included Lisa Kudrow, but the show did not develop a strong audience and was cancelled shortly after the start of its second season, despite good critical reviews. On &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; following the cancellation, Newhart joked he had now done shows called &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot; so that his next show was going to be called &quot;The&quot;. In 1997, Newhart returned again with &quot;George &amp; Leo&quot; on CBS with Judd Hirsch and Jason Bateman (Newhart&#x27;s first name being George); the show was cancelled during its first season. In 1995, Newhart was approached by Showtime to make the first comedy special of his 35-year career, &quot;Off the Record&quot;, which consisted of him performing material from his first and second albums in front of an audience in Pasadena, California.
In 2003, Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of &quot;ER&quot; in a rare dramatic role that earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, his first in nearly 20 years. In 2005, he began a recurring role in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as Morty, the on-again/off-again boyfriend of Sophie (Lesley Ann Warren), Susan Mayer&#x27;s (Teri Hatcher) mother. In 2009, he received another Primetime Emmy nomination for reprising his role as Judson in &quot;The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice&quot;. On August 27, 2006, at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, hosted by Conan O&#x27;Brien, Newhart was placed in a supposedly airtight glass prison that contained three hours of air. If the Emmys went over the time of three hours, he would die. This gag was an acknowledgment of the common frustration that award shows usually run on past their allotted time (usually three hours). Newhart &quot;survived&quot; his containment to help O&#x27;Brien present the award for Outstanding Comedy Series (which went to &quot;The Office&quot;). During an episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Newhart made a comedic cameo with members of the ABC show &quot;Lost&quot; lampooning an alternate ending to the series finale. In 2011, he appeared in a small but pivotal role as a doctor in Lifetime&#x27;s anthology film on breast cancer, &quot;Five&quot;.

=== 2013–2020: &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and final roles ===
In 2013, Newhart appeared in an episode of the sixth season of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; playing the aged Professor Proton (Arthur Jeffries), a former science TV show host turned children&#x27;s party entertainer, for which he was awarded a Primetime Emmy Award. It was Newhart&#x27;s first Emmy. At that year&#x27;s Emmy ceremony, Newhart appeared as a presenter with &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; star Jim Parsons and received a standing ovation. He continued to play the character periodically through the show&#x27;s 12th and final season and on its spinoff &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. On December 19, 2014, the 85-year-old Newhart made a surprise appearance on the final episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, where he was revealed to be the person inside Secretariat, Ferguson&#x27;s on-set pantomime horse. The show then ended with a scene parodying the &quot;Newhart&quot; series finale, with Ferguson and Drew Carey reprising their roles from &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. In June 2015, Newhart appeared on another series finale, that of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, playing the father-in-law of Joy Scroggs (Jane Leeves). It marked a reunion with Betty White, who was a cast member during the second season of &quot;Bob&quot; 23 years earlier. The finale ends with their characters getting married.

== Comedic style ==
Newhart was known for his deadpan delivery and a slight stammer that he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career. The hesitant stammer was his natural speaking style – &quot;Truly, that&#x27;s ... the ... way I talk&quot; – and he used it to build tension in the audience, &quot;Tension is very important to comedy. And the release of the tension – &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; the laugh.&quot;

On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the Jack Benny tradition of being the &quot;straight man&quot; while the sometimes rather bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs. But Newhart said, &quot;I was not influenced by Jack Benny&quot;, and cited George Gobel and Bob and Ray as his initial writing and performance inspirations.

Several of his routines involved hearing half of a conversation as he spoke to someone on the phone. In a bit called &quot;King Kong&quot;, a rookie security guard at the Empire State Building seeks guidance as to how to deal with an ape that is &quot;between 18 and 19 stories high, depending on whether there&#x27;s a 13th floor or not.&quot; He assured his boss he has looked in the guards&#x27; manual &quot;under &#x27;ape&#x27; and &#x27;ape&#x27;s toes&#x27;.&quot; His other famous routines included &quot;The Driving Instructor&quot;, &quot;The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (and Storm Door Company)&quot;, &quot;Introducing Tobacco to Civilization&quot;, &quot;Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue&quot;, &quot;Defusing a Bomb&quot; (in which an uneasy police chief tries to walk a new and nervous patrolman through defusing a live shell discovered on a beach), &quot;The Retirement Party&quot;, &quot;Ledge Psychology&quot;, &quot;The Khrushchev Landing Rehearsal&quot;, and &quot;A Friend with a Dog.&quot;

In a 2012 podcast interview with Marc Maron, comedian Shelley Berman accused Newhart of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style (although not any actual material of Berman&#x27;s). However, in interviews both years before and after Berman&#x27;s comments, Newhart never took credit for originating the telephone concept, which he noted was done earlier by Berman and — predating Berman — Nichols and May, George Jessel (in his well-known sketch &quot;Hello Mama&quot;), and in the 1913 recording &quot;Cohen on the Telephone&quot;. Starting in the 1940s, Arlene Harris also built a long radio and TV career around her one-sided telephone conversations, and the technique was later also used by Lily Tomlin, Ellen DeGeneres, and others.

== Personal life ==
=== Family life ===
On January 12, 1963, Newhart married Virginia Lillian &quot;Ginnie&quot; Quinn (December 9, 1940 – April 23, 2023). She was a daughter of character actor Bill Quinn, and met Newhart via an introduction by comedian Buddy Hackett. The couple had four children: Robert (born 1963), Timothy (born 1967), Jennifer (born 1971), and Courtney (born 1977), followed by 10 grandchildren. Both Catholics, the couple raised their children in that faith. Bob was a member of the Church of the Good Shepherd and the related Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. Ginnie died at age 82 on April 23, 2023.

Newhart was the uncle of actor and comedian Paul Brittain.

The Newhart and Rickles families were close, often vacationing together. Don Rickles and Newhart appeared together on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on January 24, 2005, the Monday following Johnny Carson&#x27;s death, reminiscing about their many appearances on Carson&#x27;s show. The two also appeared together on the television sitcom &quot;Newhart&quot; and for previous episodes of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, where Newhart or Rickles were guest hosts. The friendship was memorialized in &quot;Bob &amp; Don: A Love Story,&quot; a 2023 short documentary film by Judd Apatow, released by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, featuring interviews, as well as home videos, with both families.

For over 25 years, Newhart&#x27;s family lived in a mansion in Bel Air. The house was designed by Wallace Neff in a French Country style. The , five-bedroom home featured formal gardens, a lagoon-style pool with waterfall, and guest apartment. Newhart sold the property to developers in May 2016 for $14.5 million. The new property owners razed the mansion and sold the empty lot for $17.65 million in 2017.

=== Interests ===
In 1995, Newhart was one of several investors in Rotijefco (a blend of his children&#x27;s names), which bought radio station KKSB (AM 1290 kHz) in Santa Barbara, California. Its format was changed to adult standards and its call sign to KZBN (his initials). In 2005, Rotijefco sold the station to Santa Barbara Broadcasting, which changed its call sign to KZSB and format to news and talk radio.

Newhart was an early home-computer hobbyist, purchasing the Commodore PET after its 1977 introduction. In 2001, he wrote, &quot;Later, I moved up to the 64 KB model and thought that was silly because it was more memory than I would ever possibly need.&quot;

== Health and death ==
In 1985, Newhart was hospitalized for secondary polycythemia, a condition attributed to his years of heavy smoking. He recovered after several weeks and eventually quit smoking.

Newhart died from complications of several short illnesses at his home in Los Angeles on July 18, 2024, at the age of 94. Upon his death, President Joe Biden released a statement which read, &quot;Today, we mourn the loss of Bob Newhart, a comedy legend and beloved performer who kept Americans laughing for decades.&quot; Those who paid tributes to Newhart included Reese Witherspoon, James Woods, Julie Bowen, Carol Burnett, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Alec Baldwin, Judd Apatow, Kaley Cuoco, Mayim Bialik, Kunal Nayyar, Iain Armitage, Al Franken, Mark Hamill, and Jamie Lee Curtis.

He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<text>Santos Benigno Laciar (born January 31, 1959), known familiarly as Santos Laciar and nicknamed Falucho, is an Argentine who was boxing&#x27;s world flyweight and super flyweight champion.

==Biography==
Laciar was born in Huinca Renancó, in the province of Córdoba, Argentina.

Laciar began his career in his hometown, on December 3 of 1976, knocking out Carlos Maliene in four rounds. After three more wins, all by knockout, he was faced with Alejandro Holguin, who held him to a ten-round draw, becoming the first boxer to face Laciar and not come out on the losing end. After three more wins, he drew once again, this time against Jose Ibiris, but in his next fight, he was able to take the Córdoba State Flyweight title away from Carlos Reyes Sosa in Villa María with a 12-round decision. He finished 1977 with four more wins, including a knockout in six in a rematch with Reyes Sosa.

In 1978 he had 13 fights, for an average of slightly more than one fight per month. Among his fights that year: a rematch with Ibiris, which ended in a ten-round decision win for Laciar, two fights versus contender Ramon Soria, which ended in a draw and in Laciar&#x27;s first defeat, a 10-round decision loss, a fight with Luis Gerez, who drew with Laciar, and Laciar&#x27;s Buenos Aires debut, a 10-round decision win over Angel Luis Fernandez.

1979 was another busy year for Laciar, boxing 13 times again during that year. He won 9 of those bouts. Among his fights in &#x27;79, a loss to future world Junior bantamweight champion Gustavo Ballas, who beat him in 10 on points, a rubber match with Ibris, resulting in another Laciar 10-round decision win, two decision losses to Raúl Pérez, and a 10-round decision win against top contender Federico Condori.

But early in 1980 Laciar started what would turn out to be a great decade for him. He was matched with Miguel Lanzarte on February 26 of that year for the vacant Argentinian flyweight title and won the bout by a decision in 12. After a draw in ten against Condori&#x27;s brother Ruben, he won four straight bouts, and on August 30, he challenged for the South American flyweight title. In what was his first fight outside Argentina, he and South American champion Jaime Miranda battled to an 8-round no contest (a no contest is declared when circumstances beyond boxing cause the fight to be stopped) in Santiago, Chile. After one more win over Federico Condori, Miranda returned the favor by travelling to Laciar&#x27;s country and this time, Laciar won the South American title with a 12-round decision win. Laciar finished the year by travelling to England, where he lost a 10-round decision to future world champion Charlie Magri.

In 1981, one day before his birthday, he beat Jose de la Cruz in Mar del Plata. He was already ranked number one by the WBA, and in March he flew to South Africa, where he beat Peter Mathebula on the 28th day of that month, by a knockout in seven rounds to become the world&#x27;s flyweight champion. After the retirement of Carlos Monzón in 1977 and Victor Galindez in 1978, (Galindez died in 1980 in an auto race accident), Argentina was in need of a world champion boxer, and Laciar became a national hero instantly.

A rematch with Lanzarte, resulting in a 10-round non title decision win, followed, and then he fought at the Luna Park, where he lost his title to Luis Ibarra.

Ibarra lost his title in his first defense to Juan Herrera, and after 5 more bouts, Laciar challenged Herrera in the champion&#x27;s hometown of Tampico, Mexico. Laciar recovered the crown by a knockout in 13 rounds, and this time, he wouldn&#x27;t lose it again. He defended it for three years, after which he left it vacant. He defeated former world champion Betulio González in Maracaibo, Venezuela by a decision in 15, Steve Muchoki in Copenhagen, Denmark by a knockout in 13, Ramon Nery (a deaf-mute boxer) by a knockout in 9 at Córdoba, Shuichi Hozumi by a knockout in 2 in Japan, Hee Sup Chin, by a knockout in one in South Korea, Juan Herrera, in a rematch at Marsala, Italy, by a decision in 15, former world champion Prudencio Cardona by a knockout in 10 in Córdoba, former two-time world Junior Flyweight champion Hilario Zapata by a decision in 15 at Buenos Aires, and Antoine Monteiro, beaten by a knockout in 11 at Paris, France. After his fight with Monteiro, he decided to leave the world Flyweight championship vacant. His fame also surpassed the Argentinian borders and he became famous all over Latin America, &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s Spanish edition featuring him on the cover many times, as well as on posters and articles. He was also on the cover of &quot;Guantes&quot; magazine multiple times during his second period as champion.

On June 8, 1986, he and Jaime Miranda had a rubber match, Laciar winning a ten-round decision. Two months later, world Junior Bantamweight champion, Mexican Gilberto Roman, travelled to Argentina to defend his WBC and Lineal crown versus Laciar, the fight ending in a 12-round draw. Six more wins followed, including one against Hector Patri, and then on May 16 of 1987, he and Roman met again. This time the WBC chose a neutral place for the fight, but Laciar won the fight by a knockout in 11 at Reims, France, becoming a world champion for the third time. However, in his first title defense, Laciar was on the losing end of a decision against Colombian Sugar Baby Rojas in Miami.

Laciar kept on boxing and reeled off eight more straight wins, but on October 8, 1988, he was outpointed by Juan Carazo in Caguas, Puerto Rico, by a decision in 12 rounds. Two more wins and another no contest followed, and, after Carazo lost in his title try against Roman by decision, it was Laciar&#x27;s turn to face the Mexican again. This time, they boxed in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, California, and Roman came out victorious by a 12-round decision.

Roman would die in a car crash the next year, and all chances of a fourth bout between the two, which was a possibility that was being talked about, were dashed with Roman&#x27;s death.

Laciar fought three more bouts, all in 1990, after which he decided to retire. A world-traveling boxer, Laciar had fights in twelve countries, not counting fights held at his native Argentina. The countries he visited as a professional boxer to fight at were, in the following order, Chile, the United Kingdom (specifically, England), South Africa, Mexico, Venezuela, Denmark, Japan, South Korea, Italy, France, the United States and Puerto Rico.

His final record was 79 wins, 10 losses, 11 draws and 1 fight ended in a no-contest, with 31 wins coming by knockout.

==After retirement==
Laciar became an occasional boxing commentator for TyC Sports&#x27;s Saturday night boxing show, &quot;Boxeo de Primera&quot;.

<doc id="145394" wikidata="Q1138095" url="?curid=145394" title="Salt Lake Bees">
<text>The Salt Lake Bees are a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) team that plays in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and are the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. Based in South Jordan, Utah, the team will begin play at Daybreak Field at America First Square in 2025. The team previously played its home games at Smith&#x27;s Ballpark in Salt Lake City from its opening in 1994 until the end of the 2024 season. Formerly known as the Salt Lake Buzz from 1994 to 2000 and the Salt Lake Stingers from 2001 to 2005, the team adopted the Bees moniker in 2006. Since their inception in 1994, they have been a part of the PCL, including the 2021 season when the league was called Triple-A West.

==History==
===Prior Salt Lake City teams===
After the 1914 Pacific Coast League season, Salt Lake City businessman Bill &quot;Hardpan&quot; Lane purchased the Sacramento Solons and brought the team to Utah as the Salt Lake City Bees. Though a charter member of the PCL, the Solons suffered on the field and at the gate, being exiled at times to Tacoma, Fresno, and San Francisco. On March 31, 1915, their first game was played with 10,000 fans pouring into Majestic Park (later renamed Bonneville Park) to cheer the Bees to a 9–3 win over the Vernon Tigers.[Salt Lake &quot;Telegram&quot;, April 1, 1915, p. 3]

The original Bees never won a PCL pennant, but they drew attendees well, especially considering the small market size. However, other PCL team owners resented the high cost of travel to Salt Lake City. When the Vernon Tigers abandoned Los Angeles after the 1925 season, it was suggested to Lane that he would do well to transfer his team to Southern California. After 11 seasons, the Bees moved to Los Angeles for the 1926 season. Initially known as the Hollywood Bees, the team soon became the Hollywood Stars. After ten seasons in Hollywood, the team transferred again to San Diego, where it played as the San Diego Padres from 1936 to 1968. Salt Lake City was without a baseball team until 1946, when it received a franchise in the Pioneer League.

Salt Lake City once was home to an all-black baseball team called the Occidentals. They played during the early 1900s against white teams in Utah and across the Western United States.

===Salt Lake Bees (1994–present)===

The current franchise dates from 1994, when Joe Buzas, a former major league player and the owner of the PCL Portland Beavers, moved the team to Salt Lake City. Buzas made a deal wherein the city would build a new ballpark on the site of historic Derks Field in exchange for relocating the team. The new ballpark, Franklin Quest Field, opened in 1994 with the renamed Salt Lake Buzz drawing 713,224 fans to home games during their inaugural season—breaking the PCL single-season attendance record that had stood for 48 years. Buzas owned the team until his death in 2003. The team was purchased by Larry H. Miller, who also owned the NBA&#x27;s Utah Jazz. Miller died in February 2009, and the team is owned by his widow, Gail Miller. 

Known as the Salt Lake Buzz from 1994 to 2000, the team changed its name to the Salt Lake Stingers in 2001. The change was forced by a trademark dilution lawsuit filed by Georgia Tech, whose yellowjacket mascot is named Buzz.

Following the 2005 season, the team announced the Stingers would henceforth be known as the Salt Lake Bees, the name of the original PCL franchise which played in Salt Lake City from 1915 to 1926 and from 1958 to 1965. The team also chose a logo, jersey, and color scheme similar to the latter Bees PCL franchise. Bees have long been a symbol of Utah. The original name of the Mormon settlement, Deseret, is said to be the word for &quot;honeybee&quot; in the Book of Mormon; a beehive appears on the Utah state flag; the state motto is &quot;Industry&quot; (for which bees are known); and Utah is widely known as the &quot;Beehive State.&quot;

In 2019, the Bees announced a new logo, name, and branding for the team, taking on the name &quot;Abejas de Salt Lake&quot; for their ongoing participation in The Copa de la Diversión.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Bees were organized into the Triple-A West. Salt Lake ended the season in fifth place in the Western Division with a 49–70 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Salt Lake finished the tournament tied for seventh place with a 6–4 record. In 2022, the Triple-A West became known as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In the early part of the 2023 season, Jo Adell broke a franchise record with a six-game straight home run streak.

In early 2024, Marc Amicone left the Bees to become an advisor on baseball matters for the Larry H. Miller Company. He will work with the company and Big League Utah in their efforts to bring a Major League Baseball team to Utah. The team named Ty Wardle, the Bees&#x27; former chief revenue officer as the new general manager. Cameron Coughlan was hired as assistant general manager.

During the 2024 season, three-time Major League Baseball MVP Mike Trout played with the Bees as part of his physical rehabilitation. Trout had previously played for the Bees in 2012.

The Bees plan to leave Smith&#x27;s Ballpark for Daybreak Field at America First Square, a new ballpark in South Jordan, Utah, after the 2024 season.

In 2024, the Bees have played under multiple names including the Buzz, Gulls, Occidentals, Trappers and Stingers. They played under the name Malmö Oat Milkers due to a licensing deal that Minor League Baseball struck with the Swedish firm Oatly. Oatly operates a plant in Ogden, Utah.

The Bees played their final game at Smith&#x27;s Ballpark on September 22, 2024.

The Bees introduced new uniforms and logos in late 2024.

==Coaches==
===Keith Johnson===
Keith Johnson joined the Bees&#x27; management team in 2016, following a one-season stint as an instructor for the Angels. Over the course of three seasons, he achieved an additional 195 victories. However, his streak was briefly interrupted in 2018 when he received a promotion to an assistant&#x27;s position within the Angels&#x27; office in Los Angeles. At the time of his departure, Johnson had amassed a total of 468 wins. Subsequently, he transitioned to the Miami Marlins organization after the 2018 season, where he spent four years alternating between the minor league and major league coaching staffs. In 2023, Johnson made a return to the Bees. On April 6, 2023, with the Bees&#x27; triumph, Johnson set the record for the coach with the highest number of all-time wins in the Bees&#x27; history. At that point, Johnson was just 23 victories away from reaching the milestone of 500 wins. It is worth noting that Johnson himself had a previous career as a minor league baseball player, during which he had played for the Bees.

==Venue==
The Bees play at Smith&#x27;s Ballpark. It was formerly known as Franklin Covey Field. It was renamed in 2014.

On January 17, 2023, the Larry H. Miller Company announced they would build a new baseball stadium in Daybreak, a master-planned community in South Jordan, Utah, for the Salt Lake Bees. Construction on the privately financed stadium is expected to begin in 2023 and be completed in time for the 2025 season. The Bees will continue playing at Smith&#x27;s Ballpark until the current lease expires in fall 2024.

==Mascot==
The team mascot is a large bee named Bumble.

==Media==
All Salt Lake Bees games are streamed on milb.tv. In Salt Lake, Bees games are broadcast locally on radio station KZNS. Beginning in 2024, Weekend home games began being locally telecasted by KMYU. Tony Parks is the voice of the Bees, inheriting that position in 2024 following the retirement of longtime voice Steve Klauke, who passed away suddenly in June 2024.

<text>Laila Amaria Ali (born December 30, 1977) is an American television personality and retired professional boxer who competed from 1999 to 2007. During her career, from which she retired undefeated, she held the WBC, WIBA, IWBF and IBA female super middleweight titles, and the IWBF light heavyweight title. Ali is widely regarded by many within the sport as one of the greatest female professional boxers of all time. She is the daughter of boxer Muhammad Ali.

==Early life==
Laila Amaria Ali was born December 30, 1977, in Miami Beach, Florida, the daughter of boxer Muhammad Ali and his third wife, Veronica Porché. Her parents divorced when she was nine years old. She was raised as a Muslim, but later left Islam despite her father&#x27;s initial disapproval. Ali was a manicurist at age 16. Her turbulent childhood of arrests and abuse led to her to living in a group home for girls. She graduated from California&#x27;s Santa Monica College with a business degree. She owned her own nail salon before she began boxing. According to Ali, her father opposed her decision to become a boxer due to his Muslim faith; in an interview she said, &quot;My father first of all, did not believe that women should be boxing. My father was Muslim, I&#x27;m not. He was a little bit of a male chauvinist in a way.&quot;

==Boxing career==
Ali began boxing when she was 18 years old, after having first noticed women&#x27;s boxing when watching a Christy Martin fight. She first publicized her decision to become a professional boxer in a &quot;Good Morning America&quot; interview with Diane Sawyer. When she first told her father, Muhammad Ali that she was planning to box professionally, he was unhappy about her entering such a dangerous profession. In her first match, on October 8, 1999, the , , 21-year-old Ali boxed April Fowler of Michigan City, Indiana. They fought at the Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino on the Oneida Indian Nation in Verona, New York. Although this was Ali&#x27;s first match, many journalists and fans attended, largely because she was Muhammad Ali&#x27;s daughter.

Attention to Ali&#x27;s ring debut was further boosted because it occurred on the eve of what was supposed to be the first male-female professional bout ever to be sanctioned by a US state boxing commission – later ruled an exhibition. As WomenBoxing.com explains: &quot;The near-alignment of the two events focused more attention on female professional boxing than there had been since Christy Martin&#x27;s 1996 pay-per-view fight with Deirdre Gogarty.&quot; Ali knocked out Fowler – described by WomenBoxing.com as an &quot;out-of-shape novice&quot; – in the first round. Ali also won her second match by a TKO with only 3 seconds left on the clock. In that match her opponent was 5&#x27;4&quot; Shadina Pennybaker, from Pittsburgh, who was making a pro debut after earning a 2–1 record as an amateur. They fought at the Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort in Chester, West Virginia.

Ali captured nine wins in a row and many boxing fans expressed a desire to see her square off in a boxing ring with George Foreman&#x27;s daughter, Freeda Foreman, or Joe Frazier&#x27;s daughter, Jacqui Frazier-Lyde. On the evening of June 8, 2001, Ali and Frazier finally met. The fight was nicknamed &quot;Ali/Frazier IV&quot; in allusion to their fathers&#x27; famous fight trilogy. Ali won by a majority judges&#x27; decision in eight rounds (79–73, 77–75, 76–76). Frazier-Lyde ended the fight with a swollen eye while Ali had a fractured left collarbone and a bloodied nose. This match by Ali and Frazier was the first main-event pay-per-view match between two women. After a year&#x27;s hiatus, on June 7, 2002, Ali beat Shirvelle Williams in a six-round decision.
She won the IBA title with a second-round knockout of Suzette Taylor on August 17, 2002, in Las Vegas. On November 8, she retained that title and unified the crown by adding the WIBA and IWBF belts with an eight-round TKO win over her division&#x27;s other world champion, Valerie Mahfood, in Las Vegas. Ali stopped a bloodied Mahfood in eight rounds. On June 21, 2003, Mahfood and Ali fought a rematch, this time in Los Angeles. Once again bloodied by Ali, Mahfood lost by TKO in six rounds while trying to recover her world title. Nevertheless, Ali suffered a bad cut on her right eyelid for the first time in her career, inflicted by Mahfood. Ali also suffered a bloodied nose for the second time in her career during this fight, the first being in Ali&#x27;s fight with Frazier-Lyde two years previously. On August 23, 2003, Ali fought her original inspiration, Christy Martin, beating Martin by a knockout in four rounds. On July 17, 2004, Ali retained her world title, knocking out Nikki Eplion in four rounds.

On July 30, 2004, she stopped Monica Nunez in nine rounds, in her father&#x27;s native city of Louisville, Kentucky. This fight was part of the undercard for the fight in which Mike Tyson was surprisingly knocked out by fringe contender Danny Williams. On September 24, 2004, Ali added the IWBF Light Heavyweight title to her resume by beating Gwendolyn O&#x27;Neil (whom she had earlier canceled a fight against) by a knockout in three rounds, at Atlanta, Georgia. On February 1, 2005, in Atlanta, Ali scored a commanding and decisive eighth-round technical knockout over Cassandra Geiggar in a ten-round fight.

On June 11, 2005, on the undercard to the Tyson-Kevin McBride fight, Ali defeated Erin Toughill in round three to remain undefeated and won the World Boxing Council title in addition to defending her WIBA crown. She was the second woman to win a WBC title (Jackie Nava was the first). Toughill and Ali disliked each other, and prior to the fight Toughill joked about Ali. Ali promised she would punish Toughill, much like her father did with Ernie Terrell back in 1967. On December 17, 2005, in Berlin, Ali fought and defeated Åsa Sandell by TKO in the fifth round. Following Ali&#x27;s hard right to Sandell&#x27;s face with 17 seconds remaining in Round 5, Sandell was struck by numerous undefended shots to her head. The referee stopped the bout with 12 seconds remaining. Muhammad Ali was in attendance and kissed his daughter.

While a guest on &quot;Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith&quot; on June 7, 2006, Ali announced that she would be making a world tour, and said that she was looking forward to fighting Ann Wolfe in October 2006. However, the fight with Wolfe never materialized. Instead, on November 11, 2006, Ali fought and defeated Shelley Burton by TKO in the fourth round. Ali was rescheduled to fight O&#x27;Neil in Cape Town, on August 5, 2006, but Ali pulled out amid allegations of fraud. The match eventually took place in South Africa on February 2, 2007. Ali defeated O&#x27;Neil in the first-round by technical knockout. It was Ali&#x27;s last professional fight.

<text>Gaston is a Belgian gag-a-day comic strip created in 1957 by the Belgian cartoonist André Franquin in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot;. The series focuses on the everyday life of Gaston Lagaffe (whose surname means &quot;the blunder&quot;), a lazy and accident-prone office junior who works at &quot;Spirou&quot;&#x27;s office in Brussels. Gaston is very popular in large parts of Europe (especially in Belgium and France) and has been translated into over a dozen languages, but except for a few pages by Fantagraphics in the early 1990s (as &quot;Gomer Goof&quot;), there was no English translation until Cinebook began publishing English language editions of Gaston books (again named &#x27;Gomer Goof&#x27;) in July, 2017.

Since the 1980s Gaston has appeared on a wide variety of merchandise.

== Publication history ==

André Franquin who was then in charge of &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;, the primary series of &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, first introduced the character Gaston in issue n°985, published February 28, 1957. The picture above is found on the 5th page of the magazine in segment of the story, &quot;Le Piano à Bretelles&quot; (written by Paul Berna and illustrated by Morris) which only contains letters and large images. The initial purpose was to fill up empty spaces in the magazine and offer a (comically artificial) glimpse of life behind-the-scenes at the paper. His arrival was carefully orchestrated with a teasing campaign over several months, based on ideas by Franquin, Yvan Delporte and Jidéhem, with mysterious blue footprints in the margins of the magazine.

For the &quot;Spirou&quot; issue N°1000 cover, Franquin drew 999 heads of Spirou, and one of Gaston, and the first &quot;Gaston&quot; full-page gag was featured in a bonus supplement.

In the context of the fictive story evolving at the magazine offices, the man behind the footprints, Gaston, finally turned up for a memorable job interview, telling the bemused Spirou that he didn&#x27;t remember with whom or for what he had been called. Fantasio, functioning as the magazine&#x27;s opinionated face of signed editorials, subsequently announced in a formal communiqué that Gaston would be the first &quot;Hero-without-a-job&quot;. Gaston&#x27;s blunders continued during a stressful and frustrating period for Fantasio, pushing him to go on a 4-week strike and eventually a vacation, initiating the story &quot;Vacances sans histoires&quot;.

From &quot;Spirou&quot; issue n°1025, the single-panel gags were replaced with &quot;Gaston&quot; strips running at the bottom of the editor&#x27;s pages, signed by both Jidéhem and Franquin. These ran until 1959 when Gaston acquired a weekly half-page, which lasted until the mid-60s when the &quot;Gaston Lagaffe&quot; gags grew to full-page.
A full length comic featuring Gaston has not yet been published in English. In 1971 4 gags of Gaston were published in the Thunderbirds Annual 1971. Gaston was christened Cranky Franky for this series. In the early 1990s Fantagraphics translated about a half a dozen gags into English and Gaston was rechristened Gomer Goof for this one.

===&quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; appearances===

Gaston&#x27;s first cameo in a &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; adventure took place in &quot;Spirou&quot; issue n°1014 (19 September 1957) as he graced two frames of &quot;Le voyageur du Mésozoïque&quot; (French: &quot;The Traveller from the Mesozoic Era&quot;). He is first seen &quot;on the streets of the capital&quot; riding a bicycle while reading a newspaper, obliviously littering papers, and then appears two frames later, bruised and dazed, dragging his deformed bike, having ridden into the middle of ongoing traffic.

His second cameo occurred in the early panels of the story &quot;Vacances sans histoires&quot; (&quot;fr:&quot; &quot;Quiet Holidays&quot;) (later included in the album &quot;Le gorille a bonne mine&quot;) which was published between November 1957 and January 1958. Gaston appears at the start of the story when, cycling and lighting a cigarette at the same time, he runs past a red light and very nearly gets hit by Spirou and Fantasio&#x27;s &quot;Turbot I&quot; sportscar. Towards the end, he is again cycling, this time down the wrong way of a one-way street, when he actually gets hit by the new &quot;Turbot II&quot;. More surprised than anything else, stretched out on the front of the car, he simply tells Spirou and Fantasio that they are requested back at the &quot;Spirou&quot; offices.

Gaston was given a larger part in the following adventure, &quot;La Foire aux gangsters&quot; (&quot;The Gangster&#x27;s Fair&quot;, included in the book &quot;Le nid des Marsupilamis&quot;). Here, Gaston hinders Spirou&#x27;s investigation into a baby&#x27;s kidnapping. Spirou&#x27;s search leads him to a fairground and Gaston, who just happens to be there, keeps approaching him. When Spirou, desperate to keep a low profile, whispers to Gaston that they &quot;don&#x27;t know each other&quot;, he keeps insisting that they do or else suggesting that it is Spirou who looks like someone he knows. When Spirou recovers the baby, the kidnappers approach Gaston, who they know was previously talking to Spirou, and he, quite innocently, offers to show them the way to Spirou&#x27;s house for what he thinks will be a pleasant social evening. Fortunately for Spirou and the little victim, Gaston keeps getting his directions wrong and he and the gangsters end up in a dead-end, surrounded by police and in jail. In the final frame (of the book version) Gaston is released from prison, to the scornful glances of the passing public.

In 1961, Franquin and Yvan Delporte wrote a radio serial &quot;Les Robinsons du rail&quot; (French for &quot;The Railway Robinsons&quot;). In this story, Fantasio is sent to cover the inauguration of the first nuclear powered train and, since no one else is available, is compelled to take Gaston with him for assistance. Needless to say, with Gaston on board, things start to go wrong and the train is soon speeding out of control, leaving Spirou and the train designer the task of sorting things out. The serial was broadcast on Belgian radio in 1961. It was later published in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine in 1964 and as a book, but in text form with Franquin and Jidéhem contributing just a few illustrations.

Gaston also appeared in Franquin&#x27;s two final &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; stories, published in &quot;Panade à Champignac&quot;. He is featured in the opening pages of the title story, and plays a central role in &quot;Bravo les Brothers&quot; in which he offers Fantasio a troupe of performing chimpanzees as an unwanted birthday present.

Gaston does not appear in &quot;QRN sur Bretzelburg&quot; (published in 1961-63), but in one scene Fantasio is about to endure painful agony by torturers in a totalitarian state. He thus decides that the best thing to do is to focus on emptiness and think of Gaston.

Jean-Claude Fournier succeeded Franquin as artist and writer of the &quot;Spirou and Fantasio&quot; series with &quot;Le faiseur d&#x27;or&quot;, published in 1969. Kidnapped by gangsters, leading scientist the Count of Champignac is forced by them to come up with a means of helping them with their plans. Thinking of Gaston, he comes up with the kind of recipe that the office idiot would devise, but the resulting and disgusting mixture does have the results that the gangsters wanted, much to the Count&#x27;s annoyance.

When Tome and Janry took over the series a couple of references to Gaston were made in the album &quot;La jeunesse de Spirou&quot; (Spirou&#x27;s youth) where a scam artist is publishing a faux number five album of the Gaston series. And during the tale about Spirou&#x27;s childhood Gaston&#x27;s car is seen parked in front of the publishing company.

More recently a reference to Gaston was made in the album &quot;Aux sources du Z&quot; (The source of Z) by Morvan and Munuera, when Spirou uses the time shifting machine he remarks that the experience is yucky, almost as bad as the Champagne that Gaston made out of fermented potatoes. Later in that album when Spirou has to use the time shifter once more he remarks that it&#x27;s time to take a sip from Gaston&#x27;s Champagne again.

===Focus on &quot;Gaston&quot;===
For a period, Franquin had trained his assistant Jidéhem to take over the strip in due time, but Jidéhem felt no affinity with the character and remained the background artist. Franquin inversely grew tired of &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; (a series he had not created himself, but inherited from Joseph &quot;Jijé&quot; Gillain in 1946) and decided in 1968 to resign the job, and concentrate on the increasingly popular &quot;Gaston&quot;. Gaston&#x27;s antics appeared in &quot;Spirou&quot; from 1957 to 1996, a few months before Franquin&#x27;s death in 1997, although new material appeared only sporadically after the early 1980s.

== Format and appeal ==
&quot;Gaston Lagaffe&quot; follows the classic &quot;gag&quot; format of Franco-Belgian comics: one-page stories (initially half-a-page) with an often visual punchline, sometimes foreshadowed in the dialogue. The humour mixes slapstick, puns and running gags. Franquin&#x27;s style is characterised by extremely nervous characters and action and very quotable dialogue. The series is much loved not only for its perfectly timed comedy, but also for its warm outlook on everyday life. Although Gaston works at &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine and one of his colleagues is a cartoonist, the series satirises office life in general rather than the publishing or comics business; Franquin himself worked at home.
In the later episodes, the reader could discover a visual reference to the story in Franquin&#x27;s signature at the bottom of the page.

== Characters ==

=== Gaston Lagaffe ===
Gaston was hired - somewhat mysteriously - as an office junior at the offices of the &quot;Journal de Spirou&quot; (the real-life publication in which the strip appeared), having wandered in cluelessly. The strip usually focuses on his efforts to avoid doing any work, and indulge instead in hobbies or naps while all around him panic over deadlines, lost mail and contracts. Initially, Gaston was an irritating simpleton, but he developed a genial personality and a sense of humour. Common sense however always eludes him, and he has an almost supernatural ability to cause disasters (&quot;gaffes&quot;) to which he reacts with his catchphrase: &quot;M&#x27;enfin?!&quot; (&quot;What the...?&quot;). His job involves chiefly dealing with readers&#x27; mail. The ever-growing piles of unanswered letters (&quot;courrier en retard&quot;) and the attempts of Fantasio and Léon Prunelle to make him deal with it or to retrieve documentation are recurring themes of the comic.

Gaston&#x27;s age is a mystery – Franquin himself confessed that he neither knew nor indeed wanted to know it. Although Gaston has a job, a car and his own place, he often acts like a young teenager. In the publication of Dossier Franquin Franquin had said that Gaston is a boy in his late teens but certainly not in his twenties. He is invariably dressed in a tight polo-necked green jumper and blue-jeans, and worn-out espadrilles. It is said that his appearance was originally based on that of Yvan Delporte, editor of the &quot;Journal de Spirou&quot; at that time. Also, in his first gags, Gaston was an avid cigarette smoker, but his habit was slowly phased out.

Gaston alternates between phases of extreme laziness, when it is near impossible to wake him up, and hyper-activity, when he creates various machines or plays with office furniture. Over the years, he has experimented with cooking, rocket science, music, electronics, decorating, telecommunication, chemistry and many other hobbies, all with uniformly catastrophic results. His Peter Pan-like refusal to grow up and care about his work makes him very endearing, while his antics account for half the stress experienced by his unfortunate co-workers.

Gaston&#x27;s disregard for authority or even public safety are not confined to his office — they occasionally threaten the entire city. He is not above covering road signs with advertising posters or even snowmen, reasoning that it is the only decent use that they have — being oblivious to the chaos and accidents that covering the road signs cause.

====Gaston&#x27;s pets====
Gaston is very fond of animals (as was Franquin of drawing them) and keeps several pets. The main ones are a depressed, aggressive seagull and a hyperactive cat. Like Franquin&#x27;s most famous animal creation, the Marsupilami, those two never acquired a name and are just referred to as the cat and the seagull. Gaston also sometimes keeps a mouse (Cheese), and a goldfish (Bubulle). The animals are sometimes Gaston&#x27;s partners in crime, sometimes the victims of his clumsiness and sometimes the perpetrators of nefarious schemes. They are depicted more realistically than the pets in Spirou, in that we are not privy to their inner thoughts. The cat and seagull in particular can be fairly vicious, to the extent of forcing all employees and an unwilling De Mesmaeker to wear helmets, but never to Gaston himself. They often team up to obtain food. For example, in volume 14, the seagull distracts the fishmonger while the cat steals a fish, which they later eat together.

=== The office co-workers ===
Fantasio, a character originally hailing from the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; series, is the first main supporting character and irritable straight man to Gaston in the early part of the series. Franquin acknowledged with regret that he had totally destroyed the original clown-like personality of the character by using him in this role, which required him to be formal and businesslike and behave as an authority figure. In &quot;Gaston&quot;, instead of having adventures and doing some reporting, Fantasio has an editorial role in the magazine and, as such, is burdened with the impossible task of trying to make Gaston actually do some work. He is the main character&#x27;s hierarchical superior, often seen trying to sign contracts with Monsieur De Mesmaeker.

His job in this series could be described as that of an office manager. In opposition to his role in &quot;Spirou&quot;, in &quot;Gaston&quot;, Fantasio was a comically serious character, a regular victim of Gaston&#x27;s goofy antics who thus became to Fantasio what Fantasio is to Spirou. 
His seriousness and stress plays the opposite of Gaston&#x27;s carefree and relaxed attitude towards life and work. Although he appears to be mostly on friendly terms with Gaston, his underling&#x27;s chaotic behaviour often makes him lose his temper. On occasion, he becomes aggressive and tries to get even by pranking and hazing Gaston.

By the time the album &quot;Bravo les Brothers&quot; came out (which, while nominally a &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; story, was effectively hijacked by Gaston), it was decided that it was time for Fantasio to leave. When Fournier took over the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; series in 1970, Fantasio was essentially removed from &quot;Gaston&quot;. At first, he made the occasional guest appearance, even once returning to the office itself, his absence explained as being away in Champignac. Otherwise, from 1970 onwards, he gradually disappears from the series as Franquin abandoned &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; to devote himself solely to &quot;Gaston&quot;, appearing for the last time in gag n ° 551 (and with a cameo in gag 662 as a prehistoric hunter). His role as the office&#x27;s authority figure is completely taken over by Léon Prunelle.

Spirou of &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; was a fairly major supporting character in the comic&#x27;s very early days, though his role was quickly reduced to occasional appearances. He was on generally friendly terms with Gaston, sometimes trying to mediate between him and Fantasio, usually without much success. Like Fantasio, he vanished entirely from the comic when Franquin stopped drawing &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;.

Léon Prunelle, an editor at the &quot;Journal de Spirou&quot;. He has black hair, a short beard and wears glasses. Originally a background character without much detail and a relatively calm demeanor, Prunelle eventually takes up the role of office supervisor when Fantasio is removed as a regular character. He is then revealed to be even more short-tempered than his predecessor from whom he has inherited not only the mammoth task of making Gaston work, but also the job of signing contracts with important businessman Aimé De Mesmaeker (see below). Initially optimistic about this, Prunelle slowly realizes that he cannot win. However he refuses to give up and sometimes resorts to drastic measures, such as locking up Gaston in the cellar or even a cupboard.

Prunelle comes across as a tortured person who will end up having a nervous breakdown from taking everything too seriously . Perpetually at the end of his tether, he is constantly running around barking angry orders, turns a nasty reddish purple when disaster strikes and regularly utters his trademark outburst &quot;Rogntudju!&quot; (a mangled version of &quot;Nom de Dieu&quot;, roughly the equivalent of &quot;bloody hell&quot;, which was unacceptable in a children&#x27;s comic when the strip was originally published). Often a victim of Gaston&#x27;s inventions and projects, his efforts to counter his subordinate&#x27;s laziness and carefree attitude leave him at the brink of exhaustion and violent rage attacks. A large portion of Prunelle&#x27;s time is spent chasing Gaston around and to remind him that he has to deal with late mail, prevent him from taking unnecessary naps or breaks and to stop him from using office hours for cooking, tinkering, inventing and, of course, goofing around.

In short, Prunelle&#x27;s role is that of the comically ineffective authority figure, constantly frustrated by Gaston&#x27;s shenanigans. Occasionally, he manages to turn the tables on Gaston, preventing him from causing chaos or actually pranking him and showing that he is not without a sense of humor.

Yves Lebrac, (first presented with the name Yvon Lebrac), an in-house cartoonist, is comparatively laid-back. He is fond of puns and we see him woo (and eventually win) one of the attractive secretary girls over the course of the series. Although mostly on good terms with Gaston (unlike Prunelle), he occasionally loses his temper when deadlines loom and Gaston&#x27;s interference becomes too much. When not a victim of &quot;gaffes&quot;, he is a lenient comrade of Gaston, and the character with which Franquin himself most identified. 

Joseph Boulier, a surly accountant for &quot;Éditions Dupuis&quot;, the publishers of the magazine. He states that he will not rest until he has tracked down every useless expense in the company, and in particular those of Gaston. However, his attempts to cause Gaston grief backfire in spectacular ways. He represents the more serious side of the comics publishing business.

Mademoiselle Jeanne (&quot;M&#x27;oiselle Jeanne&quot; to Gaston), one of the magazine&#x27;s secretaries, is Gaston&#x27;s love interest. A short redhead with freckles, glasses, a conservative dress style and very long hair, she was first depicted as comically unattractive in a gag where Gaston needs a partner for the back end of his pantomime horse costume and chooses Jeanne because of her ponytail. However, in the following appearances, she increasingly becomes prettier and more attractive, if never really a conventional beauty queen: her body changes from pear-shaped to curvaceous, she pays more attention to her makeup and her long hair, her dress style gradually switches to modern (and often revealing) outfits and she becomes more confident in her interactions with Gaston and other characters.

Jeanne is a perfect match for Gaston. She wholeheartedly admires his talent, courage and inventiveness and is utterly oblivious to his lack of common sense — of which she herself has fairly little. However their courtship seems perpetually stuck at the very first step. They address each other with the formal &quot;vous&quot; and as &quot;Mister&quot; and &quot;Miss&quot; and see each other mainly at the office — though they have the occasional outing together. This platonic relationship, in a way, is in keeping with Gaston&#x27;s refusal or inability to grow up. It is revealed in the album &quot;En direct de la gaffe&quot; that Jeanne is color blind: she can&#x27;t tell green from red. She also still lives with her mother and, although it is assumed that she is well beyond her teens, is shown grounded after a row.

As the comic strip progresses, Gaston&#x27;s love for Jeanne becomes more obvious. During his office naps, his daydreams about her become increasingly explicit and erotically charged. In one of the series&#x27; final stories, Gaston and Jeanne are actually seen holding hands in public, hinting at a more intimate and serious relationship.
 To the dismay of critics, Franquin only sporadically actually drew them naked, with Gaston in a state of arousal, on several unpublished sketches and commercially unavailable greeting cards.

Monsieur Dupuis (the real-life publisher Jean Dupuis) himself has made two appearances - both times we only see his legs.

Spirou is also staffed by the Van Schrijfboek brothers: the mustached translator Bertje and the red-haired editor Jef, cleaning lady Mélanie Molaire (who always fumes at the mess left by Gaston and which she has to clean up), concierge Jules Soutier, and a string of attractive secretaries named Sonia (who is constantly handing in her notice), Yvonne and Suzanne. Occasionally, real-life figures from the Journal de Spirou (such as editor Yvan Delporte or writer Raoul Cauvin) have cameos.

=== Friends ===
Jules-de-chez-Smith-en-face (Jules-from-Smith&#x27;s-across-the-street) is one of Gaston&#x27;s friends. He &quot;works&quot; (much in the same way as Gaston &quot;works&quot;) in the office just across the street from the &quot;Journal de Spirou&quot;, prompting countless attempts at cross-street communication via walkie-talkie, flash card, carrier seagull, etc. Jules shares Gaston&#x27;s childish enthusiasm, and is his sidekick in many ventures. Although they are close, Jules addresses Gaston as &quot;Lagaffe&quot;.

Bertrand Labévue is another of Gaston&#x27;s friends/sidekicks, and (in translated editions) also his cousin. As his name indicates (&quot;bévue&quot; means &quot;blunder&quot;), he shares Gaston&#x27;s tendency to goof up. Bertrand suffers from acute depression, mirroring Franquin&#x27;s own problems with the illness, and Gaston and Jules do their best to cheer him up with food, country drives and other things (all of which backfire comically).

Manu is another friend, who regularly turns up in different jobs (like Bert in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;): chimney sweep, sewer worker, installer of street signage... He also partakes in Gaston&#x27;s schemes to irritate Longtarin, the policeman.

=== Foes ===
Aimé De Mesmaeker is a rich businessman; we know that he owns a private jet (until Gaston destroys it) and that his oldest daughter drives an Alfa Romeo. His precise line of business is unknown, but he is repeatedly lured into the offices of Spirou by Fantasio or Prunelle in order to sign some lucrative contracts. De Mesmaeker has developed a deep loathing for Gaston and by extension his colleagues. His frequent visits allow Franquin to satirise business rituals, as Dupuis&#x27;s employees shower him with attention, complimentary drinks and cigars, but De Mesmaeker almost inevitably ends up storming out of the offices, swearing never to set foot in them again, passed out on the floor or even in hospital due to Gaston&#x27;s catastrophic blunders.

De Mesmaeker is named after Jean De Mesmaeker (known as Jidéhem from the French pronunciation of his initials J.D.M.), Franquin&#x27;s collaborator on the series; he remarked that the character looked like his own father. The real-life Mr De Mesmaeker Sr — actually a salesman — soon found that, as Gaston&#x27;s strip became increasingly popular, concluding a deal would result in the client asking, &quot;Where are the contracts?&quot; (a recurring catchphrase in the comics).

Joseph Longtarin (&quot;long nose&quot;) is a policeman working in the neighbourhood where the offices of &quot;Spirou&quot; are located. One of his particular responsibilities is to handle traffic and illegal parking. An exceptionally petty and vengeful man, he is the closest thing the series has to a villain. He is one of Gaston&#x27;s favorite &quot;victims&quot; as well as his nemesis. The two clash continually over Gaston&#x27;s car and parking habits. Gaston retaliates for Longtarin&#x27;s repeated attempts to ticket him by wreaking havoc on the neighbourhood&#x27;s parking meters (not just a bugbear of Gaston, but of André Franquin too). He pulls off other pranks, such as putting a small effigy of Longtarin on the front of his car, in a parody of the Rolls-Royce Spirit of Ecstasy.

Ducran &amp; Lapoigne (“Courage &amp; Stronghold”) is an engineering firm (specializing in steel bridges) whose offices neighbour those of Dupuis. This company is also a frequent victim of Lagaffe&#x27;s mishaps and Fantasio or Prunelle often bear the brunt of Ducran and Lapoigne&#x27;s anger—both of them being big muscular men, as their names suggest.

Freddy-les-doigts-de-fée (&quot;fairy-fingered Freddy&quot;) is a burglar. His occasional break-ins at &quot;Spirou&quot; are always foiled accidentally by Gaston, who tends to inadvertently leave dangerous objects, devices or pets around the office. Workers at &quot;Spirou&quot; see Freddy as a fellow victim of Gaston, and, instead of turning him in to the police, offer him comfort and freebies when they find him in the morning.

== Props, inventions and other running gags ==
Objects play an important part in Gaston&#x27;s life, and some of them have become iconic enough to be sometimes recreated in real life for exhibitions and such. The main two are:

===Gaston&#x27;s car===

Gaston drives an old Fiat 509, which he acquires in gag #321, decorated with racing patterns that he added himself. However its top speed still allows passengers to safely pick flowers on motorway verges. Much humour derives from the car&#x27;s extreme state of decrepitude; for example, a friend of Gaston is able to &quot;waterski&quot; behind it on a slick of oil, while Gaston strenuously denies any such leaks. The car also produces huge quantities of (often toxic) smoke, even more so when Gaston converts it to run on coal. Customisations and ill-fitted upgrades include:
* An emissions filter fitted to the exhaust pipe which turns out not to let &quot;anything&quot; through, causing the exhaust to come in the front.
* A bag in which exhaust fumes are collected. Unfortunately, Gaston thoughtlessly empties the bag in a busy street, rendering everyone unconscious.
* Snow chains.
* A snow-plough device that sucks the snow into a heater, which, instead of evaporating the snow, fills the passenger compartment, freezing the occupants.
* Seatbelts, which accidentally wrap around the rear axle.
* An airbag which smothers the driver (Prunelle claims it allows a less messy death in case of accident).
* A wind turbine that peels apart the car&#x27;s roof, flying away with Prunelle dangling underneath.

The car is inadvertently rocket-powered on two separate occasions.

Some of Gaston&#x27;s colleagues are terrified at the very thought of sitting in the Fiat – Prunelle swears on several occasions that he will never set foot in it again. The car is also the source of many clashes with Longtarin, as Gaston endlessly devises schemes to avoid paying parking meters, even going as far as parking it up in a tree or faking roadworks.

===The Gaffophone===

This extraordinary instrument, a prehistoric-looking combination of horn and harp created by Gaston, produces a sound so terrible and loud that it causes physical destruction all around and panics animals and even fighter jet pilots. Like the voice of the bard Cacofonix in &quot;Asterix&quot;, it horrifies everyone except its originator. The first time the instrument appears, the plucking of just one string causes the floor to collapse. Gaston has also created at least one other instrument in the same vein, and an electric version of the Gaffophone. Fantasio has tried several times to get rid of the Gaffophone, without success.

An illustrated text published in the &quot;Journal de Spirou&quot; column &quot;En direct de la Rédaction&quot; (and later collected in &quot;Gaston&quot; nº 10), chronicled (from the viewpoint of Prunelle) the Gaffophone&#x27;s blossoming and development into a small ecosystem, which then self-destructed. Gaston later rebuilt his instrument.

===Costumes===
An early running gag involved Gaston coming up with elaborate and extremely impractical costumes for fancy dress parties at the facetious suggestions of his colleagues: Roly-poly toy, octopus, Greek urn, petrol pump, Eiffel Tower etc. He was invariably worried about whether he would be able to dance with the outfit on. Once, he dressed as the Marsupilami.

===Other inventions===
These have included:
* A necktie- / shoelace-tying device, which respectively strangled Fantasio and ripped off De Mesmaeker&#x27;s trousers.
* A ceiling-suspended table, which caused Fantasio to trip on the supports upstairs.
* A self-heating duffle coat, for which a plumber was called when it sprung a leak.
* A rotating Christmas tree, which ended up rotating fast enough to turn the ornaments into dangerous projectiles.
* A pneumatic ashtray, which promptly sucked in De Mesmaeker&#x27;s contracts.
* An electric scarecrow, with badly insulated wires that ended up shocking the farmer.
* A folding bicycle, which promptly folded around Gaston as he was demonstrating it.
* A remote-controlled electric iron, which wreaked havoc on the office before hitting De Mesmaeker&#x27;s face.
* A mini-lawnmower, to mow his aunt&#x27;s lawn without hurting the daisies.
* A suit of armour for mice, for when his cat and his mouse learned to live together.
* A solar-powered flashlight.
* An electric cigar cutter shaped like a guillotine, which almost worked like a guillotine for the users&#x27; fingers.
* An automatic hammer, the inevitable &quot;gaffe&quot; being that you first had to nail it to the wall.
* A seatbelt made of rubber, for easy access to the mailbox from the car.
* A coffeemaker which produces so stiff a drink, it renders the drinker (Gaston himself and De Mesmaeker) hyperenergetic, agitated and utterly unable to use even a pen without destroying it.
* Adding ground coffee to the central heating boiler, so that hot coffee can be extracted from every radiator in the building, but with a flavour of heating oil.
* A tanning umbrella, to tan when it is raining. It gives Gaston a sunburn in the middle of rainy, cold weather.
* A perpetual motion machine that serves no purpose than to annoy the rest of the office.

===The mail backlog===
The task most often given to Gaston by Prunelle is to sort and answer the mail, presumably sent by readers. This often builds up to a mountain-like backlog, which Gaston often attempts to dispose of in creative ways, for instance stuffing a homemade sofa with it. In a similar vein, Gaston was briefly put in charge of the reference library: at first he arranged the books into a maze and charged his colleagues for admission, and later he simply piled them up, dug a cave in the middle and settled there with his pets, a radio and a stove to sleep all day.

===De Mesmaeker&#x27;s contracts===
This is possibly the most frequent running gag in the series, and by Franquin&#x27;s admission a MacGuffin: &quot;Whatever&#x27;s in the contracts is irrelevant. What we want to see is how Gaston will prevent them from being signed.&quot;

Aimé De Mesmaeker is a hot-tempered businessman who often visits the office (which he increasingly, and with some justification, sees as a madhouse) in order to sign some important contracts. However, the contracts are irrevocably jinxed: before De Mesmaeker can apply pen to paper, Gaston&#x27;s latest gimmick comes along, provokes mayhem and causes the hapless businessman to storm out, rip the contracts up, or in some cases pass out. Even when they do get signed, Gaston can always be counted on to accidentally destroy them.

Over the years, Fantasio and Prunelle&#x27;s efforts to get the iconic contracts signed become increasingly frantic and desperate. Prunelle even goes so far as to send Lagaffe to the other side of town on some wild goose chase or bound and gag him and lock him into a cupboard but even these drastic measures backfire and fail.

On two occasions, De Mesmaeker actually ended up signing other contracts with Gaston spontaneously, instead of &quot;the&quot; contracts, both merchandising deals over Gaston&#x27;s inventions (the &quot;Cosmo-clock&quot;, an Apollo spacecraft-shaped cuckoo clock, and a soup recipe).

==Politics, activism and promotional material==
Authors at &quot;Spirou&quot; could only go so far in expressing anything resembling politics within the magazine, and so the author of &quot;Gaston&quot; generally stuck to a gentle satire of productivity and authority. However, the pacifism and concern for the environment that formed the basis of Franquin&#x27;s politics and would be expressed much more bluntly in &quot;Idées noires&quot; were already surfacing in &quot;Gaston&quot; (and &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;). Very occasionally, Franquin stepped over the mark, as in an uncharacteristically angry strip where Gaston uses a toy Messerschmitt plane to strafe the whole office in protest at their (real life) appearance in the magazine&#x27;s modelling column (while building the model, he says: “&quot;… and now, the swastikas. They are very popular amongst idiots&quot;”). Outside of &quot;Spirou&quot; however, Franquin had a free rein, and used Gaston in promotional material for diverse organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In the former, activists scare whales away from whalers by plucking the dreaded gaffophone. For the latter, Franquin produced a gut-wrenching sequence where Gaston is beaten and tortured and forced to watch M&#x27;oiselle Jeanne raped in front of him, before being sent to a prison camp. In the penultimate frame he faces capital punishment which the punters hope &quot;serves as an example&quot;. Awaking in a sweat, Gaston shouts at the reader that &quot;although this was a nightmare, it&#x27;s happening right now around the world&quot;, urging membership.

Gaston has also appeared in advertising campaigns for batteries, a soft drink (Orange Piedboeuf), and in a campaign to promote bus use. The material was always drawn by Franquin himself rather than under licence, and has been reprinted in books. The latter campaign is interesting in that it shows Franquin&#x27;s evolution from car enthusiast inventing the &quot;Turbo-traction&quot; and other fancy sports vehicles for &quot;Spirou&quot; in the 1950s, to disillusioned citizen concerned over traffic and pollution in later years. One topical strip had the seagull boycotting Gaston&#x27;s car after seeing a bird stuck in an oil spill on television. &quot;Life is becoming more and more complicated&quot;, its owner concludes gloomily in a very rare joke-free ending.

== Albums ==
In 1960 the first &quot;Gaston&quot; book, a small-format (7x13 cm) publication, was released. Its format was so unorthodox that some retailers thought it was a promotional issue to be given away for free. The cover features Gaston wearing orange espadrilles without socks, not yet given his trademark blue espadrilles. Fifteen major albums were published between 1963 and 1996, including all the strips that appeared in &quot;Spirou&quot;. There were some oddities such as number 1 appearing out of sequence and number 0 twenty years later. The first five were quickly sold out; the others were frequently reprinted.

Included in the series were the &quot;R1&quot; through &quot;R5&quot; albums (R for &quot;Réédition&quot;, French for &quot;republication&quot;). The R5 album was not published until 1986; its non-existence until then had been a mystery. This was due to the republication of the real first five books: they were published on a smaller format, and from these small ones they couldn&#x27;t make five big ones. After several years it was decided to fill it up with early unpublished material and some advertising gags for PiedBœuf.

Beginning in 1987, &quot;Éditions J&#x27;ai lu&quot; began publishing a 17-volume series in paperback format. The titles and contents did not exactly match the large-format albums.

In 1996, upon Gaston&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Dupuis and Marsu Productions published &quot;Edition Définitive&quot;, containing nearly all &quot;Gaston&quot; gags in chronological order. As some of the earliest material had been damaged, restoration work was done by Studio Léonardo, with the results approved by Franquin. This edition is being published in Spain by Planeta DeAgostini Comics starting in January 2007.

In 2007, upon Gaston&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Marsu Productions published &quot;Gaston 50&quot;, a new album with unpublished work. The strange number 50 refers to Gaston&#x27;s age but also to the chaotic numbering of the Classic series, which hadn&#x27;t got a number five for a very long time.

For an anniversary album of sixty years of Gaston in 2016, Canadian illustrator Delaf illustrated the cover and drew a gag. This was so well received that he was asked to work on a completely new album. In 2023, 26 years after Franquin&#x27;s death, the new album Gaston 22: Le Retour de Lagaffe! was released.

* A mural painting represents Gaston Lagaffe in the rue des Wallons in Louvain-la-Neuve, based on an original painting by Franquin.

* Between approximately 1990 and 2008, there was also a painting of Gaston at the East Side Gallery in Berlin. It was unauthorized and not an official part of the gallery but was a popular photo motive.
* In honor of Gaston&#x27;s 60th birthday, Manneken Pis wore a suit from Guust Flater during the Brussels Comics Festival in 2017.
* In Charleroi, a statue of Gaston was unveiled on Place Verte on September 17, 2021.

== Film adaptations ==

In 1981, a live-action French film based on &quot;Gaston&quot;, called &quot;Fais gaffe à la gaffe!&quot; directed by Paul Boujenah and starring Roger Mirmont. Future &quot;The Sopranos&quot; star Lorraine Bracco, then residing in France, appears in a supporting role. Franquin, uncomfortable with the prospect of a live adaptation of &quot;Gaston&quot;, had given permission for the elements and jokes from his work to be used, but not the actual characters. As a result, the characters&#x27; names were all changed, making the film appear more like an imitation than a proper adaptation.

In 2009, an animated series of Gaston was broadcast from November 19, created by Normaal Studios. Unable to draw the characters, the animation style were first taken from the actual comic and then animated. This was done to express the feeling of the characters coming to life from the comics. This technique also uses actual shown speech bubbles, panels and even written sound effects. Each episode centered around a different theme and showed about 5 gags similar, from the including Cup-and-ball, experiments, the cactus, pets, etc..

A new adaptation with Théo Fernandez as the titular character, this time called &quot;&quot;, made by and co-starring Pierre-François Martin-Laval was released in 2018.
