<text>The Citroën SM is a high-performance coupé produced by the French manufacturer Citroën from 1970 to 1975. The SM placed third in the 1971 European Car of the Year contest, trailing its stablemate Citroën GS, and won the 1972 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year award in the U.S.

==History==
In 1961, Citroën began work on &#x27;Project S&#x27; – a sports variant of the Citroën DS. As was customary for the firm, many running concept vehicles were developed, increasingly complex and upmarket from the DS. At some stage in the 9-year project, it evolved from developing a faster variant of the 1955 DS to developing an entirely new, thoroughly engineered car – in terms of engineering effort, a replacement for the high volume DS model. Citroën purchased Maserati in 1968 with the intention of harnessing Maserati&#x27;s high-performance engine technology to produce a true Gran Tourer car, combining the sophisticated Citroën suspension with a Maserati V6.

The result was the Citroën SM, first shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1970. It went on sale in France in September of that year. Factory produced cars were all left-hand-drive, although RHD conversions were done in the UK and Australia.

This car was unusual for France – production of luxury cars was heavily restricted in the country by post-World War II &quot;puissance fiscale&quot; horsepower tax, so France had not had a production vehicle in this market sector since before World War II.
The SM had an engine of only 2.7 liters owing to these regulations; it was the first response to the luxury/performance sector since the export oriented Chrysler Hemi V8 engine Facel Vega in the late 1950s. Citroën&#x27;s flagship vehicle competed with high-performance GTs of the time from other nations and manufacturers, such as Jaguar, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Maserati&#x27;s Merak.

The origin of the model name &#x27;SM&#x27; is not completely clear. The &#x27;S&#x27; may derive from the Project &#x27;S&#x27; designation, the aim of which was to produce what is essentially a sports variant of the Citroën DS, and the &#x27;M&#x27; perhaps refers to Maserati, hence SM is often assumed to stand for &quot;Systeme Maserati&quot; or &quot;Sports Maserati&quot;. Another common alternative is &quot;Série Maserati&quot;, but others have suggested it is short for &#x27;Sa Majesté&#x27; (Her Majesty in French), which aligns with the common DS model&#x27;s nickname &#x27;La déesse&#x27; (The Goddess).

The SM did not find a sufficient customer base in the small European GT market, but much of the SM&#x27;s technology was carried forward to the successful Citroën CX, launched in 1974 the DIRAVI steering being the most obvious example. The same basic engine in enlarged 3.0 L form (some in Italy had 2.0 L) was used in Maserati&#x27;s own Merak (1,800 units) and later with some modification in the Biturbo (40,000 units). The Merak, Khamsin, and Bora, used Citroën&#x27;s high-pressure hydraulics for some functions, and the Citroën gearbox in the Merak, during the Citroën-Maserati alliance.

==Performance==
Contemporary automotive journalists were effusive about the SM&#x27;s dynamic qualities, which were unlike anything they had experienced before. The SM provided a combination of comfort, sharp handling, and braking not available in any other car at the time. The magazine &quot;Popular Science&quot; reported that the SM had the shortest stopping distance of any car they had tested.

Automotive journalists marveled at the resulting ability to travel for hours at in comfort. In 1972 &quot;Motorsport&quot; (U.K.) noted ...&quot;that rare quality of being a nice car to be in at any speed, from stationary to maximum.&quot; The touring range based on the SM&#x27;s fuel economy and the large fuel tank made long, fast, relaxing journeys possible.

Because the SM had a smaller engine than competitors, the acceleration was adequate rather than exemplary – some competitors were quicker. Some owners have fitted the similar sized Maserati Merak SS engine, which does improve the driving experience considerably. The fuel consumption compared favorably to its competitors.

==Technical innovations==
The SM combined many unusual and innovative features, some of which were only becoming commonplace on cars manufactured many decades later. It borrowed heavily from the innovations introduced on the DS, by including hydro-pneumatic (oleo pneumatic) self-leveling suspension, and self-leveling lights that swiveled with the steering (except in the United States, where these were illegal at the time).

The SM was Citroën&#x27;s means of demonstrating just how much power and performance could be accommodated in a front-wheel drive design. This was novel, and many technical issues needed to be overcome, especially related to torque steer, where excessive steering feedback affects control of the vehicle.

A solution was found – no road feedback at all – the driver points and goes, regardless of what the driven wheels are experiencing. Hitting a pothole at high speed would not turn the steering wheel in the driver&#x27;s hands.
This new type of variable assist power steering was later fitted to the Citroën CX in large numbers and its basic principle has since spread throughout the vehicle production. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so that the amount of steering feel remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary power assisted steering to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.

If the driver released the steering wheel, then the steering would center back to the straight ahead position. It was geared for minimal steering input – with two turns from lock to lock, it is often described as go kart-like.

Many contemporary reviewers remarked that this system would take at least of driving to become familiar, but once the driver is accustomed to the system, then traditional steering feels old-fashioned.

This steering was controversial at the time – the exaggerated, &quot;strong-arm&quot; steering inputs required in contemporary cars could cause abrupt manoeuvres in the SM. When the SM was cast as a TV series regular on &quot;The Protectors&quot; (1972), the lead actress refused to drive it, because of the familiarization required from the steering.

The &quot;DIRAVI&quot; steering is self-centering and fully powered (as opposed to hydraulically assisted). This feature allows the front wheels to run near-zero caster, and means that there is no camber change as lock is applied, and also ensures that the maximum amount of tyre area is in contact with the road at all times.

The wiper mechanism, when on the &quot;low speed&quot; setting, is &#x27;sensitive&#x27; to rain, by measuring the current needed to drive the wiper motor, while the steering column is adjustable in both height and reach.

The braking system, adapted from the DS, employs disc brakes at all four corners (the DS has drums at the rear), with the front brakes being inboard, and cooled via large ducts on the front underside of the car. The hydraulic braking pressure front to rear balance is self-adjusting according to the weight in the rear of the car, so on hard braking the entire car lowers evenly.

Standard wheels are steel with stainless trims, but for the rigors of off-road racing, Michelin developed a unique solution – a lightweight fiberglass wheel, which became a factory fitted option. These &quot;plastic&quot; wheels weigh less than half the standard weight and were decades in advance of similar applications. Hemmings and others are wrong when mentioning Michelin&#x27;s &quot;Roues Resin&quot; as carbon fiber wheels, the wheels contain glass fibers, not carbon fibers. This is very clear when seeing the backside of the rims. Jalopnik also wrongly states that the wheels are made with carbon fibers 

==Styling==
Designed in-house by Citroën&#x27;s chief designer Robert Opron, the SM bears a family resemblance to the Citroën CX and Citroën GS, and to some extent the Maserati Mistral. Like the CX, the SM retains the rear fender skirts, and seen from above, the SM resembles a teardrop, with a wide front track tapering to a narrower rear track.

The SM was unusually aerodynamic for its era, with a Kamm tail and low drag coefficient. At launch, Citroën claimed a drag coefficient of 0.26, although it later published a revised figure of 0.339. The ventilation intake is located in a &quot;neutral&quot; area on the hood, which makes the ventilator fan regulate the interior ventilation at all road speeds.

With its distinctly modernist influence, the interior styling of the SM is as dramatic as the exterior. The small oval steering wheel is matched by oval gauges. The manual shift lever &#x27;boot&#x27; is a highly stylized chrome gate. The seats are highly adjustable buckets with centre padding composed of many individual &#x27;rolls&#x27;. High-quality materials are used throughout. The bonnet is aircraft grade aluminum, while the external bright work is stainless steel, rather than &#x27;cheaper&#x27; chrome (except for &quot;plastichrome&quot; &quot;SM&quot; trim at the rear base of the rain gutter).

In 1970, it was the fastest front-wheel-drive car, with a factory-quoted top speed of , and independent tests achieving as much as . It was an example of the car as a symbol of optimism and progressive technology, similar to the SM&#x27;s contemporary, the Concorde aircraft.

The SM&#x27;s design placed eleventh on &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;″s 2005 &quot;100 Coolest Cars&quot; listing.

==US exports==
The main export market for the SM was the U.S., where the market for personal luxury cars was much larger than in Europe. Competitors included the Cadillac Eldorado, Lincoln Mark IV and Ford Thunderbird alongside Italian, British, and German imports. The unique design of the SM made quite a splash and won the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award in 1972, unheard of for a non-US vehicle at the time.

The SM&#x27;s system of six replaceable-bulb composite halogen headlamps with swivelling high beams was illegal in the U.S., where regulations at the time required all vehicles to have two or four round sealed-beam headlamps on fixed mounts and with no lens or other covering in front of them. So, SMs for the U.S. market were fitted with four exposed round non-swivelling sealed beams.

Despite initial success, U.S. sales ceased suddenly when Citroën did not receive an expected exemption for the 1974 model year bumper regulation imposed by the NHTSA. The integral variable height suspension of the SM made compliance impossible. The 1974 SMs built for the U.S. market (134 cars), could not be supplied to Americans due to the effective date of the bumper regulation, so were sold in Japan instead.

==Engines==

The SM was sold with a small, lightweight engine in various forms, designed from scratch by Giulio Alfieri but capable of being assembled on the existing tooling for the Maserati V8 engine. Because of this, the engine sported an unusual 90° angle between cylinder banks – a trait shared with the later PRV V6. It was a very compact and innovative design that allowed the use of just one pattern for the cylinder heads and an intermediate shaft extended out to drive the auxiliaries.

The engine was aluminum, weighing just , and was always mounted behind the front axle.

The size of the 2.7 L engine was limited by French puissance fiscale taxation, which made large displacement vehicles too expensive to sell in any quantity in France.

One SM had a Maserati V8 motor – this was a heavily used test bed developed by Maserati for the 1974 Maserati Quattroporte II. Despite developing , the car required relatively modest adjustments, and the performance made the SM into a true sporting car.

One SM had a V6 twin Turbo – developed by specialist Jerry Hathaway (&quot;SM World&quot;) for land speed record testing at Bonneville Salt Flats – achieving .

Smooth shifting 5-speed manual transmissions were fitted to most SMs. A 3-speed Borg Warner fully automatic transmission was an option in North America in 1972–73, and in Europe 1974–75.

The engine was also used in the Maserati Merak from 1972 to 1982. Later versions of the Merak &quot;SS&quot; had much larger valves and developed . The Ligier JS2 sports car also used this V6 engine. The final SMs were produced in the Ligier factory in Vichy.

Under new ownership, Maserati developed the 1981 Biturbo model, by applying turbocharging to this engine, and sold 40,000 units.

==Motorsport==

The SM won its first competitive outing, the gruelling 1971 Rallye du Maroc. Citroën continued rallying the SM, eventually developing a &quot;breadvan&quot; short-wheelbase racing variant.

SM World, a marque specialist in Los Angeles, California, produced a turbocharged SM, which in 1987 set the land speed record for production vehicles in its class at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah – traveling .

==Demise==
After the 1974 bankruptcy of Citroën, Peugeot took ownership of the company and, in May 1975, divested from Maserati. Peugeot quickly decided to stop building the SM, as production had dropped to 294 cars in 1974 and 115 units the final year.

Observers often attribute the demise of the SM to the 1973 oil crisis and economic recession.

While the oil shock certainly affected sales, many far more profligate cars were introduced at the same time the SM ceased production, including the hydropneumatically suspended Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9. Peugeot even introduced a V6 powered car of similar displacement and fuel consumption in 1975, the 604. In the U.S. (the main export market for the SM), the SM was actually an economical vehicle relative to its competitors. However, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) imposed new automotive design regulations in 1974, effectively banning the Citroën from the U.S. market.

As illustrated under production numbers, SM sales declined starting in 1972. This appears to be attributable to maintenance issues. Like an exotic Italian car, the Weber carburetors require frequent adjustment. Many engines experienced failure at 60,000 km – it was unclear to most owners that the interference engine design has timing chains that require manual adjustment, an issue not corrected until long after production ceased. The 90° engine timing was unfamiliar to mechanics in the 1970s. Only Buick (1962–66; 1975–) and Jeep (1966–71) used a V6 with 90° between banks of cylinders. Another issue that has been resolved with retrofit is the unreliable ignition breaker cassettes.

Most vehicles require only generalist maintenance, where any competent mechanic can properly maintain the vehicle. Certain vehicles – like Citroëns and Ferraris – require specialist care due to their unique design. While a sturdy car if maintained rigorously, an SM requires two sets of specialist care – Citroën specialists, which are widespread in Europe, and a rarer Maserati specialist, to keep the engine in tune. Once potential buyers began to realize this, sales dropped precipitously.

The Quai André-Citroën factory on the banks of the Seine River in Paris closed in 1974, necessitating new manufacturing facilities for both the DS and the SM. The runout DS models were built at the new Aulnay-sous-Bois factory, while the final 135 examples of the SM were built by Ligier.

Components of the SM lived on, albeit mirror imaged – in the Maserati Merak (engine, transmission) and the Lotus Esprit (transmission). The successful Citroën CX carried forward most of the SM&#x27;s dynamic qualities, including the trendsetting speed sensitive power steering.

==Production numbers==

A total of 12,920 SMs were produced during its lifetime. Sales declined steeply each year following the first full year of production. The North American market took 2,400 cars in 1972 and 1973.

==Variants==
The factory produced just a single body style – a LHD two-door fastback fixed head coupé, but the design did inspire a variety of derivatives, none produced in any quantity.

Coachbuilder Henri Chapron from Levallois-Perret produced several very collectible variants of the SM.

French Presidents from Georges Pompidou to Jacques Chirac enjoyed touring Paris in the two 4-door convertible Citroën SM &quot;présidentielle&quot; models, sharing them with such notables as Pope John Paul II and visiting heads of state. The inaugural drive for this version was a month after completion, by Pompidou and Queen Elizabeth II in May 1972. Built by Chapron to a design by Citroën, the chassis was stretched by to an overall length of . These manual transmission cars have special low gearing and additional cooling suitable for parade use, allowing them to travel at a speed of . They also feature a small, rearward-facing dropdown seat for the use of a translator or secretary, and an electrically powered top with hydraulic actuators. The SM présidentielles served for 37 years and were retired with around on their odometers.

Chapron also created five convertibles (SM Mylord) and seven sedans (SM Opéra). Original examples of these rare models are very valuable – the last &quot;MyLord&quot; sale recorded was for €548,320 in February 2014. Some SM owners have made their own copies of the SM convertible in particular. Unlike the DS, the factory never authorized a convertible model, as Citroën felt the roof was integral to the structure of the SM. On the SM, the roof and rear quarter panels were welded on.

In 1971, Heuliez produced two examples of pillarless targa top convertible, the SM Espace. Unlike the factory SM, the rear quarter windows could retract into the bodywork.

Just before the SM&#x27;s demise, Citroën produced several short-wheelbase racing versions with squared-off rear sections and highly tuned engines – known as the &quot;breadvan&quot; model.

In the UK, three official RHD prototypes were constructed by &quot;Middleton Motors&quot;, a Citroën dealer in Hertfordshire, England. At least one of these prototypes still survives.

In Australia, 12 cars were converted to RHD by &quot;Chappel Engineering&quot; in Melbourne, Australia for &quot;Dutton&#x27;s&quot; (the Australian importer of Citroën at the time). Cars are still being modified with RHD controls and dashboards for the Australian market, where RHD is mandatory.

In the U.S., 100 cars were fitted with an electric sliding steel sunroof built by ASC.

Frua also proposed a concept car based on the SM, a front-wheel-drive car that closely resembled the mid-engine Maserati Merak.

In the spring of 1974, Maserati created a special 4.0 L V8 engine based on the latest C114-11 engine variant. This engine, installed in a standard SM, tested over 12,000 kilometers. The engine was then removed and preserved, while the rest of the car was destroyed by Alejandro de Tomaso. The SM Club of France created an exact replica of this car using the actual engine from the original and displayed it at the Rétromobile 2010 show.

Unfortunately, the intended recipient never received this V8. The Maserati Quattroporte II was a Maserati-badged, four-door variant of the SM with an angular body and lengthened floorpan. The six headlights were retained and the later &#x27;SS&#x27; version of the engine fitted. This model was introduced at the time of Citroën&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1974. It entered production in 1976 and only twelve were produced between then and 1978.

==Prominent owners==
Like the Citroën DS, the SM has had many celebrity owners.
General Secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR Leonid Brezhnev, Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman, Adam Clayton of the rock group U2, and Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia each drove SMs, while Ugandan dictator Idi Amin had seven of them. The Shah of Iran drove an SM.

Actors Lorne Greene and Lee Majors, composer John Williams, author Graham Greene, and former Mauritian QC and Politician Sir Gaetan Duval (1930–1996), football player Johan Cruijff, Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Cheech Marin and Thomas Chong, motorcycle racer Mike Hailwood, composer John Barry, and musician Carlos Santana, all owned SMs as well. Yugoslav and Croatian singer Mišo Kovač had his very own golden SM.

As of 2019, Guy Berryman of Coldplay was driving an SM. Television host and comedian Jay Leno&#x27;s SM is seen frequently in the background of his &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot; YouTube videos.

<text>Lancaster Castle is a medieval castle and former prison in Lancaster in the English county of Lancashire. Its early history is unclear, but it may have been founded in the 11th century on the site of a Roman fort overlooking a crossing of the River Lune. In 1164 the Honour of Lancaster, including the castle, came under royal control. In 1322 and 1389 the Scots invaded England, progressing as far as Lancaster and damaging the castle. It was not to see military action again until the English Civil War. The castle was first used as a prison in 1196 although this aspect became more important during the English Civil War. The castle buildings are owned by the British sovereign as Duke of Lancaster; part of the structure is used to host sittings of the Crown Court.

Until 2011 the majority of the buildings were leased to the Ministry of Justice as HM Prison Lancaster, after which the castle was returned to the Duchy&#x27;s management. The castle is now open to the public seven days a week and is undergoing a large-scale refurbishment. There is a large sweeping public piazza, allowing access to the cloistered area, renovated in 2019. A new section of the café has been built, against the old outer curtain wall, which was reduced in height to afford views of the neighbouring Lancaster Priory. This is the first 21st-century addition to the castle. Another renovated building adjoining the café is leased to Lancaster University as a campus in the city with small conference facilities.

==Background==
Between 60 and 73 AD, a Roman fort was built at Lancaster on a hill commanding a crossing over the River Lune. Little is known about Lancaster between the end of the Roman occupation of England in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. The layout of the town was influenced by the Roman fort and the associated civilian settlement; the main road through the town was the route that led east from the fort. After the Norman Conquest in the second half of the 11th century, Lancaster was part of the Earldom of Northumbria; it was claimed by the kings of England and Scotland. In 1092, William II established a permanent border with Scotland further to the north by capturing Carlisle. It is generally thought that Lancaster Castle was founded in the 1090s on the site of the Roman fort in a strategic location. The castle is the oldest standing building in Lancaster and one of the most important. The history of the structure is uncertain. This is partly due to its former use as a prison, which has prevented extensive archaeological investigation.

==History==

===Foundation===
As there are no contemporary documents recording the foundation of the castle, it is uncertain when and by whom it was started, but it is supposed that Roger de Poitou, the Norman lord in control of the Honour of Lancaster, was responsible. If it was Roger who began construction, the structure would have been built of timber, probably incorporating the earthworks of the Roman fort into its defences. The form of the original castle is unknown. There is no trace of a motte, so it may have been a ringwork – a circular defended enclosure.

Roger de Poitou fled England in 1102 after participating in a failed rebellion against the new king, Henry I. As a result, the king confiscated the Honour of Lancaster, which included the castle. The Honour changed hands several times. Henry granted it to Stephen of Blois, his nephew and later king. When the Anarchy erupted in 1139 – a civil war between Stephen and Empress Matilda for the English throne – the area was in turmoil. Stephen secured his northern frontier by allowing David I of Scotland to occupy the Honour in 1141. It is possible that David refortified the castle at this time. Due to a lack of investigation, there is little evidence to suggest additions to Lancaster in the mid-12th century. However, the uncertain construction date of the keep means that the King of Scotland could have been responsible for building it. The war came to an end in 1153. It was agreed that after Stephen died, he would be succeeded by Henry Plantagenet (later King Henry II), Matilda&#x27;s son. Part of the agreement was that the King of Scotland would relinquish the Honour of Lancaster, which would be held by William, Stephen&#x27;s son. After William&#x27;s death in 1164, the Honour of Lancaster again came under royal control when Henry II gained possession of the Honour.

On the death of Henry II, the Honour passed to his son, Richard the Lionheart, who gave it to his brother, Prince John, in the hope of securing his loyalty. One of the functions castles served was as a prison; the first record of the castle being used in this way was in 1196, although the role became much more important after the English Civil War. Since the 12th century, the monarch appointed a sheriff to maintain the peace in Lancashire, a role usually filled by the duke and based at the castle. In the late 12th and early 13th century, many timber castles founded during the Norman Conquest were rebuilt in stone. Lancaster was one such castle. Building in stone was expensive and time-consuming. For example, the late 12th-century stone keep at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire cost around £200, although something on a much larger scale, such as the vast Château Gaillard cost an estimated £15,000 to £20,000 and took several years to complete. For many castles, the expenditure is unknown. However, work on royal castles was often documented in Pipe Rolls, which began in 1155. The Rolls show that John spent over £630 on digging a ditch outside Lancaster&#x27;s south and west walls, and for the construction of &quot;the King&#x27;s lodgings&quot;. This probably referred to what is now known as Adrian&#x27;s Tower. His successor, Henry III also spent large sums on Lancaster: £200 in 1243 and £250 in 1254 for work on the gatehouse and creating a stone curtain wall.

===14th and 15th centuries===

For the next 150 years, there is no record of building work, although accounts are incomplete. The Well Tower is thought to date from the early 14th century. If there was no work on the castle, this may indicate that it was not important enough to warrant expenditure beyond upkeep, as Lancaster was not near a border. Though the region was generally peaceful, the Scots invaded in 1322 and 1389, reaching Lancaster and damaging the castle. The holdings of the Duchy of Lancaster extended beyond the county, and Lancaster was not especially important. However, when Henry Duke of Lancaster ascended the throne as King Henry IV in 1399, he almost immediately began adding the monumental gatehouse. A further devastation of the town, as had been inflicted in 1389, would have been an embarrassment for the new king; his expensive programme of building at the castle helped protect against this. The gatehouse Henry replaced was probably a simple structure, no more than a passage between two towers, but the rebuilt structure rivalled the keep as the strongest part of the castle. Records show that between 1402 and 1422, the year Henry V died, over £2,500 was spent on building work. While most of this sum would have been spent on the gatehouse, some may have been used to make alterations to the top storey of the keep. Since then, the castle has remained in the ownership of the Crown.
After the Scottish invasion of 1389, Lancaster saw no further military action until the English Civil War. A survey in 1578 led to repairs to the keep costing £235. With the threat of a Spanish invasion, the castle was strengthened in 1585. After Elizabeth I was excommunicated in 1570, she retaliated by declaring Roman Catholic priests guilty of high treason. Any discovered in Lancashire were taken to Lancaster Castle for trial. During the period 1584-1646 fifteen Catholics were executed in Lancaster for their faith. The notorious Pendle witches trial took place at Lancaster Castle in 1612.

===Civil War===
At the outbreak of the Civil War Lancaster was lightly garrisoned. A small Parliamentarian force captured the castle in February 1643, established a garrison and set about building earthworks around the approaches to the town. In response, the Royalists dispatched an army to retake Lancaster. The outer defences fell in March; a siege of the castle lasted just two days as Parliamentarian reinforcements were heading to Lancaster from Preston. The Royalists unsuccessfully tried to recapture Lancaster in April and again in June; the town and castle remained under Parliament&#x27;s control until the end of the war. Orders were given that &quot;all the walls about [Lancaster Castle] should be thrown down&quot;. The instruction was not followed, and in August 1648 the town withstood a siege from the Royalist Duke of Hamilton who led an army south from Scotland. King Charles was executed in January 1649 and shortly after Parliament again ordered the slighting of the castle, apart from buildings necessary for administration and use as a county gaol. The monarchy was restored in 1660, and Charles II visited Lancaster on 12 August and released all the prisoners held in the castle. Lancashire&#x27;s High Sheriff and Justices of the Peace petitioned the king to repair the castle. The buildings were surveyed and repair work estimated at £1,957. After the slighting of the castle, including the demolition of the Well Tower, it was militarily redundant.

===Gaol===

In 1554, the martyr George Marsh was held at the castle before standing trial at Chester Cathedral. Some Quakers, including in 1660 George Fox, were held at the castle for being politically dangerous. County gaols, such as this one, were intended to hold prisoners for short periods immediately before trial. The castle also served as a debtors&#x27; prison. In the 18th century it became more common for county gaols to hold longer-term prisoners; as a result they began to suffer from overcrowding.

Prison reformer John Howard (1726–1790) visited Lancaster in 1776 and noted the conditions in the prison. His efforts to instigate reform led to prisoners in gaols throughout the country being separated by gender and category of their crime. Improvements were also made to sanitation; in the 18th century more people died from gaol fever than by hanging. In the last two decades of the century, around £30,000 was spent rebuilding Lancaster&#x27;s county gaol. Architect Thomas Harrison was commissioned to complete the work. Under his auspices, the Gaoler&#x27;s House was built in 1788 in a Gothic style. Separate prisons were built for men and women. The Shire Hall and Crown Court were complete by 1798. Harrison had to divide his time between Lancaster and designing and building Chester Castle&#x27;s Shire Hall and Courts; work at Lancaster slowed, partly because of dwindling funds due to war with France, and Harrison was released from the work as the Justices of the Peace felt it was taking too long. The artist Robert Freebairn was paid £500 to paint twelve watercolours of the work in 1800 to be presented to the Duke of Lancaster, King George III. In 1802 the castle received more funding and Joseph Gandy was commissioned to complete the interiors of the Shire Hall and Crown Court.

Those sentenced to death before c. 1800 at the castle were usually taken to Lancaster Moor, near where the Ashton Memorial now stands, to be hanged. After the Georgian remodelling of the castle, it was decided it would be more convenient to perform executions nearer the castle. The spot chosen became known as Hanging Corner. Lancaster has a reputation as the court that sentenced more people to death than any other in England. This is partly because until 1835 Lancaster Castle was the only Assize Court in the entire county and covered rapidly growing industrial centres including Manchester and Liverpool. Between 1782 and 1865, around 265 people were hanged at Lancaster; the executions were frequently attended by thousands of people crowded into the churchyard. The Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 ended public executions, requiring that criminals be put to death in private, after which 6 executions were performed inside the castle, at first from the Chapel steps, then later in a purpose-built execution shed, on the inside wall of Hanging Corner. This shed remained until the mid-20th Century, allegedly still containing the Gallows. The last execution (of Thomas Rawcliffe, murderer) at Lancaster took place in 1910. The prison closed in 1916 due to a national decrease in the number of prisoners, although for part of the First World War it held German civilians and military prisoners of war.

Between 1931 and 1937 the castle was used by the county council to train police officers. Lancaster was once again designated for use as a prison from 1954 onwards when the council leased the castle to the Home Office. The last Assizes were held at Lancaster in 1972. As the court and prison were so close, and contained within the castle walls, Lancaster was used for high-security trials.

The castle formally opened as HM Prison Lancaster in 1955, becoming a Category C prison for male inmates, and a venue for the Crown Court. In July 2010 the Ministry of Justice announced it was intending to close it, stating it was outdated and costly. The prison closure was confirmed for March 2011.

==Current status==
The Crown Court continues to sit at the castle. Closure of the prison will eventually allow the castle to be opened to visitors and tourists as a permanent attraction. In the meantime, while access to the keep, towers, battlements and dungeons is currently denied to visitors, the castle operates limited guided tours seven days a week. The Castle Courtyard opened to the public seven days a week in May 2013 and now has a cafe, NICE @ The Castle and regular events now take place every month.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the trials of the Pendle witches, a new long-distance walking route called the Lancashire Witches Walk has been created. Ten &quot;tercet&quot; waymarkers, designed by Stephen Raw, each inscribed with a verse of a poem by Carol Ann Duffy have been installed along the route, with the tenth located here, to mark the end-point.

===Refurbishment===
A large-scale refurbishment of the castle has been underway since 2011. In 2016 Historic England commissioned a tree-ring analysis of oak and pine timbers in the Keep and Gatehouse. The oak timbers in the Keep&#x27;s undercroft were shown to have been felled in AD 1380s, whilst those from the Great Hall were probably felled slightly later, towards the end of the fourteenth century or very early-fifteenth century. The oak timbers in the Gatehouse were probably felled in, or around, AD 1404.

The latest phase, started in September 2017 and completed in November 2019, has opened up the former prison kitchen yard. This phase created a new teaching centre, as well as more than 5,000 sq ft of space, in which the Duchy has leased a section of the old kitchen to local coffee roasters and tea merchants, J. Atkinson &amp; Co. (established 1837) to run a café.

==Layout==
The keep is the oldest part of the castle. It is uncertain when the keep was built, although it probably dates to the 12th century when it was the residence for the lord of the castle—the owner or his representative. In the event of an assault, the keep formed the last line of defence. It is high with four storeys; each floor divided into two rooms. The outer wall is thick; along the exterior are buttresses at each corner and in the middle of each wall. Like most Norman keeps, Lancaster&#x27;s would have been entered at first floor level. Construction in stone would have been a costly and time-consuming exercise, taking around five years and costing about £1,000. The medieval hall stood south-west of the keep and was dismantled in 1796 during the remodelling of the castle. The late-18th- to early-19th-century Shire Hall next to the keep is a large ten-side room.

In the south-west corner of the castle is a cylindrical tower named Adrian&#x27;s Tower from the popular legend that it was built by the Roman Emperor Hadrian. The tower was, however, built in the early 13th century, probably during the reign of King John. Although the exterior was refaced in the 18th century, medieval stonework is visible in the interior.

The main entrance is through a gatehouse built at the start of the 15th century. It was instigated by King Henry IV, although legend attributes the work to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster from 1362 to his death in 1399. Two semi-octagonal towers flank a passageway protected by a portcullis. Battlements project over the gatehouse, and would have allowed defenders to rain missiles on attackers immediately below. Above the gate is a niche which would originally have contained a statue of a saint, flanked by a coat of arms of the kings of England. Because of the legend, a statue of John of Gaunt was placed in the empty niche in the 19th century. Three storeys high, the apartment on the ground floor would probably have been used by the Constable of the castle; the two floors above had three rooms each. After the English Civil War, most of the gatehouse rooms were filled with debtors. The sophistication of the gatehouse prompted John Champness, who wrote &quot;Lancaster Castle: A Brief History&quot;, to remark &quot;it is perhaps the finest of its date and type in England&quot;.

During the Roman era in the 4th century, the fort was surrounded by the &quot;Wery Wall&quot; which is believed to translate as the &#x27;green wall&#x27;. The wall, described as being a &#x27;indestructible mass&#x27; with a defensive ditch, now only remains visible on the east slope of Castle Hill. In his book &quot;The Historic Lands of England&quot;, Sir Bernard Burke suggests the wall may have been visible in more places 100 years prior to his writing in 1849. However, it is unclear where the wall would have been. The remaining Wery Wall measures 4m × 3m × 3m and consists of only rubble due to the facing stones having been reused elsewhere.

==In Art and Literature==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration , to a picture by Thomas Allom showing the Shire Hall and the Priory, was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837.

<text>Edward James Stone FRS FRAS (28 February 18316 May 1897) was an English astronomer.

He was born in Notting Hill, London to Edward and Sarah Stone. Educated at the City of London School, he obtained a studentship at King&#x27;s College London, and in 1856 a scholarship at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he graduated as fifth wrangler in 1859, and was immediately elected fellow of his college.

The following year he succeeded the Rev. Robert Main as chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and at once undertook the fundamental task of improving astronomical constants. The most important of these, the sun&#x27;s mean parallax, was at that time subject to considerable uncertainty. He obtained a value for the solar parallax by observations of Mars in 1860 and 1862. He later refined his estimate by examining observations of the transit of Venus of 1769. He also studied the lunar parallax, and determined the mass of the Moon, and obtained a value for the constant of nutation. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1868.

He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1869, and on the resignation of Sir Thomas Maclear in 1870 he was appointed Her Majesty&#x27;s astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope. His first task on taking up this post was the reduction and publication of a large mass of observations left by his predecessor, from a selected portion of which (those made 1856–1860) he compiled a catalogue of 1,159 stars. His principal work was, however, a catalogue of 12,441 stars to the 7th magnitude between the South Pole and 25°S declination, which was practically finished by the end of 1878 and published in 1881.

Shortly after the death of Main on 9 May 1878, Stone was appointed to succeed him as Radcliffe Observer at Oxford, and he left the Cape on 27 May 1879. At Oxford he extended the Cape observations of stars to the 7th magnitude from 25°S declination to the equator, and collected the results in the Radcliffe catalogue for 1890, which contains the places of 6,424 stars.

Stone observed the transit of Venus of 1874 at the Cape, and organized the government expeditions for the corresponding event in 1882. He was elected President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1882–1884), and he was the first to recognize the importance of the old observations accumulated at the Radcliffe Observatory by Hornsby, Robertson and Rigaud. He successfully observed the total solar eclipse of 8 August 1896 at Novaya Zemlya, and intended a voyage to India for the eclipse of 1898, but died suddenly at the Radcliffe Observatory. The number of his astronomical publications exceeds 150, but his reputation depends mainly on his earlier work at Greenwich and his two great star catalogues—the Cape catalogue for 1880 and the Radcliffe catalogue for 1890.

He had married Grace Tuckett; they had at least four children.

<text>Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), and its successors Concurrent Rambus DRAM (CRDRAM) and Direct Rambus DRAM (DRDRAM), are types of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) developed by Rambus from the 1990s through to the early 2000s. The third-generation of Rambus DRAM, DRDRAM was replaced by XDR DRAM. Rambus DRAM was developed for high-bandwidth applications and was positioned by Rambus as replacement for various types of contemporary memories, such as SDRAM. RDRAM is a serial memory bus.

DRDRAM was initially expected to become the standard in PC memory, especially after Intel agreed to license the Rambus technology for use with its future chipsets. Further, DRDRAM was expected to become a standard for graphics memory. However, RDRAM got embroiled in a standards war with an alternative technology—DDR SDRAM—and quickly lost out on grounds of price and, later, performance. By around 2003, DRDRAM was no longer supported in new personal computers.

== PC main memory ==


The first PC motherboards with support for RDRAM debuted in late 1999, after two major delays. RDRAM was controversial during its widespread use by Intel for having high licensing fees, high cost, being a proprietary standard, and low performance advantages for the increased cost. RDRAM and DDR SDRAM were involved in a standards war. PC-800 RDRAM operated at 400MHz and delivered 1600MB/s of bandwidth over a 16-bit bus. It was packaged as a 184-pin RIMM (Rambus in-line memory module) form factor, similar to a DIMM (dual in-line memory module). Data is transferred on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, a technique known as DDR. To emphasize the advantages of the DDR technique, this type of RAM was marketed at speeds twice the actual clock rate, i.e. the 400 MHz Rambus standard was named PC-800. This was significantly faster than the previous standard, PC-133 SDRAM, which operated at 133 MHz and delivered 1066 MB/s of bandwidth over a 64-bit bus using a 168-pin DIMM form factor.

Moreover, if a mainboard has a dual- or quad-channel memory subsystem, all of the memory channels must be upgraded simultaneously. 16-bit modules provide one channel of memory, while 32-bit modules provide two channels. Therefore, a dual-channel mainboard accepting 16-bit modules must have RIMMs added or removed in pairs. A dual-channel mainboard accepting 32-bit modules can have single RIMMs added or removed as well. Note that the later 32-bit modules had 232 pins as compared to the older 184-pin 16-bit modules.

=== Module specifications ===
==== Continuity modules ====

The design of many common Rambus memory controllers dictated that memory modules be installed in sets of two. Any remaining open memory slots must be filled with continuity RIMMs (CRIMMs). These modules provide no extra memory and only served to propagate the signal to termination resistors on the motherboard instead of providing a dead end, where signals would reflect. CRIMMs appear physically similar to regular RIMMs, except that they lack integrated circuits (and their heat-spreaders).

===Performance===
Compared to other contemporary standards, Rambus showed an increase in latency, heat output, manufacturing complexity, and cost. Because of more complex interface circuitry and increased number of memory banks, RDRAM die size was larger than that of contemporary SDRAM chips, resulting in a 10–20% price premium at 16 Mbit densities (adding about a 5% penalty at 64 Mbit). Note that the most common RDRAM densities are 128 Mbit and 256 Mbit.

PC-800 RDRAM operated with a latency of 45 ns, more than that of other SDRAM varieties of the time. RDRAM memory chips also put out significantly more heat than SDRAM chips, necessitating heatspreaders on all RIMM devices. RDRAM includes additional circuitry (such as packet demultiplexers) on each chip, increasing manufacturing complexity compared to SDRAM. RDRAM was also up to four times more expensive than PC-133 SDRAM due to a combination of higher manufacturing costs and high license fees. PC-2100 DDR SDRAM, introduced in 2000, operated with a clock rate of 133 MHz and delivered 2100 MB/s over a 64-bit bus using a 184-pin DIMM form factor.

With the introduction of the Intel 840 (Pentium III), Intel 850 (Pentium 4), Intel 860 (Pentium 4 Xeon) chipsets, Intel added support for dual-channel PC-800 RDRAM, doubling bandwidth to 3200 MB/s by increasing the bus width to 32 bits. This was followed in 2002 by the Intel 850E chipset, which introduced PC-1066 RDRAM, increasing total dual-channel bandwidth to 4200 MB/s. In 2002, Intel released the E7205 Granite Bay chipset, which introduced dual-channel DDR support (for a total bandwidth of 4200 MB/s) at a slightly lower latency than competing RDRAM. The bandwidth of Granite Bay matched that of the i850E chipset using PC-1066 DRDRAM with considerably lower latency.

To achieve RDRAM&#x27;s 800 MHz clock rate, the memory module runs on a 16-bit bus instead of a 64-bit bus in contemporary SDRAM DIMM. At the time of the Intel 820 launch some RDRAM modules operated at rates less than 800 MHz.

===Benchmarks===
Benchmark tests conducted in 1998 and 1999 showed most everyday applications to run minimally slower with RDRAM. In 1999, benchmarks comparing the Intel 840 and Intel 820 RDRAM chipsets with the Intel 440BX SDRAM chipset led to the conclusion that the performance gain of RDRAM did not justify its cost over SDRAM, except for use in workstations. In 2001, benchmarks pointed out that single-channel DDR266 SDRAM modules could closely match dual-channel 800 MHz RDRAM in everyday applications.

===Marketing history===
In November 1996, Rambus entered into a development and license contract with Intel. Intel announced that it would only support the Rambus memory interface for its microprocessors and had been granted rights to purchase one million shares of Rambus&#x27; stock at $10 per share.

As a transition strategy, Intel planned to support PC-100 SDRAM DIMMs on future Intel 82x chipsets using Memory Translation Hub (MTH). In 2000, Intel recalled the Intel 820 motherboard, which featured the MTH, due to occasional occurrences of hanging and spontaneous reboots caused by simultaneous switching noise. Since then, no production Intel 820 motherboards contain MTH.

In 2000, Intel began to subsidize RDRAM by bundling retail boxes of Pentium 4s with two RIMMs. Intel began to phase out these subsidies in 2001.

In 2003, Intel introduced the 865 and 875 chipsets with dual-channel DDR SDRAM support, which were marketed as high-end replacements of the 850 chipset. Furthermore, the future memory roadmap did not include RDRAM.

== Other uses ==
=== Video game consoles ===

Rambus&#x27;s RDRAM saw use in two video game consoles, beginning in 1996 with the Nintendo 64. The Nintendo console used 4 MB RDRAM running with a 500 MHz clock on a 9-bit bus, providing 500 MB/s bandwidth. RDRAM allowed N64 to be equipped with a large amount of memory bandwidth while maintaining a lower cost due to design simplicity. RDRAM&#x27;s narrow bus allowed circuit board designers to use simpler design techniques to minimize cost. The memory, however, was disliked for its high random-access latencies. In the N64, the RDRAM modules are cooled by a passive heatspreader assembly. Nintendo also included a provision for upgrading the system memory with the Expansion Pak accessory, allowing certain games to be enhanced with either enhanced graphics, higher resolution or increased framerate. A Jumper Pak dummy unit is included with the console due to the aforementioned design quirks of RDRAM.
The Sony PlayStation 2 was equipped with 32 MB of RDRAM and implemented a dual-channel configuration resulting in 3200 MB/s available bandwidth.

=== Texas Instruments DLP ===
RDRAM was used in Texas Instruments&#x27; Digital Light Processing (DLP) systems.

=== Video cards ===

Cirrus Logic implemented RDRAM support in their &quot;Laguna&quot; graphics chip, with two members of the family: the 2D-only 5462 and the 5464, a 2D chip with 3D acceleration. Both have 2 MB of memory and PCI port. Cirrus Logic GD5465 has extended 4 MB Rambus memory, dual-channel memory support and uses faster AGP port. RDRAM offered a potentially faster user experience than competing DRAM technologies with its high bandwidth. The chips were used on the Creative Graphics Blaster MA3xx series, among others.

<doc id="142576" wikidata="Q44652" url="?curid=142576" title="Christian Morgenstern">
<text>Christian Otto Josef Wolfgang Morgenstern (6 May 1871 – 31 March 1914) was a German writer and poet from Munich. Morgenstern married Margareta Gosebruch von Liechtenstern on 7 March 1910. He worked for a while as a journalist in Berlin, but spent much of his life traveling through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, primarily in a vain attempt to recover his health. His travels, though they failed to restore him to health, allowed him to meet many of the foremost literary and philosophical figures of his time in central Europe.

Morgenstern&#x27;s poetry, much of which was inspired by English literary nonsense, is immensely popular, even though he enjoyed very little success during his lifetime. He made fun of scholasticism, e.g. literary criticism in &quot;Drei Hasen&quot;, grammar in &quot;Der Werwolf&quot;, narrow-mindedness in &quot;Der Gaul&quot;, and symbolism in &quot;Der Wasseresel&quot;. In &quot;Scholastikerprobleme&quot; he discussed how many angels could sit on a needle. Still many Germans know some of his poems and quotations by heart, e.g. the following line from &quot;The Impossible Fact&quot; (&quot;Die unmögliche Tatsache&quot;, 1910):

:&quot;Weil, so schließt er messerscharf / Nicht sein kann, was nicht sein darf.&quot;
:&quot;For, he reasons pointedly / That which must not, can not be.&quot;

Embedded in his humorous poetry is a subtle metaphysical streak, as e.g. in &quot;Vice Versa&quot;, (1905):

&quot;Ein Hase sitzt auf einer Wiese,&quot; 
&quot;des Glaubens, niemand sähe diese.&quot; 
&quot;Doch im Besitze eines Zeißes&quot; 
&quot;betrachtet voll gehaltnen Fleißes&quot; 
&quot;vom vis-à-vis gelegnen Berg&quot; 
&quot;ein Mensch den kleinen Löffelzwerg.&quot; 
&quot;Ihn aber blickt hinwiederum&quot; 
&quot;ein Gott von fern an, mild und stumm.&quot;

&quot;A rabbit in his meadow lair 
Imagines none to see him there. 
But aided by a looking lens 
A man with eager diligence 
Inspects the tiny long-eared gnome 
From a convenient near-by dome. 
Yet him surveys, or so we learn 
A god from far off, mild and stern.&quot;
Gerolf Steiner&#x27;s mock-scientific book about the fictitious animal order Rhinogradentia (1961), inspired by Morgenstern&#x27;s nonsense poem &quot;Das Nasobēm&quot;, is testament to his enduring popularity.

Morgenstern was a member of the General Anthroposophical Society. Dr. Rudolf Steiner called him &#x27;a true representative of Anthroposophy&#x27;.

Morgenstern died in 1914 of tuberculosis, which he had contracted from his mother, who died in 1881.

==Gallows Songs==
Morgenstern&#x27;s best known works are the &quot;Galgenlieder&quot; (Gallows Songs, 1905). This volume of humorous verses was followed by &quot;Palmström&quot; in 1910. Published posthumously were the important companion volumes &quot;Palma Kunkel&quot; in 1916, &quot;Der Gingganz&quot; in 1919, and &quot;Alle Galgenlieder&quot; in 1932. In German these works have gone through dozens of different editions and reprints and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

==Morgenstern as translator==
Christian Morgenstern was also an acclaimed translator, rendering into German various prominent works from Norwegian and French, including the dramas and poems of Henrik Ibsen, Knut Hamsun, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and August Strindberg.

==Musical settings==
Morgenstern&#x27;s poems have been set to music by composers such as Erik Bergman (four Galgenlieder, &quot;Das große Lalula&quot;, &quot;Tapetenblume&quot;, &quot;Igel und Agel&quot;, &quot;Unter Zeiten&quot;), Hanns Eisler, Sofia Gubaidulina, Lera Auerbach, Paul Graener, Friedrich Gulda, Paul Hindemith, Robert Kahn, Yrjö Kilpinen, Margarete Schweikert, Matyas Seiber (&quot;Two Madrigals&quot; and &quot;Three Morgenstern Lieder&quot; for soprano and clarinet), Rudi Spring (&quot;Galgenliederbuch nach Gedichten von Christian Morgenstern&quot; op. 19), Siegfried Strohbach (&quot;5 Galgenlieder&quot;), Graham Waterhouse (&quot;Gruselett, Der Werwolf&quot;), Timothy Hoekman (&quot;Der Werwolf&quot; in Drei Legenden) and Alexander von Zemlinsky (&quot;Es waren zwei Kinder&quot;, &quot;Vöglein Schwermut&quot;, &quot;Der Abend&quot;, &quot;Abendkelch voll Sonnenlicht&quot;, &quot;Du gabst mir deine Kette&quot; and &quot;Auf dem Meere meiner Seele&quot;), Andres Condon (&quot;CD Corazon de Aguila&quot;) and Meinrad Kneer (Meinrad Kneer&#x27;s Phosphoros Ensemble plays Christian Morgenstern).

== Essays, reviews and aphorisms==
In his early years Christian Morgenstern wrote a considerable number of essays and reviews for various German periodicals. They have been collected together and published in Volume 6 (Kritische Schriften, 1987) of the German collected works of Morgenstern. His philosophical and mythical works were largely influenced by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the Austrian educationalist Rudolf Steiner (the originator of anthroposophy and the Waldorf school movement), and the Russian writers Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy.

Perhaps Morgenstern&#x27;s most philosophical volume is a collection of aphorisms published posthumously in 1918 entitled &quot;Stufen: Eine Entwickelung in Aphorismen und Tagebuch-Notizen&quot; (Stages: A Development in Aphorisms and Diary Notes). It has given rise to a number of celebrated quotations. These include:
* &quot;Home isn&#x27;t where our house is, but wherever we are understood.&quot;
* &quot;I shall excavate the strata of my soul.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m a man of limits: forever physically, emotionally, morally and artistically on the brink of plunging into the abyss. Yet I manage to keep my balance and possess presence of mind.&quot;
* &quot;I bear no treasures within me. I only possess the power to transform much of what I touch into something of value. I have no depths, save my incessant desire for the depths.&quot; (Translated by David W. Wood)

==Collected works==

<text>The Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System has a library of officially licensed games released during their lifespans, plus 7 official multicarts and 2 championship cartridges. Of these, 672 were released exclusively in Japan, 187 were released exclusively in North America, and 19 were released exclusively in PAL countries. Worldwide, 521 games were released.

Its launch games for the Famicom were &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;, and &quot;Popeye&quot;. Only first-party titles were available upon launch, but Nintendo started a licensing program the following year that allowed third-party companies such as Namco, Hudson Soft, Taito, Konami, Bandai, and Capcom to create titles and produce their own cartridges for the Famicom in exchange for royalty payments; Nintendo later revised the program to mandate itself as the producer of all cartridges while carrying it with the console outside Japan. The launch games for North America were: &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;, &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;Excitebike&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Gyromite&quot;, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, &quot;Ice Climber&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Pinball&quot;, &quot;Soccer&quot;, &quot;Stack-Up&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;, and &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. The final licensed game released is the PAL-exclusive &quot;The Lion King&quot; on May 25, 1995.

As was typical for consoles of its era, the Famicom used ROM cartridges as the primary method of game distribution; each cartridge featured 60 pins, with two pins reserved for external sound chips. For the console&#x27;s North American release in 1985 as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo redesigned the cartridge to accommodate the console&#x27;s front-loading, videocassette recorder-derived socket by nearly doubling its height and increasing its width by , resulting in a measurement of high by wide. Referred to as &quot;Game Paks&quot;, each NES cartridge sported an increased total of 72 pins, with two pins reserved for the CIC lockout chip and ten pins reserved for connections with the console&#x27;s bottom expansion port. However, the two pins for external sound were removed and relocated to the expansion port instead; any Famicom game using them would have its soundtrack recomposed for releases on NES cartridges. Though the extra space of the NES cartridge was not utilized by most games, it enabled the inclusion of additional hardware expansions; in contrast, some copies of early NES games like &quot;Gyromite&quot; merely paired the printed circuit board of the game&#x27;s Famicom version with an adapter to convert between the different pinouts.

Nintendo later released the Famicom Disk System (FDS) in Japan in 1986, intending to have developers distribute all future games on proprietary floppy disks to avoid the cost and size limitations of cartridges; however, developers began re-releasing FDS games on cartridges as advancements in cartridge technology made them feasible again with the limitations of the floppy disks and their ecosystem apparent, pulling support for the FDS by the 1990s.

<doc id="142580" wikidata="Q1360043" url="?curid=142580" title="Misotheism">
<text>Misotheism is the &quot;hatred of God&quot; or &quot;hatred of the gods&quot; (from the Greek adjective () &quot;hating the gods&quot; or &quot;God-hating&quot; – a compound of, , &quot;hatred&quot; and, , &quot;god&quot;).

A related concept is dystheism (, &quot;bad god&quot;), the belief that a god is not wholly good, and is evil. Trickster gods found in polytheistic belief systems often have a dystheistic nature. One example is Eshu, a trickster god from Yoruba religion who deliberately fostered violence between groups of people for his own deeds, saying that &quot;causing ire is my greatest happiness.&quot; Many polytheistic deities since prehistoric times have been assumed to be neither good nor evil (or to have both qualities). Likewise, the concept of the demiurge in some versions of ancient Gnosticism is often portrayed as a generally evil entity. In conceptions of God as the summum bonum (the highest good), the proposition of God not being wholly good would be an oxymoron. Nevertheless, in monotheism, the sentiment may arise in the context of theodicy (the problem of evil, the Euthyphro dilemma) or as a rejection or criticism of particular depictions or attributions of the monotheistic god in certain belief systems (as expressed by Thomas Paine, a deist). A famous literary expression of misotheistic sentiment is Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus&quot;, composed in the 1770s.

A historical proposition close to dystheism is the , &quot;evil demon&quot; () of René Descartes&#x27; &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, which has been interpreted by Protestant critics as the blasphemous proposition that God exhibits malevolent intent. But Richard Kennington states that Descartes never declared his &quot;evil genius&quot; to be omnipotent, but merely no less powerful than he is deceitful, and thus not explicitly an equivalent to God, the singular omnipotent deity.

Thus, Hrafnkell, protagonist of the eponymous &quot;Hrafnkels saga&quot; set in the 10th century, as his temple to Freyr is burnt and he is enslaved, states that &quot;I think it is folly to have faith in gods&quot;, never performing another blót (sacrifice), a position described in the sagas as , &quot;godless&quot;. Jacob Grimm in his &quot;Teutonic Mythology&quot; observes that:

==Terminology==
* &quot;Misotheism&quot; first appears in the Chambers Dictionary in 1907. The Greek () is found in Aeschylus (&quot;Agamemnon&quot; 1090). The English word appears as a nonce-coinage, used by Thomas De Quincey in 1846. It is comparable to the original meaning of Greek  of &quot;rejecting the gods, rejected by the gods, godforsaken&quot;. Strictly speaking, the term connotes an attitude towards the gods (one of hatred) rather than making a statement about their nature. Bernard Schweizer (2002) stated &quot;that the English vocabulary seems to lack a suitable word for outright hatred of God... [even though] history records a number of outspoken misotheists&quot;, believing &quot;misotheism&quot; to be his original coinage. Applying the term to the work of Philip Pullman (&quot;His Dark Materials&quot;), Schweizer clarifies that he does not mean the term to carry the negative connotations of misanthropy: &quot;To me, the word connotes a heroic stance of humanistic affirmation and the courage to defy the powers that rule the universe.&quot;
* &quot;Dystheism&quot; is the belief that God exists but is not wholly good, or that he might even be evil. The opposite concept is &quot;eutheism&quot;, the belief that God exists and is wholly good. &quot;Eutheism&quot; and &quot;dystheism&quot; are straightforward Greek formations from &quot;eu-&quot; and &quot;dys-&quot; + &quot;theism&quot;, paralleling &quot;atheism&quot;; in the sense of &quot;godless, ungodly&quot; appearing e.g. in Aeschylus (&quot;Agamemnon&quot; 1590). The terms are nonce coinages, used by University of Texas at Austin philosophy professor Robert C. Koons in a 1998 lecture. According to Koons, &quot;eutheism is the thesis that God exists and is wholly good, [... while] dystheism is the thesis that God exists but is not wholly good.&quot; However, many proponents of dystheistic ideas (including Elie Wiesel and David Blumenthal) do not offer those ideas in the spirit of &quot;hating&quot; God. Their work notes God&#x27;s apparent evil or at least indifferent disinterest in the welfare of humanity, but does not express hatred towards him because of it. A notable usage of the concept that the gods are either indifferent or actively hostile towards humanity is expressed in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s literary philosophy of Cosmic indifferentism, which pervades the Cthulhu Mythos.
* &quot;Maltheism&quot; is an ad-hoc coining appearing on Usenet in 1985, referring to the belief in God&#x27;s malevolence inspired by the thesis of Tim Maroney that &quot;even if a God as described in the Bible does exist, he is not fit for worship due to his low moral standards.&quot; The same term has also seen use among designers and players of role-playing games to describe a world with a malevolent deity.
* &quot;Antitheism&quot; is direct opposition to theism. As such, it is generally manifested more as an opposition to belief in a god (to theism per se) than as opposition to gods themselves, making it more associated with antireligion, although Buddhism is generally considered to be a religion despite its status with respect to theism being more nebulous. Antitheism by this definition does not necessarily imply belief in any sort of god at all, it simply stands in opposition to the idea of theistic religion. Under this definition, antitheism is a rejection of theism that does not necessarily imply belief in gods on the part of the antitheist. Some might equate any form of antitheism to an overt opposition to God, since these beliefs run contrary to the idea of making devotion to God the highest priority in life, although those ideas would imply that God exists, and that he wishes to be worshiped, or to be believed in.
* Certain forms of &quot;dualism&quot; make the assertion that the thing worshiped as God in this world is actually an evil impostor, but that a true benevolent deity worthy of being called &quot;God&quot; exists beyond this world. Thus, the Gnostics (see Sethian, Ophites) believed that God (the deity worshiped by Jews, Greek Pagan philosophers and Christians) was really an evil creator or demiurge that stood between us and some greater, more truly benevolent real deity. Similarly, Marcionites depicted God as represented in the Old Testament as a wrathful, malicious demiurge.

==Theodicy==

Dystheistic speculation arises from consideration of the problem of evil — the question of why God, who is supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, would allow evil to exist in the world. Koons notes that this is a theological problem only for a eutheist, since a dystheist would not find the existence of evil (or God&#x27;s authorship of it) to be an obstacle to theistic belief. In fact, the dystheistic option would be a consistent non-contradictory response to the problem of evil. Thus Koons concludes that the problem of theodicy (explaining how God can be good despite the apparent contradiction presented in the problem of evil) does not pose a challenge to &quot;all&quot; possible forms of theism (i.e., that the problem of evil does not present a contradiction to someone who would believe that God exists but that he is not necessarily good).

This conclusion implicitly takes the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, asserting the independence of good and evil morality from God (as God is defined in monotheistic belief). Historically, the notion of &quot;good&quot; as an absolute concept has emerged in parallel with the notion of God being the singular entity identified with good. In this sense, dystheism amounts to the abandonment of a central feature of historical monotheism: the de facto association of God with the summum bonum.

Arthur Schopenhauer wrote: &quot;This world could not have been the work of an all-loving being, but that of a devil, who had brought creatures into existence in order to delight in the sight of their sufferings.&quot;

Critics of Calvin&#x27;s doctrines of predestination frequently argued that Calvin&#x27;s doctrines did not successfully avoid describing God as &quot;the author of evil&quot;.

Much of post-Holocaust theology, especially in Judaic theological circles, is devoted to a rethinking of God&#x27;s goodness. Examples include the work of David R. Blumenthal, author of &quot;Facing the Abusing God&quot; (1993) and John K. Roth, whose essay &quot;A Theodicy of Protest&quot; is included in &quot;Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy&quot; (1982):



The (), &quot;deceptive god&quot;, is a concept of Cartesianism. Voetius accused Descartes of blasphemy in 1643. Jacques Triglandius and Jacobus Revius, theologians at Leiden University, made similar accusations in 1647, accusing Descartes of &quot;hold[ing] God to be a deceiver&quot;, a position that they stated to be &quot;contrary to the glory of God&quot;. Descartes was threatened with having his views condemned by a synod, but this was prevented by the intercession of the Prince of Orange (at the request of the French Ambassador Servien). The accusations referenced a passage in the &quot;First Meditation&quot; where Descartes stated that he supposed not an optimal God but rather an evil demon &quot; &amp; &quot; (&quot;most highly powerful and cunning&quot;). The accusers identified Descartes&#x27; concept of a deus deceptor with his concept of an evil demon, stating that only an omnipotent God is &quot;summe potens&quot; and that describing the evil demon as such thus demonstrated the identity. Descartes&#x27; response to the accusations was that in that passage he had been expressly distinguishing between &quot;the supremely good God, the source of truth, on the one hand, and the malicious demon on the other&quot;. He did not directly rebut the charge of implying that the evil demon was omnipotent, but asserted that simply describing something with &quot;some attribute that in reality belongs only to God&quot; does not mean that that something is being held to actually &quot;be&quot; a supreme God.

The evil demon is omnipotent, Christian doctrine notwithstanding, and is seen as a key requirement for Descartes&#x27; argument by Cartesian scholars such as Alguié, Beck, Émile Bréhier, Chevalier, Frankfurt, Étienne Gilson, Anthony Kenny, Laporte, Kemp-Smith, and Wilson. The progression through the &quot;First Meditation&quot;, leading to the introduction of the concept of the evil genius at the end, is to introduce various categories into the set of dubitables, such as mathematics (i.e. Descartes&#x27; addition of 2 and 3 and counting the sides of a square). Although the hypothetical evil genius is never stated to be one and the same as the hypothetical &quot;deus deceptor,&quot; (God the deceiver) the inference by the reader that they are is a natural one, and the requirement that the deceiver is capable of introducing deception even into mathematics is seen by commentators as a necessary part of Descartes&#x27; argument. Scholars contend that in fact Descartes was not introducing a new hypothetical, merely couching the idea of a deceptive God in terms that would not be offensive.

Paul Erdős, the eccentric and extremely prolific Hungarian-born mathematician, referred to the notion of in a humorous context when he called God &quot;the Supreme Fascist&quot;, who deliberately hid things from people, ranging from socks and passports to the most elegant of mathematical proofs. A similar sentiment is expressed by Douglas Adams in &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot; in reference to the temptation of Adam and Eve by God:

[God] puts an apple tree in the middle of [the Garden of Eden] and says, do what you like guys, oh, but don&#x27;t eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting &quot;Gotcha.&quot; It wouldn&#x27;t have made any difference if they hadn&#x27;t eaten it...Because if you&#x27;re dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won&#x27;t give up. They&#x27;ll get you in the end.

==In Jewish and Christian scriptures==
There are various examples of arguable dystheism in the Bible, sometimes cited as arguments for atheism (e.g. Bertrand Russell 1957), most of them from the Pentateuch.
A notable exception is the Book of Job, a classical case study of theodicy, which can be argued to consciously discuss the possibility of dystheism (e.g. Carl Jung, &quot;Answer to Job&quot;).

Thomas Paine wrote in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; that &quot;whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God.&quot; But Paine&#x27;s perspective was a deistic one, critical more of common beliefs about God than of God himself.

The New Testament contains references to an &quot;evil god&quot;, specifically the &quot;prince of this world&quot; (John 14:30, ) or &quot;god of this world&quot; (2 Corinthians 4:4, ) who has &quot;blinded the minds of men&quot;.
Mainstream Christian theology sees these as references to Satan (&quot;the Devil&quot;), but Gnostics, Marcionites, and Manicheans saw these as references to Yahweh (God) himself.

==In art and literature==
Misotheistic and/or dystheistic expression has a long history in the arts and in literature. Bernard Schweizer&#x27;s book &quot;Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism&quot; is devoted to this topic. He traces the history of ideas behind misotheism from the Book of Job, via Epicureanism and the twilight of Roman paganism, to deism, anarchism, Nietzschean philosophy, feminism, and radical humanism. The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, Zora Neale Hurston, Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism while ingeniously veiling their blasphemy.

Other examples include:

* Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus&quot;
* the work of the Marquis de Sade
* Emily Dickinson&#x27;s poem &quot;Apparently With No Surprise&quot; depicts God as approving of suffering in the world, relating the tale of a flower &quot;beheaded&quot; by a late frost as the sun &quot;measure[s] off another day for an approving God&quot;.
* Mark Twain (himself a Deist) argued against what he saw as the petty God many followed in a posthumously published book, &quot;The Bible According to Mark Twain: Writings on Heaven, Eden, and the Flood&quot;. He talks, in part, about the African &quot;sleeping sickness&quot;, malaria.
* Ivan Karamazov in Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s 1879 &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; articulates what might be termed a dystheistic rejection of God. Koons covered this argument in the lecture immediately following the one referenced above. It was also discussed by Peter S. Fosl in his essay titled &quot;The Moral Imperative to Rebel Against God&quot;.
* Konrad, the protagonist of Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Forefathers&#x27; Eve&quot;, is close to calling the God a tsar, an ultimate evil (since when Mickiewicz wrote his work, Poland was under Russian occupation). He wants to do that, because God didn&#x27;t respond to his pleas about giving him the power to rule over people&#x27;s emotion. He loses his strength, and Satan does it for him.

In more recent times, the sentiment is present in a variety of media:

===Poetry and drama===
The characters in several of Tennessee Williams&#x27; plays express dystheistic attitudes, including the Rev. T. Lawrence Shannon in &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;.

Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;Design&quot; questions how God could have created death if he were benevolent.

Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1979) has the character Salieri rebel against a God he feels neglected and humiliated by.

In Jewish author Elie Wiesel&#x27;s play &quot;The Trial of God&quot; (1979), the survivors of a pogrom, in which most of the inhabitants of a 17th-century Jewish village were massacred, put God on trial for his cruelty and indifference to their misery. The play is based on an actual trial Wiesel participated in that was conducted by inmates of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Nazi holocaust, but it also references a number of other incidents in Jewish history including a similar trial conducted by the Hasidic Rabbi Levi Yosef Yitzhak of Berdichev:

In Alan Parker&#x27;s Oscar-winning 1980 feature film &quot;Fame&quot;, one of the main characters (played by Barry Miller) makes an explicit statement against God. Playing an aspiring stand-up comedian who is asked in an acting class to talk about an experience that has affected him deeply in order to sharpen his skills as a performer, he delivers an extended uncut monologue (rare for a mainstream Hollywood film at that time) that heavily criticizes both modern capitalism and religion, concluding with the line &quot;and then we can all go pray to the asshole God who fucked everything up in the first place&quot;.

===Modern literature===
Several non-Jewish authors share Wiesel&#x27;s concerns about God&#x27;s nature, including Salman Rushdie (&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, &quot;Shalimar the Clown&quot;) and Anne Provoost (&quot;In the Shadow of the Ark&quot;):
The writing of Sir Kingsley Amis contains some misotheistic themes; e.g. in &quot;The Green Man&quot; (God&#x27;s appearance as the young man), and in &quot;The Anti-Death League&quot; (the anonymous poem received by the chaplain).

===Speculative fiction===
A number of speculative fiction works present a dystheistic perspective, at least as far back as the works of H. P. Lovecraft and Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s influential philosophical short novel &quot;Star Maker&quot;.

By the 1970s, Harlan Ellison even described dystheism as a bit of a science fiction cliché. Ellison himself has dealt with the theme in his &quot;The Deathbird&quot;, the title story of &quot;Deathbird Stories&quot;, a collection based on the theme of (for the most part) malevolent modern-day gods. Lester del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Evensong&quot; (the first story in Harlan Ellison&#x27;s much-acclaimed &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; anthology), tells the story of a fugitive God hunted down across the universe by a vengeful humanity which seeks to &quot;put him in his place&quot;. &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot; by Philip K. Dick, also from the same anthology, features a horrifying vision of a being, possibly God, who is all-devouring and amoral. Philip Pullman&#x27;s previously mentioned trilogy, &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, presented the theme of a negligent or evil God to a wider audience, as depicted in the 2007 film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; based on the first book of this trilogy.

The original series of &quot;Star Trek&quot; featured episodes with dystheistic themes, amongst them &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;, &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;, &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot;. In &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, Captain Jean-Luc Picard informs Q, a trickster with god-like powers similar to the antagonist in the aforementioned &quot;Squire of Gothos&quot; episode, that 24th-century humans no longer had any need to depend upon or worship god figures. This is an amplification of the tempered anti-theistic sentiment from &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;, in which Captain James T. Kirk tells Apollo that &quot;Mankind has no need for gods, we find the one quite adequate.&quot; A later episode, &quot;Who Watches the Watchers&quot;, depicts accidentally reviving theistic belief in a more primitive species as a negative thing which must be stopped. In &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; it is revealed that the Klingon creation myth involves the first Klingons killing the gods that created them because, &quot;They were more trouble than they were worth.&quot;

In the film &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, anti-hero protagonist Richard B. Riddick stated his own belief, after an imam accuses him of atheism: &quot;Think someone could spend half their life in a slam with a horse bit in their mouth and not believe? Think he could start out in some liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and not believe? Got it all wrong, holy man. I absolutely believe in God... and I absolutely hate the fucker.&quot;

Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, which is mostly about religious institutions, ends with an appearance by Yahweh which is far from complimentary.

The Athar, a fictional organization from the D&amp;D&#x27;s Planescape Campaign Setting denies the divinity of the setting&#x27;s deities. They do, however, tend to worship &quot;The Great Unknown&quot; in their place. In the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; universe, the nation of Rahadoum bans the worship of the setting&#x27;s deities. They do not deny the deities&#x27; power or divinity, but instead believe that worshiping a deity is akin to enslaving ones&#x27; self and that mortals&#x27; problems are best solved without the interference of higher powers.

In the 2013 film &quot;Prisoners&quot;, Holly Jones and her husband Isaac lost their faith in God after their son died of cancer. Since then, they have been kidnapping and murdering children in order to make other parents lose faith in God and turning them into revenge-driven hollow shells of their former selves, i.e. spreading their misotheism to other people. As Holly Jones states to Keller Dover near the end of the film: &quot;Making children disappear is the war we wage with God. Makes people lose their faith, turns them into demons like you.&quot;

In the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, Lex Luthor has a misotheistic view of God, believing that if God was omnipotent, then he logically could not be omnibenevolent and vice versa (the theological problem of evil), thereby solidifying his belief that power cannot be innocent. He has a penchant for constantly implementing allusions to major figures of both pagan and biblical theology, with him notably comparing himself to Prometheus, General Zod to Icarus, and Superman to Zeus, Horus, Apollo, Jehovah and Satan. He even compares himself to the biblical God in one way, claiming to hate &quot;the sin, not the sinner&quot;, and plays God by creating the monster Doomsday.

In the season 1 of &quot;Luke Cage&quot;, Willis Stryker&#x27;s misotheism seemed to enforce his revenge mission against his half-brother Luke Cage, quoting several Bible verses that directly link to Lukes&#x27;s supposed betrayal against Stryker. The Judas Bullet was designed to symbolize this act of treachery; stating &quot;one Judas to another&quot; before shooting Luke in the abdomen and vowing to repeat the same words that Cain said to his father after killing Abel when he finally did kill Cage.

===Popular music===
&quot;Misotheism&quot; is a 2008 album by Belgian black metal band &quot;Gorath&quot;.

Dystheistic sentiment has also made its way into popular music, evincing itself in controversial songs like &quot;Dear God&quot; by the band XTC (later covered by Sarah McLachlan) and &quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot; by Depeche Mode, which tells the story of a teenage girl who attempted suicide, survived, and turned her life over to God, only to be hit by a car, wind up on life support, and eventually die. A good deal of Gary Numan&#x27;s work, specifically the album &quot;Exile&quot;, is laden with misotheistic themes.

The output of Oscar-winning songwriter/composer Randy Newman also includes several songs expressing dystheistic sentiment, including the ironic &quot;He Gives Us All His Love&quot; and the more overtly maltheistic &quot;God&#x27;s Song (That&#x27;s Why I Love Mankind)&quot;, both from his acclaimed 1972 album &quot;Sail Away&quot;. In the latter song, Newman bemoans the futility of dealing with God whose attitude towards humanity he sees as one of contempt and cruelty.

The song &quot;God Made&quot; by Andrew Jackson Jihad proposes dystheism and has an implied hatred for God. More specifically, their song &quot;Be Afraid of Jesus&quot; is about a vengeful Christ although this could be a critique of fundamentalist hate speech.

&quot;God Am&quot; by Alice in Chains from their self-titled album has many misotheistic themes about the perceived apathy of God towards the evil in this world.

&quot;Godwhacker&quot; by Steely Dan from their &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; album developed from a lyric frontman Donald Fagen wrote a few days after his mother died of Alzheimer&#x27;s. &quot;It&#x27;s about an elite squad of assassins whose sole assignment is to find a way into heaven and take out God&quot;, he later explained. &quot;If the Deity actually existed, what sane person wouldn&#x27;t consider this to be justifiable homicide?&quot;

In the song &quot;Terrible Lie&quot; by Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor expresses anger, confusion, and sadness towards God and the world he created.

&quot;Judith&quot; by A Perfect Circle is a satirical song that places blame on God for the illness of the lead singer&#x27;s mother, Judith. Despite her deteriorating condition, Judith never questions why she has been placed in her predicament but instead continues to praise and worship God. Her son angrily mocks god and presents arguments as to why she shouldn&#x27;t have to suffer.

Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Fight Song,&quot; &quot;Say 10,&quot; and others have direct and indirect misotheistic themes.

American death metal bands Deicide and Morbid Angel base much of their lyrics around misotheism in name and in concept. Many bands in the black metal genre, such as Mayhem, Emperor, Gorgoroth and Darkthrone express extreme misotheism in their lyrics.

===Modern art===
In 2006, Australian artist Archie Moore created a paper sculpture called &quot;Maltheism&quot;, which was considered for a Telstra Art Award in 2006. The piece was intended as a representation of a church made from pages of the Book of Deuteronomy:

<text>FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for &quot;Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer&quot;. &quot;Fido&quot; refers to FidoNet, &quot;Opus&quot; refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and &quot;SEAdog&quot; refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee.

==Serial device drivers==
A &quot;FOSSIL driver&quot; is simply a communications device driver. They exist because in the early days of Fidonet, computer hardware was very diverse and there were no standards on how software was to communicate with the serial interface hardware. Initial development of FidoBBS only worked on a specific type of machine. Before FidoBBS could start spreading, it was seen that a uniform method of communicating with serial interface hardware was needed if the software was going to be used on other machines. This need was also apparent for other communications based software. The FOSSIL specification was born in 1986 so as to provide this uniform method. Software using the FOSSIL standard could communicate using the same interrupt functions no matter what hardware it was running on. This enabled the developers to concentrate on the application and not the interface to the hardware.

FOSSIL drivers are specific to the hardware they operate on because each is written to fit specifically to the serial interface hardware of that platform. FOSSIL drivers became more well known with the spread of IBM PC compatible machines. These machines ran some form of DOS (Disk Operating System) and their BIOS provided very poor support for serial communications—so poor that it fell far short of the needs of any non-trivial communications task. Over time, MS-DOS and PC DOS became the prevalent operating systems and PC compatible hardware became predominant.

Two popular DOS based FOSSIL drivers were X00 and BNU. A popular Windows based FOSSIL driver is NetFoss, which is freeware. SIO is a popular OS/2-based FOSSIL driver.

== FOSSIL drivers for hardware other than serial interfaces ==
FOSSIL drivers have also been implemented to support other communications hardware by making it &quot;look like a modem&quot; to the application. 
Internal ISDN cards (that did not use serial ports at all) often came with FOSSIL drivers to make them work with software that was originally intended for modem operation only.

<text>Chorley is a town and the administrative centre of the wider Borough of Chorley in Lancashire, England, north of Wigan, south west of Blackburn, north west of Bolton, south of Preston and north west of Manchester. The town&#x27;s wealth came principally from the cotton industry.

In the 1970s, the skyline was dominated by factory chimneys, but most have now been demolished: remnants of the industrial past include Morrisons chimney and other mill buildings, and the streets of terraced houses for mill workers. Chorley is the home of the Chorley cake.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The name &quot;Chorley&quot; comes from two Anglo-Saxon words, and , probably meaning &quot;the peasants&#x27; clearing&quot;. (also or ) is a common element of place-name, meaning a clearing in a woodland; refers to a person of status similar to a freeman or a yeoman.

===Prehistory===
There was no known occupation in Chorley until the Middle Ages, though archaeological evidence has shown that the area around the town has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age. There are various remains of prehistoric occupation on the nearby Anglezarke Moor, including the Round Loaf tumulus which is believed to date from 3500 BC.

A pottery burial urn from this period was discovered in 1963 on land next to Astley Hall Farm and later excavation in the 1970s revealed another burial urn and four cremation pits dating from the Bronze Age.

===Roman period===
During the Roman era a Roman road ran near Chorley between Wigan and Walton-le-Dale. Hoards dating from the Roman period have also been found nearby at Whittle-le-Woods and Heapey.

===Medieval period===
Chorley was not listed in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, though it is thought to be one of the twelve s in the Leyland Hundred.

Chorley first appears in historical records in the mid thirteenth century as part of the portion of the Croston Lordship acquired by William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, around 1250. The Earl established Chorley as a small borough comprising a two-row settlement arranged along what later became Market Street. It appears that the borough was short lived, as it does not appear in a report of a commission on the Leyland Hundred in 1341. It is most likely that the borough was sacked by the Scots during the Great Raid of 1322, with Chorley being one of the southernmost points reached in Northern England. This led to the construction of a Peel tower, which said to have been located somewhere close to Duxbury Hall.

The manorial history of Chorley is complex as the manor had no single lord throughout most of this period, as it had been split into moieties and was managed by several different families. This led to Chorley having several manorial halls, which in this period included Chorley Hall, built in the 14th century by the de Chorley family, which has since the 19th or 20th century been demolished. Very little is known of Chorley Hall, although according to what the painter John Bird painted in 1795, its location to where it once stood is said to have been where The Parish of St Laurence Church of England Primary School now stands, with phantom steps near to the school within Astley Park being the only physical clue to the hall&#x27;s existence. There is also Lower Chorley Hall, which was owned by the Gillibrand family from 1583 (later rebuilt in the 19th century as Gillibrand Hall). It is believed the borough of Chorley was not a success in this period because of the lack of manorial leadership and the dispersed nature of the small population.

St Laurence&#x27;s Church is the oldest remaining building in Chorley and first appears in historical records when it was dedicated in 1362, though it is believed there was already an earlier Anglo-Saxon chapel on the site which was a daughter foundation of Croston Parish Church. It is believed that the church is named after Saint Laurence, an Irish saint who died in Normandy in the 12th century, whose bones were conveyed to the church by local noble Sir Rowland Standish Duxbury, an ancestor of Myles Standish (an English military officer hired by the Pilgrims as military adviser for their Plymouth expedition to the New World).

As happened in many other instances following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, these relics went missing in the turmoil of the English Reformation under the rule of Henry VIII.

Chorley was granted a market charter by Henry VII in 1498 and have since held it every Tuesday. Before the reformation, it would coincide with a fair that was held annually on the feast of St Lawrence.

===19th century to present===

Chorley, like most Lancashire towns, gained its wealth from the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century which was also responsible for the town&#x27;s growth. Chorley was a vital cotton town with many mills littering the skyline up to the late twentieth century. Most mills were demolished between the 1950s and 2000s with those remaining converted for modern business purposes. Today only a minority remain in use for actual manufacturing, and the last mill to stop producing textiles was Lawrence&#x27;s in 2009.

Also, given its location on the edge of Lancashire Coalfield, Chorley was vital in coal mining. Several pits existed in Duxbury Woods, the Gillibrand area and more numerously in Coppull. Chisnall Hall Colliery at Coppull was considered the biggest Lancashire pit outside of Wigan and one of many located in the Chorley suburb. The last pit in the area to close was the Ellerbeck Colliery in 1987 which was located south of Chorley, between Coppull and Adlington.

The town played an important role during the Second World War, when it was home to the Royal Ordnance Factory, a large munitions manufacturer in the village of Euxton about from the town centre. A smaller factory was also built near the railway line of Blackburn–Wigan in Heapey. 

==Religion==
The Church of England parish church of St Laurence, located on Union Street, has been a place of Christian worship for over 800 years. The Church of England parish church of St George, situated on St George&#x27;s Street, is an important example of the work of architect Thomas Rickman, a major figure in the Gothic Revival. It was built as a Commissioners&#x27; church in 1822.

St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is based in the town centre at Mount Pleasant. The parish was founded in 1847, in a chapel in Chapel Street. The land for the church was purchased in 1851 and the first building erected in 1853. It was opened in June 1853. The church can sit 750 persons. Pugin &amp; Pugin of London and Hansom are the architects.

Chorley United Reformed Church is one of the oldest and largest United Reformed Churches in the north west. Founded in 1792 as an Independent Church it later affiliated to the Congregational church and in 1972 voted to become part of the new United Reformed Church (URC). The church is home to the oldest Scout Troop in the town, established in 1919. In January 2017 it was announced that the church building, which had been at its current site since 1792, would be demolished, and the congregation relocated to other premises. These plans never came to fruition and the church building was instead refurbished in 2020.

The church has a Junior Church together with Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Rainbows, Brownies and Guides. During 2012, the church became the first church to advertise from the air when a very large cross was painted on the church car park. 
In the north of the town, there is a park containing a meeting house and a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The temple, which is regarded as a local landmark, is the largest LDS temple in Europe and named the Preston England Temple. Construction on the temple commenced in 1994 and was completed in 1998. Connected to the temple campus is the England Missionary Training Centre for the LDS Church which houses church representatives preparing to fill proselytizing and service assignments in Great Britain and other parts of Europe.

Chorley&#x27;s only mosque is to be found on the corner of Brooke Street and Charnock Street. The building officially opened in March 2006, having been in planning for over three years. A second mosque opened in 2020.

==Governance==

In 1837, Chorley joined with other townships (or civil parishes) in the area to become head of the Chorley Poor Law Union, which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in the area. Chorley became incorporated as a municipal borough in 1881; it was governed by a mayor, a council of eight aldermen and twenty four councillors.

The population of the Municipal Borough of Chorley remained roughly static in the 20th century, with the 1911 census showing 30,315 people and the 1971 census showing 31,665. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Chorley became the core of a larger non-metropolitan district on 1 April 1974. The present Borough of Chorley has forty-two councillors, representing 14 three-member electoral wards in Chorley town council.

The Member of Parliament for the constituency of Chorley, since 1997, is Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons. He was formerly a Labour MP.

==Geography==

The principal river in the town is the Yarrow. The Black Brook is a tributary of the Yarrow. The name of the River Chor was back-formed from &quot;Chorley&quot; and runs not far from the centre of the town, notably through Astley Park. Chorley is located at the foot of the West Pennine Moors and is overlooked by Healey Nab, a small hill which is part of the West Pennine Moors. It is the seat for the Borough of Chorley, which is made up of Chorley and its surrounding villages.

Chorley had a population of 33,424 at the 2001 census, with the wider borough of Chorley having a population of 101,991. Chorley forms a conurbation with Preston and Leyland and was once proposed as being designated part of the Central Lancashire New Town under the New Towns Act, a proposal which was eventually scaled back.

==Economy==


The first signs of industry, as with many towns in Lancashire, was mining; evidence of which can be seen by the various abandoned quarries on the outskirts of the town. One of these is Anglezarke Quarry, between Chorley and Horwich. Remnants of mining include an old railway bridge from the Duxbury Mine off Wigan Lane. Eventually, the mining industry was replaced by cotton mills.

Manufacture of trucks was inherited from the neighbouring town of Leyland. A large factory on Pilling Lane produced, including military vehicles and tanks during the Second World War.

After the Second World War, production was reduced and the final part of the site was closed in 2008 by BAE Systems. A large part of the site has been redeveloped for residential and industrial use as Buckshaw Village.
Through the twentieth century, especially the latter half, Chorley suffered the loss of much of its manufacturing capacity with great losses in or the completely disappearance of its coal, textiles, motor vehicles and armaments industries.

Leyland Trucks and BAE Systems are Central Lancashire&#x27;s largest employers, with their sites in Leyland and Samlesbury respectively.

Other companies with a presence in the borough are:
* Telent
* FedEx&#x27;s North West depot is located in the town
* DXC Technology has two locations: one in Euxton and the other in Clayton-le-Woods, north of Chorley
* Multipart Solutions Limited, successor to the parts arm of the Leyland DAF
* Porter Lancastrian is a manufacturer of beer pumps, under the &quot;Porta&quot; brand

In 2011, Chorley Council launched an initiative, &quot;Choose Chorley&quot;, to encourage SMEs and large businesses to relocate to Chorley. The initiative offers red carpet introductions to key people in the town, financial incentives and tailored support for business growth.

The town is the home of the Chorley cake. Every October, the &quot;Chorley Cake Street Fair&quot; promotes the cakes, with a competition for local bakers to produce the largest ever Chorley cake; the event restarted in 1995.

==Healthcare==

Chorley is served by the local NHS hospital Chorley and South Ribble Hospital which is located on Euxton Lane, in addition to a private hospital located in Euxton. The town also had another major hospital formerly on Eaves Lane, before this closed in the 1990s. There was also the Heath Charnock isolation hospital on Hut Lane which dealt with infectious diseases before reverting to use for long term patients, before closing in the 1990s.

TransPennine Express services, which operate from Manchester Airport to Glasgow or Edinburgh, pass through the station but do not stop.

The station was also served by the Wigan-Blackburn line, until it was closed in 1960; the line also had stops at Heapey, Brinscall, Withnell and White Bear (Adlington).

Elsewhere in the borough, there are railway stations at Euxton, on the Preston - Wigan line; at Adlington and Buckshaw Village, on the Manchester–Preston line; and at Croston, on the Ormskirk Branch Line.

Some independent schools are also present just outside the borough. Most Chorley children go on to attend the nearby Runshaw College in Leyland. Runshaw College had also expanded into the former administration site of ROF Chorley and was using, amongst others, the main administration building. It is no longer using the site.

Lancashire College, based in Chorley, is a part of Lancashire County Council&#x27;s Lancashire Adult Learning, offering a wide range of courses, a speciality being intensive residential language courses. From 1905 to 1981, the town was home to Chorley Training College (from the 1960s known as Chorley &#x27;Day&#x27; Training College), designed by the Victorian and Edwardian architect Henry Cheers, and the town centre building now occupying this site is now Chorley Public Library.

==Sport==
Chorley is home to the semi professional football team, Chorley F.C., known as the Magpies due to their black and white strip. Founded as a rugby team in 1875, they switched to playing football eight years later. Since then they have had limited success, with their most memorable moments being two appearances in the second round of the FA Cup and two seasons in the Football Conference in the late 1980s. They played in the National League in the 2019/20 season having won promotion from the National League North in the previous season, but were relegated back to the National League North. The team gained fame after qualifying for the 4th round of the 2020-21 season of the FA Cup.

Chorley RUFC was founded in the early 1970s and initially their matches were on played on fields at Astley Park. Since there was no club house in the early days the team played from the Prince of Wales pub, near the town&#x27;s covered market. Work started on a new clubhouse on 22 March 1984 , on an area of land off Chancery Road, situated on the edge of the freshly constructed Astley Village Estate. The club currently run two senior sides and a mini section, the 1st XV playing in the RFU North Lancs 2 division.

Until 2004, Chorley had a rugby league side, Chorley Lynx, who played in League Two of the Rugby League National Leagues. The club was forced to close in 2004, due to small crowds and the withdrawal of funding by backer Trevor Hemmings. Many of the club&#x27;s players and staff joined nearby Blackpool Panthers. The only rugby league side currently active who are situated in Chorley is amateur side Chorley panthers

Chorley is home to track cyclists including Olympic gold medal winners Jason Queally and Bradley Wiggins, and Paralympic silver medallist Rik Waddon, due in part to the proximity of the town to the Manchester Velodrome; it is also the home town of Paralympic gold medallist Natalie Jones.

<text>Astley Hall is a country house in Chorley, Lancashire, England. The building is now owned by the town and is known as Astley Hall Museum and Art Gallery. The extensive landscaped grounds are now Chorley&#x27;s Astley Park.

==History==
The site was acquired in the 15th century by the Charnock family from the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem. The Charnocks built the original timber-framed house, around a small courtyard, about 1575–1600. In 1665, Margaret Charnock married Richard Brooke of Mere in Cheshire (son of Sir Peter Brooke), and they built the present grand but asymmetrical front range of brick with a pair of vast mullion-and-transomed bay windows. This front has a doorway with distinctly rustic Ionic columns, remarkable at such a late date.

The interior is notable for the staggering mid-17th century plasterwork in the ceilings of the Great Hall and drawing room, which have heavy wreaths and disporting cherubs. The ceilings are barbaric in their excesses, and the figures are relatively poorly modelled, although the undercutting is breathtaking. Not all the moulding is of stucco: there are elements of lead and leather too. The staircase is of the same period with a coarse but vigorously carved acanthus scroll balustrade and square newels with vases of flowers on top.

The lower parts of the hall are panelled with inset paintings of a curious selection of modern worthies, including Protestants such as Elizabeth I and William the Silent; Catholics such as Philip II and Ambrogio Spinola; the explorers Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan, and Muslim rulers such as Bajazet and Mohammed II, Sultans of Turkey; it is thought this scheme might be rather earlier than the other work and date from the time of MP Thomas Charnock, who died in 1648. The entire width of the house on the top floor is occupied by a long gallery which contains the finest shovelboard table in existence, long.

The house contains a bird&#x27;s-eye view by an unknown artist showing the house c. 1710, which depicts small tower-gazebos at the angles of its forecourt. In due course, the Brookes failed in the male line and the house descended to Robert Townley Parker of Cuerden, who added the south wing in 1825 and stuccoed the exterior, probably to the design of Lewis Wyatt, who worked for Parker at Cuerden Hall. The dining room in the early 19th-century wing has inlaid 16th-century panelling brought in from elsewhere.

In 1864, the will of alkali manufacturer John Hutchinson of Widnes named one of his executors as &quot;Thomas Part of Astley Hall in Chorley&quot;, although Thomas Part may well not have been the owner at the time.

In 1922 the house and its contents were given to Chorley Corporation by Reginald Tatton, as a memorial to the local men killed in World War I. It has since been maintained as a museum. The house contains fine oak furniture, Flemish tapestries and wooden panelling. It is rumoured that Oliver Cromwell stayed at the Hall during the Battle of Preston in the 17th century, and reportedly left his boots behind. However, recent research shows that these may not be his own boots, although this does not rule out him visiting the Hall. A wide range of temporary exhibitions are displayed in the art gallery throughout the season and events are organised throughout the year.

The plain classical brick stable block with pedimented centre is of c. 1800.

The grounds with a small lake were landscaped by John Webb and feature a picturesque meandering stream running through a wooded ravine.

The Park, Coach House and Walled Garden have recently been renovated with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Chorley Council. An extensive project has seen the restoration of the 17th century ha-ha, de-silting of the lake, felling of trees, moving the pets&#x27; corner and extensive renovation of the coach house and walled garden. The Coach House now houses a new art gallery and conference room on the first floor, with a café and gift shop on the ground floor.

In 2021, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle chose the Hall for the G7 Speakers&#x27; Meeting.

==Present==
The Hall is owned and managed by Chorley Council. It is used as a museum but can also be rented for functions and is open to the public at weekends. There is a £2.50 charge for adult residents of Chorley, and a £1.50 charge for local children, with prices higher for visitors out of the town.

In September 2021 the hall was the venue for G7 Conference. Attendees includes: Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives; Richard Ferrand, the President of the French National Assembly; Roberto Fico, President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies; David Sassoli, President of the EU Parliament, and representatives from Germany, Canada and Japan. The theme of the Speakers&#x27; G7 was &quot;Secure versus Open Parliaments?&quot; 

=== Restoration ===
In 2020 work began to restore Astley Hall to the building&#x27;s original state by removing the render that used to cover the building. The estimated cost of the restoration was £1.1 million, which covered the cost of both removing the render facade and restoring the interior of the building. The building reopened on the 21st May 2022 after restoration works were completed.

<doc id="142586" wikidata="Q11395" url="?curid=142586" title="Domestication">
<text>Domestication is a multi-generational mutualistic relationship in which an animal species, such as humans or leafcutter ants, takes over control and care of another species, such as sheep or fungi, to obtain from them a steady supply of resources, such as meat, milk, or labor. The process is gradual and geographically diffuse, based on trial and error. Domestication affected genes for behavior in animals, making them less aggressive. In plants, domestication affected genes for morphology, such as increasing seed size and stopping the shattering of cereal seedheads. Such changes both make domesticated organisms easier to handle and reduce their ability to survive in the wild.

The first animal to be domesticated by humans was the dog, as a commensal, at least 15,000 years ago. Other animals, including goats, sheep, and cows, were domesticated around 11,000 years ago. Among birds, the chicken was first domesticated in East Asia, seemingly for cockfighting, some 7,000 years ago. The horse came under domestication around 5,500 years ago in central Asia as a working animal. Among invertebrates, the silkworm and the western honey bee were domesticated over 5,000 years ago for silk and honey, respectively.

The domestication of plants began around 13,000–11,000 years ago with cereals such as wheat and barley in the Middle East, alongside crops such as lentil, pea, chickpea, and flax. Beginning around 10,000 years ago, Indigenous peoples in the Americas began to cultivate peanuts, squash, maize, potatoes, cotton, and cassava. Rice was first domesticated in China some 9,000 years ago. In Africa, crops such as sorghum were domesticated. Agriculture developed in some 13 centres around the world, domesticating different crops and animals.

Three groups of insects, namely ambrosia beetles, leafcutter ants, and fungus-growing termites have independently domesticated species of fungi, on which they feed. In the case of the termites, the relationship is a fully obligate symbiosis on both sides.

== Definitions ==

Domestication (not to be confused with the taming of an individual animal), is from the Latin &quot;&quot;, &#x27;belonging to the house&#x27;. The term remained loosely defined until the 21st century, when the American archaeologist Melinda A. Zeder defined it as a long-term relationship in which humans take over control and care of another organism to gain a predictable supply of a resource, resulting in mutual benefits. She noted further that it is not synonymous with agriculture since agriculture depends on domesticated organisms but does not automatically result from domestication.

Purugganan notes that domestication has been hard to define, despite the &quot;instinctual consensus&quot; that it means &quot;the plants and animals found under the care of humans that provide us with benefits and which have evolved under our control.&quot; He comments that insects such as termites, ambrosia beetles, and leafcutter ants have domesticated some species of fungi, and notes further that other groups such as weeds and commensals have wrongly been called domesticated. Starting from Zeder&#x27;s definition, Purugganan proposes a &quot;broad&quot; definition: &quot;a coevolutionary process that arises from a mutualism, in which one species (the domesticator) constructs an environment where it actively manages both the survival and reproduction of another species (the domesticate) in order to provide the former with resources and/or services.&quot; He comments that this adds niche construction to the activities of the domesticator.

Domestication syndrome is the suite of phenotypic traits that arose during the initial domestication process and which distinguish crops from their wild ancestors. It can also mean a set of differences now observed in domesticated mammals, not necessarily reflecting the initial domestication process. The changes include increased docility and tameness, coat coloration, reductions in tooth size, craniofacial morphology, ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), estrus cycles, levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in brain size and of particular brain regions.

== Cause and timing ==

The domestication of animals and plants was triggered by the climatic and environmental changes that occurred after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum and which continue to this present day. These changes made obtaining food by hunting and gathering difficult. The first animal to be domesticated was the dog at least 15,000 years ago. The Younger Dryas 12,900 years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging strategies but did not favour agriculture. By the beginning of the Holocene 11,700 years ago, a warmer climate and increasing human populations led to small-scale animal and plant domestication and an increased supply of food.

The appearance of the domestic dog in the archaeological record, at least 15,000 years ago, was followed by domestication of livestock and of crops such as wheat and barley, the invention of agriculture, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet. For instance, small-scale trial cultivation of cereals began some 28,000 years ago at the Ohalo II site in Israel.

In the Fertile Crescent 11,000–10,000 years ago, zooarchaeology indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and taurine cattle were the first livestock to be domesticated. Two thousand years later, humped zebu cattle were domesticated in what is today Baluchistan in Pakistan. In East Asia 8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar genetically different from those found in the Fertile Crescent. The cat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, perhaps 10,000 years ago, from European wildcats, possibly to control rodents that were damaging stored food.

== Animals ==

=== Desirable traits ===

The domestication of vertebrate animals is the relationship between non-human vertebrates and humans who have an influence on their care and reproduction. In his 1868 book &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot;, Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits and unconscious selection, in which traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits.

There is a difference between domestic and wild populations; some of these differences constitute the domestication syndrome, traits presumed essential in the early stages of domestication, while others represent later improvement traits. Domesticated mammals in particular tend to be smaller and less aggressive than their wild counterparts; other common traits are floppy ears, a smaller brain, and a shorter muzzle. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.

Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication because of their behavioral characteristics:

# The size and organization of their social structure
# The availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates
# The ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth
# The degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance
# Responses to humans and new environments, including reduced flight response and reactivity to external stimuli.

=== Mammals ===

The beginnings of mammal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. There are three proposed major pathways that most mammal domesticates followed into domestication:

# commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, possibly pigs)
# prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca)
# animals targeted for draft and riding (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).

Humans did not intend to domesticate mammals from either the commensal or prey pathways, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal would result from it. In both of those cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them intensified, and humans&#x27; role in their survival and reproduction gradually led to formalized animal husbandry. Although the directed pathway for draft and riding animals proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented, and archaeological records suggest that they took place over much longer time frames.

Unlike other domestic species selected primarily for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. The dog was domesticated long before other animals, becoming established across Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era, well before agriculture.

The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – such as in donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. Human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs, and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may apply to other domesticated animals.
The 2023 parasite-mediated domestication hypothesis suggests that endoparasites such as helminths and protozoa could have mediated the domestication of mammals. Domestication involves taming, which has an endocrine component; and parasites can modify endocrine activity and microRNAs. Genes for resistance to parasites might be linked to those for the domestication syndrome; it is predicted that domestic animals are less resistant to parasites than their wild relatives.

=== Birds ===

Domesticated birds principally mean poultry, raised for meat and eggs: some Galliformes (chicken, turkey, guineafowl) and Anseriformes (waterfowl: ducks, geese, and swans). Also widely domesticated are cagebirds such as songbirds and parrots; these are kept both for pleasure and for use in research.
The domestic pigeon has been used both for food and as a means of communication between far-flung places through the exploitation of the pigeon&#x27;s homing instinct; research suggests it was domesticated as early as 10,000 years ago. Chicken fossils in China have been dated to 7,400 years ago. The chicken&#x27;s wild ancestor is &quot;Gallus gallus&quot;, the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia. The species appears to have been kept initially for cockfighting rather than for food.

===Invertebrates ===

Two insects, the silkworm and the western honey bee, have been domesticated for over 5,000 years, often for commercial use. The silkworm is raised for the silk threads wound around its pupal cocoon; the western honey bee, for honey, and, from the 20th century, for pollination of crops.

Several other invertebrates have been domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including some such as &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian &quot;Hydra&quot; for research into genetics and physiology. Few have a long history of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological pest control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine mollusks are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera &quot;Helix&quot; are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects, including the fly &quot;Eucelatoria&quot;, the beetle &quot;Chrysolina&quot;, and the wasp &quot;Aphytis&quot; are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.

== Plants ==

Humans foraged for wild cereals, seeds, and nuts thousands of years before they were domesticated; wild wheat and barley, for example, were gathered in the Levant at least 23,000 years ago. Neolithic societies in West Asia first began to cultivate and then domesticate some of these plants around 13,000 to 11,000 years ago. The founder crops of the West Asian Neolithic included cereals (emmer, einkorn wheat, barley), pulses (lentil, pea, chickpea, bitter vetch), and flax. Other plants were independently domesticated in 13 centers of origin (subdivided into 24 areas) of the Americas, Africa, and Asia (the Middle East, South Asia, the Far East, and New Guinea and Wallacea); in some thirteen of these regions people began to cultivate grasses and grains. Rice was first cultivated in East Asia. Sorghum was widely cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa, while peanuts, squash, cotton, maize, potatoes, and cassava were domesticated in the Americas.

Continued domestication was gradual and geographically diffuse – happening in many small steps and spread over a wide area – on the evidence of both archaeology and genetics. It was a process of intermittent trial and error and often resulted in diverging traits and characteristics.

Whereas domestication of animals impacted most on the genes that controlled behavior, that of plants impacted most on the genes that controlled morphology (seed size, plant architecture, dispersal mechanisms) and physiology (timing of germination or ripening), as in the domestication of wheat. Wild wheat shatters and falls to the ground to reseed itself when ripe, but domesticated wheat stays on the stem for easier harvesting. This change was possible because of a random mutation in the wild populations at the beginning of wheat&#x27;s cultivation. Wheat with this mutation was harvested more frequently and became the seed for the next crop. Therefore, without realizing it, early farmers selected for this mutation. The result is domesticated wheat, which relies on farmers for its reproduction and dissemination.

=== Differences from wild plants ===

Domesticated plants differ from their wild relatives in many ways, including

* lack of shattering such as of cereal ears (ripe heads), loss of fruit abscission
* less efficient breeding system (e.g. without normal pollinating organs, making human intervention a requirement), larger seeds with lower success in the wild, or even sterility (e.g. seedless fruits) and therefore only vegetative reproduction
* better palatability (e.g. higher sugar content, reduced bitterness), better smell, and lower toxicity
* edible part larger, e.g. cereal grains or fruits 
* edible part more easily separated from non-edible part
* increased number of fruits or grains
* altered color, taste, and texture
* daylength independence
* determinate growth
* reduced or no vernalization
* less seed dormancy.

Plant defenses against herbivory, such as thorns, spines, and prickles, poison, protective coverings, and sturdiness may have been reduced in domesticated plants. This would make them more likely to be eaten by herbivores unless protected by humans, but there is only weak support for most of this. Farmers did select for reduced bitterness and lower toxicity and for food quality, which likely increased crop palatability to herbivores as to humans. However, a survey of 29 plant domestications found that crops were as well-defended against two major insect pests (beet armyworm and green peach aphid) both chemically (e.g. with bitter substances) and morphologically (e.g. with toughness) as their wild ancestors.

=== Changes to plant genome ===

During domestication, crop species undergo intense artificial selection that alters their genomes, establishing core traits that define them as domesticated, such as increased grain size. Comparison of the coding DNA of chromosome 8 in rice between fragrant and non-fragrant varieties showed that aromatic and fragrant rice, including basmati and jasmine, is derived from an ancestral rice domesticate that suffered a deletion in exon 7 which altered the coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2). Comparison of the potato genome with that of other plants located genes for resistance to potato blight caused by &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;.

In coconut, genomic analysis of 10 microsatellite loci (of noncoding DNA) found two episodes of domestication based on differences between individuals in the Indian Ocean and those in the Pacific Ocean.
The coconut experienced a founder effect, where a small number of individuals with low diversity founded the modern population, permanently losing much of the genetic variation of the wild population. Population bottlenecks which reduced variation throughout the genome at some later date after domestication are evident in crops such as pearl millet, cotton, common bean and lima bean.

In wheat, domestication involved repeated hybridization and polyploidy. These steps are large and essentially instantaneous changes to the genome and the epigenome, enabling a rapid evolutionary response to artificial selection. Polyploidy increases the number of chromosomes, bringing new combinations of genes and alleles, which in turn enable further changes such as by chromosomal crossover.

=== Impact on plant microbiome ===

The microbiome, the collection of microorganisms inhabiting the surface and internal tissue of plants, is affected by domestication. This includes changes in microbial species composition and diversity. Plant lineage, including speciation, domestication, and breeding, have shaped plant endophytes (phylosymbiosis) in similar patterns as plant genes.

== Fungi ==


Several species of fungi have been domesticated for use directly as food, or in fermentation to produce foods and drugs. The cultivated mushroom &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; is widely grown for food. The yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; have been used for thousands of years to ferment beer and wine, and to leaven bread. Mould fungi including &quot;Penicillium&quot; are used to mature cheeses and other dairy products, as well as to make drugs such as antibiotics.

== Effects ==

=== On domestic animals ===

Selection of animals for visible traits may have undesired consequences for the genetics of domestic animals. A side effect of domestication has been zoonotic diseases. For example, cattle have given humanity various viral poxes, measles, and tuberculosis; pigs and ducks have contributed influenza; and horses have brought the rhinoviruses. Many parasites, too, have their origins in domestic animals. Alongside these, the advent of domestication resulted in denser human populations, which provided ripe conditions for pathogens to reproduce, mutate, spread, and eventually find a new host in humans.

=== On society ===

Scholars have expressed widely differing viewpoints on domestication&#x27;s effects on society. Anarcho-primitivism critiques domestication as destroying the supposed primitive state of harmony with nature in hunter-gatherer societies, and replacing it, possibly violently or by enslavement, with a social hierarchy as property and power emerged. The dialectal naturalist Murray Bookchin has argued that domestication of animals, in turn, meant the domestication of humanity, both parties being unavoidably altered by their relationship with each other. The sociologist David Nibert asserts that the domestication of animals involved violence against animals and damage to the environment. This, in turn, he argues, corrupted human ethics and paved the way for &quot;conquest, extermination, displacement, repression, coerced and enslaved servitude, gender subordination and sexual exploitation, and hunger.&quot;

=== On diversity ===

Domesticated ecosystems provide food, reduce predator and natural dangers, and promote commerce, but their creation has resulted in habitat alteration or loss, and multiple extinctions commencing in the Late Pleistocene.

Domestication reduces genetic diversity of the domesticated population, especially of alleles of genes targeted by selection. One reason is a population bottleneck created by artificially selecting the most desirable individuals to breed from. Most of the domesticated strain is then born from just a few ancestors, creating a situation similar to the founder effect. Domesticated populations such as of dogs, rice, sunflowers, maize, and horses have an increased mutation load, as expected in a population bottleneck where genetic drift is enhanced by the small population size. Mutations can also be fixed in a population by a selective sweep. Mutational load can be increased by reduced selective pressure against moderately harmful traits when reproductive fitness is controlled by human management. However, there is evidence against a bottleneck in crops, such as barley, maize, and sorghum, where genetic diversity slowly declined rather than showing a rapid initial fall at the point of domestication. Further, the genetic diversity of these crops was regularly replenished from the natural population. Similar evidence exists for horses, pigs, cows, and goats.

== Domestication by insects ==

At least three groups of insects, namely ambrosia beetles, leafcutter ants, and fungus-growing termites, have domesticated species of fungi.

=== Ambrosia beetles ===

Ambrosia beetles in the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae excavate tunnels in dead or stressed trees into which they introduce fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant&#x27;s xylem tissue, extracts nutrients from it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery. Ambrosia fungi are typically poor wood degraders and instead utilize less demanding nutrients. Symbiotic fungi produce and detoxify ethanol, which is an attractant for ambrosia beetles and likely prevents the growth of antagonistic pathogens and selects for other beneficial symbionts. Ambrosia beetles mainly colonise wood of recently dead trees.

=== Leafcutter ants ===

The leafcutter ants are any of some 47 species of leaf-chewing ants in the genera &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; and &quot;Atta&quot;. The ants carry the discs of leaves that they have cut back to their nest, where they feed the leaf material to the fungi that they tend. Some of these fungi are not fully domesticated: the fungi farmed by &quot;Mycocepurus smithii&quot; constantly produce spores that are not useful to the ants, which eat fungal hyphae instead. The process of domestication by &quot;Atta&quot; ants, on the other hand, is complete; it took 30 million years.

=== Fungus-growing termites ===

Some 330 fungus-growing termite species of the subfamily Macrotermitinae cultivate &quot;Termitomyces&quot; fungi to eat; domestication occurred exactly once, 25–40 mya. The fungi, described by Roger Heim in 1942, grow on &#x27;combs&#x27; formed from the termites&#x27; excreta, dominated by tough woody fragments. The termites and the fungi are both obligate symbionts in the relationship.

<text>Braindead (also known as Dead Alive in North America) is a 1992 New Zealand zombie comedy splatter film directed by Peter Jackson, produced by Jim Booth, and written by Stephen Sinclair, Fran Walsh, and Jackson based on an original story idea by Sinclair. It stars Timothy Balme, Diana Peñalver, Elizabeth Moody and Ian Watkin. The plot follows Lionel, a young man living in South Wellington with his strict mother Vera. After Lionel becomes romantically entangled with a girl named Paquita, Vera is bitten by a hybrid rat-monkey creature and begins to transform into a zombie, while also infecting swathes of the city&#x27;s populace.

Made on a budget of $3 million, &quot;Braindead&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s most expensive film up to that point. Although it received positive reviews from critics, it was a box office bomb. It has since received a cult following, and is now widely regarded as one of the goriest films of all time.

==Plot==
In 1957, on Skull Island, zoo official Stewart McAlden and his team attempts to smuggle out a Sumatran rat-monkey, a hybrid creature that resulted from the rape of tree monkeys by plague-carrying rats. While fleeing from the island&#x27;s warrior natives, who demand the creature&#x27;s return, Stewart is bitten by the rat-monkey. The crew, fearing the effects of the bite, dismembers and kills him. The captured rat-monkey is then shipped to Wellington Zoo in Newtown.

In Hataitai, the meek Lionel Cosgrove lives with his domineering mother Vera in a Victorian mansion. To Vera&#x27;s dismay, Lionel falls in love with Paquita María Sánchez, a Spanish Romani shopkeeper&#x27;s daughter. When the two go on a date at Wellington Zoo, Vera stalks them and is bitten by the rat-monkey, which she promptly bludgeons with her heel.

Over the following days, Vera grows more decrepit and dies before reanimating as a ravenous zombie. Vera devours Paquita&#x27;s dog and kills the attending nurse, Mrs. McTavish, who also returns as a zombie. Although unable to comprehend what&#x27;s going on, Lionel keeps them sedated with animal tranquilizers and locked in the basement. He frantically covers the mess as Paquita&#x27;s grandmother comes over to visit and gives him a pendant for luck. Vera breaks out of the basement and is run over by a tram.

Lionel arranges Vera&#x27;s funeral and burial, keeping her tranquilized to protect the mourners. Later, he returns to the graveyard to administer more tranquilizer, but is beaten by a group of hoodlums who mistake him for a necrophiliac. Vera bursts from her grave and attacks the hoodlums. In the ensuing commotion, the gang leader &quot;Void&quot;, as well as the local priest Father McGruder, are bitten and become zombies, so Lionel locks them up in the basement as well. After discovering the nurse and priest have copulated and produced a zombie baby, Lionel breaks up with Paquita to keep her safe.

Lionel&#x27;s uncle Les arrives to wrangle with Lionel over Vera&#x27;s estate. In the basement, Les sees the tranquilized zombies and believes them to be dead bodies. Les blackmails his nephew into giving up the house and his inheritance. He invites his friends over for a housewarming party despite Lionel&#x27;s objections.

During the party, Paquita arrives to make amends with Lionel. After she discovers the zombies in the basement, Lionel explains the situation. She convinces Lionel to use poison to kill the zombies. However, Lionel mistakenly injects them with animal stimulant. The pair narrowly escapes as the invigorated zombies rush upstairs and infect the party guests. Lionel uses a lawn mower to mow through the zombies, while Paquita disposes of the (still hostile) zombie body parts with a blender. Les enters the basement, where he is beheaded by Vera, who has now grown to monstrous proportions. Vera erupts from the basement and pursues Lionel and Paquita to the rooftop as the house catches fire from a burst gas pipe.

Lionel confronts Vera and reveals that he witnessed her drowning his father and his mistress as a child, which caused his trauma. After he proclaims to no longer be afraid of her, an enraged Vera stuffs Lionel into her stomach and prepares to kill Paquita. Lionel cuts his way out of his mother&#x27;s body with the good luck pendant, causing Vera to fall into the burning house. 

Lionel and Paquita escape the burning rooftop as the fire brigade arrives. They kiss and then walk away arm-in-arm.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal photography took place over eleven weeks on location in and around Wellington on a reported budget of around $3 million. The film had its origins while Jackson was filming his feature film debut, &quot;Bad Taste&quot; (1987). He met with writers Fran Walsh and Stephen Sinclair, who were also interested in creating a zombie film, and the three spent the next several years conceiving the project. The film was shot on Super 16mm, as opposed to 35mm, so that more of the budget could be spent on effects. The film&#x27;s special effects were crafted by Bob McCarron and Richard Taylor, with some miniature models being created by Jackson himself. For the film&#x27;s climactic scene, wherein Lionel massacres a horde of zombies with a lawn mower, a reputed 300 litres (79.2 gallons) of fake blood was used.

The film&#x27;s music was composed by Peter Dasent.

The film was subject to a lawsuit after release. In &quot;Bradley v WingNut Films Ltd&quot; [1993] 1 NZLR 415, it was alleged that &quot;Braindead&quot; had infringed the privacy of the plaintiffs by containing pictures of the plaintiff&#x27;s family tombstone. After reviewing the New Zealand judicial authorities on privacy, Gallen J stated: &quot;the present situation in New Zealand ... is that there are three strong statements in the High Court in favour of the existence of such a tort in this country and an acceptance by the Court of Appeal that the concept is at least arguable.&quot; This case became one of a series of cases which contributed to the introduction of tort invasions of privacy in New Zealand.

==Filming locations==

The film was mostly shot in and around Wellington&#x27;s southern and western suburbs. Some filming locations include:
* Pūtangirua Pinnacles acts as Skull Island in the film.
* Wellington Zoo, Newtown.
* No. 12 Hinau Road, Hataitai, Wellington is Lionel&#x27;s house in the movie.
* Karori Cemetery, Wellington.
* The store where Lionel and Paquita first meet at 29 Sutherland Rd, Melrose, Wellington, on the corner of Rodrigo Road and Sutherland Road.
* The park used in the scene with Lionel and Selwyn was filmed in the children&#x27;s play area of the Wellington Botanical Gardens.
* A Fieldair Freight DC-3 lands at Wellington International Airport.
* Queens Drive, Lyall Bay, Wellington.
* Lionel goes to the veterinary clinic on located on 20 Standen St, Karori, Wellington.

==Release==
&quot;Braindead&quot; released on 13 August 1992 in New Zealand. It was subsequently released in the United States on 12 February 1993 under the title &quot;Dead Alive&quot; and grossed $23,765 in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $242,623 in the country. The soundtrack was released in 1992 by Mana Music.

The film has had several releases on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD around the world. It was first released on Blu-ray as &quot;Dead Alive&quot; by Lionsgate in October 2011, with the US 97-minute cut.

In December 2018, Peter Jackson announced that he plans to restore &quot;Braindead&quot;, along with his previous films &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; for a possible 4K release.

=== Alternate versions ===
The film was released in a number of different versions. In some nations, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, the 104-minute film was shown in full. In fact, the UK&#x27;s British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) found the film&#x27;s gory content so light-hearted and comical that there was consideration on giving the film a 15 certificate, which would have granted it to be seen by a much younger audience. They ultimately decided to give the film an 18 rating because the amount of gore confounded the expectations of a 15 rating.

In countries where the censors balked at the extreme gore, the film was initially banned or left unrated before being heavily cut. In Germany, a 94-minute version was seen with major cuts to some of the film&#x27;s grislier scenes but was widely ignored. A FSK 16 rated version was released in Germany under the American title &quot;Dead Alive&quot;, omitting almost the entirety of the violence. The uncut version, as well as several cut versions, are banned in Germany. It is also illegal to publicly exhibit the film in Germany. The gory violence has also caused the film to be banned in South Korea, Singapore, and Finland. However, the film was unbanned and released uncut in the latter country in 2001.

In the United States, the film was released as &quot;Dead Alive&quot;, because of another film with rights to the practically identical title &quot;Brain Dead&quot;. There were two versions released in the country; the unrated cut is 97 minutes, and the R-rated version is only 85 minutes with many of the gore scenes removed.

==Critical reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The delightfully gonzo tale of a lovestruck teen and his zombified mother, &quot;Dead Alive&quot; is extremely gory and exceedingly good fun, thanks to Peter Jackson&#x27;s affection for the tastelessly sublime.&quot; Metacritic rated it 54 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

At the time of its release, David Stratton, writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, gave a positive review, calling it &quot;Jackson&#x27;s best film to date&quot; and praising its humour, acting, and technical qualities (gore effects, makeup). He stated &quot;Kiwi gore specialist Peter Jackson, who goes for broke with an orgy of bad taste and splatter humor. Some will recoil from the gore, but &quot;Braindead&quot; wasn&#x27;t made for them.&quot; Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; enjoyed the film, stating that it &quot;is the most hilariously disgusting movie ever made. It makes something like &quot;Re-Animator&quot; seem like a UNESCO documentary about Mother Teresa.&quot; The film received a negative review from &quot;The Independent&quot; writer Quentin Curtis, who complained that &quot;it never decides whether to make you tremble with laughter or fear, and has outstayed its welcome long before the last limb has been severed and entrail spilled.&quot; For &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman wrote that the film was &quot;breezy and good-natured&quot;, giving praise to the gore special effects.

Retrospective reception was also positive. &quot;Braindead&quot; placed at number 91 in a top 100 list produced by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine after conducting a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre. Simon Pegg, actor, comedian, and friend of Jackson, wrote in his autobiography &quot;Nerd Do Well: A Small Boy&#x27;s Journey to Becoming a Big Kid&quot; that &quot;Braindead&quot; is one of the main influences on his 2004 zombie film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;.

<text>Monastic houses in England include abbeys, priories and friaries, among other monastic religious houses.
The sites are listed by modern (post-1974) county.
==Overview==
The list is presented in alphabetical order of ceremonial county. Foundations are listed alphabetically within each county.

Communities/provenance: shows the status and communities existing at each establishment, together with such dates as have been established as well as the fate of the establishment after dissolution, and the current status of the site.

Formal name or dedication is the formal name of the establishment or the person in whose name the church is dedicated, where known.

Some of the establishments have had alternative names over the course of time; such alternatives in name or spelling have been given.

Alien houses are included, as are smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks), and also camerae of the military orders of monks (Knights Templars and Knights Hospitaller). The numerous monastic hospitals &quot;per se&quot; are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or preceptor/commandery.

The name of the county is given where there is reference to an establishment in another county. Where the county has changed since the foundation&#x27;s dissolution the modern county is given in parentheses, and in instances where the referenced foundation ceased to exist before the unification of England, the kingdom is given, followed by the modern county in parentheses.

==Abbreviations and key==

Locations with names in &quot;italics&quot; indicate probable duplication (misidentification with another location) or non-existent foundations (either erroneous reference or proposed foundation never implemented) or ecclesiastical establishments with a monastic appellation but lacking monastic connection.

<text>P and R measures are the statistics used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, particularly automated business processes.

The P measures are the &quot;process&quot; measures – these statistics that record the number of times things occur. Examples include:
* the number of times an error loop is used
* the number of times an approval loop is used
* the average time to complete a particular task in the process
and show how efficient the process is.

The R measures are the &quot;results&quot; measures – these statistics record the &#x27;outcomes&#x27; of the process. Examples include:
* the number of occasions when the process completed correctly
* the number of times rejections occurred
* the number of times approval was not given
and show how effective the process is.

<text>List of monastic houses in Scotland is a catalogue of the abbeys, priories, friaries and other monastic religious houses of Scotland.

In this article alien houses are included, as are smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks). The numerous monastic hospitals &quot;per se&quot; are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have, the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or preceptory/commandery.

The geographical co-ordinates provided are sourced from details provided by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments in Scotland (RCAHMS) and Ordnance Survey publications.

<text>Anthony Stafford Beer (25 September 1926 – 23 August 2002) was a British theorist, consultant and professor at the Manchester Business School. He is best known for his work in the fields of operational research and management cybernetics.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Beer was born in Putney, London in 1926. His father was William John Beer, chief statistician at Lloyd&#x27;s Register of Shipping, who shared a birthday with his mother, Doris Ethel Beer. At age 17 Stafford Beer was expelled from Whitgift School. He enrolled for a degree in philosophy at University College London before leaving to join the army as a Gunner in the Royal Artillery in 1944. He soon received commissions, first in the Royal Fusiliers, and then as a company commander in the 9th Gurkha Rifles. Beer served in India, staying there until 1947, when he returned to England and was assigned to the Human factors Branch of Operations research at the War Office. In 1949, he was demobilised, having reached the rank of captain.

Beer did not use his given first name &quot;Anthony&quot;, instead preferring his middle name of “Stafford.” His younger brother Ian also shared this middle name. When Ian was sixteen, Beer persuaded his brother to sign a document promising not to use “Stafford” as part of his name because Beer “wanted the ‘copyright’ of [the name] Stafford Beer.”

===United Steel===
In 1956 he joined United Steel and persuaded the management to fund an operational research group, the Department of Operations Research and Cybernetics, which he headed. This was based in Cybor House, and they installed a Ferranti Pegasus computer, the first in the world dedicated to management cybernetics.

===SIGMA===
In 1961 he left United Steel to start an operational research consultancy in partnership with Roger Eddison called SIGMA (Science in General Management). Beer left SIGMA in 1966 to work for a SIGMA client, the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). He left IPC in 1970 to work as an independent consultant, focusing on his growing interest in social systems.

===Cybersyn===

In mid-1971, Beer was approached by Fernando Flores, then a high-ranking member of the Chilean Production Development Corporation (CORFO) in the newly elected socialist government of Salvador Allende, for advice on applying his cybernetic theories to the management of the state-run sector of the Chilean economy.

This led to Beer&#x27;s involvement in the never-completed Cybersyn project, which aimed to use computers and a telex-based communication network to allow the government to maximise production while preserving the autonomy of workers and lower management.

Beer also was reported to have read and been influenced by Leon Trotsky&#x27;s critique of the Soviet bureaucracy. According to another senior member of the Cybersyn team, Herman Schwember, Beer&#x27;s political background and readings completely derived from works written by Trotsky and Trotskyists. Schwember himself disapproved of Trotsky&#x27;s approach. 

Although Cybersyn was abandoned after Allende&#x27;s death during the Pinochet coup in 1973, Beer continued to work in the Americas, consulting for the governments of Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela.

===Later activity===

In the mid-1970s, Beer moved to mid-Wales where he lived in an almost austere style, developing strong interests in poetry and art. In the 1980s he established a second home on the west side of downtown Toronto and lived part of the year in both residences. He was a visiting professor at almost 30 universities and received an earned higher doctorate (DSc) from the University of Sunderland and honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds, the University of St. Gallen, and the University of Valladolid. He was president of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics.

===Falcondale Collection===

In July 1994 Beer ran a residential course at the Falcondale Hotel in Lampeter. Nine sessions were recorded as a video learning resource, and are collectively known as the Falcondale collection. They are available online at the Data Repository of Liverpool John Moores University. The sessions covered art, science and philosophy as well as the practical application of cybernetics in society, government, community, management and business. Transcripts were made of the discussions and are also available from the same repository.

===Family life===
He was married twice, in 1947 to Cynthia Hannaway, and in 1968 to Sallie Steadman. His partner for the last twenty years of his life was Allenna Leonard, a fellow cybernetician. Beer had five sons and two daughters, one of whom is Vanilla Beer, an artist and essayist.

==Work==
===Management cybernetics===
According to Jackson (2000) &quot;Beer was the first to apply cybernetics to management, defining cybernetics as the &quot;science of effective organization&quot;&quot;. In the 1960s and early 1970s &quot;Beer was a prolific writer and an influential practitioner&quot; in management cybernetics. It was during that period that he developed the viable system model, to diagnose the faults in any existing organizational system. In that time Forrester invented systems dynamics, which &quot;held out the promise that the behavior of whole systems could be represented and understood through modeling the dynamical feedback process going on within them&quot;.

===Cybersyn===

During the administration of Salvador Allende in Chile, in the early 1970s, Beer was closely involved with a visionary project, Cybersyn, to apply his cybernetic theories in government. The project&#x27;s ultimate goal was to create a network of computers and communications equipment that would support the management of the state-run sector of Chile&#x27;s economy; at its core would be an operations room where government managers could view important information about economic processes in real time, formulate plans of action, and transmit advice and directives to managers at plants and enterprises in the field. However, consistent with cybernetic principles and the ideals of the Allende government, its designers aimed to preserve worker and lower-management autonomy instead of implementing a top-down system of centralised control. The system used a network of about 500 telex machines located at enterprises throughout the country and in government offices in Santiago, some of which were connected to a government-operated mainframe computer that would receive information on production operations, feed that information into economic modelling software, and report on variables (such as raw material supplies) that were outside normal parameters and might require attention. The project, implemented by a multidisciplinary group of both Chileans and foreigners, reached an advanced prototype stage, but was interrupted by the 1973 coup d&#x27;état.

===Viable System Model===
The Viable System Model (VSM) is a model of the organisational structure of any viable or autonomous system. A viable system is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted cybernetic description that is applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.

===Syntegration and Team Syntegrity===
Syntegrity is a formal model presented by Beer in the 1990s and now is a registered trademark. It is a form of non-hierarchical problem solving that can be used in a small team of 10 to 42 people. It is a business consultation product that is licensed out to consulting firms. The term comes from the words &quot;synergistic&quot; and &quot;tensegrity&quot;.

===POSIWID===

Stafford Beer coined and frequently used the term POSIWID (the purpose of a system is what it does) to refer to the commonly observed phenomenon that the de facto purpose of a system is often at odds with its official purpose. In an address to the University of Valladolid, Spain in October 2001, he said &quot;According to the cybernetician the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic dictum. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, moral judgment or sheer ignorance of circumstances.&quot; This principle has been used to describe Social Machines as intelligent, for example in the case of &quot;games with a purpose&quot;, and it provides a link between AI and cybernetics.

Beer received awards from the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences in 1958, from the United Kingdom Systems Society, the Cybernetics Society, the American Society for Cybernetics, and the Operations Research Society of America.

<text>List of monastic houses in Wales is a catalogue of abbeys, priories, friaries and other monastic religious houses in Wales.

In this article, alien houses are included, as are smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks), and also camerae of the military orders of monks (Templars and Hospitallers). The numerous monastic hospitals &quot;per se&quot; are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have, the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary, preceptory or commandery.

The geographical co-ordinates provided are sourced from details provided by Ordnance Survey publications.

==Overview==

===Article layout===
Communities/provenance: this column shows the status and communities existing at each establishment, together with such dates as have been established as well as the fate of the establishment after dissolution, and the current status of the site.

Formal Name or Dedication: this column shows the formal name of the establishment or the person in whose name the church is dedicated, where known.

Alternative Names: some of the establishments have had alternative names over the course of time. In order to assist in text-searching such alternatives in name or spelling have been provided.

==Abbreviations and key==
Locations with names in &quot;italics&quot; indicate probable duplication (misidentification with another location)or non-existent foundations (either erroneous reference or proposed foundation never implemented).

<text>John Peckham (c. 1230 – 8 December 1292) was a Franciscan friar and Archbishop of Canterbury in the years 1279–1292.

Peckham studied at the University of Paris under Bonaventure, where he later taught theology and became known as a conservative opponent of Thomas Aquinas, especially regarding the nature of the soul. Peckham also studied optics and astronomy - his studies in those subjects were particularly influenced by Roger Bacon and Alhazen. Around 1270, Peckham returned to England, where he taught at the University of Oxford, and was elected the Franciscans provincial minister of England in 1275. After a brief stint in Rome, he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1279. His time as archbishop was marked by efforts to improve discipline in the clergy as well as reorganize the estates of his see. He served King Edward I of England in Wales.

As archbishop, Peckham oversaw attempts to close down Jewish synagogues, punish relapsing Jews from &quot;returning to their vomit&quot;, and associating with Christians. He also opposed the loaning of money at interest and criticised Queen Eleanor of Castile for purchasing and abusing these loans to dispossess nobles of their property.

Before and during his time as archbishop, Peckham wrote several works on optics, philosophy, and theology, as well as writing hymns. Numerous manuscripts of his works survive. On his death, his body was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, but his heart was given to the Franciscans for burial.

==Early life==
Peckham came from a humble family, possibly from Patcham in East Sussex. He was born about 1230 and was educated at Lewes Priory. About 1250, he joined the Franciscan order at Oxford. He then went to the University of Paris, where he studied under Bonaventure and became regent master, or official lecturer, in theology. While at Paris, he wrote a &quot;Commentary on Lamentations&quot;, which sets out two possible sermons.

For years Peckham taught at Paris, where he was in contact with many of the leading scholars of his time, including Thomas Aquinas. He famously debated Thomas on at least two occasions during 1269 and 1270, during which Peckham defended the conservative theological position, and Thomas put forth his views on the soul. The Thomist doctrine of the unity of form was condemned after these debates. His theological works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.

Peckham also studied other fields, however; and was guided by Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon&#x27;s views on the value of experimental science. Where Peckham met Bacon is not known, but it would have been at either Paris or Oxford. Bacon&#x27;s influence can be seen in Peckham&#x27;s works on optics (the &quot;Perspectiva communis&quot;) and astronomy.
In the field of optics, Peckham was influenced by Euclid, Pseudo-Euclid, Aristotle, Augustine, al-Kindi, Avicenna, Alhazen, Grosseteste, and Roger Bacon. Of these, historian David Lindberg argues, &quot;Alhazen is by far the most significant, and Peckham could speak of his intention to &#x27;follow in the footsteps&#x27; of the author&quot;.

==Return to England==
===Reorganization of the archdiocese===
About 1270, he returned to England to teach at Oxford, and was elected provincial minister of the Franciscans in England in 1275. He did not long remain in that post, being summoned to Rome as &quot;lector sacri palatii,&quot; or theological lecturer at the papal palace. It is likely that he composed his &quot;Expositio super Regulam Fratrum Minorum&quot;, a work that included information on preaching, a subject that Peckham felt was of great importance. In 1279 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Pope Nicholas III who had prohibited the election of Robert Burnell, Edward I&#x27;s preferred candidate. He was provided (appointed by the pope to the see) on 25 January 1279 and consecrated on 19 February 1279.

Peckham laid stress on discipline, which often resulted in conflict with his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham&#x27;s specifying that a copy of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may have backed down was that he was in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.

However, Peckham worked hard to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the revenues of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, and because he was a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate, and never managed to clear them.

===Relations with the Welsh===

Notwithstanding his other actions, Peckham&#x27;s relations with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward. In service to King Edward, Peckham formed a low opinion of the Welsh people and laws. Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses as part of his tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. He also found the Welsh clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the Welsh people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the Welsh to be lazy and idle.

As part of his diplomatic duties, Peckham wrote to Llywelyn, and in those letters the archbishop continued his criticisms of the Welsh people, this time condemning their laws as contrary to both the Old and New Testament. Peckham was particularly offended that Welsh laws sought to get parties to homicides or other crimes to settle their differences rather than the process of English law which condemned the criminal.

Peckham also had problems with his subordinate Thomas Bek, who was Bishop of St David&#x27;s in Wales. Bek tried to revive a scheme to make St David&#x27;s independent from Canterbury, and to elevate it to metropolitan status. This had originally been put forth by Gerald of Wales around 1200, but had been defeated by the actions of Hubert Walter, then the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bek did not manage even the four-year fight that Gerald had managed, for Peckham routed him quickly.

===Ecclesiastical matters===
Skirmishes with Edward over clerical privileges, royal power, Peckham&#x27;s use of excommunication, and ecclesiastical taxation continued, but in October 1286, Edward issued a writ entitled &quot;Circumspecte Agatis&quot; which specified what types of cases the ecclesiastical courts could hear. These included moral issues, matrimonial issues, disputes about wills and testaments, the correction of sins, and slander and physical attacks on the clergy.

Peckham was very strict in his interpretations of canon law. He felt that Welsh laws were illogical and conflicted with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include the top of the head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham&#x27;s reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.

At an ecclesiastical council held at Lambeth in 1281, Peckham ordered the clergy to instruct their congregations in doctrine at least four times a year. They were to explain and teach the Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Virtues and the Sacraments. This command was issued as a canon, or law, of the council, and the group is known as the Lambeth Constitutions. Even later these constitutions were collected as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. The six doctrines comprised the minimum theological knowledge the archbishop considered necessary for the laity to know. The constitutions, which were originally in Latin, were the basis and inspiration for pastoral and devotional works throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages, and were eventually translated into English in the 15th century.

The crime of &quot;Pluralism&quot;, i.e. one cleric holding two or more benefices, was one of Peckham&#x27;s targets, as were clerical absenteeism and laxity in the monastic life. His main method of fighting these was a system of visitation of his subordinate dioceses and religious houses, which he used with an unprecedented frequency. This often resulted in conflicts over whether or not the archbishop had jurisdiction to conduct these visits, but Peckham was also papal legate, which added a layer of complexity to the resulting disputes. The numerous legal cases that resulted from his visitation policy strengthened the archiepiscopal court at the expense of the lower courts. Peckham also fought with Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford over the right to visit subordinate clergy. The quarrel involved an appeal over the jurisdiction of the archbishop, that Thomas sent to Rome in 1281, but Thomas died before the case could be decided. Peckham also decreed that the clergy should preach to their flocks at least four times a year.

Peckham often was in conflict with his subordinate bishops, mainly because of his efforts to reform them, but Peckham&#x27;s own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to the problem. He once wrote to Roger de Meyland, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield &quot;These things need your attention, but you have been absent so long that you seem not to care. We therefore order you, on receipt of this letter, to take up residence in your diocese, so that—even if you are not competent to redress spiritual evils—you may at least minister to the temporal needs of the poor.&quot; The historian Richard Southern says that Peckham&#x27;s disputes with his suffragan bishops were &quot;conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill-will&quot;, which probably owed something to a &quot;petulant strain in Peckham&#x27;s character&quot;. Peckham&#x27;s conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a Franciscan, but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs. These strains between the archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority, as well as Edward&#x27;s great need for income.

===Measures against the Jews===

Like many other senior church leaders of the time, Peckham was hostile to the Jews, and regarded them as a danger to Christians. He pushed for greater segregation of Jews from Christians, alongside other contemporary church leaders, including Richard de Gravesend and Richard Swinefield, a number of whom had previously worked alongside Simon de Montfort. He sought to eradicate usury, and to stop Jewish converts from returning to Judaism.

On hearing that the Jews of London were being allowed to build a new Synagogue, &quot;to the confusion of the Christian religion&quot; Peckham lobbied to stop it. On 19 August 1282, he ordered Richard Gravesend, Bishop of London, to compel the Jews of London, using every instrument of ecclesiastical censure, to destroy all their synagogues except one within a brief time period to be determined by the Bishop, claiming that the seven Synagogues they had were &quot;cheating the Christian religion and causing scandal to many&quot;. In a second letter he congratulates the Bishop because the &quot;Judaica perfidia&quot; is being overcome by the bishop&#x27;s attention and vigilance. He confirmed however, that they should be allowed one Synagogue.

In 1281 Peckham complained to Edward that converts to Christianity were backsliding, saying that those &quot;who had converted from the Jewish perfidy to the Christian religion have returned to their vomit, the Jewish superstition&quot;. The following year he report 17 Jewish apostates, and in 1284 Edward gave him a writ for 13 of them to be arrested. They took refuge in the Tower of London, and Robert Burnell refused to take action for fear of endagering relations with the London Jewry; the 13 seem to have escaped punishment. This however was following a pattern set by Peckham&#x27;s superiors; the Pope had been complaining for some time about similar instances.

Peckham also clashed with Queen Eleanor stating to her that her use of loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He warned her servants that: &quot;It is said that the illustrious lady queen, whom you serve, is occupying many manors, lands, and other possessions of nobles, and has made them her own property – lands which the Jews have extorted with usury from Christians under the protection of the royal court.&quot;

In Easter 1285, the prelates, (senior church leaders) of the Province of Canterbury under Peckham&#x27;s leadership drew up complaints to Edward, two of which were regarding what they saw as lax restrictions on Jews. They complained about converts lapsing back to Judaism, and called for a crack down on usury, which although banned since 1275 under the Statute of the Jewry, they believed was still being practiced, asking that &quot;the Jews&#x27; fraud and malice be vigorously opposed&quot;. Edward replied that there was little that could be done,&quot;because of their evilness&quot;. In response, the prelates expressed their shock and stated that the Crown was permitting Jews to &quot;ensnare Christians through usurious contracts and to acquire the manors of nobles through the sink of usury&quot;. Edward was, they said, capable of stopping this &quot;perversity&quot;, and advised that &quot;through the threat of horrible punishments, which our lips will not name, he may strive to punish all userers&quot;.

These concerns were reiterated directly to Peckham in a letter from the Pope Honorius IV, in November 1286, which Peckham and other church leaders used as guidance to make further calls against the Jews in the 1287 Synod of Exeter, again demanding the wearing of Jewish badges, banning Christians from working for Jews, from sharing meals with them, or using Jewish doctors. Jews were to banned from holding public office, or building new synagogues, and were to stay within their own homes on Good Friday.

==Death and legacy==
A number of manuscripts of Peckham&#x27;s works on philosophy and biblical commentary remain extant. Queen Eleanor persuaded him to write for her a scholarly work in French, which was later described as &quot;unfortunately rather a dull and uninspired little treatise.&quot; His poem &quot;Philomena&quot; is considered one of the finest poems written in its time.

Peckham died on 8 December 1292 at Mortlake and was buried in the north transept, or the Martyrdom, of Canterbury Cathedral. His heart, however, was buried with the Franciscans under the high altar of their London church, Greyfriars, London. His tomb still survives. He founded a college at Wingham, Kent in 1286, probably a college of canons serving a church.

<doc id="142605" wikidata="Q2897123" url="?curid=142605" title="Thomas Tollemache">
<text>Lieutenant-General Thomas Tollemache (12 June 1694) was an English Army officer and politician. Beginning his military career in 1673, in 1686 he resigned his commission in protest at the commissioning of Catholic officers into the Army by James II of England. A supporter of military intervention by the Protestant William of Orange against James II, in early 1688 he joined a regiment of the Anglo-Scots Brigade, a mercenary unit in the Dutch States Army.

In November 1688, he accompanied William to England in the Glorious Revolution and shortly afterwards became colonel of the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards and MP for Malmesbury. He fought in Flanders and Ireland during the Nine Years&#x27; War, as well as being appointed Governor of Portsmouth in 1690 and elected for Chippenham in 1692. In 1694, he was badly wounded at the Battle of Camaret; he died of his injuries on 12 June and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Helmingham.

==Early life==
Thomas Tollemache was born in 1651, second son of Sir Lionel Tollemache (1624–1669) of Helmingham Hall, Suffolk and Elizabeth, 2nd Countess of Dysart, whose second husband was John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale. Tollemache never married.

==Military career==
According to his own account, Tollemache spent several years travelling in Europe before returning to England in 1668, when he attended Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, followed by legal training at the Inner Temple. Details of his early military career are unclear; by 1673 he was based in Germany during the Franco-Dutch War, where he served with John Churchill.

In 1678, he was commissioned into the English Army at the rank of captain in the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards, with which he served with the Tangier Garrison, along with Percy Kirke and Charles Trelawny. Although he lost his commission after fighting a duel, in 1685 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the newly formed Royal Fusiliers. In 1686, he resigned in protest at the admission of Catholic officers by James II, and became a leading member of the &quot;Treason Club&quot;, which supported armed intervention by the Protestant William of Orange on behalf of James&#x27; daughter Mary II of England.

He was also associated with the Association of Protestant Officers, whose members included Trelawny, Churchill and Kirke, all of whom opposed James. In early 1688, he joined one of the regiments in the Anglo-Scots Brigade, a long established mercenary unit in the Dutch army and accompanied William of Orange during the November 1688 Glorious Revolution. He was made governor of Portsmouth and colonel of the Coldstream Guards, as well as being elected MP for Malmesbury in 1689.

His regiment was posted to Flanders during the Nine Years&#x27; War, seeing action at the Battle of Walcourt in August 1689. During 1691, he served in Ireland as a major general, fighting at the Battle of Aughrim and the sieges of Athlone and Limerick. Following the Treaty of Limerick which ended the war, he returned to Flanders where he took part in the battles of Steenkirk and Landen.

==Death==

In 1694 Tollemache led an assault on the port of Brest; warned of the proposed attack, the French under Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban reinforced the garrison and strengthened the defences. The ensuing Battle of Camaret was disastrous for the English who were repulsed with heavy losses; Tollemache was wounded and later died of his injuries in Plymouth on 12 June 1694. He was buried in the church of St Mary&#x27;s at Helmingham.

<text>Charles Townley FRS (1 October 1737 – 3 January 1805) was a wealthy English country gentleman, antiquary and collector, a member of the Towneley family. He travelled on three Grand Tours to Italy, buying antique sculpture, vases, coins, manuscripts and Old Master drawings and paintings. Many of the most important pieces from his collection, especially the Townley Marbles (or Towneley Marbles) are now in the British Museum&#x27;s Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The marbles were overshadowed at the time, and still today, by the Elgin Marbles.

==Biography==

Charles Townley was born in England at Towneley Hall, the family seat, near Burnley in Lancashire, on 1 October 1737. He was the eldest son of William Towneley (1714–1741) and Cecilia, daughter and heiress of Ralph Standish of Standish, Lancashire, and granddaughter of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk. From a Catholic family and thus excluded both from public office and from English universities, he was educated at the English College, Douai, and subsequently under John Turberville Needham, the biologist and Roman Catholic priest.

In 1758 he came of age and took up his residence at Towneley Hall, where he made improvements to his estate. In 1765 he left England on the Grand Tour, where he established a base in Rome. He also visited Florence, Southern Italy and Sicily. He returned to London in 1772, but continued to make occasional visits to Italy until 1780. In conjunction with various dealers, including Gavin Hamilton, and Thomas Jenkins, a dealer in antiquities in Rome, he got together a splendid collection of antiquities, known especially for the &quot;Townley Marbles&quot; (or &quot;Towneley&quot;), which was deposited in 1778 in a house built for the purpose in Park Street, now No. 14 Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate, in the West End of London, where he died on 8 January 1805.

His solitary publication was an account of the Ribchester Helmet in &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;, a Roman cavalry helmet found near Towneley Hall, and now in the British Museum. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1791. He became a member of the Society of Dilettanti 1786, and made a trustee of the British Museum in 1791.

A large archive of Townley&#x27;s papers, including diaries, account books, bills, correspondence, and catalogues, was acquired by the British Museum in 1992.

A bust of Townley was made in Carrara marble in 1807 by his associate and friend, sculptor Joseph Nollekens. It shows Townley in herm form – head and neck only, without full shoulders or arms – with a bare neck, dishevelled hair and a pensive expression. The National Heritage Memorial Fund, in whose 2008-9 annual report the bust is described as &quot;masterfully executed&quot;, made a grant of £187,000 to help purchase the bust so that it could be returned to Towneley Hall Museum in the collector&#x27;s former family home on the outskirts of Burnley.

==Townley Collection==

The antiquities collected by Townley, which now constitute the Townley Collection at the British Museum, consists of some 300 items and includes one of the great collections of Graeco-Roman sculptures and other artefacts. Prominent amongst this collection are:

* &quot;The Cannibal&quot; a fragmentary sculpture of two boys fighting over a game of knucklebones identified by Johann Joachim Winckelmann as the &quot;Astragalizontes&quot; by the classical Greek sculptor Polykleitos
* Bust of Clytie, thought by Townley to be Isis emerging from a sacred lotus
* Townley Hadrian
*Townley Antinous
* Cista Mystica
* A relief of Pan with Jupiter and three nymphs holding shells
* Pair of statues of Pan, signed by Marcus Cossutius Cerdo
* Tombstone of the shoemaker Xanthippos
* Townley Caryatid
* &quot;Townley Discobolus&quot; by Myron, from Hadrian&#x27;s Villa
* Townley Greyhounds
* Townley Sphinx
* Townley Vase, from the Villa of Antoninus Pius at Monte Cagnolo
*Townley Venus

When Townley died in 1805 his family sold the collection of marbles, larger bronzes and terracottas to the British Museum for £20,000 – a sum probably a fraction of its original purchase price. The trustees of the museum obtained a parliamentary grant specifically for the purpose. The smaller antiquities, including coins, engraved gems, and pottery, followed in 1814.

Townley fully intended to leave this collection to the British Museum, as indicated in his will. However, shortly before his death he decided to leave it to the care of his brother Edward and his uncle John Townley on the condition that the sculptures should be exhibited in a purpose-built gallery. The gallery was duly constructed, but as the collection of the museum&#x27;s Greek and Roman antiquities grew, it became clear that the old Montague House, the original home of the museum, was too small for its purpose. The old Jacobean mansion and its Palladian-style Townley Gallery were pulled down in 1823 and gradually replaced with grand rooms arranged over two floors around a central courtyard, today&#x27;s quadrangular building.
===Painting by Johann Zoffany===

Charles Townley became the most famous member of the family and another of the treasures now at Towneley is a conversation piece by Johan Zoffany of Townley in his London house surrounded by an imaginary arrangement of his major sculptures (over forty are represented). Engaged in discussion with him are three fellow connoisseurs, the palaeographer Charles Astle, Hon. Charles Francis Greville, F.R.S., and Pierre-François Hugues d&#x27;Hancarville.

Prominent in front are Townley&#x27;s Roman marble of the &quot;Discobolus&quot;, the &quot;Nymph with a Shell&quot;, of which the most famous variant was also in the Borghese collection and a &quot;Faun&quot; of the Barberini type. On a pedestal in front of the fireplace, the &quot;Boys Fighting&quot; from the Barberini collection had been Towneley&#x27;s first major purchase, in 1768 (Winckelmann had identified it as a lost original by Polykleitos). In point of fact, Towneley&#x27;s only Greek original appears to have been the grave relief on the left wall above the &quot;Bust of a Maenad&quot; posed on a wall bracket.

The so-called &quot;Bust of Clytie&quot; perches on the small writing-table, in Zoffany&#x27;s assembly of the Townley marbles. It was extensively reproduced in marble, plaster, and the white bisque porcelain called parian ware for its supposed resemblance to Parian marble. Goethe owned two casts of this. The &quot;Bust of Clytie&quot; was apparently Townley&#x27;s favourite sculpture and the one he took with him when he was forced to flee his home during the anti-Catholic riots of 1780.

The &quot;Townley Venus&quot; on a Roman well-head that serves as drum pedestal had been discovered by Gavin Hamilton at Ostia and quietly shipped out of the Papal States as two fragmentary pieces. The marble Townley Vase, also furtively exported, stands on the bookcase at the rear: it was excavated about 1774 by Gavin Hamilton at Monte Cagnolo.

<text>Smithsonian is a science and nature magazine (and associated website, &quot;SmithsonianMag.com&quot;). It is the official journal published by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., although editorially independent from its parent organization. The first issue was published in 1970. The Smithsonian holds events such as the American Ingenuity Awards, Future Con, and Museum Day.

==History==
The history of &quot;Smithsonian&quot; began when Edward K. Thompson, the retired editor of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, was asked by then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, to produce a magazine &quot;about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested.&quot;

Thompson later recalled that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it &quot;would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers—not unlike the best of the old &quot;Life&quot;.&quot;

In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975—one of the most successful launches of its time. In 1980, Thompson was replaced by Don Moser, who had also worked at &quot;Life&quot;, and circulation reached upwards of two million, in turn, by Carey Winfrey upon his retirement in 2001. Michael Caruso succeeded Carey Winfrey in 2011, and served as editor-in-chief until 2019. Since that time Debra Rosenberg and Terence Monmaney have been editors.

== Events held ==
===&quot;Smithsonian&quot; American Ingenuity Awards===
Every year since 2012, the magazine has sponsored the American Ingenuity Awards, a recognition of innovation in the arts, sciences and technology. Winners have included Bryan Stevenson, Elon Musk, Lin-Manuel Miranda, OK Go, John Krasinski, Dave Eggers, Aziz Ansari, Rosanne Cash, Jeff Bezos, Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and David Lynch.

Presenters have included Stephen Hawking (twice), Stephen Colbert, David Byrne, Herbie Hancock, Erin Brockovich, Ruben Blades, Bill Nye, Art Spiegelman, and Senator Al Franken. The American Ingenuity Award was created by the artist Jeff Koons.

=== Future Con ===
Future Con, formerly The Future is Here, is an annual conference for students and young people interested in science and science fiction, held as part of Washington D.C.&#x27;s Awesome Con.

=== Museum Day ===

Smithsonian arranges Museum Day, alternatively Smithsonian Day, when museums in all 50 U.S. states offer limited free admission. In 2018, over 1,400 museums participated.

The offer includes a free admission for the ticket holder plus one guest and this ticket is specific to the chosen museum only. The intention is for one ticket per person in contrast to the International Museum Day, when participating museums generally offer entirely free admission throughout the day.

In 2023 and 2024, the event was cancelled with no further explanation. the web landing page redirects to the home page of the museum.

<doc id="142610" wikidata="Q1970615" url="?curid=142610" title="Robert Toombs">
<text>Robert Augustus Toombs (July 2, 1810 – December 15, 1885) was an American politician from Georgia, who was an important figure in the formation of the Confederacy. From a privileged background as a wealthy planter and slaveholder, Toombs embarked on a political career marked by effective oratory, although he also acquired a reputation for hard living, disheveled appearance, and irascibility. He was identified with Alexander H. Stephens&#x27;s libertarian wing of secessionist opinion, and in contradiction to the nationalist Jefferson Davis, Toombs believed a civil war to be neither inevitable nor winnable by the South.

Appointed as Secretary of State of the Confederacy (which lacked political parties), Toombs was against the decision to attack Fort Sumter, and resigned from Davis&#x27;s cabinet. He was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army and was wounded at the Battle of Antietam, where he performed creditably. During the 1865 Battle of Columbus, Toombs&#x27;s reluctance to use canister shot on a mixture of Union and Confederate soldiers resulted in the loss of a key bridge in the war&#x27;s final significant action. He avoided detention by traveling to Europe. On his return two years later, he declined to ask for a pardon, and successfully stood for election in Georgia when the Reconstruction era ended in 1877.

==Early life and education==
Born near Washington, Georgia in 1810, Robert Augustus Toombs was the fifth child of Catherine Huling and planter Robert Toombs. He was of English descent. His father died when he was five. After private education, Toombs entered Franklin College at the University of Georgia in Athens when he was fourteen. During his time at Franklin College, Toombs was a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society. After the university chastised Toombs for unbecoming conduct in a card-playing incident,
 he continued his education at Union College, in Schenectady, New York. He graduated there in 1828. He returned to the South to study law at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville.

===Marriage and family===
Shortly after his admission to the Georgia bar, on November 18, 1830, Toombs married his childhood sweetheart, Martha Juliann (&quot;Julia&quot;) DuBose (1813–1883), daughter of Ezekiel DuBose and his wife of Lincoln County, Georgia. They had three children. Lawrence Catlett (1831–1832) died of scarlet fever. Mary Louisa (1833–1855) married and died in childbirth, along with her baby. Sarah (Sallie) (1835–1866) married Dudley M. DuBose, a distant cousin. She died of complications of childbirth, together with her fifth child Julian.

==Early legal and political career==
Toombs was admitted to the Georgia bar and began his legal practice in 1830. He entered politics, gaining election to the Georgia House of Representatives, where he served in 1838. He failed to win re-election, but was elected again in the next term, serving 1840–1841. He failed again to win re-election, but was elected in 1842, serving a third, non-successive term, 1843–1844.

Toombs won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1844, and would win re-election several times. He served several terms in the lower chamber until 1853. In 1852 the state legislature elected him to the US Senate. There Toombs joined his close friend and fellow representative Alexander H. Stephens from Crawfordville, Georgia. Their friendship became a powerful personal and political bond, and they effectively defined and articulated Georgia&#x27;s position on national issues in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Toombs, like Stephens, emerged as a states&#x27; rights partisan and became a national Whig. After that party dissolved, Toombs aided in the creation of the short-lived Constitutional Union Party in the early 1850s.

As did most Whigs, Toombs considered Texas to be the 28th state, but he opposed the Mexican–American War.

==Slaveholdings==

Toombs and his brother Gabriel owned large plantations and operated them using enslaved African Americans. Toombs increased his personal slave holdings as his wealth increased. Toombs owned six slaves in 1840. By 1850, he owned 17 slaves. In 1860, he owned 16 slaves at his Wilkes County plantation, and an additional 32 slaves at his 3,800-acre plantation in Stewart County, Georgia on the Chattahoochee River.

By 1860, Toombs and his wife lived without any other family members in Wilkes County; in the census that year, Toombs owned $200,000 in real estate; the value of his personal property, primarily made up of slaves, totaled $250,000. One of his slaves, Garland H. White, escaped just before the Civil War. He became a soldier and chaplain in the Union Army in 1862. Other slaves were freed by the Union Army as it occupied areas of Georgia. William Gaines and Wesley John Gaines (1840–1912), also former slaves of Toombs, both became church leaders.

==From Unionist to Confederate==
Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, Toombs fought to reconcile national policies with his personal and sectional interests. In common with Alexander H. Stephens and Howell Cobb, he defended Henry Clay&#x27;s Compromise of 1850 against southerners who advocated secession from the Union as the only solution to sectional tensions over slavery, though during the debate leading up to that compromise he had declared, &quot;if by your legislation you seek to drive us from the Territories purchased by the common blood and treasure of the people, and to abolish slavery in the District, thereby attempting to fix a national degradation upon half the States of this confederacy, I am for disunion, and if my physical courage be equal to the maintenance of my convictions of right and duty I will devote all I am and all I have on earth to its consummation.&quot; He denounced the Nashville Convention, opposed the secessionists in Georgia, and helped to frame the famous Georgia platform (1850). His position and that of Southern Unionists during the decade 1850–1860 was pragmatic; he thought secession was impractical.

From 1853 to 1861, Toombs served in the United States Senate. He reluctantly joined the Democratic Party when lack of interest among voters in other states doomed the Constitutional Union Party. Toombs favored the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, the admission of Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution, and the English Bill (1858). However, his faith in the resiliency and effectiveness of the national government to resolve sectional conflicts waned as the 1850s drew to a close.

Toombs was present on May 22, 1856, when Congressman Preston Brooks beat Senator Charles Sumner with a cane on the Senate floor. As Brooks thrashed Sumner, his House allies Laurence M. Keitt and Henry A. Edmundson prevented witnesses from coming to Sumner&#x27;s aid, with Keitt brandishing a pistol to keep them at bay. Senator John J. Crittenden attempted to intervene, and pleaded with Brooks not to kill Sumner. Toombs interceded for Crittenden, begging Keitt not to attack someone who was not a party to the Brooks-Sumner dispute. Later Toombs suggested that he had no issue with Brooks beating Sumner, and in fact approved of it.

On June 24, 1856, Toombs introduced the Toombs Bill, which proposed a constitutional convention in Kansas under conditions that were acknowledged by various anti-slavery leaders as fair. This marked the greatest concessions made by pro-slavery senators during the struggle over Kansas. But the bill did not provide for the submission of the proposed state constitution to popular vote, where, as the vote on the Lecompton Constitution showed, it would have been soundly defeated. The silence on this point of the territorial law, under which the Lecompton Constitution of Kansas was framed in 1857, was the crux of the Lecompton struggle.

According to historian Jacob S. Clawson, he was &quot;a bullish politician whose blend of acerbic wit, fiery demeanor, and political tact aroused the full spectrum of emotions from his constituents and colleagues...[he] could not balance his volatile personality with his otherwise keen political skill.&quot;

Toombs decried what he saw as support in the North for John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859. &quot;The thousands of blind Republicans who do openly approve the treason, murder, and arson of John Brown, get no condemnation from their party for such acts. …It is vain, in face of these injuries, to talk of peace, fraternity, and common country. There is no peace; there is no fraternity; there is no common country; all of us know it.&quot; Toombs declared that the South should &quot;Never permit this Federal Government to pass into the traitors&#x27; hands of the black Republican party. …The enemy is at your door; wait not to meet him at your hearthstone; meet him at the door-sill, and drive him from the Temple of Liberty, or pull down its pillars and involve him in a common ruin.&quot;

== Secession ==

In the presidential campaign of 1860, Toombs supported John C. Breckinridge. After the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln Toombs initially urged caution &quot;to test Republican willingness to do the South justice&quot;. On December 22 Toombs sent a telegram to Georgia that asserted that &quot;secession by March 4 next should be thundered forth from the ballot-box by the united voice of Georgia.&quot; He delivered a farewell address in the US Senate (January 7, 1861) in which he said: &quot;We want no negro equality, no negro citizenship; we want no negro race to degrade our own; and as one man [we] would meet you upon the border with the sword in one hand and the torch in the other.&quot; He returned to Georgia, and with Governor Joseph E. Brown led the fight for secession against Stephens and Herschel V. Johnson (1812–1880). His influence was a powerful factor in inducing the &quot;old-line Whigs&quot; to support immediate secession.

Unlike the crises of 1850, these events galvanized Toombs and energized his ambitions of becoming the president of the new Confederate nation.

==Confederacy==
The selection of Jefferson Davis as chief executive dashed Toombs&#x27;s hopes of holding the high office of the fledgling Confederacy. In Georgia, it was expected the new president would be one of the delegates from Georgia. Toombs had a serious drinking problem which worried fellow delegates, leading him to not be selected. Toombs had no diplomatic skills, but Davis chose him as the Secretary of State. Toombs was the only member of Davis&#x27; administration to express dissent about the Confederacy&#x27;s attack on Fort Sumter.

After reading Lincoln&#x27;s letter to the governor of South Carolina, Toombs said to Davis: 
===Army general===
Within months of his cabinet appointment, a frustrated Toombs resigned to join the Confederate States Army (CSA). He was commissioned as a brigadier general on July 19, 1861, and served first as a brigade commander in the (Confederate) Army of the Potomac, and then in David R. Jones&#x27; division of the Army of Northern Virginia. He commanded troops through the Peninsula Campaign, Seven Days Battles, Northern Virginia Campaign, and Maryland Campaign. He was wounded in the hand at the Battle of Antietam, where he commanded the defense of Burnside&#x27;s Bridge.

Toombs resigned his CSA commission on March 3, 1863. He returned to Georgia, where he became colonel of the 3rd Cavalry of the Georgia Militia. He subsequently served as a brigadier general and adjutant and inspector-general of General Gustavus W. Smith&#x27;s division of the Georgia Militia. He strongly criticized Davis and the Confederate government, opposing conscription and the suspension of habeas corpus. Newspapers warned that he verged on treason. At the Battle of Columbus in 1865, Toombs commanded the defense of the upper bridge.

When the war ended, Davis was arrested at Irwinville, Georgia, on May 10, 1865. On May 14, Union soldiers appeared at Toombs&#x27; home in Washington, Georgia, and demanded his appearance. He escaped into Alabama, thence by boat to New Orleans and by steam to Europe. He reached Paris, France, early in July 1865 along with P.G.T. Beauregard and Julia Colquitt, wife of another Confederate general. They were seeking to avoid arrest and trial as leaders of the Confederacy.

==Final years==
His wife returned to Georgia in late 1866 following the death of their last surviving child, Sallie Toombs DuBose, in Washington County, Georgia. She went to help their widowed son-in-law care for several small children. Toombs missed his wife and returned to Georgia in 1867, but refused to request a pardon from the president. He never regained his right to vote nor hold political office during the Reconstruction era.

However, Toombs resumed his lucrative law practice, in connection with his son-in-law Dudley M. DuBose. The latter was elected in 1870 as a Democratic U.S. Representative and served one term. Toombs gradually resumed political power in Georgia. He funded and dominated the Georgia constitutional convention of 1877, in the year that federal troops were withdrawn from the South. He demonstrated the political skill and temperament that earlier had earned him a reputation as one of Georgia&#x27;s most effective leaders. He gained a populist reputation for attacks on railroads and state investment in them.

==Death==

1883 was a year marked by losses for Toombs. As March began, his son-in-law Dudley M. Dubose had a stroke and died. His long-time political ally, former Confederate Vice-president and Georgia Governor, Alexander H. Stephens, also died. By September, his beloved wife Julia died. After that, he sank into depression, alcoholism, and ultimately became blind.

Toombs died on December 15, 1885. He was buried at Resthaven Cemetery in Wilkes County, Georgia with his wife, his daughter, and son-in-law. Toombs was survived by four grandchildren.

==Legacy==
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources owns the house and land, Wilkes County, Georgia operates the Robert Toombs House in Washington. Georgia also erected a historical marker in Clarkesville, Habersham County, Georgia concerning the Toombs-Bleckly House, which Toombs acquired as a summer residence in 1879 and sold to Georgia Supreme Court justice Logan E. Bleckley five years later, although it burned down in 1897.

These locations were named for Robert Toombs:

*Toombs County, Georgia is named for Robert Toombs.
*Wilkin County, Minnesota was originally Toombs County.
* Toombs Judicial Circuit includes the superior courts of Glascock County, Lincoln County, McDuffie County, Taliaferro County, Warren County, and Wilkes County.
*So is the Georgia town of Toomsboro, though with a slightly altered spelling. 
*Camp Toombs in Toccoa, Georgia, was the training base of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Regiment during World War II and was named after him.
*Robert Toombs Christian Academy , a segregation academy in Lyons, Georgia, is named in his honor.

In addition, two steamships were named for him. The Liberty Ship SS &quot;Robert Toombs&quot; was launched in 1943 by the Southeastern Shipbuilding Corporation and served through World War II and after, eventually being sold for scrap. The troop transport USS &quot;General LeRoy Eltinge&quot; (AP-154) was sold out of federal service to the Waterman Steamship Company and rebuilt as a long hatch general cargo ship in 1968. Renamed the SS &quot;Robert Toombs&quot;, she served with Waterman until being sold for scrap in 1980.

<text>Lathraea (toothwort) is a small genus of five to seven species of flowering plants, native to temperate Europe and Asia. They are parasitic plants on the roots of other plants, and are completely lacking chlorophyll. They are classified in the family Orobanchaceae.


== Etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Lathraea&quot; derives from the ancient greek (), meaning &quot;clandestine&quot;, which is a reference to the fact that it is inconspicuous until it flowers.

== Phylogeny ==
The phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. &quot;Lathraea&quot; is the sister genus to &quot;Rhinanthus&quot;, and then to &quot;Rhynchocorys&quot;. These three genera share phylogenetic affinities with members of the core Rhinantheae: &quot;Bartsia&quot;, &quot;Euphrasia&quot;, &quot;Tozzia&quot;, &quot;Hedbergia&quot;, &quot;Bellardia&quot;, and &quot;Odontites&quot;. &quot;Melampyrum&quot; appears as a more distant relative.

== Species ==

* Common toothwort (&quot;Lathraea squamaria&quot;) is parasitic on the roots of hazel and alder, occasionally on beech, in shady places such as hedge sides. &quot;Lathraea squamaria&quot; is widespread in Europe. The common toothwort is a protocarnivorous plant. Most of the plant consists of a branched whitish underground stem closely covered with thick fleshy colourless leaves, which are bent over so as to hide the under surface; irregular cavities communicating with the exterior are formed in the thickness of the leaf. On the inner walls of these chambers are stalked hairs, which when stimulated by the touch of an insect send out delicate filaments by means of which the insect is killed and digested.
* Purple toothwort (&quot;Lathraea clandestina&quot;) grows on the roots mainly of alder, poplar and willow. At Arduaine Garden in Argyll in the absence of the three well-known hosts it grows on the roots of a variety of ornamental trees and shrubs; in the same garden cats are frequently seen to roll in the flowers and to eat them. It differs from common toothwort in the dark purple flowers being produced one on each stem. Purple toothwort grows in Middle and South Europe: Western Belgium, Western and Central France and Northern Spain, and locally in Central Italy. Elsewhere, especially in the British Isles, the plant is locally naturalized in parks and old gardens and along river banks.
*Rhodope toothwort (&quot;Lathraea rhodopaea&quot;) is common in the Rhodope Mountains and Rila mountain range in southeastern Europe.

== Cultural references ==
In Pavel Ivanovich Melnikov&#x27;s &quot;In the Forests&quot; a Russian wise woman (&quot;znakharka&quot;) calls this plant Peter&#x27;s Cross and says it protects against devils but only if collected with a prayer to God.

== Notes ==

==Overview==

===Article layout===
The list is presented alphabetically by County. Foundations are listed alphabetically within each county.

Communities/provenance: shows the status and communities existing at each establishment, together with such dates as have been established as well as the fate of the establishment after dissolution, and the current status of the site.

Formal Name or Dedication: shows the formal name of the establishment or the person in whose name the church is dedicated, where known.

Alternative Names: some of the establishments have had alternative names over the course of time. In order to assist in text-searching such alternatives in name or spelling have been provided.

In this article smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks) and camerae of the military orders of monks (Templars and Hospitallers) are included. The numerous monastic hospitals per se are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have, the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or preceptory/commandery.

<text>Funny Money is a farce written by Ray Cooney. It premièred at The Churchill Theatre, Bromley, London, England, in 1994, followed by a successful two-year run in the West End. Cooney directed his own play and also played the part of Henry Perkins. In 2006 the play was adapted into a movie starring Chevy Chase. The play has also been presented internationally in Singapore, in May 2005, by the British Theatre Playhouse.

==Plot summary==
On his birthday, middle-aged Henry Perkins is going home to Fulham on the underground, looking forward to his birthday dinner, for which he and his wife Jean have invited their old friends, Vic and Betty Johnson. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened so far, but on the tube train he by mistake picks up a wrong briefcase without noticing it. He gets off at Fulham Broadway, wants to get out his gloves and scarf and realises that he is actually carrying someone else&#x27;s briefcase. In it, he finds £735,000 in used £50 notes. He goes to a pub and counts the money several times in one of the booths of the gents. &quot;Bent copper&quot; Davenport—in plain clothes—watches the excited man and believes he has come to the pub to solicit men.

When Henry Perkins reaches his home, Vic and Betty are just arriving. He is planning to just grab a few things and hurry off to Barcelona with his wife and the money, leaving his old life behind. As it is Friday night, and he knows that it will take whoever has his own briefcase only till Monday morning to phone his office and get his address—and he wants to be long gone by then. He knows very well that all the money in the briefcase must be part of some criminal transaction, so from a moral point of view he has no bad conscience whatsoever.

Foreseeably, unforeseeable events intervene. While he is still explaining to his reluctant wife that they have to leave in a hurry, Davenport—whom Henry does not recognise from the pub—arrives and wants to have a talk with him. Of course Henry thinks this is about the money, and a whole series of (deliberately) mistaken identities ensues, which also includes Vic and Betty, who are introduced to Davenport as relatives of the Perkinses on their way home to Australia. Bill, the taxi driver Henry has called to drive his wife and himself to Heathrow, adds to the confusion.

At the same time, &quot;Mr Nasty&quot;—the man whose briefcase Henry accidentally took on the underground—is killed by &quot;Mr Big&quot;—the man he had criminal dealings with—and thrown into the Thames near Putney Bridge—which is quite close to Fulham --, together with Henry&#x27;s briefcase (which contains, among other things, a cheese and chutney sandwich). &quot;Mr Big&quot;, a Dutchman who does not speak English, keeps phoning the Perkinses but remains monosyllabic throughout his calls (&quot;Brerfcurse&quot;). When Bill answers the phone, he gives the caller the exact address—not knowing what a big mistake he is making. Immediately after the call, &quot;Mr Big&quot; starts walking towards the Perkinses&#x27; Fulham house.

In the meantime, another policeman arrives at the Perkinses&#x27;: It is Slater (who does not know Davenport, neither personally nor by name), who has come to inform Jean Perkins that her husband&#x27;s body has been fished out of the river (really Mr. Nasty, who happened to have Henry&#x27;s briefcase with him when Mr. Big shot him). He wants to take her with him to the mortuary to identify her husband. This leads to yet another series of mistaken identities on top of the first one, with Henry Perkins—who is supposed to be dead, waiting to be identified—posing as his brother Freddy, also from Australia.

Slater is kept waiting endlessly—both outside and inside the house. Jean, who used to be a teetotaller, is completely drunk by now since she has been hitting the brandy. In the course of events, Davenport turns out to be a bent copper who demands ten percent of the money for keeping his mouth shut. He is introduced to Slater as yet another brother of &quot;Percy&#x27;s&quot; called Archie. There is continuous coming and going and also one or two mix-ups as far as the briefcases are concerned. As Jean still does not want to go to &quot;Barlecona&quot;, Betty offers herself as Henry&#x27;s travelling companion (and more). It looks like wife-swapping to all of them, with Vic staying behind with Jean and her cat. Eventually, however, they all decide to go to Barcelona, with Davenport joining the two couples as their bodyguard and Bill joining them as their gardener.

When they finally want to get away, &quot;Mr Brerfcurse&quot; arrives with a gun. He has been slightly injured in a car accident caused by Bill in his taxi and Slater in his police car, both waiting round the corner. Some shooting goes on in the house, but eventually the Dutchman can be overwhelmed. An ambulance is called. Henry Perkins confesses everything, including all the assumed identities, to Slater. After Slater has arrested the Dutchman and led him away, Henry willy-nilly readjusts to the old status quo and wants to have his birthday dinner after all. This is when Bill, the taxi driver, informs the two couples that he has secretly put the money into one of the suitcases. The chicken is burned, but in the end they do have the money.

<doc id="142615" wikidata="Q188569" url="?curid=142615" title="William Godwin">
<text>William Godwin (3 March 1756 – 7 April 1836) was an English journalist, political philosopher and novelist. He is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism and the first modern proponent of anarchism. Godwin is most famous for two books that he published within the space of a year: &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot;, an attack on political institutions, and &quot;Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams&quot;, an early mystery novel which attacks aristocratic privilege. Based on the success of both, Godwin featured prominently in the radical circles of London in the 1790s. He wrote prolifically in the genres of novels, history and demography throughout his life.

In the conservative reaction to British radicalism, Godwin was attacked, in part because of his marriage to the feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 and his candid biography of her after her death from childbirth. Their daughter, later known as Mary Shelley, would go on to write &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and marry the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. With his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, Godwin set up The Juvenile Library, allowing the family to write their own works for children (sometimes using &quot;noms de plume&quot;) and translate and publish many other books, some of enduring significance. Godwin has had considerable influence on British literature and literary culture.

== Early life and education ==
Godwin was born in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, to John and Anne Godwin, becoming the seventh of his parents&#x27; thirteen children. Godwin&#x27;s family on both sides were middle-class and his parents adhered to a strict form of Calvinism. Godwin&#x27;s mother came from a wealthy family but due to her uncle&#x27;s frivolities the family wealth was squandered. Fortunately for the family, her father was a successful merchant involved in the Baltic Sea trade. Shortly following William&#x27;s birth, his father John, a Nonconformist minister, moved the family to Debenham in Suffolk and later to Guestwick in Norfolk, which had a radical history as a Roundhead stronghold during the English Civil War. At the local meeting house, John Godwin often found himself sitting in &quot;Cromwell&#x27;s Chair&quot;, which had been a gift to the town by the Lord Protector.

William Godwin came from a long line of English Dissenters, who faced religious discrimination by the British government, and was inspired by his grandfather and father to take up the dissenting tradition and become a minister himself. At eleven years old, he became the sole pupil of Samuel Newton, a hard-line Calvinist and a disciple of Robert Sandeman. Although Newton&#x27;s strict method of discipline left Godwin with a lasting anti-authoritarianism, Godwin internalized the Sandemanian creed, which emphasised rationalism, egalitarianism and consensus decision-making. Despite Godwin&#x27;s later renunciation of Christianity, he maintained his Sandemanian roots, which he held responsible for his commitment to rationalism, as well as his stoic personality. Godwin later characterised Newton as, &quot;... a celebrated north country apostle, who, after Calvin damned ninety-nine in a hundred of mankind, has contrived a scheme for damning ninety-nine in a hundred of the followers of Calvin.&quot; In 1771, Godwin was finally dismissed by Newton and returned home, but his father died the following year, which prompted his mother to urge him to continue his education.

At seventeen years old, Godwin began higher education at the Dissenting Academy in Hoxton, where he studied under Andrew Kippis, the biographer, and Abraham Rees, who was responsible for the &quot;Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot;. A hotspot for classical liberalism, at the Academy, Godwin familiarized himself with John Locke&#x27;s approach to psychology, Isaac Newton&#x27;s scientific method and Francis Hutcheson&#x27;s ethical system, which all informed Godwin&#x27;s philosophies of determinism and immaterialism. Although Godwin had joined the Academy as a committed Tory, the outbreak of the American Revolution led him to support the Whig opposition and, after reading the works of Jonathan Swift, he became a staunch republican. He soon familiarised himself with the French &quot;philosophes&quot;, learning of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s belief in the inherent goodness of human nature and opposition to private property, as well as Claude Adrien Helvétius&#x27;s utilitarianism and Paul-Henri Thiry&#x27;s materialism.

In 1778, Godwin graduated from the academy and was quickly appointed as a minister in Ware, where he met Joseph Fawcett, one of his main direct influences. By 1780, he had been reassigned to Stowmarket, where he first read Paul-Henri Thiry&#x27;s &quot;System of Nature&quot;, adopting his philosophies of determinism and materialism. But after a conflict with other dissenting ministers of Suffolk over the administration of the eucharist, he stepped down and left for London in April 1782, resigning his career as a minister to become a writer.

== Early writing ==
Throughout 1783, Godwin published a series of written works, beginning with an anonymously-published biography of William Pitt the Elder, followed by a couple of pro-Whig political pamphlets. He also briefly attempted to return to ministerial work in Beaconsfield, where he preached that &quot;faith should be subordinated to reason&quot;. A few months later, during the opening of a seminary in Epsom, Godwin gave a politically-charged speech in which he denounced state power as &quot;artificial&quot; and exalted the libertarian potential of education, which he believed could bring an end to authoritarian governments. Godwin then worked for a spell as a satirical literary critic, publishing &quot;The Herald of Literature&quot;, in which he reviewed non-existent works by real authors, imitating their writing styles in lengthy quotations.

His work on the &quot;Herald&quot; secured him further work as a critic for John Murray&#x27;s &quot;English Review&quot; and a commission to translate Simon Fraser&#x27;s memoirs. In 1784, he published the romantic novels &quot;Damon and Delia&quot; and &quot;Imogen&quot;, the latter of which was framed as a translation of a found manuscript from ancient Wales. That same year, he also published &quot;Sketches of History&quot;, which compiled six of his sermons about the characters of Aaron, Hazael and Jesus. Drawing from John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which depicted Satan as a rebel against his creator, Godwin denounced the Christian God as a theocrat and a tyrant that had no right to rule.

As his early works were financially unsuccessful, in 1784, William Godwin hoped John Collins, a wealthy owner of a sugar plantation in St. Vincent would fund his writing. He did not succeed but the close connection between Godwin and members of the Collins family continued for fifty years. John Collin&#x27;s eldest daughter Harriet de Boinville and William met seventy-two times between 1809 and 1827, and she championed Godwin&#x27;s &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and Its Influence on Morals and Happiness&quot; (1793) at her salons during that time period.

In further attempts to earn money, Godwin started writing for well-paying Whig journals on Grub Street, starting work as a political journalist for the &quot;New Annual Register&quot; after being introduced to Georgie Robinson by Andrew Kippis. Godwin&#x27;s work was then picked up by the &quot;Political Herald&quot;, where he wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Mucius&quot; in order to attack the Tories. He subsequently reported on the Pitt ministry&#x27;s colonial rule in Ireland and India; penned a history of the Dutch Revolt and predicted the outbreak of a revolutionary wave in Europe.

After the death of the &quot;Political Herald&#x27;s&quot; editor, Godwin turned down Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s offer of succeeding to the editorship, out of concern that his editorial independence would be compromised by a direct financial connection to the Whig Party. But it was through Sheridan that Godwin became acquainted with a life-long friend Thomas Holcroft, whose arguments convinced Godwin to finally reject Christianity and embrace atheism. At the same time, Godwin took up a side job as a tutor for the young Thomas Abthorpe Cooper. After a fractious relationship between the two, Godwin eventually became the orphaned boy&#x27;s adoptive father, which altered his style of pedagogy to one that emphasised &quot;an open and honest relationship between tutor and pupil.&quot;

With the outbreak of the French Revolution, Godwin was among the Radicals that enthusiastically welcomed the events as the spiritual successor to Britain&#x27;s own Glorious Revolution of 1688. As a member of the Revolution Society, Godwin met the political activist Richard Price, whose &quot;Discourse on the Love of Our Country&quot; espoused a radical form of patriotism that controversially upheld freedom of religion, representative democracy and the right of revolution. Price&#x27;s &quot;Discourse&quot; ignited a pamphlet war, beginning with Edmund Burke&#x27;s publication of his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;, which defended traditionalist conservatism and opposed revolution. In response to Burke, Thomas Paine published his &quot;Rights of Man&quot; with the help of Godwin, who declared that &quot;the seeds of revolution it contains are so vigorous in their stamina, that nothing can overpower them.&quot;

But Godwin&#x27;s voice remained largely absent from the Revolution Controversy, as he had started writing a work of political philosophy that developed on his radical principles. With George Robinson&#x27;s financial support, Godwin quit his work at the &quot;New Annual Register&quot; and committed himself wholly to his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, which he hoped would condense the &quot;best and most liberal in the science of politics into a coherent system&quot;. After sixteen months&#x27; work, while the revolution in France had culminated with the execution of Louis XVI and the outbreak of war, Godwin published his &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; in February 1793.

==Marriage to Mary Wollstonecraft==

Godwin first met Mary Wollstonecraft at the home of their mutual publisher. Joseph Johnson was hosting a dinner for another of his authors, Thomas Paine, and Godwin remarked years later that on that evening he heard too little of Paine and too much of Wollstonecraft; he did not see her again for some years. In the interim, Wollstonecraft went to live in France to witness the Revolution for herself, and had a child, Fanny Imlay, with an American adventurer named Gilbert Imlay. In pursuit of Gilbert Imlay&#x27;s business affairs, Wollstonecraft travelled to Scandinavia, and soon afterwards published a book based on the voyage. Godwin read it, and later wrote that &quot;If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.&quot;

When Godwin and Wollstonecraft were reintroduced in 1796, their respect for each other soon grew into friendship, sexual attraction, and love. Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be considered legitimate by society. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in &quot;Political Justice&quot;. After their marriage at St. Pancras on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses in Somers Town so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by notes delivered by servants.

Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was born in Somers Town on 30 August 1797, the couple&#x27;s only child. Godwin had hoped for a son and had been planning on naming the child &quot;William&quot;. On 10 September 1797 Wollstonecraft died of complications following the birth. By all accounts, it had been a happy and stable, though brief, relationship. Now Godwin, who had been a bachelor until a few months before, was distraught at the loss of the love of his life. Simultaneously, he became responsible for the care of these two young girls, the new-born Mary and toddler Fanny.

When Mary was three years old, Godwin left his daughters in the care of James Marshall while he travelled to Ireland. Godwin&#x27;s tone in his letters demonstrates how much he cared about them. His letters show the stress he placed on giving his two daughters a sense of security. &quot;And now what shall I say for my poor little girls? I hope they have not forgot me. I think of them every day, and should be glad, if the wind was more favourable, to blow them a kiss a-piece from Dublin to the Polygon.. but I have seen none that I love so well or think half so good as my own.&quot;

In December 1800 his play &quot;Antonio, or the Soldier&#x27;s Return&quot; was put on at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane without success.

==Second marriage and book publishing==
In 1801, Godwin married his neighbour Mary Jane Clairmont. She brought two of her own children into the household, Charles and Claire. Journalist H.N. Brailsford wrote in 1913, &quot;She was a vulgar and worldly woman, thoroughly feminine, and rather inclined to boast of her total ignorance of philosophy.&quot; While Fanny eventually learned to live with Clairmont, Mary&#x27;s relationship with her stepmother was tense. Mary writes, &quot;As to Mrs Godwin, something very analogous to disgust arises whenever I mention her&quot;, &quot;A woman I shudder to think of&quot;.

In 1805, the Godwins set up a shop and publishing house called the Juvenile Library, significant in the history of children&#x27;s literature. Through this, Godwin wrote children&#x27;s primers on Biblical and classical history, and using the pseudonym &quot;Edward Baldwin&quot;, he wrote a variety of books for children, including a version of Jack and the Beanstalk, and a biography of the Irish artist William Mulready, who illustrated works for them. They kept alive family ties, publishing the first book by Margaret King (then Lady Mount Cashell), who had been a favoured pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. They published works never since out of print, such as Charles and Mary Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot;. The Juvenile Library also translated European authors. The first English edition of &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was translated (from the French, not the German) and edited by them. The business was the family&#x27;s mainstay for decades.

In 1807 his tragedy &quot;Faulkener&quot; was performed at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane without more success than his earlier play.

==Children==
The eldest of Godwin&#x27;s children was Fanny Imlay (1794–1816), who committed suicide as a young woman. Charles Gaulis Clairmont ended up as Chair of English literature at Vienna University and taught sons of the royal family; news of his sudden death in 1849 distressed Maximilian. Mary Godwin (1797–1851) gained fame as Mary Shelley, author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Half a year younger than her was Claire Clairmont, Mary Jane&#x27;s only daughter, to whom she showed favouritism. The youngest, and the only child of the second marriage, was William Godwin the Younger (1803–1832). Godwin sent him first to Charterhouse School and then to various other establishments of a practical bent. Nonetheless, he eventually earned his living by the pen. He died at 29, leaving the manuscript of a novel, which Godwin saw into print. All of Godwin&#x27;s children who lived into adulthood worked as writers or educators, carrying on his legacy and that of his wives. Only two of them had children who in turn survived: Percy Florence Shelley, and the son and daughter of Charles. Godwin did not welcome the birth of Allegra Byron, but Claire&#x27;s only child died aged five.

Godwin had high hopes for Mary, giving her a more rigorous intellectual experience than most women of her period, and describing her as &quot;very intelligent&quot;. He wished to give his daughter a more &quot;masculine education&quot; and prepared her to be a writer. However, Godwin withdrew his support as Mary became a woman and pursued her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Mathilda&quot;, may be seen as a reaction to her childhood. Both explore the role of the father in the child&#x27;s socialisation and the control the father has on the child&#x27;s future. Shelley&#x27;s last two novels, &quot;Lodore&quot; and &quot;Falkner&quot;, re-evaluate the father-daughter relationship. They were written at a time when Shelley was raising her only surviving child alone and supporting her ageing father. In both novels, the daughter eludes the father&#x27;s control by giving him the traditional maternal figure he asks for. This relationship gives the daughter control of the father.

==Later years and death==
Godwin was awarded a sinecure position as Office Keeper and Yeoman Usher of the Receipt of the Exchequer, which came with grace and favour accommodation in New Palace Yard, part of the complex of the Palace of Westminster, i.e. the Houses of Parliament. One of his duties was to oversee the sweeping of the chimneys of these extensive buildings. On 16 October 1832, a fire broke out and most of the Palace burned down. Literary critic Marilyn Butler concluded her review of a 1980 biography of Godwin by comparing him favourably to Guy Fawkes: Godwin was more successful in his opposition to the status quo.

In later years, Godwin came to expect support and consolation from his daughter. Two of the five children he had raised had pre-deceased him, and two more lived abroad. Mary responded to his expectations and she cared for him until he died in 1836.

In 1836, Harriet de Boinville described Godwin&#x27;s death, in a letter to his daughter Mary, as &quot;the extinction of a mastermind. ... Everything is interesting which relates to such a man, one of the gifted few under whose moral influences society is now vibrating.&quot;

==Legacy and memorials==

Godwin was buried next to Mary Wollstonecraft in the graveyard of St Pancras, the church where they had married in 1797. His second wife outlived him, and eventually was buried there too. The three share a gravestone. In the 1850s, Mary Shelley&#x27;s only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley, had the remains of Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved from what had become a run-down area of the capital to the more salubrious surroundings of Bournemouth, to his family tomb at St Peter&#x27;s Church.

The surviving manuscripts for many of Godwin&#x27;s best-known works are held in the Forster Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The V&amp;A&#x27;s manuscripts for &quot;Political Justice&quot; and &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; were both digitised in 2017 and are now included in the Shelley-Godwin Archive.

His birthplace, Wisbech, has two memorials to him. A cul-de-sac was named in his honour Godwin Close, and a wall plaque adorns a building adjacent to the Angles Theatre in Alexandra Road.

==Works and ideas==
=== &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; and &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; ===
In 1793, while the French Revolution was in full swing, Godwin published his great work on political science, &quot;Enquiry concerning Political Justice, and its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness&quot;. The first part of this book was largely a recap of Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of Natural Society&quot; – a critique of the state. Godwin acknowledged the influence of Burke for this portion. The rest of the book is Godwin&#x27;s positive vision of how an anarchist (or minarchist) society might work. &quot;Political Justice&quot; was extremely influential in its time: after the writings of Burke and Paine, Godwin&#x27;s was the most popular written response to the French Revolution. Godwin&#x27;s work was seen by many as illuminating a middle way between the fiery extremes of Burke and Paine. Prime Minister William Pitt famously said that there was no need to censor it, because at over £1 it was too costly for the average Briton to buy. However, as was the practice at the time, numerous &quot;corresponding societies&quot; took up &quot;Political Justice&quot;, either sharing it or having it read to the illiterate members. Eventually, it sold over 4000 copies and brought literary fame to Godwin.

Godwin augmented the influence of &quot;Political Justice&quot; with the publication of a novel that proved equally popular, &quot;Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams&quot;. This tells the story of a servant who finds out a dark secret about Falkland, his aristocratic master, and is forced to flee because of his knowledge. &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; is essentially the first thriller: Godwin wryly remarked that some readers were consuming in a night what took him over a year to write. Not the least of its merits is a portrait of the justice system of England and Wales at the time and a prescient picture of domestic espionage. His literary method, as he described it in the introduction to the novel, also proved influential: Godwin began with the conclusion of Caleb being chased through Britain, and developed the plot backwards. Dickens and Poe both commented on Godwin&#x27;s ingenuity in doing this.

=== Political writing ===
In response to a treason trial of some of his fellow British Jacobins, among them Thomas Holcroft, Godwin wrote &quot;Cursory Strictures on the Charge Delivered by Lord Chief Justice Eyre to the Grand Jury, 2 October 1794&quot; in which he forcefully argued that the prosecution&#x27;s concept of &quot;constructive treason&quot; allowed a judge to construe &quot;any&quot; behaviour as treasonous. It paved the way for a major victory for the Jacobins, as they were acquitted.

However, Godwin&#x27;s own reputation was eventually besmirched after 1798 by the conservative press, in part because he chose to write a candid biography of his late wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, entitled &quot;Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;, including accounts of her two suicide attempts and her affair (before her relationship with Godwin) with the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, which resulted in the birth of Fanny Imlay.

Godwin, stubborn in his practice, practically lived in secret for 30 years because of his reputation. However, in its influence on writers such as Shelley, who read the work on multiple occasions between 1810 and 1820, and Kropotkin, &quot;Political Justice&quot; takes its place with Milton&#x27;s &quot;Areopagitica&quot; and Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as a defining anarchist and libertarian text.

=== Interpretation of political justice ===
By &quot;political justice&quot;, the author meant &quot;the adoption of any principle of morality and truth into the practice of a community,&quot; and the work was therefore an inquiry into the principles of society, government, and morals. For many years Godwin had been &quot;satisfied that monarchy was a species of government unavoidably corrupt,&quot; and from desiring a government of the simplest construction, he gradually came to consider that &quot;government by its very nature counteracts the improvement of original mind,&quot; demonstrating anti-statist beliefs that would later be considered anarchist.

Believing in the perfectibility of the human race, that there are no innate principles, and therefore no original propensity to evil, he considered that &quot;our virtues and our vices may be traced to the incidents which make the history of our lives, and if these incidents could be divested of every improper tendency, vice would be extirpated from the world.&quot; All control of man by man was more or less intolerable, and the day would come when each man, doing what seems right in his own eyes, would also be doing what is in fact best for the community, because all will be guided by principles of pure reason.

Such optimism was combined with a strong empiricism to support Godwin&#x27;s belief that the evil actions of men are solely reliant on the corrupting influence of social conditions, and that changing these conditions could remove the evil in man. This is similar to the ideas of his wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, concerning the shortcomings of women as due to discouragement during their upbringing.

Peter Kropotkin remarked of Godwin that when &quot;speaking of property, he stated that the rights of every one &#x27;to every substance capable of contributing to the benefit of a human being&#x27; must be regulated by justice alone: the substance must go &#x27;to him who most wants it&#x27;. His conclusion was communism.&quot;

=== Debate with Malthus ===
In 1798, Thomas Robert Malthus wrote &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; in response to Godwin&#x27;s views on the &quot;perfectibility of society&quot;. Malthus wrote that populations are inclined to increase in times of plenty, and that only distress, from causes such as food shortages, disease, or war, serves to stem population growth. Populations in his view are therefore always doomed to grow until distress is felt, at least by the poorer segment of the society. Consequently, poverty was felt to be an inevitable phenomenon of society.Let us imagine for a moment Mr. Godwin&#x27;s beautiful system of equality realized in its utmost purity, and see how soon this difficulty might be expected to press under so perfect a form of society... Let us suppose all the causes of misery and vice in this island removed. War and contention cease. Unwholesome trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds no longer collect together in great and pestilent cities... Every house is clean, airy, sufficiently roomy, and in a healthy situation... And the necessary labours of agriculture are shared amicably among all. The number of persons, and the produce of the island, we suppose to be the same as at present. The spirit of benevolence, guided by impartial justice, will divide this produce among all the members of the society according to their wants...With these extraordinary encouragements to population, and every cause of depopulation, as we have supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known...

Malthus went on to argue that under such ideal conditions, the population could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in for the support of the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.

In &quot;Political Justice&quot; Godwin had acknowledged that an increase in the standard of living as he envisioned could cause population pressures, but he saw an obvious solution to avoiding distress: &quot;project a change in the structure of human action, if not of human nature, specifically the eclipsing of the desire for sex by the development of intellectual pleasures&quot;. In the 1798 version of his essay, Malthus specifically rejected this possible change in human nature. In the second and subsequent editions, however, he wrote that widespread &quot;moral restraint,&quot; i.e., postponement of marriage and pre-nuptial celibacy (sexual abstinence), could reduce the tendency of a population to grow until distress was felt.
Godwin also saw new technology as being partly responsible for the future change in human nature into more intellectually developed beings. He reasoned that increasing technological advances would lead to a decrease in the amount of time individuals spent on production and labour, and thereby, to more time spent on developing &quot;their intellectual and moral faculties&quot;. Instead of population growing exponentially, Godwin believed that this moral improvement would outrun the growth of population. Godwin pictured a social utopia where society would reach a level of sustainability and engage in &quot;voluntary communism&quot;.

In July 1820, Godwin published &quot;Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind&quot; as a rebuttal to Malthus&#x27; essays. Godwin&#x27;s main argument was against Malthus&#x27; notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted had occurred in the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple would have to have at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus&#x27;s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.

=== Interest in earthly immortality ===
In his first edition of &quot;Political Justice&quot; Godwin included arguments favouring the possibility of &quot;earthly immortality&quot; (what would now be called physical immortality), but later editions of the book omitted this topic. Although the belief in such a possibility is consistent with his philosophy regarding perfectibility and human progress, he probably dropped the subject because of political expedience when he realised that it might discredit his other views.

<doc id="142616" wikidata="Q2920416" url="?curid=142616" title="Kernel (category theory)">
<text>In category theory and its applications to other branches of mathematics, kernels are a generalization of the kernels of group homomorphisms, the kernels of module homomorphisms and certain other kernels from algebra. Intuitively, the kernel of the morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is the &quot;most general&quot; morphism &quot;k&quot; : &quot;K&quot; → &quot;X&quot; that yields zero when composed with (followed by) &quot;f&quot;.

Note that kernel pairs and difference kernels (also known as binary equalisers) sometimes go by the name &quot;kernel&quot;; while related, these aren&#x27;t quite the same thing and are not discussed in this article.

==Definition==
Let C be a category.
In order to define a kernel in the general category-theoretical sense, C needs to have zero morphisms.
In that case, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is an arbitrary morphism in C, then a kernel of &quot;f&quot; is an equaliser of &quot;f&quot; and the zero morphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;.
In symbols:
:ker(&quot;f&quot;) = eq(&quot;f&quot;, 0&quot;XY&quot;)

To be more explicit, the following universal property can be used. A kernel of &quot;f&quot; is an object &quot;K&quot; together with a morphism &quot;k&quot; : &quot;K&quot; → &quot;X&quot; such that:
* &quot;f&quot;∘&quot;k&quot; is the zero morphism from &quot;K&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;;

* Given any morphism &#x27; : &#x27; → &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;∘&#x27; is the zero morphism, there is a unique morphism &quot;u&quot; : &#x27; → &quot;K&quot; such that &quot;k&quot;∘&quot;u&quot; = &quot;&quot;.

As for every universal property, there is a unique isomorphism between two kernels of the same morphism, and the morphism &quot;k&quot; is always a monomorphism (in the categorical sense). So, it is common to talk of &quot;the&quot; kernel of a morphism. In concrete categories, one can thus take a subset of &quot;&quot; for &quot;K&quot;, in which case, the morphism &quot;k&quot; is the inclusion map. This allows one to talk of &quot;K&quot; as the kernel, since &quot;k&quot; is implicitly defined by &quot;K&quot;. There are non-concrete categories, where one can similarly define a &quot;natural&quot; kernel, such that &quot;K&quot; defines &quot;k&quot; implicitly.

Not every morphism needs to have a kernel, but if it does, then all its kernels are isomorphic in a strong sense: if &quot;k&quot; : &quot;K&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and are kernels of &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, then there exists a unique isomorphism φ : &quot;K&quot; → &quot;L&quot; such that ∘φ = &quot;k&quot;.

==Examples==
Kernels are familiar in many categories from abstract algebra, such as the category of groups or the category of (left) modules over a fixed ring (including vector spaces over a fixed field). To be explicit, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is a homomorphism in one of these categories, and &quot;K&quot; is its kernel in the usual algebraic sense, then &quot;K&quot; is a subalgebra of &quot;X&quot; and the inclusion homomorphism from &quot;K&quot; to &quot;X&quot; is a kernel in the categorical sense.

Note that in the category of monoids, category-theoretic kernels exist just as for groups, but these kernels don&#x27;t carry sufficient information for algebraic purposes. Therefore, the notion of kernel studied in monoid theory is slightly different (see #Relationship to algebraic kernels below).

In the category of unital rings, there are no kernels in the category-theoretic sense; indeed, this category does not even have zero morphisms. Nevertheless, there is still a notion of kernel studied in ring theory that corresponds to kernels in the category of non-unital rings.

In the category of pointed topological spaces, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is a continuous pointed map, then the preimage of the distinguished point, &quot;K&quot;, is a subspace of &quot;X&quot;. The inclusion map of &quot;K&quot; into &quot;X&quot; is the categorical kernel of &quot;f&quot;.
==Relation to other categorical concepts==
The dual concept to that of kernel is that of cokernel.
That is, the kernel of a morphism is its cokernel in the opposite category, and vice versa.

As mentioned above, a kernel is a type of binary equaliser, or difference kernel.
Conversely, in a preadditive category, every binary equaliser can be constructed as a kernel.
To be specific, the equaliser of the morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is the kernel of the difference &quot;g&quot; − &quot;f&quot;.
In symbols:
:eq (&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) = ker (&quot;g&quot; − &quot;f&quot;).
It is because of this fact that binary equalisers are called &quot;difference kernels&quot;, even in non-preadditive categories where morphisms cannot be subtracted.

Every kernel, like any other equaliser, is a monomorphism.
Conversely, a monomorphism is called &quot;normal&quot; if it is the kernel of some morphism.
A category is called &quot;normal&quot; if every monomorphism is normal.

Abelian categories, in particular, are always normal.
In this situation, the kernel of the cokernel of any morphism (which always exists in an abelian category) turns out to be the image of that morphism; in symbols:
:im &quot;f&quot; = ker coker &quot;f&quot; (in an abelian category)
When &quot;m&quot; is a monomorphism, it must be its own image; thus, not only are abelian categories normal, so that every monomorphism is a kernel, but we also know &quot;which&quot; morphism the monomorphism is a kernel of, to wit, its cokernel.
In symbols:
:&quot;m&quot; = ker (coker &quot;m&quot;) (for monomorphisms in an abelian category)

==Relationship to algebraic kernels==
Universal algebra defines a notion of kernel for homomorphisms between two algebraic structures of the same kind.
This concept of kernel measures how far the given homomorphism is from being injective.
There is some overlap between this algebraic notion and the categorical notion of kernel since both generalize the situation of groups and modules mentioned above.
In general, however, the universal-algebraic notion of kernel is more like the category-theoretic concept of kernel pair.
In particular, kernel pairs can be used to interpret kernels in monoid theory or ring theory in category-theoretic terms.

<doc id="142622" wikidata="Q5379515" url="?curid=142622" title="Enriched category">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, an enriched category generalizes the idea of a category by replacing hom-sets with objects from a general monoidal category. It is motivated by the observation that, in many practical applications, the hom-set often has additional structure that should be respected, e.g., that of being a vector space of morphisms, or a topological space of morphisms. In an enriched category, the set of morphisms (the hom-set) associated with every pair of objects is replaced by an object in some fixed monoidal category of &quot;hom-objects&quot;. In order to emulate the (associative) composition of morphisms in an ordinary category, the hom-category must have a means of composing hom-objects in an associative manner: that is, there must be a binary operation on objects giving us at least the structure of a monoidal category, though in some contexts the operation may also need to be commutative and perhaps also to have a right adjoint (i.e., making the category symmetric monoidal or even symmetric closed monoidal, respectively).

Enriched category theory thus encompasses within the same framework a wide variety of structures including
* ordinary categories where the hom-set carries additional structure beyond being a set. That is, there are operations on, or properties of morphisms that need to be respected by composition (e.g., the existence of 2-cells between morphisms and horizontal composition thereof in a 2-category, or the addition operation on morphisms in an abelian category)
* category-like entities that don&#x27;t themselves have any notion of individual morphism but whose hom-objects have similar compositional aspects (e.g., preorders where the composition rule ensures transitivity, or Lawvere&#x27;s metric spaces, where the hom-objects are numerical distances and the composition rule provides the triangle inequality).

In the case where the hom-object category happens to be the category of sets with the usual cartesian product, the definitions of enriched category, enriched functor, etc... reduce to the original definitions from ordinary category theory.

An enriched category with hom-objects from monoidal category M is said to be an enriched category over M or an enriched category in M, or simply an M-category. Due to Mac Lane&#x27;s preference for the letter V in referring to the monoidal category, enriched categories are also sometimes referred to generally as V-categories.

==Definition==
Let be a monoidal category. Then an &quot;enriched category&quot; C (alternatively, in situations where the choice of monoidal category needs to be explicit, a &quot;category enriched over&quot; M, or M-&quot;category&quot;), consists of
* a class &quot;ob&quot;(C) of &quot;objects&quot; of C,
* an object of M for every pair of objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in C, used to define an arrow formula_1 in C as an arrow formula_2 in M,
* an arrow in M designating an &quot;identity&quot; for every object &quot;a&quot; in C, and
* an arrow in M designating a &quot;composition&quot; for each triple of objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in C, used to define the composition of formula_3 and formula_4 in C as formula_5 together with three commuting diagrams, discussed below.

The first diagram expresses the associativity of composition:

That is, the associativity requirement is now taken over by the associator of the monoidal category M.

For the case that M is the category of sets and is the monoidal structure given by the cartesian product, the terminal single-point set, and the canonical isomorphisms they induce, then each is a set whose elements may be thought of as &quot;individual morphisms&quot; of C, while °, now a function, defines how consecutive morphisms compose. In this case, each path leading to in the first diagram corresponds to one of the two ways of composing three consecutive individual morphisms , i.e. elements from , and . Commutativity of the diagram is then merely the statement that both orders of composition give the same result, exactly as required for ordinary categories.

What is new here is that the above expresses the requirement for associativity without any explicit reference to individual morphisms in the enriched category C — again, these diagrams are for morphisms in monoidal category M, and not in C — thus making the concept of associativity of composition meaningful in the general case where the hom-objects are abstract, and C itself need not even &quot;have&quot; any notion of individual morphism.

The notion that an ordinary category must have identity morphisms is replaced by the second and third diagrams, which express identity in terms of left and right unitors:
and

Returning to the case where M is the category of sets with cartesian product, the morphisms become functions from the one-point set &quot;I&quot; and must then, for any given object &quot;a&quot;, identify a particular element of each set , something we can then think of as the &quot;identity morphism for &quot;a&quot; in C&quot;. Commutativity of the latter two diagrams is then the statement that compositions (as defined by the functions °) involving these distinguished individual &quot;identity morphisms in C&quot; behave exactly as per the identity rules for ordinary categories.

Note that there are several distinct notions of &quot;identity&quot; being referenced here:
* the &quot;monoidal identity object&quot; of M, being an identity for ⊗ only in the monoid-theoretic sense, and even then only up to canonical isomorphism .
* the &quot;identity morphism&quot; that M has for each of its objects by virtue of it being (at least) an ordinary category.
* the &quot;enriched category identity&quot; for each object &quot;a&quot; in C, which is again a morphism of M which, even in the case where C &quot;is&quot; deemed to have individual morphisms of its own, is not necessarily identifying a specific one.

==Examples of enriched categories==

* Ordinary categories are categories enriched over (Set, ×, {•}), the category of sets with Cartesian product as the monoidal operation, as noted above.
* 2-Categories are categories enriched over Cat, the category of small categories, with monoidal structure being given by cartesian product. In this case the 2-cells between morphisms &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; and the vertical-composition rule that relates them correspond to the morphisms of the ordinary category &quot;C&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and its own composition rule.
* Locally small categories are categories enriched over (SmSet, ×), the category of small sets with Cartesian product as the monoidal operation. (A locally small category is one whose hom-objects are small sets.)
* Locally finite categories, by analogy, are categories enriched over (FinSet, ×), the category of finite sets with Cartesian product as the monoidal operation.
* If &quot;C&quot; is a closed monoidal category then &quot;C&quot; is enriched in itself.
* Preordered sets are categories enriched over a certain monoidal category, 2, consisting of two objects and a single nonidentity arrow between them that we can write as &quot;FALSE&quot; → &quot;TRUE&quot;, conjunction as the monoid operation, and &quot;TRUE&quot; as its monoidal identity. The hom-objects 2(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) then simply deny or affirm a particular binary relation on the given pair of objects (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); for the sake of having more familiar notation we can write this relation as . The existence of the compositions and identity required for a category enriched over 2 immediately translate to the following axioms respectively
::&quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; and &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; ⇒ &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; (transitivity)
::&quot;TRUE&quot; ⇒ &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; (reflexivity)
:which are none other than the axioms for ≤ being a preorder. And since all diagrams in 2 commute, this is the &quot;sole&quot; content of the enriched category axioms for categories enriched over 2.
* William Lawvere&#x27;s generalized metric spaces, also known as pseudoquasimetric spaces, are categories enriched over the nonnegative extended real numbers , where the latter is given ordinary category structure via the inverse of its usual ordering (i.e., there exists a morphism &quot;r&quot; → &quot;s&quot; iff &quot;r&quot; ≥ &quot;s&quot;) and a monoidal structure via addition (+) and zero (0). The hom-objects are essentially distances d(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), and the existence of composition and identity translate to
::d(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) + d(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) ≥ d(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) (triangle inequality)
::0 ≥ d(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) 
* Categories with zero morphisms are categories enriched over (Set*, ∧), the category of pointed sets with smash product as the monoidal operation; the special point of a hom-object Hom(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) corresponds to the zero morphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;.
* The category Ab of abelian groups and the category R-Mod of modules over a commutative ring, and the category Vect of vector spaces over a given field are enriched over themselves, where the morphisms inherit the algebraic structure &quot;pointwise&quot;. More generally, preadditive categories are categories enriched over (Ab, ⊗) with tensor product as the monoidal operation (thinking of abelian groups as Z-modules).

==Relationship with monoidal functors==
If there is a monoidal functor from a monoidal category M to a monoidal category N, then any category enriched over M can be reinterpreted as a category enriched over N. Every monoidal category M has a monoidal functor M(&quot;I&quot;, –) to the category of sets, so any enriched category has an underlying ordinary category. In many examples (such as those above) this functor is faithful, so a category enriched over M can be described as an ordinary category with certain additional structure or properties.

== Enriched functors ==

An enriched functor is the appropriate generalization of the notion of a functor to enriched categories. Enriched functors are then maps between enriched categories which respect the enriched structure.

If &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are M-categories (that is, categories enriched over monoidal category M), an M-enriched functor&quot; or M-functor&quot; &quot;T&quot;: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is a map which assigns to each object of &quot;C&quot; an object of &quot;D&quot; and for each pair of objects &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;C&quot; provides a morphism in M &quot;Tab&quot; : &quot;C&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) → &quot;D&quot;(&quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;), &quot;T&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) between the hom-objects of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; (which are objects in M), satisfying enriched versions of the axioms of a functor, viz preservation of identity and composition.

Because the hom-objects need not be sets in an enriched category, one cannot speak of a particular morphism. There is no longer any notion of an identity morphism, nor of a particular composition of two morphisms. Instead, morphisms from the unit to a hom-object should be thought of as selecting an identity, and morphisms from the monoidal product should be thought of as composition. The usual functorial axioms are replaced with corresponding commutative diagrams involving these morphisms.

In detail, one has that the diagram

commutes, which amounts to the equation
:formula_6
where &quot;I&quot; is the unit object of M. This is analogous to the rule &quot;F&quot;(id&quot;a&quot;) = id&quot;F&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) for ordinary functors. Additionally, one demands that the diagram 

commute, which is analogous to the rule &quot;F&quot;(&quot;fg&quot;)=&quot;F&quot;(&quot;f&quot;)&quot;F&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) for ordinary functors.

There is also a notion of enriched natural transformations between enriched functors, and the relationship between M-categories, M-functors, and M-natural transformations mirrors that in ordinary category theory: there is a 2-category M-cat whose objects are M-categories, (1-)morphisms are M-functors between them, and 2-morphisms are M-natural transformations between those.

<text>Boeing Boeing is a 1965 American bedroom farce comedy film based on the 1960 French play &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot; and starring Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis. Released on December 22, 1965, it was the last film that Lewis made for Paramount Pictures, which had produced all of his films since &quot;My Friend Irma&quot; (1949).

==Plot==
Bernard Lawrence is an American journalist stationed in Paris. A playboy, he has devised an ingenious system for juggling three girlfriends: he dates flight attendants who are assigned to international routes on non-intersecting flight schedules so that only one is in the country at any given time. He has their routes detailed with such precision that he can drop off his British United Airways girlfriend for her outgoing flight and pick up his inbound Lufthansa girlfriend on the same trip to the airport, while his Air France girlfriend is in a holding pattern elsewhere.

With help from his long-suffering housekeeper Bertha, who swaps the appropriate photos and food in and out of the apartment to match the incoming girlfriend, Lawrence keeps the women unaware of each other&#x27;s presence in the apartment. They regard Lawrence&#x27;s flat as their &quot;home&quot; during their Paris layovers.

Bernard is so happy with his life in Paris that he intends to turn down an imminent promotion that would require him to move to New York City. But his life is turned upside down when his girlfriends&#x27; airlines begin putting new, state-of-the-art jet aircraft into service. These faster airplanes change all of the existing route schedules and allow flight attendants to spend more time in Paris. Most alarming for Bernard, his three girlfriends will now all be in Paris at the same time.

Robert Reed, a fellow journalist and an old acquaintance, complicates Bernard&#x27;s life even further when he arrives in town and is unable to find a hotel room. He insists on staying in Bernard&#x27;s apartment for a few days. When he sees Bernard&#x27;s living situation, he schemes to take over Bernard&#x27;s apartment, girls, housekeeper and job while manipulating Bernard into taking the new job in New York.

==Cast==
* Tony Curtis: Bernard Lawrence
* Jerry Lewis: Robert Reed
* Dany Saval: Jacqueline Grieux (Air France stewardess)
* Christiane Schmidtmer: Lise Bruner (Lufthansa stewardess)
* Suzanna Leigh: Vicky Hawkins (British United stewardess)
* Thelma Ritter: Bertha
* Lomax Study: Pierre

==Production==
Director John Rich was under contract to Hal Wallis who assigned him to the film. The director saw the play in London and &quot;realized at once that it was a giant European hit because its driving issue was satirically poking fun at American sexual proclivities in the jet age. I felt that a film based on this theme would do extremely well in foreign markets but probably wouldn’t be received happily by U.S. audiences. Wallis disagreed with my comments.&quot;

According to Rich, Wallis insisted on casting Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis in the leads. Rich liked Curtis but would have preferred Jack Lemmon or Dick Van Dyke instead of Lewis, who he felt would fall &quot;back on familiary schtick rather than aiming for honesty.&quot;

&quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; was filmed from April 8 to June 30, 1965. Rich says initially Lewis misbehaved but the director threatened him and they forged a capable working relationship after that.

As Curtis and Lewis both wanted top billing, their names at the beginning of the film spin around in a circle with an airplane nacelle behind them. For the film&#x27;s trailer, the animation was repeated and neither name was spoken aloud. On the film&#x27;s posters, the names made an &quot;X&quot;, with Lewis&#x27; name going up from the bottom left and Curtis&#x27; name going down from the upper left.

The film is one of the first times where audiences were able to hear Lewis speak with his normal voice throughout. It was a departure from the clownish style of visual comedy his fans had become accustomed to.

== Reception ==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Howard Thompson called the film a &quot;strictly one-gag frolic&quot; and &quot;just middling, passable nonsense.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on February 14, 2012.

==Legacy==
The film was selected by Quentin Tarantino for the first Quentin Tarantino Film Fest in Austin, Texas in 1996.

It was remade in Malayalam in 1985 with the same title. There are also numerous other adaptations of the same 1960 French play which inspired this film.

&quot;Garam Masala&quot; is a 2005 remake of Priyadarshan&#x27;s 1985 Malayalam comedy.

<text>Rank Xerox Limited was formed in 1956 as a joint venture between the Xerox Corporation of United States (a.k.a. Haloid Photographic) and The Rank Organisation of the United Kingdom, to manufacture and market Xerox equipment initially in Europe and later in Africa and Asia. A further joint venture between Rank Xerox and Modi Group in India formed Modi Xerox (now Xerox India) to manufacture and sell Xerox equipment in the Indian subcontinent.

The initial joint venture was 50% Xerox and 50% Rank Organisation, but this changed after a few years to a 60/40 split. Later, Xerox bought a further share making the split 80/20, and in the late 1990s, completed the purchase, so Rank Xerox Limited formally became Xerox Limited. The Rank Xerox Research Centre was renamed to the Xerox Research Centre Europe. The laboratory, based in France, was acquired by South Korean IT company Naver Corporation in 2017, and later became Naver Labs Europe.

==History==
In 1956, The Rank Organisation was looking for a product to sit alongside a small business it had making camera lenses. Thomas Law, who was the head of the business, found his answer in a scientific magazine he picked up by chance. He read about an invention that could produce copies of documents as good as the original. Law tracked down the backers, an obscure photographic-supply company in Rochester, New York, named Haloid.

Haloid and Rank subsequently formed an affiliate called Rank Xerox (Rank put up £600,000 for a 50% stake in Rank Xerox). This arrangement paved the way for Xerox factories in Great Britain and a sales and distribution system that brought Xerox machines to the European market. As photocopying took the world by storm, so did Rank&#x27;s profits. According to Graham Dowson, later Rank&#x27;s chief executive, it was &quot;a stroke of luck that turned out to be a touch of genius … If Tom Law had not seen that magazine, we would not have known about xerography – or at least not before it was too late.&quot; In 1962, Rank Xerox also formed a joint marketing and manufacturing facility in Japan with The Fuji Photo Film Company and named Fuji Xerox (now Fujifilm Business Innovation).

In a speech in 1968, Rank Xerox managing director Nigel Foulkes said that in 1961 the company had had &quot;a five-years&#x27; lead over the rest of the world&quot;, with copying products which had no serious competition. But &quot;you cannot strike oil and not expect other prospectors to sink wells&quot;.

In 1968, Rank Xerox, under Foulkes, initiated a marketing concept to sell rather than rent their copying machines behind the Iron Curtain, by appointing Gordon S Planner as General Manager East Export Operations via a firm of head hunters. Sales of machines increased rapidly to Eastern Europe and a unique marketing concept deployed in 1973 using a specially built and equipped train showcasing Rank Xerox copiers, it toured nine countries in Eastern Europe covering 30,000 miles and returned orders of over £3m. Commissioning London based designer Cairnes Maltby, the latter came up firstly with a train unit comprising five carriages. These contained staff accommodations, a kitchen, overnight staff sleeping cabins and a demonstration salon and bar. Pulled by engines of the various countries of the Soviet Bloc, the train reached Russia and a welcome market. The following year Cairnes Design Associates produced the first of the Rank Xerox Showliners. A large, articulated, semi-trailer truck with motorised pull-outs, this allowed the road-legal trailer to extend to a fully functional showroom, complete with large picture windows and small kitchen. Unlike the train it was capable of reaching the small to medium size cities of the Soviet Bloc. Both train and truck avoided the problems that affected western firms trying to establish a presence in the East.

Later, in the UK, the mobile exhibition concept was taken to its ultimate conclusion. Following several truck based Showliners, a train and a converted bus, a huge mobile exhibition was conceived. This moved from town to town, like a circus, using sports halls and exhibition centres to present a vast, virtual, office of the future. Ralph Land CBE, was General Manager of Rank Xerox Eastern Europe Operations (1976–91).

During the 1980s the managing director Roland E. Magnin helped the company to become the international arm of Xerox Corporation. He then moved to the corporation&#x27;s headquarters in Connecticut where he was responsible for the decentralization program of the company as one of its top directors.

The remaining 20% stake owned by the Rank Organization in Rank Xerox Limited was bought out by the parent Xerox Corporation for £940 million in 1997; the company was renamed Xerox Limited soon after. The Rank Xerox name was discontinued following the buyout in favour of Xerox, and the Rank Xerox Research Centre was renamed to the Xerox Research Centre Europe. The laboratory, based in France, was acquired by South Korean IT company Naver Corporation in 2017, and later became Naver Labs Europe.

<text>In category theory and its applications to mathematics, a normal monomorphism or conormal epimorphism is a particularly well-behaved type of morphism.
A normal category is a category in which every monomorphism is normal. A conormal category is one in which every epimorphism is conormal.

==Definition==
A monomorphism is normal if it is the kernel of some morphism, and an epimorphism is conormal if it is the cokernel of some morphism.

A category C is binormal if it&#x27;s both normal and conormal.
But note that some authors will use the word &quot;normal&quot; only to indicate that C is binormal.

==Examples==
In the category of groups, a monomorphism &quot;f&quot; from &quot;H&quot; to &quot;G&quot; is normal if and only if its image is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. In particular, if &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then the inclusion map &quot;i&quot; from &quot;H&quot; to &quot;G&quot; is a monomorphism, and will be normal if and only if &quot;H&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. In fact, this is the origin of the term &quot;normal&quot; for monomorphisms.

On the other hand, every epimorphism in the category of groups is conormal (since it is the cokernel of its own kernel), so this category is conormal.

In an abelian category, every monomorphism is the kernel of its cokernel, and every epimorphism is the cokernel of its kernel.
Thus, abelian categories are always binormal.
The category of abelian groups is the fundamental example of an abelian category, and accordingly every subgroup of an abelian group is a normal subgroup.

<doc id="142649" wikidata="Q312564" url="?curid=142649" title="Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig">
<text>Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig (; 19 June 1861 – 29 January 1928), was a senior officer of the British Army. During the First World War he commanded the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front from late 1915 until the end of the war.

His military career included service in the War Office, where he was instrumental in the creation of the Territorial Force in 1908. In January 1917 he was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal, subsequently leading the BEF during the final Hundred Days Offensive. This campaign, in combination with the Kiel mutiny, the Wilhelmshaven mutiny, the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and civil unrest across Germany, led to the armistice of 11 November 1918. It is considered by some historians to be one of the greatest victories ever achieved by a British-led army.

He gained a favourable reputation during the immediate post-war years, with his funeral a day of national mourning. However he also had some prominent contemporary detractors and, beginning in the 1960s, has been widely criticised for his wartime leadership. He was nicknamed &quot;Butcher Haig&quot; for the two million British casualties under his command. The Canadian War Museum comments: &quot;His epic but costly offensives at the Somme (1916) and Passchendaele (1917) have become nearly synonymous with the carnage and futility of First World War battles.&quot; Since the 1980s many historians have argued that the public hatred of Haig failed to recognise the adoption of new tactics and technologies by forces under his command, the important role played by British forces in the allied victory of 1918, and that high casualties were a consequence of the tactical and strategic realities of the time.

==Early life==

Haig was born in a house on Charlotte Square, Edinburgh. His father, John Richard Haig, an alcoholic, was head of the family&#x27;s successful Haig &amp; Haig whisky distillery; he had an income of £10,000 per year (£1,160,000 in 2018), an enormous amount at the time. His mother, Rachel (daughter of Hugh Veitch of Stewartfield), was from an impoverished gentry family. The family home was Haig House in Windygates, Fife.

Haig&#x27;s education began in 1869 as a boarder at Mr Bateson&#x27;s School in St Andrews. Later in 1869, he switched to Edinburgh Collegiate School, and then in 1871 to Orwell House, a preparatory school in Warwickshire. He then attended Clifton College. Both of Haig&#x27;s parents had died by the time he was eighteen.

After a tour of the United States with his brother, Haig studied Political Economy, Ancient History and French Literature at Brasenose College, Oxford, 1880–1883. He devoted much of his time to socialising – he was a member of the Bullingdon Club – and equestrian sports. He was one of the best young horsemen at Oxford and part of the University polo team. While an undergraduate he was initiated as a Freemason in Elgin&#x27;s Lodge at Leven, Fife, taking the first and second degrees of Freemasonry. In 1920 the Earl of Eglinton encouraged Haig to complete his Masonic progression, and he returned to his lodge to take the third degree, serving as Worshipful Master of the lodge from 1925 to 1926. He became an officer of the Grand Lodge of Scotland.

Although he passed his final exam at Oxford (a requirement for university applicants to Sandhurst), he was not eligible for a degree as he had missed a term&#x27;s residence owing to illness, and if he had stayed for longer he would have been above the age limit (23) to begin officer training at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which he entered in January 1884. Because he had been to university, Haig was considerably older than most of his class at Sandhurst. He was Senior Under-Officer, was awarded the Anson Sword and passed out first in the order of merit. He was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 7th (Queen&#x27;s Own) Hussars on 7 February 1885.
==Career==

===Junior officer===
Early in his military career, Haig played polo for England on a tour of the United States (August 1886). He would remain a polo enthusiast all his life, serving as Chairman of the Hurlingham Polo Committee from 1914 until 1922, President of the Army Polo Committee, and founder of the Indian Polo Association.

Haig saw overseas service in India (sent out November 1886), where he was appointed the regiment&#x27;s adjutant in 1888. He was something of a disciplinarian, but impressed his superiors by his administrative skill and analysis of training exercises. He was promoted to captain on 23 January 1891.

Haig left India in November 1892 to prepare for the entrance exam for the Staff College, Camberley, which he sat in June 1893. Although he was placed in the top 28 (the number of places awarded by exam) he was not awarded a place as he had narrowly failed the compulsory mathematics paper. He concealed this failure for the rest of his life and in 1910 recommended dropping the mathematics paper as a requirement. Adjutant-General Sir Redvers Buller refused to award Haig one of the four nominated places, citing his colour blindness, despite Haig having his eyesight rechecked by a German oculist and despite glowing testimonials. It has been postulated that Buller was looking for a rationale to give a place to an infantry officer.

Haig returned briefly to India as second-in-command of the squadron which he had himself commanded in 1892, then returned to the UK as Aide-de-camp to Sir Keith Fraser, Inspector General of Cavalry. Fraser was one of those who had lobbied for Haig to enter the Staff College, and he was finally nominated in late 1894, a common practice in the day for promising candidates. While waiting to take up his place, he travelled to Germany to report on cavalry manoeuvres there, and served as staff officer to Colonel John French on manoeuvres. The careers of French and Haig were to be entwined for the next twenty-five years, and Haig helped French write the cavalry drillbook, published 1896.

Haig entered Staff College, Camberley in 1896, where he was apparently not popular with his peers. For example, they chose Allenby as Master of the Drag Hunt, despite Haig being the better rider. Haig impressed the Chief Instructor, Lt-Col G. F. R. Henderson, and completed the course, leaving in 1897. Camberley&#x27;s old-fashioned curriculum especially influenced Haig, as he was an absorber of doctrine rather than an original thinker. Haig was taught that victory must come from defeating the main enemy army in battle, and that attrition (the &quot;wearing out fight&quot;) was merely a prelude to the commitment of reserves for a decisive battlefield victory; traces of this thought can be seen at Loos and the Somme. Great emphasis was placed on morale and mobility, and on Murat&#x27;s cavalry pursuit after Napoleon&#x27;s Jena campaign of 1806.

===Mahdist War, 1898===
In early January Haig was picked by Evelyn Wood (by then Adjutant-General) as one of three recent staff college graduates requested by Kitchener for a campaign in the Mahdist War in the Sudan. He may have been picked to keep an eye on Kitchener, as Wood invited him to write to him in confidence. Haig needed little encouragement to (privately) criticise his superiors – he was especially critical of Kitchener&#x27;s dictatorial habits. Kitchener&#x27;s force was Anglo-Egyptian, and Haig was required to formally join the Egyptian Army, most of whose officers were British. The plan had been for him to train and take command of an Egyptian cavalry squadron, but Kitchener did not want a command reshuffle with combat imminent. Unlike many British officers, Haig believed that the Egyptians could make good soldiers if properly trained and led. Still without a formal position but accompanying the cavalry, Haig saw his first action in a skirmish south of Atbara (21 March). In his report to Wood about the skirmish, Haig commented on the lack of British machine guns. While later criticized for his failure to optimize the use of machine guns, Haig made a special trip to Enfield to study the Maxim Gun, and throughout the campaign commented on its worth.

Four days later he was made staff officer of Broadwood&#x27;s cavalry brigade. Haig distinguished himself at his second action, the Battle of Nukheila (6 April), where he supervised the redeployment of squadrons to protect the rear and then launch a flank attack. He was present at the Battle of Atbara (8 April), after which he criticised Kitchener for launching a frontal attack without taking the Dervishes in flank. During the latter action Haig risked his life rescuing a wounded Egyptian soldier under enemy fire, an act which moved several officers present to believe Haig should receive the Victoria Cross. After Atbara, Kitchener was given reinforcements and Haig received a squadron of his own, which he commanded at Omdurman (in reserve during the battle, then on a flank march into the town afterwards). He was promoted to brevet major on 15 November 1898.

===Second Boer War, 1899–1902===
Haig returned to the United Kingdom hoping for a position at the War Office, but was instead appointed (May 1899) brigade major to the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot.

Haig had recently lent £2,500 (in a formal contract with interest, worth £400,000 in 2024) to the brigade commander, John French, to cover his losses from South African mining speculations. The loan allowed French to maintain his commission. Haig was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 26 June 1899.

Haig was soon appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (September 1899) and then Assistant Adjutant General (i.e. chief staff officer) of French&#x27;s brigade-sized force as it was sent to the Boer War. He took part in French&#x27;s first battle, Elandslaagte (21 October). French and Haig were ordered to leave Ladysmith as the four-month siege began, to take charge of the new Cavalry Division arriving from the UK. The two men escaped on the last train to leave Ladysmith (2 November 1899), lying down as it passed through enemy fire.

Haig continued to be sceptical of the importance of artillery, basing his opinions on interviews with enemy prisoners. After French&#x27;s Colesberg Operations to protect Cape Colony, Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief, appointed his protégé Colonel the Earl of Erroll, over French&#x27;s protests, to the job of Assistant Adjutant General of the Cavalry Division, with Haig, who had been promised the job (and the local rank of lieutenant-colonel), as his deputy. Cavalry played a leading role in this stage of the war, including the relief of Kimberley (15 February 1900), which featured a spectacular British cavalry charge at Klip Drift. Haig was briefly (21 February 1900) given command of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, then made AAG to the Cavalry Division after Erroll was moved to a different job. French&#x27;s Division took part in the capture of Bloemfontein (13 March 1900) and Pretoria (5 June 1900). Haig privately criticised Roberts and thought him a &quot;silly old man&quot;.

After Roberts had won the conventional war, Kitchener was left in charge of fighting the Boers, who had taken to guerrilla warfare. The Cavalry Division was disbanded (November 1900) and French, with Haig still his chief of staff, was put in charge of an all-arms force policing the Johannesburg area, later trying to capture the Boer leader de Wet around Bloemfontein. In January 1901 Haig was given a column of 2,500 men with the local rank of brigadier-general, patrolling Cape Colony, and chasing Commandant Kritzinger. As was standard policy at that time, Haig&#x27;s actions included burning farmsteads as part of the scorched earth policies ordered by Lord Kitchener as well as rounding up Boer women and children to be placed in concentration camps.

Throughout the war Haig&#x27;s sister, Henrietta, had been lobbying Evelyn Wood for her brother to have command of a cavalry regiment when the war was over. French, probably not wanting to part with a valuable assistant, recommended Herbert Lawrence for the vacant command of the 17th Lancers, but Roberts, now Commander-in-Chief back in Britain, overruled him and gave it to Haig (May 1901). As the 17th Lancers were in South Africa at the time Haig was able to combine that command with that of his own column.

As the war drew to a close Haig had to locate and escort the Boer leader Jan Christiaan Smuts to the peace negotiations at Vereeninging. Haig was mentioned in despatches four times for his service in South Africa (including by Lord Roberts on 31 March 1900, and by Lord Kitchener on 23 June 1902), and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1900. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 17 July 1901.

Following the war, Haig left Cape Town with 540 officers and men of the 17th Lancers on the SS &quot;German&quot; in late September 1902. The regiment was supposed to stay in South Africa but in the end returned home sooner than planned, and arrived at Southampton in late October, when they were posted to Edinburgh. Haig was appointed an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII in the October 1902 South Africa Honours list, with the brevet rank of colonel.

===Inspector general of Cavalry, India===
Haig continued as the commanding officer of the 17th Lancers until 1903, stationed in Edinburgh. In October he was then appointed inspector general of cavalry in British India, for which he was promoted to substantive colonel whilst holding the local rank of major general while in his new assignment. He would have preferred command of the cavalry brigade at Aldershot, where French was now General Officer Commanding, but had first to spend a year on garrison duty at Edinburgh until the previous incumbent completed his term.

Haig&#x27;s war service had earned him belated but rapid promotion: having been a captain until the relatively advanced age of thirty-seven, by 1904 he had become the youngest major-general in the British Army at that time. He was present at the Rawalpindi Parade 1905 to honour the Prince and Princess of Wales&#x27; visit to India. At this time a great deal of the energies of the most senior British generals were taken up with the question of whether cavalry should still be trained to charge with sword and lance (the view of French and Haig). Lord Roberts, now Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, warned Kitchener (now Commander-in-Chief, India) to be &quot;very firm with Haig&quot; on this issue, and wrote that Haig was a &quot;clever, able fellow&quot; who had great influence over Sir John French.

===Marriage and children===
On leave from India, Haig married Dorothy Maud Vivian on 11 July 1905 after a whirlwind courtship (she had spotted him for the first time when he was playing polo at Hurlingham two years earlier). She was a daughter of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian and Louisa Duff.

The couple had four children:
* Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Haig (9 March 1907 – 1997); First married to Rear-Admiral Clarence Dinsmore Howard-Johnston, with whom she had three children: James Howard-Johnston, Xenia, and Peter. She secondly married in 1954 historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was later created Baron Dacre of Glanton.
* Lady Victoria Doris Rachel Haig (7 November 1908 – 1993). Married Colonel Claud Andrew Montagu Douglas Scott on 10 August 1929, with whom she had two children (divorced 1951)
*George Alexander Eugene Douglas Haig, 2nd Earl Haig (15 March 1918 – 10 July 2009)
*Lady Irene Violet Freesia Janet Augusta Haig (7 October 1919 – 2001); wife of Gavin Astor, 2nd Baron Astor of Hever

Haig had used his leave in 1905 to lobby for a job at the War Office, but the proposal was rejected by H. O. Arnold-Forster the Secretary of State for War as too blatantly relying on royal influence.

===War Office===
The Boer War had exposed Britain&#x27;s lack of a general staff and modern reserve army. In August 1906 Haig was appointed Director of Military Training at the War Office. Haldane later wrote that Haig had &quot;a first rate general staff mind&quot; and &quot;gave invaluable advice&quot;. Although both men later claimed that the reforms had been to prepare Britain for continental war, they created a small professional army within a budget, with conscription politically impossible.

The reforms reorganised the militia, yeomanry and volunteers into the new Territorial Force. Haig was intolerant of what he regarded as old-fashioned opinions and not good at negotiating with strangers. Haig had wanted a reserve of 900,000 men, but Haldane settled for a more realistic 300,000. Haig&#x27;s skills at administration and organising training and inspections were better employed in setting up an Expeditionary Force of 120,000 men in 1907. As an intimate of Haldane Haig was able to ensure high priority for cavalry, less for artillery, contrary to the advice of Lord Roberts (now retired). Haig&#x27;s records of his time supervising artillery exercises show little interest in technical matters.

In November 1907 Haig was moved sideways to Director of Staff Duties. He required commanders to take the staff officers assigned to them (rather than choose their own by patronage) and assigned staff officers to the new Territorial Army. He supervised publication of &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;, which was later very useful in expanding the BEF, although it still stressed the importance of cavalry charging with sword and lance. At this time he was completing a separate work, &quot;Cavalry Studies&quot;, and devoting much time to cavalry exercises.

===Chief of Staff, India===
By 1909 it seemed likely that an Anglo-German War loomed and Haig was reluctant to accept appointment as Chief of the General Staff in India. He passed the Director of Staff Duties job to his loyal follower Brigadier-General Kiggell, to whom he wrote with &quot;advice&quot; every fortnight. Haig, who had been knighted for his work at the War Office, was promoted to lieutenant-general in November 1910. In India he had hoped to develop the Indian General Staff and to organise despatch of the British Indian Army to a future European war. The latter was vetoed by Viceroy Lord Hardinge. An Indian Corps would serve on the Western Front early in the conflict, and Indian troops were used in comparatively small formations in the Middle East.

===Aldershot===
Haig left India in December 1911, and took up an appointment as GOC Aldershot Command (1st and 2nd divisions and 1st Cavalry Brigade) in March 1912.

In the Army Manoeuvres of 1912 he was decisively beaten by Lieutenant General Sir James Grierson despite having the odds in his favour, because of Grierson&#x27;s superior use of air reconnaissance. At dinner afterwards Haig abandoned his prepared text, and although he wrote that his remarks were &quot;well received&quot;, John Charteris recorded that they were &quot;unintelligible and unbearably dull&quot; and that the visiting dignitaries fell asleep. Haig&#x27;s poor public speaking skills aside, the manoeuvres were thought to have shown the reformed army efficient. In June 1913 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1913 Birthday Honours.

==First World War==

===1914===

====Outbreak of war====
During the Curragh Mutiny (March 1914) Haig urged caution on his chief of staff John Gough, whose brother Hubert Gough was threatening to resign rather than coerce Ulstermen into a semi-independent Ireland. Haig stressed that the army&#x27;s duty was to keep the peace. Sir John French was forced to resign as CIGS, after putting in writing a promise that officers would not be required to coerce Ulster; Haig respected Hubert Gough&#x27;s principled stand but felt French had allowed himself to be used as a political tool by H. H. Asquith.

Upon the outbreak of war in August 1914, Haig helped organize the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French. As planned, Haig&#x27;s Aldershot command was formed into I Corps. In a letter to Haldane (4 August), Haig predicted that the war would last for months if not years; Haig wanted Haldane to delay sending the BEF to France until the Territorial Army had been mobilised and incorporated. Haig attended the War Council (5 August), at which it was decided that it was too dangerous to mobilise forward in France at Maubeuge near the Belgian border, as British mobilisation was running three days behind that of France and Germany. There were no other contingency plans – Haig and Kitchener proposed that the BEF would be better positioned to counter-attack in Amiens. Sir John French suggested landing at Antwerp, which was vetoed by Winston Churchill as the Royal Navy could not guarantee safe passage. A critical biographer writes that Haig was &quot;more clear-sighted than many of his colleagues&quot;.

In his much-criticised memoirs &quot;1914&quot;, French claimed that Haig had wanted to postpone sending the BEF, which may be partly true given what Haig had written to Haldane. Haig was so angry at this claim that he asked Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey to correct French&#x27;s &quot;inaccuracies&quot;. However Haig also rewrote his diary from this period, possibly to show himself in a better light and French in a poor one. The original manuscript diary does not survive but there is no positive evidence that it was destroyed, and it is just as likely that the extant typed version was prepared from dictation or notes now lost. Hankey&#x27;s notes of the meeting record that Haig suggested delaying or sending smaller forces, but was willing to send forces if France was in danger of defeat or if France wanted them (which it did). Haig predicted that the war would last several years and that an army of a million men, trained by officers and NCOs withdrawn from the BEF, would be needed.

Haig had been appointed &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King George V in February 1914. During a royal inspection of Aldershot (11 August), Haig told the King that he had &quot;grave doubts&quot; about French&#x27;s temper and military knowledge. He later claimed that these doubts had gone back to the Boer War but there appears to have been an element of later embellishment about this; Haig had in fact praised French during the Boer War and had welcomed his appointment as CIGS in 1911.

====Mons to the Marne====
Haig crossed over to Le Havre. The BEF landed in France on 14 August and advanced into Belgium. Haig was irritated by Sir John French, who ignored intelligence reports of German forces streaming westwards from Brussels, threatening an encirclement from the British left. Although II Corps fought off the German attack at Mons on 23 August the BEF was forced to withdraw.

The retreats of I and II Corps had to be conducted separately because of the Mormal Forest. The two corps were supposed to meet at Le Cateau but I Corps under Haig were stopped at Landrecies, leaving a large gap between the two. Haig&#x27;s reactions to his corps&#x27; skirmish with German forces at Landrecies (during which Haig led his staff into the street, revolvers drawn, promising to &quot;sell our lives dearly&quot;) caused him to send an exaggerated report to French, which caused French to panic. The following day 26 August, General Horace Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s II Corps engaged the enemy in the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig. This battle slowed the German advance. However, a critical biographer writes that too much has been made of the &quot;moment of panic&quot; at Landrecies, and that the retreat, over a period of 13 days, is a tribute to the &quot;steady and competent leadership&quot; of Haig and Smith-Dorrien.

On 25 August the French commander Joseph Joffre ordered his forces to retreat to the Marne, which compelled the BEF to further withdraw. Haig was irritated by the high-handed behaviour of the French, seizing roads which they had promised for British use and refusing to promise to cover the British right flank. He complained privately of French unreliability and lack of fighting competence, a complaint which he would keep up for the next four years. He wrote to his wife that he wished the British were operating independently from Antwerp, a proposal which he had rejected as &quot;reckless&quot; when Sir John French had made it at the War Council on 4 August.

The retreat caused Sir John French to question the competence of his Allies and led to his decision to withdraw the BEF south of the Seine. On 1 September, Lord Kitchener intervened by visiting French and ordering him to re-enter the battle and coordinate with Joffre&#x27;s forces. The battle to defend Paris began on 5 September and became known as the first Battle of the Marne. Haig had wanted to rest his corps but was happy to resume the offensive when ordered. He drove on his subordinates when he thought them lacking in &quot;fighting spirit&quot;. Although Sir John French praised Haig&#x27;s leadership of his corps, Haig was privately contemptuous of French&#x27;s overconfidence prior to Mons and excessive caution thereafter.

====First Battle of Ypres====
On 15 October, after two weeks of friction between British and French generals, Haig&#x27;s I Corps was moved to Ypres in Flanders as part of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot;. In the belief that the German northern flank was weak, Haig was ordered to march on Ghent, Bruges and Courtrai in western Belgium but the new German Chief of Staff Falkenhayn was trying to do the opposite and roll up the Allied northern flank. I Corps marched headlong into a thrust westward by fresh German forces, resulting in the First Battle of Ypres. German forces, equipped with 250 heavy guns (a large number for this stage in the war), outnumbered I Corps by two to one and came close to success. At one point Haig mounted his horse to encourage his men, who were retreating around Gheluvelt, although the town had just been recaptured by a battalion of the Worcesters. Haig cemented his reputation at this battle and Ypres remained a symbolic location in later years. Haig was also influenced by the fact that the Germans had called off their offensive when they were on the verge of success, concluding that attacks needed to be kept up so long as there was any chance of success.

After a fortnight of intense fighting I Corps had been reduced from 18,000 men to just under 3,000 effectives by 12 November. After six days of bickering between British and French generals, I Corps was relieved by French troops; Haig was very suspicious of the pro-French sympathies of Henry Wilson. French, who had been ordered by his doctor to relieve the strain on his heart, recommended Haig for immediate promotion to general. Haig travelled to London on French&#x27;s behalf to consult Kitchener about the plan to expand the BEF and reorganise it into two armies.

At this point it was thought that the war would end once the Germans were defeated by the Russians at Lodz and the difficulties of attacking on the Western Front were not yet appreciated. A failed attack by Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s II Corps on Messines–Wytschaete (14–15 December) was blamed on poor GHQ staff work, and on 18 December, Haig met French, who said he wanted to sack the BEF chief of staff Archibald Murray, whose performance had been unsatisfactory throughout the campaign and promote his deputy Henry Wilson. Haig thought that Wilson had &quot;no military knowledge&quot; and recommended Quarter-Master General &quot;Wully&quot; Robertson. This was also the view of Lord Kitchener, so Robertson received the promotion. Haig received promotion to general on 16 November 1914.

===1915===

====Spring offensives====

Like French, Haig wanted to push along the North Sea Coast to Ostend and Zeebrugge but Joffre did not want the British acting so independently. Germany had recently sent eight infantry divisions to the Eastern Front, so French and Joffre agreed that a French offensive in Artois and Champagne, should be accompanied by a British offensive at Neuve-Chapelle to be conducted by Haig. At Neuve Chapelle, Haig wanted a quick bombardment and his subordinate Henry Rawlinson a longer and more methodical one. Shortage of shells meant that only a thirty-five-minute bombardment was possible but the small front of the attack gave it the concentration to succeed.

Haig was greatly interested in the potential of aircraft and met Major Trenchard of the Royal Flying Corps to organise photographic air reconnaissance and a map of German lines was obtained; aircraft were also used for artillery spotting. Four divisions attacked at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on 10 March and penetrated but no progress was made on subsequent days, as the Germans brought in reinforcements. Casualties were around 12,000 on each side. Rawlinson had wanted to end the offensive after the first day and Haig felt that reserves should have been committed quicker. On Rawlinson&#x27;s suggestion Haig came close to sacking Major-General Joey Davies until it was found that Davies had followed Rawlinson&#x27;s orders; Haig reprimanded Rawlinson but thought him too valuable to sack. This may have made Rawlinson reluctant to stand up to Haig thereafter.

Whilst the Germans attacked Smith-Dorrien at the Second Battle of Ypres (April), new Allied offensives were planned by the French at Vimy and by Haig at Aubers Ridge (9 May). It was believed on the British side that the lessons of Neuve Chapelle had been learned – reserves were ready to exploit and mortars were ready to support attackers who had advanced beyond artillery cover – and that this time success would be complete not partial. The attack was less successful than Neuve Chapelle as the bombardment was over a wider front and against stronger defences; Haig was still focussed on winning a decisive victory by capturing key ground, rather than amassing firepower to inflict maximum damage. Attacks (at Festubert, 15–25 May) as a diversion, gained over a front of , with 16,000 British casualties to around 6,600 German losses. Sir John French was satisfied that the attacks had taken pressure off the French at their request but Haig felt that German reserves were being exhausted, bringing victory nearer.

Lack of shells at these offensives was, along with Admiral Fisher&#x27;s resignation over the failed Dardanelles Campaign, a cause of the fall of the Liberal Government (19 May). Haig did not approve of the Northcliffe press attacks on Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill (despite the fact that Kitchener was an opponent of the strong General Staff which Haig wanted to see). French had been leaking information about the shell shortage to Charles à Court Repington of &quot;The Times&quot;, whom Haig detested and which he likened to &quot;carrying on with a whore&quot;. French also communicated with Conservative leaders and to David Lloyd George who became Minister of Munitions in the new coalition government.

Haig was asked by Clive Wigram (one of the King&#x27;s press staff) to smooth relations between French and Kitchener. At Robertson&#x27;s suggestion, Haig received Kitchener at his HQ (despite French&#x27;s attempt to block the meeting), where they shared their concerns about French. The two men met again in London (14 July), whilst Haig was receiving his GCB (awarded on French&#x27;s recommendation after Neuve Chapelle) from the King, who also complained to him about French. Over lunch with the King and Kitchener, Haig remarked that the best time to sack French would have been after the retreat to the Marne; it was agreed that the men would correspond in confidence.

Haig had long thought French petty, jealous, unbalanced, overly quick to meddle in party politics and easily manipulated by Henry Wilson. Haig was increasingly irritated by French&#x27;s changes of orders and mercurial changes of mood as to the length of the war, which French now expected to last into 1916. Haig still thought Germany might collapse by November, although at the same time he was sending a memo to the War Office recommending that the BEF, now numbering 25 divisions, be equipped with the maximum number of heavy guns, ready for a huge decisive battle, 36 divisions strong in 1916.

====Loos====

The war was not going well – besides the failure at Cape Helles (landing 25 April), Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers (Serbia was soon overrun). Allied attacks in the west were needed to take pressure off the Russians, who were being flung out of Poland. The original plan was to attack in July. At Joffre&#x27;s insistence the offensive was planned next to the French Tenth Army at Loos.

Haig inspected the Loos area (24 June) and expressed dissatisfaction with the ground. French and Haig would have preferred to renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. French was dissuaded by Foch, who felt that only a British attack at Loos would pull in enough German reserves to allow the French to take Vimy Ridge. French wrote to Joffre saying he was willing to go along with these plans for the sake of Anglo-French cooperation, but then wrote to Joffre again suggesting an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks. Kitchener listened sympathetically to Joffre&#x27;s suggestion that in future Joffre should set the size, dates and objectives of British offensives, although he only agreed for the Loos attack for the moment. It is unclear exactly why Kitchener and then Haig agreed to go along with Joffre&#x27;s wishes – possibly the disastrous plight of the Russians, but it may be that a promise that poison gas could be used may have persuaded Haig. The French then postponed the attack as they picked new attacking ground in Champagne and arranged for extra shelling at Vimy, in both cases because of the very reasons – German-held villages and other obstructions – to which the British generals had objected.

Only 850 guns were available, too few for concentrated bombardment over a frontage far wider than at Neuve Chapelle. There was also argument over the placement of the reserve (including inexperienced New Army divisions), which Haig wanted close to the front. Haig had persuaded himself that decisive victory was possible, and it may be that French wanted to keep control of the reserve to stop them being thrown into battle needlessly. French tried in vain to forbid Haig to discuss his plans with Kitchener (on the grounds that Kitchener might leak them to politicians). Battle began (25 September) after Haig ordered the release of chlorine gas.

The attack failed in the north against the Hohenzollern Redoubt but broke through the German first line in the centre. The reserves were tired after night marches to reach the front in secrecy and were not available until 2 pm, but were thrown into battle without success on the second day.

====Haig replaces French====
Haig wrote a detailed letter to Kitchener claiming &quot;complete&quot; success on the first day and complaining that the reserves had not been placed as close to the front as agreed and that French had not released control of them when requested. Haig strengthened his case by reports that captured enemy officers had been astonished at the British failure to exploit the attack and by complaining about the government&#x27;s foot-dragging at introducing conscription and the commitment of troops to sideshows like Salonika and Suvla Bay.

The failure of Loos was debated in the British press. Kitchener demanded a report and Lord Haldane was sent to France to interview French and Haig. French in turn demanded a report from Haig, in particular his claim to have penetrated the German lines. Lord Stamfordham, the King&#x27;s Secretary, telephoned Robertson to ask his opinion of French and Robertson conferred with Haig – who was pushing for Robertson to be appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff – before giving his opinion. The King also discussed the matter with Haig over dinner on a visit to the front (24 October). Haig again told him that French should have been sacked in August 1914. Four days later the King, whilst inspecting troops, was injured when thrown by one of Haig&#x27;s horses and had to be evacuated to England on a stretcher, which embarrassed Haig. French had his orders releasing the reserves published in &quot;The Times&quot; (2 November), with an article by Repington blaming Haig. Haig demanded a correction of French&#x27;s &quot;inaccuracies&quot;, whereupon French ordered Haig to cease all correspondence on this matter. Haig met with the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith on 23 November and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) the next day. Rumours were rife that French was to be sacked. Matters had been delayed as Kitchener was away on an inspection tour of the Mediterranean and French was sick in bed. Kitchener returned to London (3 Dec) and at a meeting with Haig that day, told him that he was to recommend to Asquith that Haig replace French.

Haig&#x27;s appointment as Commander-in-Chief BEF was announced on 10 December and almost simultaneously Robertson became Chief of the Imperial General Staff in London. Haig and Robertson hoped that this would be the start of a new and more professional management of the war. Monro was promoted to GOC First Army in Haig&#x27;s place, not Rawlinson whom Haig would have preferred, and for reasons of seniority Haig was forced to accept the weak-willed Launcelot Kiggell, not Butler as chief of staff BEF in succession to Robertson. Haig and French, who seemed ill, had a final handover meeting (18 December, the day before the formal change of command), at which Haig agreed that Churchill – recently resigned from the Cabinet and vetoed from command of a brigade – should be given command of a battalion.

===1916===

====Prelude to the Somme====

For the first time (2 January) Haig attended church service with George Duncan, who was to have great influence over him. Haig saw himself as God&#x27;s servant and was keen to have clergymen sent out whose sermons would remind the men that the war dead were martyrs in a just cause.

Robertson and Kitchener wanted to concentrate on the Western Front, unlike many in the Cabinet who preferred Salonika or Mesopotamia. Haig and Robertson were aware that Britain would have to take on more of the offensive burden, as France was beginning to run out of men, but thought that the Germans might retreat in the west so they could concentrate on beating the Russians. Haig thought that the Germans had already had plenty of &quot;wearing out&quot;, that a decisive victory was possible in 1916 and urged Robertson to recruit more cavalry. Haig&#x27;s preference was to regain control of the Belgian coast by attacking in Flanders, to bring the coast and the naval bases at Bruges, Zeebrugge and Ostend into Allied hands and where the Germans would suffer great loss if they were reluctant to retreat.

Lloyd George visited Haig at GHQ and afterwards wrote to Haig, to say that he had been impressed by his &quot;grip&quot; and by the &quot;trained thought of a great soldier&quot;. Subsequent relations between the two men were not to be so cordial. Haig thought Lloyd George &quot;shifty and unreliable&quot;. Haig had thought that the German troops reported near Verdun were a feint prior to an attack on the British but the Verdun Offensive began on 21 February. In March 1916 GHQ was moved from Saint-Omer to Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais. For his residence Haig commandeered Beaurepaire House a few kilometres away.

Haig decided that Verdun had &quot;worn down&quot; the Germans enough and that a decisive victory was possible at once. The Cabinet were less optimistic; Kitchener would have preferred smaller, purely attritional attacks but sided with Robertson in telling the Cabinet that the Somme offensive should go ahead. Haig attended a Cabinet meeting in London (15 April) where the politicians were more concerned with the political crisis over the introduction of conscription.
The French had already insisted on an Anglo-French attack at the Somme, where British and French troops were adjacent, to relieve the pressure on the French Army at Verdun, although the French component of the attack was gradually reduced as reinforcements went to Verdun. Haig wanted to delay until 15 August, to allow for more training and more artillery to be available. When told of this Joffre shouted at Haig that &quot;the French Army would cease to exist&quot; and had to be calmed with &quot;liberal doses of 1840 brandy&quot;. The British refused to agree to French demands for a joint Anglo-French offensive from the Salonika bridgehead. Eventually, perhaps influenced by reports of French troop disturbances at Verdun, Haig agreed to attack on 29 June (later put back until 1 July). It later turned out that Pétain at Verdun was warning the French government that the &quot;game was up&quot; unless the British attacked.

The government was concerned at the volume of shipping space being used for fodder and wanted to cut the number of cavalry divisions. Haig opposed this, believing that cavalry would still be needed to exploit the imminent victory. Most of the fodder was for the horses, donkeys and mules which the BEF used to move supplies and heavy equipment. Discussing this matter with the King, Haig told him that Germany would collapse by the end of 1916. This round of planning ended with a sharp exchange of letters with the Cabinet, Haig rebuked them for interfering in military matters and declared that &quot;I am responsible for the efficiency of the Armies in France&quot;. Lloyd George thought Haig&#x27;s letter &quot;perfectly insolent&quot; and that the government &quot;had the right to investigate any matter connected with the war that they pleased&quot;.
From 1 July to 18 November 1916, Haig directed the British portion of the Battle of the Somme. Although too much shrapnel was used in the initial bombardment for 1 July, Haig was not entirely to blame for this – as early as January 1915 Haig had been impressed by evidence of the effectiveness of high explosive shells and had demanded as many of them as possible from van Donop (Head of Ordnance in Britain).

===1917===

On 1 January 1917, Haig was made a field marshal. King George V wrote him a handwritten note ending: &quot;I hope you will look upon this as a New Year&#x27;s gift from myself and the country&quot;. Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, infuriated Haig and Robertson by placing the BEF under the command of the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle. The failure of the Nivelle Offensive in April 1917 (which Haig had been required to support with a British offensive at Arras) and the subsequent French mutiny and political crisis, discredited Lloyd George&#x27;s plans for Anglo-French co-operation. During the second half of 1917, Haig conducted an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres). Haig hoped to liberate the North Sea coast of Belgium from which German U-boats were operating, provided that there was assistance from the French, support from Britain and that Russia stayed in the war.

The Admiralty, led by John Jellicoe, believed that the U-boat threat could jeopardise Britain&#x27;s ability to continue fighting. Another objective was to commit German resources to Belgian Flanders, away from the Aisne sector in France, where the French mutiny had been worst, to give the French Army time to recover. Haig was worried that the Russian Revolution would result in Russia and Germany making peace and forming an alliance. If this happened the German troops located on the Eastern Front would be transferred to the west by late 1917 or early 1918, making a decisive victory much more difficult.

The Third Battle of Ypres caused the British far fewer casualties than the Battle of the Somme and the substantial success of the occupation of the ridges around Ypres, the first stage of the offensive strategy and inflicted comparable losses on the Germans, who were far less capable of replacing losses and which contributed to their defeat in 1918.

====Cambrai====
By the end of 1917, Lloyd George felt able to assert authority over the generals and at the end of the year was able to sack the First Sea Lord Admiral Jellicoe. Over the objections of Haig and Robertson, an inter-Allied Supreme War Council was set up. When the council was inaugurated (11 November), Lloyd George attributed the success of the Central Powers to unity and scoffed at recent Allied &quot;victories&quot;, saying he wished &quot;it had not been necessary to win so many of them&quot;. His speech angered several leading politicians and Derby assured Haig of his backing. Haig and Pétain objected to a common command, arguing that coalitions work better when one power is dominant, which was no longer the case now that British military power had increased relative to that of France. Lloyd George got his wish to send British forces to Italy, after the Italian defeat at Caporetto in November. Haig knew that manpower was scarce in the BEF and at home and wrote to Robertson that an offensive at Cambrai would stem the flow of reinforcements to Italy; Robertson delayed the despatch of two divisions.

Plans for a III Corps attack at Cambrai had been proposed as far back as May. Haig had informed the War Office (5 June) that &quot;events have proved the utility of Tanks&quot;. The plan was to trap German troops between the River Sensee and Canal du Nord, with the cavalry to seize the St Quentin Canal crossings, then exploit north-east. The first day objective was the high ground around Bourlon Wood and Haig was to review progress after 48 hours.

The Third Army attacked at Cambrai early on 20 November with 1,000 guns (using a surprise predicted barrage rather than a preliminary bombardment) and nine tank battalions. On the first day the British penetrated on a front with only 4,000 casualties, limited by blown bridges and the shortness of the November day. The 51st (Highland) Division was held up at Flesquieres village, which fell the following day. Haig&#x27;s intelligence chief Brigadier-General Charteris told him that the Germans would not be able to reinforce for 48 hours and James Marshall-Cornwall, then a junior intelligence officer, later an admiring biographer of Haig, alleged that Charteris refused to have reported fresh German divisions shown on the situation map as he did not want to weaken Haig&#x27;s resolution.

Haig visited the battlefield (21 November), inspecting the fighting at Bourlon Wood through his binoculars. He thought the attacks &quot;feeble and uncoordinated&quot; and was disappointed at the lack of grip by corps and division commanders and encountering 1st Cavalry Division, which had been ordered to fall back, resisted the temptation to countermand the order. At around 9 pm he decided to continue the attack on Bourlon Wood, a decision which has been much criticised but which made good military sense at the time and was supported by Byng, although the political need for a clear victory may have been a factor. The offensive continued but with diminishing returns. Bourlon Wood fell on 23 November but German counter-attacks had begun. Haig arrived at a Third Army planning meeting (26 November) and ordered further attacks the following day but then had to bow to Byng deciding to go onto the defensive. Haig complained that the lack of extra divisions had prevented a breakthrough, a view described by one biographer as &quot;self-deception, pure and simple&quot;.

Some of the gains were retaken after 30 November, when the Germans made their first counter-offensive against the British since 1914, using new &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; tactics. GHQ intelligence had failed to piece together warnings. British casualties had mounted to over 40,000 by 3 December, with German losses somewhat less. One biographer argues that the initial success at Cambrai helped to save Haig&#x27;s job but another view is that the ultimate disappointment did more damage to Haig&#x27;s political credibility than Passchendaele. Lloyd George was particularly angry at the embarrassing Cambrai reverse, but Haig&#x27;s support amongst the Army, the public and many politicians made sacking him impossible; a plan that Haig be &quot;promoted&quot; to a sinecure, as generalissimo of British forces, was scotched when Lord Derby threatened resignation. 

Asked to provide a statement to the House of Commons, Haig attributed the German success to &quot;one cause and one alone ... lack of training on the part of junior officers and NCOs and men&quot;, a verdict supported by the court of enquiry which, at Derby&#x27;s instigation, Haig ordered, although the enquiry also criticised &quot;higher commanders&quot; for failing to enforce defensive doctrine. In a later report to Robertson Haig accepted the blame, stating that the troops had been tired as a result of the attack on Bourlon Wood. Although Haig defended Charteris, he was required to dismiss him. Robertson had arrived at Haig&#x27;s Headquarters with orders (signed by Derby) for his dismissal, in case Haig refused to do as he was asked. A common criticism is that Haig only accepted intelligence from Charteris (who told him what he wanted to hear) and did not cross-check it with other intelligence.

===1918===
====Political manoeuvres====
Over lunch at 10 Downing Street with Derby and Lloyd George in January, Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the &quot;internal state of Germany&quot;. Haig left the War Cabinet with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai. Haig recommended that the British draw in German reserves by renewing the offensive around Ypres, which did not meet with political approval. By now Haig&#x27;s 1917 offensives were being criticised in the press and in Parliament, where J.C. Wedgwood openly demanded a change of command. The purge of Haig&#x27;s staff continued, with the removal of Maxwell (Quartermaster-General) and Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell as BEF Chief of Staff.

In January the Cabinet Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts and the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey were sent to France to discreetly see whether any of the Army Commanders were willing to replace Haig – none were. At the Supreme War Council at Versailles Haig and Pétain complained of shortage of troops, but Haig&#x27;s political credibility was so low that Hankey wrote that they &quot;made asses of themselves&quot;. It was agreed that an Allied General Reserve be set up, under Foch with Henry Wilson as his deputy; Haig was reluctant to hand over divisions and argued against a common command, claiming that it would be &quot;unconstitutional&quot; for him to take orders from a foreign general, and that he did not have the reserves to spare. Milner thought Haig&#x27;s stance &quot;desperately stupid&quot;.

Lloyd George proposed that the CIGS be reduced to his pre-1915 powers (i.e. reporting to the Secretary of State for War, not direct to the Cabinet) and that the British military representative at the Supreme War Council in Versailles be Deputy CIGS and a member of the Army Council (i.e. empowered to issue orders to Haig). He offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS with reduced powers or else accepting demotion to Deputy CIGS at Versailles. Derby summoned Haig to London, expecting him to support him in backing Robertson. In a private meeting with Lloyd George, Haig agreed with Robertson&#x27;s position that the CIGS should himself be the delegate to Versailles, or else that the Versailles delegate be clearly subordinate to the CIGS to preserve unity of command. However, he accepted that the War Cabinet must ultimately make the decision, and according to Lloyd George &quot;put up no fight for Robertson&quot; and persuaded Derby not to resign. Haig thought Robertson egotistical, coarse, power-crazed and not &quot;a gentleman&quot; and was unhappy at the way Robertson had allowed divisions to be diverted. Henry Wilson now became CIGS, with Rawlinson as British military representative at Versailles. Although Haig had been suspicious of Wilson, they gradually established a warily respectful relationship.

====German Michael offensive====
By March 1918 Germany&#x27;s Western Front armies had been reinforced by the release of troops from the Eastern Front. At this point British troops were tired and weakened, and British divisions had been cut in size from 12 battalions to 9. Allied intelligence did not fall for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans, but thought that the main attack might fall in the Cambrai-St Quentin sector. Haig inspected the Fifth Army (7–9 March) and noted widespread concerns, which he shared, at lack of reserves. As late as 17 March, Cox, who had replaced Charteris as Intelligence Chief, predicted that the German Offensive was not yet immediately imminent. By 20 March, deployment of German trench mortars had been reported by deserters, and British artillery began some spoiling fire.

Germany launched an attack, &quot;Michael&quot; (21 March 1918), with a force larger than the entire BEF and enjoying superiority of 5:1 over Hubert Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army, which were spread thinly over line recently taken over from the French. Haig was initially calm on 21 March, as owing to the communications of the time GHQ was &quot;an information vacuum&quot; where news often took over a day to reach him, and spent much of the day entertaining foreign dignitaries including the US War Secretary. The Third Army retreated as planned from the Flesquieres Salient. With three-quarters of the 50-mile front under attack, the British troops fought hard and the Germans failed to reach their first-day objectives. However, lacking reserves Gough had to retreat behind the Crozat Canal. 22 March saw the Fifth Army retreat to the Somme; Haig still anticipated further German attacks in Champagne or Arras. The Germans did not initially realise the importance of Amiens as an objective.

Haig did not speak to or visit Gough until 23 March. That day Haig arranged for reserves to be sent down from Flanders. Formal orders were issued to the Fifth Army to maintain contact with the Third Army to their north and the French to their south. After initial optimism, Tim Travers has written of &quot;panic&quot; setting in amongst senior officers at GHQ on 23 March, and there is evidence that a retreat towards the Channel Ports may have been considered.

====Doullens====
Haig had a GHQ Reserve which was massed in the north, 72 hours&#x27; march away, to protect the Channel Ports. The French Commander-in-Chief, Pétain, agreed to place two French armies under Fayolle as a reserve in the Somme valley, but could not agree to Haig&#x27;s request to send 20 French divisions to Amiens.

24 March was &quot;probably the most traumatic day (Haig) had endured since&quot; First Ypres in 1914. Half of BEF supplies came into Le Havre, Rouen and Dieppe and passed by train through Amiens, making it a major choke point. Planning that winter had left open the question of whether the BEF would retreat southwest or form &quot;an island&quot; around the Channel Ports through which Haig&#x27;s armies drew the other half of their supplies. A retreat on the ports does not seem to have been decided until some days after 21 March.

This is one of the occasions where doubt has been cast on the authenticity of Haig&#x27;s diary. For example, Haig&#x27;s typed diary – probably based on notes prepared in April – describes Pétain as &quot;almost unbalanced and most anxious&quot;, claiming that after attending a Cabinet meeting in Paris, where he had been ordered to &quot;cover Paris at all costs&quot;, he threatened to retreat on Paris, leaving the British right flank uncovered. Tim Travers argues that Pétain said at the meeting that he would only retreat on Paris if Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Pétain had come away satisfied that Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Haig Pétain denied that he had ordered a retreat on Paris or had threatened Haig that he might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported. It has been suggested that Haig and Lawrence may simply have misunderstood his intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig&#x27;s diary were honest if mistaken recollections.

Haig&#x27;s letter of 25 March, sent via Weygand, asked for 20 French divisions to cover the southern British flank as the BEF fought its way back &quot;covering the Channel Ports&quot;. The letter is ambiguous and does not specifically mention a retreat &quot;to&quot; the ports. Sheffield argues that orders to Third Army were not a precursor to retreat but &quot;a means to an end&quot;, pointing to orders for, if needs be, a counterattack onto the northern flank of the German attackers, and also argues that although GHQ had a duty to consider contingency plans, unlike in 1940, evacuation was never actually likely. Wilson claimed that Haig suggested Pétain be appointed Allied generalissimo (which is not consistent with Haig&#x27;s later claim that Pétain was unwilling to help the British) and that he proposed Foch over Haig&#x27;s objections.

At the Doullens Conference (26 March), Haig accepted the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed much of the credit for Foch&#x27;s appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Pétain than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Pétain&#x27;s recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig&#x27;s official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously.

After a German offensive near Arras (&quot;Mars&quot;, 28 March) was beaten back, between 29 and 31 March the Germans pushed on Amiens. A Canadian brigade took part in an action at Moreuil Wood. Attacks on 4 April (Villers-Bretonneux, east of Amiens) and 5 April on the Third Army front were beaten back by British and Australian forces, although contingency plans were still being prepared to cover Rouen and Le Havre in case Amiens fell.

====German Georgette offensive====
Lloyd George demanded Haig sack Gough, and when Haig was reluctant he was given a direct order to do so by Derby. Haig offered to resign; Lloyd George wanted to accept, but the other ministers, and Henry Wilson, thought there was no obvious successor.

During the second major German offensive, &quot;Georgette&quot; in Flanders (9 April), Haig issued his famous order that his men must carry on fighting &quot;With Our Backs to the Wall and believing in the Justice of our Cause&quot; to protect &quot;the safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind&quot;. Just as &quot;Michael&quot; had swept over the Cambrai and the Somme battlefields, won at such cost by Haig&#x27;s own offensives in previous years, this one swept over Passchendaele although not Ypres itself. The offensive threatened Hazebrouck, &quot;the Amiens of the north&quot;, a key railhead through which supplies were brought from the Channel Ports.

Foch had earlier refused to send four French divisions to Flanders but now redeployed Maistre&#x27;s Tenth French Army to the Somme sector, freeing up British forces. During a renewed attack (17 April) Foch drew attention to the valour of the British at First Ypres and refused to send further French reinforcements so as to keep a strategic reserve. 24 April saw a further unsuccessful German attack at Villers-Bretonneux near Amiens, featuring the first tank-to-tank combat. Haig was suspicious of Foch&#x27;s request to move British divisions to the French sector to free up French reserves, worrying that this might lead to &quot;a permanent Amalgam&quot; of French and British forces. At a meeting on 27 April meeting the dispute was smoothed over, and British IX Corps moved to the French sector. On 30 April Ludendorff called a halt to the Flanders offensive.

Although some American divisions were now serving with the British forces, Haig thought Pershing &quot;very obstinate and stupid&quot; for refusing to integrate US troops with Allied units. At Abbeville (2 May) it was agreed that in the event of renewed attack British forces would retreat south if necessary and abandon the Channel Ports rather than lose touch with the French.

The near-debacle of March 1918 was an object of political controversy. Repington wrote that it was &quot;the worst defeat in the history of the Army&quot;. Bonar Law claimed in a House of Commons debate (23 April) that Haig and Pétain had agreed the extension of the British line, which was not wholly true as in January 1918 the Supreme War Council had ordered a longer extension than Haig and Pétain had agreed between themselves in December 1917. Lloyd George was accused (in the Maurice Debate of 9 May 1918 in the House of Commons) of having hoarded troops in the UK to make it harder for Haig to launch offensives. Lloyd George misled the House of Commons in claiming that Haig&#x27;s forces were stronger (1.75 million men) at the start of 1918 than they had been a year earlier (1.5 million men) – in fact the increase was caused by an increase of 335,000 in the number of labourers, and Haig had fewer combat infantry holding a longer stretch of front. Haig had opposed Maurice in taking his concerns into public, but was disappointed at how Lloyd George was able to get off the hook with a &quot;claptrap speech&quot;. Maurice believed he had saved Haig from dismissal.

====German Bluecher offensive====
By late spring the BEF had taken just over 300,000 casualties. Battalions had had to be brought in from the Middle East. Haig spent time touring his forces in May. Haig&#x27;s wife reported rumours that he was to be brought home as Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces; when Wilson denied the rumours to Haig, Haig recorded that &quot;no one has been chosen yet!&quot; to replace him.

A third major German offensive against the French on the Aisne (&quot;Bluecher&quot;), starting on 27 May, overwhelmed Hamilton-Gordon&#x27;s IX British Corps which had been sent there to refit after being involved in &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;Georgette&quot;. At a conference at Versailles (1 June) there was friction between Haig, who was worried that the Germans would attack his sector again, and Foch, who demanded that the US divisions trained by the British be moved to his sector to release French divisions. Foch moved French forces down from Flanders, but there was further friction at a meeting in Paris about Foch&#x27;s request to move British reserves south. Haig threatened to appeal to the British government if he felt Foch was demanding too many British troops, so it was agreed that Haig and Foch should meet more frequently, and in time they developed a good working relationship.

Cooperation improved when the Germans launched their &quot;Gneisenau&quot; Offensive on 9 June. Lloyd George and Milner gave their full support to Foch on moving four British divisions. They told Haig that he should consider himself subordinate to Foch for the time being.

With another German attack imminent, Herbert Lawrence was asked (Haig was on leave in England) to send eight divisions – he sent only two. Haig thought this was breaching an agreement of 1 July that covering Paris and the Somme was to take priority. Wilson consulted the War Cabinet then told Haig to &quot;exercise his judgement&quot; about holding the British line. Haig felt that they would take credit for Foch&#x27;s victory but might dismiss him if disaster befell the British forces. The German &quot;Peace Offensive&quot; began against the French at Rheims on the same day. Haig eventually agreed that the French could use XXII Corps if necessary &quot;for exploitation&quot;.

====Turn of the Tide and the Hundred Days====
In July and August the Germans were defeated at the Second Battle of the Marne and Amiens. The latter victory was described by General Erich Ludendorff as &quot;The Black Day of the German Army&quot; after mass surrenders of German troops. On 11 August Haig, contrary to the wishes of Marshal Foch, insisted on a halt to the Amiens offensive and launched a new attack on 21 August between the Scarpe and the Ancre. As with his previous offensives in 1916 and 1917, Haig encouraged his subordinates to aim for ambitious objectives, in this case a thrust from Albert to Bapaume, and this time with more success than in previous years. On 10 September Haig, on a brief visit to London, insisted that the war could end that year and asked Lord Milner (Secretary of State for War) to send all available men and transportation. Milner afterwards shared with Wilson his concerns that Haig would embark on &quot;another Passchendaele&quot;.

Haig&#x27;s forces continued to enjoy much success, but when they began to advance towards the Hindenburg Line Haig received a supposedly &quot;personal&quot; telegram from the CIGS Henry Wilson (31 August), warning him that he was not to take unnecessary losses in storming these fortifications. Haig, surmising that the War Cabinet were not forbidding him to attack but might dismiss him if the assault failed, telegraphed Wilson back that they were a &quot;wretched lot&quot; and wrote that attacking the Germans now would be less costly than allowing them time to regroup.

There is some dispute over how much direct operational control Haig maintained at this time, Tim Travers in particular arguing that he allowed his Army Commanders a very free hand, whilst Ferdinand Foch was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Haig was irritated that Foch insisted that Plumer&#x27;s Second Army remain part of an Army Group commanded by the King of the Belgians, so that the French and Belgians could take credit for liberating Brussels.

Germany first requested an Armistice after the penetration of the Hindenburg Line at its strongest point, St Quentin/Cambrai, on 28 September, and the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria, and discussions continued until the ceasefire on 11 November. When consulted on terms for an armistice in October, Haig stated that &quot;Germany is not broken in the military sense. During the last weeks her forces have withdrawn fighting very bravely and in excellent order&quot;. In private correspondence Haig was more sanguine. In a mid-October letter to his wife he stated that &quot;I think we have their army beaten now&quot;. Haig noted in his diary for 11 November that the German army was in &quot;very bad&quot; condition due to insubordination and indiscipline in the ranks. Haig urged moderation, suggesting that Germany only be asked to give up Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine, and warning that humiliating terms might lead to a militarist backlash. Haig suspected Wilson, a staunch Unionist, of wanting to prolong the war as an excuse to subdue southern Ireland by bringing in conscription there. The collapse of Austria-Hungary encouraged the politicians to demand stricter terms (although less strict than Foch or Pershing would have liked) and Germany was required to evacuate the Rhineland as well. However, once Germany had accepted the strict armistice terms, Haig suggested Germany be split into independent states at the peace treaty.

Whereas the French, American and Belgian armies combined captured 196,700 prisoners-of-war between 18 July and the end of the war, Haig&#x27;s forces, with a smaller army than the French, engaged the main mass of the German Army and captured 188,700 prisoners. British daily casualty rates (3,645 per day) were heavier during this period than at the Somme (2,950) or Passchendaele (2,121), because British forces were attacking across the line, instead of being rotated through a single offensive. The military historian, Gary Sheffield, called this, the so-called Hundred Days Offensive, &quot;by far the greatest military victory in British history&quot;.

===Executions during the First World War===

As commander-in-chief, one of Haig&#x27;s responsibilities was to give the final signature to the death warrants of British and Commonwealth soldiers (but not Australian—these went to the Governor-General of Australia) who had been first sentenced to death by Field General Court Martial. Although the book &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot; (1983), which began the campaign for pardons, says that it is &quot;quite incorrect&quot; to hold Haig solely responsible as he was part of a legal process, by the late 1990s Haig was perhaps best known to the general public because of publicity which implied him to be a brutal disciplinarian—this was not the view of contemporaries. Of the 3,080 men sentenced to death in all theatres, 346 were executed, 266 (77%) were for desertion, 37 for murder and 18 for cowardice. Just over 250 of the executions took place during Haig&#x27;s time as Commander-in-Chief, but only executed men&#x27;s records survive, so it is hard to comment on the reasons why men were reprieved.

===Promotion of army dentistry during the First World War===
During the war, Haig suffered from toothache and sent for a Parisian dentist. Consequently, within months the British Army had hired a dozen dentists and, by the end of the war, there were 831. This led to the formation of the Royal Army Dental Corps in 1921.

==Later life==

Lloyd George arranged a ceremonial reception for Marshal Foch on 1 December; Haig was asked to travel in the fifth carriage with Henry Wilson but not invited to the reception. Feeling that this was a snub and an attempt to win votes for the imminent election, Haig declined to attend at all. In November 1918 Haig refused Lloyd George&#x27;s offer of a viscountcy, partly as he felt it was another snub, as his predecessor Sir John French had been awarded the same rank on being removed from command of the BEF, and partly to use his refusal to bargain for better state financial aid for demobilised soldiers. Haig held out despite being lobbied by the King, until Lloyd George backed down in March 1919, blaming a recently sacked pensions minister. Haig was created Earl Haig, Viscount Dawick and Baron Haig, of Bemersyde in the County of Berwick, received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and a grant of £100,000.

In January 1919, disturbances broke out among troops at Calais, as men returning from leave were expected to return to full army discipline and key workers with jobs to go to (who had often been the last to enlist) were – contrary to Haig&#x27;s advice – given priority for demobilisation. Haig accepted the advice of Winston Churchill that exercising his right to shoot the ringleaders was not sensible. For much of 1919, Haig served as Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, a key position as a General Strike seemed likely. Haig kept a low profile in this job and insisted the Army be kept in reserve, not used for normal policing. His military career ended in January 1920. Lord Haig arranged for his Dispatches to be published in 1922 as the General Election loomed, although in the end his nemesis Lloyd George was ousted for unrelated reasons.

After retiring from the service, Lord Haig devoted the rest of his life to the welfare of ex-servicemen. Haig pushed for the amalgamation of organisations, quashing a suggestion of a separate organisation for officers, into The British Legion which was founded in June 1921. He visited South Africa in 1921, Newfoundland in 1924 to unveil the National War Memorial, and Canada in 1925 to promote ex-servicemen&#x27;s interests. Visits to Australia and New Zealand were being planned when he died. He was instrumental in setting up the Haig Fund for the financial assistance of ex-servicemen and the Haig Homes charity to ensure they were properly housed.

An avid golf enthusiast, Haig was captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, from 1920 to 1921. He was president of The British Legion until his death and was chairman of the United Services Fund from 1921 until his death.

Haig maintained ties with the British Army after his retirement; he was honorary colonel of the 17th/21st Lancers (having been honorary colonel of the 17th Lancers from 1912), The London Scottish, the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, and the Royal Horse Guards. He was Lord Rector and later Chancellor of the University of St Andrews.

==Death==

Haig died in London from a heart attack on 29 January 1928, and was given an elaborate funeral on 3 February. &quot;Great crowds lined the streets ... come to do honour to the chief who had sent thousands to the last sacrifice when duty called for it, but whom his war-worn soldiers loved as their truest advocate and friend.&quot; The gun-carriage that had carried the Unknown Warrior to his grave in 1920 took Haig&#x27;s body from St Columba&#x27;s Church, where it had been lying in state, to Westminster Abbey. Three royal princes followed the gun-carriage and the pall-bearers included two Marshals of France (Foch and Pétain). The cortege was accompanied by five guards of honour, representing the Royal Navy, the Irish Guards, the Royal Air Force, the 1st French Army Corps, and the Belgian Regiment of Grenadiers. After the service at the Abbey, the procession re-formed to escort the body to Waterloo station for the journey to Edinburgh, where it lay in state for three days at St Giles&#x27;s Cathedral.

Haig was buried at Dryburgh Abbey in the Scottish borders, the grave being marked with a plain stone tablet in the style of the standard headstones of the Imperial War Graves Commission issued to British military casualties in the First World War.

The Earl Haig Memorial, an equestrian statue in Whitehall commissioned by Parliament and sculpted by Alfred Frank Hardiman, aroused some controversy and was not unveiled until just before Armistice Day in 1937.

==Reputation==
===Post-war opinion===

After the war Haig was praised by the American General John J. Pershing, who remarked that Haig was &quot;the man who won the war&quot;. His funeral in 1928 was a huge state occasion. However, after his death he was increasingly criticised for issuing orders which led to excessive casualties of British troops under his command on the Western Front, earning him the nickname &quot;Butcher of the Somme&quot;.

Winston Churchill, whose &quot;World Crisis&quot; was written during Haig&#x27;s lifetime, suggested that greater use of tanks, as at Cambrai, could have been an alternative to blocking enemy machine-gun fire with &quot;the breasts of brave men&quot;. Churchill also wrote that although the Allied offensives up until August 1918 had been &quot;as hopeless as they were disastrous&quot;, &quot;Haig and Foch were vindicated in the end&quot;. Churchill admitted to Lord Beaverbrook that &quot;subsequent study of the war has led me to think a good deal better of Haig than I did at the time. It is absolutely certain there was no one who could have taken his place.&quot; Churchill&#x27;s essay on Haig in &quot;Great Contemporaries&quot;, written after Haig&#x27;s death, was slightly more critical, noting the government&#x27;s refusal to offer Haig employment after 1920, his emphasis on the Western Front and his lack of the &quot;sinister genius&quot; possessed by the truly great generals of history.

Lloyd George was more critical in his &quot;War Memoirs&quot;, published in 1936. He described Haig as &quot;intellectually and temperamentally unequal to his task&quot;, although &quot;above the average for his profession—perhaps more in industry than intelligence&quot;. Lloyd George&#x27;s biographer John Grigg (2002) attributed his vitriol to a guilty conscience, that he had not intervened to stop the Passchendaele Offensive. John Terraine, writing of the &quot;shrill venom&quot; with which Lloyd George sought to &quot;exculpate himself&quot;, called the memoirs &quot;a document as shabby as his behaviour at Calais&quot;.

B. H. Liddell Hart, a military historian who had been wounded during the First World War, went from admirer to sceptic to unremitting critic. He wrote in his diary:

John Laffin, an Australian military historian who had served in the Second World War, commented unfavourably on Haig:Haig and other British generals must be indicted not for incomprehension but for wilful blunders and wicked butchery. However stupid they might have been, however much they were the product of a system which obstructed enterprise, they knew what they were doing. There can never be forgiveness.

===Other historians===
One of Haig&#x27;s defenders was the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (&quot;The Educated Soldier&quot;) in 1963, in which Haig was portrayed as a &quot;Great Captain&quot; of the calibre of the Duke of Marlborough or the Duke of Wellington. Terraine, taking his cue from Haig&#x27;s &quot;Final Despatch&quot; of 1918, argued that Haig pursued the only strategy possible given the situation. Gary Sheffield stated that although Terraine&#x27;s arguments about Haig have been much attacked over forty years, Terraine&#x27;s thesis &quot;has yet to be demolished&quot;.

Australian historian Les Carlyon wrote that while Haig was slow to adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that such doctrine had much place in military theory, he was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, who seem to best grasp and exercise these concepts, especially later in the war. Carlyon also wrote that there was a case to answer, for his support of more dubious commanders such as Ian Hamilton, Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Hubert Gough.

====Tactical developments====
Critics, including Alan Clark and Gerard De Groot, argue that Haig failed to appreciate the critical science of artillery and that he was &quot;unimaginative&quot;, although de Groot added that he has had the misfortune to be judged by the standards of a later age. Paul Fussell, a literary historian, wrote in &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot;:
although one doesn&#x27;t want to be too hard on Haig ... who has been well calumniated already ... it must be said that it now appears that one thing the war was testing was the usefulness of the earnest Scottish character in a situation demanding the military equivalent of wit and invention. Haig had none. He was stubborn, self-righteous, inflexible, intolerant—especially of the French—and quite humourless ... Indeed, one powerful legacy of Haig&#x27;s performance is the conviction among the imaginative and intelligent today of the unredeemable defectiveness of all civil and military leaders. Haig could be said to have established the paradigm.

Military historian John Bourne wrote that Haig, although not familiar with technological advances, encouraged their use. He also rejected claims that Haig was a traditionalist and focused only on cavalry tactics. Cavalry represented less than three per cent of the BEF in France by September 1916, whilst the British were the most mechanised force in the world by 1918, supported by the world&#x27;s largest air force. The Tank Corps was the world&#x27;s first such force and some 22,000 men served in it during the war. The Royal Artillery grew by 520 per cent and the engineers who implemented combined arms tactics grew by 2,212 per cent. Bourne wrote that this hardly demonstrates a lack of imagination. Other historians, notably John Keegan, refused to accept that the British Army underwent a &quot;learning curve&quot;; despite this example, Bourne wrote that there &quot;is little disagreement among scholars about the nature of the military transformation&quot;. Popular &quot;media opinion&quot; had failed to grasp that under Haig, the British Army adopted a modern style of war in 1918.

There is no consensus on the speed of a learning curve. Tim Travers blamed the management of early campaigns on the ethos of the pre-war officer corps, which was based on privilege, with a hierarchy intent on self-preservation and maintaining individual reputations. As a consequence the army was poorly positioned to adapt quickly. Travers wrote that initiative was discouraged and that the ethos of the army was pro-human and anti-technological. The offensive spirit of the infantry, quality of the soldier, rapid rifle-fire and the idea of the soldier being the most important aspect of the battlefield prevailed. The lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and the power of artillery were ignored, which caused costly tactical mistakes in the first half of the war. The tactics that Haig pursued were beyond the mobility and range of artillery, which contributed to operational failures and heavy losses. Travers also criticised Haig &quot;and&quot; enemy commanders for seeing battle as perfectly organised and something that could be planned perfectly, ignoring the concept of fog of war. Travers wrote that top-down command became impossible in the chaos of battle. The lack of attention to lower levels of command in the early years of the war created a command vacuum.

Bourne considered this to be too harsh, arguing that Haig progressed along with other commanders of the Edwardian era in implementing advances in operational methods, technology and tactical doctrine. Bourne also wrote that it was difficult to reconcile the commanders of 1918 with the dogma-ridden, unprofessional, unreflecting institution depicted by Tim Travers.

Biographers Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (2004) state:
As a result of his determination to accomplish great victories Haig too often disregarded key factors such as weather, and the condition of the battlefield, placed his objectives beyond the range which his artillery could cover and incorporated in his schemes a role for cavalry which this arm was helpless to accomplish. These shortcomings, it needs to be stressed, were not at all peculiar to Haig. ... But the outcome, too often, was British operations directed towards unrealizable objectives and persisted in long after they had ceased to serve any worthwhile purpose. The consequence was excessive loss of British lives, insubstantial accomplishment, and waning morale.

====Casualties====
Haig has been criticised for the high casualties in British offensives, but historians like John Terraine argue that this was largely a function of the size of the battles, as British forces engaged the main body of the German Army on the Western Front after 1916. Although total deaths in the Second World War were far higher than in the First, British deaths were lower, because Britain fought mainly peripheral campaigns in the Mediterranean for much of the Second World War, involving relatively few British troops, while most of the land fighting took place between Germany and the USSR. When British forces engaged in Normandy in 1944, total losses were fewer than on the Somme in 1916, as Normandy was around half the length and less than half the size but casualties per unit per week were broadly similar. David French wrote that British daily loss rates at Normandy, in which divisions lost up to three quarters of their infantry, were similar to those of Passchendaele in 1917, while average battalion casualty rates in 1944–45 (100 men per week) were similar to those of the First World War.

John Terraine wrote:
He also wrote that British perceptions were coloured by the terrible losses of 1 July 1916, during which the British Army sustained 57,000 casualties, but that it should also be remembered that the British never suffered anything like the losses of June 1916, when the Austro-Hungarian Army experienced 280,000 casualties in a week, or of August 1914, when the French Army lost 211,000 men in 16 days, or of March and April 1918, when the Germans lost nearly 350,000 men in six weeks, or 1915, when Russia suffered 2 million casualties in a year.

Total British First World War deaths seemed especially severe as they fell among certain groups such as Pals Battalions (volunteers who enlisted together and were allowed to serve together) or the alleged &quot;Lost Generation&quot; of public school and university-educated junior officers. British deaths, although heavy compared to other British wars, were only around half those of France or Germany relative to population.

====Alleged falsification of records====
Denis Winter wrote that Haig protected his reputation by falsifying his diary to mislead historians. Barring a few disputes over contentious meetings, such as the War Council of early August 1914 and the Doullens Conference of March 1918, &quot;the overall authenticity of Haig&#x27;s diary is, however, not in doubt&quot;, not least because of the frequency with which its contents have been used to criticise him. John Bourne wrote that &quot;Winter&#x27;s perceived conspiracy would appear to be one of the least successful in history. The falsification of his diary seems equally inept, given the frequency with which its contents are held against the author&#x27;s competence, integrity and humanity, not least by Winter himself.&quot;

Winter wrote that Haig and the British Government had conspired with the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds, to show Haig in a better light in the Official History. These claims were rejected by a number of historians, including Robin Prior and Correlli Barnett. Barnett&#x27;s comments were supported by John Hussey and Jeffrey Grey of the University of New South Wales, who wrote that:
Donald Cameron Watt found Winter
Winter wrote that Edmonds did not canvass the opinion of veterans, which was untrue – some volumes were sent to 1,000 or more officers for their comments, as well as being checked against unit diaries down to battalion level – in some cases entire chapters were rewritten (or in the case of Passchendaele, the volume was rewritten several times in the 1940s, during disputes about the roles of Haig and Hubert Gough, who was still alive). Winter quoted, out of context, Edmonds&#x27; advice to his researchers to write a draft narrative first, then invite interviewees to comment over lunch: Andrew Green, in his study of the Official History, wrote that this was done deliberately, for memories to be jogged by the draft narrative and that senior officers were more likely to be frank if approached informally.

==In popular culture==
Haig appeared as himself in the films &quot;Under Four Flags&quot; (1918) and &quot;Remembrance&quot; (1927).

Haig has commonly been portrayed as an inept commander who exhibited callous disregard for the lives of his soldiers. Sometimes the criticism is more against the generation of British generals which he is deemed to represent, a view aired by writers such as John Laffin (&quot;British Butchers and Bunglers of World War One&quot;) and John Mosier (&quot;Myth of the Great War&quot;). Alan Clark&#x27;s book &quot;The Donkeys&quot; (1961) led to the popularisation of the phrase &#x27;lions led by donkeys&#x27; to describe British generalship. A critical biographer finds &quot;no evidence of widespread contempt for Haig; the claim that ordinary soldiers universally thought him a butcher does not accord with their continued willingness to fight&quot;.

Haig was played by Sir John Mills in the 1969 film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, in which much of the dialogue is taken from &quot;The Donkeys&quot;. He is portrayed as being indifferent to the fate of the troops under his command.

In the 1989 BBC comedy series &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, Haig, played by Geoffrey Palmer, makes an appearance in the final episode. Referring to the limited gains made during the 1915–1917 offensives, Blackadder says: &quot;Haig is about to make yet another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin&quot;.

In the 1985 Australian television mini-series &quot;Anzacs&quot;, Haig was played by Noel Trevarthen as a cold and aloof man whose scepticism about the fighting abilities of the Australian and New Zealand troops arriving on the Western Front in 1916 was aggravated by the conduct of the Australians behind the lines. The series also portrayed British Prime Minister Lloyd George having a strong dislike of Haig and wishing to see him removed from command in 1917.

<text>John Ogilby, Ogelby, or Oglivie (17 November 16004 September 1676) was a Scottish translator, impresario, publisher and cartographer. He was probably at least a half-brother to James Ogilvy, 1st Earl of Airlie, though neither overtly acknowledged this. Ogilby&#x27;s most-noted works include translations of the works of Virgil and Homer, and his version of the Fables of Aesop. 

Ogilby established Ireland&#x27;s first theatre in Werburgh Street, Dublin, and following the Restoration, that country&#x27;s first Theatre Royal. Ogilby played a significant part in arrangements for the coronation of King Charles II. Following the Great Fire of 1666, Ogilby&#x27;s large-scale map of the City of London was founded on precise survey work, and his &quot;Britannia&quot; is the first road atlas of England and Wales to be based on surveys and measurements, and drawn to scale.

==Life==
===Childhood and youth (1600–1618)===
John Ogilby&#x27;s birthplace and parentage are historically uncertain; most early biographies of Ogilby rely on the notes of his assistant John Aubrey that were made for Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, a collection of biographies of Ogilby and others. The accuracy of Aubrey&#x27;s account is questionable; Aubrey noted Ogilby was evasive about his origins, saying only he was born &quot;near Edinburgh&quot; in 1600 &quot;of a gentleman&#x27;s family&quot;. Later scholarship has discovered in 1653, Ogilby consulted the noted astrologer Elias Ashmole, and that Ashmole subsequently included Ogilby&#x27;s horoscope in a personal collection of his horoscopes of notable people. The horoscope required precise data; Ashmole gives the exact location of Ogilby&#x27;s birth as &quot;Killemeure&quot; (Kirriemuir near Dundee) and the exact date and time as 17 November 1600 at 04:00. 

Ogilby believed himself to be at least a half-brother to James Ogilvy, 1st Earl of Airlie, given at birth to John Ogilby (senior), a gentleman&#x27;s tailor in Edinburgh, to be adopted. He was most likely educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; grammar school in London. At eleven years old, Ogilby was indentured as an apprentice to John Draper, one of just three licensed dance masters in London. At the time, a dancing master had expertise in &quot;grammar (elocution), rhetoric, logic, philosophy, history, music, mathematics and in other arts&quot;: ability to dance in &quot;Old Measures&quot; was considered an essential skill for the upper classes. In 1617, Draper became a barrister at Gray&#x27;s Inn and released Ogilby, who by then was highly accomplished as a dancer and a teacher, from the apprenticeship, allowing him to set up as a master in his own right and to take part in theatrical performances. A fall while dancing in a masque in February 1619 (aged 18), however, lamed him for life and ended his career as a dancer, though not as a teacher.

===Early adulthood (1619−1633)===

Information about John Ogilby&#x27;s early adulthood is limited. According to Ashmole&#x27;s horoscope, in 1625, Ogilby suffered from a &quot;double quotidian ague&quot; – a form of malaria – he most probably contracted while fighting in the Low Countries under Colonel Sir Charles Rich. In May 1626, he is recorded as holding the rank of lieutenant in the army of Count Mansfield, subsequently becoming a prisoner of war in Dunkirk from July 1626 to June 1627. From June to November 1627, Ogilby was one of the few survivors of the ill-fated English Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré, returning to England as acting Captain of a supply ship.

===Ireland (1633−1646)===

In August 1633, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, the newly appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, invited Ogilby to Ireland to be dancing tutor to his wife and children, and a member of his troop of guards. While in Dublin, Ogilby established Ireland&#x27;s first theatre, the Werburgh Street Theatre. In 1637, as a consequence of this enterprise and to discourage competitors, Wentworth appointed Ogilby Master of the Revels for Ireland, with power to permit and forbid performances. The theatre remained open for four years; it had mixed success but it had to be closed as a result of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. With theatre and dancing ruled out, Ogilby spent his time learning Latin and then translating the complete works of Virgil.

===Writer and publisher, marriage (1647−1660)===
Ogilby returned to England in January 1647, being shipwrecked on his homeward journey. The manuscript of his Virgil translation, which he had carefully placed in waterproof wrapping, survived the incident and was published in October 1648 with the sponsorship of Royalist gentlefolk and nobility. 

In 1650, Ogilby married rich heiress Christian Hunsdon, a widow in her sixties and about 17 years Ogilby&#x27;s senior. The following year, he published the first edition of his work &quot;&quot;, which was illustrated by Francis Cleyn. Ogilby&#x27;s version of the text was very successful, running to five editions in the following 15 years. 

During the next few years, Ogilby learnt Greek with the intention of creating and publishing a new translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;; he planned it to be a magnificent undertaking with an estimated production cost of £5,000. The venture required sponsorship to pay for the engraved illustrations, each of which would cost about £10, but he secured only 47 sponsors. When the work published in March 1660, it had 600 pages but was substantially less illustrated than Ogilby had planned. With his known Royalist sympathies, Ogilby was a risk to potential patrons who needed to avoid offending the Puritan Commonwealth government.

===Restoration of the monarchy, the Great Fire and Royal Cosmographer (1661–1676) ===

The Restoration of Charles II brought favour back to Ogilby. In 1661, he was granted the unpaid title &quot;Master of the Royal &quot; (King&#x27;s Printer). With Charles&#x27; coronation scheduled for 23 April 1661 – St. George&#x27;s Day – the Common Council of the City of London contracted Ogilby to &quot;compose speeches, songs and inscriptions&quot; for the coronation procession from the Tower of London to Whitehall.

A year later, Ogilby was again made Master of the Revels in Ireland, and he started building a new theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin. The libretto of Katherine Philips&#x27; musical play &quot;Pompey&quot;, which was performed at Smock Alley in 1663, credits Ogilby as the composer of the tunes. His second sojourn in Ireland was short-lived; in July 1664, he returned to plague-stricken London, leaving his step-son to take his place. In 1665, he published a second, revised edition of &quot;The Fables of Aesop&quot;, which was this time illustrated with prints by Wenceslaus Hollar.

During the Great Fire of London in 1666, Ogilby&#x27;s house in Shoe Lane, together with its printing works and most of his stock, was destroyed; he estimated he had lost £3,000. After the Great Fire, the Corporation of London appointed Ogilby and his wife&#x27;s grandson William Morgan as &quot;sworn viewers&quot;, members of a group of four trustworthy gentlemen directed by Robert Hooke, to plot disputed property in the city. Ogilby later made what he called &quot;the most accurate Survey of the City of London and Libertyes therof that has ever been done&quot;. By 1668, he had a new house in Whitefriars, and was ready to resume his printing and publishing work. 

Ogilby&#x27;s next major venture was a series of atlases of China, Japan, Africa, Asia and America. The first of these was &quot;An Embassy from the East India Company of the United Provinces...&quot;, first published in 1669 for Ogilby by John Macock and then reprinted in better quality by Ogilby himself in 1673. This book was substantially a translation of Johan Nieuhof&#x27;s Dutch publication of the same name with English copies of the Dutch engravings, supplemented by the first English translation of sections of Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s &quot;China Illustrata&quot;, relating various information from the Jesuit China Mission. Ogilby&#x27;s &quot;Africa&quot; appeared in 1670 and was followed in rapid succession by &quot;Atlas Japanennsis&quot; (1670), &quot;America&quot; (1671), &quot;Atlas Chinensis&quot; (1671) and &quot;Asia&quot; (1673). In 1671, in response to his proposal to make a detailed survey and atlas of Great Britain, the King appointed Ogilby Royal Cosmographer. Thus, at about the age of 70 and with the scientific advice of Robert Hooke, Ogilby began work on &quot;Britannia&quot;, the project for which he is best known among cartographers.

====&quot;Britannia&quot;====


In 1675, Ogilby issued his atlas, which he titled &quot;Britannia&quot;, in the form of a strip map for each major route. The work contains 100 strip road maps that are accompanied by a double-sided page of text giving additional advice for the map&#x27;s use, and notes on the towns shown and the pronunciations of their names. The roads were measured using a surveyor&#x27;s wheel, which Ogilby called his &quot;way-wiser&quot;, and were plotted at one inch to the statute mile – a scale of 1:63,360 – an Ogilby innovation. The maps include details such as the configurations of hills, bridges and ferries, and the relative sizes of towns. Ogilby is noted in cartography for these innovations.

The cost of the survey and the resulting maps is not known but in a prospectus, Ogilby quotes a preiminary estimate made by the &quot;Lords Referees&quot; – advisors to the Privy Council – as £14,000 (equivalent to about £ million today). Ogilby worked hard to raise this considerable sum by holding lotteries, and with the help of Robert Hooke, who made multiple petitions to the Crown, the Court of Common Council and Court of Aldermen of the Corporation of London and to noble families. Writing in 1925, geographer Sir Herbert Fordham said:
twice only ... has there been such [measurement of roads]: that of John Ogilby, in 1671-5, and that of John Cary, quite at the end of the following century. In neither case, singularly enough, did the Government take any steps for the publication of the results of the survey, everything being left, in this respect, to private and commercial enterprise.

===Death ===
Ogilby died in September 1676 and was buried in the vault of St Bride&#x27;s Church, one of Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s new London churches. In his will, dated 27 February 1675, Ogilby bequeathed his entire estate to . The value of his estate is not recorded but the British Museum has a copy of an announcement by Robert Morden, a factor, of a sale of &quot;undisposed&quot; books and maps from Ogilby&#x27;s collection with an asserted value of £517.50 (equivalent to about £ today).

==Legacy==
In the years that followed his death, Ogilby&#x27;s reputation as a poetic translator suffered from attacks made on him by John Dryden in his satirical work &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot;, and by Alexander Pope in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;. Following their lead, Scottish philosopher David Hume used Ogilby&#x27;s work to illustrate the idea that common sense frequently appeals to a &quot;standard of taste&quot; in aesthetic matters:
Whoever would assert an equality of genius and elegance between Ogilby and [John] Milton, or [John] Bunyan and [Joseph] Addison, would be thought to defend no less an extravagance, than if he had maintained a mole-hill to be as high as Teneriffe, or a pond as extensive as the ocean.
Other writers were even more critical; Ogilby&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Londinensis&quot; (about 1800) reads:
The chief merit of his Homer consists in a commendable and uniform fidelity to the sense of his author. As a poet, his pretensions to praise of any kind can scarcely be supported: he has neither animation of thought, accuracy of taste, sensibility of feeling, nor ornament of diction.
Such judgements stuck, and it is only since the mid-20th century that Ogilby&#x27;s work has again been given scholarly attention, particularly his versions of &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;. These, according to a short biography published by Theophilus Cibber in 1753, were &quot;generally confessed to have exceeded whatever hath been done before in that kind&quot;. They renewed interest in the fable as a literary medium and arguably initiated suggestions of their adaptation to the troubled politics of the time.

<text>Joseph Robert Janes (born May 23, 1935) is a Canadian author born in Toronto.

A mining engineer by profession, he taught geology, geography and high school mathematics and later geology at Brock University until he dedicated himself to writing full-time in 1970.

Janes has published more than 20 adult novels, five mystery novels for young adults, and textbooks on the subject of geology. His character-rich mysteries set in Occupied France during World War II, and featuring Chief Inspector Jean-Louis St-Cyr of the Sûreté and Detektiv Inspektor Hermann Kohler of the Nazi Gestapo, are his most popular works and have been critically acclaimed by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, amongst others, for their historical accuracy. The U.S.-based Western Society for French History used his writings as a study of the convergence of fiction with history.

<text>Jean-François Oeben, or Johann Franz Oeben (9 October 1721 – 21 January 1763) was a German ébéniste (cabinetmaker) whose career was spent in Paris. He was the maternal grandfather of the painter Eugène Delacroix.

==Life and career==
Nothing is securely known about his training. He was in Paris by about 1740; from 1749 he lived in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.

During 1751 – 1754 he worked as &quot;compagnon&quot; at the workshop of Charles-Joseph Boulle, son of the great &quot;ébeniste&quot; of Louis XIV, André Charles Boulle, and then independently in premises in the Galleries of the Louvre sublet to him by Boulle. From 1754 he was granted premises, at first at the Manufacture des Gobelins, then, in 1756, in workshops and lodgings at the Arsenal.

Though he had workshops under royal appointment, throughout his career the royal cabinet-maker, &quot;ébeniste du Roi&quot;, was Gilles Joubert. Oeben worked for the aristocracy sometimes through intermediary &quot;marchands-merciers&quot;, providing extremely refined case furniture with marquetry of flowers that gave way, in the last years of his career, to sober geometrical tiled patterns.

Oeben worked extensively for Madame de Pompadour: in the inventory drawn up after his death there were ten items awaiting delivery to Mme de Pompadour. She had ordered many pieces of furniture from him in 1761, doubtless for the Château de Bellevue, and had already paid 17,400 &quot;livres&quot; on account. In the inventory after her death, there were sixteen commodes &quot;à la Grecque&quot; that must have come from Oeben, who was in the forefront of this first phase of neoclassical style; in the announcement advertising the sale of his stock after his death, it was explicitly stated that all was &quot;in a new style&quot; (Eriksen 1974:208). Not all of the furnishings for Mme de Pompadour had abandoned the rococo manner: at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a mechanical table stamped by Oeben and his brother-in-law R.V.L.C. has pierced cabriole legs, for an unusual effect of lightness and grace. Its mounts bear Pompadour&#x27;s armorial bearing, a tower, and R.V.L.C.&#x27;s stamp shows that it was one of the pieces in the workshop that was left unfinished at the time of Oeben&#x27;s death, completed and stamped by Roger Vandercruse.

Oeben&#x27;s distinguished marquetry appears at its most ambitious on the famous, minutely-documented roll-top Bureau du Roi, made for Louis XV, which was begun in 1760 and remained unfinished at his death; it was finished and delivered in 1769, signed by Jean Henri Riesener, but it was Oeben who devised its intricate mechanisms.

The known work of Oeben possesses genuine grace and beauty; as craftsmanship it is of the first rank, and it is typically French in its fluent, idiomatic character. His furniture is found in all the great national collections of decorative arts. The Museu Calouste Gulbenkian has a mechanical table made by Oeben for the comte d&#x27;Argenson which opens swing-away secretarial writing surfaces and a tilted reading easel with successive turns of a single key. At the J. Paul Getty Museum is a commode of ca. 1760 stamped by Oeben veneered in parquetry and reflecting the &quot;new style&quot; especially in its gilt-bronze mounts; it is fitted with an elaborate locking mechanism typical of Oeben. He is represented in the Victoria and Albert Museum by a pair of inlaid corner-cupboards. These, with a bureau and a chiffonier in the French national &quot;Garde Meuble&quot;, in which bouquets of flowers are delicately inlaid in choice woods, are his best-known and most admirable achievements.

== Family ==
On 29 June 1749 Jean-François married Françoise-Marguerite Vandercruse, the daughter of the &quot;ébeniste&quot; François Vandercruse called Lacroix, and so was the brother-in-law of another outstanding cabinet-maker, Roger Vandercruse Lacroix. Françoise-Marguerite bore daughter Victoire to Jean-François, and Victoire bore painter Eugène Delacroix.

Jean-François has sometimes been confused with his brother Simon-François Oeben (ca. 1725, Heinsberg – 1786, Paris), his employee since 1754, who married the other Vandercruse sister. Their sister Marie-Catherine married the &quot;ébeniste&quot; Martin Carlin in 1759.

His widow married his journeyman Jean Henri Riesener, who used Oeben&#x27;s stamp until he was granted its mastership in 1768.

<doc id="142660" wikidata="Q52517" url="?curid=142660" title="Bridge of Sighs">
<text>The Bridge of Sighs (Italian: &quot;Ponte dei Sospiri&quot;, ) is a bridge in Venice, Italy. The enclosed bridge is made of white limestone, has windows with stone bars, passes over the Rio di Palazzo, and connects the New Prison (&quot;Prigioni Nuove&quot;) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge&#x27;s Palace. It was designed by Antonio Contin, whose uncle Antonio da Ponte designed the Rialto Bridge. It was built in 1600.
== Etymology ==
The view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment. The bridge&#x27;s English name was bestowed by Lord Byron in the 19th century as a translation from the Italian &quot;Ponte dei sospiri&quot;, from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells.

==In culture==

Numerous other bridges around the world have been nicknamed after the Bridge of Sighs — see Bridge of Sighs (disambiguation).

The 1861 opera &quot;Le pont des soupirs&quot; (&quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot;) by Jacques Offenbach has the name of the bridge as a title.

The Bridge of Sighs features heavily in the plot of the 1979 film &quot;A Little Romance&quot;. One of the characters tells of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever.

&quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; is the title of the second solo studio album released in April 1974 by English rock guitarist and songwriter, Robin Trower.

A Bridge of Sighs is mentioned in the opening line of “Itchycoo Park” by the Small Faces.

Marillion, an English progressive rock band, mentions this particular bridge in their song &quot;Jigsaw&quot;. (&#x27;We are renaissance children becalmed beneath the Bridge of Sighs&#x27;).

Giles Corey, an American slowcore band, likewise mentions this bridge in their song &quot;No One Is Ever Going To Want Me.&quot;

Renowned American architect H. H. Richardson used the bridge as inspiration when designing part of the Allegheny County Jail complex in 
Pittsburgh. It was completed in 1888 and features a similar enclosed arched walkway that connects the courthouse and jail, therefore bearing the same name.

<text>Lana Michele Moorer (born October 11, 1970), better known by her stage name MC Lyte, is an American rapper. Considered one of the pioneers of female rap, MC Lyte first gained fame in the late 1980s, becoming the first female rapper to release a full solo album with 1988&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Lyte as a Rock.&quot; The album spawned the singles &quot;10% Dis&quot; and &quot;Paper Thin&quot;.

In 1989, she joined the supergroup Stop the Violence Movement, and appeared on the single &quot;Self Destruction&quot;, which was the inaugural number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles chart. That same year, she released her second album &quot;Eyes on This&quot;, which became one of the first albums by a female solo rapper to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. That album included the single &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot;. In 1991, MC Lyte released the hit single &quot;Poor Georgie&quot;, which marked her first appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her 1993 single &quot;Ruffneck&quot;, made her the first solo woman rapper to achieve a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 

In 1994, she collaborated with Janet Jackson on the song &quot;You Want This&quot;, and was featured alongside Queen Latifah and Yo-Yo on the remix track &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; by Brandy. Her 1996 single &quot;Keep On, Keepin&#x27; On&quot; featuring Xscape, reached the top ten on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2004, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance for the track &quot;Ride Wit Me&quot;.

Blige, Jay-Z, Moby, Aerosmith, Beyoncé and will.i.am, and has been cited as an influence to many women in hip hop. In 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; &amp; &quot;Vibe&quot; ranked her as one of the 50 greatest rappers.

In 2022 has her directional debut with the short film &quot;Break Up In Love&quot;. Lyte has worked with several charities, including her own foundation, &quot;Hip Hop Sisters&quot;.

==Early life==
Lana Michele Moorer was born in the Queens borough of New York City and was raised in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York City. She began rapping at the age of 12. MC Lyte&#x27;s original stage name was Sparkle. She recorded her first track at age 14, which was released 2 years later.

She regards Milk Dee and DJ Giz, the hip hop duo Audio Two, as &quot;totally like [her] brothers&quot;, because the three grew up together. Audio Two&#x27;s father, Nat Robinson, started a label for them, called First Priority. After making the label, Robinson made a deal with Atlantic under the condition that Lyte would get a record contract with Atlantic as well.

==Musical career==
=== Beginnings: &quot;Lyte as a Rock&quot; and &quot;Eyes on This&quot; (1987–1990) ===
In 1987, at the age of 16, Lyte released her debut single, &quot;I Cram to Understand U (Sam)&quot;, being one of the first songs written about the crack era. She was 12 years old at the time she wrote the song.
In April 1988 she released her debut album &quot;Lyte as a Rock&quot;. In addition to &quot;I Cram to Understand U (Sam)&quot; were released as singles &quot;Paper Thin&quot;, the eponymous &quot;Lyte as a Rock&quot;, and &quot;10% Dis&quot;, a diss track to then-Hurby Azor associate Antoinette. The album peaked #50 on the then &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Black Albums. Despite not having a great commercial performance, it is considered one of the best and most important rap albums, both in the 80s and in history. In 1988, The Village Voice magazine rated Lyte as &quot;the best female vocalist in hip-hop&quot;. Lyte was featured in the remix and music video of &quot;I Want Your (Hands on Me)&quot; by Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, which debuted in May 1988 on MTV.

In January 1989, Lyte joined the Stop the Violence Movement with Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy and Heavy D, among others. Together they released the single &quot;Self Destruction&quot; in response to violence in the hip hop and African American communities. The song debuted at #1 on the first week of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles existence and the proceeds were donated to the National Urban League. In late August 1989, her song &quot;I&#x27;m Not Havin&#x27; It&quot; with Positive K entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles, peaking at #16, becoming MC Lyte&#x27;s first appearance on a chart as solo artist. In October 1989, Lyte published her second album &quot;Eyes on This&quot;. This album, like its predecessor, received a great critical reception and is recognized as a hip hop classic. 

With &quot;Eyes on This&quot; she became the first solo female rapper to have an entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. From this album came the singles &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot;, the first time as solo artist she charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles and reached #1 on the Hot Rap Singles. &quot;Stop, Look, Listen&quot;, and the socially conscious &quot;Cappucino&quot;. In 1989 she also collaborated with Foster &amp; McElroy, known for their work with En Vogue and Tony! Toni! Toné!, in the song &quot;Dr. Soul&quot;. This single peaked #10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Songs.

In 1990, MC Lyte performed at Carnegie Hall.

MC Lyte&#x27;s DJ since the start of her career, DJ K-Rock, is a cousin, Kennith Moorer. Aside from a break in 1992, the two have toured consistently to the present. During that time she also had her own dancers, Leg One and Leg Two, who performed with her in shows and in music videos.

Greg Prato of AllMusic, referred to her as one of the first female rappers to &quot;point out the sexism and misogyny that often runs rampant in hip-hop&quot;, often taking the subject &quot;head on lyrically&quot; in her songs. &quot;The Birmingham Times&quot; has credited her for helping transition hip-hop from the &quot;feel-good, party vibe&quot; of the late 1970s into a &quot;socially conscious form of expression,&quot; as the rapper addressed issues like racism, sexism, and the drug culture had been affecting the African-American community. &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and NPR have cited her as a &quot;hip-hop pioneer&quot;.

Brown later said that the latter was part of a joke started by one of the hosts of the show Tyrone &quot;T Money&quot; Kelsie &quot;he came up with the marriage idea and then mayhem ensued.

Later these rumors were denied by Arnold. In May 2015, some media speculated that Lyte had dated R&amp;B singer Janelle Monae, but these rumors have not been confirmed by either of them.

In early 2016, she started dating Marine Corps veteran and entrepreneur John Wyche, after meeting him on Match.com. They announced their engagement in May 2017. &quot;What can I say, except thank you Lord!!!... It&#x27;s been a long time, this single life, and I thank you all for your prayers and kind words of hope,&quot; she wrote in an Instagram post dated January 21, 2017. &quot;God has sent me true love. For all of you waiting on LOVE- don&#x27;t give up – keep God first and he will see that you meet your match.&quot;

In August they exchanged their vows during a musical wedding in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Reggae Congo bands played as Lyte walked down the aisle, and the couple&#x27;s friend Kelly Price serenaded them during the ceremony.

<text>Sir William Quiller Orchardson (27 March 1832 – 13 April 1910) was a Scottish portraitist and painter of domestic and historical subjects who was knighted in June 1907, at the age of 75.

==Early years==
Orchardson was born in Edinburgh, where his father was engaged in business. &quot;Orchardson&quot; is a variation of &quot;Urquhartson&quot;, the name of a Highland sept settled on Loch Ness, from which the painter is descended.

At the age of fifteen, Orchardson was sent to Edinburgh&#x27;s renowned art school, the Trustees&#x27; Academy, then under the mastership of Robert Scott Lauder, where he had as fellow-students most of those who afterwards shed lustre on the Scottish school of the second half of the 19th century. As a student, he was not especially precocious or industrious, but his work was distinguished by a peculiar reserve and an unusual determination that his hand should be subdued to his eye, with the result that his early works reach their own ideal as surely as those of his maturity.

By the time he was twenty, Orchardson had mastered the essentials of his art, and had produced at least one picture which might be accepted as representative, a portrait of sculptor John Hutchison. 

For the next seven years he worked in Edinburgh, some of his attention being given to a &quot;black and white&quot; style, his practice in which having been partly acquired at a sketch club, which, in addition to Hutchison, included among its members Hugh Cameron, George Hay and William McTaggart.

==Years in London==

In 1862, at the age of thirty, Orchardson moved to London, and established himself at 37 Fitzroy Square, where he was joined twelve months later by his friend John Pettie. The same house was afterwards inhabited by Ford Madox Brown. 

The English public was not immediately attracted to Orchardson&#x27;s work. It was too quiet to compel attention at the Royal Academy, and Pettie, his junior by four years, stepped before him for a time and became the most readily accepted member of the school. Orchardson confined himself to the simplest themes and designs, to the most reticent schemes of colour. Among his most highly regarded pictures during the first eighteen years after his move to London were &quot;The Challenge&quot;, &quot;Christopher Sly&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Swords&quot;, &quot;Conditional Neutrality&quot;, &quot;Hard Hit&quot; – perhaps the best of all – and, within his own family, portraits of his wife and her father, Charles Moxon. In all these, good judgment and a refined imagination were united to a restrained but consummate technical dexterity. During these years he made a few drawings on wood, turning to account his early facility in this mode.

==Later life==

The period between 1862 and 1880 was one of quiet ambitions, of a characteristic insouciance, of life accepted as a thing of many-balanced interests rather than as a matter of &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;. In 1865 Pettie married, and the Fitzroy Square ménage was broken up. In 1868 Orchardson was elected A.R.A. (Associate of the Royal Academy). In 1870, he spent the summer in Venice, travelling home in the early autumn through a France overrun by the German armies. His marriage to Helen Moxon occurred on 6 April 1873, and in 1877 he was elected to the full membership of the Royal Academy. In this year he finished building Ivyside, a house at Westgate-on-Sea with an open tennis-court and a studio in the garden. In 1891 he appears in a group portrait of a Royal Society soiree between the actress Ellen Terry and the organiser of nurses Rachel Ward, Countess of Dudley.

He died in London two and a half weeks after his 78th birthday, having been knighted less than three years previously.

There is a memorial which mentions Orchardson within Margate Cemetery, Kent. Now fallen over, its inscription reads:
In memory of William Quiller Orchardson (Knight) R.A., H.R.S.A, D.C.L, and Officer of the Legion of Honour. Born 27 March 1833, died 13 April 1910.Ellen Orchardson his wife born 5 May 1853, died 13 May 1917.Capt. Charles Moxon Quiller Orchardson born 24 December 1873, died of wounds in Egypt 26 April 1917.
Celeste Orchardson born 24 December 1876, died 30 August 1877.

==Legacy==
Orchardson&#x27;s wider popularity dates from 1880. To that year&#x27;s Royal Academy summer exhibition he sent the large &quot;Napoleon on board the Bellerophon&quot;, which was acquired for the national collection by the Trustees of the Chantrey Bequest for Tate. For a decade or more, Orchardson&#x27;s work was eagerly looked for at the Academy. He followed up the &quot;Napoleon on the Bellerophon&quot;, with &quot;Voltaire&quot; at the Academy of 1883. Technically, the &quot;Voltaire&quot; is, perhaps, his high-water mark; the subject does not explain itself, but requires a previous knowledge on the part of the spectator of how Voltaire was beaten by the servants of the Chevalier de Rohan-Chabot, and how the duc de Sully failed to avenge his guest.

The &quot;Voltaire&quot; was followed, in 1884, by the &quot;Marriage de convenance&quot;, perhaps the most popular of all Orchardson&#x27;s pictures; in 1885, by &quot;The Salon of Madame Récamier&quot;; in 1886, by &quot;After&quot;, the sequel to the &quot;Marriage de convenance&quot;, and &quot;A Tender Chord&quot;; in 1887, by &quot;The First Cloud&quot;; in 1888, by &quot;Her Mother&#x27;s Voice&quot;; and in 1889, by &quot;The Young Duke&quot;, a canvas on which he returned to much the same pictorial scheme as that of the &quot;Voltaire&quot;. Subsequently, he exhibited a series of pictures in which pictorial use was made of the Empire style, the subjects, as a rule, being only just enough to suggest a title. &quot;An Enigma&quot;, &quot;A Social Eddy&quot;, &quot;Reflections&quot;, &quot;If music be the food of love, play on!&quot;, &quot;Music, when sweet voices die, vibrates on the memory&quot;, &quot;Her First Dance&quot; — in these, opportunities are made to introduce old keyboard instruments, Aubusson carpets, and short-waisted gowns.

Orchardson in &quot;Master Baby&quot; connected subject-painting with portraiture. &quot;Mrs Joseph&quot;, &quot;Mrs Ralli&quot;, &quot;Sir Andrew Walker, Bart.&quot;, &quot;Charles Moxon, Esq.&quot;, &quot;Mrs Orchardson&quot;, &quot;Conditional Neutrality&quot; (a portrait of Orchardson&#x27;s eldest son as a boy of six), &quot;Lord Rookwood&quot;, &quot;The Provost of Aberdeen&quot; and, notably, &quot;Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart.&quot;, were distinguished portraits. The major commission received by Orchardson as a portrait-painter was that for the Royal group of Queen Victoria with her son (afterwards King Edward VII), grandson and great-grandson, to be painted on one canvas for the Royal Agricultural Society. He continued painting to the end of his life, and had three portraits ready for the Royal Academy in the final year of his life, 1910.

<doc id="142668" wikidata="Q130059" url="?curid=142668" title="Matthew Hale (jurist)">
<text>Sir Matthew Hale (1 November 1609 – 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and jurist most noted for his treatise &quot;Historia Placitorum Coronæ&quot;, or &quot;The History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot;.

Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father&#x27;s relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father, thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628, he joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. 

Despite the Royalist loss, Hale&#x27;s reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission&#x27;s dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas.

Hale sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II&#x27;s reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.

Hale&#x27;s published works were particularly influential in the development of English common law. His &quot;Historia Placitorum Coronæ&quot;, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered &quot;of the highest authority&quot;, while his &quot;Analysis of the Common Law&quot; is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;. Hale&#x27;s jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke&#x27;s &quot;appeal to reason&quot; and John Selden&#x27;s &quot;appeal to contract&quot;, while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s theory of natural law. Hale wrote that a man could not be charged with marital rape, and that view was widely held until the 1990s. However, he eliminated the previous rape defence that existed in English law for an unmarried man cohabiting with a woman.

Modern scholars also offer criticism of Hale for his execution of at least two women for witchcraft in the Bury St Edmunds witch trials and his belief that capital punishment should extend to those as young as fourteen.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Hale was born on 1 November 1609 in West End House (now known as &quot;The Grange&quot; or &quot;Alderley Grange&quot;) in Alderley, Gloucestershire to Robert Hale, a barrister of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and Joanna Poyntz. His father gave up his practice as a barrister several years before Hale&#x27;s birth &quot;because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings&quot;. This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury, through claiming a (false) allegation about this right. Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact, and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors. 

Although in common use, Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and &quot;contrary to the exactness of truth and justice which became a Christian; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country&quot;. John Hostettler, in his biography of Matthew Hale, points out that his father&#x27;s concerns about giving colour in pleadings could not have been very strong &quot;since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife&#x27;s inherited income, but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law&quot;.

Both of Hale&#x27;s parents died before he was five; Joanna in 1612, and Robert in 1614. It was then revealed that Robert had been so generous in giving money to the poor that at his death his estate provided only £100 of income a year, of which £20 was to be paid to the local poor. Hale thus passed into the care of Anthony Kingscot, one of his father&#x27;s relatives. A strong Puritan, Kingscot had Hale taught by a Mr. Stanton, the vicar of Wotton known as the &quot;scandalous vicar&quot; due to his extremist puritan views. On 20 October 1626, at the age of 16, Hale matriculated at the University of Oxford as a member of Magdalen Hall, with the goal of becoming a priest. 

Both Kingscot and Stanton had intended this to be his career, and his education had been conducted with that in mind. He was taught by Obadiah Sedgwick, another Puritan, and excelled in both his studies and fencing. Hale also regularly attended church, private prayer-meetings, and was described as &quot;simple in his attire, and rather aesthetic&quot;. After a company of actors came to Oxford, Hale attended so many plays and other social activities that his studies began to suffer, and he began to turn away from Puritanism. In light of this, he abandoned his desire to become a priest and instead decided to become a soldier. His relatives were unable to persuade him to become a priest, or even a lawyer, with Hale describing lawyers as &quot;a barbarous set of people unfit for anything but their own trade&quot;.

His plans to become a soldier died after a legal battle concerning his estate, in which he consulted John Glanville. Glanville successfully persuaded Hale to become a lawyer, and, after leaving Oxford at the age of 20 before obtaining a degree, he joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 8 November 1628. Fearing that the theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at Oxford, he swore &quot;never to see a stage-play again&quot;. At around this time he was drinking with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted; Hale prayed to God to forgive and save his friend, and forgive him for his previous excesses. His friend recovered, and Hale was restored to his Puritan faith, never drinking to someone&#x27;s health again (not even drinking to the King) and going to church every Sunday for 36 years. He instead settled into his studies, working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns. As well as reading the law reports and statutes, Hale also studied the Roman civil law and jurisprudence. Outside of the law, Hale studied anatomy, history, philosophy and mathematics. He refused to read the news or attend social events, and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church.

===Civil War, Commonwealth and Protectorate===

====Barrister====

On 17 May 1636, Hale was called to the Bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and immediately became the pupil of William Noy. Hale and Noy became close friends, to the point where he was referred to as &quot;the young Noy&quot;, and more crucially he also met and befriended John Selden, a &quot;man of almost universal learning, whose theories were to dominate much of [Hale&#x27;s] later thought&quot;. Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside the law, and much of Hale&#x27;s written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory. 

Hale gained a good legal practice, although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work. He sought to help the court reach a just verdict, whatever his client&#x27;s concerns, and normally returned half his fee or charged a standard fee of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate. He refused to accept unjust cases, and always tried to be on the &quot;right&quot; side of any case; John Campbell wrote that &quot;If he saw that a cause was unjust, he for a great while would not meddle further in it but to give his advice that it was so; if the parties after that would go on, they were to seek another counsellor, for he would assist none in acts of injustice&quot;.

Despite this, he was wealthy enough to purchase land worth £4,200 in 1648 (). He was in great demand; law reporters began recording his cases and in 1641 he advised Thomas Wentworth, the first Earl of Strafford, over his attainder for high treason. Although unsuccessful, Hale was then called to represent William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, during his impeachment by the House of Lords in October 1644. 

Hale, along with John Herne, argued that none of Laud&#x27;s alleged offences constituted treason, and that the Treason Act 1351 had abolished all common law treasons. John Wilde, arguing for the prosecution, admitted that none of Laud&#x27;s actions amounted to treason, but argued that all of them together did. Herne, in his arguments written by Hale, retorted that &quot;I crave your mercy, [Wilde]. I never understood before this time that two hundred couple of black rabbits would make a black horse!&quot; The case against Laud began to fail, but Parliament issued an Act of Attainder which declared him guilty, and sentenced him to death. After the capture of Charles I, Hale was expected to defend him, and indeed offered to do so; the King refused to submit to the court, claiming he did not recognise its jurisdiction. Edward Foss writes, based on the statement of Charles Runnington, that it was Hale who actually provided the King with this defence, and that it was only because the defence prevented any counsel being called for the King that Hale did not appear in court.

When it became clear that the King was losing the Civil War, and only Oxford held out, Hale decided to act as a commissioner to negotiate its surrender, fearing that the city might otherwise be destroyed. Thanks to his intercession, honourable terms were reached, and the libraries preserved. Despite practising in the politically charged environment of the English Civil War and primarily defending opponents of the resulting Commonwealth of England, Hale&#x27;s reputation did not suffer. First, he largely kept out of the war, even ignoring news of its progress, and instead translating &quot;The Life and Death of Pomponious Atticus&quot; into English. 

Second, he was acknowledged as universally able and of high integrity during his cases, retorting to those who complained of his defence of the Royalists that he was &quot;pleading in defence of the laws which they professed they would maintain and preserve; and that he was doing his duty to his client and was not to be daunted by such threatenings&quot;.

====Hale Commission====

During the rule of both the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, there was considerable desire for law reform. Many judges and lawyers were corrupt, and the criminal law followed no real reason or philosophy. Any felony was punishable by death, proceedings were in a form of Norman French, and judges regularly imprisoned juries for reaching a verdict they disagreed with. 

Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament aimed to establish a &quot;new society&quot;, which included reforming the law. To that end, on 30 January 1652 Hale was appointed chairman of a commission to investigate law reform, which soon became known as the Hale Commission. The Commission&#x27;s official remit was defined by the Commons; &quot;taking into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law; and how the mischiefs which grow from delays, the chargeableness and irregularities in the proceedings in the law may be prevented, and the speediest way to reform the same, and to present their opinions to such committee as the Parliament shall appoint&quot;. The Commission consisted of eight lawyers and 13 laymen, which sat from 23 January approximately three times a week.

The Commission recommended various changes, such as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing defendants access to legal counsel, legal aid and the abolition of &quot;peine forte et dure&quot; as a torture mechanism. Dissolved on 23 July 1652 after producing 16 bills, none of the Commission&#x27;s recommendations immediately made it into law, although two (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) were brought into force through statutes by the Barebone&#x27;s Parliament. Almost all of the recommendations eventually became part of English law, with John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, writing that if the measures had been put into law immediately, &quot;we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing our legal system and the concept of justice&quot;.

====Justice of the Common Pleas====
Oliver Cromwell, noting Hale&#x27;s abilities, asked him to become a Justice of the Common Pleas. Although Hale considered that taking this commission would make others think he supported the Commonwealth, he was persuaded to do so, replacing John Puleston. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges, and as such Hale was made a Serjeant on 25 January 1653. He was formally appointed a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, one of the three principal Westminster courts, on 31 January 1653, on the condition that he &quot;would not be required to acknowledge the usurper&#x27;s authority&quot;. He also refused to put people to death for offences against the government; he believed that because the government authorising him to do so was an illegal one, &quot;putting men to death on that account was murder&quot;. William Blackstone later wrote that &quot;if judgment of death be given by a judge not authorized by lawful commission, and execution is done accordingly, the judge is guilty of murder; and upon this argument Sir Matthew Hale himself, though he accepted the place of a judge of the Common Pleas under Cromwell&#x27;s government, yet declined to sit on the crown side at the assizes, and try prisoners, having very strong objections to the legality of the usurper&#x27;s commission&quot;. Hale also made decisions which negatively impacted on the Commonwealth, executing a soldier for murdering a civilian in 1655, and actively refusing to attend a court hearing outside term time. On another occasion, Cromwell personally selected a jury in a trial he was concerned with, something contrary to law; as a result, Hale dismissed the jury and refused to hear the case. On 15 May 1659, Hale chose to retire, and was replaced by John Archer.

====Member of Parliament====

On 3 September 1654, the First Protectorate Parliament was called; of the 400 English members, only two were lawyers – Hooke, a Baron of the Exchequer, and Hale, who was elected Member of Parliament for his home county of Gloucestershire. Hale was an active MP, persuading the Commons to reject a motion to destroy the Tower of London&#x27;s archives, and introducing several motions to preserve the authority of Parliament. 

The first was that the government should be &quot;in a Parliament and a single person limited and restrained as the Parliament should think fit&quot;, and he later proposed that the English Council of State be subject to re-election every three years by the House of Commons, that the militia should be controlled by Parliament, and that supplies should only be granted to the army for limited periods. While these proposals got support, Cromwell refused to allow any MPs into the Commons until they signed an oath recognising his authority, which Hale refused to do. As such, none of them were passed. Dissatisfied with the First Protectorate Parliament, Cromwell dissolved it on 22 January 1655.

A Second Protectorate Parliament was called on 17 September 1656, which wrote a constitution titled &quot;Humble Petition and Advice&quot; that called for the creation of an Upper House to perform the job of the former House of Lords. Cromwell accepted this constitution, and in December 1657 nominated the Upper House&#x27;s members. Hale, as a judge, was called to it. This new House&#x27;s extensive jurisdiction and authority was immediately questioned by the Commons, and Cromwell responded by dissolving the Parliament on 4 February 1658. On 3 September 1658, Oliver Cromwell died and was replaced by his son, Richard Cromwell. Richard Cromwell summoned a new Parliament on 27 January 1659, and Hale was returned as MP for Oxford University. Richard Cromwell was a weak leader, however, and ruled for only 8 months before resigning. On 16 March 1660 General Monck forced the Parliament to vote for its own dissolution and call new elections. 

At the same time, Charles II made the Declaration of Breda, and when the Convention Parliament met on 25 April 1660 (with Hale a member from Gloucestershire again) it immediately began negotiations with the King. Hale moved in the Commons that &quot;a committee might be appointed to look into the overtures that had been made, and the concessions that had been offered, by [Charles I]&quot; and &quot;from thence to digest such propositions, as they should think fit to be sent over to [Charles II]&quot; who was still in Breda. On 1 May Parliament restored the King, and Charles II landed in Dover three weeks later, prompting the English Restoration.

===English Restoration===

====Chief Baron and Chief Justice====

Hale&#x27;s first task in the new regime was as part of the Special Commission of 37 judges who tried the 29 regicides not included in the Declaration of Breda, between 9 and 19 October 1660. All were found guilty of treason, and 10 of them were hanged, drawn and quartered. Sitting as a judge in this trial led to some viewing Hale as hypocritical, with F.A. Inderwick later writing &quot;I confess to a feeling of pain at finding [Hale] in October 1660, sitting as a judge at the Old Bailey, trying and condemning to death batches of the regicides, men under whose orders he had himself acted, who had been his colleagues in Parliament, with whom he had sat on committees to alter the law&quot;. Perhaps as reward for this, he became Chief Baron of the Exchequer on 7 November 1660, replacing Sir Orlando Bridgeman. Hale had no wish to receive the knighthood that accompanied this appointment and so tried to avoid being near the King; in response, the Lord Chancellor Lord Clarendon invited him to his house, where the King was present. Hale was knighted on the spot.

There were many instances of parties to a case attempting to bribe Hale. When a Duke approached him before a case &quot;to help the judge understand a case that was to come before him&quot;, Hale said that he would only hear about cases in court. In another case, he was sent venison by a party. After noticing the man&#x27;s name and verifying that he had indeed sent Hale some venison, Hale refused to let the case proceed until he had paid the man for the food. When Sir John Croke, suspected in engaging in a conspiracy, sent him some sugar loaves to excuse his absence from a case, Hale remarked that &quot;I cannot think that Sir John believes that the King&#x27;s Justices come into the country to take bribes. Some other person, having a design to put a trick upon him, sent them in his name&quot;. Hale returned the loaves, and refused to continue until Croke appeared before him. Hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety, and through doing so &quot;secured the confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen&quot;. His knowledge of equity was considered as great as his knowledge of the law, and Lord Nottingham, considered the &quot;father of equity&quot;, &quot;worshipped Hale as a great master&quot;.

On 2 September 1666, the Great Fire of London broke out. Over 100,000 people were made homeless, and by the time the fire ended over 13,000 houses and 400 streets had been destroyed. An Act of Parliament enacted on 8 February 1667 constituted a Court of Fire, tasked with dealing with property disputes over ownership, liability and the rebuilding of the city. Hale was tasked with sitting in this court, which met in Clifford&#x27;s Inn, and heard 140 of the 374 cases the court dealt with during its first year in operation.

On 18 May 1671, Hale was made Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench after the death of John Kelynge. Edward Turnour replaced him as Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge, but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative. Roger North wrote that &quot;I have known the Court of King&#x27;s Bench sitting every day from eight to 12, and the Lord Chief Justice Hale&#x27;s managing matters of law to all imaginable advantage to the students, and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride; he encouraged arguing when it was to the purpose, and used to debate with counsel, so that the court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as the seat of justice&quot;. He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings, and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up. He disliked eloquence, writing that &quot;If the judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but a waste of time and loss of words, and if they are weak, and easily wrought upon, it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and biassing their affections.&quot; As a judge, however, he was noted by Lord Nottingham as the greatest orator on the bench.

====Retirement and death====
By 1675, Hale had begun to suffer from ill-health; his arms became swollen, and although a course of bloodletting relieved the pain temporarily, by the next February his legs were so stiff he could not walk. His initial attempts to resign as Chief Justice were declined by the King, but when Hale applied for a writ of ease the King reluctantly allowed him to retire on 20 February 1676, granting him a pension of £1,000 a year. He was replaced as Chief Justice by Richard Raynsford. After suffering for ten more months, Hale died on 25 December 1676 at his country home, The Lower House (now the site of the present day Alderley House). He was buried next to his first wife&#x27;s tomb in the churchyard of St Kenelm&#x27;s, the church which adjoined his home at Alderley, with a monument erected that reads:

His estate was largely left for his widow, with his legal texts given to his grandson Gabriel if Gabriel chose to study the law, and his more valuable manuscripts and books given to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. The male line of his family died out in 1784 with the death of Matthew Hale, his great grandson; also a barrister.

===Personal life===
In 1642 Hale married Anne Moore, the daughter of Sir Henry Moore, a Royalist soldier, and the granddaughter of Sir Francis Moore, a Serjeant-at-Law under James I. Moore and Hale had 10 children, but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman, with Hale warning his children that &quot;an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain, though she bring a great portion&quot;. Moore died in 1658, and in 1667 Hale married Anne Bishop, his housekeeper. Descriptions of Bishop differ; Roger North wrote that &quot;[Hale] was unfortunate in his family; for he married his own servant made, and then, for an excuse, said there was no wisdom below the girdle&quot;. 

Richard Baxter, on the other hand, described Anne as &quot;one of [Hale&#x27;s] own judgment and temper, prudent and loving, and fit to please him; and that would not draw on him the trouble of much acquaintance and relations&quot;. Hale himself described her as a &quot;most dutiful, faithful, and loving wife&quot; who was appointed an executrix on his death.

==Legacy==
Hale&#x27;s views on rape, marriage and abortion have had a long legacy not only in Britain&#x27;s legal system, but also in those of the British Colonies. 

According to Edward Foss in 2000, Hale was widely considered an excellent judge and jurist, particularly through his writings: he was an &quot;eminent judge, whom all look up to as one of the brightest luminaries of the law, as well for the soundness of his learning as for the excellence of his life&quot;. Similarly, John Campbell in his &quot;Lives of the Chief Justices of England&quot;, wrote that Hale was &quot;one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned&quot; of judges. 

In 1908, Henry Flanders, described Hale in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, during his lifetime as &quot;the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man to be found in the profession of the law&quot;. 

Hale&#x27;s writings have been cited by the US Supreme Court on numerous occasions. Justice Harry Blackmun cited Hale in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer in &quot;Kahler v. Kansas&quot;. In 2022, Hale&#x27;s opinion on abortion was cited by Samuel Alito in his opinion of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, generating political controversy.
In 1993, in the case of &quot;R v Kingston&quot;, the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that &quot;drunkenness is not a defence&quot; to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argued in 1923 that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he &quot;could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before&quot;. Hale&#x27;s political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed by Berman in 1994 to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; &quot;Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity&quot;.

Hale has frequently been compared with Edward Coke. Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer, because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science, and maintained judicial independence and neutrality. In 2002, Hostettler said, while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential, that Coke was better overall. While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality, and his written works are considered highly important, his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence. Coke&#x27;s active intervention allowed him to &quot;breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice&quot;, encouraging judges to be more independent and &quot;unfettered except by the common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold&quot;. 

J.H. Corbett, wrote in the &quot;Alberta Law Quarterly&quot; in 1942, that with Hale&#x27;s popularity at the time (Parliamentary constituencies &quot;fought over the privilege of returning him&quot;) he could have been just as successful as Coke if he had chosen to take an active role in public affairs.

===Writings===

Hale&#x27;s posthumous legacy is his written work. He wrote a variety of texts, treatises and manuscripts, the most major of which are &quot;The History and Analysis of the Common Law of England&quot; (published 1713), and the &quot;Historia Placitorum Coronæ&quot;, or &quot;The History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot; (published 1736).

The &quot;Analysis&quot; was based on lectures he gave to students, and was most likely not intended to be published; it is considered the first history of English law ever written. Divided into 13 chapters, the book dealt with the history of English law and some suggestions for reform. William Blackstone, when writing his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, noted in his preface that &quot;of all the earlier schemes for digesting the Laws of England the most natural and scientific, as well as the most comprehensive, appeared to be that of Sir Matthew Hale in his posthumous Analysis of the Law&quot;. Hale proposed the creation of county courts, and also drew a strong distinction between written laws, such as statutes, and customary, unwritten laws. He also argued that the common law was subject to Parliament, far before the confirmation of Parliamentary supremacy, and that the law should protect the rights and civil liberties of the King&#x27;s subjects. He also argued for the confirmation of trial by jury, which he described as &quot;the best mode of trial in the world&quot;, while the 13th chapter divided the law into the laws of persons and of property, and dealt with the rights, wrongs and remedies recognised by the law at the time. William Holdsworth, himself considered one of the greatest common law historians, described it as &quot;the ablest introductory sketch of a history of English law that appeared till the publication of Pollock and Maitland&#x27;s volumes in 1895&quot;.

The &quot;Historia&quot; is perhaps Hale&#x27;s most famous work. Pleas of the Crown were capital offences committed &quot;against the peace of our Lord the King, his Crown and dignity&quot;; as such, the book dealt with capital crimes and the associated procedure. The 710-page work followed the pattern of Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;, but was far more methodical; James Fitzjames Stephen said that Hale&#x27;s work &quot;was not only of the highest authority but shows a depth of thought which puts it in quite a different category from Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institute&quot;... [it] is far more of a treatise and far less of an index or mere work of practice&quot;. The book dealt with the criminal capacity of infants, insanity and idiocy, the defence of drunkenness, capital offences, treason, homicide and theft. Hale endorses the application of capital punishments to children in &quot;Historia&quot;, writing that &quot;it is clear that an infant above fourteen years is equally subject to capital punishments as others of full age; for it is &quot;presumptio juris&quot;, that after fourteen years they are &quot;doli capaces&quot;, and can discern between good and evil&quot;. 

In the 19th century, Andrew Amos wrote a critique of the &quot;Historia&quot; titled &quot;Ruins of Time exemplified in Sir Matthew Hale&#x27;s History of the Pleas of the Crown&quot;, which both criticised and praised Hale&#x27;s work while directing the main criticism at the judges and lawyers who cited the &quot;Historia&quot; without considering that it was dated.

Hale also reorganised the first of Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot;, which dealt with Thomas de Littleton&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Tenures&quot;; Hale&#x27;s edition was the most commonly used, and the first to extract Coke&#x27;s broader philosophical points. His written works, however, were fragmentary, and did not individually lay out his jurisprudence. Harold J. Berman, writing in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, notes that it is only &quot;possible by a study of the entire corpus of Hale&#x27;s writings to reconstruct the coherent legal philosophy that underlies them&quot;.

Hale&#x27;s writings on witchcraft and marital rape were extremely influential. In 1662, he was involved in &quot;one of the most notorious of the seventeenth century English witchcraft trials&quot;, where he sentenced two women (Amy Duny and Rose Cullender) to death for witchcraft. The judgment of Hale in this case was extremely influential in future cases, and was used in the Salem witch trials to justify the forfeiture of the accused&#x27;s lands. As late as 1664, Hale used the argument that the existence of laws against witches is proof that witches exist. 

Hale believed that a marriage was a contract, which merged the legal entities of husband and wife into one body. As such, &quot;The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract&quot;. This exception to the law of rape existed in England and Wales until 1991, primarily due to his influence, until it was repealed by the House of Lords in &quot;R v R&quot;. At the same time as he said a husband cannot be guilty of rape, Hale eliminated the previous rape defence that existed in English law for a man cohabiting with a woman (as opposed to being married to the woman), on the ground that cohabitation does not involve any contract.

According to a 1978 article by G. Geis in the &quot;British Journal of Law and Society&quot;, Hale&#x27;s opinions on witchcraft are closely tied to his writings on marital rape, which are found in the &quot;Historia&quot;. Geis argues that both arose from misogynistic bias.

Although Hale wrote voluminously, he published little in his lifetime: his writings were discovered and published by others after his death. There are still dozens of volumes of his manuscripts that remain unpublished, including numerous theological treatises. The majority of these manuscripts are found in the Fairhurst Papers at Lambeth Palace Library. His largest work in manuscript, &quot;De Deo&quot; (ca. 1662–1667), consists of ten books filling five volumes and is estimated to contain nearly a million words. There are also three copies of a treatise on natural law at the British Library. A critical edition of this treatise on natural law has been published as &quot;Of the Law of Nature&quot; (2015), which contains chapters on law in general and the law of nature. In the same work, Hale criticizes the reduction of natural law to self-preservation as &quot;the only Cardinall Law&quot; (the view normally associated with Thomas Hobbes), cites John Selden&#x27;s &quot;De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum&quot; repeatedly, and appears to share conceptual continuities with both Hugo Grotius&#x27;s &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; and Francisco Suárez&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore&quot;.

===Jurisprudence===
During Hale&#x27;s period as a barrister and judge, the general conclusion in England was that the repository of the law and conventional wisdom was not politics, as in Renaissance Europe, but the common law. This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke, who in his &quot;Institutes&quot; and practice as a judge advocated judge-made law. Coke asserted that judge-made law had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, &quot;a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics&quot;. This principle was known as the &quot;appeal to reason&quot;, with &quot;reason&quot; referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke&#x27;s theory meant that certainty of the law and &quot;intellectual beauty&quot; was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable. John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law was nothing more than a contract made by the English people; this is known as the &quot;appeal to contract&quot;. Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke&#x27;s theory. Along with Francis Bacon, he argued for natural law, created by the King&#x27;s authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke&#x27;s &quot;reason&quot; (the method used by lawyers) but through understanding the King&#x27;s instructions. While the judges did make law, this was only valid because it was &quot;tacitly confirmed (because not disapproved) by the [King]&quot;.

Hale&#x27;s legal theory was highly influenced by both Coke and Selden. He argued that the making of the law was a contract, but that it was subject to a test of &quot;reasonable&quot; character, something that only the judges could rule on. In this way, he sat in a middle ground between Selden and Coke. This was in conflict with the argument of Hobbes. In 1835, Hale&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Dialogue&quot;&quot; was discovered; Frederick Pollock posits that since Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Dialogue&quot; was first published in 1681, six years after Hale&#x27;s death, Hale must have seen an early copy or draft. D.E.C. Yale, writing in the &quot;Cambridge Law Journal&quot;, suggests that Chief Justice Vaughan had access to the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, and may have passed a copy on to Hale before his death. In his &quot;Reflections&quot;, Hale agreed with Coke that the judge&#x27;s task was to bring the reason of the common law (the coherence of the legal system) in line with the reason of the law in question (to justify that law). He disagreed with Hobbes that a layman could understand the law, saying that &quot;he that hath been educated in the study of the law hath a great advantage over those that have been otherwise exercised&quot;. The distinction between Coke and Hale is that Hale agreed with Selden that law was created through agreement, and disagreed that reason had an inherent binding power. Hale agreed with Hobbes that the interpretation of the law could not be left to individual reason, and that the law is not an exact science; the best that can be produced is a set of laws which give a reasonable outcome in the majority of cases.

<text>The Rev. Robert Hall (2 May 1764 – 21 February 1831) was an English Baptist minister.

==Life==
He was born at Arnesby near Leicester, where his father Robert Hall was pastor of a Baptist congregation. Robert was the youngest of a family of fourteen. While still at the same school his passion for books absorbed most of his time, and in summer he used to go to the churchyard after school with a volume, and read till nightfall, making out the meaning of the more difficult words with the help of a pocket dictionary. From his sixth to his eleventh year he attended the school of Mr Simmons at Wigston, a village four miles from Arnesby. There he showed an intense interest in metaphysics; and before he was nine he had read and re-read Jonathan Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Will&quot; and &quot;Butler&#x27;s Analogy&quot;.

This incessant study at such an early period of life seems to have affected his health. After he left Mr Simmons&#x27;s school his appearance was so sickly as to awaken fears of the presence of phthisis. He was sent to stay in the house of a gentleman near Kettering, who with an impropriety which Hall himself afterwards referred to as &quot;egregious&quot;, prevailed upon the boy of eleven to give occasional addresses at prayer meetings. As his health seemed rapidly to recover, he was sent to a school at Northampton run by John Ryland, where he remained a year and a half, and &quot;hath great progress in Latin and Greek&quot;. On leaving school he for some time studied divinity under the direction of his father and in October 1778 he entered the Bristol academy for the preparation of students for the Baptist ministry. Here his earlier confidence seems to have deserted him; when, in accordance with the arrangements of the academy, his turn came to deliver an address in the vestry of Broadmead chapel, be broke down on two separate occasions and was unable to finish.

On 13 August 1780, he was set apart to the ministry, but he still continued his studies at the academy; and in 1781, in accordance with the provisions of an exhibition which he held, he entered King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen, where he took the degree of master of arts in March 1785. He had no rival in any of the classes, distinguishing himself alike in classics, philosophy and mathematics. He there formed the acquaintance of James Mackintosh, who, though a year younger, was a year his senior as a student. While they remained at Aberdeen the two were inseparable, reading together the best Greek authors, especially Plato, and discussing, either during their walks by the sea-shore and the banks of the Don or in their rooms until early morning, the most perplexed questions in philosophy and religion.

Between his last two sessions at Aberdeen, Hall acted as assistant pastor to Dr Evans at Broadmead chapel, Bristol, and three months after leaving the university he was appointed classical tutor in the Bristol academy, an office which he held for more than five years. Even at this period his extraordinary eloquence had excited an interest beyond the bounds of the denomination to which he belonged, and when he preached the chapel was generally crowded to excess, the audience including many intellectuals. As a result of suspicions in regard to his orthodoxy, he accepted an invitation to make trial of a congregation at St Andrew&#x27;s Street Baptist Chapel Cambridge, of which he became pastor in July 1791. From the contents of a letter to the congregation which he left, it would appear that, while a firm believer in the proper divinity of Christ, he had at this time disowned the cardinal principles of Calvinism; and that he was so far a materialist as to &quot;hold that man&#x27;s thinking powers and faculties are the result of a certain organization of matter, and that after death he ceases to be conscious till the resurrection&quot;. It was during his Cambridge ministry, which extended over a period of fifteen years, that his oratory was most brilliant and most immediately powerful.

Hall began to suffer from mental derangement in November 1804. He recovered and was able to resume his duties in April 1805, but a recurrence forced him to resign his pastoral office in March 1806. On leaving Cambridge he paid a visit to his relatives in Leicestershire, and then for some time resided at Enderby preaching occasionally in some of the neighbouring villages.

Latterly he ministered to a small congregation in Harvey Lane, Leicester, and at the close of 1806 he accepted a call to be their stated pastor. In the autumn of 1807 he moved from Enderby to Leicester, and in 1808 he married the servant of a brother minister. He had proposed after an almost momentary acquaintance, allegedly in very abrupt and peculiar terms; it seems to have been a successful marriage.

On the death of Dr Ryland, Hall was invited to return to the pastorate of Broadmead chapel, Bristol, and as the peace of the congregation at Leicester had been to some degree disturbed by a controversy regarding several cases of discipline, he resolved to accept the invitation, and removed there in April 1826. He suffered badly from renal calculus, and increasing infirmities and sufferings afflicted him. Gradually the inability to take proper exercise led to a diseased condition of the heart, which resulted in his death. He is remembered as a great pulpit orator, of a somewhat laboured, rhetorical style in his written works, but of undeniable vigour in his spoken sermons.

==Works==
Hall&#x27;s first published compositions had a political origin. In 1791 he wrote &quot;Christianity consistent with the Love of Freedom&quot;, a defense of the political conduct of dissenters against the attacks of John Clayton, gave expression to his hopes of political and social improvements as destined to result from the subversion of old ideas and institutions in the French Revolution. In 1793 he expounded his political sentiments in a longer pamphlet, &quot;Apology for the Freedom of the Press&quot;. He was unhappy with the pamphlet, and refused to permit publication after the third edition. In a new edition of 1821 he omitted the attack on Bishop Samuel Horsley, and stated that his political opinions had undergone no substantial change.

His other publications while at Cambridge were three sermons: &quot;On Modern Infidelity&quot; (1801), &quot;Reflections on War&quot; (1802) (sermon given at Cambridge on 1 June to celebrate the Treaty of Amiens), and &quot;Sentiments proper to the present Crisis&quot; (1803).
Hall&#x27;s writings at Leicester embraced various tracts printed for private circulation; a number of contributions to the &quot;Eclectic Review&quot;, among which may be mentioned his articles on &quot;Foster&#x27;s Essays&quot; and on &quot;Zeal without Innovation&quot;; several sermons, including those &quot;On the Advantages of Knowledge to the Lower Classes&quot; (1810), &quot;On the Death of the Princess Charlotte&quot; (1817), and &quot;On the Death of Dr Ryland&quot; (1825); and his pamphlet on &quot;Terms of Communion&quot;, in which he advocated intercommunion with all those who acknowledged the &quot;essentials&quot; of Christianity. In 1819 he published an edition in one volume of his sermons formerly printed.

==Archives==
Papers of Robert Hall are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.

<doc id="142678" wikidata="Q373733" url="?curid=142678" title="Jimmy Chamberlin">
<text>James Joseph Chamberlin (born June 10, 1964) is an American drummer and record producer. Described as &quot;one of the most powerful drummers in rock,&quot; he is best known as the drummer for the alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins. Following the 2000 breakup of the band, Chamberlin joined Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan in the supergroup Zwan and also formed his own current group, the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. 

In late 2005, Chamberlin joined Corgan in reforming Smashing Pumpkins; he eventually left the group in March 2009, though he returned again in 2015 for a summer tour, and has officially performed with the band since then. Following guitarist Jeff Schroeder&#x27;s departure in October 2023, Chamberlin is the band&#x27;s second-longest serving member. He also performed in the group Skysaw until 2012 and joined Chicago jazz saxophonist Frank Catalano for a string of 2013–15 performances in the Chicago area. An EP by Catalano and Chamberlin &quot;Love Supreme Collective&quot; was released on July 29, 2014.

Chamberlin originally trained as a jazz drummer and cites jazz musicians Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Gene Krupa, and Buddy Rich, as well as rock drummers Keith Moon, Ian Paice, and John Bonham as major influences on his technique, and primarily strives for emotionally communicative playing. In 2008, Gigwise named Chamberlin the 5th best drummer of all time. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Jimmy Chamberlin 53 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Drummers Of All Time&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Chamberlin was born in Joliet, Illinois, one of six children in a Catholic family of English and Hungarian ancestry. His father and his older brother Paul were both active in jazz bands, playing clarinet and drums respectively, and his brother Paul is still an active rock drummer, with a local cover band, Chasing Amy.

Chamberlin began drumming at age nine. His early instruction included Latin, Brazilian, and big band techniques, but focused on jazz, under the tutelage of Charlie Adams, known for working with Yanni.

Chamberlin dropped out of high school and left home at age 15 and joined a series of local bands, culminating in a five year stint in local show band JP and the Cats. Although his early music career proved profitable, Chamberlin&#x27;s father pressured him into going to college. In 1994, Chamberlin revealed that he had been estranged from his father for seven years. After several years with JP and the Cats, Chamberlin, wearied by the touring schedule, reduced his role and got a job building custom homes with his brother-in-law. Before long, he was recruited into The Smashing Pumpkins.

===The Smashing Pumpkins===

The Smashing Pumpkins had been using a drum machine for early gigs, but were looking for a live drummer to open a show at Chicago club the Metro. Chamberlin and Billy Corgan met through a mutual friend, and Chamberlin expressed cautious interest, later recalling:

So I went out and saw the band – Billy, James, and D&#x27;arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that not only were the song structures good, but Billy&#x27;s voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.

Corgan had his own concerns:

He was wearing a pink t-shirt, stonewashed jeans, he had a mullet haircut, and he was driving a 280Z, and had yellow drums. We were sort of looking each other in the eye thinking, &#x27;This ain&#x27;t gonna happen, this is not the guy.&#x27; [But] he&#x27;d learned all our songs, as only Jimmy can, off the top of his head, and, within one practice, we were ready to play. It was amazing. We just knew right away. He&#x27;s that good.

Chamberlin made &quot;tons of cash&quot; as a carpenter, before giving up the job to move to Chicago and devote himself to the band. Chamberlin&#x27;s entry quickly pushed the band toward a more powerful, intense sound. 

During this period Chamberlin struggled with substance abuse. During the recording of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; in Marietta, Georgia, Chamberlin often disappeared for days at a time into the drug underworld of Atlanta, while the rest of the band feared for his life. He later said of his drug addiction that &quot;It&#x27;s pretty textbook [...] Guy makes it in rock band, gets very full of himself, starts thinking he&#x27;s indestructible, and all of a sudden he destroys himself.&quot;

In the midst of the lengthy world tour supporting 1995&#x27;s multi-platinum &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, Chamberlin&#x27;s father died, and his substance abuse hit a fever pitch. Of this period, Chamberlin later said, &quot;I learned that escapism was better than emotion, and that&#x27;s where I hid... It got to the point that I really didn&#x27;t care. Life was scary for me.&quot; Prior to shows scheduled for July 12, 1996 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health. Corgan later told MTV News that Chamberlin had already overdosed on two different occasions during the &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; tour prior to the July 1996 event, but that the band had managed to keep those situations private.

In October 1998, Corgan convened a band meeting in which Chamberlin was reinstated as the group&#x27;s drummer, and the band decided to break up after one more album and tour. The band yielded two albums in 2000, &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot; and the freely distributed &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;, before performing a farewell show in Chicago on December 2, 2000.

===Other projects, 2001–2016===
Chamberlin went on to form Zwan in 2001 with Corgan. Although Chamberlin predicted that &quot;the band&#x27;s going to be huge,&quot; Zwan produced only one album, &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot;, before disbanding in 2003. Chamberlin formed his next project, Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, in 2004, and released its first studio album, &quot;Life Begins Again&quot;, in 2005. Chamberlin stated that, with the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, &quot;I just wanted to make music and not really be constrained to making a Zwan or a Pumpkins record.&quot;. On April 29, 2016, the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex released a new song &quot;Paranoia&quot; via Jimmy Chamberlin&#x27;s Official Twitter account 

===Skysaw===
While giving drum clinics in late 2009, Chamberlin announced his next project, a band called This. Describing the music as &#x27;progressive, symphonic pop&#x27; he reported that the band, also including multi-instrumentalists Mike Reina and guitarist Anthony Pirog, would record with Roy Thomas Baker in Washington, D.C. in early 2010.

This released their first album, a six-track release titled &quot;Great Civilizations&quot;, on November 1, 2010 as a digital download only, on both Amazon and iTunes. No official release announcement was made even on the band&#x27;s official website. Downloads from iTunes and Amazon were removed after there was confusion over the band&#x27;s name.

In March 2011 it was announced that the Skysaw full-length LP would be released on Dangerbird Records. On June 21, 2011, the new, extended 10 song LP &quot;Great Civilizations&quot; was released. The band subsequently toured with label mates Minus The Bear, performed hometown shows at Chicago&#x27;s Metro and the Black Cat in Washington, DC, and performed on the JBTV Television Show in Chicago, IL.

===Business ventures===
In 2011, after introductions by then 1871 CEO Kevin Willer, Chamberlin began working with the burgeoning Chicago tech scene as an investor and advisor. Chamberlin&#x27;s increased involvement with startups led him to an introduction to LiveOne Inc., a digital media company. Founders Tim and John Ganschow (of Chicago) were presenting their new social platform, CrowdSurfing, to an investment group that included Chamberlin. Chamberlin was impressed with the fledgling company and the CrowdSurfing technology and subsequently came on board to support the company both financially and as an advisor. In 2013 Chamberlin became Chief Executive Officer of LiveOne Inc. LiveOne Inc. has since partnered with Yahoo, YouTube, Live Nation, AEG, Vans, Phish, C3, Budweiser&#x27;s Made In America Festival, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, among others.

In November 2014 Chamberlin attended Web Summit, Ireland&#x27;s top tech conference. While there, he spoke of his time with the Smashing Pumpkins as well as on the future of digital music at the Web Summit Centre Stage with Adrian Grenier, Chris Kaskie, and Brian Morrissey. He pointed to digital as the medium for artists to truly express themselves and create art that connects with their fans: &quot;Artists are looking for a destination ... [and] digital gives them the opportunity to realize some of those destinations and package them in a way that allows them to be creative&quot;.

===Frank Catalano===
Chamberlin joined Chicago jazz saxophonist Frank Catalano in 2013 for a number of live performances in the Chicago area. Since then they have continued to play live shows and have released a series of albums together. On July 29, 2014, Love Supreme Collective - EP featuring Jimmy Chamberlin, Percy Jones, Chris Poland, and Adam Benjamin was released and quickly became the #1 selling jazz album on iTunes USA. The follow-up album, released April 7, 2015 called &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the iTunes Jazz sales chart and was the #1 charting Instrumental album upon its release in April 2015. It reached number 4 on the Billboard Jazz charts. On May 27, 2016, a 3rd collaboration between Catalano and Chamberlin was released called &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;. This record features David Sanborn.

===Revival of The Smashing Pumpkins===
Billy Corgan announced at an April 2004 solo performance that he and Chamberlin intended to work together again in the future. After appearing on &quot;Life Begins Again&quot;, Corgan announced plans to &quot;renew and revive&quot; the Pumpkins through a full-page advertisement in his hometown&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, on June 21, 2005. Chamberlin contacted Corgan to accept, and on February 2, 2006, MTV.com reported that he and Corgan had signed a new management deal with the Front Line Management, with a spokesperson confirming they had signed under the name &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot;.

Chamberlin and Corgan, without the other original members, decided to record an album alone. They played their first show in Paris on May 22, 2007, with three new band members. On July 10, the new album, &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, was released. Over the next year and a half, the band released more recordings and toured extensively.

On March 20, 2009 the Pumpkins&#x27; website announced that Chamberlin was leaving the band. Chamberlin released a blog stating that he left as he felt that the band would not further his commitment to music.

Chamberlin again joined the band as a touring member for the 2015 End Times Tour. Chamberlin remained in the touring line-up for the subsequent &quot;In Plainsong&quot; Tour in 2016 

Chamberlin and former guitarist James Iha rejoined on a permanent basis in February 2018, and the band embarked on their reunion tour, the Shiny And Oh So Bright Tour and released an album at the end of 2018, &quot;Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.&quot;. Chamberlin further contributed to the albums &quot;Cyr&quot; (2020) and &quot;&quot; (2023).

==Musical style and influences==
Chamberlin comes from a jazz background, and he notes jazz musicians Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and Billy Cobham as influences. He has also been compared to jazz drummer Dennis Chambers for his &quot;quick hands, furious snare rolls, and crackling rimshots.&quot; In general, he is one of the few hard rock drummers to combine a driving backbeat with jazz-like flourishes. When asked about his influences in 2007, he responded:

Aside from the obvious – Keith Moon, John Bonham, Ian Paice – I would have to say Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, any of the jazz greats – Gene Krupa, those people. I think, more and more, as I get older, I&#x27;ve developed my own rock style and I tend to pull more stuff from Elvin Jones and Tony now that I can incorporate it into a rock arena and kind of modernize it.

Other drummers that influenced Chamberlin around the recording of &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; included Bobby Caldwell of Captain Beyond, Lalo Schifrin&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; soundtrack, Weather Report, and Return to Forever&#x27;s Lenny White.

Through 2007, Chamberlin preferred not to use Pro Tools or click tracks, though has embraced both in more recent years. He uses the slide technique for double strokes on the bass drum.
Bandmate Billy Corgan has said of Chamberlin, &quot;he&#x27;s up there with Bonham, you know, that level of drummer, who has been able to play a variety of music and have his style impact the way people play drums. That&#x27;s the hallmark of a great drummer. And, right now, I think, pound for pound, he&#x27;s the best drummer in the world.&quot;

==Equipment==
On the Smashing Pumpkins album Zeitgeist and subsequent tour, Chamberlin used a Yamaha Maple Custom Absolute kit with 60° bearing edges, rather than the standard 45°. His kit consisted of two snares (5x12 and the main snare, his 5.5x14 &quot;Signature&quot; model – Yamaha SD-2455JC), six toms (12x14, 8x10, 9x13, and an 8x8 above his floor toms which are 16x16 and 16x18), a 16x22 bass drum. Around 2000, as seen in &quot;The Everlasting Gaze&quot; video from &quot;Machines of God&quot; album, he switched from Sabian to Zildjian cymbals. His setup included four crash cymbals (a 15&quot; thin and three Zildjian A customs – 15&quot;, 18&quot;, and 19&quot;), an 8&quot; splash cymbal, 15&quot; New Beat hi-hats, a 20&quot; China High, a 22&quot; K Constantinople medium ride, and a 22&quot; riveted swish knocker. He occasionally used a triangle on his kit, mounted above the hi hats. Chamberlin&#x27;s drumheads are Remo coated Ambassador on snare-side, clear Emperors on tom batters with clear Ambassadors underneath, with a Powerstoke 3 on the bass drum batter and Vic Firth 5B sticks. His signature snare drum is popular with other drummers – Chad Smith has been known to use it as a second snare drum.

On April 6, 2011, Chamberlin announced that he had switched from long-term drum manufacturer Yamaha to Drum Workshop. He has ordered a custom &quot;prototype&quot; Copper Lacquer Specialty with Chrome Hardware. The Shells are a ply combination of VLT Maple and Mahogany with no reinforcement hoops. The kick drum hoops are Solid Black Lacquer. The sizes are 5x8, 7x10, 8x13, 10x14 rack toms; 14x14, 16x16 floor toms; 16x22 kick and with a matching 5.5x14 snare; and a stainless steel 6.5x14 snare.

In 2015, Chamberlin began endorsing Sakae drums. His set up consisted of a 22x16&quot; bass drum, 13x9&quot; rack tom, 8x7&quot; rack tom, 10x8&quot; rack tom, 14x14&quot; floor tom and a 16x16 floor tom. His snare was a Sakae maple 14x6.

In 2017 Chamberlin switched from Zildjian cymbals to Istanbul Agop cymbals. In 2018, Chamberlin returned to Yamaha Drums.

<text>In set theory, an infinite set is a set that is not a finite set. Infinite sets may be countable or uncountable.

==Properties==
The set of natural numbers (whose existence is postulated by the axiom of infinity) is infinite. It is the only set that is directly required by the axioms to be infinite. The existence of any other infinite set can be proved in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), but only by showing that it follows from the existence of the natural numbers.

A set is infinite if and only if for every natural number, the set has a subset whose cardinality is that natural number.

If the axiom of choice holds, then a set is infinite if and only if it includes a countable infinite subset.

If a set of sets is infinite or contains an infinite element, then its union is infinite. The power set of an infinite set is infinite. Any superset of an infinite set is infinite. If an infinite set is partitioned into finitely many subsets, then at least one of them must be infinite. Any set which can be mapped &quot;onto&quot; an infinite set is infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite set and a nonempty set is infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite number of sets, each containing at least two elements, is either empty or infinite; if the axiom of choice holds, then it is infinite.

If an infinite set is a well-ordered set, then it must have a nonempty, nontrivial subset that has no greatest element.

In ZF, a set is infinite if and only if the power set of its power set is a Dedekind-infinite set, having a proper subset equinumerous to itself. If the axiom of choice is also true, then infinite sets are precisely the Dedekind-infinite sets.

If an infinite set is a well-orderable set, then it has many well-orderings which are non-isomorphic.

==History==
Important ideas discussed by David Burton in his book &quot;The History of Mathematics: An Introduction&quot; include how to define &quot;elements&quot; or parts of a set, how to define unique elements in the set, and how to prove infinity. Burton also discusses proofs for different types of infinity, including countable and uncountable sets. Topics used when comparing infinite and finite sets include ordered sets, cardinality, equivalency, coordinate planes, universal sets, mapping, subsets, continuity, and transcendence. Cantor&#x27;s set ideas were influenced by trigonometry and irrational numbers. Other key ideas in infinite set theory mentioned by Burton, Paula, Narli and Rodger include real numbers such as , integers, and Euler&#x27;s number.

Both Burton and Rogers use finite sets to start to explain infinite sets using proof concepts such as mapping, proof by induction, or proof by contradiction. Mathematical trees can also be used to understand infinite sets. Burton also discusses proofs of infinite sets including ideas such as unions and subsets.

In Chapter 12 of &quot;The History of Mathematics: An Introduction&quot;, Burton emphasizes how mathematicians such as Zermelo, Dedekind, Galileo, Kronecker, Cantor, and Bolzano investigated and influenced infinite set theory. Many of these mathematicians either debated infinity or otherwise added to the ideas of infinite sets. Potential historical influences, such as how Prussia&#x27;s history in the 1800s, resulted in an increase in scholarly mathematical knowledge, including Cantor&#x27;s theory of infinite sets.

One potential application of infinite set theory is in genetics and biology.

==Examples==

===Countably infinite sets===
The set of all integers, {..., −1, 0, 1, 2, ...} is a countably infinite set. The set of all even integers is also a countably infinite set, even if it is a proper subset of the integers.

The set of all rational numbers is a countably infinite set as there is a bijection to the set of integers.

===Uncountably infinite sets===
The set of all real numbers is an uncountably infinite set. The set of all irrational numbers is also an uncountably infinite set.

The set of all subsets of the integers is uncountably infinite.
