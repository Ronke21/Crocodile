<text>Cottonwood Heights is a city located in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, along the east bench of the Salt Lake Valley. It lies south of the cities of Holladay and Murray, east of Midvale, and north of Sandy within the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. Originally a census-designated place (CDP), following a successful referendum in May 2004, the city was incorporated on January 14, 2005. The population, as of the 2020 census, was 33,617.

The corporate offices of Instructure, Dyno Nobel, the defunct Fusion-io, Extra Space Storage, Breeze Airways, and JetBlue are located in the city.

==Geography==
As the city&#x27;s name suggests, its geography is dominated by a high ridge separating the valleys of the Big and Little Cottonwood Creeks. At the eastern edge of the city, these valleys narrow into the Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons within the Wasatch Mountains, respectively. This is reflected by the city&#x27;s official nickname, &quot;City between the canyons&quot;. The ridge is covered in suburban housing, but most commercial development has been restricted to the lower-lying areas north of the ridge (along Fort Union Boulevard, in Fort Union itself, and near Big Cottonwood Creek and the &quot;Old Mill&quot; in the northeast corner of the city).

State Route 190 and State Route 210 run near the eastern edge of the city and provide access to the canyons; they are the only state routes that enter the city. Interstate 215 runs along the northern border of the city, and State Route 152 touches the city at a point. The city is building a multi-use trail along the full length of Big Cottonwood Creek within its borders.

Cottonwood Heights is in the Canyons School District; Brighton High School is the only public high school. Butler Middle School is the only middle school within city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 6.8 square miles (17.6 km), all land.

==Demographics==
According to estimates from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute of the University of Utah, as of 2015, there were 34,234 people living in Cottonwood Heights. The racial makeup of the county was 86.57% non-Hispanic White, 0.81% Black, 0.60% Native American, 4.51% Asian, 0.88% Pacific Islander, and 2.34% from two or more races. 4.29% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Local media==
* &quot;The Cottonwood/Holladay City Journal&quot; (tabloid-style newspaper), covering local government, schools, sports, and features.

==Police services==


On January 8, 2008, the Cottonwood Heights City Council voted to create its own police department and withdraw from its current contract with the Salt Lake County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

East Mill Creek was settled in 1848. Its name derives because it was along the more eastern creek in the valley with a mill.

<text>Granite is a census-designated place (CDP) in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, adjoining the City of Sandy on the east. As of the 2000 census, the CDP population was 2,018, a decrease from the 1990 population of 3,300 largely due to annexations by Sandy. Salt Lake County has designated a Granite “Community Council” for purposes of planning and development. The Granite Community Council includes the area within the CDP as well as the rest of Little Cottonwood Canyon, extending to Snowbird and Alta. In 2009 there was an effort to make Granite a township that ultimately failed.

==History==
Granite began as the site of the stone quarry for the Salt Lake Temple in 1859. By 1877 there were also several farmers in the area and an LDS ward was organized.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.8 km2), all land. The majority of the land extends into Little Cottonwood Canyon.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,018 people, 609 households, and 537 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 1,374.0 people per square mile (530.0/km2).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.83% of the population.

There were 609 households, out of which 43.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 78.8% were married couples living together, 5.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 11.8% were non-families. 8.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.31 and the average family size was 3.51.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 28.5% under the age of 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 22.4% from 25 to 44, 31.2% from 45 to 64, and 6.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.5 males.

<doc id="137056" wikidata="Q129935" url="?curid=137056" title="Herriman, Utah">
<text>Herriman ( ) is a city in southwestern Salt Lake County, Utah. The population was 55,144 as of the 2020 census. Although Herriman was a town in 2000, it has since been classified as a third-class city by state law. The city has experienced rapid growth since incorporation in 1999, as its population was just 1,523 at the 2000 census. It grew from being the 111th-largest incorporated place in Utah in 2000 to the 14th-largest in 2020.

==History==

=== Founding ===
Herriman was established in 1851 by Henry Harriman, Thomas Jefferson Butterfield, John Jay Stocking, and Robert Cowan Petty. A fort was established where the community garden is today. The only remnants of Fort Herriman are two black locust trees that stand near the entry to the old fort.

=== Incorporation ===
Herriman remained a small community until 1999, when concerned citizens went door to door asking people to sign a petition to be incorporated into a town. In 1998 Rose Creek Estates, developed by Watt Homes, started the first &quot;subdivision&quot; with the property under 1 acre. Later, Rosecrest, a land developer who acquired some rights in a large area around Herriman, started large-scale residential development. Rosecrest is owned by parent company Sorenson Companies founded by the late James LeVoy Sorenson. In 2007, Rosecrest won a lawsuit with partner land owners/developers that allowed about to be annexed out of neighboring city Bluffdale into Herriman to further expand the Rosecrest/Herriman housing projects. The lawsuit stemmed from a struggle between Bluffdale city officials, strict city building requirements, and Rosecrest. The addition of Rosecrest greatly increased Herriman&#x27;s population and enabled the town to be turned into a city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 23.1 square miles (59.9 km2), all land. The city frequently annexes new areas west and east of its borders. The newest annexation was in 2022 when the 933-acre Olympia housing development was annexed on the west side of the city.

Herriman shares borders with Riverton to the east, South Jordan to the north, and Bluffdale to the southeast.

== Natural disasters ==

=== Flooding ===
In 2014, the cemetery on Pioneer Street flooded, leaving many graves washed up. The City restored most of the graves and adjusted drainage in to accommodate for future issues.

In 2018, a water line broke on 13400 S., causing flooding to businesses and houses. The main line broke due to a gardening tool hitting the water line.

=== Fires ===
Often, the City experiences fires. In 2018, a youth was playing with smoke bombs in dry grass, resulting in 160 acres burnt and three houses destroyed. The exposed mountains, dry brush, and open fields make Herriman highly susceptible to fires.

==== Machine Gun Fire ====
On September 19, 2010, the National Guard was performing an exercise at Camp Williams, south of Herriman, when a tracer bullet likely struck a rock, setting off a wildfire. Unified Fire Authority members mobilized and were able to arrest the progress of the fire, but not before three homes were destroyed and another damaged. Various small structures were also affected. Over 1,200 homes were evacuated in the face of the oncoming danger, with most of them able to return by Tuesday, September 21, 2010.

==Demographics==
According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2017, there were 39,224 people in Herriman. The racial makeup of the county was 83.3% non-Hispanic White, 2.2% Black, 0.8% Asian, 1.6% Pacific Islander, and 4.4% from two or more races. 8.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

<doc id="137057" wikidata="Q482520" url="?curid=137057" title="Holladay, Utah">
<text>Holladay is a city in central Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area and abuts the Wasatch National Forest. The population was 31,965 at the 2020 census, a significant increase from 14,561 in 2000 when the first area incorporated from Salt Lake County. The city was incorporated on November 29, 1999, as Holladay-Cottonwood, and the name was shortened to Holladay on December 14 of that year. It was reported in the 1990 census as the Holladay-Cottonwood CDP.

==History==

On July 29, 1847, a group of Mormon pioneers (members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) known as the Mississippi Company, among them John Holladay of Alabama, entered the Salt Lake Valley. Within weeks after their arrival, they discovered a free-flowing, spring-fed stream, which they called Spring Creek (near what is now Kentucky Avenue). While most of the group returned to the main settlement in Salt Lake City for the winter, two or three men built dugouts along this stream and wintered over. Thus, this became the first village established away from Salt Lake City itself. In the spring, a number of families hurried out to build homes and tame the land. There were numerous springs and ponds here and grasses and wild flowers were abundant, making this a desirable area for settlement.

When John Holladay was named as the branch president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the village took upon itself the name of Holladay&#x27;s Settlement or Holladay&#x27;s Burgh. John Holladay&#x27;s family dates to the early 18th century in Virginia. His ancestors were signers of the South Carolina Declaration of Independence and fought in the Revolutionary War. He is a cousin to Ben Holladay, The Stagecoach King, who traded with the LDS and ran his Denver-San Francisco stage line through Salt Lake. It is not known if they were in contact. John and his father Daniel, a Revolutionary War veteran, pioneered in Alabama before John&#x27;s conversion to Mormonism. A year before the first LDS migration, in the spring of 1846, he departed west with his extended family joining other converts that made up the Mississippi Company led by John Brown. They had been led to expect to meet the main party on the trail but after going as far as Laramie without a sign of them they went south and wintered at Pueblo, Colorado where they were later joined by the Mormon Battalion sick detachments. They had not gotten the word that Brigham Young&#x27;s departure had been delayed by a year.

Holladay is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in Utah, since Salt Lake City was abandoned for a time in 1857 when Johnston&#x27;s Army occupied the city.

Cottonwood, a nearby settlement, was always associated with &quot;Holladay&#x27;s Burgh,&quot; and the area was first designated &quot;Big Cottonwood,&quot; and later, as one of Salt Lake County&#x27;s unincorporated communities, as &quot;Holladay-Cottonwood&quot;.

Another center of settlement is the area settled in the mid-19th century by Rasmus Knudsen, now known as Knudsen&#x27;s Corner. This area lies in the extreme southeastern corner of the city and is split with neighboring Cottonwood Heights.

In the 1960s the Cottonwood Mall was constructed in Holladay, it being Utah&#x27;s first enclosed shopping mall. The mall was closed down in 2007 after a plan to turn the mall into a European-style outdoor shopping village was announced.

The city was incorporated on November 29, 1999, as Holladay-Cottonwood, and the name was shortened to Holladay on December 14 of that year. Holladay City operated under the &quot;strong mayor&quot; form of government from 1999 until 2003, when the &quot;council-manager&quot; form was adopted. The mayors of Holladay have been Liane Stillman (1999 to 2001), Dennis Larkin (2001 to 2003), Dennis Webb (2003 to 2014) and Robert Dahle (2014 to present). The city&#x27;s first manager was Randy Fitts (2003 to 2016). Members of the City Council have included Edward D.P. Lunt, Sandy Thackeray, Steven Peterson, Jim Palmer, Grant Orton, Daniel Bay Gibbons, Jeffrey Fishman, Hugo Diederich, Lynn Pace and Patricia Pignanelli. Known for its fine old homes, heavily wooded lots, the controlling of commercial development and the preservation of open space have been the chief political issues in Holladay&#x27;s recent history.

Holladay has experienced growth via 4 annexations. Expanded borders attribute to the bulk of Holladay&#x27;s residential growth, the most recent being in 2015. As Holladay shares borders with neighboring cities of Murray, City of Millcreek and Cottonwood Heights, the municipal boundaries are established.

<text>Kearns ( ) is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. Named after Utah&#x27;s U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns, it had a population of 36,723 at the 2020 Census.
This was a 2.8 percent increase over the 2010 figure of 35,731.
Kearns is home to the Utah Olympic Oval, an indoor speed skating oval built for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

==History==
=== World War II ===

Kearns came into existence 1 May 1942 as a World War II United States Army Air Forces training facility known as Kearns Army Air Base (also known as Kearns Center; redesignated: Camp Kearns, 1 January 1944). Before the base was built, the area consisted of dry farms on land reserved for universities and colleges. Construction of the base involved building several hundred buildings. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper. The thousands of soldiers and airmen stationed there temporarily made the base one of the largest cities in the state.

Despite being called an Air Base, it had no runways. On its south border was Municipal Airport No. 2, but this was a small field for solely private aviation. It was proposed in 1941 and completed in 1942 so that Municipal Airport No. 1, which became Salt Lake Air Base, the current Salt Lake City International, 10 miles to the north, could be used by the military. Men who flew to Kearns landed at SLC.

In December 1944, Theron C. Teel, president of the Interstate Flying Service, created the Kearns Flying Club to give lessons and rent small single-engine privately owned planes to men at Kearns Army Air Base.

On 15 August 1946, the Air Force deactivated the base and turned the facility over to the State of Utah. The presence of roads and other infrastructure made the area attractive to developers. Houses and businesses sprang up rapidly on what had just a few years earlier been farmland. A theater for &quot;colored personnel&quot; became part of Kearns Junior High School. A base chapel is now part of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church. The base train station is a day-care center. A cannon that had stood next to the headquarters&#x27; flagpole stood for many years at the corner of 40th West and 54th South. The unrelated Municipal Airport No. 2 is known as South Valley Regional Airport.

=== Post war and turn of the century ===
Kearns, in the mid to late twentieth century, saw rapid growth on the former airbase. The old streets and foundations of buildings built by the military were used as a template for the town, and homes sprang up quickly as Kearns was becoming the first suburb in Salt Lake County. By the 1970s and into the 1980s, suburban development expanded west of the railroad tracks to 5600 West. In the 1990s there were arguments between the residents of Kearns, West Valley City, and West Jordan city over annexation. West Valley City began annexing land west of Kearns and cut the community from future development. West Jordan annexed the Oquirrh Shadows subdivision and the remaining land became the Oquirrh CDP. In the late 1990s West Valley City and West Jordan were having talks to divide what was left of Kearns to divide the community along 5400 south where anything south of the road would belong to West Jordan and anything North would belong to West Valley City. The residents of Kearns raised enough signatures to stop the annexation and leave Kearns&#x27; boundaries as they are today. In 2002, the Winter Olympics brought construction of the Olympic Oval at Oquirrh Park. The Olympic Oval was built on a former running track. The Utah Olympic Oval in Kearns was the venue for long-track speed skating events in the 2002 Winter Olympics. Because of its altitude, which gives it the thinnest air of any such facility in the world, and its unique architecture, which allows for close control of temperature and ice conditions, the Oval saw numerous records set during the games. It remains arguably the fastest ice surface in the world. It is used today as a tourist attraction and a recreation spot. The last major housing area constructed in Kearns was an area between 5600 west and 6200 south.

=== 2005–present ===
In 2015, the township of Kearns voted to incorporate as a metro township, a new form of local government that allowed it to elect a council and mayor. Kearns could have also voted to become a city. The following year five council members were elected from five districts and took office in 2017. In 2019 and 2020, more housing was built around Oquirrh Park and a new Kearns Library was finished in December 2020. Every year in late July and early August, there is a parade in Kearns. In May 2024, Kearns was officially incorporated as a city, as a result of Utah&#x27;s House Bill 35. In 2026, a mayor will be elected for the city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Kearns lies on the western side of the Salt Lake Valley and West Bench. The majority of the city lies on the lake bed of the Provo episode of Lake Bonneville, while all of Kearns lies on the Bonneville lake bed. Kearns borders West Valley City to the north and west, Taylorsville to the east, and West Jordan to the south.

The area where Kearns is situated is on a natural formation called the Kearns-Benion hill, which rises approximately above the valley. The hill runs in a northwest direction from the Jordan River to Bacchus hill in the Oquirrh Mountains.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (usually dry) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Kearns has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Magna ( ) is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. The current population of the city stands at 29,251 according to the 2020 census, a 10.4% increase over 26,505 in 2010.

==History==

===Settlement===
Settlement of the area began in 1851 shortly after pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley. Early farmers settled in 1868 at the base of the northern Oquirrh Mountains and called their community Pleasant Green. By 1900, there were about 20 families in the area. One of the first Pleasant Green farmers was Abraham Coon, who established a livestock ranch and settlement called Coonville in a canyon mouth at about 5400 South now known as Coon Canyon. Coon Creek flows out of Coon Canyon and is one of the major Oquirrh Mountain drainages. Coon Creek flows north and west through Magna to the Great Salt Lake.

The Pleasant Green Cemetery located in the Oquirrh foothills, at about 3500 South, was established in 1883. In 1890, in response to a law requiring all children to receive free public education, the first school was built in the community.

===1900-1960===
In the early 1900s, copper mining activity in the Oquirrhs began transforming the Pleasant Green area from an agricultural hamlet to an industrial community. D.C. Jackling established the Utah Copper Company, which later became Kennecott Copper Corp. In 1906, the company began constructing its Magna Mill. Jackling chose the name &quot;Magna&quot; from the Latin word meaning &quot;great&quot; or &quot;superior&quot;.

Beginning in 1903, Magna saw a large influx of Greek immigrants, primarily prompted by coal mine strikes in Carbon County, Utah and Fresno, California. This group eventually established a thriving Greektown and community. The formation of Magna&#x27;s Greektown coincided with that of the forming of Salt Lake City, happening only about 15 miles to the east.

Boston Consolidated Copper constructed a second mill in the area in 1909. In 1911, the companies merged and the mill was renamed, Arthur Mill. Construction workers lived in a temporary settlement known as Ragtown. Several substantial homes were built in the tent city and later moved to the present community. As the mills began operating, some local farmers traded in their plows for a steady company paycheck and began moving in to work at the mills.

In 1914, Renald Woolley, the Post Master of the township, petitioned to have the Pleasant Green post office changed to Magna because of confusion with other towns such as Pleasant Grove. The petition was accepted and in a meeting above his store, the locals accepted the name of Magna for the town and post office, on October 19, 1915. (see West Valley View, June 9, 1983). By 1909, the Hawthorne School (no longer standing) had been built in the eastern Magna area. In 1908, the Webster School (destroyed by fire and demolished in June 2004) was built at the west end of what is now Main Street. In 1924, the first building of the present Cyprus High School was completed. Over the years, buildings and additions have been constructed on the campus. At the time, commuting to work by automobile was not practical. Few mineworkers had cars and cross valley roads were in marginal condition. Workers lived in the town and walked to the mills. Downtown Magna included churches, saloons, fraternal halls, and stores. Several small neighborhoods, such as Greektown, Japantown, Snaketown, and Little Italy, developed around Main Street. Many early residents were immigrants, primarily from Eastern Europe, but Magna was not a mining town.

In 1914, an Italian woman by the name of Anna Carrone settled here and met coal miner Rocco Polidori. They became a couple and moved to Denver, Colorado and went on to found the meat company Polidori Sausage.

Between 1915 and 1960, the town&#x27;s fortunes fluctuated with the copper industry. During the Great Depression, the mills shut down for a period, and workers were laid off. Around 1940, there was a resurgence as the pending war boosted copper demand. Growth continued after World War II, and throughout the 1960s.

===1960-1980===
By the 1960s, the community was experiencing the first signs of a suburban transition. The Hercules Powder Co., once a small dynamite manufacturing firm had begun producing rocket motors at its Bacchus Works plant, south of the Magna community, named after 1912 founder T.W. Bacchus. The increased jobs were one factor that encouraged subdivision development in the Magna, Kearns, and West Valley City areas.

In 1961, the voters in the Magna Improvement District (now the Magna Water and Sewer District) approved a bond that financed a sewage treatment plant, water storage tanks, pumps, and well development. The improvements created sufficient capacity to serve more than double the population at the time and helped open the way for development. Not only did Magna&#x27;s population begin shifting southward during the 1960s, but also automobile commuting, both to work and shopping, became common. As business activity moved to other areas, Main Street slowly began to deteriorate. Presently, some of the commercial space there is vacant.

During the 1970s, as part of a general west valley suburbanization trend, the community experienced more dramatic growth. Inexpensive land south and east of the historic town center began being developed into moderately priced single-family homes. The new neighborhoods tended to attract middle-income working class couples with younger families. While the community had grown from approximately 8,900 in 1960 to 10,000 in 1970, the population had increased to over 23,000 by 2000. This increase is about double the countywide growth rate.

===1980-present===
The process for Magna to become a township took over 10 years. Growth and development continue to define Magna.

The West Bench plan for the redevelopment of mining land should have a major impact on the future of Magna. Kennecott Land plans major development in the areas immediately surrounding Magna. The area west of Magna along I-80 is currently slated to become one of 2 major &quot;urban centers&quot; for Kennecott Land&#x27;s west bench development plan.

The Historic Main Street underwent a major remodel in 2006. Main Street has also become a popular location for filmmakers. including the Disney corporation, and films such as Disney Channel&#x27;s TV movie, &quot;Dadnapped&quot;, and some of the &quot;Halloweentown&quot; movies filmed on Magna Main Street. A two-part episode (and series finale) of the TV series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk with You&quot;. The popular TV series &quot;Granite Flats&quot; also uses some of the Magna locations in part of the series. Disney&#x27;s series &#x27;Andi Mack&#x27; is also filmed in Magna.

On March 18, 2020, Magna was the site of the epicenter for the 5.7 magnitude earthquake 2020 Salt Lake City Earthquake. The quake was followed by more than 850 aftershocks. The temblor struck at approximately 7:10 am, and was felt strongly across the Wasatch Front. Damage was light, although several historic buildings with unreinforced brick walls suffered damage.

On May 1, 2024, Magna was officially promoted from a metro township to a city, as a result of Utah&#x27;s House Bill 35, passed in February of that year.

==History==

Located in the central part of the Salt Lake Valley, and next to the Jordan River, Midvale was an early target for settlers in Utah. Permanent homes began as early as the 1850s, with one of the earliest homes still preserved today. The population grew quickly in the 1870s thanks to its central location, the use of railroad, and its connection to the mining in Bingham Canyon, the western area of present-day Midvale became an important industrial area for Utah. To support this growth, the eastern area of present-day Midvale provided agriculture and housing.

===Incorporation===

People in the area, presumably, started calling the area Midvale, due to its central location in the valley. In 1909 Midvale officially became a city and in the 1910 census had a population of 1,760.

===Growth===

====Fort Union====

Fort Union, historically Union, was an early settlement area on the eastern edge of present-day Midvale. When Midvale annexed the Fort Union Area, it brought an established housing population. However, it did not just provide the city with a much larger population base, it also brought the city the shops of Fort Union. The shops provide both shopping and office space for Midvale.

====Bingham Junction ====

Bingham Junction, originally known as the Sharon Steel site, is on the western border of Midvale and is roughly 446 acres in size. The area originally started seeing economic development as early as 1871 as a slag site for mining, which operated as such until 1958. Upon testing, it appeared to have large amounts of lead, arsenic and heavy metals, rendering the property unusable. Through mediation, help from the EPA and other parties, the area underwent a major cleanup and restoration project that saw its name removed from the NPL in 2006.

Since Bingham Junction&#x27;s removal from the NPL, the area underwent major changes. It brought about thousands of new households to the city. In connection with the added residential, major corporations moved to the area, where Overstock, CHG, and Savage now use as their headquarters. Also, other major companies have brought their operation to the area, including Marriott, Zagg and IHC. Entertainment followed with the first-ever Top Golf in Utah resides in the Bingham Junction area. As other important shopping centers such as Winco and other dining options. The EPA now considers this a success story and estimates as of 2018 there are 56 on-site businesses with at least 2,646 employees.

Bingham Junction is also home to a stop on the red line, that goes from the western edges of Salt Lake County to the University of Utah, Utah&#x27;s flagship university.

====Jordan Bluffs ====

Following in the success of the Bingham Junction Area, the area known as Jordan Bluffs is beginning the early phase of similar redevelopment. Jordan Bluffs is situated south of Bingham Junction and was originally part of the Sharon Steel slag site. It comprises 351 acres in the south west region of Midvale.

Jordan Bluffs is in the beginning phases of redevelopment, but current proposals could see an additional 3,500 housing units and over 1,000,000 square feet of office space within the next ten years.

== Transportation ==

=== Roadways ===

Midvale operates under a grid system as the rest of Salt Lake County. However, as most cities originally operated under their own grid system, Midvale City was one of the last to transition to the county. I-15 runs down the center of Midvale, with I-215&#x27;s interchange with I-15 meeting in the 7200 and state region in Midvale.

=== Bus ===
The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates a bus system that reaches into the city including a sky service bus route. Bus routes serve nearby light rail stations, multiple commercial districts (including the Shops at Fort Union and the State Street commercial district), office parks, and government offices. The ski bus route operates along the 7200 south corridor.

===Rail===

UTA&#x27;s TRAX light rail system operates two separate rail line routes in Midvale, serving both the Red Line and Blue Line. The city is home to three light rail stations: The Red Line has Bingham Junction, and the Blue Line has Midvale Fort Union and Midvale Center stations.

==Economy==

CHG Healthcare Services, Arctic Circle Restaurants, Veritas Funding, LLC, Sportmans&#x27; Warehouse, Zagg and Overstock.com are headquartered in Midvale.

School Improvement Network, an education consulting company, moved its national headquarters to Midvale in 2011.

<text>Millcreek is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, and part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The population as of the 2020 census was 63,380. Prior to its incorporation on December 28, 2016, Millcreek was a census-designated place (CDP) and township.

==History==
Early settlers of the Millcreek area in 1848 included Mary Fielding Smith (widow of Hyrum Smith) and her children, including Joseph F. Smith. The area remained essentially rural in character until after World War II. As postwar suburban growth spilled south over the Salt Lake City limits, the area was not annexed by the city and remained unincorporated.

By the 1980s, most of the area now in Millcreek was built out and known by various names, including East Mill Creek, Canyon Rim and Mount Olympus. In the 2000 census, the area was divided among four CDPs for statistical purposes, the westernmost of which was designated Millcreek CDP. The population of this CDP was 30,377 at the 2000 census, and had a total area of 4.9 square miles (12.8 km2). Canyon Rim CDP, East Millcreek CDP, and Mount Olympus CDP were consolidated with Millcreek CDP in the 2010 census, doubling its population to 62,139.

Salt Lake County created Millcreek Township in 2002 as an administrative subentity that included the populated CDPs as well as undeveloped Mill Creek Canyon in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest immediately to the east. The township was created to give residents of the area more local control over planning and prevent annexations by neighboring cities.

As other communities south of Salt Lake City were incorporated in the 1990s and 2000s, Millcreek remained as the most populous unincorporated area of Salt Lake County. Residents considered a number of options for their future, including incorporation, which would make it the county&#x27;s fifth-largest city. Amalgamation with neighboring South Salt Lake was also proposed, which would have combined South Salt Lake&#x27;s commercial and industrial base with Millcreek&#x27;s heavily residential character, creating a city of over 80,000.

The incorporation of Millcreek was the subject of a contentious 2012 ballot question, which set the boundaries of the proposed city identical to that of Millcreek Township, and asked voters what form of municipal government should be implemented. The initiative failed with only 40 percent of the vote, leaving Millcreek under the jurisdiction of the Salt Lake County Mayor and Council, as are other unincorporated areas of the county.

The question was put on the ballot again three years later, and Millcreek residents voted for incorporation on November 3, 2015. In the 2016 election, residents voted for a mayor and city council members in advance of incorporation, which was recorded at 9:30 a.m. on December 28, 2016.

A major initiative since incorporation has been planning for a downtown or city center that would tie together Millcreek&#x27;s disparate neighborhoods and provide a focal point and identity for the city. The area around Highland Drive and 3300 South, a central location with an established commercial base, has been designated for this purpose. The area is adjacent to Brickyard Plaza, a shopping center Salt Lake City annexed in 1979 and became surrounded by Millcreek when it incorporated. Millcreek officials saw Brickyard Plaza as an obstacle to creating Millcreek&#x27;s new downtown and sought to overturn the annexation, though it had been uncontested for decades, creating tensions between the two municipalities. The boundary dispute was resolved when Salt Lake City agreed to transfer some property to Millcreek that would allow for a contiguous city center, in exchange for Millcreek giving up any claims to Brickyard Plaza.

==Geography==
Suburban in character, Millcreek is wedged between Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake on the north and Murray and Holladay on the south. Millcreek residents typically identify with Salt Lake City, which is designated by the U.S. Postal Service as the default place name for mailing addresses in the area. Millcreek is a recognized place name for addresses in the ZIP codes 84106, 84107, 84109, 84117, and 84124. The city is organized into four community councils, Canyon Rim, East Mill Creek, Millcreek, and Mount Olympus, roughly corresponding to the former CDPs.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Millcreek has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
According to estimates from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute of the University of Utah, as of 2015, there were 60,119 people in Millcreek. The racial makeup of the county was 83.63% non-Hispanic White, 2.05% Black, 0.89% Native American, 3.82% Asian, 0.86% Pacific Islander, 7.23% Hispanic or Latino of any race, and 1.52% from two or more races.

<text>Murray () is a city situated on the Wasatch Front in the core of Salt Lake Valley in the U.S. state of Utah. Named for territorial governor Eli Murray, the city had a population of 50,637 as of the 2020 United States Census.
Murray shares borders with Taylorsville, Holladay, South Salt Lake, Millcreek and West Jordan, Utah. Once teeming with heavy industry, Murray&#x27;s industry mix has now shifted significantly toward healthcare, retail, and professional, scientific, and technical services. Known for its central location in Salt Lake County, Murray has been called the &quot;Hub of Salt Lake County&quot;. Unlike most of its neighboring communities, Murray operates its own police, fire, power, water, library, and parks and recreation departments and has its own school district. While maintaining many of its own services, Murray has one of the lowest city tax rates in the state.

Thousands of people each year visit Murray City Park for organized sports and its wooded areas. Murray is home to the Intermountain Medical Center, a medical campus that is also Murray&#x27;s largest employer. Murray has been designated a Tree City USA since 1977.

== History ==

=== Pre-settlement ===
Before being permanently settled by Mormon pioneers in 1848, the area where Murray is located was a natural area that served as the seasonal home of Paiute, Shoshone, and Bannock Native American tribes. The tribes camped along local creek banks and stream beds during their migrations. Artifacts of Native American encampments have been located along the Jordan River, including camps near Willow Pond Park.

At what was known as the &quot;big bend&quot; of the Jordan River (near 4984 South 700 West Street), the Goshute Indians from Skull Valley made their camp. This was made every spring on the way to their hunting ground at the headwaters of the Bear River. On their return in the fall, they also stayed for a week and traded with white settlers. Early settlers recorded that they generally traded buffalo robes, deer skins, dried meat and tallow.

=== A new settlement ===
Mormon pioneers came into the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. A pioneer group that was called the Mississippi Saints arrived one year later and began to develop a scattered settlement in the south end of the valley that fall. The area was distinguished by various names, such as the Mississippi Ward, Cottonwood, Big Cottonwood and South Cottonwood. Written history states that at least 20 families were living in the South Cottonwood area in the 1860s.

When the first pioneer families settled in the South Cottonwood area in the fall of 1848, they selected the low or bottom lands along the streams of Little Cottonwood Creek and Big Cottonwood Creek. They found an abundance of grass for their cattle and horses there. It was easy to take the water from the streams for irrigation of farm crops. The higher bench lands were covered with sagebrush and produced very little grass. Because of the labor and difficulty in getting water to them, they were left, for later settlement.

There was a strip of high bench land, completely surrounded by low land north of what is now Vine Street and 5600 South Street. Before and after the advent of the pioneers, this land was used by the Ute Indians as a camping ground. This is because water and grass could be obtained on either side of it and enemies could not approach without being seen long before coming to the high ground. This area would become the present-day Murray City Cemetery. The early settlers mutually agreed that no individual should fence or take title to it, but that it should be set aside and considered as belonging to South Cottonwood Ward.

In 1853, when teamsters commenced to haul granite rock from Little Cottonwood Canyon to the Salt Lake Temple construction site, a dirt path was made along what is now Vine Street. The east side of the road (at the northeast corner, where the Stillwater Apartments now stand) became a halfway camping ground for the teamsters. The first building in the Salt Lake Valley outside of Salt Lake City erected for the purpose of religious and educational instruction was built on present-day Gordon Lane, and is commemorated with a monument from the Sons of the Utah Pioneers.
In 1858, during the so-called Utah War, Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s army of the Utah Expedition passed through western Murray after camping on the &quot;flats&quot; above the North Jordan farms. Its large livestock herd reportedly ate everything to within an inch of the ground. General Johnston, who was crossing James Winchester&#x27;s property (now Murray Parkway Golf Course), advised Winchester to pursue a homestead patent. In 1870 James Winchester entered the first homestead of the entire Intermountain West.

The Pony Express traveled through central Murray, along what is now State Street. The Utah Pony Express Station Number 9 was located near present-day 6200 State Street and was called &quot;Travelers&#x27; Rest&quot;, but the accommodations were meager, consisting of a stable and one-room bunk house. The Overland Stagecoach later made use of Travelers&#x27; Rest during its period of operation. The Sons of Utah Pioneers erected a monument at 7200 State Street in Midvale commemorating the station.

The area remained agricultural until 1869 when a body of ore was found in Park City, Utah, and additional ore deposits were found in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Because of Murray&#x27;s central location and access to the railroad, the first smelter was built there in 1870 and over the next 30 years Murray became home to some of the largest smelters of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc in the region.

The first official post office was established in 1870 as the South Cottonwood Post Office. The area changed over time as the railroad came in, smelting expanded, the territorial road (later known as State Street) was established, and trolley transportation was developed. A business district also began to develop along the transportation corridor. (See also Murray Downtown Historic District and Murray Downtown Residential Historic District.)

The army established Camp Murray in 1885 to house several companies of the Ninth Infantry Regiment. The army camp was meant to help protect the railroad and provide training. The short-lived camp&#x27;s most notable action was when General Alexander McDowell McCook and six divisions of the camp were ordered to escort Chinese nationals out of Evanston, Wyoming, due to the race riots that were happening among miners in Rock Springs, Wyoming. The camp was disbanded in the early 20th century.

The city received its present name from the post office, which had officially changed its name from South Cottonwood Post Office to Murray Post Office in 1883, after the Civil War general, Eli Murray, territorial governor of Utah from 1880 to 1886.

After a riot and fire were started by a rowdy group of smelter workers in a local saloon, a local newspaper editor began agitating for the settlement to be incorporated. The final incorporation committee drafted a petition in 1901 and created an intense campaign on both sides of the incorporation battle. An incorporation election was held on November 18, 1902. Those in favor won, and C.L. Miller was elected Mayor by a margin of three votes. Salt Lake County recognized the election results as official on November 25, 1902, and the city was officially recognized as a Third Class City by the State of Utah on January 3, 1903.

=== Center of industry ===

Murray&#x27;s central location in Salt Lake Valley made it a convenient location for industry. Construction of the Woodhill Brothers&#x27; smelter in 1869 initiated Murray&#x27;s industrial history. In 1870, Murray produced the first silver bars smelted in Utah. In 1899, American Smelting &amp; Refining Company (ASARCO) was organized by combining the Germania and Hanauer smelters. The smelters continued to dominate the local economy until the close of the ASARCO lead smelter in 1949. Business and commercial enterprise prospered along with the smelter industry. Murray&#x27;s industry would later include a water plant, lighting system, canning factory, flour mills, and brickyards. Many of those employed at the Franklyn and Germania smelters were immigrants from Scandinavian countries who had joined the LDS church in their homeland and moved to Utah; most spoke little English. The Scandinavian population settled in the area west of State Street and was large enough to hold separate LDS services in the Swedish language. (See Murray LDS Second Ward Meetinghouse). The Scandinavians eventually dispersed, and with the exception of their meetinghouse, few ethnic reminders remain in this section of Murray. Joe Hill, the Industrial Workers of the World labor activist came to Murray in 1914 to rally laborers working at the smelters and nearby mines. He was arrested for a double homicide in Salt Lake City while recovering from a gunshot wound at the Murray home of Edward and John Eselius, that was located on 4800 South (then known as 17th South St.) and Plum Street.

&quot;Bergertown&quot;, a cluster of homes south of 4800 South Street on Little Cottonwood Creek, was settled by Swiss immigrant Christian Berger prior to the town&#x27;s industrialization. Simple small two-room frame houses without paint and running water characterized this side of town. Bergertown quickly became an immigrant enclave, as the population were mainly employees of the smelters. A few original homes remain among modern retail establishments.

In addition to the impact of lawsuits due to the spread of lead dust, Murray&#x27;s industry suffered greatly in the 1930s depression. The smelters began to close in 1931, and major industry had nearly vanished by 1940. By the 1950s the industry was completely gone. Murray was quick to take advantage of various federal projects to compensate for this economic loss. In 2000, to avoid designation as a Superfund site, the landmark ASARCO Smelters were imploded, and Intermountain Healthcare purchased the site for its Intermountain Medical Center. As landmarks, the smelters are remembered in Murray&#x27;s logos and trademarks.

=== Post–World War II to present ===
With the demise of heavy industry prior to World War II, and the advent of the Interstate Freeway System in the 1950s, Murray became a major retail hub due to its central location. State Street is dominated by automobile dealerships, where auto magnate, Larry H. Miller, purchased his first dealership May 1, 1979, as Larry H. Miller Toyota.

Fashion Place Mall was constructed in the 1970s. It is now a major mercantile center which saw major renovation and expansion in the first decade of the 21st century. The mall achieved some fame after serial killer Ted Bundy&#x27;s murder spree temporarily came to an end when he tried to lure Carol DaRonch into his car at the mall on November 8, 1974. DaRonch fought Bundy, escaped from his car, and survived to testify against him in court.

Cottonwood Hospital opened in the 1960s, receiving numerous recognitions. Replaced by Intermountain Medical Center (IMC) in 2007, it spawned The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital (TOSH) in the 1990s.

As part of the construction of the Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s (UTA) TRAX light-rail line in the 1990s, three stations were built in Murray along the primary route (for both the Blue Line and Red Line). The Fireclay Housing Project received national recognition for its use of creating development around the Murray North station as a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). Murray&#x27;s Fashion Place West station is the junction for the Red Line (Mid-Jordan Line) light-rail spur. In 2012 &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail service was extended to Murray Central station.

In the mid-2000s, people of the census-designated place (CDP), Cottonwood West, petitioned for annexation into Murray, increasing the population by 17,000, nearly one-third more than in the 2000 census. Murray&#x27;s eastern boundary, along 900 East, was extended as a result of the annexation to Van Winkle Expressway and Highland Drive, along the city borders of Holladay and Cottonwood Heights.

== Government ==
Incorporated on January 3, 1903, Murray initially created a Mayor-Council form of government. A 1911 State law changed the form of government for cities of the First and Second Class in Utah from the old Council form to the Commission form of government. This form of government was reversed in 1981. The City adopted the &quot;Strong Mayor&quot;-Council form of government, which included an elected Mayor and five City Council members. To ensure staggered terms of the council, an election is held every two years for half the Council members for four-year terms. The city provides for most of its own services, including Police, Fire, Power, Water, Sewer, Library, Senior Center, and Parks and Recreation. George Huscher was mayor of Murray during 1912–1915, and was the first (and to date only) Socialist elected to a major office in Utah. Murray&#x27;s citywide elections are now non-partisan races.

Murray is located in Utah&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which is represented by Burgess Owens.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.6 square miles (24.9 km), all land. Murray is located in the heart of the Salt Lake Valley. The city is nearly built out with a broad mix of commercial, residential and industrial uses. The topography is generally gentle, sloping westward from the nearby Wasatch Mountain Range toward the Jordan River, which is the terminal river feature in the Salt Lake Valley. Murray&#x27;s average altitude is approximately 1300 meters Above Sea Level, with the highest variation located near the border of Cottonwood Heights and lowest variation along the Jordan River near 4500 South Street.

Lying at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, and located approximately three miles to the east of Murray, in neighboring Holladay, is the Wasatch Fault. Liquefaction is a particular danger to Murray because of the close proximity of the Wasatch fault. Soil liquefaction potential, according to the Utah Geological Survey, estimates that the majority of Murray is in either High or Moderate Liquefaction zones. City policies are in place to minimize the potential impacts on structures.
=== Hydrology ===
The Jordan River is the largest water feature within Murray. It traverses the western edge of Murray, where it eventually reaches the Great Salt Lake. Murray administers a trail and green area that borders the river through the whole city. Big Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood Creeks join the Jordan River within Murray boundaries, following routes between properties, along streets, and through parks and open spaces. Significant wetlands adjoin the river and these two creeks.

Murray contains only small lakes. Willow Pond and Turner Pond are the largest natural lakes within the city limits. Willow Pond is the only lake that permits public access, and is stocked with fish. Several man-made lakes have been created in the &quot;Lynn Pett Murray Parkway&quot; and &quot;Mick Riley Golf Courses&quot;. Other lakes are small and are contained within Murray&#x27;s wetland areas.

=== Climate ===

Murray has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;).

== Education ==

=== Primary and secondary schools ===
The Murray City School District was created on January 1, 1906. It has ten schools: seven elementary, two middle schools, (Riverview and Hillcrest), and one senior high school (Murray). An alternative high school, (Creekside) was closed in 2006. Murray High School is a 4-A school in Utah&#x27;s 5 Division high school sports leagues (1A being the smallest; 5A the largest). It was used in the &quot;High School Musical&quot; movie series for the Walt Disney Company.

The Granite School District operates Cottonwood High School and Woodstock Elementary School within the Murray boundaries.

=== Higher education ===
Several private colleges have campuses in Murray: University of Phoenix, Stevens-Henager College, and Eagle Gate College.

== Parks and recreation ==

Murray took advantage of various federal projects during the Great Depression to develop its Park System. The city actively sought federal money to refurbish its 22-acre Murray City Park and buildings and to purchase an additional twelve acres of fairgrounds. By 1939, Murray was the site of the annual Salt Lake County Fair. The county fair relocated from Murray Park, and the Fair buildings were replaced by a community recreation facility called the Park Center, with indoor swimming pools, indoor track, exercise facilities and gymnasium. Murray Park&#x27;s Ken Price Ball Park hosted the 2009 Babe Ruth League World Series and the 2012 Babe Ruth League World Series. Murray Park is adjacent to the Salt Lake County Ice Center that was utilized as a practice venue during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.

There are several neighborhood parks, as well as the substantial Jordan River Parkway; a park system of natural trails along the Jordan River that includes pedestrian and equestrian trails, picnic areas, and canoe launches. The trails connect several significant city parks of Winchester, Walden Park, Germania Park, and Arrowhead. The parkway also has The Kennecott Nature Center, an environmental education center that is utilized by school districts.

Wheeler Historic Farm is located in Murray. Operated by Salt Lake County, the farm is a restoration of Henry J. Wheeler&#x27;s turn-of-the-20th-century dairy farm. The farm presents to the public the history of Utah family agriculture and rural lifestyle from 1890 to 1920, and gives historic demonstrations and exhibits.

USA Hockey hosts an adult league that utilizes the facility. Youth and beginner hockey lessons are offered.

=== Rugby ===
The Murray Park Rugby Stadium has hosted USA Rugby&#x27;s national high school championships. The Highland Rugby club, one of the most nationally successful high school rugby programs, is based there. Utah Rugby Football Union, an affiliate of the Pacific Coast Rugby Football Union, sanctions most semi-professional, adult, collegiate, and high school clubs that use the field.

In June 2012 this stadium hosted the 2012 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy.

=== Baseball ===
In 1914, Murray had its own professional baseball team called the Murray Infants which was part of the Union Association league. The team was managed by Cliff Blankenship, a former Cincinnati Reds and Washington Senators player. Notable players include Ike Caveney who was called up to play in the Cincinnati Reds and Mickey Shader that later managed a team in the Reds baseball farm system. The team folded in 1914 with the collapse of the league.

In August 2009, Murray hosted its first 13-Year-Old Babe Ruth League World Series. All World Series games were played at the 3000-seat Ken Price Ball Park, home field to Murray High School baseball team and next to Murray City Park. Adult, high school and youth leagues use the facility that is sanctioned by the Murray City Parks and Recreation department. Murray hosted the 14-Year-Old Babe Ruth League World Series in 2012.

=== Basketball ===
When the Utah Jazz first located to Utah in 1979, the Sports Mall fitness center was reserved as a practice facility for visiting teams including notable players Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The Jazz later constructed its own practice center.

Utah Jazz players hold basketball clinics and camps for youth at the Murray Park Center. Murray&#x27;s adult and youth basketball leagues are sanctioned by the Murray City Parks and Recreation department.
=== Soccer ===
Murray was one of three final candidates to be the home of the Real Salt Lake soccer team. The stadium was awarded to Sandy, Utah. Sanctioned by the Murray Parks and Recreation department, adult and youth leagues play on the numerous soccer fields. The department also has a small soccer stadium located in Willow Pond Park. The US Youth Soccer Association sanctions games that are played there.

=== Golf ===
The Murray Parkway Golf Course has been rated among the top 25 golf courses in Utah. It has hosted events for the Utah State Amateur Championship of the Utah Golf Association. Mick Riley Golf Course also has hosted Utah State Amateur events.

=== Boxing ===
While Murray no longer has a boxing venue, it did host a number of championship fights in the early part of the 20th century. Most notable was boxing legend Jack Dempsey&#x27;s only defeat, due to a knockout, at the Murray Fire Hall (4735 South State Street). Dempsey was knocked out by Fireman Jim Flynn on February 13, 1917, and many speculated that Dempsey may have thrown the fight as he was knocked out in the first round, but witnesses stated he was on the mat for at least 20 seconds. One year earlier, Dempsey defeated the
boxer, Young Hector who retired from the fight at the same location.

Murray hosted the 1913 welterweight tournament for the western United States. Ernest &quot;Cyclone&quot; Wright won the Welterweight championship of the western states. He was also a member of Murray&#x27;s first volunteer fire department.

== Library ==

Murray City Library was established on January 6, 1911, and started as one of the Carnegie libraries. Murray later created an additional small library in 1965 on Valley Drive. In 1992, Murray consolidated its two libraries into a new center on 5300 South that would permit it to have more books and include study space and conference rooms. The new library was further renovated in 2008, increasing public computers and Wi-Fi access throughout the building. The historic Carnegie library on Vine Street was demolished in 2020 to make way for new development. Murray&#x27;s library is independent from the Salt Lake County and Salt Lake City library systems. However, there is a reciprocal borrowing agreement between all three entities.

Murray City Library offers activities for all ages, including book clubs, story times, chess clubs and afterschool activities for grade-school children and teenagers. The physical, in-building collection has grown to include books, DVDs, CDs, audiobooks, tablets, Wi-Fi hotspots, and a telescope. The online collection includes downloadable books, audiobooks, magazines, music, and movies. In 2023, Murray City Library partnered with Murray City Parks and Recreation to create the Tale Trail, an outdoor reading experience for children and their families.

== Arts and culture ==

Murray is home to several professional and amateur performing-arts groups, notably, the Desert Star Playhouse, located in the historic Iris Theatre which is noted for its community-based plays and melodramas. The historic Murray Theatre hosts a variety of performing acts, primarily musical, throughout the year, and has hosted screenings for the Slamdance Film Festival. The city-sponsored Murray Park Amphitheatre produces plays in the outdoor setting of Murray Park during the summer.

The Murray Symphony Orchestra (MSO) is a community-based orchestra of professional and amateur musicians. The MSO is volunteer-based and receives funding from Murray and Salt Lake County. MSO also features jazz and string combos.

The Ballet Centre in Murray features ballet performances, with training for children and adults. The Murray Arts Centre features ballroom dancing in addition to modern styles of dance on a daily basis, and has live big band and jazz combo accompaniment.

The Murray City Cultural Arts program was created in 1992 under the Parks and Recreation Department. Together, the Arts Advisory Board and the Cultural Programs Office have created year-round cultural activities including arts-in-education projects, workshops and camps, musicals, visual art exhibits and competitions involving over 5000 youth and adults annually. A summer and winter season, created together with local performing arts organizations, have been successfully operating since 1990. Murray Arts in the Park entertains over 13,000 patrons each summer.

=== Historic architecture ===

Murray has several buildings and districts listed on the National Park Service&#x27;s National Historic Register:
*Murray Downtown Historic District
*Murray Downtown Residential Historic District
*Wheeler Farm
*Murray Theater
*Desert Star Theater
*John P. Cahoon House (Murray Mansion)
*Murray LDS Second Ward Meetinghouse
*Warenski-Duvall Commercial Building and Apartments

== Demographics ==
According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2020, there were 50,637 people in Murray. The racial makeup of the city was 78.7% White, 2.3% Black, 1% Native American, 3.4% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander, 4.6% Other Race, and 9.3% from two or more races. 13.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===

Southern Murray contains the major interchange between Interstate 15, a ten-lane north–south freeway that divides Murray centrally, and Interstate 215, an auxiliary eight-lane freeway that roughly follows the southern boundary of the city. Interstate 15 provides two interchanges inside city limits at 4500 South (SR-266) and 5300 South (SR-173). Interstate 215 provides two interchanges at State Street (US-89) and Union Park Boulevard. State Street runs through central Murray through the Murray Downtown Historic District and passes by the main retail centers at 5300 South and the Fashion Place Mall. Van Winkle Expressway (SR-152) is a four-lane road that forms the eastern boundary of Murray, while 4500 South traverses the northern part of Murray and extends the length of Salt Lake Valley. 5400 South enters western Murray and then shifts northward one block to become 5300 South, which bears the honorary designation of Spartan Boulevard from Woodrow Street to State Street.

=== Rail ===

Historically, the railroad was vital to the development of Murray. In 1870 the railroad line was extended southward through Murray and was called the Utah Southern. The Rio Grande Western (RGW) railway came in the fall of 1881 and purchased the Alta lines which had been built earlier. RGW merged to form the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad which later created a depot in Murray. The Utah Northern Railway developed a key terminus in the late 19th century that connected mining operations from Park City and Bingham, and Murray&#x27;s industrial complex developed along that rail line. Utah Northern Railway and Oregon Short Line Railroad merged and were later acquired by Union Pacific Railroad.

Downtown Murray was accessible by trolley car, operated by the Utah Light and Railway, at the beginning of the 20th century. The trolley ran along State Street from downtown Salt Lake City to Murray. E.H. Harriman, president of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads, purchased Utah Light and Railway and continued its operation until the 1920s.

=== Public transit ===
Murray is served by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) bus system. Two lines of UTA&#x27;s TRAX light rail serve Murray. The Blue Line connects Murray with Downtown Salt Lake City and Draper, while the Red Line connects with the University of Utah and the Daybreak Community in South Jordan. Both the Blue and Red Lines connect further north with the Green Line which provides service to West Valley City and the Salt Lake City International Airport (via Downtown Salt Lake City). Murray&#x27;s section of TRAX has three stations: Murray North station located on Fireclay Ave (4300 South), Murray Central station at 5200 South, and Fashion Place West station. UTA&#x27;s &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail opened for service in December 2012, extending &quot;Frontrunner&quot; from Pleasant View (on the north) south to Provo. Murray station is the only station outside of Salt Lake City where both &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and TRAX connect.

== Infrastructure ==
Electric power came into Murray in 1905, with the Progress Electric Company; they strung enough wire to light over a hundred street lights in the city, and a few buildings. City residents and businesses soon clamored for more electricity, which Progress Electric didn&#x27;t have the capacity to deliver. The City commissioners decided to acquire the system and improve upon delivering power to more people. On July 9, 1912, the city commission approved a resolution to create a municipally-owned power company. That same resolution also created a municipally-owned water and sewage system. Murray generates much of its electricity from natural gas, coal, and water turbines. Murray was one of the first communities in Utah to receive power from methane generated in its landfill. Methane electricity generation fulfills 3 percent of Murray&#x27;s needs but it is estimated that it can cover up to 13 percent.

Murray Public Services operates its water, sewer, and garbage and recycling program. Some areas of the city are serviced by the Salt Lake Valley Water Conservancy District and Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District.

<text>Riverton is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The population was 45,285 as of the 2020 census. Riverton is located in the rapidly growing southwestern corner of the Salt Lake Valley.

==History==

Located in the southern end of Salt Lake Valley, the first people of European descent to live in the area that is now Riverton settled in the mid-1850s. These early settlers scattered widely along the river bottom in crude dugout homes. Although the early accounts disagree, Archibald Gardner may have been the first to settle Riverton land. The town was originally referred to as “Gardnerville” prior to changing its name to Riverton. Riverton&#x27;s initial growth was slow because of the lack of water for irrigation. When more water became available, the town began to grow. Eventually three canals were built to extend water from the nearby Jordan River to the benchland areas, providing irrigation for agricultural uses to the larger area.

By the beginning of World War I in 1914, with its additional irrigation water and influx of people, Riverton prospered as an agricultural community. Its thriving business district was also evident at this time.

=== Commercial development history ===

The Page-Pixon store was built around the start of the 20th century, west of Redwood Road at 12760 South. The large department store sold everything from building materials, coal and dry goods to groceries, grain and housewares. This building was set back off the road and had a tie rail in front of it for tying up horses.

The Jordan Valley Bank was started in 1905 as a community bank. This bank was first housed in the Page-Hansen Store then the Commercial Building. In 1920 it moved across the street, to the south. Other businesses coming to Riverton in the ten-year period before and after the First World War included Bill&#x27;s Meat Market, Gilbert Lloyd&#x27;s Blacksmith Shop, Riverton Motors, the Riverton, Utah Canning Factory, the Riverton Alfalfa Mill, Utah Poultry Company and numerous others ranging from theaters to mercantile stores.

Farming was also a major Riverton business. Just before the turn of the century, the farmers in Riverton gradually began to change from self-sufficient farming to commercial farming. In its early years Riverton&#x27;s farmers were mostly self-sufficient, producing almost everything they needed. This was no longer the case when farming became a business. Riverton farmers were becoming specialists concentrating mostly on alfalfa, wheat, sugar beets, tomatoes, poultry, sheep or dairy cows. At this time, on land purchased from Samuel Howard in 1886, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began to store tithed produce and livestock. It was not long until the hill that this enterprise was located on, at 1150 West 12400 South, became known as Tithing Yard Hill, which is now a residential planned development under the same name.

Electricity first came to Riverton in 1912. In 1913 the Salt Lake and Utah Railroad (Orem Line) was started and went through Riverton west of Redwood Road. It was used as a commuter and freight line and stretched from Salt Lake to Payson in Utah County. Trains used this line from 1914 to 1945 after which the rails and ties were removed. Riverton had its own train depot which was also torn down when the line was closed.

=== Educational development history ===

The community&#x27;s first school had only one room. It was located in the old adobe meetinghouse used by the LDS branch on 1300 West. In 1892, a new two-story brick schoolhouse was built at 12830 South on Redwood Road. This structure had four rooms, two upstairs and two down and was built in January 1893. It was used by grades one through eight, two grades to a classroom. John Hansen was the first principal of this school. As the population grew additional classrooms were needed and another building for elementary grades was erected to the north of the four-room schoolhouse. In 1925 the south building was torn down and the north building remodeled. However, before the remodeling was completed, a fire struck-completely destroying the school on July 30, 1926. A junior high continued to be built on the south lot and the new elementary school which matched the junior high in brick color and design was erected on the site of the fire-destroyed building. Both these structures eventually became the Riverton Elementary School complex. The increased population of the 1970s and 1980s necessitated the construction of two new Riverton elementary schools. Southland Elementary was built on 2700 West and 12675 South and Rosamond Elementary at 1975 West and 12195 South.

By 1948 Riverton had grown sufficiently to be incorporated into a city. However, the city&#x27;s progress was temporarily halted by World War II, the final stage of the farming community&#x27;s evolution occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. Land prices skyrocketed and Riverton&#x27;s subdivisions expanded. Farmers sold land at prices many times the price they paid for it. Land was out of reach for your farmers, many of whom moved to Idaho and other neighboring states. This was mirrored throughout Salt Lake county as the number of farms decreased from 2,595 in 1950 to 798 in 1969. Nevertheless, Riverton&#x27;s population more than tripled between 1970 when it totaled 2,820 inhabitants, and the mid-1980s when it reached around 10,000.

=== Community development history ===

During this time a new City Hall was constructed at the edge of the Riverton City Park at 12800 South and 1400 West. In 1996 the city purchased the old Riverton Elementary School and its surrounding of land from the Jordan School District for $225,000. The city initially put a ballot measure out to fund the school through a general revenue bond, but the measure failed to gain support because it would have raised property taxes for residents of Riverton. Instead the city put together a multi-year plan to convert the old school house to the Riverton Community Center, and some of the land was sold to the County Library System for a new, state of the art library. By 2005–06, the city had successfully renovated the old elementary School into a new Community Center and City Hall, which now houses all of the city&#x27;s administrative offices.

The often contentious city boundaries were in flux between the time of incorporation until the year 2000. At incorporation the boundaries were set from the Jordan River westward to what is now known as the coordinates of 3600 West, and from 11800 South to approximately 13800 South. In 1970, the town of Bluffdale was incorporated, taking in all of the land between 13800 South, southward to the Salt Lake/Utah County Line. 1982 saw the incorporation of the city of Draper, a town once situated at the south-east end of the Salt Lake Valley, their incorporated boundaries, uncontested by Riverton, took area all of the area eastward from the Jordan River to the I-15 freeway, an area that was once &quot;loosely&quot; considered or referred to as Riverton or &quot;Riverton Siding.&quot; In 1996 the city boundaries grew, virtually doubling the physical size of the city, through the annexation of land between Riverton and what was then known as the town of Herriman (now an incorporated city), extending its boundaries from 3600 West to roughly 4800 West, and to 5600 West from 13400 South to 14200 South and points southward beyond the city limits of Bluffdale. Included in the 1996 annexation was the “Foothills” development which had previously been annexed into Riverton during the 1980s, and then later de-annexed after the original developer filed for bankruptcy. The final solidification of Riverton&#x27;s boundaries came when the city of Herriman incorporated in 2000, halting any possible further expansion westward by Riverton.

==Geography==
Riverton shares city borders with South Jordan to the north, Draper to the east, Bluffdale to the south, and Herriman to the west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city is located in the southwestern corner of the Salt Lake Valley about south and slightly west of Salt Lake City. Riverton receives an average of in precipitation each year. Snow can be seen in the winter, while during the summer temperatures occasionally break . Riverton has grown rapidly in the last few years, transforming it from a rural farming town into a suburban city.

==Governance==

Riverton City is a city of the 3rd class as defined by Utah Code. Riverton City operates under a “six-member council&quot; form of government, which means there are six elected officials that make up the governing body: a mayor and five council members. Riverton&#x27;s council members each represent a distinct geographical district and the mayor represents the city at large.

The city council has delegated the operational and day-to-day responsibilities of managing the city, its employees and services to a professional, full-time city manager. The city manager oversees all city departments and reports directly to the mayor and city council.

==Education==

Public education in Riverton is provided by the Jordan School District, one of the largest school districts in Utah.

Elementary Schools: Foothills Elementary, Midas Creek Elementary, Riverton Elementary, Rosamond Elementary, Rose Creek Elementary, Southland Elementary

Middle Schools: Oquirrh Hills Middle School, South Hills Middle School

High School: Riverton High School

Kauri Sue Hamilton School for students with special needs, Jordan Academy for Technology and Careers (JATC) south campus, and Saint Andrew Catholic School are also located in the community.

Many students from Riverton attend schools in Bluffdale, Herriman and South Jordan, as school boundaries do not coincide with city boundaries.

==Hospital==
The Intermountain Riverton Hospital, funded and operated by Intermountain Health, opened in November 2009. The hospital serves the fastest growing portion of the Salt Lake Valley with surrounding cities of Riverton, Herriman, Bluffdale, and South Jordan. The hospital also provides services to cities in northern Utah County. Services include a complete in-and-out patient care center, a 24-hour emergency department, a state-of-art-women&#x27;s center, a surgical center, radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, physical therapy, 40 physician offices, and a helicopter pad. Perhaps the most notable service the hospital features is the children&#x27;s out-patient center run by Primary Children&#x27;s Medical Center. The design of the hospital allows it to expand as the southwest part of the valley continues to see rapid growth.

==Transportation==
Riverton provides easy-access to Bangerter Highway, Mountain View Corridor, and Redwood Road; as all pass directly through the city. The city is also easily accessible from Interstate 15 via the 12300 S or Bangerter Highway exits.

==Demographics==

According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as July 1, 2019, there were 44,419 people in Riverton. The racial makeup of the county was 90.3% non-Hispanic White, 0.4% Black, 0.2% Native American, 1.0% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander, and 1.3% from two or more races. 6.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

<text>Sandy is a city in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, located in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. The population was 96,904 according to the 2020 United States census.

Sandy is home to the Shops at South Town shopping mall; the Jordan Commons entertainment, office and dining complex; and the Mountain America Exposition Center. It is also the location of the soccer-specific America First Field (formerly known as Rio Tinto Stadium), which hosts Real Salt Lake and Utah Royals FC home games, and opened on October 8, 2008.

The city is currently developing a walkable and transit-oriented city center called The Cairns. A formal master plan was adopted in January 2017 to accommodate regional growth and outlines developments and related guidelines through the next 25 years, while dividing the city center into distinct villages. The plan emphasizes sustainable living, walkability, human-scaled architecture, environmentally-friendly design, and nature-inspired design while managing population growth and its related challenges.

==History==


=== Early settlements ===
Located at the base of the Wasatch Mountains south of Salt Lake City, Sandy was a likely area for early settlement. The area was first used by nomadic bands of Paiute, Shoshone, and Bannock Indians who roamed along the base of the mountains as they travelled from their winter home at Utah Lake to their summer fishing grounds at Bear Lake.

Permanent settlers first moved into Sandy during the 1860s and 1870s because of the availability of land in the less crowded southern end of the Salt Lake Valley. The original plat was essentially one square mile, situated on an alluvial terrace running north and south along the eastern edge of the Jordan River drainage system and paralleling the mountain range.

The origin of its name has not been established with any certainty. Perhaps most widely believed is that Brigham Young named Sandy for its thirsty soil, but there is no historical evidence for this. Another theory is that the name came from a legendary and colorful Scotsman, Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Kinghorn, the engineer who ran the first train line to this end of the Salt Lake Valley. Though this seems bolstered by the original name (Sandy Station or Sandy&#x27;s Station), historians consider it unlikely in view of the short period between the start of the train service and the first instances of the name.

In 1863, there were only four homes between Union (7200 South) and Dunyon (Point of the Mountain): the Thayne homestead at 6600 South and 800 East, one in Crescent, one at Dunyon, and a fourth outside present-day Sandy boundaries altogether. Within a few years, Thomas Allsop, a Yorkshire farmer who had immigrated to Utah in 1853, owned almost half of present-day Sandy from County Road to Fourth East along Alta Road to Lindell Parkway. LeGrand Young owned the land between Fourth East and State Street.

Farmers willing to try their hand at the thirsty soil that inspired Sandy&#x27;s name took up land along State Street, which stretched from downtown Salt Lake City to Point of the Mountain. But it was mining that shaped Sandy&#x27;s first four decades. When silver mining began in Little Cottonwood Canyon, entrepreneurs recognized Sandy&#x27;s value as a supply station; soon its main street was lined with hotels, saloons, and brothels serving miners ready to spend their newly earned wages. Three major smelters were located in Sandy. They were the Flagstaff, the Mingo, and the Saturn. These made Sandy the territory&#x27;s most significant smelting center for a number of years.

The railroad was also significant in determining the course of Sandy&#x27;s history. Built in 1873, the railroad connected Sandy to Salt Lake City and facilitated the transportation of ore and other products both in and out of the area. A streetcar line in 1907 facilitated the transportation of locals to jobs in Salt Lake City; and the automobile later continued to serve that function.

===Incorporation===
Sandy was incorporated in 1893, largely as part of an effort to combat what Mormon inhabitants considered &quot;unsavory&quot; elements in the town. Due to its mine-based beginnings, Sandy saw some modest growth. After incorporation, it was almost as if Sandy had redefined itself. Gone were the large numbers of single, transient men. By 1900, there was only a handful of saloons and hotels, and Sandy began to more closely resemble other rural Utah towns — a place where everyone knew everyone else. Church, farming, business, and family formed the focus of the inhabitants&#x27; world.

In the late 1960s, however, this rural town dramatically changed course with its second boom. It had always been assumed by local leaders and citizens that Sandy would grow outward from its logical and historic center—the nexus of Main and Center streets. However, population growth overwhelmed the physical center as neighborhoods spread out in every direction over the land.

During the 1970s, pocket communities took shape, providing the services, schools, and shopping traditionally offered by a city. Annexation issues became prominent as Salt Lake County and Sandy vied for control over land and resources. Sandy became a collection of small local communities identified by a youthful, family-oriented population. Although it was initially perceived as a bedroom community, and often still is, it has since developed a thriving commercial center along State Street and other various arterial roads.

=== The Cairns ===

In 2014, the Sandy City government revealed blueprints to redevelop 1,100 acres of Sandy&#x27;s downtown area into a new resort-style city center over the next 25 years, adding high-rise multi-family residential buildings and office towers, while also renovating the Shops at South Town shopping mall. The plans will also add new multi-use trails, the new Hale Center Theatre, and other amenities. The city center project is named The Cairns, with the project stretching between 9000 South and 11400 South, and Interstate 15 to the TRAX Blue Line. The project includes the American First Field and the Mountain America Exposition Center.

The project divides the city center into distinct urban villages; the areas currently under development include:
* Central Village – An office park and retail development along State Street;
* South Village – The largest village, home to City Hall, the Hale Center Theatre, the Shops at South Town, and retail and office space; and
* East Village – A transit-oriented development focused around Sandy Civic Center TRAX light rail station, including retail, office, and multi-family residential.
The master plan also includes study areas for future development and single-use areas that are unlikely to change.

==== Progress ====
As of February 2017, the first phase of the Shops at South Town redevelopment is complete and the Central Village office towers (including a new InContact headquarters), the Hale Center Theatre, and the Park at City Center residential project are near completion. The East Village transit-oriented development is nearly halfway complete, with residential projects near completion and mixed-use projects planned for a late 2017 or early 2018 groundbreaking. Transit enhancements are planned to connect the TRAX station to the South Jordan FrontRunner station, and create a link between the active villages, by way of rubber-tire bus, trolleybus, or tram. This route has been studied and is currently under planning.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.09%) is water.

The major residential region of eastern Sandy sits on the slopes of the Wasatch Range while the western section lies at the bottom of the valley. Interstate 15 and State Street (US-89) run through the western portions of the city, while the Jordan River forms part of the western border with West Jordan and South Jordan.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Sandy has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) or a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) depending on which variant of the system is used.

==Education==

Jordan School District was the primary school district in Sandy until 2009. In 2007, citizens voted to split Jordan School District to create 2 separate school districts - Jordan School District and the newly created Canyons School District. The Canyons School District is now the primary school district located in Sandy. It began operation at the beginning of the 2009–10 school year.

Sandy has 18 elementary schools (Alta View, Altara, Bell View, Brookwood, Crescent, East Sandy, Edgemont, Granite, Lone Peak, Oakdale, Park Lane, Peruvian Park, Quail Hollow, Sandy, Silver Mesa, Sprucewood, Sunrise, Willow Canyon), six middle schools (Albion, Crescent View, Eastmont, Indian Hills, Mount Jordan, Union), five high schools (Corner Canyon, Jordan, Hillcrest, Brighton, and Alta), one technical school (Canyons Technical Education Center—CTEC), and one alternative high school (Southpointe). The Blessed Sacrament School is a private Catholic elementary school.

Salt Lake Community College&#x27;s Miller Campus is located in Sandy, and is home to the college&#x27;s Automotive Training Center, Culinary Institute, Miller Business Resource Center for corporate training programs, and training facilities for the Utah Department of Public Safety. Sandy is also home to a continuing education campus for non-traditional students at the University of Utah, opened in 2015.

==Sports==
Sandy is home to Real Salt Lake, a Major League Soccer team established in 2004 that plays at the America First Field on the city&#x27;s west side and the Utah Royals, a National Women&#x27;s Soccer League team that also shares America First Field. The city will also be the home of the Utah Hockey Club practice facility. 

==Transportation==
=== Roadways ===
The city&#x27;s roads are located on the same grid system as the rest of Salt Lake County.
I-15 runs down the western side of Sandy, with three exits (at 9000 South, 10600 South and 11400 South) located in the city. An additional ramp was built in early 2017 to connect the 10600 South northbound off-ramp to Monroe Street. U.S. Route 89 runs parallel to I-15 through the city as State Street, and Utah State Route 209 runs east/west, terminating within the Wasatch Range at Alta Ski Resort.

=== Bus ===
The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates a bus system that reaches into the city (including two normal routes, three FLEX routes, and one ski service route). Bus routes serve nearby light rail stations, commercial districts (including the Shops at South Town and the State Street commercial district), office parks, and government offices. The ski bus route operates from Historic Sandy TRAX station to Alta Ski Area and Snowbird and runs seasonally.

Sandy and UTA are currently developing a circulator bus or trolley route between Sandy Civic Center TRAX station and South Jordan FrontRunner station. The route, not yet in service, will have the potential to convert into a streetcar route in the distant future. A feasibility study was conducted by UTA in 2015, outlining the need for a circulator route, which was established into Sandy&#x27;s long-term city center plan in January 2017. The route will incorporate a dedicated transit guideway on 10200 S over or under Interstate 15.

=== Rail ===
UTA&#x27;s TRAX light rail system operates in Sandy. The city is home to four light rail stations: Historic Sandy at 9000 South; Sandy Expo, an infill station at 9375 South, serving the Mountain America Exposition Center and America First Field; Sandy Civic Center at 10000 South, serving the city center and nearby transit-oriented developments; and Crescent View at 11400 South. All of Sandy&#x27;s light rail stations are on the Blue Line, terminating at Salt Lake Central Station to the north and Draper Town Center to the south.

<text>South Jordan is a city in south central Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, south of Salt Lake City. Part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the city lies in the Salt Lake Valley along the banks of the Jordan River between the Oquirrh Mountains and the Wasatch Mountains. The city has of the Jordan River Parkway that contains fishing ponds, trails, parks, and natural habitats. The Salt Lake County fair grounds and equestrian park, Oquirrh Lake, and 37 public parks are located inside the city. As of 2020, there were 77,487 people in South Jordan.

Founded in 1859 by settlers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and historically an agrarian town, South Jordan has become a rapidly growing bedroom community of Salt Lake City. Kennecott Land, a land development company, has recently begun construction on the master-planned Daybreak Community for the entire western half of South Jordan, potentially doubling South Jordan&#x27;s population. South Jordan was the first municipality in the world to have two temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Jordan River Utah Temple and Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple), it now shares that distinction with Provo, Utah. The city has two TRAX light rail stops, as well as one commuter rail stop on the &quot;FrontRunner&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-European===
The first known inhabitants were members of the Desert Archaic Culture who were nomadic hunter-gatherers. From 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D., the Fremont people settled into villages and farmed corn and squash. Changes in climatic conditions to a cooler, drier period and the movement into the area of ancestors of the Ute, Paiute, and Shoshone, led to the disappearance of the Fremont people. When European settlers arrived, there were no permanent Native American settlements in the Salt Lake Valley, but the area bordered several tribes – the territory of the Northwestern Shoshone to the north, the Timpanogots band of the Utes to the south in Utah Valley, and the Goshutes to the west in Tooele Valley.

The only recorded trapper to lead a party through the area was Étienne Provost, a French Canadian. In October 1824, Provost&#x27;s party was lured into an Indian camp somewhere along the Jordan River north of Utah Lake. The people responsible for the attack were planning revenge against Provost&#x27;s party for an earlier unexplained incident involving other trappers. Provost escaped, but his men were caught off-guard and fifteen of them were killed.

===Early Latter-day Saint settlement===
On July 22, 1847, an advanced party of the first Latter-day Saint pioneers entered the valley and immediately began to irrigate land and explore the area with a view to establishing new settlements. Alexander Beckstead, a blacksmith from Ontario, Canada, moved his family to the West Jordan area in 1849, and became the first of his trade in the south Salt Lake Valley. He helped dig the first ditch to divert water from the Jordan River, powering Archibald Gardner&#x27;s flour mill. In 1859, Beckstead became the first settler of South Jordan by moving his family along the Jordan River where they lived in a dugout cut into the west bluffs above the river. The flood plain of the Jordan was level, and could be cleared for farming if a ditch was constructed to divert river water along the base of the west bluff. Beckstead and others created the &quot;Beckstead Ditch&quot;, which is still in use for irrigation of city parks and Mulligan&#x27;s golf course.

In 1863, the South Jordan Branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized as a branch of the West Jordan Ward, giving South Jordan its name. The Branch consisted of just nine families. A school was built in 1864 out of adobe and also served as the Church Meetinghouse for the South Jordan Branch. As South Jordan grew, a new and larger building was constructed in 1873 on the east side of the site of the present-day cemetery. It had an upper and lower entrance with a granite foundation using left-over materials brought from the granite quarry at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon. The upper story was made of oversized adobe bricks. The main hall had curtains which could be pulled to section off the hall for classes. The meetinghouse also served as the &quot;ward&quot; school when it was held during the fall and winter months. It came to be known as the &quot;Mud Temple&quot;, and was in use until 1908.

In 1876, work was completed on the South Jordan Canal which took water out of the Jordan River in Bluffdale and brought it above the river bluffs for the first time. As a result of the new canal, most of the families moved up away from the river onto the &quot;flats&quot; above the river which they could now irrigate. In 1881, the Utah and Salt Lake Canal was completed. It runs parallels to the west side of today&#x27;s Redwood Road. With the completion of the canal system, greater acreage could be farmed, which led to the area&#x27;s population increasing.

===Twentieth century===

In the late 1890s, alfalfa hay was introduced and took the place of tougher native grasses which had been used up to that point for feed for livestock. In good years, alfalfa could produce three crops that were stored for winter. Sugar beets were introduced to South Jordan around 1910. Farmers liked sugar beets because they could be sold for cash at the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company factory in West Jordan.

A big celebration was held on January 14, 1914, to commemorate the arrival of electrical power, the addition of a water tank and supply system for indoor pumping and a new park for South Jordan. By the 1930s, the area needed a water tank to store water for residents living further west. The only way to get a federal grant was to incorporate and become a city. Citizens voted to incorporate on November 8, 1935, and immediately issued bonds to obtain money for the water tank. The city was initially governed by a Town Board with responsibilities over parks, water and the cemetery. In 1978, the city moved to a mayor-council form of government and assumed local supervision of police, fire, road and building inspections from Salt Lake County.

One of the worst school bus accidents in United States history occurred on December 1, 1938. A bus loaded with 38 students from South Jordan, Riverton, and Bluffdale crossed in front of an oncoming train that was obscured by fog and snow. The bus was broadsided killing the bus driver and 23 students.
The concern about bus safety from the South Jordan accident led to changes in state and eventually federal law mandating that buses stop and open the doors before proceeding into a railroad crossing. The same railroad crossing was the site of many other crashes in the following years with the last deadly crash occurring on December 31, 1995, when three teens died while crossing the tracks in their car. The crossing was finally closed, but not until crashes occurred in 1997 and 2002.
In 1950, Salt Lake County had devoted to farming. But by 1992, due to increasing population, land devoted to farming had decreased to . As a result of this urbanization, South Jordan&#x27;s economy went from agrarian to being a bedroom community of Salt Lake City. Kennecott Land began a development in 2004 called Daybreak, which is a planned community that will contain more than 20,000 homes and includes commercial and retail space. In 2022, the remaining undeveloped land was sold to Larry H. Miller Group. In 1981, the Jordan River Utah Temple was completed. In 2009, the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple was completed and became the second temple to be built in South Jordan. South Jordan was the first city in the world to have two temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, namely the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple and the Jordan River Utah Temple. The second city to carry that distinction is Provo, Utah, about 30 miles to the south of South Jordan. In May 2003 the Sri Ganesha Hindu Temple was completed.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , 0.4 percent, is water.

<text>South Salt Lake is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States and is part of the Salt Lake City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 26,777 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Jesse Fox Jr. developed the area South Salt Lake referred to as Central Park around 1890. Mr. Fox chose the name after visiting New York and seeing Central Park there. He was impressed by the park and its design within an urban environment. Despite South Salt Lake being rural at the time, he decided to name the area Central Park. In 1925 the LDS Central Park Ward was created and named after the development.

In 1936, an attempted annexation by Salt Lake City failed due to concerns over funding and implementation of a sewer system. On August 14, 1936, a resolution creating the Town of Central Park was approved by the Board of County Commissioners - however, this did not last long, as voters then decided to disincorporate the town in 1937. In a close vote, voters then approved incorporation of South Salt Lake.

On September 29, 1938, still in need of a sewer system, South Salt Lake voted to incorporate as the Town of South Salt Lake, with Robert R. Fitts as the first town president. The town was also lacking many other basic amenities at the time that would be easier to implement with incorporation, such as a post office and fire department. In 1939, the Works Progress Administration finally began construction of a sewer system, with a cost of $462,000. The original boundary of South Salt Lake was from 500 East to 300 West and 2100 South to Mill Creek on the south.

On August 1, 1950, the population had increased enough for South Salt Lake to be designated as a third class city. This changed the form of government to a mayor and city council. The town president of the time, Marlow Callahan, became the first mayor of the City of South Salt Lake.

In the 1990s, South Salt Lake annexed portions of an unincorporated portion of Salt Lake County to the south, and nearly doubled in land area and population. On January 4, 2010, Cherie Wood became South Salt Lake&#x27;s first female mayor.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city is bordered by the Jordan River on the west, 500 East and 700 East on the east, 2100 South on the north, and 3900 South on the south. West Valley City lies to the west, Salt Lake City to the north, northeast, and east; and Millcreek to the east, south, and southeast. Because of its location next to the Jordan River and well away from the mountains, it is mostly flat, only ranging in elevation from about to . It has a fairly high water table, with some areas being somewhat swampy before development in the early 1900s. Much city water comes through wells from the aquifer beneath the city. Three tributaries of Mill Creek converge in Fitts Park.

== Economy ==
* The world&#x27;s first Kentucky Fried Chicken (now KFC) franchise was established in 1952 by Harland Sanders and Pete Harman in what is now part of South Salt Lake.
* In 2012, a Chinatown development opened on a lot in the city near 3500 South and State Street. It is the only Chinatown in the Intermountain West. In addition to having many Asian-themed restaurants, it has a large Asian-themed supermarket. According to the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, ground breaking on the new Chinatown occurred in 2011 for a Chinese-themed shopping mall with a &quot;... 27,000 square foot Asian grocery store, 65,000 square foot indoor mall including 38 Asian-themed shops and 12,000 square feet Asian-themed strip mall&quot;. Margaret Yee, a 1962 graduate said that &quot;... 10,000-plus Chinese nationals living in the area have wanted [a Chinatown] for a long time...&quot; By late 2012, the Chinatown has experienced an upsurge of Chinese immigrants and the businesses are now filling up the Chinatown. 
* In 2017, after nearly 7 years of planning, ground was broken on a new mixed-use development known as The Crossing (formerly called Market Station) between State St. and Main St. just south of 2100 South, intended to serve as South Salt Lake&#x27;s &quot;downtown&quot;. This development is oriented around mass transit, with an S-Line streetcar stop adjacent to the development, and 1 stop away from the Central Pointe TRAX Station. The first phase includes a WinCo Foods and a townhome development. Ultimately, this downtown development is planned to have 2,500 family housing units, 1.5 million square feet of retail, 3 million square feet of office and commercial space, and additional greenspace and trails.

== Crime ==

Since 2007, crime in South Salt Lake has been reduced by 30%. Former SSL Police Chief Chris Snyder attributes the drop in crime to 4 factors: 1) Increased attention to code enforcement, 2) Crime Free Rental Housing program that results in greater landlord scrutiny of potential renters, 3) Partnerships, such as that with United Way of Salt Lake, combined with community organizing, such as the Promise South Salt Lake initiative, South Salt Lake Community Connection that address resident needs and improve neighborhoods, and 4) Extensive youth development efforts, such as Promise afterschool programs delivered in nine Neighborhood Centers across the city, and urban/neighborhood revitalization projects. There is a new emphasis on redevelopment (including the Market Station development) and a reduction in the number of liquor licenses allowed to be issued is anticipated to reduce crime in the city.

The Motovo Real Estate Blog ranked South Salt Lake as the &quot;Most Dangerous Place in Utah&quot; citing data from the 2012 FBI Uniform Crime Report. Their report found that South Salt Lake had the most violent crimes per capita in Utah, with the second highest non-violent crime rate as well.

==Transportation==
I-15, I-80, and SR-201 intersect in the northwestern portion of the city. This interchange is known locally as the &quot;Spaghetti Bowl&quot; due to its complex array of on and off ramps, which extend to several other city roads in the area. US-89 runs north-to-south along State Street through the heart of South Salt Lake, serving as the primary commercial corridor and includes an interchange at I‑80. SR-171 (3300 South) traverses the city east-to-west, with an interchange at I‑15. SR-71 (South 700 East) runs along the southern part of the east border of the city and also has an interchange at I‑80.
Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s (UTA) TRAX light rail runs through the city at about 200 West, with 3 stations located within the city limits. All three of the TRAX lines (Blue, Red, and Green) enter the city from the north at Central Pointe station. (The UTA Police Department was located at the Central Pointe station until it moved to its new location at Murray Central station in July 2016.) From Central Pointe station the Green Line heads west to West Valley City while both the Blue and Red lines continue south to stop at the Millcreek station before leaving the city just south of the Meadowbrook station. UTA also has several local bus routes that run through the city, many of which stop every fifteen minutes.

In December 2013, the S Line streetcar (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) opened for service. The S Line was built along an existing rail line just south of 2100 South (the northern border of the city) from the Central Pointe station to the Sugar House neighborhood in southeastern Salt Lake City. In addition to Central Pointe station, the S Line will include stops at South Main Street (South Salt Lake City station), South 300 East (300 East station), and South 500 East (500 East station) before leaving the city. Although operated by UTA, the S Line is a joint project between South Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, and UTA.

==Notable sites==
One of South Salt Lake&#x27;s most notable and historic buildings is the Columbus Center. Originally a school around the turn of the 20th century, it was later used as a daycare center beginning in the 1950s. After being condemned in the late 1980s, it was renovated and expanded to include a branch of the Salt Lake County Library System as well as an auditorium, senior center and several other facilities.

==Education==
South Salt Lake lies within the Granite School District. The city is served by three public elementary schools (Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Roosevelt) (PK–6), and one junior high school (Granite Park Junior High). With Mayor Wood&#x27;s emphasis on education, two charter schools have located in South Salt Lake, Alianza (K–8) and the Utah International Charter School (7–12). The Salt Lake City campus of Broadview University is located next to the South Salt Lake city offices, and the city also has strong ties and partnerships with local institutions of higher education, Salt Lake Community College and Westminster College. Utah State University has a satellite campus located within the Granite District Offices at 2500 South State Street, also in South Salt Lake.

<text>Taylorsville is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah. It is part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The population was 60,448 at the time of the 2020 census. Taylorsville was incorporated from the Taylorsville–Bennion CDP and portions of the Kearns metro township on July 1, 1996. The city is located adjacent to Interstate 215 and Bangerter Highway. It is located in the middle of the Salt Lake Valley.

==History==
The area called Taylorsville today is made up of two historic communities in the central part of Salt Lake County: Taylorsville and Bennion. These communities incorporated through a vote of the people with over 70 percent approval in September 1995. The city officially became the City of Taylorsville during the centennial anniversary of Utah&#x27;s statehood in 1996.

The land on which Taylorsville is located is part of an interconnected alluvial plain that was formed by the wearing down of the Wasatch and Oquirrh Mountains to the east and west. Beneath the surface, Taylorsville sits on more than a kilometer of unconsolidated rock, sand, and clay. The inactive Taylorsville Fault has been traced down the center of the Salt Lake Valley. Lake Bonneville shaped the topography of the area and deposited lake bottom clay and sand. As Lake Bonneville dried up over the past 14,000 years, the salt from the breakdown of rock remains, making the soil alkaline. Like most desert soils, it has little organic material and is hard to work.

A broad, east-west running ridge called &quot;Bennion Hill&quot; rises perhaps a hundred and fifty feet above the surrounding area. Bennion Hill is the eastern end of a wide ridge that rises toward Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains to the west.

The first (unnamed) people in the region appeared during or after the last ice age on the shores of what remained of Lake Bonneville. Less than five miles (8  km) from Taylorsville evidence of people killing and eating a mammoth have been found. Some of this region&#x27;s first named visitors were Fremont people who used the area to hunt and gather food along the Jordan River more than a thousand years ago. A large Fremont settlement on City Creek used the land where Taylorsville is located as hunting and foraging especially along the river. In more recent times Ute bands passed through the valley between the marshes of the Great Salt Lake and Utah Valley. Most of the area was dry sagebrush-covered land without any natural water sources except the Jordan River. A well-used Ute trail wound along the west side of the river at approximately 1300 West which the Ute used in spring and fall. Early settlers observed small encampments of Ute in the cottonwoods along the Jordan River. At least one local settler called these people the &quot;Yo-No&#x27;&quot;. Whether the name is his creation or an approximation of something they said is unknown.

There are poorly documented suggestions that Spanish missionaries, soldiers, and explorers came through the area beginning in the mid-1600s. The whole region was called &quot;Teguayo&quot; and &quot;Lake Copalla&quot; (Utah Lake) appear on maps of Spanish Nuevo Mexico. Spanish and then Mexican land claims remained until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which ended the Mexican War in 1853 and ceded the whole of northern Mexico to the United States including a few thousand Mormon settlers who had taken up residence in July 1847.

=== Mormon settlement ===

The first Mormon pioneer settlers, Joseph and Susanna Harker from England built a log cabin on the west side of the Jordan River in November 1848 on what was called then &quot;the Church Farm&quot; near 3300 South. In 1849, Samuel and John Bennion and several other families moved south crossing the river on the ice in January. There was little in the way of building materials, so the families dug into the bluffs of the Jordan River for shelter. The tiny settlement, the first &quot;over Jordan,&quot; was called Harker&#x27;s Settlement, and they began the difficult work of digging ditches to move water out of the Jordan River and onto the land on the west side. The soil was hard to work and they kept looking for better land to farm. The infamous crickets destroyed much of that year&#x27;s crop and so the group moved farther south to where Big Cottonwood Creek flowed into the Jordan River about 4800 South known then as Field&#x27;s Bottom.

By working together, eight families managed to bring in the first successful crop in 1851 using water brought down from Bingham Creek by what was later called Gardner&#x27;s Millrace. John and Esther Bennion&#x27;s daughter, Rachael, was the first pioneer child to be born in Field&#x27;s Bottom. Despite the struggle to get food and shelter in those early days, John Bennion described Field&#x27;s Bottom in these words:

&quot;if peace dwells upon this earth it is here and here are the&quot;
&quot;happiest and most prosperous people in the world, enjoying free&quot;
&quot;soil, pure air, liberty to worship our God just as we please…&quot;

By 1851, more families settled in or near Field&#x27;s Bottom where they dug the &quot;lower ditch&quot; and cleared land for small farms and pastures. In January 1852 Harker&#x27;s Settlement was organized as a part of the West Jordan LDS Ward that included the Salt Lake Valley west of the Jordan River. Some families returned to cabins they had built earlier and dismantled them and brought the logs across the river and reassembled the cabins.

In 1853, the continued threat of attack by angry Utes, locally called the &quot;Walker War&quot; or the &quot;Utah Valley War&quot;, forced the settlers to build an adobe fort called the English Fort just north of the North Jordan Burying Ground in 1854. Stories about &quot;Indian depredations&quot; in Utah and Sanpete Counties and the massacre of John W. Gunnison and his surveying party caused such fear that Salt Lake City fortified itself. Two livestock herders were killed in Cedar Valley, just over &quot;South Mountain&quot; and the Ute attacked cattle herds in Tooele County just over the Oquirrh Mountains. Isolated settlements either built forts or were abandoned. Locals nicknamed the fort in North Jordan, &quot;Fort Hardscrabble,&quot; because it was built on what they considered a useless piece of ground. About 30 families moved into or near the fort for protection for the winter, but as the threat of attack faded, families spread out once again and part of the fort was converted into an LDS meeting house which also served as the school.

Hickman Fort, farther south in Bennion, was built by William Hickman. It was located about 5800 South on the bluff above the west side of the river. Between 1853 and 1857 Gardner&#x27;s Millrace was extended north to the Bennion area and called the North Jordan Canal, the first important canal on the west side of the Jordan River.

Up until 1859, the West Jordan Ward was headquartered in what is today Taylorsville.

By 1860, Harker&#x27;s Settlement, as the area was called, had 178 residents. The first post office was established with the name Taylorsville which was the name of the LDS branch in that part of the North Jordan, perhaps to distinguish it from Granger. The post office was discontinued later. Elizabeth Harker&#x27;s home was used for the first school classes.

In 1858, the threat of Johnston&#x27;s Army marching down Emigration Canyon forced many settlers to pack up everything they could and move south until the situation could be resolved. Most residents ended up in Spanish Fork or camped out at Pondtown (Salem) near Utah Lake. The home guard who remained behind to watch over the settlement observed the &quot;Johnston&#x27;s Army&quot; camp the first night after passing through Salt Lake on the &quot;flats&quot; above the North Jordan farms. Its large livestock herd ate everything to within an inch of the ground. The US Army continued on its way the next morning. In July 1858 Taylorsville residents returned and settled back into the interrupted routine of summertime chores. By 1859 the adobe fort was dissolving into the mud from which it was created. It was decided to build a log school on top of the &quot;hill&quot; on 4800 South which was closer to where most people in Taylorsville lived.

In 1859, the West Jordan Ward included all of Salt Lake County west of the Jordan River and even had a section east of the river. The North Jordan dependent branch of the West Jordan stake was organized in 1859. Its first president was John Bennion. He was succeeded in 1863 by Samuel Bennion. He was later succeeded by Heber Bennion so that until 1907 the presiding LDS authority in Taylorsville was a Bennion.

The area west of Jordan was divided into the West Jordan, South Jordan, North Jordan, and Herriman LDS Wards. North Jordan, also known as Taylorsville, had a dependent branch at Bennion. The first business in Taylorsville was a small store located near the school and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop across the street. John Webster, the blacksmith, was appointed postmaster and once a week carried mail from Murray in a clothes basket. In 1867 the log school was replaced by a three-room school made of rock and brick called &quot;the Rock Schoolhouse&quot; that was used until 1898.

By 1876, the South Jordan Canal and the North Jordan Canal were joined to carry water from the Jordan River above the bluffs west of the Jordan and brought land from South Jordan to Granger under cultivation. This brought more families to the area, almost all of them farmers. Land west of the canals was cleared for dry farms that were planted in the fall and harvested in early summer. A few families moved just north of Taylorsville near 6200 South and Redwood Road. John Bennion, one of the early settlers, gave this area its name, Bennion. A tiny blue schoolhouse was built on the corner of Redwood Road and 6200 South for the children to attend.

In the 1880s, LDS Church president, John Taylor, hid from United States Marshals Service officers at a home on the west side of the Jordan River near 4800 South. John Taylor&#x27;s association with Taylorsville has often been used to explain its name. The name, Taylorsville, used before the 1880s seems to call the John Taylor explanation for the town&#x27;s name into question. However, since Taylor was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve before the Mormons even arrived in Utah, and was the wounded survivor of the mob attack that killed Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and served at various times as speaker of the Utah Territorial Legislature, naming the town after Taylor at any point from 1847 on is quite believable.

In 1881, the Utah and Salt Lake Canal was built which allowed irrigation farming to expand even farther west above the river between Bluffdale and Granger. Un-irrigated land to the west was cleared and planted as dry farms. The 1880s saw a sawmill, gristmill, and woolen mill built in West Jordan. Rawlings shoe repair store was constructed. The Bennion brothers built a grist mill at 4800 South and the Jordan River.

In 1894, a three-room schoolhouse was built out of red brick, called the 64 District School. It sat on two acres on the corner of 6200 South and Redwood Road. The name of the school was later changed to Madison School. Enough musicians lived in the area to establish a brass band. People in Taylorsville and Bennion depended on growing corn, wheat, oats, and alfalfa. In the 1890s sugar beets became big business and many farmers started to clear additional land to grow them. The beets were hauled to the West Jordan cutting station until 1916 when the West Jordan Sugar Factory was completed. Taylorsville and Bennion remained very small farming towns.

The 1890s saw increased growth and the establishment of a small business district at the intersection of Redwood Road and 4800 South. The largest store was Lindsay and Company which was later called the Taylorsville Mercantile Company. In 1894 the Taylorsville LDS Meetinghouse was built to house the Taylorsville Ward of the LDS church.

In 1905, Bennion was made a separate ward from Taylorsville. Before this point, it was often referred to as South Taylorsville.

=== Twentieth century ===

The territorial legislature passed Utah&#x27;s first Compulsory Education Law in 1890 which gradually brought most children off the farms and into the classroom. It had little effect until the early 1900s when small local school districts, seen as a roadblock to raising the standard of Utah education, were consolidated. In December 1904 the Salt Lake County Commission voted to combine 22 of the 36 local school districts into the Granite School District with boundaries that matched the LDS Granite Stake boundaries. Schools which up to that time were often numbered were given names.

In 1905, 600 people lived in Bennion, enough to split from the Taylorsville LDS Ward and create the Bennion Ward to the south. Meetings were held in the red brick schoolhouse for a time until the Bennion meetinghouse was built in 1907 at the corner of 6200 South and Redwood Road next to the school.

The need for a &quot;modern&quot; school and the establishment of compulsory tax-supported public schools throughout Utah gave rise to the old Plymouth Elementary School on Redwood Road and 4800 South. By 1907, there were so many children in the Bennion school that the upper grades were sent to the two-story red brick Plymouth School in Taylorsville. In 1909 an amusement hall and classrooms were added to the Taylorsville Chapel. Electricity came to the Taylorsville area during the early 1900s but had little effect on the life of most people who saw little use for it outside lighting their homes. It was considered a luxury and many families chose not to connect until the 1920s or 1930s when rural electrification made power available to everyone.

Two railroads were important to Taylorsville, the Rio Grande, and Western to Bingham Junction (Midvale), and the Bingham-Garfield Railroad was added through the area in 1910. A well was dug at 4700 South and 5400 West where a locomotive watering station was built. In 1913 the electric Salt Lake Inter-Urban, often call the &quot;Orem Line&quot;, was built to make it possible to ride into Salt Lake or as far as Payson on the &quot;Red Arrow&quot; in from the Francklyn Station in Murray or at the Bennion Station. The line ran parallel to Redwood Road about 1800 West. In 1915 the first water system was built by private subscription. People who wanted clean water piped to their homes paid to have it delivered to them. Later this system was bought and expanded by the Taylorsville-Bennion Improvement District. Electricity came to the area in 1916 along Redwood Road. During World War I four young men from Taylorsville lost their lives and sixteen served in the armed forces.

By the 1920s, two canals were built to carry water to farms farther and farther west. Redwood Road was finally rebuilt using concrete making it faster and easier to travel for the mixture of automobiles, wagons, and horses that used it. How Redwood Road got its name has been the subject of much debate but, when there are no redwoods in the valley, the following explanation rings truest. A line parallel to the base meridian was surveyed on the west side of the Jordan River for use in measuring property lines. Redwood stakes that did not decay in the ground were used for the &quot;Redwood Line&quot;. It remained the Redwood Line until 1895 when Redwood Road was built as the main thoroughfare for the west side of Salt Lake County. In 1927 the &quot;Pole Line Road&quot; 2700 West was constructed.

=== World War II ===

In World War II, 75 men from Taylorsville served and two lost their lives overseas. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States Army Air Corps wanted an isolated place to build a training base safe from any attacks by the Japanese and on the main rail routes to the Pacific Coast. The United States Department of War bought of dry farmland in the western part of Salt Lake Valley. The land originally was part of a federal land grant to the state of Utah to be used to benefit schools and universities in Utah. But it had long since passed into private hands and was used for dry farms. Camp Kearns went through renamings as the focus and mission of the base changed; Camp Kearns was the name which stuck. It opened in 1942 but took about a year to gain its final size. The base was named for Senator Thomas Kearns of Utah, who had made his fortune in the silver mines at Park City. Camp Kearns was not in Taylorsville but to the west of the settlement.

A year later, Camp Kearns had 40,000 residents and was Utah&#x27;s third-largest city at the time. It had two main missions. It served as a basic training facility for replacement troops headed for the war against Japan. Camp Kearns included a 600-target practice range, the largest in the U.S., a difficult, mile-long obstacle course, a grenade practice ground, and barracks for thousands of men on their way to the Pacific coast. The motor pool hired more than 80 local women just to drive trucks; in all about 1200 civilians worked at the base at any given time. Camp Kearns had the largest hospital in Utah at the time which spread into ten buildings. A camp newspaper called the &quot;Valley View News&quot; provided information and entertainment to the troops stationed there.

The base had a water system and one of two water treatment plants in the state. The streets were laid out in a huge grid pattern lined with over 900 wooden buildings covered with tar paper. A railroad spur from the Denver and the Rio Grande was built to transport equipment and personnel to the base. By August 21, 1942, the Kearns had of warehouse space, two all-purpose theaters, gyms, two firehouses, several dusty parade grounds, a post office, a lending library, and a bank. Thousands of trees and shrubs were planted to keep the dust down.

The second mission of Camp Kearns was a practice air force base for Army Air Corps ground crews. In time, technical training of air force ground crews became Camp Kearns&#x27;s main objective. This included many kinds of schools: navigation, intelligence, radio, teleprinter, clerical, and many others. It was not an air force base with airplanes landing and taking off, ground crews were trained on planes scattered around the base.

The base had five chapels, three stores, and three theaters, one of them for African-American servicemen. It still exists as part of Kearns Junior High School. The United Service Organizations brought many entertainers to the base to keep the troops from getting homesick. The Band Wagon Committee raised more than $15,000,000 in war bonds from the communities around Salt Lake and the men and women in uniform.

Camp Kearns gave an indirect boost to Taylorsville in that a huge water pipe brought water from the east side of Salt Lake to the camp. Once Camp Kearns closed, the presence of clean drinking water and a sewer treatment plant made it possible for people to move to Kearns and live in some of the first large subdivisions built in western Salt Lake County in the 1950s. But the camp is not in the Taylorsville city limits but the Kearns metro township.

Taylorsville and Bennion joined to form their own water and sewer district to provide clean water. The large water tank on the hill at 3200 west and 6200 South and the other ones buried inside the hill are a part of the work to provide the clean water. Salt Lake County&#x27;s rapidly-growing population began expanding west in the early 1970s and farmers found they could sell their land to developers for a lot more than they were making on the farms.

=== Incorporation ===
In the 1980s, the intersection at Redwood Road 5400 South began to be developed into a regional retail center with Harmons, Grand Central, Walmart, and the Family Center. Taylorsville, Bennion, and Kearns continued rapid growth into the early 1990s. Some people felt that the Salt Lake County Commission, which governed the area, was allowing too much growth too fast, especially apartment complexes. The county seemed unwilling to listen to residents which resulted in the first drive to incorporate Taylorsville City. It failed by a narrow margin.

In 1995, voters approved the creation of a new city due to the rising costs of county services, a feeling that the county was not giving residents their money&#x27;s worth revolving around insufficient law enforcement, a lack of input in how Taylorsville and Bennion were developing, and the seemingly unlimited apartment developments.

Many Kearns residents were upset when Taylorsville&#x27;s proposed boundary extended its western border to 4000 West which was considered by residents in that area to be part of Kearns. But residents there approved Taylorsville&#x27;s incorporation by a significant margin, (as they were given large tax breaks) and that is where the border remains.

After incorporation, there was a lively discussion about what the new city should be called. Midvalley City, Oquirrh City, Centennial, and Taylorsville–Bennion were all discussed. Eventually, Taylorsville was chosen. Taylorsville&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Utah&#x27;s Centennial City&quot; because it officially came into existence 100 years after Utah became a state.

==Governance==
Taylorsville is governed by a five-member city council, mayor, and presiding judge representing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. City council members and the mayor are elected to staggered four-year terms of office. The election of city council members and the mayor are non-partisan, contested elections. The presiding judge and other judges serve six-year terms of office. Every six years, the judges must stand for retention in an unopposed, non-partisan election. The retention election of the judges is county-wide and are the only municipal elected positions to permit voters from outside of the city boundaries to vote for or against a city official.

The city has been divided into five districts each with its own city council member. There are no &quot;at-large&quot; seats. The mayor is the only elected position that runs citywide. The city council elects from its members a chairperson and vice-chairperson who are responsible for the organization and operation of the city council.

In addition to its mayor, the executive branch is managed by a full-time city administrator. The city administrator is appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. While the city contracts for many of its services (public works, garbage collection, street and road maintenance), it has its own code enforcement, economic development, police, and community development departments. Unified Fire Authority is managed and funded separately from the city of which the City has a seat on the UFA board.

The judicial branch is vested in a municipal justice court which is administered by a presiding judge. The presiding judge is elected from amongst the judges of the court and confirmed by the city council. The presiding judge, with the input of all of the judges of the court, oversees the hiring and training of all court personnel and manages the court budget. The Taylorsville Court is notable by establishing the second DUI (drunk driving) court in the nation and the first misdemeanor Drug/DUI hybrid court in Utah. In addition, the Court has a dedicated Domestic Violence calendar and a Dual Focus program for Drug/Alcohol abusers with a history of violence. Judges serve six-year terms and must stand for a retention election at the end of each term.

<text>West Jordan is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. It is a suburb of Salt Lake City. According to the 2020 Census, the city had a population of 116,961, placing it as the third most populous in the state. The city occupies the southwest end of the Salt Lake Valley at an elevation of 4,330 feet (1,320 m). Named after the nearby Jordan River, the limits of the city begin on the river&#x27;s western bank and end in the eastern foothills of the Oquirrh Mountains, where Kennecott Copper Mine, the world&#x27;s largest man-made excavation, is located.

Settled in the mid-19th century, the city has developed into its own regional center. , the city has four major retail centers; with Jordan Landing being one of the largest mixed-use planned developments in the Intermountain West. Companies headquartered in West Jordan include Mountain America Credit Union, Lynco Sales &amp; Service, SME Steel, and Cyprus Credit Union. The city has one major hospital, Jordan Valley Medical Center, and a campus of Salt Lake Community College.

City landmarks include &quot;Gardner Village&quot;, established in 1850, and South Valley Regional Airport, formerly known as &quot;Salt Lake Airport #2&quot;. The airport serves general aviation operations as well as a base for the 211th Aviation Regiment of the Utah Army National Guard flying Apache and Black Hawk helicopters.

==History==

West Jordan received its name from Mormon settlers who entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847 under the leadership of their prophet, Brigham Young. These first European-Americans named the river flowing west of their first settlement, Salt Lake City, the Western Jordan, a reference to the River Jordan in Jordan. The name was later simplified to &quot;Jordan River&quot;. Like its Middle Eastern namesake, the Jordan River flows from a fresh water lake (Utah Lake) to an inland salt sea (Great Salt Lake). West Jordan was founded around 1849 on the western banks of the Jordan River.

One of the first sawmills in the area was built in 1850 in the city by Archibald Gardner. Gardner was a devout Mormon whose legacy can still be seen in modern West Jordan. His collection of mills and houses, now historic, have been renovated into a specialty shopping district known as &quot;Gardner Village&quot;.

Early West Jordan relied primarily on agriculture, mills, and mining activity to form the base of its economy. The first leather tannery west of the Mississippi River was constructed in the city in 1851.

Today, West Jordan is one of the fastest-growing cities in Utah. Growth has been phenomenal, beginning in the 1970s and continuing unabated since. The population grew from 4,221 in 1970 to 27,327 in 1980, 42,892 in 1990, and 68,336 in 2000, reaching 103,712 according to the 2010 Census. Sears chose the city as its first &quot;Sears Grand&quot; location, a new store concept, which opened its doors in 2003 at the Jordan Landing shopping center. Transportation issues along with school overcrowding are the city&#x27;s top concerns as it attempts to deal with rapid population growth.

Current major construction projects include a new main campus for the Salt Lake Community College, the expansion of Jordan Valley Hospital, and Midvale&#x27;s current transit-oriented development on the east border in the Jordan River bed.

West Jordan has become a regional center for government services. The Veteran’s Park Area includes City Hall, the Thomas Rees Justice Center that houses the West Jordan Police and Justice Court. Also included in the area is Fire Station 52, the Salt Lake County Health Department, Utah Third District Court, the Salt Lake District Attorney’s Office, and the Viridian Events Center and Library. The Park also includes a rodeo arena, a senior center (operated by Salt Lake County), and Gene Fuller Recreation Center, name after former boxing great Gene Fullmer.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 30.9 square miles (80.0 km2), all land.

West Jordan is bordered on the west by the Oquirrh Mountains and on the east by the Jordan River. The western neighborhoods of Welby, Copper Hills, and Jordan Hills are rapidly growing regions located along the lower slopes of the eastern Oquirrh Mountains. The fastest development is currently taking place between 4800 West and State Route 111, a highway that traverses the slopes of the Oquirrh Mountains.

The city lies approximately southwest of downtown Salt Lake City. The city is bordered on the north by Taylorsville and Kearns, on the south by South Jordan, on the east by Sandy, Murray and Midvale, on the west by Copperton, and on the extreme northwestern corner by West Valley City.

==Government==
West Jordan was incorporated on January 10, 1941. In November 2017, the citizens voted to change the form of government to a council-mayor form beginning at noon on January 6, 2020. The city council is composed of seven individuals: a chair, vice-chair and five council members. The chair and vice-chair are elected by the council every year. The chair is limited to two consecutive terms of one year without a one-year break. The council chair presides at city council meetings. The mayor is the chief executive of the city and appoints a chief administrative officer to oversee the functions of the city. The city council provides policy and direction for the city. The mayor implements the council&#x27;s policies and can exercise veto power unless the council uses its veto override power which requires 5 votes.

The mayor and city council members are elected to four-year terms. Four city council members are elected from four districts within the city, while the other three are elected at-large or citywide. The mayor and the four city council members representing a district are elected at the same time while the three at-large council members are elected during an offset two year election cycle. Thus ensuring that at least one city official representing the whole city is voted on every two years. All terms begin on January 1 following their respective election. Dirk Burton is the mayor.

==Demographics==

===2020 census===
According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2017, there were 113,905 people in West Jordan. The racial makeup of the county was 72.2% non-Hispanic White, 1.2% Black, 0.7% Native American, 2.8% Asian, 1.5% Pacific Islander, and 2.9% from two or more races. 19.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Education==

Most of West Jordan lies in the Jordan School District; however, due to a pair of annexations, two small sections along the northern border lie within the Granite School District. The city has 16 elementary schools (including one in the Granite District, Jim Bridger Elementary), four middle schools, and two high schools (West Jordan and Copper Hills). It is also the location of campuses of Salt Lake Community College and Broadview University.

Salt Lake Community College&#x27;s Jordan Campus is located in West Jordan. The Jordan Campus offers general education classes as well as all of the college&#x27;s health science courses. Jordan School District&#x27;s Applied Technology Center is also located on campus.

==Transportation==
Interstate 15, a twelve-lane freeway, is located east of the city limits, providing access from the north and south, while Interstate 215, an eight-lane beltway, is located northeast of the city. Bangerter Highway (State Route 154), a six-lane expressway, traverses the center of the city, just east of South Valley Regional Airport and the Jordan Landing shopping center. A ten-lane freeway called the Mountain View Corridor (SR-85) is planned to have three exits in the city (7800 S, 9000 S, and Old Bingham Hwy.) and run north–south at about 5800 West in the south and bend west to 6400 West in the north. The first phase of the project was completed December 15, 2012.

7800 South enters the city at the Jordan River and runs west through the city until it intersects with Utah Road 111. Redwood Road (State Route 68), a six-lane road, runs through the eastern portion of the city. In the far western extremes of the city, State Route 111, a two-lane road, runs through the developing rural area along the foothills. Development has recently begun to expand beyond SR-111.

In the middle of West Jordan is located the South Valley Regional Airport. Its FAA designation is U-42. It was formally known as Airport #2, because it is owned by Salt Lake City and is a subsidiary of Salt Lake City International Airport. The Airport was originally part of Camp Kearns and was the Kearns Army Airfield during World War II. Because of its location within the city, a large shopping center was built next to the airport, which resulted in the shopping center being named Jordan Landing.

West Jordan is served by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) bus system, which runs every half-hour during peak hours. All of the routes running into the city connect to nearby TRAX stations in Midvale and Sandy or to downtown Salt Lake City. Service in the city was increased during the August 2007 redesign of the bus system. A TRAX light rail line also serves the area. This line begins at the Fashion Place West station in Murray and run southwest through West Jordan, with 6 stops in the city, before turning south and terminating at the Daybreak Community in South Jordan. The route was opened on August 7, 2011.

Transportation has been a major issue in city politics. The city&#x27;s population has expanded from about 4,000 in 1970 to over 100,000 in 2010, outstripping the capacity of roadways and infrastructure. At city council meetings it has been common for residents, particularly those on the western edge of the city, to complain about having one-hour commutes to downtown Salt Lake City, a distance of . Elected officials have blamed this situation on the fact that the city is the most populous in the state that is not directly served by a freeway. In addition to significant road widening projects throughout the city, the Mountain View Corridor, a future freeway, is partially completed to service the western portion of the city.

<text>West Valley City is a city in Salt Lake County and a suburb of Salt Lake City in the U.S. state of Utah. The population was 140,230 at the 2020 census,
making it the second-most populous city in Utah after Salt Lake City. The city incorporated in 1980 from a large, quickly growing unincorporated area, combining the four communities of Granger, Hunter, Chesterfield, and Redwood. It is home to the Maverik Center and Utah First Credit Union Amphitheatre.

==History==
The earliest known residents of the western Salt Lake Valley were Native American bands of the Ute and Shoshoni tribes.

The first European people to live in the area were the Latter-day Saints. The Euro-Americans arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. The area was first staked out by settler Joseph Harker and his family in the area they named as &quot;over Jordan&quot; (referring to the land west of the Jordan River, which runs through the valley).

The Granger area was settled by Welsh pioneers who came to Utah with Dan Jones in 1849. Irrigation systems and agriculture were developed in the area, and Elias Smith proposed the area&#x27;s name on account of its successful farming. The population of Granger and its vicinity was about 1,000 people in 1930.

Hunter was not settled until 1876. This settlement was started by Rasmus Nielson, Edward Rushton, August Larsen and about seven others along with their families. Irrigation began in 1881 and the main crop was fruit trees.

The city began to experience rapid growth in the 1970s, when the area that is now West Valley City consisted of the four separate communities of Hunter, Granger, Chesterfield, and Redwood. These four unincorporated areas merged in 1980 to form the present-day city. During the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, West Valley City was the official venue for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey.

On May 19, 2011, the city unveiled an official plan to create a downtown area for the city over the course of 10 years, building on plans and development that already existed. It will be known as Fairbourne Station (named after Joseph Fairbourne, an early settler who operated a weigh station in the area in the late 19th century) and will consist of approximately , costing $500 million to build. The center will include a civic center (consisting of city hall, a courthouse, police headquarters, and a library), an eight-story Embassy Suites hotel, a plaza, and residential development, as well as the end of the TRAX Green Line, and a stop on the 3500 South MAX bus rapid transit line. Valley Fair Mall and the Maverik Center are located nearby, as is I-215. , the development is incomplete with the TRAX line having opened in 2011 and the hotel in 2012, but the City Hall and the government center still under construction.

Serial killer Ted Bundy was arrested in Granger on August 16, 1975, on a routine traffic stop.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 35.5 square miles (91.8 km2), of which 35.4 square miles (91.7 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) (0.17%) is water.

West Valley is located on the northwest side of the Salt Lake Valley between Salt Lake City on the north, South Salt Lake on the east, Magna on the west, and Taylorsville and Kearns Township on the south. The Oquirrh Mountains loom over the city to the west, while the Jordan River marks the eastern boundary.

West Valley City has a nonpartisan, strong city manager form of government, which means that the city manager is analogous to a corporation&#x27;s CEO, while the mayor fills a role similar to chairman of the board, with the City Council acting as the &quot;board&quot;. The mayor is a voting member of the City Council. The West Valley City Council meets each Tuesday night at 6:30 PM, except fifth Tuesdays. City Hall is located at 3600 South Constitution Boulevard.

==Government==
The mayor and six councilors are elected to four-year terms. Mayoral elections are held the same year as three of the councilors. The other three councilors are staggered two years from the mayoral. Two council seats are at-large, or citywide, and the remaining four seats represent districts of approximately 28,000 residents. Officials are not subject to term limits. , the most recent election was held in November, 2013.

In the Utah State Legislature, West Valley City is in Senate Districts 1, 3, 5, and 12 represented by Democrat Luz Escamilla, Democrat Gene Davis, Democrat Karen Mayne, and Republican Daniel Thatcher and House Districts 30, 31, and 33, represented by Republican Fred Cox, Republican Sophia DiCaro, and Republican Craig Hall. Federally, West Valley City lies in the 2nd and 4th congressional districts, represented by Republicans Chris Stewart and Burgess Owens.

=== Police ===

The West Valley City Police Department (WVCPD) provides law enforcement services to the city. the police chief is Colleen Jacobs, a 21 year veteran of the department, who oversees 218 sworn officers and 47 support staff.

In 2013, the city police&#x27;s narcotics unit was disbanded after an officer-involved critical incident revealed drugs and money had not been booked into evidence. Officers in the unit were also found to be keeping change and small items from seized vehicles, and placing tracking devices on potential suspects&#x27; vehicles without warrants.

In 2016, Officer Cody Brotherson was killed in the line of duty, the department&#x27;s only such fatality.

In 2019, an officer shot and killed a handcuffed man who was attempting to pull an officer&#x27;s gun out of its holster: this killing was found legally justified by the district attorney.

The name &quot;Tʼáá Bííchʼį́įdii&quot; was the nickname of an Anglo storekeeper named J.B. Tanner who worked at a trading post in Aneth. The nickname means &quot;just like a devil&quot; in Navajo and was given to him by the local community due to his greedy business practices. He also worked in Yah-ta-hey, New Mexico, leading the Navajo to use the same name for both towns.

==Education==
The San Juan School District operates the Montezuma Creek Elementary School in Aneth. In 2017 the school offered to give salaries of $80,000 to teachers with many years of experience who are designated as lead teachers.

<text>Blanding () () is a city in San Juan County, Utah, United States. The population was 3,394 at the 2020 census, making it the most populated city in San Juan County. It was settled in the late 19th century by Mormon settlers, predominantly from the famed Hole-In-The-Rock expedition. Economic contributors include mineral processing, mining, agriculture, local commerce, tourism, and transportation.

Blanding is located near both the Navajo and White Mesa Ute Native American reservations and a significant percentage of Blanding&#x27;s population has family ties to these nearby cultures. Blanding is a gateway to an abundance of nearby natural and archaeological resources, including The Dinosaur Museum, Natural Bridges National Monument, Monument Valley, and the Four Corners area, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (Lake Powell), Cedar Mesa archaeological and wilderness area, the San Juan River including Goosenecks State Park, and the Needles district of Canyonlands National Park. It is located approximately 1 hour south of the popular recreation hub of Moab and Arches National Park.

Blanding is home to one of the nine statewide regional campuses of Utah State University.

==History==
First known as Grayson (after Nellie Grayson Lyman, wife of settler Joseph Lyman), the town changed its name in 1914 when a wealthy easterner, Thomas W. Bicknell, offered a thousand-volume library to any town that would adopt his name. Grayson competed with Thurber, Utah (renamed Bicknell) for the prize. Grayson was renamed Blanding after the maiden name of Bicknell&#x27;s wife, and each town received 500 books.

On the morning of June 10, 2009, sixteen Blanding residents were arrested in more than a dozen raids performed by federal agents and indicted as part of an undercover investigation of violations of the Archeological Resources Protection Act. Eight others around the Four Corners region were also indicted. The raid was the largest undercover sting of its kind in the country. The raid was the conclusion of a two-year investigation by FBI and BLM agents code-named &quot;Cerberus Action&quot; in which an undercover agent was able to purchase 256 artifacts for $335,685. One indicted resident, Dr. James DeMar Redd, died by suicide on June 11. The undercover informant, Ted Gardiner, died by suicide on March 1, 2010.

<text>Bluff () is a town in San Juan County, Utah, United States. The population was 320 at the 2000 census. Bluff incorporated in 2018. Ann Leppanen is currently the mayor.

==History==
Under the direction of John Taylor, Silas S. Smith and Danish settler Jens Nielson led about 230 Mormons on an expedition to start a farming community in southeastern Utah. After forging about 200 miles (320 kilometers) of their own trail over difficult terrain, the settlers arrived on the site of Bluff in April 1880. (The trail followed went over and down the &quot;Hole in the Rock&quot;, which now opens into one of the tributaries of Lake Powell.) The town was named for the bluffs near the town site. The town&#x27;s population had declined to seventy by 1930 but rebounded during a uranium prospecting boom in the 1950s. With the uranium decline in the 1970s, Bluff again declined and now remains a small town with about 200 residents.

<text>Monticello ( ) is a city located in San Juan County, Utah, United States and is the county seat. It is the second most populous city in San Juan County, with a population of 1,972 at the 2010 census. The Monticello area was settled in July 1887 by pioneers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Monticello, named in honor of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s estate, became the county seat in 1895 and was incorporated as a city in 1910.

Monticello, along with much of San Juan County, experienced an increase in population and economic activity during the uranium boom from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Several uranium and vanadium mines were opened in the area, and a uranium processing mill was operated in Monticello by the Federal Government from 1948 to 1960. Following the uranium boom, a massive cleanup project was conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy from 1989 to 2004 to remove radioactive material from lands and buildings and to restore the land formerly occupied by the mill.

An 18-hole golf course, The Hideout, was built near the reclaimed site of the uranium mill using DOE cleanup funding in 2000. The Hideout has been ranked the No. 2 Golf Course in Utah and the No. 23 Municipal Golf Course in the U.S.

In 1998, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated the Monticello Utah Temple, the first in a series of mini temples and the 53rd temple for the church.

Monticello rests at the base of the Abajo Mountains on the Colorado Plateau.

==History==
The Old Spanish Trail trade route passed through the area of Monticello from 1829 into the 1850s.

Monticello was one of the many cities established by Mormon pioneers in the Utah Territory, which became the State of Utah. Farming, ranching, and uranium mining have all played an important role in the economy and history of the town.

===Settlement===
Early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began the first full-scale settling of what is now known as San Juan County, Utah. Few white residents had settled along the San Juan River before the arrival of the Mormon pioneers from the San Juan Expedition. After passing through Hole-In-The-Rock, the pioneers arrived in the San Juan County area and settled in Bluff on 6 April 1880. In that year, on a journey to northern Utah from the San Juan River settlements, Apostles Erastus Snow and Brigham Young Jr. passed through the current site of Monticello. They were quite impressed by it, and this encounter was one of the key factors behind LDS settlement there a few years later. After struggling to farm along the unpredictable San Juan River, leaders began to look to settle the higher country at the base of the Abajo Mountains, also known as the Blue Mountains, where several streams and springs descended from the mountain. Piute Springs, Soldier&#x27;s Spring, and Montezuma Creek were a few of the water sources in the area named by passersby.

In March 1886, Francis A. Hammond, the LDS Stake President (the leading LDS regional authority) of San Juan County, sent scouts from Bluff to identify possible locations for settlements near the water sources of the Blue Mountains. The scouts found that a few people had already begun to utilize the land. The first white man to build a cabin in the Monticello area was likely cattleman Patrick O&#x27;Donnell in 1879. The North and South Forks of Montezuma Canyon, through which Montezuma Creek flows, were being utilized when the scouts arrived. The Kansas and New Mexico Cattle and Land Company, operated by Edmund and Harold Carlisle, was located a few miles north of what is now Monticello, and the L.C. outfit was headquartered in the South Fork of Montezuma Canyon.

Notwithstanding the fact that others were utilizing the land, Hammond sent the families of George A. Adams, Frederick I. Jones, Parley R. Butt and Charles E. Walton from Bluff to establish a new settlement at what is now Monticello. They first set up camp at Verdure near the South Fork of Montezuma Creek on March 11, 1887, six miles (10 km) south of what is now Monticello. By the first part of July 1887, the men had begun to plant crops, survey an irrigation ditch, and layout a townsite in the present-day Monticello area. Conflicts soon began with the Carlisle cowboys and Ute Indians over water and land rights, resulting in warning shots, heated disputes, and legal battles.

Learning from lawyers that the Carlisles had very little legal claim to any of the region, the Mormons claimed all the water from the South Fork and three-fourths of the water from the North Fork. In the spring of 1888, the Adams and Butt families remained in Verdure while the rest of the settlers moved to North Montezuma and began construction of the town.

Early names for the settlement were North Montezuma Creek, Piute Springs, and Hammond, after the stake president. In a formal meeting in 1888, three names were under consideration: North Montezuma, Hammond, and the biblical name, Antioch. None of the names were approved by the younger members of the community. When Hammond recommended Monticello, in honor of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s estate, everyone approved and it was accepted.

===1900 to 1940===
In 1903 the Utah State Agricultural College in Logan established an experimental station in Verdure where various dry-farming techniques were tested for thirteen years. This information spurred the growth of the farming industry in the area. In 1909, the Enlarged Homestead Act was passed, which provided of non-irrigable land for a small price. New farms began to cover the sagebrush lands north and east of Monticello. Dry farming was a major occupation in the area up through the 1930s and is a vital part of the local economy today.

The first phone lines were installed in the community in 1906, tying into Colorado circuits. The Blue Mountain Irrigation Company organized construction of a combined water and power system in 1917. The San Juan Record, the county newspaper, was established in Monticello by Oscar Walter McConkie in 1915, where it remains to this day.

===Uranium mining===
The Vanadium Corporation of America (VCA) began construction of a vanadium mill in Monticello in 1941 in response to the increased demand for radioactive material brought about by World War II. In 1943, VCA began producing a uranium-vanadium sludge for the Manhattan Engineer District. It employed 200 workers until it closed in 1946. In 1948, the U.S. Federal Government purchased the mill and reopened it in 1949 as a converted uranium and vanadium processing plant.

Monticello and the San Juan County area experienced significant growth during the uranium boom of the 1950s. The uranium mines in San Juan County were among the richest in the nation. The Happy Jack Mine, located in White Canyon, San Juan County, was founded by Monticello natives Fletch Bronson and Joe Cooper. The Happy Jack Mine was the second richest deposit of high-grade uranium ore in the nation, the first being the MiVida Mine, also in San Juan County. During these years the mill at Monticello processed large amounts of ore taken from the canyons of southeastern Utah. The population of Monticello more than doubled during this time as a result of the activity at the processing plant and the mining activity in the region. County assessed valuation jumped from $1 million in the 1940s to $132 million in 1959. Oil and mining accounted for 94 percent of the property tax in San Juan County during those years, and the San Juan School District became the state&#x27;s highest paying district.

Demand for uranium subsided in the early 1960s. On January 1, 1960, the mill was closed permanently by the Atomic Energy Commission. The mill tailings were stabilized by 1962, and the mill was dismantled in 1964.

A massive cleanup project was conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy from 1989 to 2004 to remove radioactive material from lands and buildings and to restore the land formerly occupied by the mill. All radioactive material was removed and placed in a controlled repository near Monticello. Funding was provided to restore the former mill site and roughly of surrounding land to a usable condition. In a deal with the Federal Government, the City of Monticello reseeded and restored the reclaimed land; upon completion, the city received roughly $7 million from the government.

With the remaining cleanup funds, the city decided to expand the existing 9-hole golf course into an 18-hole course. The course site is adjacent to the mill site. Longtime resident Rex Jensen donated land to the city to be used for expanding the course towards the mountain. The course was designed by Forrest Richardson &amp; Assoc. Golf Course Architects and construction was completed in 2001.

Many Monticello residents claim that the exposure to the radioactive mill tailings caused cancer in residents and mill workers. Efforts have been made and are ongoing to secure compensation for the illness or death of family members exposed to the mill tailings. In 2009, legislation was passed to provide free cancer screening to residents who lived in Monticello between 1941 and 2000.

==History==
Centerfield was first known as Skin Town. It seems that about 1880, a new method for tanning cowhides was discovered and implemented in New York. At the same time, Sanpete suffered a terrible winter with such deep snow that many cattle couldn&#x27;t find enough forage and died.
In order to keep their operations from being a total loss, the ranchers skinned the cows, used the new tanning method on the hides, and hung them out on their fences to dry. The fact that all the fences were draped with cowhides led to the name “Skin Town”. It was also called South Gunnison or Twin Town. When the town was incorporated in 1907, the residents chose the more dignified name of Centerfield because of the community&#x27;s central location.

Centerfield is an 1860s offshoot of Gunnison that evolved two miles south on US 89. Gunnison Field or Gunnison South was a natural site for farmers who worked small “squatters rights” plots of about five acres with oxen and hand plows. After the Indian troubles subsided, log and adobe houses began to appear. A late 1876 petition to ‘build a school convenient to our location’ was an early sign of independence from the mother colony. In 1882 a log cabin was built to serve as a school, church, and social hall. The 1886-87 church was built of stone, and a front tower was added in 1897. Community spirit was strong by that time, and Canute Peterson chose a committee of four who named the place for its location in the fields between Gunnison and Axtell.

===Gunnison Valley Sugar Company===
The Gunnison Valley Sugar Company built a 500-ton factory in Centerfield, Utah, in 1918. The Centerfield factory equipment came from the Washington State Sugar Company plant in Waverly, Washington. The Waverly factory, which opened in December 1899, was considered unprofitable and inferior. The Utah Sugar management, including Cutler, advised Washington Sugar in 1901 for the 1902 season, but the factory closed in 1910. It was sold to Gunnison Sugar for $100,000, installed in Centerfield in 1917, and was ready for the 1918 campaign. U-I went on an aggressive anti-competitive campaign (including spreading rumors, leading to U-I&#x27;s investigation by the FTC) against Gunnison Valley Sugar Company. In 1920, the William Wrigley Jr. Company purchased the factory to supply their chewing gum production. U-I acquired the Centerfield factory and company in 1940. They closed the factory in 1956, re-opened it from 1958 to 1961, then sold it as scrap in April 1966.

==Education==
It is in the South Sanpete School District.

<text>Fairview is a city in northern Sanpete County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,203 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Located at the confluence of the San Pitch River and Cottonwood Creek, Fairview is the largest city in the northeast end of the Sanpete Valley. Founded in 1859, soon after the resettlement of nearby Mount Pleasant, Fairview was one of the first new towns established during the second wave of Mormon settlement in Sanpete County.
Impressed with the area&#x27;s possibilities while gathering wild hay in early 1859, James Naylor Jones, Isaac Young Vance, Warren P. Brady, and Jehu Cox wrote to Brigham Young asking for permission to create a settlement. The church president responded pragmatically, &quot;If there is water for thirty families, you have my permission.&quot; At an organizing meeting held on 1 October 1859 in Mt. Pleasant, James N. Jones was chosen to lead a band of about twenty families interested in the new colonizing opportunity. The town site was surveyed, and by the end of 1860, a large log meeting house had been completed to house church, school, and social functions. Rows of poplars were planted, streets were graded, and fences were constructed as Fairview took on the appearance of the ubiquitous Mormon village. In 1864 the town obtained a post office and forsook its original name of North Bend in favor of the more descriptive name Fairview because it &quot;commands an excellent view of the great granary extending south even beyond Manti, thirty miles distant.&quot;

During the Black Hawk War of the mid-1860s, some Fairview residents moved to Mt. Pleasant for protection after a few men were killed in deadly skirmishes. Those who remained complied with Brigham Young&#x27;s instructions to build a fort. By the end of 1866, a thick rock wall ten feet high enclosed the center of town. Within a few years, the conflict diminished enough that aggressive settlement and community development commenced. In the ensuing decade, Fairview&#x27;s population burgeoned to more than 1,000, making it the fourth largest in Sanpete by 1880. In 1900 and again in 1940, the town exceeded 1,700 people; however, in 1980, the population was just 900, ranking Fairview sixth in size among the county&#x27;s nineteen communities.

Fairview shared its Mormon origin, governance and its overwhelming cultural and religious makeup with its neighboring villages. By 1880, Fairview had the smallest percentage of foreign-born, married adults (50.3 percent) of any of the major towns in a county which averaged 72.2 percent foreign-born. Initially the &quot;child&quot; of larger Mt. Pleasant six miles south, Fairview eventually became its rival, competing vigorously for land, water, timber, grazing rights, and what it considered a fair share of church and government funds. The town&#x27;s Mormon bishops sometimes found themselves in the center of bitter disputes with leaders of other communities, to the dismay of local apostle and stake president Orson Hyde, who was assigned to arbitrate disputes and settle contentions.
The people of Fairview took full part in the cooperative society of their times. In 1874 they enthusiastically followed the church council and established a united order. Stock certificates (7,500 shares) were sold at $10 a share to fund the venture. But like most of the other united orders in the territory, Fairview&#x27;s was doomed to rapid failure. Poor crops and undercapitalization nearly forced its demise in 1874 after only a few months of existence. Despite efforts to keep it alive, the order was abandoned in 1876.

From its first inception, Fairview&#x27;s economic base has depended on agriculture and the livestock industry. Following trapper Barney Ward&#x27;s lead, irrigation ditches were dug and reservoir sites identified soon after settlement. Food crops, hay, and grains were planted, and in 1870, the town&#x27;s first flour mill was constructed south of town. Livestock raising, ranging from beef and sheep to chickens and turkeys, has persisted throughout Fairview&#x27;s history. Because of its proximity to canyon forests, sawmills were established in the early decades to support the lumber industry. By the start of the 20th century, there were half a dozen steam sawmills in the mountains east of town.

Beginning in the late 1860s, Fairview developed a one-street commercial district along the old territorial road running through the middle of town. In 1869 Zion&#x27;s Cooperative Mercantile Institution was started in Fairview. Other stores and businesses followed so that by 1900 Fairview&#x27;s downtown could boast of a public library, several general stores, a furniture store, a creamery, a harness shop, a butcher shop, and two hotels. In 1881 a Presbyterian mission school was funded, with a chapel erected in 1894. A public school system was established in the 1890s; 497 of Fairview&#x27;s 1,800 population in 1898 were students. Recreational needs were accommodated in a social hall and the Eclipse Pavilion.

As was common across the American West, the arrival of the Rio Grande Western Railroad in the 1890s bolstered the town&#x27;s ability to import equipment and export its surplus goods, quickly growing Fairview&#x27;s economic strength as it did for other cities in Sanpete county. Its fortunes rose and fell with the cycle of the regional economy after the railroad-enhanced boom and its population high-water mark was reached in 1900.
The 20th century brought diverse businesses and industries, including dairies, roller mills, coal mining, and fur ranches. The Fairview State Bank was organized in 1914. In the 21st century, agriculture and livestock raising remain the dominant ways to make a living. While other parts of the county raise cattle or turkeys as the leading cash livestock, sheep ranching continues to outpace all other economies in Fairview, accounting for 46 percent of the farm and ranch operations in northeast Sanpete County.

Fairview&#x27;s architectural legacy appears in its remaining historic structures; constructed of various materials, in crafts and styles employed by Fairview&#x27;s forebears. The two 1920s-30s masonry LDS meetinghouses replaced simpler early edifices and reflect a continuing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints presence. The two-story rock school (now museum) and brick town hall indicate the town&#x27;s bygone stature. The Fairview Roller Mills is a reminder of the agrarian foundation of Fairview&#x27;s existence. Business buildings remain clustered along Main Street, while houses and outbuildings dot the blocks to the east and west. Many remnants of the rural landscape remain to identify key elements of Fairview&#x27;s history and are reflected in its present character.

<text>Gunnison is a city in the Sevier Valley in southwestern Sanpete County, Utah, United States. The population was 3,509 at the 2020 census. The city was named in honor of John W. Gunnison, a United States Army officer who surveyed for the transcontinental railroad in 1853.

==History==
===2007 gas spill===
In the summer of 2007, over of gasoline leaked from a storage tank beneath the Top Stop gas station, located on the corner of South Main and East Center and owned by Wind River Petroleum. The gasoline leaked throughout the soil beneath South Main Street and eventually throughout the southwest side of town, contaminating businesses and homes. On August 10, 2007, local and state officials ordered the temporary evacuation of an entire Main Street block, heavily populated with businesses, because of the fumes from the gasoline leak. In the weeks following, Wasatch Environmental installed underground soil-ventilation systems. Several businesses, including the Top Stop, permanently closed, and some homes were evacuated. Gunnison City, along with several businesses and residents, filed suit against Wind River Petroleum over the handling of the gas leak. As of 2010, approximately $3 million ($1 million from a state cleanup fund, $2 million from Wind River Petroleum) had been spent on the cleanup, which is expected to last a decade. Gunnison City recently completed a Main Street rehabilitation project valued at over $1 million.

<text>Manti ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Sanpete County, Utah, United States. The population was 3,429 at the 2020 United States Census.

==Description==
Manti was the first community in Utah to be settled outside the Wasatch Front and served as the hub for the formation of many other communities in Central Utah. The Manti Utah Temple, the fifth temple built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is found in Manti and dominates the area&#x27;s skyline. Manti formerly hosted the Mormon Miracle Pageant for two weeks each summer.

==History==

Manti was one of the first communities settled in what was to become Utah. Chief Walkara (or Walker), a Ute Tribe leader, invited Brigham Young to send pioneers to the area to teach his people the techniques of successful farming. In 1849, Brigham Young dispatched a company of about 225 settlers, consisting of several families, to the Sanpitch (now Sanpete) Valley. Under the direction of Isaac Morley and George Washington Bradley (1813-1891), the settlers arrived at the present location of Manti in November. They endured a severe winter by living in temporary shelters dug into the south side of the hill on which the Manti Temple now stands. Brigham Young named the new community Manti, after a city mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Manti was incorporated in 1851. The first mayor of Manti was Dan Jones. Manti served as a hub city for the settlement of other communities in the valley.

Relations with the local Native Americans deteriorated rapidly, and the Wakara’s War soon ensued. The war consisted primarily of various raids conducted by the Native Americans against Mormon outposts in Central and Southern Utah. The Walker War ended in the mid-1850s in an understanding negotiated between Brigham Young and Wakara. Shortly after that, Welcome Chapman and Wakara oversaw the baptism of scores of Wakara&#x27;s tribe members. Although immediate hostilities ended, none of the underlying conflicts were resolved.

In 1865 Utah&#x27;s Black Hawk War erupted when an incident between a Manti resident and a young chieftain exploded into open warfare between the Mormon settlers and the local Native Americans. Forts were built in Manti and other nearby communities. Smaller settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned for the duration of the war. In the fall of 1867, Chief Black Hawk made peace with the settlers, but sporadic violence occurred until 1872, when federal troops intervened. Many Mormon settlers who fought and died in the wars are buried in the Manti Cemetery. Most of the Utes were eventually relocated to the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Eastern Utah.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.1 km2), all land.

Manti has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold winters, receiving on average barely enough rainfall to avoid a semi-arid classification (&quot;BSk&quot;). Its high elevation means that the climate is cooler than other populated areas of Utah, especially during summer. Summers highs average in the mid-80s°F, with winter highs in the mid-30s°F. Winter lows, however, dip to around 15–20 °F. Pacific storms move through the region from October through May and spring is the wettest season. However, summer, which is the driest season, primarily relies on precipitation from scattered diurnal thunderstorm activity and the Gulf of California monsoon. Winter and spring see frequent snowfall. Precipitation averages 12.70 inches and snowfall 52.2 inches. The record high temperature is 110 °F (43 °C), set on August 6, 1895, while the record low is −27 °F (−33 °C), set on January 22, 1937.

Although Utah as a whole only averages 2–3 tornadoes per year, Manti was hit directly by an F2 tornado on September 8, 2002. The tornado was on the ground for 15 minutes and managed to cause $2 million in damage as it tore through southeastern Manti. No one was injured or killed in the incident.

<text>Mount Pleasant is a city in the U.S. state of Utah. Located in Sanpete County, Mt. Pleasant is known for being home to Wasatch Academy. As of the 2010 census, the city&#x27;s population was 3,260.

==History==
In the spring of 1852, Latter-Day Saint colonists from Manti led by Madison D. Hambleton established the Hambleton Settlement near the present site of Mt. Pleasant. During the Wakara War, the settlers relocated to Spring Town (Spring City), and later to Manti for protection. Local Native Americans destroyed the old settlement by setting it on fire. A large colonizing party from Ephraim and Manti returned to the area in 1859, and a permanent site was laid out in its present location. 

Among the founding settlers were Latter-Day Saint converts from Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the eastern United States. By 1880, Mt. Pleasant was the county&#x27;s largest city, with a population of 2,000. More than 72 percent of its married adults were foreign-born. This ethnic diversity had an important impact on village life during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For decades, five languages were commonly spoken in the town.

The settlement and development of Mt. Pleasant followed the typical pattern for Latter-Day Saint towns of the period. A square-shaped town site was surveyed, lots were drawn, and the land was distributed among the population. Under the direction of James Russell Ivie (1802–1866), a fort of adobe walls and log cabins was built. Pleasant Creek ran through the fort, and farming was done outside of its walls. Ivie was killed in the Ute Black Hawk War by Indians who had declined to participate in the settlement of the earlier Wakara War. Around that time, the town acquired its present name. In 1872 the final peace treaty with the Indians was signed in Bishop Seeley&#x27;s house on Main Street, bringing an end to this conflict. By this time, many settlers had erected homesteads outside of the fort. The town site may be expansive, but the population density remains relatively low, owing to the original layout that permitted only four lots per block.

Some of the first industries in Mt. Pleasant included tanning, shoe making, blacksmithing, basket making, and freighting. Eventual modernization brought such improvements as the Deseret Telegraph in 1869, the Pyramid Newspaper in 1890, and a telephone system in 1891.

Sawmills and flour mills were built, irrigation systems were dug, and a municipal government was created to oversee public laws and improvements. The city was incorporated in 1868, a year after the first cooperative store was founded. Upon the arrival of the Rio Grande Western Railway in 1890, both the local population and the city&#x27;s prosperity increased dramatically. By 1900, Mt. Pleasant had grown to nearly 3,000 people, the largest size reached by any city in Sanpete County to that time, and the city had earned one of its nicknames, &quot;Hub City&quot;.

The town&#x27;s increased wealth resulted in the replacement of small, wood-frame commercial buildings with more durable stone and brick structures, such as the Sanpete County Co-op built in 1888. Additionally, the pioneer period&#x27;s simpler adobe and log buildings were replaced with more elaborate Victorian-style churches, schools, and residences.

By 1912, the first high school, North Sanpete High School, had been completed. 1912 also brought the Armory Hall, while the Elite Theater was constructed as a &quot;fireproof&quot; building in 1913. It burned down seven decades later. In 1917, a Carnegie Library was built in a modern architectural style. The Marie Hotel was erected in 1920 and a large cheese factory was built in 1930, the same year that the bus service came to town. The completion of U.S. Highway 89 in 1936 softened the impact of the Great Depression. A city hall was built in 1939 and a hospital in 1945.

<text>Spring City is a city in Sanpete County, Utah, United States. The population was 988 at the 2010 census.

==Description==
Although it is still largely a farming town, Spring City is becoming increasingly known as an artist community. Many excellent examples of Mormon pioneer architecture exist throughout the town. In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine identified Spring City as one of the prettiest towns in America.

Orson Hyde, an early apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is buried in the Spring City Cemetery.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.3 square miles (3.5 km2), all land.

==History==

Spring City was first known as &quot;Allred Settlement&quot;. The original settlers in 1852 were under the leadership of James Allred and most of them were his family members. When an LDS ward was organized there in 1853, Ruben W. Allred was appointed the first bishop. The settlement was abandoned in the summer of 1853 because of ongoing conflict with the indigenous people of the area, the Ute people, including San Pitch Utes, from which Sanpete County derives its name. The village was reestablished as &quot;Springtown&quot; in 1859 by William Black, George Black and Joseph S. Black. Christen G. Larsen was made bishop of a new LDS ward in 1860.

Beginning in 1853, the Allred family and other church leaders began to encourage Danish immigrants to settle in Sanpete County, and, particularly after the community was reestablished in 1859, to join the Allred Settlement.

By the mid-1860s locals referred to the north side of town as &quot;Little Copenhagen&quot; or &quot;Little Denmark&quot;.

Spring City was also a site of fighting during the Black Hawk War.

As of 2018 the city&#x27;s mayor Jack Monnett is the only member of the Constitution Party to hold a mayoral seat in the US.

<text>Wales is a town in Sanpete County, Utah, United States. The population was 219 at the 2000 census. The town is governed by a mayor and several council members. As of December 2008, Wales had no stores, gas stations, or stoplights. It does have a park, fire station, library and cemetery.

==Description==
The small mining town of Wales was named for the country of the immigrants sent there by Brigham Young in 1854 to mine the &quot;rock that burns&quot;. A Native American named Tabison, a prominent Ute, had shown Young, then president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a small sample. Young recognized it as coal and asked if his group knew how to mine it. Some Welsh immigrants, including John Evans Rees and his cousin John Price, who had experience with coal mining in the U.K., volunteered and were sent to the west side hills to set up mines.

The community&#x27;s original name was Coal Bed, but was changed to Wales in 1857. There once was a railroad depot, an essential and busy mining center. The mines and trains were abandoned when more productive mines were discovered in Scofield. Many of the present residents are descendants of the original miners.

Wales lies on the west side of the Sanpete Valley, at the foot of the San Pitch Mountains.

<text>Annabella is a town in Sevier County, Utah, United States. The population was 795 at the 2010 census, an increase over the 2000 figure of 603.

==History==
The first two families to settle Omni Point in 1871 were Henry Dalton, a member of the Mormon Battalion, and Joseph Powell. Joseph Powell is undocumented and has been copied through time. The first name given to the settlement was &quot;Omni Point&quot;, because Richfield was called &quot;Omni&quot;. The &quot;Point&quot; was a high rise in the terrain, five miles directly south of Richfield. The town of Annabella was settled shortly after that, three miles to the North East of Omni Point by John Gleave and Edward Killick Roberts, along two creeks, which were named Cottonwood Creek and Annabella Springs. The town name was &quot;Annabella&quot;, after two of the first women who settled there: Ann S. Roberts and Isabella Dalton. Isabella Dalton lived at Omni Point and died in 1873, two years after settlement. There is no memorial to her burial. She was likely buried at the Omni Point homestead. Henry Dalton moved his family shortly after that to Kanosh. Several married Daltons had settled and remained in Annabella.

<text>Aurora is a city in north-central Sevier County, Utah, United States. The population was 923 in the 2020 Census.

Aurora is predominantly supported by agriculture, coal mining, and the service sector. Most residents commute to one of the neighboring communities to work. Children go to school at one of the three schools in Salina Utah. The current growth in the community is attributed to the growth of business and industry in the region.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Aurora has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
Aurora was founded in 1875 by Ezra White (or Ezra Curtis, according to some accounts) and three other families along the banks of the Sevier River. Three men came along and discovered the land. They went back to Provo and started to settle back in 1875, They settled on the bend of the Sevier River, and it had a bunch of Willow trees, so they chose the name Willowbend. The name was changed to Aurora due to the presence of the Northern Lights . It also changed because the colors reminded the Postmaster of the Roman Goddess of dawn. The city was moved west two to three miles along the Rocky Ford Canal to avoid the spring flooding accompanying life along the Sevier. This location also enabled significant cultivation of the foothills. Those families that settled in the region often left the comfortable surroundings of Northern Utah to settle in what one original resident described as a desolate region without a green tree in sight. Over time, however, settlers planted crops, and trees and utilized irrigation to create a very beautiful and livable community.

Nestled in the fertile Sevier Valley, Aurora slowly grew as more settlers moved west. While growth occurred more rapidly in the accompanying communities of Salina and Richfield, Aurora grew largely due to the settling of children of many of the large families in the city. Most current residents can track their lineage to one of the four founding families of the city.

Helsingør, the city where Kronborg Castle is located, is classically known as Elsinore as well.

The first passenger train arrived on July 21, 1896, from the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad.

Elsinore was home to a Utah-Idaho Sugar Company factory for processing sugar beets into sugar from 1911 to 1929, but was closed due to a sugar beet blight.

On September 29 and October 1, 1921, Elsinore was hit by a series of magnitude six earthquakes. Some buildings were damaged, and residents were frightened from their homes, but no deaths were reported.

<text>Glenwood is a town in Sevier County, Utah, United States. The population was 464 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Glenwood was established in 1863 by Mormon pioneers. It was named for an early pioneer, Robert Wilson Glenn. The settlement&#x27;s original name was Glencoe or Glen Cove but was changed in November 1864 when Orson Hyde (an LDS Church leader) visited the settlement and recommended Glenwood. A stone fort was constructed in April 1866.
The Black Hawk War of 1867 between the settlers and the local Indians left Glenwood deserted for one year, but it was later resettled in 1868 after peace resumed.

Glenwood was an excellent site for a settlement, owing to fresh springs that naturally bubbled from the hills east of town. The springs still feed Glenwood&#x27;s culinary water supply and supply water for the State of Utah fish hatchery southeast of town. A gristmill was built in Glenwood that became the first of its kind in the county.

A ZCMI co-operative building was built at the intersection of Main and Center streets in 1878. For several years it was the largest building in the county. As families moved out of Glenwood, Isaac Washington Pierce Jr., a resident of Glenwood, bought out all shares in the store and ran the store as a privately owned business for many years.(). It still stands as the main historical landmark in town, although it is currently abandoned.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.5 square mile (1.4 km2), all land. The ZIP Code for the town is 84730.

The Mill Canyon-Sage Flat Watershed Project located in the drainage above Glenwood is designed to reduce flood damage in the area. Completed in 1959, this was the first project in the United States under the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act. A major flood occurred during the final stages of completion, and residents claimed the project paid for itself by controlling this one flood.

===Climate===

==History==
In late 1863, a few exploratory settlers came to Monroe. This small group included George Wilson, his son David, and two others who were seeking to settle in this valley. They made a dugout and spent the winter at what is now considered near the center of the town. They were followed by the first permanent group of settlers, who arrived in Monroe on 20 February 1864. Most, if not all, of the first Settlers were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), who had immigrated to Utah. Around 4 to 5 months before the first small group of men entered Monroe valley to begin settlement, an advanced team, also led by George Wilson, began to lay some foundation work to help prepare the settlement.

At first the town was called South Bend (due to the proximity to a bend in the Sevier River), but soon after its settlement it was renamed Alma, in honor of the Book of Mormon prophet. It is estimated that by the end of 1864 around 20 families were living in Alma. They spent the first year building small homes and dugouts, along with clearing space for fields and pastures.

Initially settling in the Salt Lake Valley did not provoke the Native Americans to war, but further settlement outside of Salt Lake provoked the Native Americans to more aggressive behavior. As settlement in these valleys increased, the Native Americans were pushed back into the mountains. In April 1865, the Black Hawk War broke out between local Native Americans and the Settlers of both the Sevier and Sanpete counties. The war drastically ended the progress which was being made in creating farms and homes in and around Alma. On the night of 21 April 1866, Walter Barney and Sidney Robinson were on guard watching the public corral when they spotted something lying on the fence when making their nightly rounds. When approached, they realized that it was two Native Americans. After chasing them away, they went back to the fence and realized that they had been digging around the poles to break the boundary around the corral.

Alma had been settled in the middle of the Native Americans’ hunting grounds and as a result they started to go hungry. During the war Native Americans were constantly trying to steal the Settler&#x27;s stock for food, and they were successful during several raids.

Sometime during 1865, work began on a fort to provide protection for both the Settlers and their stock. The fort was completed and contained several homes, a blacksmith shop, along with a corral and stockyard for the animals. This fort, named Fort Alma, provided protection for about two years, but things continued to get more dangerous and in April 1867 the Settlers of Alma were evacuated. Most of the evacuees made temporary homes in Sanpete County, until they could return home.

An attempt to resettle Alma was made during 1868, but the Settlers ran into Native Americans near Cedar Ridge (now Vermillion, Utah) and a battle ensued. They were unsuccessful in resettling Alma, and it was not until March 1871 that Settlers were finally able to return to Alma. The following year they applied for a Post Office under the city name of Monroe, in honor of U.S. President James Monroe. By the end of 1872 the telegraph had been extended through Monroe, which connected it with the rest of Utah. In 1889, Monroe was incorporated as a town and remained that way until 1921, when it was incorporated as a city.

In 1882, Thomas Cooper and his wife homesteaded the area on the east side of town where hot springs water emerged. They built a wood box to collect the water and offered it as a soaking pool. Later, around 1905, a building was erected. There was a dance floor, an indoor swimming pool, and many dressing rooms. Many people came from miles around by horse and buggy to enjoy soaking and dancing. In 1930 Farnsworth bought the hot springs. He was the leader of a band, and it became the house band. The slogan for the Monroe hot springs was, &quot;the home of mirth and merriment&quot;. The hot springs enjoyed many years of prosperity until around 1950. It was revitalized in the 1970s. The name was changed to Mystic Hot Springs in 1995.

=== Present day ===

Monroe has many subdivisions and is nicknamed &quot;The Little Green Valley&quot; due to the many fields that surround the city.

==Education==

The schools for most of the surrounding areas are also located in Monroe, which has Monroe Elementary (K-5), South Sevier Middle School (6-8), and South Sevier High School (9-12). School-age children are traditionally bused from the neighboring towns of Central Valley, Annabella, Elsinore, Joseph, and Sevier to Monroe to attend school.

Over 50 Latter-Day Saint churchgoers were reported to be sickened from carbon monoxide poisoning at the LDS Monroe East chapel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Sevier County, Utah, on December 31, 2023, New Year&#x27;s Eve, as reported by the Sevier County Sheriff’s office. The sheriff reported they were transported to a local hospital for treatment. It was determined that the heating system malfunctioned, causing a release of carbon monoxide into the chapel, where services were being held. Carbon monoxide poisoning at the Monroe Latter-day Saint chapel in Utah led to 22 hospitalizations on Sunday, and 54 people experienced symptoms of poisoning, and 49 were treated. 

The local fire department checked the building for carbon monoxide, and high levels were discovered and the building was evacuated. Members who re-entered the building continued to experience poisoning symptoms and were transported for medical care. 22 individuals required hospitalization and 10 ambulance transports were required to evacuate victims to a local hospital that had a hyperbaric chamber that could treat the patients. The church made a public statement that the building would be checked and the heating system repaired.

<doc id="137109" wikidata="Q244689" url="?curid=137109" title="Lal Bahadur Shastri">
<text>Lal Bahadur Shastri (; born Lal Bahadur Srivastava; 2 October 190411 January 1966) was an Indian politician and statesman who served as the prime minister of India from 1964 to 1966. He previously served as home minister from 1961 to 1963.

Shastri was born to Sharad Prasad Srivastava and Ramdulari Devi in Mughalsarai (present-day Uttar Pradesh) on 2 October 1904. He studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation movement. He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his caste-derived surname of &quot;Srivastava&quot;. Shastri&#x27;s thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and influenced by Gandhi, he joined the Indian Independence movement in the 1920s. He served as the president of Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent positions in the Indian National Congress (INC). Following independence in 1947, he joined the Indian government and became one of prime minister Nehru&#x27;s key cabinet colleagues, first as railways minister (1951–56), and then in numerous other prominent positions, including the home ministry.

As prime minister, Shastri promoted the White Revolution – a national campaign to increase the production and supply of milk – by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating the National Dairy Development Board. Underlining the need to boost India&#x27;s food production, Shastri also promoted the Green Revolution in India in 1965. This led to an increase in food grain production, especially in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. He led the country during the Second India–Pakistan War. His slogan &quot;Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan&quot; (&quot;Hail to the soldier; Hail to the farmer&quot;) became very popular during the war. The war formally ended with the Tashkent Declaration on 10 January 1966; Shastri died the next day.

==Early years (1904–1920)==
Shastri was born on 2 October 1904 at the home of his maternal grandparents. Shastri&#x27;s paternal ancestors were in the service of the &quot;zamindar&quot; of Ramnagar in Banaras, and Shastri lived there for the first year of his life. Shastri&#x27;s father, Sharad Prasad Srivastava, was a school teacher who later became a clerk in the revenue office at Prayagraj, while his mother, Ramdulari Devi, was the daughter of Munshi Hazari Lal, the headmaster and English teacher at a railway school in Mughalsarai. Shastri was the second child and eldest son of his parents; he had an elder sister, Kailashi Devi (b. 1900).

In April 1906, when Shastri was hardly 18 months old, his father, who had only recently been promoted to the post of deputy tehsildar, died in an epidemic of bubonic plague. Ramdulari Devi, then only 23 years old and pregnant with her third child, took her two children and moved from Ramnagar to her father&#x27;s house in Mughalsarai and settled there for good. She gave birth to a daughter, Sundari Devi, in July 1906. Thus, Shastri and his sisters grew up in the household of his maternal grandfather, Hazari Lalji. However, Hazari Lalji himself died from a stroke in mid-1908. Thereafter, the family was looked after by his brother (Shastri&#x27;s great-uncle) Darbari Lal, who was the head clerk in the opium regulation department at Ghazipur, and later by his son (Ramdulari Devi&#x27;s cousin) Bindeshwari Prasad, a school teacher in Mughalsarai.

This situation was fairly standard for the time, where the Indian joint family system was a thriving reality; the sense of family relationship and responsibility it fostered was the primary social security of the time. Nor should it be surmised from these circumstances that Shastri grew up in an under-privileged manner, or that his education and comforts were compromised. On the contrary, since he was a rank student, he received a better education than some of his cousins. Bindeshwari Prasad, on the limited salary of a school teacher, with many dependents, nevertheless managed to give a good education to all the children in his care.

In 1917, Bindeshwari Prasad was transferred to Varanasi, and the entire family moved there, including Ramdulari Devi and her three children. In Varanasi, Shastri joining the seventh standard at Harish Chandra High School.

==Early activities (1921–1945)==
While his family had no links to the independence movement then taking shape, among his teachers at Harish Chandra High School was an intensely patriotic and highly respected teacher named Nishkameshwar Prasad Mishra, who gave Shastri much-needed financial support by allowing him to tutor his children. Inspired by Mishra&#x27;s patriotism, Shastri took a deep interest in the freedom struggle, and began to study its history and the works of several of its noted personalities, including those of Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. In January 1921, when Shastri was in the 10th standard and three months from sitting the final examinations, he attended a public meeting in Benares hosted by Gandhi and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. Inspired by the Mahatma&#x27;s call for students to withdraw from government schools and join the non-cooperation movement, Shastri withdrew from Harish Chandra High School the next day and joined the local branch of the Congress Party as a volunteer, actively participating in picketing and anti-government demonstrations. He was soon arrested and jailed, but was then let off as he was still a minor.

Shastri&#x27;s immediate supervisor was a former Benares Hindu University lecturer named J.B. Kripalani, who would become one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement and one among Gandhi&#x27;s closest followers. Recognising the need for the younger volunteers to continue their educations, Kripalani and a friend, V.N. Sharma, had founded an informal school centered around &quot;nationalist education&quot; to educate the young activists in their nation&#x27;s heritage and with the support of a wealthy philanthropist and ardent Congress nationalist, Shiv Prasad Gupta, the Kashi Vidyapith was inaugurated by Gandhi in Benares as a national institution of higher education on 10 February 1921. Among the first students of the new institution, Shastri graduated with a first-class degree in philosophy and ethics from the Vidyapith in 1925. He was given the title &quot;Shastri&quot; (&quot;scholar&quot;). The title was a bachelor&#x27;s degree awarded by the institution but it stuck as part of his name.

Shastri enrolled himself as a life member of the Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai, and began to work for the betterment of the Harijans under Gandhi&#x27;s direction at Muzaffarpur. Later he became the President of the Society.

===Independence Activism of Lal Bahadur Shastri===
In 1928 Shastri became an active and mature member of the Indian National Congress at the call of Mahatma Gandhi. He was imprisoned for two and a half years. Later, he worked as the Organizing Secretary of the Parliamentary Board of U.P. in 1937. In 1940, he was sent to prison for one year, for offering individual Satyagraha support to the independence movement.

On 8 August 1942, Mahatma Gandhi issued the Quit India speech at Gowalia Tank in Bombay, demanding that the British leave India. Shastri, who had just then come out after a year in prison, travelled to Allahabad. For a week, he sent instructions to the independence activists from Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s home, Anand Bhavan. He served as an elected representative for United Provinces in 1937 and 1946.

==Political Career (1947–1964)==
===State minister===
Following India&#x27;s independence, Shastri was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in his home state, Uttar Pradesh. He became the Minister of Police and Transport under Govind Ballabh Pant&#x27;s Chief Ministership on 15 August 1947 following Rafi Ahmed Kidwai&#x27;s departure to become a minister at the centre. As the Transport Minister, he was the first to appoint women conductors. As the minister in charge of the Police Department, he ordered that police use water jets, whose instructions was given by him, instead of lathis to disperse unruly crowds. His tenure as police minister (As Home Minister was called prior to 1950) saw successful curbing of communal riots in 1947, mass migration and resettlement of refugees.

===Cabinet minister===
In 1951, Shastri was made the General Secretary of the All-India Congress Committee with Jawaharlal Nehru as the prime minister. He was directly responsible for the selection of candidates and the direction of publicity and electioneering activities. He played an important role in the landslide successes of the Congress Party in the Indian General Elections of 1952, 1957 and 1962. In 1952, he successfully contested UP Vidhansabha from Soraon North cum Phulpur West seat and won by getting over 69% of vote. He was believed to be retained as home minister of UP, but in a surprise move was called to Centre as minister by Nehru. Shastri was made Minister of Railways and Transport in First Cabinet of Republic of India on 13 May 1952.

In September 1956 he wanted to take political and moral responsibility for the 1956 Mahbubnagar train accident and offered his resignation as the Minister of Railways to prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, but he refused. After the 1956 Ariyalur train accident, a similar accident about 2.5 months later, Shastri again offered his resignation and was accepted this time. He resigned as Railway minister on 7 December 1956.

He served as the Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1959 and Minister of Home Affairs in 1961. Shastri laid the foundation of Mangalore Port in 1964 as a minister without a portfolio.

==Prime minister (1964–1966)==

Jawaharlal Nehru died in office on 27 May 1964. Then Congress Party president K. Kamaraj was instrumental in making Shastri prime minister on 9 June. Shastri, though mild-mannered and soft-spoken, was a Nehruvian socialist and thus held appeal to those wishing to prevent the ascent of conservative right-winger Morarji Desai.

In his first broadcast as prime minister, on 11 June 1964, Shastri stated:

===Domestic policies===
Shastri retained many members of Nehru&#x27;s Council of Ministers. T. T. Krishnamachari was retained as the Finance Minister of India, as was Defence Minister Yashwantrao Chavan. Further, He appointed Swaran Singh to succeed him as External Affairs Minister. He also appointed Indira Gandhi, daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru and former Congress President, as the Minister of Information and Broadcasting. Gulzarilal Nanda continued as the Minister of Home Affairs.

Lal Bahadur Shastri&#x27;s tenure witnessed the Madras anti-Hindi agitation of 1965. The government of India had for a long time made an effort to establish Hindi as the sole national language of India. This was resisted by the non-Hindi speaking states particularly Madras State. To calm the situation, Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri&#x27;s assurance, as did the student agitation.

===Economic policies===

Shastri continued Nehru&#x27;s socialist economic policies with central planning. He promoted the White Revolution – a national campaign to increase the production and supply of milk – by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating the National Dairy Development Board. He visited Anand on 31 October 1964 for inauguration of the Cattle Feed Factory of Amul at Kanjari. As he was keenly interested in knowing the success of this co-operative, he stayed overnight with farmers in a village, and even had dinner with a farmer&#x27;s family. He discussed his wish with Verghese Kurien, then the General Manager of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers&#x27; Union Ltd (Amul) to replicate this model to other parts of the country for improving the socio-economic conditions of farmers. As a result of this visit, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was established at Anand in 1965.

While speaking on the chronic food shortages across the country, Shastri urged people to voluntarily give up one meal so that the food saved could be distributed to the affected populace. However, he ensured that he first implemented the system in his own family before appealing to the country. He went on air to appeal to his countrymen to skip a meal a week. The response to his appeal was overwhelming. Even restaurants and eateries downed the shutters on Monday evenings. Many parts of the country observed the &quot;Shastri Vrat&quot;. He motivated the country to maximize the cultivation of food grains by ploughing the lawn himself, at his official residence in New Delhi. During the 22-day war with Pakistan in 1965, On 19 October 1965, Shastri gave the seminal &#x27;Jai Jawan Jai Kishan&#x27; (&quot;Hail the soldier, Hail the farmer&quot;) slogan at Urwa in Allahabad that became a national slogan. Underlining the need to boost India&#x27;s food production, Shastri also promoted the Green Revolution in India in 1965. This led to an increase in food grain production, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Major milestones in this undertaking were the development of high-yielding varieties of wheat, and rust resistant strains of wheat.

Though he was a socialist, Shastri stated that India cannot have a regimented type of economy. His government passed the National Agricultural Products Board Act and was responsible for setting up the Food Corporation of India under the Food Corporation&#x27;s Act 1964.

===Jai Jawan Jai Kisan===

For the outstanding slogan given by him during the Indo-Pak war of 1965, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India) commemorated Shastri 47 years after his death on his 48th martyr&#x27;s day:

===Foreign policy===
Shastri continued Nehru&#x27;s policy of non-alignment but also built closer relations with the Soviet Union. In the aftermath of the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the formation of military ties between China and Pakistan, Shastri&#x27;s government decided to expand the country&#x27;s defence budget.
In 1964, Shastri signed an accorresponsibilities of local governments to provide adequate facilities to shelter the repatriates upon disembarkation on Indian soil. Particularly in the Madras State the Chief Minister during that time, Minjur K. Bhaktavatsalam, showed care in rehabilitation of the returnees. In December 1965, Shastri made an official visit with his family to Rangoon, Burma and re-established cordial relations with the country&#x27;s military government of General Ne Win.

===War with Pakistan===

Laying claim to half the Kutch peninsula, the Pakistani army skirmished with Indian forces in August 1965. In his report to the Lok Sabha on the confrontation in Kutch, Shastri stated:

On 1 August 1965, major incursions of militants and Pakistani soldiers began, hoping not only to break down the government but incite a sympathetic revolt. The revolt did not happen, and India sent its forces across the Ceasefire Line (now Line of Control) and threatened Pakistan by crossing the International Border near Lahore as war broke out on a general scale. Massive tank battles occurred in the Punjab, and while the Pakistani forces made gains in the northern part of subcontinent, Indian forces captured the key post at Haji Pir, in Kashmir, and brought the Pakistani city of Lahore under artillery and mortar fire.

The India-Pakistan war ended on 23 September 1965 with a United Nations-mandated ceasefire. In a broadcast to the nation on the day of the ceasefire, Shastri stated:

During his tenure as prime minister, Shastri visited many countries including the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, England, Canada, Nepal, Egypt and Burma. In October 1964 while returning from the Non Alliance Conference in Cairo, on the invitation of the-then president of Pakistan, Muhammad Ayub Khan, to have lunch with him, Shastri made a stopover at Karachi Airport for a few hours. Breaking with protocol, Ayub Khan personally received him at the airport and they had an informal meeting.

After the ceasefire with Pakistan in 1965, Shastri and Ayub Khan attended a summit in Tashkent (former USSR, now in modern Uzbekistan), organized by Alexei Kosygin. On 10 January 1966, Shastri and Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Declaration which formally ended the war.

==Family and personal life==
Shastri was 5 ft 2 inches tall and always used to wear a &quot;dhoti&quot;. The only occasion on which he wore &quot;pyjamas&quot; was a dinner in honor of the Queen of the United Kingdom in 1961 in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. On 16 May 1928, Shastri married Lalita Devi who was from Mirzapur. The couple had four sons and two daughters. Hari Krishna Shastri is the eldest son; The eldest daughter is Kusum Shastri. Suman Shastri is the next eldest, whose son, Siddharth Nath Singh is a spokesman of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Minister of Health, Government of Uttar Pradesh. Anil Shastri is the youngest and is a member of his father&#x27;s Congress Party; his son Adarsh Shastri gave up his corporate career with Apple Inc to contest the General elections of 2014 from Prayagraj on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket. He lost that election but was elected in 2015 as a member of the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Sunil Shastri who is a member of the Indian National Congress and Ashok Shastri, the youngest son who worked in the corporate world before his death at the age of 37, his wife Neera Shastri was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party national executive. Other members of the family, have also been involved in the corporate and social life of India.

==Death==

Shastri died due to heart attack in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (then in the Soviet Union) on 11 January 1966, one day after signing a peace treaty to end the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War. Many of Shastri&#x27;s supporters and close relatives refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe the circumstances of his death, instead alleging foul play. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death, and have thereafter persisted. A movie named The Tashkent Files was made on the topic of his death. An RTI was filed to Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (India), office responded that it has one file on his death but cannot declassify it to the public. Many people still believe that he was poisoned. He was eulogized as a national hero; the Vijay Ghat memorial was established in his memory. Upon his death, Gulzarilal Nanda once again assumed the role of acting prime minister, until the Congress Party elected Indira Gandhi over Morarji Desai to officially succeed Shastri.

** Bharat Ratna (1966, posthumous)

===Freedom of the City===
* Belgrade, Yugoslavia:
**Honorary Citizenship of Belgrade (1965)

==Legacy==
Shastri is regarded as one of the most respected prime ministers of India. He was a secularist who refused to mix religion with politics. In a public meeting held at the Ram Lila grounds in Delhi, a few days after the ceasefire, he complained about a BBC report which claimed that Shastri&#x27;s identity as a Hindu meant that he was ready for a war with Pakistan. He stated:

:&quot;While I am a Hindu, Mir Mushtaq who is presiding over this meeting is a Muslim. Mr. Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, &quot;gurdwaras&quot; and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics. This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose, and worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.&quot;

Kuldip Nayar, Shastri&#x27;s media advisor from 1960 to 1964, recalls that, during the Quit India Movement, his daughter was ill and he was released on parole from jail. However, he could not save her life because doctors had prescribed costly drugs. Later on in 1963, on the day when he was dropped from the cabinet, he was sitting in his home in the dark, without a light. When asked about the reason, he said as he no longer is a minister, all expenses will have to be paid by himself and that as an MP and minister he didn&#x27;t earn enough to save for times of need.

Although Shastri had been a cabinet minister for many years in the 1950s, he was poor when he died. All he owned at the end was an old car, which he had bought in installments from the government and for which he still owed money. He was a member of the Servants of India society (which included Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhle) which asked all its members to shun accumulation of private property and remain in public life as servants of the people. He was the first railway minister who resigned from office following a major train accident as he felt moral responsibility.

The foundation stone of Bal Vidya Mandir, a distinguished school of Lucknow, was laid by him during his tenure as the prime minister, on 19 November 1964. He inaugurated the Central Institute of Technology Campus at Tharamani, Chennai, in November 1964. He inaugurated the Plutonium Reprocessing Plant at Trombay in 1965. As suggested by Dr. Homi Jehangir Bhabha, Shastri authorized the development of nuclear explosives. Bhabha initiated the effort by setting up the nuclear explosive design group Study of Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes (SNEPP). He inaugurated the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University at Hyderabad on 20 March 1965 which was renamed the Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in 1996 and was separated into two universities after the formation of Telangana State. The university in Telangana was named in July 2014 as Professor Jayashanker Agricultural University. Shastri also inaugurated the National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. Lal Bahadur Shastri inaugurated the Jawahar Dock of the Chennai Port Trust and started the construction work of V.O. Chidambaranar Port Authority in November 1964. He inaugurated the Sainik School Balachadi, in the state of Gujarat. He laid the foundation stone of Almatti dam. The commissioned dam bears his name.
===Memorials===
Shastri was known for his honesty and humility throughout his life. He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, and a memorial &quot;Vijay Ghat&quot; was built for him in Delhi. Several educational institutes including Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (Mussorie, Uttarakhand) bear his name. The Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management was established in Delhi by the Lal Bahadur Shastri Educational Trust in 1995. The Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute was named after Shastri due to his role in promoting scholarly activity between India and Canada. &quot;Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial&quot; run by the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Memorial Trust, is situated next to 10 Janpath his residence when he was prime minister, at 1, Motilal Nehru Place, New Delhi. One of the halls of residence of IIT Kharagpur is named after him as &quot;Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence&quot;.

In 2011, on Shastri&#x27;s 45th death anniversary, the Uttar Pradesh Government announced the renovation of Shastri&#x27;s ancestral house at Ramnagar in Varanasi and declared plans to convert it into a biographical museum. Varanasi International Airport is named after him. The Lal Bahadur Shastri Centre for Indian Culture with a monument and a street named after him are in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan. A few stadiums are named after him in the cities of Hyderabad, Telangana, Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Kollam in Kerala, Ghazhiabad and Bhawanipatna in Odisha. The Almatti Dam across the River Krishna in northern Karnataka was renamed the Lal Bahadur Shastri Sagar. The foundation stone was laid by him. MV Lal Bahadur Shastri, a cargo ship, is named after him. The Reserve Bank of India released coins in the denomination of 5 rupees during his birth century celebrations. An All India Lal Bahadur Shastri Hockey tournament has been held every year since 1991 – it is a major hockey tournament. The Left Bank Canal of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam in Andhra Pradesh is named the Lal Bahadur Shastri Canal and is 295 km in Length.
Some major roads in the cities of New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Puduchery, Lucknow, Warangal and Allahabad and Ernakulam are named after him, as is Sashtri Road, Kottayam, Kerala. There is a Lal Bahadur Shastri Medical College in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh and Shastri Bhavans in New Delhi, Chennai and Lucknow. In 2005, the Government of India created a chair in his honour in the field of democracy and governance at Delhi University.

A portrait of Shastri hangs in the Central Hall of the Parliament House of India. The portrait, painted by Vidya Bhushan, was unveiled by the then President of India, Dr. Shanker Dayal Sharma on 2 October 1993.

==In popular culture==
Shastri&#x27;s life and death, in particular, have been a subject of Indian popular culture. &quot;Homage to Lal Bahadur Shastri&quot; is a 1967 short documentary film directed by S. Sukhdev and produced by the Films Division of India which pays tribute to the former prime minister. &quot;Apne Shastri Ji&quot; (1986) was also made as a homage to him.

&quot;Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan&quot; is a 2015 Indian Hindi-language biographical drama film by Milan Ajmera, titled after the popular slogan by Shastri it portrays his entire life from birth to death where he is portrayed by Akhilesh Jain. &quot;Lal Bahadur Shastri&#x27;s Death&quot;, a 2018 television documentary film by Jyoti Kapur Das reconstructs his death and covers various conspiracy theories around it, including interviews with his son Sunil Shastri. A film titled &quot;The Tashkent Files&quot; (2019), directed by Vivek Agnihotri revolves around the mystery of the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri.

&quot;Pradhanmantri&quot; (), a 2013 Indian documentary television series which aired on ABP News and covers the various policies and political tenures of Indian PMs, dedicated the entire seventh episode &quot;Lal Bahadur Shastri&quot; to his term as the country&#x27;s leader with Akhil Mishra in the role of Shastri.

The 1967 Bollywood film &quot;Upkar&quot; by Manoj Kumar, which is based on the 1965 war, was dedicated to Shastri. It also eulogised him in the song &quot;Mere Desh Ki Dharti&quot; when the hero exclaims, &quot;Rang Lal hai Lal Bahadur se&quot;. &quot;Lal Bahadur Shastri&quot;, a 2014 Indian Malayalam-language comedy film by Rejishh Midhila is titled after the prime minister but has no apparent connection with his life.

<text>Richfield is a city in and the county seat of Sevier County, Utah, United States, and is the largest city in southern-central Utah.

==Description==
As of the 2020 census, the city population was 8,201. It lies in the Mormon Corridor, just off Interstate 70, approximately east of its junction with Interstate 15. The county can be best described as &quot;rural diversified&quot; due to the convergence of agricultural, retail and industrial activities. Richfield has developed as a regional tourist center because it is located on the interstate freeway about halfway between Los Angeles, California and Denver, Colorado, attracting many automobile travelers who stop at the city.

Richfield is remote from larger cities, about or more in any direction from more populous towns such as Salt Lake City, while dozens of smaller communities are found in the general area. Some examples are Sigurd, Venice, Glenwood, and Central Valley. Its remoteness, plus its location on major transportation corridors, makes it central Utah&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; regional capital, a shopping and &quot;commercial capital of a vast mountain-valley region.&quot; Many people from the region drive to Richfield to shop, bowl, golf, to attend theater, concerts, or for religious gatherings. They are also drawn to the community college, affiliated with Snow College, and go there to receive medical care. Richfield is part of &quot;Panoramaland;&quot; it is on the thoroughfare to several nearby national parks and national forests.

==History==
Prehistoric people occupied the Richfield area for more than 7,000 years. Fremont culture remains are found near most community sites in the Sevier area. They are dated from approximately 1 BC to 1000 BC. In the late summer of 1776, Father Escalante and his party of Spanish explorers passed through the general vicinity, looking for a trail to link Nuevo Mexico and California. During the late 1820s, Jedediah Smith and other fur traders crossed the area. Sevier County lay on one of the variants on the Old Spanish Trail between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and California and was used by travelers between 1830 and 1850.

In early January 1864, a party of ten men under the leadership of Albert Lewis came from Sanpete County, Utah, and arrived in what is now Richfield. The Mormon settlers found fertile soil, good water, and wood in the nearby hills. They decided that it was a desirable site for a settlement. These pioneers made a dwelling place for all ten men, which they called &#x27;The Hole in the Ground.&#x27; They carefully covered this hole with brush willows and other materials and made a crude chimney of rocks. This dugout was located on today&#x27;s Main Street. These men spent the remainder of the winter in this dwelling, planning and preparing for when they could bring their families.

The early Mormon settlements were abandoned in 1867 due to the conflict known as the Black Hawk War. But, when resettled in 1871, Richfield grew to become a regional center. The coming of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1891 opened the valley for expanded agricultural commerce and mining.

In 1939, Utah Governor Henry H. Blood vetoed a proposal for a junior college in Richfield. Fifty-seven years later, Snow College opened a Richfield campus, which serves about 600 students annually.

==Religion==
As in most settled areas of rural Utah, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) plays a prominent role. The Mormons were highly industrious settlers. From 1847, when they founded Salt Lake City, until 1877, they founded 360 towns. Following direction from Brigham Young, Latter-day Saints founded the town and outlying hamlets about 150 years ago. Members of the LDS Church are predominant among the residents.

Even in this heart of Mormon country, non-Mormons and non-participating Mormons, the latter euphemistically called &quot;less-actives,&quot; fill a percentage of elected offices. Due largely to combined influences of conservative rural culture and the Latter-day Saints, the voters of the city and the surrounding county are predominately Republican.

The Richfield area has 20 major denominational churches including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, First Baptist Church, Sister of Holy Cross, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, Assembly of God, and others.

<text>Salina ( ) is a city in Sevier County, Utah, United States. The population was 2,660 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first permanent settlers (about 30 families) moved into the area in 1864 at the direction of leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They found abundant salt deposits nearby so they named the area &quot;Salina&quot;.

In 1866, troubles with Native Americans who used the area as their hunting ground (the Black Hawk War (Utah)) forced the white settlers to retreat to the Manti area. They returned to Salina in 1871, organized a militia, and constructed a fort and buildings for a school and a church. At that time they discovered coal deposits in &quot;almost inexhaustible quantities&quot; in the canyon east of the settlement.

A creek north of the settlement was tapped to provide water for irrigation, domestic purposes, and to power various enterprises such as sawmills, grist mills, salt refineries and generation of electricity. The Sevier River was tapped in 1874, and by 1908 the area west of the settlement was being fully cultivated.

In June 1891, the settlement was connected to the state&#x27;s railroad system, and that year the central area was incorporated as a town. It soon became the shipping terminal between the area settlements and the rest of the state. In 1913 the town was re-incorporated as a city.

During World War II, Salina contained a POW camp, housing 250 German prisoners, most of them members of Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrikakorps. On the night of July 8, 1945, Private Clarence Bertucci climbed one of the guard towers and took aim at the tents where the prisoners were sleeping. He fired 250 rounds from a light machine gun and managed to hit some thirty tents in his fifteen-second rampage. By the time a corporal managed to disarm Bertucci, six prisoners were dead and an additional twenty-two were wounded (three later died of their wounds).

This incident was called the Salina Massacre. Bertucci, who was from New Orleans, was declared insane and spent the remainder of his life in an institution.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.2 square miles (15.9 km2), all land.

===Climate===
Salina&#x27;s annual precipitation averages around 7.82 inches (20 cm), which causes the area to be classified as desert.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,393 people, 808 households, and 631 families residing in the city. The population density was 388.9 people per square mile (150.2/km2). There were 878 housing units at an average density of 142.7 per square mile (55.1/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 96.66% White, 1.17% Native American, 0.13% Asian, 0.17% Pacific Islander, 0.75% from other races, and 1.13% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.30% of the population.

There were 808 households, out of which 45.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.6% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.8% were non-families. 19.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.96 and the average family size was 3.41.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 35.2% under the age of 18, 10.9% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 17.3% from 45 to 64, and 12.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $34,886, and the median income for a family was $38,816. Males had a median income of $32,204 versus $16,250 for females. The per capita income for the city was $12,967. About 10.4% of families and 13.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.5% of those under age 18 and 7.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
The primary effort of the first settlers was agriculture, primarily to sustain themselves. However, other commercial activities were soon started. In the 1870s a telegraph line, regular postal service, and coal mines were operating.

In June 1891 a railway began operating to the area, and soon the town was the transportation terminus between the area and the rest of Utah, which caused a boom in the town&#x27;s businesses and its population size. By the end of the nineteenth century the town had a newspaper (the Central Utah Press), a city hall and library, and an eight-room elementary schoolhouse, along with a plethora of saloons, boarding houses and dancehalls.

During the Great Depression a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established in the area east of Salina, and its attendees worked on dams, roads and recreation sites. Federal agency funding was used to construct a new city hall and library, an improved culinary water system, and a citywide wastewater collection/disposal system.

In the 1940s the Salina Livestock Auction and the Salina Turkey Plant (now part of Norbest) were established, both of which are still operating . The Convulsion Canyon mine continued to grow, and became a part of Arch Coal, Inc., known as the SUFCO Mine. SUFCO is currently owned by Bowie Resource Partners.

Salina is currently attempting to develop a 400-acre (162-hectare) commercial site south of town, at the intersection of I-70 and US 89. The effort is being funded by the city and by a grant from the US Economic Development Administration. It consists of 50 lots ranging from 1.5 to in size.

==Law and government==
Salina is governed by a Mayor and five-person City Council. It is operated under the &quot;Salina City Code&quot;, last updated in 2002.

The city operates the following departments: City Police; Planning and Zoning; Justice Court; Maintenance; Library; Recreation Program; Swimming Pool; Fire Department; and the Blackhawk Arena.

==Education==
The city has one elementary school, one middle school, and one high school and is located in the Sevier School District. The nearest college is a branch of Snow College located in Richfield, 20 miles (32 km) south of Salina.

==Culture and recreation==
The Salina municipal library is located at 90 W. Main Street.

Salina is at the northern edge of an extensive ATV trail which covers the southern portion of Utah, the &quot;Paiute Trail&quot;.

==Transportation==
The nearest airport is the Salina-Gunnison Airport, north. Its longest paved runway length is 3,815 ft (1,163 m). The Richfield Airport, south of Salina, has a paved runway of 6,645 ft (2,025 m).

Interstate 70, U.S.Route 50 and U.S.Route 89 intersect in the city, providing surface access to outside areas. The western end of Utah State Route 24 is in Salina.

<text>Coalville is a city in and the county seat of Summit County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,486 as of the 2020 census. Interstate 80 passes through the town, as well as the Weber River, which flows into Echo Reservoir, just north of Coalville.

==History==

Coalville originally began as a settlement known as Chalk Creek. In 1853, Mormon Church president Brigham Young awarded hundreds of acres of farmland to trailblazer and trusted bodyguard &quot;Return&quot; Jackson Redden. Redden first visited the valley around 1846 while scouting trail ahead of advance Mormon pioneers. The first recorded settlement was Redden&#x27;s ranch, spanning from 100 N. Main Street to beyond the Coalville City Cemetery where he is buried. In 1854, the territorial government in Utah offered a $1000 reward to anyone who could find coal within 40 miles of Salt Lake City. Four years later, Redden and associate Thomas Rhodes found a coal vein in the Chalk Creek area, and coal mining began in earnest. Hundreds of tons of coal were shipped to Salt Lake City, and soon a narrow gauge railroad was built. The settlement was then renamed Coalville, as a result of this early success.

Coalville was officially founded in 1859 by William Henderson Smith, an early Mormon freighter. He noticed that wheat, spilled by other wagons moving through the area, would grow to maturity without being tended. He subsequently convinced four families to settle in the area with him.
Early life in Coalville was difficult, and during winters, the settlers dealt with a constant scarcity of food. When food ran out, they would travel to Salt Lake City for supplies. The local Indian tribes were also hostile for a time, and the settlers built a fort on the advice of Brigham Young. In 1867, Coalville was incorporated.

By 1880, success in the coal industry led to the extension of the railroad into Park City. Then known as the Summit County Railway, the railroad continued to transport coal and was also used for Park City&#x27;s silver mines.

Unlike most Mormon settlements in Utah and the intermountain west, Coalville city streets are not aligned to the true north. Main Street in Coalville is offset such that it runs slightly north-northwest, and Center street runs slightly east-northeast. 
Both the Thomas L. Allen House and the Summit Stake Tabernacle in Coalville are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (12.27%) is water.

Coalville has a high-altitude, warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) that borders a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), characterized by extreme diurnal temperature ranges that range from extremely cold winter nights to hot afternoons in the summer. However, the high altitude and low humidity mean that mornings in the summer remain very cool, and frosts have occasionally occurred—even in July. Precipitation is moderate throughout the year, though with a minimum in summer, and snow accumulation is generally heavy due to the very cold nights between November and March, with a median of for the year.

Coalville is located at the intersection of two narrow valleys—formed by Chalk Creek and the Weber River. Like other valley locations in northern Utah, Coalville experiences pronounced temperature inversions associated with high-pressure systems during winter months, with low temperatures below 0 °F relatively common. Owing to this localized phenomenon, observed low temperatures are often significantly lower than those forecasted by national agencies.
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,382 people, 465 households, and 371 families residing in the city. The population density was 483.9 people per square mile (/km2). There were 495 housing units at an average density of 173.3 per square mile (/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 93.13% White, 0.07% African American, 0.80% Native American, 0.29% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 4.92% from other races, and 0.72% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.87% of the population.

There were 465 households, out of which 47.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.6% were married couples living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.2% were non-families. 18.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.97, and the average family size was 3.41.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 33.8% under 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 15.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.7 males. For every 100 females aged 18 and over, there were 103.3 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $39,342, and the median income for a family was $43,929. Males had a median income of $32,727 versus $20,833 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,830. About 5.9% of families and 8.0% of the population were below the poverty line, (over 40% of students receive reduced or free lunch) including 11.9% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those aged 65 or over.

==Education==
It is in the North Summit School District. The district consists of North Summit High School, Middle School, and Elementary School. North Summit High School&#x27;s mascot is the Brave, and the school colors are purple and gold. The school mascot was chosen because of the Western Shoshone tribes that once lived in the area.

==Economy==
Some residents of the Coalville area pursue careers in farming, ranching, construction, public education, and county government—though many commute to the Wasatch Front. Ranchers in the area primarily raise beef and dairy cows, sheep, and mink. Crops such as alfalfa and wheat are also cultivated.

There is a small grocery store, a few restaurants, two motels, and several small gas/convenience stores. A health clinic serves residents of Coalville and other settlements in northern Summit County, as well as a dental office. Vacant commercial real estate continues to be a problem, especially along the main street, as is the case in many small towns in rural America—an effect of urbanization.

<text>Kamas ( ) is a city in southwestern Summit County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,811 at the 2010 census. It is east of downtown Salt Lake City. Its main industries are cattle ranching and lumber. The town is known as &quot;The Gateway to the Uinta Mountains&quot;.

==History==

Kamas derives its name from &quot;Camassia quamash&quot;, a flowering grass that grows in the region and was a source of food for Native Americans.

Kamas was inhabited intermittently by several Native American ethnic groups, including members of the Ute, Shoshone, and Snake tribes. The first permanent settlements in the valley are believed to have been built by Mormon pioneers, including Abraham Marchant, John Lambert, and John Pack, who settled under the direction of Brigham Young.

One prominent figure in Kamas folklore history is Thomas Rhoads. According to legend, guides from a local Ute Tribe revealed to Rhoads the location of a gold mine from which he was allowed to take gold to assist in the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. The only condition the Ute guides gave for revealing the mine&#x27;s location was that Rhoads not reveal it to anyone else. He adhered to the terms of this agreement until his death. The &quot;Rhoads Mine&quot; is now considered lost, but its legend survives in several books on the topic.

== History ==

The valley was inhabited by Ute Indians before the coming of Mormon pioneers. A historical monument erected in 1939 across the street from the current town hall by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, honors the habitation of the Utes. &quot;INDIAN TRAIL This valley, settled by Thomas Rhoades in 1858, was a summer paradise for Indians who came to hunt, fish and gather wild fruit and sego bulbs. The Weber River Indian Trail skirted the east foothills to Oakley Canyon, crossed the river at the Old Kamas Ford, 3 1/2 miles east of here, running thence to Henry&#x27;s Fork, and to Brush Creek, in the eastern Uinta Mountains. This trail was used by Indians, Scouts and Pioneers, and is marked in part by roads today.&quot;

A Mormon pioneer, Parley P. Pratt, was sent to this valley from Salt Lake City by Brigham Young in 1850 to check on the possibility of establishing settlements along the Weber River and the nearby Provo River. His report was, &quot;. . . a good valley, abundant grass and plenty of water&quot;.

The first white man to winter there, in 1853, was Thomas Rhodes. An explorer, trapper, prospector, part-time farmer, and close friend of Brigham Young, he was occasionally called from his California prospecting by Brigham Young when there was a need for money for the church. Rhodes would disappear for a week or so into the Uinta Mountains and return with a supply of gold.

The first settlers in Oakley were William Stevens and wife, Emma Crowden Stevens; they moved there in 1868. Soon to follow were relatives and friends, among them the Fraziers, Johnsons, Hortins, Richards, Wildes and Gibbons, to name a few; all these names are still prominent in the town.

Oakley&#x27;s original name was &quot;Oak Creek&quot;, derived from the name of a creek that ran just east of the present town site and that was thickly overgrown with oak trees. The town changed its name to &quot;Oakley&quot; in late 1886 or early 1887; the new name was chosen from many names submitted by the settlers in a contest.

The current town hall was built as a LDS church in 1903, followed by a schoolhouse in 1904.

Incorporated in 1933 on land originally purchased from the Union Pacific Company by the early settlers in the land sale of the 1880s, Oakley has maintained its small town charm as primarily an agricultural community. At one time, it was a large producer of dairy products. More recently, it has focused on cattle- and horse-feeding, &quot;haying&quot;, and still some dairy production. In addition, it is a base for recreational activities, which abound—hiking, fishing, horseback riding, camping, hunting, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing—all within a very short distance from town.

Memories of early residents can give a real feeling for the town in its early days of the 20th century. Charles Reed Seymour, son of LDS Bishop John Heber Seymour, wrote the following:

Lifelong resident Ken Woolstenhulme bought the small local grocery store then named The Merc in 1971 and ran it as Ken&#x27;s Kash until selling it to Larry Devey in 2008. Then and now, the store is a gathering place for locals looking for the last ingredient for dinner. Those who grew up locally remember it fondly as one of the last places to offer penny candy. For a time, the store served as the local post office, but increased demand from summer homes up Weber Canyon led the federal government in 1985 to build the present post-office building across the street from the store.

Ken Woolstenhulme has been involved in all aspects of the town&#x27;s life, including serving as postmaster, county commissioner, school board member and town mayor at various times in his life.

In 1998, Mayor Doug Evans and the town of Oakley discovered an underground aquifer containing water that had not seen the surface in at least 18,000 years, according to carbon testing. Found nearly 1900 feet below the surface in a layer of Mississippian limestone, the water proved among the purest ever tested, free of tritium and any other contamination from the nuclear age. Requiring little treatment, the water is free of pesticides and herbicides and the town now uses this water from the Humbug Well for its municipal water supply. Local businessmen have also bought the rights to bottle the water and sell it under different labels.

== Local attractions ==
Oakley is most famous for its annual rodeo, held each year on the Fourth of July weekend. This rodeo, sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2005 with the opening of a $3 million, 6,000-seat arena. A large town park surrounds the rodeo grounds, hosting softball, baseball and soccer tournaments throughout the summer, with Ute League football in the fall and recreational soccer in the spring. Oakley has two eating establishments, the locally owned Polar King and the Road Island Diner, a former train car made into a restaurant that is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
It is in the South Summit School District.

Oakley School, a boarding school for high school students, was formerly located in Oakley. It closed in 2017.

<text>Grantsville is the second most populous city in Tooele County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 12,617 at the 2020 census. The city has grown slowly and steadily throughout most of its existence, but rapid increases in growth occurred during the 1970s, 1990s, and 2010s. Recent rapid growth has been attributed to being close to Salt Lake City, small town community feel, lower housing costs than Salt Lake County, the nearby Deseret Peak recreational center, the Utah Motorsports Campus raceway, and the newly built Wal-Mart distribution center located just outside the city. It is quickly becoming a bedroom community for commuters into the Salt Lake Valley.

==History==
The area of Grantsville was originally populated by the Goshute tribe.

Grantsville was originally called &quot;Willow Creek&quot;, and has also been called &quot;Twenty Wells&quot; due to the natural wells that give fresh water to the area. Grantsville was settled by Mormon pioneers in 1850, with the arrival of the brothers-in-law James McBride and Harrison Severe, with their wives and families. The present name, after Col. George D. Grant, a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was adopted c. 1853. A post office called Grantsville has been in operation since 1864. The Anderson–Clark Farmstead has outbuildings dating back from 1880, and was first owned by the pioneer James McBride.

==Geography==
Grantsville is bordered on the south by South Mountain, which separates Rush Valley from Tooele Valley. To the north is Stansbury Island, and on the east are the Oquirrh Mountains and the Great Salt Lake, and on the west side the Stansbury Mountains. SR-138 passes through the city, heading northwest to intersect with I-80 and east to Stansbury Park.

== Events ==

The Old Folks Sociable is the traditional social event of the year. The Old Folks Sociable idea started in 1875 when professional photographer Charles Savage and LDS Church Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter inaugurated &quot;Old Folks Day&quot; to honor fathers and mothers.

The Old Folks Sociable honors all residents and former residents who are 75 years older. Grantsville High School, home to the Old Folks Sociable, becomes a gathering place for high school class reunions and family reunions. The Sociable is also a celebration of Grantsville&#x27;s heritage. For residents and former residents, it is a walk down memory lane.

<doc id="137129" wikidata="Q2461509" url="?curid=137129" title="Stansbury Park, Utah">
<text>Stansbury Park is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tooele County, Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 9,851, up from the 2010 figure of 5,145.

Stansbury Park is located in the northern end of Tooele Valley at the base of the Oquirrh Mountains. Traveling by Interstate 80, Stansbury Park is 35 minutes from downtown Salt Lake City.

Stansbury Park was proposed by the original developer (Terracor) as a planned community with a lake for sailing and canoeing, an eighteen-hole golf course, clubhouse, swimming pool, and parks. Although the original developer withdrew from the scene in the 1980s due to bankruptcy, that plan has generally been followed. The parks throughout Stansbury Park include baseball diamonds, soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, play areas for children, skateboard park, and an astronomical observatory. A large park northwest of Utah State Route 138 is being developed. A natural lake (The Mill Pond) exists on the northern edge of the area; it is fed by a spring at its southeast end. The outflow water from this lake is piped around the Oquirrh Mountain Range (east of Stansbury Park) to the Kennecott Company&#x27;s copper mine refinery operation (the runoff water from the lake enters a large pipe NW of the Benson Grist Mill for transport to the Kennecott operation).

The area includes several businesses, clustered in two developments at the southeast and northeast corners of the area along Utah State Route 36.

As of 2019, the community is not incorporated; thus all municipal services (except for water and sewer service) are provided by Tooele County. A proposal to incorporate was voted down in November 2016.

==Recreation==
The 18-hole public golf course runs through the center of Stansbury Park. It contains 14 lakes. All the par 3 holes are over water and 16 of the holes have water hazards. During the winter, Stansbury Park is often the only course open in the greater Salt Lake City area. The course has a clubhouse with food service, a pro shop, putting green and driving range.

The Harmon&#x27;s astronomical observatory, the Stansbury Park Observing Complex, is at the north end near the skateboard park. The observatory boasts a 40 cm (16&quot;) Ealing reflector, an 81 cm (32&quot;) reflector and a 200 mm (8&quot;) refractor along with computerized tracking and CCD imaging capabilities. The facility is owned and operated by the Salt Lake Astronomical Society. In 2017 another building was erected north of the original complex buildings, to house the world&#x27;s largest amateur-built reflector telescope.

==Schools==
Stansbury Park has four public-education schools and one charter school. There are three public elementary schools (K through 6th grades) and one high school. Stansbury Elementary opened in 1979, Rose Springs Elementary opened in 2005, and Old Mill opened in 2017. Stansbury High School (9th through 12th), just southwest of Rose Springs Elementary School, opened in August 2009. Bonneville Academy, on the west edge of Stansbury Park, is a K-8 Charter school with a focus on STEM education.

== Churches ==
As of 2009, there were five church buildings in Stansbury Park, all units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). An LDS meetinghouse northwest of the Benson Grist Mill was placed into service in early 2009; that area was not part of the original Stansbury Park proposal, but since its water and sewer are provided by the Stansbury Park Improvement District, it is now considered an integral part of the development.

==Miscellaneous==

Stansbury Park receives mail service from the Tooele Post Office, ZIP 84074.

Drinking water for Stansbury Park comes from deep wells about two miles southeast of the park, east of Utah State Route 36. Originally, the golf course was watered from another deep well within the Park boundary at the southeast corner, but that water had such a high level of hardness that it was abandoned in 1985 and the potable-water well is now also used to serve the golf course. Sewer service is provided by a lagoon complex northwest of the community (north of Utah State Route 138). These services are administered by the Stansbury Park Improvement District.

The golf course, swimming pool, and common areas within Stansbury Park were originally administered by two separate service districts (Stansbury Greenbelt Service Area #1 and SGSA #2), but since August 1992 have been administered by a combined district, the Stansbury Service Agency, whose volunteer, unpaid board members are elected by the population.

Woodland Park, near the southeast end of Stansbury Park, contains trees which existed before the development started. The park area was the site of a large horse stable complex before and during the first part of the area&#x27;s present development. It presently contains a children&#x27;s playground and a basketball court.

Benson Grist Mill, north of the original area of Stansbury Park, is a restoration of an actual nineteenth-century water-powered (powered by waterflow from The Mill Pond) wheat-grinding mill built on that site, and has grown into a recreational and historical interest area.

Stansbury Lake, southwest of The Mill Pond, is a manmade lake. A peninsula which extends into the lake, called &quot;Captain&#x27;s Island&quot;, contains 178 houses, and there are another 143 houses along the lake&#x27;s shores. The lake is noted for its boating (non-motor-powered boats only, although electric motors are now allowed), swimming, and fishing. Resident fish include bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, grass carp, and yellow perch. Black crappie were planted at one time but have apparently not continued. Carp have been introduced at times in attempts to control weed growth in the lake.

The original addressing scheme for Stansbury Park was to divide the area into &quot;neighborhoods&quot;, each with a name and with the houses therein to be numbered from 1 to XXX. The three original neighborhoods were &quot;Country Club&quot;, &quot;Lake View&quot;, and &quot;Mill Pond&quot; (which consisted of blocks of condominiums rather than individual houses). This addressing system is confusing to resident and outsider alike, and areas developed since 1990 have abandoned that concept, instead using individual street names and house numbers which integrate into the Tooele City numbering system (although the starting point of Tooele City&#x27;s numbering system is some seven miles distant).

Stansbury Park has an active community association, originally named the &quot;Stansbury Park Homeowners Association&quot;, but now named the &quot;Stansbury Park Community Association&quot;. This organization grants preliminary approval to housing and remodeling plans within the service area (Tooele County Engineering Department grants final approval), and organizes outdoor activities such as &quot;Stansbury Days&quot; every third Saturday in August, Easter Egg hunts, gardening classes and other local celebrations such as fireworks displays on holidays. In its early days it published an annual telephone/address directory covering the area.

<text>Stockton is a town in Tooele County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 616 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Stockton was born of the first mining boom in the Utah Territory. The mining industry began in the early 1860s with the arrival of Col. Patrick E. Connor, commander of the Third California Volunteers, who had been sent to the territory in 1862 to keep an eye on the overland mail routes during the Civil War. Connor wanted to counterbalance his perceived dominance of Mormon leaders in the area by exploring and developing the territory&#x27;s mineral wealth. He posited that if precious metals could be discovered in Utah, the resulting flood of miners into the territory would overwhelm the Mormons, and outsiders would balance the Church&#x27;s power. So he sent the men under his command out to prospect, and they almost singlehandedly opened the precious metals industry in Utah in 1863 by locating deposits, staking claims, and establishing mining districts. Mines were dug on the western slopes of the Oquirrh Mountains, and Stockton became a base camp for some these operations.

The small town was first settled in 1863. Under the growing influence of the mining industry, the population swelled to 4,000 residents. It was the first town in the Utah Territories to have its streets surveyed and named, and it later gained the distinction of being the first to get electric lights, and the first to get a telephone. A town cemetery (northwest of the settlement) was created shortly into the twentieth century. Other amenities were slowly addressed, and they now include a ball diamond, a city park, a city hall, a fire station, a municipal water system, and a centralized wastewater collection/disposal system.

A sesquicentennial commemoration was held on April 27, 2013, to mark the town&#x27;s founding. Part of the ceremony was the unveiling of a welcome sign, mounted on the north end town and visible from the main highway through the town&#x27;s business district, SR-36.

==Government==
The town is led by a mayor and a town council. At the end of 2012, the following departments or personnel are also in existence:
* Town clerk (part-time employee)
* Town treasurer (part-time employee)
* Third District Court Judge and Clerk (part-time employees)
* Town attorney (on retainer)
* Planning and zoning committee (5 volunteer members)
* Police department (one full-time employee and 8 reserve volunteers)
* Fire department (all volunteers)
* Public works (one full-time employee)
** Streets
** Parks
** Cemetery
** Garbage

Stockton made headlines in 2009 after Mayor Dan Rydalch fired one of the town&#x27;s five police officers for issuing his son a traffic citation.

<text>Tooele ( ) is a city in Tooele County in the U.S. state of Utah. The population was 35,742 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Tooele County. Located approximately 40 minutes southwest of Salt Lake City, Tooele is known for Tooele Army Depot, for its views of the nearby Oquirrh Mountains and the Great Salt Lake.

The city of Tooele is home to one of the nine regional statewide campuses of Utah State University as well as the Deseret Peak Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==History==
The Tooele Valley was the traditional territory of the Tooele Valley Goshute, a band of the Goshute Shoshone. The ancient presence of humans in the area is attested by extensive archaeological work at the Danger Cave site, which confirms people were present and active by 9000 BP [7000 BC].

When Mormon pioneers entered the Great Salt Lake Valley in July 1847, it was covered with abundant tall grass. The Mormons first used the valley as wintering grounds for their herds. In September 1849, three families settled on a small stream south of present-day Tooele City. Other families slowly joined them, and by 1853 Tooele City Corporation was organized.

During the nineteenth century, the town was primarily an agricultural community; by the century&#x27;s end its population was about 1,200.

The 20th century brought more industrialization; in 1904 the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad built a line through the city, and in 1909 the International Smelting and Refining Company smelter was built in Carr Fork/Pine Canyon east of the city . The Tooele Valley Railway, a seven-mile line, ran from the smelter west to the Union Pacific Railroad main line. This line brought ore from various area mines to the smelter; later a 20,000 ft aerial tramway was also used to transport ore from the mine to the smelter. By 1941 a 22,000 ft tunnel had been completed through the mountain, to move ore to the smelter entirely underground. The smelter began processing copper in 1910, with lead and zinc processing commencing in 1912. In 1946 the copper smelter ceased operation, the zinc operation halted in 1968, and the lead processing was halted in 1972. The entire site was demolished during 1972–74. However, consideration was being given during this latter period to extracting ore from Carr Fork Canyon, rather than relying on the ore from the east face of the mountain range. In 1969 the mining company began exploration drilling. In 1974 a copper mine and mill (&quot;Carr Fork Operations&quot;) was started; it began processing ore in 1979, and ran until 1981. The Tooele Valley Railway was used to haul away the scrap when the International smelter was torn down, and remained to serve the Pine Canyon mill. It was shut down and abandoned when the Pine Canyon “Carr Fork” mine and mill shut down; its last day of operation was August 28, 1982.

In the eastern section of Tooele, “New Town” was built for many of the 1,000 smelter workers. Families from the Balkans, Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor lived in this area and formed their own community. New Town included its own school, church, culture and numerous languages.

When World War II started, the federal government obtained 25,000 acres in the southwestern part of the Tooele Valley to establish an ordnance depot (&quot;Tooele Ordnance Depot&quot;).

In 1993 the scope and mission of the Tooele Army Depot (as the previous Ordnance Depot was now called) was reduced, and about 1,700 acres of its area including many buildings were annexed to Tooele City. The US Army conveyed 40 acres of land, including a newly constructed large-vehicle maintenance structure (&quot;Consolidated Maintenance Facility&quot;) to the City, who converted it into an industrial complex (&quot;Utah Industrial Depot&quot;, UID). In 2013 the UID was purchased by another company and is presently known as &quot;Ninigret Depot.&quot;
In 2011, the Junior Jazz, a part of JR. NBA, which is basketball from the NBA for minors, was removed from Tooele, as well as Stansbury Park. The Tooele County School District cancelled the contract with the Utah Sports Academy, causing the end of Tooele County Junior Jazz. However, though, the Jr. Buffs Basketball team, which is basically Tooele High School Buffaloes Sports for minors, was kept.

On November 3, 2023, a semi-truck driver named Moab James Stapley lost control and crashed into a light pole at a car dealership, causing one seriously injured and 10 others injured. Stapley was charged with numerous infractions, including reckless driving and operating a vehicle with inadequate brakes.

==Arts festival==
The Tooele Arts Festival, an annual three-day event, hosts vendors of one-of-a-kind artwork, including paintings, jewelry, ceramics, photographs, and sculptures. The event includes live musical entertainment, children&#x27;s playground equipment and entertainment. There is no admission fee for the festival, which is held at a city-owned park west of the city center. It began in 1985; for the first several years of its existence the Festival was held near the end of May, but it seemed to coincide with late-spring cold spells, which were disastrous given the Festival&#x27;s open-air setting. Due to this unpredictability, sponsors decided in 1998 to move it to the final weekend of June, although this puts it in direct competition with the much larger Utah Arts Festival, held in Salt Lake City on the same dates. The 2011 Tooele Arts Festival was cancelled due to lack of volunteers; this was the first time since 1985 that no arts festival was held in Tooele City. The Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in June 2016.

==County fair==
Until 2000, the annual Tooele County Fair was held during the first week of August at the Tooele County Fairgrounds, inside Tooele City. Since that date, it has been held at the Deseret Peak Complex, located in the Tooele Valley midway between Tooele City and Grantsville City.

<text>Wendover is a city on the western edge of Tooele County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,115 at the 2020 census.

==Description==
Wendover is on the western border of Utah and is contiguous with West Wendover, Nevada. Interstate 80 runs just north of both cities, while Interstate 80 Business (Wendover Boulevard) runs through the two cities. The Wendover Cut-off was the former path of the Victory Highway as well as U.S. Route 40 to Wendover. Today it serves as a frontage road between Wendover and Knolls just to the south of the Interstate.

==History==
The town was established in 1908 as a station stop on the Western Pacific Railroad, then under construction. The town&#x27;s name comes from either railroad surveyor Charles Wendover or from &quot;wending over&quot; the desert.

The transcontinental telephone line was completed as workers raised the final pole at Wendover, Utah on June 27, 1914, after construction of of telephone line. However, the line was not utilized until January 25, 1915, when the first transcontinental telephone call was made to coincide with the opening of the Panama Pacific Exposition.

From 1917 to 1939, a Western Pacific subsidiary known as the Deep Creek Railroad also operated into Wendover. The Western Pacific became part of the larger Union Pacific Railroad in 1983.
During World War II, the nearby Wendover Army Air Field (later known as the Wendover Air Force Base) was a training base for bomber pilots, including the crew of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;. The Enola Gay was stationed here until June 1945.

In 2008, the Utah Department of Transportation completed an interchange at Aria Boulevard on Interstate 80. Investment is also underway to restore the Wendover Airport (located at the former Wendover Air Force Base) which is currently managed by Tooele County.

Movements to unite Wendover with West Wendover, which is located across the border in Nevada and allows gambling operations, have taken place, but require the approval of both the U.S. Congress and the Nevada and Utah legislatures. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution permitting Wendover to leave Utah and join Nevada in 2002, but the bill was stalled in the U.S. Senate and did not become law.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,537 people, 432 households, and 327 families residing in the city. The population density was 238.9 people per square mile (92.3/km2).

Of all households, 16.7% were made up of individuals, and 3.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.56 and the average family size was 4.10.

===Climate===
Wendover and West Wendover have a cool arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) with hot summers, freezing winters, and substantial diurnal temperature ranges. The cities&#x27; location east of the Ruby Mountains makes them the driest in the Great Basin, averaging only of precipitation per year, or about half that of nearby Ely or Elko. It affects snowfall even more dramatically: Wendover and West Wendover average only of snow, one-eighth to one-tenth the snowfall of the two nearby county seats.
==Education==
Tooele County School District&#x27;s Anna Smith Elementary School serves the Wendover area.

Circa 1996, when there were talks about moving Wendover into Nevada, some area people were concerned that this would encourage the school district to stop spending funds on proposals for schools in Wendover. At the time Wendover did not have an elementary school and residents wished to have one.

As a result, Fort Duchesne has a cold-semi arid near cold desert climate instead of a subarctic climate despite the frigid winters. Precipitation, although very minimal, can be seen throughout the year with the late summer and early fall months seeing more than any other month of the year. However, there isn&#x27;t a month that averages more than 1 inch.

<text>Vernal, the county seat and largest city in Uintah County, is in northeastern Utah, approximately east of Salt Lake City and west of the Colorado border. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 10,079. The population has since grown to 10,432 as of the 2022 population estimate.

Vernal is home to the Vernal Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and one of the nine statewide regional campuses of Utah State University. The city serves as a gateway to the nearby Dinosaur National Monument, Flaming Gorge, and the Uinta Mountain Range.

==History==
Vernal, unlike most Utah towns, was not settled by Mormons moving west, or across the state. Brigham Young sent a scouting party to the area Uintah Basin in 1861 and received word back that the area was good for nothing but nomad purposes, hunting grounds for Indians, and &quot;to hold the world together.&quot; That same year, President Abraham Lincoln set the area aside as the Uintah Indian Reservation, with Captain Pardon Dodds appointed as Indian agent. Dodds later built the first cabin erected by a white man in the Uintah Basin around 1868. Settlers began to filter in after that and built cabins in various spots on or near Ashley Creek. In 1879, many came close to perishing during the infamous &quot;Hard Winter&quot; of that same year.

==Geography==
Vernal is in the Uintah Basin, bordered on the north by the Uinta Mountains, one of the relatively few mountain ranges which lie in an east–west rather than the usual north-to-south direction. The Tavaputs Plateau lies to the south and Blue Mountain to the east, while Vernal itself lies in Ashley Valley. The valley is named in honor of William H. Ashley, an early fur trader who entered the area in 1825 by floating down the Green River in a bull boat made of animal hides.

Vernal is located on the northern edge of the Colorado Plateau and south of Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area on the Utah-Wyoming state line. The city is in a high desert area of the Colorado Plateau.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.6 square miles (11.9 km2), all land.

==Notable buildings==

The Bank of Vernal (a.k.a. the &#x27;Parcel Post&#x27; Bank) Building (3 West Main Street) is a registered historical building in the Uintah County Landmark Register. Also known as &quot;the Bank that was sent by Mail&quot;, the Bank of Vernal was constructed in 1916–1917 by William H. Coltharp, a Vernal businessman and entrepreneur. Coltharp took advantage of inexpensive Parcel Post rates to ship some 80,000 masonry bricks in fifty-pound (22.6 kg) packages via the U.S. Post Office the from Salt Lake City to Vernal. The Parcel Post brick shipments were transported from Salt Lake to Mack, Colorado by Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad, then proceeded to Watson via the narrow gauge Uintah Railway, finally Vernal by wagon freight through steep roads. The full trip was over 420 miles (675.9 km) long. After completing delivery of the bricks, the U.S. Post Office hastily changed its regulations, establishing a limit of per day per sender. The United States Postmaster General Albert Sidney Burleson explicitly stated in a letter that &quot;it is not the intent of the United States Postal Service that buildings be shipped through the mail&quot; Today the building is used as a branch office of Zions Bank.

The Quarry Visitor Center in Dinosaur National Monument, and the Vernal Utah Temple are other historic Vernal buildings. The Vernal Temple is a small LDS temple in the old Vernal Tabernacle. It was built as the result of a local movement to save the old tabernacle when it was scheduled for demolition.

==History==

1828 Four French traders from Kentucky -- William &quot;Toopeechee&quot; Reed, Jim Reed, Dennis Julien, and Augustus Archambeaux -- entered the Uintah Basin and set up a trading post near a spring of water just south and east of the present settlement of Whiterocks. The site was at a junction of trails used by the local Ute people. They brought in the first butcher knives, coffee beans, and other articles traded to the locals for fur. Antoine Robidoux (or Rubidoux) purchased the enterprise in 1832 and built a larger &quot;fort&quot; just east of the post named Fort Robidoux (or Fort Uinta). In 1844, Utes burned the trading post to the ground and it was not rebuilt. 

October 3, 1861 By order of Abraham Lincoln and the secretary of the Interior the &quot;Uintah Valley in the Territory of Utah, be set apart and reserved for the use and occupancy of Indian Tribes.&quot;

1868 Amos Reed, a government clerk in the employment of the Indian Service, made a trip to Whiterocks. His guide, Chief Antero, said that since he was to be moved to the Uintah Reservation he would choose Whiterocks for his home, and he suggested to Mr. Reed that the Indian Agency be established at that place. His reason for his choice was the fact that Whiterocks was located in the center of the Basin. Here the local Utes were used to staying. Here traders and trappers had established posts and headquarters. Many trails led to and from it, and here the site had a lovely natural setting. On the recommendation of Chief Antero, the agency was moved from Rock Creek to Whiterocks on Christmas Day 1868.

==Archaeology==
Whiterocks is near the site of the eponymous &quot;Whiterocks Village,&quot; a Uinta Fremont village partially excavated in 1966 by Wayne F. Shields, assigned on the basis of architecture and radiocarbon dates to the Whiterocks Phase, A.D. 800-950. The excavated portion consisted of four round pithouses, 12-18 square feet in size, and a rectangular granary 25 by 29.5 feet in dimensions featuring coursed adobe walls. Of the four dwellings, two had masonry walls and central firepits, while the other two had single stone walls and no firepits. One fragmentary burial with two disarticulated skeletons was reportedly found but not described in the published report.

The site is notable for a high frequency of Uinta Gray pottery sherds; 5,675 potsherds were recovered, 5,540 of which were interpreted as Uinta Gray, a diagnostic style of the Uinta Fremont characterized by calcite temper. 
Other artifacts included chipped and ground stone tools, shells, nine corncobs, beans, and bone tools.

The site is on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the surface of the site was under cultivation at the time of excavation and was presumed to have been largely destroyed by agricultural activity.

<text>Alpine is a city on the northeastern edge of Utah County, Utah, United States. The population was 10,251 at the time of the 2020 census. Alpine has been one of the many quickly-growing cities of Utah since the 1970s, especially in the 1990s. This city is thirty-two miles southeast of Salt Lake City. It is located on the slopes of the Wasatch Range north of Highland and American Fork. The west side of the city runs above the Wasatch Fault.

==History==

The area, which would one day become Alpine, was settled by William Wordsworth and several other homesteading families in the fall of 1850. The town was originally called Mountainville, and under the latter name settlement was first made in 1851. The city was renamed because the views from the elevated town site were compared to the Swiss Alps. In the 1860s Mrs. Joseph Walton made a flag to represent the city. The flag was carried across the county, it flew for 40 years.

==Geography==
Alpine is located on State Route 74, just north of the city of Highland.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . None of that area is covered with water, although several small mountain streams run through the city for years with sufficient rainfall.

There are several mountain biking trails around the city that attract bikers from all over the state. There are also many trails and paths well suited for back-trail hiking along the mountains. The nearby American Fork Canyon offers camping, swimming, and access to mountaineering regions around Mount Timpanogos.

The hills surrounding Alpine have been affected by several brush fires in recent years, the most devastating of which was the Quail Fire, which consumed over 2200 acres on the north-east side of town in July 2012. The area is serviced by the Lone Peak Fire Department and Lone Peak Police Force.

<text>American Fork is a city in north-central Utah County, Utah, United States, at the foot of Mount Timpanogos in the Wasatch Range, north from Utah Lake. This city is thirty-two miles southeast of Salt Lake City. It is part of the Provo–Orem Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 33,337 in 2020. The city has grown rapidly since the 1970s.

==History==
The area around Utah Lake was used as a seasonal hunting and fishing ground by the Ute Indians. American Fork was settled in 1850 by Mormon pioneers and incorporated as Lake City in 1852. The first settlers were Arza Adams, followed by Stephen Chipman (grandfather of Stephen L. Chipman, a prominent citizen around the start of the 20th Century), Ira Eldredge, John Eldredge and their families.

The first settlers of American Fork lived in scattered conditions along the American Fork River. By the 1850s, the tension between the settlers and Native Americans was increasing. In 1853, Daniel H. Wells, the head of the Nauvoo Legion (the Utah Territorial Militia at the time), instructed settlers to move into specific forts. At a meeting on July 23, 1853, at the schoolhouse in American Fork, Lorenzo Snow and Parley P. Pratt convinced the settlers to follow Wells&#x27; directions and all move together into a central fort. A fort was built of to which the settlers located. Only parts of the wall were built to eight feet high, and none were built to the original plan of twelve feet high.

Settlers changed the name from Lake City to American Fork in 1860. It was renamed after the American Fork river, which runs through the city, to avoid confusion with Salt Lake City, about 30 miles to the north. Most residents were farmers and merchants during American Fork&#x27;s early history. By the 1860s, American Fork had established a public school, making it the first community in the territory of Utah to offer public education to its citizens. In the 1870s, American Fork served as a rail access point for mining activities in American Fork Canyon. American Fork had &quot;a literal social feud&quot; with the town of Lehi due to the Utah Sugar Company choosing Lehi as the factory building site in 1890 instead of American Fork. There were several mercantile businesses in American Fork, such as the American Fork Co-operative Association and Chipman Mercantile. For several decades in the 1900s, raising chickens (and eggs) was an important industry in the city. In 1892, Joseph Forbes organized the schools in American Fork, and the Forbes school is named after him.

During World War II, the town population expanded when the Columbia Steel plant was built. An annual summer celebration in the city is still called &quot;Steel Days&quot; in honor of the economic importance of the mill, which closed in November 2001. The steel mill was located approximately six miles (10 km) southeast of town, on land on the east shore of Utah Lake.

American Fork built a city hospital in 1937. A new facility was built in 1950 and sold to Intermountain Healthcare in 1977, replacing that hospital with a new facility in 1980.

The 1992 film &quot;The Sandlot&quot; was mostly filmed on the Wasatch Front. The carnival scene was filmed in American Fork on State Street by Robinson Park.

Several scenes from the 1984 movie &quot;Footloose&quot; were also filmed in American Fork, including the opening scene inside the church, the front porch scene with Kevin Bacon and his family, and the gas station scene in which Bacon refuels his Volkswagen.

While the majority of the population are members of the LDS Church, there are several other faith communities in the city. The Community Presbyterian Church of American Fork was organized in 1877.

==Notable people==
* Ben Cahoon, former receiver and coach
* Zackery Farnsworth, current MLS centerback for Real Salt Lake
* Chad Lewis, former NFL tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles

==City ordinances==
As the bedroom community grew and the prospect of businesses locating in Cedar Hills loomed, there was a dispute as to whether stores should be allowed to open on Sunday and whether alcohol should be allowed to be sold. This was due to a large majority of the city&#x27;s residents being members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but it was resolved in 2005 when a referendum vote on two initiatives (one prohibiting businesses from being open on Sunday and the other prohibiting selling alcohol) were defeated. The anchor business for the commercial center, Walmart, opened in 2009 and remains open on Sundays and sells beer.

<doc id="137146" wikidata="Q1589327" url="?curid=137146" title="Memory hierarchy">
<text>In computer architecture, the memory hierarchy separates computer storage into a hierarchy based on response time. Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by their performance and controlling technologies. Memory hierarchy affects performance in computer architectural design, algorithm predictions, and lower level programming constructs involving locality of reference. 

Designing for high performance requires considering the restrictions of the memory hierarchy, i.e. the size and capabilities of each component. Each of the various components can be viewed as part of a hierarchy of memories in which each member is typically smaller and faster than the next highest member of the hierarchy. To limit waiting by higher levels, a lower level will respond by filling a buffer and then signaling for activating the transfer.

There are four major storage levels.
* &quot;Internal&quot; – Processor registers and cache.
* Main – the system RAM and controller cards.
* On-line mass storage – Secondary storage.
* Off-line bulk storage – Tertiary and Off-line storage.
This is a general memory hierarchy structuring. Many other structures are useful. For example, a paging algorithm may be considered as a level for virtual memory when designing a computer architecture, and one can include a level of nearline storage between online and offline storage.

==Properties of the technologies in the memory hierarchy==
* Adding complexity slows down the &quot;memory hierarchy&quot;.
* CMOx memory technology stretches the Flash space in the memory hierarchy
* One of the main ways to increase system performance is minimising how far down the memory hierarchy one has to go to manipulate data.
* Latency and bandwidth are two metrics associated with caches. Neither of them is uniform, but is specific to a particular component of the memory hierarchy.
* Predicting where in the memory hierarchy the data resides is difficult.
* ...the location in the memory hierarchy dictates the time required for the prefetch to occur.

==Examples==
The number of levels in the memory hierarchy and the performance at each level has increased over time. The type of memory or storage components also change historically. For example, the memory hierarchy of an Intel Haswell Mobile processor circa 2013 is:
* Processor registers – the fastest possible access (usually 1 CPU cycle). A few thousand bytes in size
* Cache
** Level 0 (L0) Micro operations cache – 6,144 bytes (6 KiB) in size
** Level 1 (L1) Instruction cache – 128 KiB in size
** Level 1 (L1) Data cache – 128 KiB in size. Best access speed is around 700 GB/s 
** Level 2 (L2) Instruction and data (shared) – 1 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 200 GB/s
** Level 3 (L3) Shared cache – 6 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 100 GB/s
** Level 4 (L4) Shared cache – 128 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 40 GB/s
* Main memory (Primary storage) – GiB in size. Best access speed is around 10 GB/s. In the case of a NUMA machine, access times may not be uniform
* Disk storage (Secondary storage) – Terabytes in size. As of 2017, best access speed is from a consumer solid state drive is about 2000 MB/s
* Nearline storage (Tertiary storage) – Up to exabytes in size. As of 2013, best access speed is about 160 MB/s
* Offline storage

The lower levels of the hierarchy – from disks downwards – are also known as tiered storage. The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:
* Online storage is immediately available for I/O.
* Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.
* Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to bring online.

For example, always-on spinning disks are online, while spinning disks that spin-down, such as massive array of idle disk (MAID), are nearline. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in a tape library, are nearline, while cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline.

Most modern CPUs are so fast that for most program workloads, the is the locality of reference of memory accesses and the efficiency of the caching and memory transfer between different levels of the hierarchy. As a result, the CPU spends much of its time idling, waiting for memory I/O to complete. This is sometimes called the &quot;space cost&quot;, as a larger memory object is more likely to overflow a small/fast level and require use of a larger/slower level. The resulting load on memory use is known as &quot;pressure&quot; (respectively &quot;register pressure&quot;, &quot;cache pressure&quot;, and (main) &quot;memory pressure&quot;). Terms for data being missing from a higher level and needing to be fetched from a lower level are, respectively: register spilling (due to register pressure: register to cache), cache miss (cache to main memory), and (hard) page fault (main memory to disk).

Modern programming languages mainly assume two levels of memory, main memory and disk storage, though in assembly language and inline assemblers in languages such as C, registers can be directly accessed. Taking optimal advantage of the memory hierarchy requires the cooperation of programmers, hardware, and compilers (as well as underlying support from the operating system):
*&quot;Programmers&quot; are responsible for moving data between disk and memory through file I/O.
*&quot;Hardware&quot; is responsible for moving data between memory and caches.
*&quot;Optimizing compilers&quot; are responsible for generating code that, when executed, will cause the hardware to use caches and registers efficiently.

Many programmers assume one level of memory. This works fine until the application hits a performance wall. Then the memory hierarchy will be assessed during code refactoring.

<text>Eagle Mountain is a city in Utah County, Utah. It is part of the Provo–Orem metropolitan area. The city is located to the west as well as north of the Lake Mountains, which are west of Utah Lake. It was incorporated in December 1996 and is rapidly growing. The population was 43,623 at the 2020 census. Eagle Mountain was a town in 2000. It has since been classified as a third-class city in September 2001. In its short history, the city has become known for its rapid growth.

==History==

=== Founding ===
In 1994, John Walden, a real estate developer from Florida, and physicians Scott Gettings and Andrew Zorbis, who all own houses in Park City and come to Utah to ski, bought about 8,000 acres of land in the Cedar Valley at a bankruptcy auction, under the company names of &quot;TI Mortgage&quot; and &quot;Monte Vista Ranch&quot;. No one lived in the area they wanted to incorporate, so they, along with developer Debbie Hooge, who lives in what is now in Eagle Mountain, approached those living in two communities about five miles away, Cedar Pass Ranch, a community of large lots, and Harvest Haven, a polygamous community on the opposite side of Highway 73. 

They signed and the town, at 24 square miles, incorporated in December 1996 as the Town of Eagle Mountain. Debbie Hooge was appointed as the First Mayor of the Town of Eagle Mountain. In 2001, the city was reclassified and renamed to Eagle Mountain City. In 2011, Eagle Mountain extended further west with the annexation of the White Hills neighborhood, which had about 400 residents, as well as an area that is part of the Pole Canyon development plan. The land outside of White Hills was almost 2,900 acres.

=== Landmarks ===
The area is home to several natural and manmade landmarks, including a site along the original Pony Express trail, and a boulder with 1,800-year-old rock art petroglyphs carved by ancient Fremont Indians.

== Geography ==
Eagle Mountain is located at the western and northern bases of the Lake Mountains, in the flat Cedar Valley, east and northeast of the town of Cedar Fort. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

=== Climate ===
Eagle Mountain&#x27;s climate varies drastically between the northeastern Ranches area and the southwestern City Center area. Despite being further south than Salt Lake City, both areas have cooler temperatures, due to sitting at a higher elevation. The Ranches section of the city has slightly milder temperatures, since it is closer to the moderating impact of the Salt Lake and Utah Valleys, as well as the Great Salt Lake, which gives it a climate more similar to Salt Lake City. 

The City Center area near Fairfield lies in the Cedar Valley, which cuts that area off from the moderating influence of the Salt Lake Valley and Great Salt lake. This causes nights to get significantly colder than in the Ranches, and puts it in a rain shadow, causing less precipitation and more sunshine than the Ranches part of the city.

Within the Köppen climate classification, the climate of the Ranches area is classified as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) or hot-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfa&quot;) depending on which variant of the system is used. The City Center area is drier and cooler. The Köppen classification for this area is cold semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;), although rainfall is nearly enough to classify the area as warm-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;).



== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2010, there were 21,415 people, 5,111 households, and 4,741 families residing in the town. The population density was 513.6 inhabitants per square mile (20.0/km2).

== Parks and recreation ==

This park is the first of its kind on the Wasatch Front. It features a jump line, two slopestyle tracks, a single track network, and a skills area with a pump track and wood features.

In January 2015 the city council approved budget for expanding Cory B. Wride Memorial park.

overall, it&#x27;s a boring place there&#x27;s nothing to do.

<text>Elk Ridge is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. It originally incorporated as a town named Salem Hills. It changed its name in 1978 to Elk Ridge, named for the herds of elk that wintered in the area. It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,687 at the time of the 2020 census. 

Elk Ridge became a fifth-class city by state law in November 2000.

==History and geography==
The area that later became Elk Ridge was originally part of Goosenest Ranch at the foot of Mount Loafer at the southern end of Utah County southeast of Salem and Payson. A dirt road was built in 1970 after the ranch was sold, and it was developed into a settlement called Salem Hills. The first home was completed in 1973. The settlement incorporated as a town on December 22, 1976 after gaining over 100 residents, and the town changed its name to Elk Ridge in 1978. The new name was taken from the large herds of elk that roamed the area in and around the town.

The first official government census of the town was in 1980, and the population was 381. It became a fifth-class city in Utah in 2000 when its official population exceeded 1000. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>ACCESS.bus, or A.b for short, is a peripheral-interconnect computer bus developed by Philips and DEC in the early 1990s, based on Philips&#x27; I²C system. It is similar in purpose to USB, in that it allows low-speed devices to be added or removed from a computer on the fly. While it was made available earlier than USB, it never gained the popularity of USB.

==History==
Apple Computer&#x27;s Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), introduced in the mid-1980s, allowed all sorts of low-speed devices like mice and keyboards to be daisy-chained into a single port on the computer, greatly reducing the number of ports needed, as well as the resulting cable clutter. ADB was universal on the Macintosh line by the late 1980s, and offered a clear advantage over the profusion of standards being used on PCs.

A.b was an attempt to reproduce these qualities in a new standard for the PC and workstation market. It had two additional advantages over ADB; hot plugging (plug-n-play) and the ability for the devices to have their own host controllers so devices could be plugged together without the need for a host computer to control the communications. Philips also suggested that the ability to plug any A.b device into any computer meant that people with special devices, like mice designed for people with disabilities, might carry their device from machine to machine.

An industry group, the ACCESS.bus Industry Group, or ABIG, was created in 1993 to control the development of the standard. There were 29 voting members of the group, including Microsoft. By this point DEC had introduced A.b on some of their workstations and a number of peripherals had been introduced by a variety of companies.

Development of USB began the next year, in 1994, and the consortium included a number of the members of the A.b group, notably DEC and Microsoft. Interest in A.b waned, leaving Philips as the primary supporter. A.b had a number of technical advantages over USB, which would not re-appear on that system until years later, and it was also easier and less expensive to implement. However, it was also much slower than USB, ten to a hundred times. USB fit neatly into the performance niche between A.b and FireWire, which made it practical to design a system with USB alone. Intel&#x27;s backing was another deciding factor; the company began including USB controllers in the standard motherboard control chips, making the cost of implementation roughly that of the connector.

The only widespread use of the A.b system was DDC2Ab interface by the VESA group. They needed a standardized bus for communicating device abilities and status between monitors and computers, and selected I²C because it required only two pins; by re-using existing reserved pins in the standard VGA cable they could implement a complete A.b bus (including power). The bus could then be offered as an external expansion port simply by adding a socket on the monitor case. A number of monitors with A.b connectors started appearing in the mid-1990s, notably those by NEC, but this was at about the same time USB was being heavily promoted and few devices were available to plug into them, mostly mice and keyboards. The bus remained the standard way for a monitor to communicate setup information to the host graphics card.

==Technical standard==

A.b is a physical layer definition that describes the physical cabling and connectors used in the network. The higher layers, namely the signaling and protocol issues, are already defined to be the same as Philips&#x27; Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) bus. Compared to I²C, A.b:

* adds two additional pins to provide power to the devices (+5V and GND)
* allows for only 125 devices out of I²C&#x27;s 1024
* supports only the 100 kbit/s &quot;standard mode&quot; and 10 kbit/s &quot;low-speed mode&quot;

The idea was to define a single standard that could be used both inside and outside a computer. A single I²C/A.b controller chip would be used inside the machine, connected on the motherboard to internal devices like the clock and battery power monitor. An A.b connector on the outside would then allow additional devices to be plugged into the bus. This way all of the low- and medium-speed devices on the machine would be driven by a single controller and protocol stack.

A.b also defined a small set of standardized device classes. These included monitors, keyboards, &quot;locators&quot; (pointing devices like mice and joysticks), battery monitors, and &quot;text devices&quot; (modems, etc.). Depending on how much intelligence the device needed, the interface in the device could leave almost all of the work to the driver. This allows A.b to scale down to price points low enough for devices like mice.

Compared to USB, A.b had several advantages. Any device on the bus could be a master or a slave, and a protocol is defined for selecting which one a device should use under any particular circumstance. This allows devices to be plugged together with A.b without a host computer. For instance, a digital camera could be plugged directly into a printer and become the master. Under (standard) USB the computer is always the master and the devices are always slaves.

In order to support the same sort of device-to-device connection, USB requires additional support in dual-role devices to emulate a host and provide similar functionality. This was only standardized years later as part of USB On-The-Go system. Another advantage of A.b is that devices can be strung together into a single daisy-chain—A.b can support, but does not require, the use of hubs. This can reduce cable-clutter significantly.
