<text>Atlas Air, Inc. is a major American cargo airline, passenger charter airline, and aircraft lessor based in White Plains, New York. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings. Atlas Air is the world&#x27;s largest operator of the Boeing 747, with 61 of the type. In 2021, the airline had 4,056 employees and operated to more than 300 global destinations.

== History ==

In 1992, Atlas Air began operations when the airline&#x27;s founder, Michael Chowdry, started leasing aircraft to airlines.

In 1993, China Airlines, the first customer, initiated operations with Atlas Air with one airplane on an aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance (ACMI) agreement. By 1995, Atlas Air began trading publicly. In 1997, Atlas placed an order for 10 new Boeing 747-400F aircraft with another two orders for 747-400Fs placed in 1998.

On January 30, 2004, Atlas Air Worldwide entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In July 2004, the parent company completed its restructuring plan and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

In 2006, Amnesty International released a report on extraordinary rendition, stating that Atlas Air was one of the airlines used by the US government for rendering detainees. This was the basis for the song &quot;Atlas Air&quot; recorded by Massive Attack for the album &quot;Heligoland&quot;. In 2007, Atlas Air began a multiyear training contract with the United States Air Force to provide training for the pilots of Air Force One. The contract also provided training for the Presidential Airlift Group. This program has been renewed several times and remains in place as of 2022.

In March 2010, Atlas Air was awarded the contract to operate the Boeing Dreamlifter (officially the Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter), transporting aircraft parts to Boeing from suppliers around the world. It commenced operation in September 2010 under a CMI contract. In 2011, Atlas Air took the first North American delivery of the Boeing 747-8 Freighter (Boeing 747-8F).

On April 7, 2016, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings purchased Southern Air for in an all-cash deal. The transaction included Worldwide Air Logistics Group, Inc. and its two operating subsidiaries, Southern Air, Inc. and Florida West International Airways, Inc. On May 5, 2016, Amazon.com and Atlas Air announced a deal for Amazon.com to lease 20 Boeing 767s to fuel growth of its new Amazon air-freight service, branded as Amazon Air. The deal also warranted Amazon the ability to buy up to 30% stake in the company over the next seven years. Under the agreement, Atlas Air Inc. would provide aircraft and CMI for seven years. This move came after Amazon&#x27;s similar deal with Air Transport Services Group for 20 aircraft, also to be branded under Amazon Air. In March 2017, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings shut down Florida West International Airways and cancelled the operating certificate.

In January 2021, Atlas Air announced the purchase of an additional four 747-8 freighters from Boeing. They were the final four 747s to be built. These were to be delivered in 2022, when Boeing planned to shut the 747 production program. On November 17, 2021, Atlas Air and Southern Air completed their merger with the transition to a single operating certificate. On August 4, 2022, Atlas agreed to be bought by an investor group for $3.2 billion.

On January 31, 2023, the airline received the 1,574th and final 747 ever made - a 747-8F registered N863GT. As the last 747 to be made by Boeing, the aircraft features a decal of Joe Sutter, the designer of the 747, on the front, right side and the words &quot;forever incredible&quot;. Many Boeing employees and executives, including those who were part of the &quot;Incredibles,&quot; the people who worked on the first 747 prototype, gathered at Boeing&#x27;s Everett Plant to bid farewell to the final aircraft.

== Operations ==
Atlas Air&#x27;s headquarters are in White Plains, New York with a flight operations center located in Erlanger, Kentucky. Atlas Air operates flights on an aircraft &amp; CMI and air charter basis for airlines, express operators, freight forwarders, charter brokers, global shippers, and the U.S. military, along with dry-leasing freighter aircraft. Atlas Air has global operations established in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America. Crew bases are located at Anchorage–Ted Stevens; Chicago–O&#x27;Hare; Cincinnati; Los Angeles; Memphis; Miami; New York–JFK; Ontario, CA; and Tampa.

As of late 2023, Atlas Air operates MSC Air Cargo flights on behalf of the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), although MSC owns the aircraft and they are painted in MSC livery.

=== Passenger operations ===
Atlas Air began operating a premium passenger private-charter service for the U.S.-Africa Energy Association in conjunction with SonAir in 2010. The charter service consisted of two customized Boeing 747-400 aircraft provided by SonAir. The aircraft were configured to serve 189 passengers in a three-class configuration. The charter service, which became known as the &quot;Houston Express&quot;, included three dedicated weekly nonstop flights between Houston and Luanda, Angola. As of 2017, Atlas Air was the charter service for the Jacksonville Jaguars. As of 2021, Atlas Air owned a fleet of 10 B747 and B767 passenger aircraft available for lease in the passenger charter market.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* January 24, 2005: Atlas Air Flight 8995, a Boeing 747-212BSF, aircraft registration N808MC, overran the runway at Düsseldorf Airport due to poor braking action caused by unexpectedly heavy snow accumulation from an ongoing snowstorm. The aircraft was written off.
* July 23, 2006: Atlas Air Flight 6972: a Boeing 747-47UF, N418MC, involved in a runway incursion with United Airlines Flight 1015, a Boeing 737-322.
* February 2, 2008: Cargo aboard an Atlas Air Boeing 747-2D7B, N527MC, broke loose on takeoff from Lome Airport and penetrated the bulkhead, causing severe structural damage. The aircraft was written off.
* February 2010: The cover of part of the flaps on an Atlas Air Boeing 747 detached from the aircraft during landing in Miami, Florida. On May 17, 2010, a similar incident occurred when part of the inboard flaps on the right wing of an Atlas 747 separated from the aircraft. In May, alleging improper maintenance practices, the US Federal Aviation Administration proposed a fine of roughly against the airline.
* February 23, 2019: Atlas Air Flight 3591, a Boeing 767-375ER(BCF), N1217A, crashed into Trinity Bay near Houston on approach to George Bush Intercontinental Airport, killing both pilots and the single passenger, a commuting pilot from another airline. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the crash to pilot error and spatial disorientation; the NTSB also found that both pilots had experienced significant training difficulties and criticized Atlas Air&#x27;s hiring practices.
* January 18, 2024: Atlas Air Flight 95, flying from Miami International Airport to San Juan Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico and operated by a Boeing 747-8F, N859GT, returned to Miami approximately 15 minutes after departure after experiencing an engine malfunction, which the crew reported as an engine fire.

<doc id="144929" wikidata="Q189294" url="?curid=144929" title="Boron group">
<text>The boron group are the chemical elements in [[periodic table group|group 13]] of the periodic table, consisting of boron (B), aluminium (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), thallium (Tl) and nihonium (Nh). This group lies in the p-block of the periodic table. The elements in the boron group are characterized by having three valence electrons. These elements have also been referred to as the triels.

Several group 13 elements have biological roles in the ecosystem. Boron is a trace element in humans and is essential for some plants. Lack of boron can lead to stunted plant growth, while an excess can also cause harm by inhibiting growth. Aluminium has neither a biological role nor significant toxicity and is considered safe. Indium and gallium can stimulate metabolism; gallium is credited with the ability to bind itself to iron proteins. Thallium is highly toxic, interfering with the function of numerous vital enzymes, and has seen use as a pesticide.

==Characteristics==
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior:

The boron group is notable for trends in the electron configuration, as shown above, and in some of its elements&#x27; characteristics. Boron differs from the other group members in its hardness, refractivity and reluctance to participate in metallic bonding. An example of a trend in reactivity is boron&#x27;s tendency to form reactive compounds with hydrogen.

Although situated in p-block, the group is notorious for violation of the octet rule by its members boron and (to a lesser extent) aluminium. All members of the group are characterized as &quot;trivalent&quot;.

===Chemical reactivity===

====Hydrides====
Most of the elements in the boron group show increasing reactivity as the elements get heavier in atomic mass and higher in atomic number. Boron, the first element in the group, is generally unreactive with many elements except at high temperatures, although it is capable of forming many compounds with hydrogen, sometimes called &quot;boranes&quot;. The simplest borane is diborane, or B2H6. Another example is B10H14.

The next group-13 elements, aluminium and gallium, form fewer stable hydrides, although both AlH3 and GaH3 exist. Indium, the next element in the group, is not known to form many hydrides, except in complex compounds such as the phosphine complex (Cy=cyclohexyl). No stable compound of thallium and hydrogen has been synthesized in any laboratory.

====Oxides====
All of the boron-group elements are known to form a trivalent oxide, with two atoms of the element bonded covalently with three atoms of oxygen. These elements show a trend of increasing pH (from acidic to basic). Boron oxide (B2O3) is slightly acidic, aluminium and gallium oxide (Al2O3 and Ga2O3 respectively) are amphoteric, indium(III) oxide (In2O3) is nearly amphoteric, and thallium(III) oxide (Tl2O3) is a Lewis base because it dissolves in acids to form salts. Each of these compounds are stable, but thallium oxide decomposes at temperatures higher than 875 °C.

====Halides====
The elements in group 13 are also capable of forming stable compounds with the halogens, usually with the formula MX3 (where M is a boron-group element and X is a halogen.) Fluorine, the first halogen, is able to form stable compounds with every element that has been tested (except neon and helium), and the boron group is no exception. It is even hypothesized that nihonium could form a compound with fluorine, NhF3, before spontaneously decaying due to nihonium&#x27;s radioactivity. Chlorine also forms stable compounds with all of the elements in the boron group, including thallium, and is hypothesized to react with nihonium. All of the elements will react with bromine under the right conditions, as with the other halogens but less vigorously than either chlorine or fluorine. Iodine will react with all natural elements in the periodic table except for the noble gases, and is notable for its explosive reaction with aluminium to form AlI3. Astatine, the fifth halogen, has only formed a few compounds, due to its radioactivity and short half-life, and no reports of a compound with an At–Al, –Ga, –In, –Tl, or –Nh bond have been seen, although scientists think that it should form salts with metals. Tennessine, the sixth and final member of group 17, may also form compounds with the elements in the boron group; however, because Tennessine is purely synthetic and thus must be created artificially, its chemistry has not been investigated, and any compounds would likely decay nearly instantly after formation due to its extreme radioactivity.

===Physical properties===
It has been noticed that the elements in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron&#x27;s are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, all of the other elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron&#x27;s reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that all do have in common is having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and electrical insulator at room temperature, but a good conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.

===Oxidation states===
The inert s-pair effect is significant in the group-13 elements, especially the heavier ones like thallium. This results in a variety of oxidation states. In the lighter elements, the +3 state is the most stable, but the +1 state becomes more prevalent with increasing atomic number, and is the most stable for thallium. Boron is capable of forming compounds with lower oxidization states, of +1 or +2, and aluminium can do the same. Gallium can form compounds with the oxidation states +1, +2 and +3. Indium is like gallium, but its +1 compounds are more stable than those of the lighter elements. The strength of the inert-pair effect is maximal in thallium, which is generally only stable in the oxidation state of +1, although the +3 state is seen in some compounds. Stable and monomeric gallium, indium and thallium radicals with a formal oxidation state of +2 have since been reported. Nihonium may have +5 oxidation state.

===Periodic trends===
There are several trends that can be observed in the properties of the boron group members. The boiling points of these elements drop from period to period, while densities tend to rise.

===Nuclear===
With the exception of the synthetic nihonium, all of the elements of the boron group have stable isotopes. Because all their atomic numbers are odd, boron, gallium and thallium have only two stable isotopes, while aluminium and indium are monoisotopic, having only one, although most indium found in nature is the weakly radioactive 115In. 10B and 11B are both stable, as are 27Al, 69Ga and 71Ga, 113In, and 203Tl and 205Tl. All of these isotopes are readily found in macroscopic quantities in nature. In theory, though, all isotopes with an atomic number greater than 66 are supposed to be unstable to alpha decay. Conversely, all elements with atomic numbers are less than or equal to 66 (except Tc, Pm, Sm and Eu) have at least one isotope that is theoretically energetically stable to all forms of decay (with the exception of proton decay, which has never been observed, and spontaneous fission, which is theoretically possible for elements with atomic numbers greater than 40).

Like all other elements, the elements of the boron group have radioactive isotopes, either found in trace quantities in nature or produced synthetically. The longest-lived of these unstable isotopes is the indium isotope 115In, with its extremely long half-life of . This isotope makes up the vast majority of all naturally occurring indium despite its slight radioactivity. The shortest-lived is 7B, with a half-life of a mere , being the boron isotope with the fewest neutrons and a enough to measure. Some radioisotopes have important roles in scientific research; a few are used in the production of goods for commercial use or, more rarely, as a component of finished products.

==History==
The boron group has had many names over the years. According to former conventions it was Group IIIB in the European naming system and Group IIIA in the American. The group has also gained two collective names, &quot;earth metals&quot; and &quot;triels&quot;. The latter name is derived from the Latin prefix &quot;tri-&quot; (&quot;three&quot;) and refers to the three valence electrons that all of these elements, without exception, have in their valence shells. The name &quot;triels&quot; was first suggested by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1970.

Boron was known to the ancient Egyptians, but only in the mineral borax. The metalloid element was not known in its pure form until 1808, when Humphry Davy was able to extract it by the method of electrolysis. Davy devised an experiment in which he dissolved a boron-containing compound in water and sent an electric current through it, causing the elements of the compound to separate into their pure states. To produce larger quantities he shifted from electrolysis to reduction with sodium. Davy named the element &quot;boracium&quot;. At the same time two French chemists, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard, used iron to reduce boric acid. The boron they produced was oxidized to boron oxide.

Aluminium, like boron, was first known in minerals before it was finally extracted from alum, a common mineral in some areas of the world. Antoine Lavoisier and Humphry Davy had each separately tried to extract it. Although neither succeeded, Davy had given the metal its current name. It was only in 1825 that the Danish scientist Hans Christian Ørsted successfully prepared a rather impure form of the element. Many improvements followed, a significant advance being made just two years later by Friedrich Wöhler, whose slightly modified procedure still yielded an impure product. The first pure sample of aluminium is credited to Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, who substituted sodium for potassium in the procedure. At that time aluminium was considered precious, and it was displayed next to such metals as gold and silver. The method used today, electrolysis of aluminium oxide dissolved in cryolite, was developed by Charles Martin Hall and Paul Héroult in the late 1880s.

Thallium, the heaviest stable element in the boron group, was discovered by William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy in 1861. Unlike gallium and indium, thallium had not been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev, having been discovered before Mendeleev invented the periodic table. As a result, no one was really looking for it until the 1850s when Crookes and Lamy were examining residues from sulfuric acid production. In the spectra they saw a completely new line, a streak of deep green, which Crookes named after the Greek word θαλλός (), referring to a green shoot or twig. Lamy was able to produce larger amounts of the new metal and determined most of its chemical and physical properties.

Indium is the fourth element of the boron group but was discovered before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking in a sample of the mineral zinc blende, also known as sphalerite (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed the lines that appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.

Gallium minerals were not known before August 1875, when the element itself was discovered. It was one of the elements that the inventor of the periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev, had predicted to exist six years earlier. While examining the spectroscopic lines in zinc blende the French chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran found indications of a new element in the ore. In just three months he was able to produce a sample, which he purified by dissolving it in a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution and sending an electric current through it. The next month he presented his findings to the French Academy of Sciences, naming the new element after the Greek name for Gaul, modern France.

The last confirmed element in the boron group, nihonium, was not discovered but rather created or synthesized. The element&#x27;s synthesis was first reported by the Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research team in Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, though it was the Dubna team who successfully conducted the experiment in August 2003. Nihonium was discovered in the decay chain of moscovium, which produced a few precious atoms of nihonium. The results were published in January of the following year. Since then around 13 atoms have been synthesized and various isotopes characterized. However, their results did not meet the stringent criteria for being counted as a discovery, and it was the later RIKEN experiments of 2004 aimed at directly synthesizing nihonium that were acknowledged by IUPAC as the discovery.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;boron&quot; comes from the Arabic word for the mineral borax, (بورق, &quot;boraq&quot;) which was known before boron was ever extracted. The &quot;-on&quot; suffix is thought to have been taken from &quot;carbon&quot;. Aluminium was named by Humphry Davy in the early 1800s. It is derived from the Greek word &quot;alumen&quot;, meaning bitter salt, or the Latin &quot;alum&quot;, the mineral. Gallium is derived from the Latin &quot;Gallia&quot;, referring to France, the place of its discovery. Indium comes from the Latin word &quot;indicum&quot;, meaning indigo dye, and refers to the element&#x27;s prominent indigo spectroscopic line. Thallium, like indium, is named after the Greek word for the color of its spectroscopic line: , meaning a green twig or shoot. &quot;Nihonium&quot; is named after Japan (&quot;Nihon&quot; in Japanese), where it was discovered.

==Occurrence and abundance==

===Boron===

Boron, with its atomic number of 5, is a very light element. Almost never found free in nature, it is very low in abundance, composing only 0.001% (10 ppm) of the Earth&#x27;s crust. It is known to occur in over a hundred different minerals and ores, however: the main source is borax, but it is also found in colemanite, boracite, kernite, tusionite, berborite and fluoborite. Major world miners and extractors of boron include Turkey, the United States, Argentina, China, Bolivia and Peru. Turkey is by far the most prominent of these, accounting for around 70% of all boron extraction in the world. The United States is second, most of its yield coming from the state of California.

===Aluminium===
Aluminium, in contrast to boron, is the most abundant metal in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and the third most abundant element. It composes about 8.2% (82,000 ppm) of the Earth&#x27;s crust, surpassed only by oxygen and silicon. It is like boron, however, in that it is uncommon in nature as a free element. This is due to aluminium&#x27;s tendency to attract oxygen atoms, forming several aluminium oxides. Aluminium is now known to occur in nearly as many minerals as boron, including garnets, turquoises and beryls, but the main source is the ore bauxite. The world&#x27;s leading countries in the extraction of aluminium are Ghana, Suriname, Russia and Indonesia, followed by Australia, Guinea and Brazil.

===Gallium===
Gallium is a relatively rare element in the Earth&#x27;s crust and is not found in as many minerals as its lighter homologues. Its abundance on the Earth is a mere 0.0018% (18 ppm). Its production is very low compared to other elements, but has increased greatly over the years as extraction methods have improved. Gallium can be found as a trace in a variety of ores, including bauxite and sphalerite, and in such minerals as diaspore and germanite. Trace amounts have been found in coal as well.
The gallium content is greater in a few minerals, including gallite (CuGaS2), but these are too rare to be counted as major sources and make negligible contributions to the world&#x27;s supply.

===Indium===
Indium is another rare element in the boron group at only 0.000005% (0.05 ppm). Very few indium-containing minerals are known, all of them scarce: an example is indite. Indium is found in several zinc ores, but only in minute quantities; likewise some copper and lead ores contain traces. As is the case for most other elements found in ores and minerals, the indium extraction process has become more efficient in recent years, ultimately leading to larger yields. Canada is the world&#x27;s leader in indium reserves, but both the United States and China have comparable amounts.

===Thallium===

Thallium is of intermediate abundance in the Earth&#x27;s crust, estimated to be 0.00006% (0.6 ppm). It is found on the ground in some rocks, in the soil and in clay. Many sulfide ores of iron, zinc and cobalt contain thallium. In minerals it is found in moderate quantities: some examples are crookesite (in which it was first discovered), lorandite, routhierite, bukovite, hutchinsonite and sabatierite. There are other minerals that contain small amounts of thallium, but they are very rare and do not serve as primary sources.

===Nihonium===
Nihonium is an element that is never found in nature but has been created in a laboratory. It is therefore classified as a synthetic element with no stable isotopes.

==Applications==
With the exception of synthetic nihonium, all the elements in the boron group have numerous uses and applications in the production and content of many items.

=== Boron ===

Boron has found many industrial applications in recent decades, and new ones are still being found. A common application is in fiberglass. There has been rapid expansion in the market for borosilicate glass; most notable among its special qualities is a much greater resistance to thermal expansion than regular glass. Another commercially expanding use of boron and its derivatives is in ceramics. Several boron compounds, especially the oxides, have unique and valuable properties that have led to their substitution for other materials that are less useful. Boron may be found in pots, vases, plates, and ceramic pan-handles for its insulating properties.

The compound borax is used in bleaches, for both clothes and teeth. The hardness of boron and some of its compounds give it a wide array of additional uses. A small part (5%) of the boron produced finds use in agriculture.

=== Aluminium ===

Aluminium is a metal with numerous familiar uses in everyday life. It is most often encountered in construction materials, in electrical devices, especially as the conductor in cables, and in tools and vessels for cooking and preserving food. Aluminium&#x27;s lack of reactivity with food products makes it particularly useful for canning. Its high affinity for oxygen makes it a powerful reducing agent. Finely powdered pure aluminium oxidizes rapidly in air, generating a huge amount of heat in the process (burning at about or ), leading to applications in welding and elsewhere that a large amount of heat is needed. Aluminium is a component of alloys used for making lightweight bodies for aircraft. Cars also sometimes incorporate aluminium in their framework and body, and there are similar applications in military equipment. Less common uses include components of decorations and some guitars. The element is also sees use in a diverse range of electronics.

=== Gallium ===
Gallium and its derivatives have only found applications in recent decades. Gallium arsenide has been used in semiconductors, in amplifiers, in solar cells (for example in satellites) and in tunnel diodes for FM transmitter circuits. Gallium alloys are used mostly for dental purposes. Gallium ammonium chloride is used for the leads in transistors. A major application of gallium is in LED lighting. The pure element has been used as a dopant in semiconductors, and has additional uses in electronic devices with other elements. Gallium has the property of being able to &#x27;wet&#x27; glass and porcelain, and thus can be used to make mirrors and other highly reflective objects. Gallium can be added to alloys of other metals to lower their melting points.

=== Indium ===

Indium&#x27;s uses can be divided into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the production is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode-ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.

=== Thallium ===

Thallium is used in its elemental form more often than the other boron-group elements. Uncompounded thallium is used in low-melting glasses, photoelectric cells, switches, mercury alloys for low-range glass thermometers, and thallium salts. It can be found in lamps and electronics, and is also used in myocardial imaging. The possibility of using thallium in semiconductors has been researched, and it is a known catalyst in organic synthesis. Thallium hydroxide (TlOH) is used mainly in the production of other thallium compounds. Thallium sulfate (Tl2SO4) is an outstanding vermin-killer, and it is a principal component in some rat and mouse poisons. However, the United States and some European countries have banned the substance because of its high toxicity to humans. In other countries, though, the market for the substance is growing. Tl2SO4 is also used in optical systems.

==Biological role==
None of the group-13 elements has a major biological role in complex animals, but some are at least associated with a living being. As in other groups, the lighter elements usually have more biological roles than the heavier. The heaviest ones are toxic, as are the other elements in the same periods. Boron is essential in most plants, whose cells use it for such purposes as strengthening cell walls. It is found in humans, certainly as a essential trace element, but there is ongoing debate over its significance in human nutrition. Boron&#x27;s chemistry does allow it to form complexes with such important molecules as carbohydrates, so it is plausible that it could be of greater use in the human body than previously thought. Boron has also been shown to be able to replace iron in some of its functions, particularly in the healing of wounds. Aluminium has no known biological role in plants or animals, despite its widespread occurrence in nature. Gallium is not essential for the human body, but its relation to iron(III) allows it to become bound to proteins that transport and store iron. Gallium can also stimulate metabolism. Indium and its heavier homologues have no biological role, although indium salts in small doses, like gallium, can stimulate metabolism.

==Toxicity==
Each element of the boron group has a unique toxicity profile to plants and animals.

As an example of boron toxicity, it has been observed to harm barley in concentrations exceeding 20 mM. The symptoms of boron toxicity are numerous in plants, complicating research: they include reduced cell division, decreased shoot and root growth, decreased production of leaf chlorophyll, inhibition of photosynthesis, lowering of stomata conductance, reduced proton extrusion from roots, and deposition of lignin and suberin.

Aluminium does not present a prominent toxicity hazard in small quantities, but very large doses are slightly toxic. Gallium is not considered toxic, although it may have some minor effects. Indium is not toxic and can be handled with nearly the same precautions as gallium, but some of its compounds are slightly to moderately toxic.

Thallium, unlike gallium and indium, is extremely toxic, and has caused many poisoning deaths. Its most noticeable effect, apparent even from tiny doses, is hair loss all over the body, but it causes a wide range of other symptoms, disrupting and eventually halting the functions of many organs. The nearly colorless, odorless and tasteless nature of thallium compounds has led to their use by murderers. The incidence of thallium poisoning, intentional and accidental, increased when thallium (with its similarly toxic compound, thallium sulfate) was introduced to control rats and other pests. The use of thallium pesticides has therefore been prohibited since 1975 in many countries, including the USA.

Nihonium is a highly unstable element and decays by emitting alpha particles. Due to its strong radioactivity, it would definitely be extremely toxic, although significant quantities of nihonium (larger than a few atoms) have not yet been assembled.

<text>James Mark Baldwin (January 12, 1861 – November 8, 1934) was an American philosopher and psychologist who was educated at Princeton under the supervision of Scottish philosopher James McCosh and who was one of the founders of the Department of Psychology at Princeton and the University of Toronto. He made important contributions to early psychology, psychiatry, and to the theory of evolution.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baldwin was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. His father, who was from Connecticut, was an abolitionist and was known to purchase slaves in order to free them. During the Civil War his father moved north, but the family remained in their home until the time of Sherman&#x27;s March. Upon their return after the war, Baldwin&#x27;s father was part of the Reconstruction Era government. Baldwin was sent north to receive his secondary education in New Jersey. As a result, he chose to attend the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).

Baldwin started in theology under the tutelage of the college&#x27;s president, James McCosh, but soon switched to philosophy, completing a B.A. in 1884. He was awarded the Green Fellowship in Mental Science (named after his future father-in-law, the head of the Princeton Theological Seminary) and used it to study in Germany with Wilhelm Wundt at Leipzig and with Friedrich Paulsen at Berlin during the following year.

In 1886 he became Instructor in French and German at the Princeton Theological Seminary. He translated Théodule-Armand Ribot&#x27;s &quot;German Psychology of Today&quot; and wrote his first paper &quot;The Postulates of a Physiological Psychology&quot;. Ribot&#x27;s work traced the origins of psychology from Immanuel Kant through Johann Friedrich Herbart, Gustav Theodor Fechner, Hermann Lotze to Wundt.

In 1887, while working as a professor of philosophy at Lake Forest College, he married Helen Hayes Green, the daughter of the president of the seminary, William Henry Green. At Lake Forest, he published the first part of his &quot;Handbook of Psychology (Senses and Intellect)&quot; in which he directed attention to the new experimental psychology of Ernst Heinrich Weber, Fechner and Wundt. He also completed his master&#x27;s degree from Princeton. In 1889, he completed his doctoral degree, also from Princeton.

In 1890 he went to the University of Toronto as the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics. His creation of a laboratory of experimental psychology at Toronto (which he claimed was the first in the British Empire) coincided with the birth of his daughters Helen (1889) and Elizabeth (1891) which inspired the quantitative and experimental research on infant development that was to make such a vivid impression on Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg through Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes&quot; (1894) dedicated to the subject. A second part of &quot;Handbook of Psychology (Feeling and Will)&quot; appeared in 1891.

During this creative phase Baldwin traveled to France (1892) to visit the important psychologists Jean-Martin Charcot (at the Salpêtrière), Hippolyte Bernheim (at Nancy), and Pierre Janet.

===Mid-career===
In 1893 he was called back to his alma mater, Princeton University, where he was offered the Stuart Chair in Psychology and the opportunity to establish a new psychology laboratory. He would stay at Princeton until 1903 working out the highlights of his career reflected in &quot;Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology&quot; (1897) where he took his previous &quot;Mental Development&quot; to the critical stage in which it survived in the work of Lev Vygotsky, through Vygotsky in the crucial work of Alexander Luria, and in the synthesis of both by Aleksey Leontyev. He also edited the English editions of Karl Groos&#x27;s &quot;Play of Animals&quot; (1898) and &quot;Play of Men&quot; (1901).

It was during this time that Baldwin wrote &quot;A New Factor in Evolution&quot; (June 1896/&quot;The American Naturalist&quot;) which later became known as the &quot;Baldwin Effect&quot;. But other important contributors should not be overlooked. Conwy Lloyd Morgan was perhaps closest to understanding the so-called &quot;Baldwin Effect&quot;. In his &quot;Habit and Instinct&quot; (1896) he phrased a comparable version of the theory, as he did in an address to a session of the New York Academy of Sciences (February 1896) in the presence of Baldwin. (1896/&quot;Of modification and variation&quot;.&quot; Science&quot; 4(99) (November 20):733-739). As did Henry Fairfield Osborn (1896/&quot;A mode of evolution requiring neither natural selection nor the inheritance of acquired characteristics&quot;. &quot;Transactions of the New York Academy of Science&quot; 15:141-148). The &quot;Baldwin Effect&quot;, building in part on the principle of &quot;organic selection&quot; proposed by Baldwin in &quot;Mental Development&quot; did only receive its name from George Gaylord Simpson in 1953. (in: &quot;Evolution&quot; 7:110-117) (see: David J. Depew in &quot;Evolution and Learning&quot; M.I.T. 2003)

Baldwin complemented his psychological work with philosophy, in particular epistemology his contribution to which he presented in the presidential address to the American Psychological Association in 1897. By then the work on the &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology&quot; (1902) had been announced and a period of intense philosophical correspondence ensued with the contributors to the project: William James, John Dewey, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, George Edward Moore, Bernard Bosanquet, James McKeen Cattell, Edward B. Titchener, Hugo Münsterberg, Christine Ladd-Franklin, Adolf Meyer, George Stout, Franklin Henry Giddings, Edward Bagnall Poulton and others.

In 1897, Baldwin was also elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1899 Baldwin went to Oxford to supervise the completion of the &quot;Dictionary&quot;... (1902). He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Science at Oxford University. (In the light of the foregoing, the deafening silence with which J. M. Baldwin was later treated in Oxford publications on the mind may well come to be regarded as one of the significant omissions in the history of ideas for the 20th century. Compare for example Richard Gregory: &quot;The Oxford Companion to the Mind&quot;, first edition, 1987.)

===Later life===
In 1903, partly as a result of a dispute with Princeton president Woodrow Wilson and in part due to an offer involving more pay and less teaching, he moved to a professorship of philosophy and psychology at Johns Hopkins University. Here, he re-opened the experimental laboratory that had been founded by G. Stanley Hall in 1884 (but had closed with Hall&#x27;s departure to take over the presidency of Clark University in 1888).

In Baltimore Baldwin started to work on &quot;Thoughts and Things: A Study of the Development and Meaning of Thought, Or Genetic Logic&quot; (1906), a densely integrative rendering of his ideas culminating in &quot;Genetic Theory of Reality: Being the Outcome of Genetic Logic as Issuing in the Aesthetic Theory of Reality called Pancalism&quot; (1915). This book introduced the concept that knowledge grows through childhood in a series of distinct stages that involve interaction between innate abilities and environmental feedback, a proposal that was taken back by Piaget. He further stated that the initial physical development gives way to language and cognitive abilities such that the child emerges as a result of social and physical growth.

In Baltimore also Baldwin was arrested in a raid on a &quot;colored&quot; brothel (1908), a scandal that put an end to his American career. Forced to leave Johns Hopkins, he looked for residence in Paris. He was to reside in France till his death in 1934.

His first years (1908–1912) in France were interrupted by long stays in Mexico where he advised on university matters and lectured at the School of Higher Studies at the National University in Mexico City. His &quot;Darwin and the Humanities&quot; (1909) and &quot;Individual and Society&quot; (1911) date from this period.
In 1912 he took permanent residence in Paris.

Baldwin&#x27;s residence in France resulted in his pointing out the urgency of American non-neutral support for his new hosts on the French battlefields of World War I. He published &quot;American Neutrality, Its Cause and Cure&quot; (1916) for the purpose, and when in 1916 he survived a German torpedo attack on the in the English Channel – on the return trip from a visit to William Osler at Oxford – his open telegram to the president of the United States on the affair became frontpage news (&quot;New York Times&quot;). With the entry of America in the war (1917) he helped to organize the Paris branch of the American Navy League, acting as its Chairman till 1922. In 1926 his memoirs &quot;Between Two Wars (1861-1921)&quot; were published. He died in Paris on November 8, 1934.

==Ideas==
Baldwin was prominent among early experimental psychologists and was voted by his peers as the fifth most important psychologist in America in a 1903 survey conducted by James McKeen Cattell, but it was his contributions to developmental psychology that were the most important. His stepwise theory of cognitive development was a major influence on the later, and much more widely known, developmental theory of Jean Piaget. His ideas on the relationship of Ego and Alter were developed by Pierre Janet; while his stress on how &quot;My sense of self grows by imitation of you...an imitative creation&quot; contributed to the mirror stage of Jacques Lacan.

His contributions to the young discipline&#x27;s early journals and institutions were highly significant as well. Baldwin was a co-founder (with James McKeen Cattell) of &quot;Psychological Review&quot; (which was founded explicitly to compete with G. Stanley Hall&#x27;s &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot;), &quot;Psychological Monographs&quot; and &quot;Psychological Index.&quot; He was also the founding editor of &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;.

In 1892 he was vice-president of the International Congress of Psychology held in London, and in 1897–1898 president of the American Psychological Association; he received a gold medal from the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences of Denmark (1897), and was honorary president of the International Congress of Criminal Anthropology held in Geneva in 1896.

===Organic selection===
The idea of organic selection came from the interpretation of the observable data in Baldwin&#x27;s experimental study of infant reaching and its role in mental development. Every practice of the infant&#x27;s movement intended to advance the integration of behavior favorable to development in the experimental framework appeared to be selected from an excess of movement in the trial of imitation.

In further stages of development – the ones most critical to an understanding of the evolution of mind – this was graphically illustrated in the child&#x27;s efforts to draw and learning to write. (&quot;Mental Development in the Child and the Race&quot;)

In later editions of &quot;Mental Development&quot; Baldwin changed the term &quot;&quot;organic&quot; selection&quot; into &quot;&quot;functional&quot; selection&quot;.

So, from the outset the idea was well linked to the philosophy of mind Baldwin was emancipating from the models inspired by divine pre-establishment. (Spinoza) (Wozniak, 2001)

It is the communication of this insight into the practice-related nature of dynamogenic development, above all its integration as a creative factor in the fabric of society, that helped the students of Baldwin to understand what was left of Lamarck&#x27;s signature. Singularly illustrated by Gregory Bateson in &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; (1979) and reintegrated in contemporary studies by Terrence Deacon (&quot;The Symbolic Species: The co-evolution of language and the human brain&quot;, 1997) and other scholars of biosemiotics.

In the human species the faculty of niche building is favored by a practical intelligence able to design the circumstances that will put its vital acquirements out of harm&#x27;s way in terms of (linearly predicted) natural selection. It is precisely in the fields of study relating to massive selection pressures against which other species seem to be without defenses – biological development in the face of novel pandemics (AIDS, mad cow disease) – that the arguments relative to the natural heredity of intelligent acquirements have resurfaced in a way most challenging to science.

===Baldwin effect===

Baldwin&#x27;s most important theoretical legacy is the concept of the Baldwin effect or &quot;Baldwinian evolution&quot;. Baldwin proposed, against the neo-Lamarckians of his day (most notably Edward Drinker Cope), that there is a mechanism whereby epigenetic factors come to shape the congenital endowment as much as – or more than – natural selection pressures. In particular, human behavioral decisions made and sustained across generations as a set of cultural practices ought to be considered among the factors shaping the human genome.

For example, the incest taboo, if powerfully enforced, removes the natural selection pressure against the possession of incest-favoring instincts. After a few generations without this natural selection pressure, unless such genetic material were profoundly fixed, it would tend to diversify and lose its function. Humans would no longer be innately averse to incest, but would rely on their capacity to internalize such rules from cultural practices.

The opposite case can also be true: cultural practice might selectively breed humans to meet the fitness conditions of new environments, cultural and physical, which earlier hominids could not have survived. Baldwinian evolution might strengthen or weaken a genetic trait.

==Influence==
Baldwin&#x27;s contribution to this field places him at the heart of contemporary controversies in the fields of evolutionary psychology and wider sociobiology. Few people did more than Robert Wozniak, Professor of Psychology at Bryn Mawr College, for the rediscovery of the significance of James Mark Baldwin in the history of ideas.

==Work==
Apart from articles in the &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, Baldwin wrote:
*&quot;Handbook of Psychology&quot; (1890), translation of Ribot&#x27;s &quot;German Psychology of To-day&quot; (1886);
*&quot;Elements of Psychology&quot; (1893);
*&quot;Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development&quot; (1898);
*&quot;Story of the Mind&quot; (1898);
*&quot;Mental Development in the Child and the Race&quot; (1896);
*&quot;Thought and Things&quot; (London and New York, 1906).

He also largely contributed to the &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology&quot; (1901–1905), of which he was editor in-chief.

<text>Fang Shilong (born Chan Kong-sang; 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie Chan, is a Hong Kong actor, filmmaker, martial artist, and stuntman. On-screen, he is known for his slapstick, acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and innovative stunts, which he typically performs himself. Before entering the film industry, he was one of the Seven Little Fortunes from the China Drama Academy at the Peking Opera School, where he studied acrobatics, martial arts, and acting. In a film career spanning more than sixty years, he has appeared in over 150 domestic and international movies. Chan is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential martial artists in the history of cinema.

After appearing in many Hong Kong films as a stuntman, Chan&#x27;s first major breakthrough was the 1978 kung fu action comedy film &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;. He then starred in similar kung fu action comedy films such as 1978&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Master&quot; and 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Young Master&quot;. In 1979, he made his directorial debut with &quot;The Fearless Hyena&quot;, which was a box office success. Throughout the 1980s, he was part of the &quot;Three Dragons&quot; along with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao; the three starred in six Hong Kong films together. 1983&#x27;s &quot;Project A&quot; saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and established Chan&#x27;s signature style of elaborate, dangerous stunts combined with martial arts and slapstick humor, a style he further developed in a more modern setting with 1984&#x27;s &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;Police Story&quot;. &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; (1995), which had a successful worldwide theatrical run, brought Chan into the North American mainstream. He gained international fame for portraying Chief Inspector Lee in the American buddy cop action comedy film &quot;Rush Hour&quot; (1998), a role he reprised in two sequels.

Chan continued to work both in Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema, appearing in the well-received &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; (2000) and &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; (2003) in the &quot;Shanghai&quot; film series, &quot;New Police Story&quot; (2004), &quot;Rob-B-Hood&quot; (2006), &quot;Little Big Soldier&quot; (2010), and &quot;Shaolin&quot; (2011), among others. The US-China co-production &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot; (2008) marked his first collaboration with fellow martial arts star Jet Li. He has played martial arts mentor Mr. Han in two &quot;Karate Kid&quot; films, the 2010 remake &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Karate Kid: Legends&quot; (2025). For &quot;CZ12&quot; (2012), he earned two &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for &quot;Most Stunts Performed by a Living Actor&quot; and &quot;Most Credits in One Movie&quot;. He played against type in the well-received films &quot;Shinjuku Incident&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Foreigner&quot; (2017). His voice acting work includes all three Chinese versions of &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), the first three films in the &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; franchise (2008–2016), and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot; (2023). The animated television series &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; (2000–2005) focuses on a fictionalized version of Chan.

Chan is one of the most recognizable and influential film personalities in the world, with a widespread global following in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. He has received fame stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as well as an honorary Academy Award for his &quot;extraordinary achievements&quot; in film. Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, films, and video games. He is an operatically trained vocalist and is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of music albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred. He is also a globally known philanthropist and has been named one of the top 10 most charitable celebrities by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was perhaps the &quot;most recognized film star in the world.&quot; In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be $350 million, and , he was the second-highest-paid actor in the world.

== Early life ==
Chan was born on 7 April 1954 in British Hong Kong as Chan Kong-sang to Charles and Lee-lee Chan, political refugees from the Chinese Civil War. In circa 1937, Chan&#x27;s father, originally named Fang Daolong, briefly worked as a secret agent for Lieutenant General Dai Li, the chief spy in Kuomintang-ruled China. For fear of being arrested by the communist government, Chan&#x27;s father fled to British Hong Kong in the 1940s and changed his surname from Fang to Chan. Chan was his wife Chan Lee-lee&#x27;s surname. Chan discovered his father&#x27;s identity and changed his Chinese name to Fang Shilong () in the late 1990s, the name he would have been named according to his kin&#x27;s genealogy book, which allegedly traces back to Tang dynasty statesman Fang Xuanling. Chan&#x27;s ancestral roots are located in Wuhu, Anhui.

Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the French consul&#x27;s residence in the Victoria Peak, British Hong Kong, as his father worked as a cook there. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father emigrated to Canberra, Australia to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school&#x27;s best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo () in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, and the three of them later became known as the &quot;Three Brothers&quot; or &quot;Three Dragons&quot;. After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got the opportunity to train in hapkido under the grand master Jin Pal Kim, and Chan eventually attained a black belt. As a martial artist, Chan is also skilled in multiple forms of Kung fu. He is also known to have trained in other martial art forms such as Karate, Judo, Boxing, Taekwondo, and Jeet Kune Do.

Chan joined his parents in Canberra, Australia in 1971, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a construction worker. A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, thus earning Chan the nickname of &quot;Little Jack&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Jackie&quot;, which has stuck with him ever since.

== Film career ==
=== 1962–1975: Early small appearances ===
He began his film career by appearing in small roles at the age of five as a child actor. At age eight, he appeared with some of his fellow &quot;Little Fortunes&quot; in the film &quot;Big and Little Wong Tin Bar&quot; (1962) with Li Li-Hua playing his mother. The following year, the young actor appeared in extras of Yen Chun&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Liang Shan Po and Chu Ying Tai&quot; and had a small role in King Hu&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot;. In 1971, after an appearance as an extra in another kung Fu film, &quot;A Touch of Zen&quot;, Chan was signed to Chu Mu&#x27;s Great Earth Film Company.

Chan appeared in the Bruce Lee film &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1972), both as an extra and as a stunt double for the Japanese villain Hiroshi Suzuki (portrayed by Chikara Hashimoto), particularly during the final fight scene where Lee kicks him and he flies through the air. Chan again appeared in another Bruce Lee film, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973), as a minor henchman who gets killed by Lee&#x27;s character. Sammo Hung helped Chan get minor roles in both of the Bruce Lee films. Chan also worked as a martial arts choreographer for John Woo&#x27;s &quot;The Young Dragons&quot; (1974).

=== 1976–1980: Start-up leading roles ===
In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie&#x27;s stunt choreography work. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei. Lo saw Chan&#x27;s performance in the John Woo film &quot;Hand of Death&quot; (1976) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film &quot;New Fist of Fury&quot;. His stage name was changed to (literally &quot;becoming the dragon&quot;, &quot;Sing4 Lung4&quot; in Jyutping or rarely as &quot;Cheng Long&quot; in pinyin), to emphasize his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name meant &quot;Lee the Little Dragon&quot; in Chinese. (Note that &quot;dragon&quot; in Lee&#x27;s name referred to Lee&#x27;s birth year being the Dragon zodiac, not the Chinese dragon.) The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee&#x27;s martial arts style. Despite the film&#x27;s failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, but with little improvement at the box office.

Chan&#x27;s first major breakthrough was the 1978 film &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal. Director Yuen Woo-ping allowed Chan complete freedom over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved refreshing to the Hong Kong audience. The same year, Chan then starred in &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.

Upon Chan&#x27;s return to Lo Wei&#x27;s studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, producing and also showed new features at the time with Jackie as the Stunt Director &quot;Half a Loaf of Kung Fu&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Kung Fu&quot;. He also gave Chan the opportunity to make his directorial debut in &quot;The Fearless Hyena&quot;. When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei. During the shooting of &quot;Fearless Hyena Part II&quot;, Chan broke his contract and joined Golden Harvest, prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with triads, blaming Willie for his star&#x27;s departure. The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director Jimmy Wang Yu, allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.

=== 1980–1987: Commercial success in the action comedy genre ===
Willie Chan became Jackie&#x27;s personal manager and firm friend, and remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan&#x27;s international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s. His first Hollywood film was &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; in 1980. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film &quot;The Cannonball Run,&quot; which grossed over worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by North American audiences in favour of established American actors such as Burt Reynolds, Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.

After the commercial failure of &quot;The Protector&quot; in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to Hong Kong films.

Back in Hong Kong, Chan&#x27;s films began to reach a larger audience in East Asia, with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, &quot;The Young Master&quot; (1980) and &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; (1982). &quot;The Young Master&quot; went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema&#x27;s top star. With &quot;Dragon Lord&quot;, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences, including the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground.

Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in &quot;Project A,&quot; which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Over the following two years, the &quot;Three Brothers&quot; appeared in &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; and the original &quot;Lucky Stars&quot; trilogy. In 1985, Chan made the first &quot;Police Story&quot; film, a crime action film in which Chan performed a number of dangerous stunts. It won Best Film at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards. In 1986, Chan played &quot;Asian Hawk&quot;, an Indiana Jones-esque character, in the film &quot;Armour of God.&quot; The film was Chan&#x27;s biggest domestic box office success up to that point, grossing over HK$35 million.

=== 1988–1998: Acclaimed film sequels and Hollywood breakthrough ===
In 1988, Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date in the film &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;. Hung co-directed with Corey Yuen, and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah, both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with &quot;Project A Part II&quot; and &quot;Police Story 2&quot;, which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 Hong Kong Film Awards. This was followed by &quot;Armour of God II: Operation Condor&quot;, and &quot;Police Story 3: Super Cop&quot;, for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 Golden Horse Film Festival. In 1994, Chan reprised his role as Wong Fei-hung in &quot;Drunken Master II&quot;, which was listed in &quot;Time Magazine&quot;&#x27;s All-Time 100 Movies. Another sequel, &quot;Police Story 4: First Strike&quot;, brought more awards and domestic box office success for Chan, but did not fare as well in foreign markets.

By the mid-1990s, he was the most popular action movie star in Asia and Europe. Up until January 1995, his films had grossed over () in Hong Kong and () in Japan, while having sold over box office admissions in France, Germany, Italy and Spain up until then. Despite his international success, he was not very successful in North America, where he had only two wide releases as a leading actor, &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; and &quot;The Protector&quot;, grossing ( adjusted for inflation). Despite this, there was a thriving North American home video market for Chan&#x27;s Hong Kong films by the mid-1990s.

Chan rekindled his Hollywood ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being typecast in future roles. For example, Sylvester Stallone offered him the role of Simon Phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film &quot;Demolition Man&quot;. Chan declined and the role was taken by Wesley Snipes.

Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide release of &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;, attaining a cult following in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong movie stars. The success of &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; led to a 1996 release of &quot;Police Story 3: Super Cop&quot; in the United States under the title &quot;Supercop&quot;, which grossed a total of US$16,270,600. Chan&#x27;s first huge blockbuster success came when he co-starred with Chris Tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, grossing US$130 million in the United States alone. This film made him a Hollywood star, after which he wrote his autobiography in collaboration with Jeff Yang entitled &quot;I Am Jackie Chan&quot;.

=== 1999–2007: Fame in Hollywood and dramatization ===
In 1998, Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest, &quot;Who Am I?&quot;. After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in &quot;Gorgeous&quot;, a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences. Although Chan had left Golden Harvest in 1999, the company continued to produce and distribute for two of his films, &quot;Gorgeous&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Accidental Spy&quot; (2001). Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in 2000 called &quot;Jackie Chan Stuntmaster&quot;, to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture. He continued his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with Owen Wilson in the Western action comedy &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; followed in 2003 and also featured his first on-screen fight scene with Donnie Yen. He reunited with Chris Tucker for &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; (2001), which was an even bigger success than the original, grossing $347 million worldwide. Chan experimented with the use of special effects and wirework for the fight scenes in his next two Hollywood films, &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Medallion&quot; (2003), which were not as successful critically or commercially. In 2004, he teamed up with Steve Coogan in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, loosely based on Jules Verne&#x27;s novel of the same name. In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was &quot;perhaps&quot; the &quot;most recognized star in the world&quot;.

Despite the success of the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; and &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; films, Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the filmmaking process. In response to Golden Harvest&#x27;s withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, JCE Movies Limited (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with Emperor Multimedia Group (EMG). His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office; examples include &quot;New Police Story&quot; (2004), &quot;The Myth&quot; (2005) and the hit film &quot;Rob-B-Hood&quot; (2006).

Chan&#x27;s next release was the third instalment in the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; film series directed by Brett Ratner: &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; in August 2007. It grossed US$255 million. However, it was a disappointment in Hong Kong, grossing only HK$3.5 million during its opening weekend.

=== 2008–present: New experiments and change in acting style ===
Filming of &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot;, Chan&#x27;s first on-screen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li, was completed on 24 August 2007 and the movie was released in April 2008. The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires. Chan voiced Master Monkey in &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; (released in June 2008), appearing with Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and Angelina Jolie. In addition, he has assisted Anthony Szeto in an advisory capacity for the writer-director&#x27;s film &quot;Wushu&quot;, released on 1 May 2008. The film stars Sammo Hung and Wang Wenjie as father and son.

In November 2007, Chan began filming &quot;Shinjuku Incident&quot;, a dramatic role featuring no martial arts sequences with director Derek Yee, which sees Chan take on the role of a Chinese immigrant in Japan. The film was released on 2 April 2009. According to his blog, Chan discussed his wishes to direct a film after completing &quot;Shinjuku Incident&quot;, something he has not done for a number of years. The film was expected to be the third in the Armour of God series, and had a working title of &quot;Armour of God III: Chinese Zodiac&quot;. The film was released on 12 December 2012. Because the Screen Actors Guild did not go on strike, Chan started shooting his next Hollywood movie &quot;The Spy Next Door&quot; at the end of October in New Mexico. In &quot;The Spy Next Door&quot;, Chan plays an undercover agent whose cover is blown when he looks after the children of his girlfriend. In &quot;Little Big Soldier&quot;, Chan stars alongside Leehom Wang as a soldier in the Warring States period in China. He is the lone survivor of his army and must bring a captured enemy soldier Leehom Wang to the capital of his province.

In 2010, he starred with Jaden Smith in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, a remake of the 1984 original. This was Chan&#x27;s first dramatic American film. He plays Mr. Han, a kung fu master and maintenance man who teaches Jaden Smith&#x27;s character kung fu so he can defend himself from school bullies. His role in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; won him the Favorite Buttkicker award at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards in 2011. In Chan&#x27;s next movie, &quot;Shaolin&quot;, he plays a supporting role as a cook of a temple instead of one of the major characters.

His 100th movie, &quot;1911&quot;, was released on 26 September 2011. Chan was the co-director, executive producer, and lead star of the movie. While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this was his first directorial work since &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in 1998. &quot;1911&quot; premiered in North America on 14 October.

While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that he was getting too old for the genre. He later clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action films, but would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.

In 2013, Chan starred in &quot;Police Story 2013&quot;, a reboot of the &quot;Police Story&quot; franchise directed by Ding Sheng, and it was released in China at the end of 2013. Chan&#x27;s next film &quot;Dragon Blade&quot; was released in early 2015 and co-starred Hollywood actors John Cusack and Adrien Brody. In 2015, Chan was awarded the title of &quot;Datuk&quot; by Malaysia as he helped Malaysia to boost its tourism, especially in Kuala Lumpur where he previously shot his films. In early 2017, Chan&#x27;s new film titled &quot;Kung Fu Yoga&quot;, a Chinese-Indian project, which also starred Indian actors Disha Patani, Sonu Sood and Amyra Dastur, was released. The film reunited Chan with director Stanley Tong, who directed a number of Chan&#x27;s films in the 1990s. Upon release, the film was a huge success at the box office, and became the 5th highest-grossing film in China, one month after its release.

In 2016, he teamed up with Johnny Knoxville and starred in his own production &quot;Skiptrace&quot;. That same year he also starred in the action-comedy &quot;Railroad Tigers&quot;. In 2017, he co-starred with Pierce Brosnan in the action-thriller &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, an Anglo-Chinese production. He also starred in the 2017 science fiction film &quot;Bleeding Steel&quot;.

In 2018, he served as an executive producer for the plant-based documentary, &quot;The Game Changers&quot;, along with James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Pamela Anderson.

He teamed up with John Cena and starred in the 2023 Chinese-American co-production &quot;Hidden Strike&quot;.. He also voiced Splinter in the animated film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;.

His films had collectively grossed () at the Hong Kong box office up until 2010, over in South Korea between 1991 and 2010, and () in Japan up until 2012. In Europe, his films collectively sold about tickets between 1973 and 2010. , his films have grossed over () in China, and (more than adjusted for inflation) in the United States and Canada. , 48 of his films have collectively grossed more than at the worldwide box office.

== Other works ==

=== Music ===

Chan had vocal lessons while at the Peking Opera School in his childhood. He began producing records professionally in the 1980s and has gone on to become a successful singer in Hong Kong and Asia. He has released 20 albums since 1984 and has performed vocals in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Taiwanese and English. He often sings the theme songs of his films, which play over the closing credits. Chan&#x27;s first musical recording was &quot;Kung Fu Fighting Man&quot;, the theme song played over the closing credits of &quot;The Young Master&quot; (1980). At least 10 of these recordings have been released on soundtrack albums for the films. His Cantonese song &quot;Story of a Hero&quot; (英雄故事) (theme song of &quot;Police Story&quot;) was selected by the Royal Hong Kong Police and incorporated into their recruitment advertisement in 1994.

Chan voiced the character of Shang in the Chinese release of the Walt Disney animated feature &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998). He also performed the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot;, for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. For the US release, the speaking voice was performed by BD Wong and the singing voice was done by Donny Osmond. He also collaborated with Ani DiFranco on &quot;Unforgettable&quot;.

In 2007, Chan recorded and released &quot;We Are Ready&quot;, the official one-year countdown song to the 2008 Summer Olympics which he performed at a ceremony marking the one-year countdown to the 2008 Summer Paralympics. Chan also released one of the two official Olympics albums, &quot;Official Album for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games – Jackie Chan&#x27;s Version&quot;, which featured a number of special guest appearances. Chan performed &quot;Hard to Say Goodbye&quot; along with Andy Lau, Liu Huan and Wakin Chau, at the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

=== Academia ===
Chan received his honorary Doctorate of Social Science degree in 1996 from the Hong Kong Baptist University. In 2009, he received another honorary doctorate from the University of Cambodia, and has also been awarded an honorary professorship by the Savannah College of Art and Design in Hong Kong in 2008.

Chan is currently a faculty member of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where he teaches the subject of tourism management. , he also serves as the Dean of the Jackie Chan Film and Television Academy under the Wuhan Institute of Design and Sciences.

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Chan met Taiwanese actress Joan Lin. In December 1982, they married in Los Angeles; their son, Jaycee Chan, was born the day after. Lin retired from acting after their marriage, but made a cameo in &quot;CZ12&quot; (2012), in which she plays Chan&#x27;s wife.

Chan had an extramarital affair with Elaine Ng Yi-Lei, who gave birth to their daughter, Etta Ng Chok Lam, on January 18, 1999. Shortly before Etta&#x27;s birth, Ng publicly revealed Chan as the father, sparking a scandal. Chan held a press conference where he expressed regret over the affair but stated that he had &quot;only committed a fault that many men in the world commit&quot;. In 2002, Ng moved from Hong Kong to Shanghai. She and her daughter attracted media attention for their financial struggles, family conflicts, and mental health issues. However, according to her lawyer, Chan refused to provide any assistance. Chan has never met his daughter since her birth. In 2017, when asked about her coming out as lesbian, he replied: &quot;As long as she&#x27;s happy.&quot;

Chan speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and American Sign Language and also speaks some German, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai. Chan is an avid football fan and supports the Hong Kong national football team, the England national football team, and Manchester City.

He is a fan of the Italian duo Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, from whom he was inspired for his movies.

== Stunts and screen persona ==
Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. The team was established in 1983, and Chan has used them in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member&#x27;s abilities. Chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.

In the early 1980s, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in films such as &quot;The Young Master&quot; (1980) and especially &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; (1982), which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a backflip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. In 1983, &quot;Project A&quot; saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor; at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies. Critics have compared his comedic stunts in &quot;Project A&quot; to Buster Keaton, who was also known to perform his own stunts, although Chan himself had not watched Keaton&#x27;s films until years after &quot;Project A&quot; released; according to Chan, &quot;Project A&quot; was an evolution of the action stunt work he had been doing in earlier kung Fu comedy films since &quot;The Young Master&quot;.

&quot;Police Story&quot; (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase through a shanty town, Chan stopping a double-decker bus with his service revolver and a climactic fight scene in a shopping mall. This final scene earned the film the nickname &quot;Glass Story&quot; by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of sugar glass that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering second-degree burns, particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing. Chan performed similarly elaborate stunts in numerous other films, such as several &quot;Police Story&quot; sequels, &quot;Project A Part II&quot;, the &quot;Armour of God&quot; series, &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;, &quot;Drunken Master II&quot;, &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;, and the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; series, among others.

The dangerous nature of his stunts makes it difficult to get insurance, especially in the United States where his stunt work is contractually limited. Chan holds the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Stunts by a Living Actor&quot;, which emphasizes that &quot;no insurance company will underwrite Chan&#x27;s productions in which he performs all his own stunts&quot;.

Chan has been injured frequently when attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as bloopers during the closing credits of his films. He came closest to death filming &quot;Armour of God&quot; when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull. Over the years, he has dislocated his pelvis and also broken numerous parts of his body, including his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck, ankle, and ribs. Promotional materials for &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; emphasized that he performed all of the stunts, and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries.

Chan created his screen persona as a response to the late Bruce Lee and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee&#x27;s death. Lee&#x27;s characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee&#x27;s: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands American humor.

American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino classified Chan&#x27;s style of acting and filmmaking as physical comedy, and considered him one of the greatest in the genre. British filmmaker Edgar Wright describes Jackie Chan as an &quot;expressive&quot; visual performer with an everyman persona. He notes that, in contrast to other action heroes (such as Bruce Lee, Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger), Chan presents himself as a loveable &quot;goofball&quot; underdog who overcomes the odds with almost &quot;superhuman&quot; acrobatic stunts and fighting abilities.

In the 2000s, the ageing Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotion in his latest films. In &quot;New Police Story&quot; (2004), he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues. To further shed the image of a &quot;nice guy&quot;, Chan played an antihero for the first time in &quot;Rob-B-Hood&quot; (2006) starring as Thongs, a burglar with gambling problems. Chan plays a low-level gangster in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Shinjuku Incident&quot;, a serious drama set in Tokyo about unsavory characters.

== Legacy ==

Chan has received global recognition for his film acting and stunt work. His accolades include the Innovator Award from the American Choreography Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars. In addition, Chan has also been honored by placing his hand and footprints at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. Despite considerable box office success in Asia, Chan&#x27;s Hollywood films have been criticized with regard to their action choreography. Reviewers of &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, &quot;The Tuxedo&quot;, and &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; noted the toning down of Chan&#x27;s fighting scenes, citing less intensity compared to his earlier films. The comedic value of his films is questioned; some critics stating that they can be childish at times. Chan was awarded the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1989 and the Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) in 1999.

When American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino presented Chan with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1995 MTV Movie Awards, Tarantino described Chan as &quot;one of the best filmmakers the world has ever known&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest physical comedians since sound came into film.&quot;

In 2001, he was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.

=== Cultural impact ===
==== Film industry ====
Numerous films from around the world have taken inspiration from Jackie Chan&#x27;s fight sequences and action choreography. Examples include &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (both choreographed by his former colleague Yuen Woo-ping), the &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; series (where he also voiced Monkey), &quot;The Raid: Redemption&quot; (2011) from Indonesian cinema, &quot;&quot; (2014), the &quot;John Wick&quot; series, &quot;Atomic Blonde&quot; (2017), Marvel Cinematic Universe films such as &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018) and &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2020), and the Netflix film &quot;Extraction&quot; (2020). British filmmaker Edgar Wright cited Chan as an influence and said that, &quot;No matter how many people try and rip off Jackie Chan movies, there&#x27;s something which they can&#x27;t rip off which is Jackie Chan himself.&quot; Tom Holland also cited Chan as an influence on several action scenes in &quot;Uncharted&quot; (2022), noting Chan&#x27;s use of his surroundings to fight people in unique ways.

==== In popular culture and media ====
Chan has been the subject of Ash&#x27;s song &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, Heavy Vegetable&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Chan Is a Punk Rocker&quot;, Leehom Wang&#x27;s &quot;Long Live Chinese People&quot;, as well as in &quot;Jackie Chan&quot; by Frank Chickens, and television shows &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

He has been cited as the inspiration for manga and anime such as &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, which was particularly inspired by &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, and the fight scenes in Jackie Chan movies; the show pays homage with a character by the alias &quot;Jackie Chun&quot;. Toriyama said he had a young Jackie Chan in mind for a live-action Goku, stating that &quot;nobody could play Goku but him.&quot; Chan himself was a fan of the series, and had expressed some interest in adapting &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; into a live-action film, but said it would require &quot;a lot of amazing special effects and an enormous budget.&quot;

The parkour movement was also inspired by Chan.

A number of video games have been based on, or featured, Jackie Chan. His film &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (called &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan) spawned the hit 1984 beat &#x27;em up arcade game &quot;Spartan X&quot; (released as &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; in Western markets), and its sequel &quot;Spartan X 2&quot; for the Nintendo Famicom console. &quot;Spartan X&quot; laid the foundations for the beat &#x27;em up genre, and inspired other games including &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985) and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987). &quot;Jackie Chan&#x27;s Action Kung Fu&quot; was released in 1990 for the PC-Engine and Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1995, Chan was featured in the arcade game &quot;Jackie Chan The Kung-Fu Master&quot;. A series of Japanese video games were released on the MSX computer by Pony, based on several of Chan&#x27;s films (&quot;Project A&quot;, &quot;Project A 2&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;The Protector&quot; and &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot;). Other games based on Jackie Chan include &quot;Jackie Chan Stuntmaster&quot;, &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; and &quot;Jackie Chan J-Mat Fitness&quot;. Chan also inspired video game characters such as Lei Wulong in &quot;Tekken&quot; and the fighting-type Pokémon Hitmonchan.

On 25 June 2013, Chan responded to a hoax Facebook page created a few days earlier that alleged he had died. He said that several people contacted him to congratulate him on his recent engagement, and soon thereafter contacted him again to ask if he was still alive. He posted a Facebook message, commenting: &quot;If I died, I would probably tell the world!&quot;

In 2015, a made-up word inspired by Chan&#x27;s description of his hair during an interview for a commercial, &quot;duang&quot;, became an internet viral meme particularly in China. The Chinese character for the word is a composite of two characters of Chan&#x27;s name.

A wax figure of Jackie Chan was revealed at Madame Tussauds New York in 2020.
=== Public image ===
Jackie Chan has a sponsorship deal with Mitsubishi Motors that has resulted in the appearance of Mitsubishi cars in a number of his films. Furthermore, Mitsubishi launched a limited series of Evolution cars personally customized by Chan.

Chan was also the primary catalyst for the creation of review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, whose founder Senh Duong was his fan and created the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan&#x27;s Hong Kong action movies as they were being released in the United States. In anticipation for &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, Chan&#x27;s first major Hollywood crossover, he coded the website in two weeks and the site went live shortly before the release of &quot;Rush Hour&quot;.

Chan says he has always wanted to be a role model to children, and has remained popular with them due to his good-natured acting style. He has generally refused to play villains and has been very restrained in using swear words in his films – he persuaded the director of &quot;Rush Hour&quot; to take &quot;fuck&quot; out of the script. Chan&#x27;s greatest regret in life is not having received a proper education, inspiring him to fund educational institutions around the world. He funded the construction of the Jackie Chan Science Centre at the Australian National University and the establishment of schools in poor regions of China.

Chan is a spokesperson for the Government of Hong Kong, appearing in public service announcements. In a &quot;Clean Hong Kong&quot; commercial, he urged the people of Hong Kong to be more considerate with regards to littering, a problem that has been widespread for decades. Furthermore, in an advertisement promoting nationalism, he gave a short explanation of the March of the Volunteers, the national anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. When Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005, Chan participated in the opening ceremony. In the United States, Chan appeared alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in a government advert to combat copyright infringement and made another public service announcement with Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca to encourage people, especially Asian people, to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

=== Cultural honors and depictions ===
In November 2013, a statue of Chan was unveiled in front of what is now known as the JC Film Gallery, which opened in the spring of 2014.

On 1 February 2015, Chan was awarded the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the Territorial Crown by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia Tuanku Abdul Halim in conjunction with the country&#x27;s Federal Territory Day. It carries the title of Datuk in Malaysia.

== Political views and criticisms ==

Chan&#x27;s views on Hong Kong politics have gradually shifted from a pro-democratic stance in the late 1980s to a pro-Beijing stance in the 2010s. In 1989, Chan performed at the Concert for Democracy in China in support of democratic movement during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. By 2021, in contrast, he expressed his desire to join the Chinese Communist Party. Since 2013, Chan has been a pro-China politician, having served two terms as a delegate to the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, China&#x27;s political advisory body.

According to Chan, he wanted to be a Party member but his moral failings make him unqualified. Chan stated that he can &quot;see the greatness of the CCP&quot; and his view that &quot;[i]t will deliver what it says, and what it promises in less than 100 years, but only a few decades.&quot;

During a news conference in Shanghai on 28 March 2004, Chan referred to the recently concluded Republic of China 2004 presidential election in Taiwan, in which Democratic Progressive Party candidates Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu were re-elected as president and vice-president, as &quot;the biggest joke in the world&quot;. A Taiwanese legislator and senior member of the DPP, Parris Chang, called for the government of Taiwan to ban &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. Police and security personnel separated Chan from scores of protesters shouting &quot;Jackie Chan, get out&quot; when he arrived at Taipei airport in June 2008.

Referring to his participation in the torch relay for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide-ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government. He warned that &quot;publicity seekers&quot; planning to stop him from carrying the Olympic Torch &quot;not get anywhere near&quot; him. Chan also argued that the Olympics coverage that year would &quot;provide another way for us to tell the world about Chinese culture.&quot;

In 2009, Chan was named an &quot;anti-drug ambassador&quot; by the Chinese government, actively taking part in anti-drug campaigns and supporting President Hu Jintao&#x27;s declaration that illegal drugs should be eradicated, and their users punished severely. In 2014, when his own son Jaycee was arrested for cannabis use, he said that he was &quot;angry&quot;, &quot;shocked&quot;, &quot;heartbroken&quot; and &quot;ashamed&quot; of his son. He also remarked, &quot;I hope all young people will learn a lesson from Jaycee and stay far from the harm of drugs. I say to Jaycee that you have to accept the consequences when you do something wrong.&quot;

On 18 April 2009, during a panel discussion at the annual Boao Forum for Asia, he questioned whether or not broad freedom is a good thing. Noting the strong tensions in Hong Kong and Taiwan, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we&#x27;re not being controlled, we&#x27;ll just do what we want.&quot; Chan&#x27;s comments prompted angry responses from several prominent figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong. A spokesman later said Chan was referring to freedom in the entertainment industry, rather than in Chinese society at large.

In December 2012, Chan caused outrage when he criticized Hong Kong as a &quot;city of protest&quot;, suggesting that demonstrators&#x27; rights in Hong Kong should be limited. The same month, in an interview with Phoenix TV, Chan stated that the United States was the &quot;most corrupt&quot; country in the world, which in turn angered parts of the online community. Other articles situated Chan&#x27;s comments in the context of his career and life in the United States, including his &quot;embrace of the American film market&quot; and his seeking asylum in the United States from Hong Kong triads.

From 2013 to 2023, Chan served two terms as a member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, representing the &quot;Literature and Arts&quot; sector.

In April 2016, Chan was named in the Panama Papers. While Chan was not accused of engaging in illegal activity per se, he was listed as having up to six different offshore accounts, likely for the purposes of serving as tax shelters.

In 2019, Chan criticized Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests, saying that the Five-starred Red Flag&#x27; is respected everywhere around the world.&quot; He also supports the National People&#x27;s Congress decision on Hong Kong national security legislation.

== Entrepreneurship and philanthropy ==
In addition to his film production and distribution company, JCE Movies Limited, Jackie Chan owns or co-owns the production companies JC Group China, Jackie &amp; Willie Productions (with Willie Chan) and Jackie &amp; JJ Productions. Chan has also put his name to Jackie Chan Theater International, a cinema chain in China, co-run by Hong Kong company Sparkle Roll Group Ltd. The first—Jackie Chan-Yaolai International Cinema—opened in February 2010, and is claimed to be the largest cinema complex in China, with 17 screens and 3,500 seats. Chan expressed his hopes that the size of the venue would afford young, non-commercial directors the opportunity to have their films screened. Fifteen further cinemas in the chain were planned for 2010, throughout Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with a potential total of 65 cinemas throughout the country proposed.

In 2004, Chan launched his own line of clothing, which bears a Chinese dragon logo and the English word &quot;Jackie&quot;, or the initials &quot;JC&quot;. Chan also has a number of other branded businesses. His sushi restaurant chain, Jackie&#x27;s Kitchen, has outlets throughout Hong Kong, as well as seven in South Korea, with plans to open another in Las Vegas. Jackie Chan&#x27;s Cafe has outlets in Beijing, Singapore, and the Philippines. Other ventures include Jackie Chan Signature Club gyms (a partnership with California Fitness), and a line of chocolates, cookies and nutritional oatcakes. With each of his businesses, a percentage of the profits goes to various charities, including the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation.

In 2016, Chan partnered with Asian Le Mans Series champion David Cheng to form a racing team in the series and the FIA World Endurance Championship. The two met in March 2015 and Chan told Cheng about his interest in motorsports and raised the possibility of starting a team. Together, the two formed Baxi DC Racing Alpine, the first mainland China-based operation in WEC. In October, leading into the 2016–17 Asian Le Mans Series season, the team was rebranded to Jackie Chan DC Racing and raced with liveries promoting Chan&#x27;s movie &quot;Kung Fu Yoga&quot;. At the 2017 24 Hours of Le Mans, the team became the first Chinese team to win its class (LMP2).

Chan is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and has championed charitable works and causes. He has campaigned for conservation and against animal abuse, and has promoted disaster relief efforts for floods in mainland China and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

In June 2006, citing his admiration of the efforts made by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to help those in need, Chan pledged the donation of half his assets to charity upon his death. On 10 March 2008, Chan was the guest of honour for the launch, by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, of the &quot;Jackie Chan Science Centre&quot; at the John Curtin School of Medical Research of the Australian National University. Chan is also a supporter and ambassador of Save China&#x27;s Tigers, which aims to save the endangered South China tiger through breeding and releasing them into the wild.
Following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Chan donated RMB ¥10 million to help those in need. In addition, he planned to make a film about the Chinese earthquake to raise money for survivors. In response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Chan and fellow Hong Kong-based celebrities, including American rapper MC Jin, headlined a special three-hour charity concert, titled &quot;Artistes 311 Love Beyond Borders&quot;, on 1 April 2011 to help with Japan&#x27;s disaster recovery effort. The 3-hour concert raised over $3.3 million. In January 2017, Chan donated $65,000 to help flood victims in Thailand.

Chan founded the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation in 1988 to offer scholarship and active help to Hong Kong&#x27;s young people and provide aid to victims of natural disaster or illness. In 2005, Chan created the Dragon&#x27;s Heart Foundation to help children and the elderly in remote areas of China by building schools, providing books, fees, and uniforms for children; the organisation expanded its reach to Europe in 2011. The foundation also provides for the elderly with donations of warm clothing, wheelchairs, and other items.

=== Endorsements ===
One product which Chan had endorsed in China was the &quot;Little Tyrant&quot; (&quot;小霸王&quot;) produced by Subor, a Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone marketed as a &quot;learning machine&quot; to circumvent China&#x27;s then-ban on video game consoles. In 2010, Chan served as brand ambassador for Kaspersky Lab&#x27;s antivirus software in Asia.

There is an urban legend called the Jackie Chan curse. ABC News reported in 2010 that the legend originated because &quot;A slew of products sold in China bearing his name, smile and seal of approval have proven defective, prone to explosion, and in one case, potentially damaging to consumers&#x27; health.&quot; This led to a belief that any product or company which was endorsed by Jackie Chan would suffer setbacks. In 2016 the failure of fitness chain California Fitness was blamed on the curse. The curse was again invoked in 2021 when Evergrande Group suffered major losses following Chan&#x27;s promotion of Evergrande Spring brand bottled water. However, Jackie Chan has also endorsed a number of products and companies which have not had issues.

<doc id="144940" wikidata="Q626707" url="?curid=144940" title="Longitudinal wave">
<text>Longitudinal waves are waves which oscillate in the direction which is parallel to the direction in which the wave travels and displacement of the medium is in the same (or opposite) direction of the wave propagation. Mechanical longitudinal waves are also called &quot;compressional&quot; or compression waves, because they produce compression and rarefaction when travelling through a medium, and pressure waves, because they produce increases and decreases in pressure. A wave along the length of a stretched Slinky toy, where the distance between coils increases and decreases, is a good visualization. Real-world examples include sound waves (vibrations in pressure, a particle of displacement, and particle velocity propagated in an elastic medium) and seismic P waves (created by earthquakes and explosions).

The other main type of wave is the transverse wave, in which the displacements of the medium are at right angles to the direction of propagation. Transverse waves, for instance, describe &quot;some&quot; bulk sound waves in solid materials (but not in fluids); these are also called &quot;shear waves&quot; to differentiate them from the (longitudinal) pressure waves that these materials also support.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;Longitudinal waves&quot; and &quot;transverse waves&quot; have been abbreviated by some authors as &quot;L-waves&quot; and &quot;T-waves&quot;, respectively, for their own convenience.
While these two abbreviations have specific meanings in seismology (L-wave for Love wave or long wave) and electrocardiography (see T wave), some authors chose to use &quot;ℓ-waves&quot; (lowercase &#x27;L&#x27;) and &quot;t-waves&quot; instead, although they are not commonly found in physics writings except for some popular science books.

== Sound waves ==

For longitudinal harmonic sound waves, the frequency and wavelength can be described by the formula

:formula_1

where:
: formula_2 is the displacement of the point on the traveling sound wave;
: formula_3 is the distance from the point to the wave&#x27;s source;
: formula_4 is the time elapsed;
: formula_5 is the amplitude of the oscillations,
: formula_6 is the speed of the wave; and
: formula_7 is the angular frequency of the wave.

The quantity formula_8 is the time that the wave takes to travel the distance formula_9

The ordinary frequency (formula_10) of the wave is given by

:formula_11

The wavelength can be calculated as the relation between a wave&#x27;s speed and ordinary frequency.

:formula_12

For sound waves, the amplitude of the wave is the difference between the pressure of the undisturbed air and the maximum pressure caused by the wave.

Sound&#x27;s propagation speed depends on the type, temperature, and composition of the medium through which it propagates.

== Speed of longitudinal waves ==

=== Isotropic medium ===
For isotropic solids and liquids, the speed of a longitudinal wave can be described by
: formula_13
where
: formula_14 is the elastic modulus, such that formula_15
::: where formula_16 is the shear modulus and formula_17 is the bulk modulus;
: formula_18 is the mass density of the medium.

== Attenuation of longitudinal waves ==
The attenuation of a wave in a medium describes the loss of energy a wave carries as it propagates throughout the medium. This is caused by the scattering of the wave at interfaces, the loss of energy due to the friction between molecules, or geometric divergence. The study of attenuation of elastic waves in materials has increased in recent years, particularly within the study of polycrystalline materials where researchers aim to &quot;nondestructively evaluate the degree of damage of engineering components&quot; and to &quot;develop improved procedures for characterizing microstructures&quot; according to a research team led by R. Bruce Thompson in a &quot;Wave Motion&quot; publication.

=== Attenuation in viscoelastic materials ===
In viscoelastic materials, the attenuation coefficients per length formula_19 for longitudinal waves and formula_20 for transverse waves must satisfy the following ratio:

:formula_21

where formula_22 and formula_23 are the transverse and longitudinal wave speeds respectively.

=== Attenuation in polycrystalline materials ===
Polycrystalline materials are made up of various crystal grains which form the bulk material. Due to the difference in crystal structure and properties of these grains, when a wave propagating through a poly-crystal crosses a grain boundary, a scattering event occurs causing scattering based attenuation of the wave. Additionally it has been shown that the ratio rule for viscoelastic materials,
:formula_24
applies equally successfully to polycrystalline materials.

A current prediction for modeling attenuation of waves in polycrystalline materials with elongated grains is the second-order approximation (SOA) model which accounts the second order of inhomogeneity allowing for the consideration multiple scattering in the crystal system. This model predicts that the shape of the grains in a poly-crystal has little effect on attenuation.

== Pressure waves ==
The equations for sound in a fluid given above also apply to acoustic waves in an elastic solid. Although solids also support transverse waves (known as S-waves in seismology), longitudinal sound waves in the solid exist with a velocity and wave impedance dependent on the material&#x27;s density and its rigidity, the latter of which is described (as with sound in a gas) by the material&#x27;s bulk modulus.

In May 2022, NASA reported the sonification (converting astronomical data associated with pressure waves into sound) of the black hole at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster.

== Electromagnetics ==

Maxwell&#x27;s equations lead to the prediction of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, which are strictly transverse waves; due to the fact that they would need particles to vibrate upon, the electric and magnetic fields of which the wave consists are perpendicular to the direction of the wave&#x27;s propagation. However plasma waves are longitudinal since these are not electromagnetic waves but density waves of charged particles, but which can couple to the electromagnetic field.

After Heaviside&#x27;s attempts to generalize Maxwell&#x27;s equations, Heaviside concluded that electromagnetic waves were not to be found as longitudinal waves in &quot;&quot;free space&quot; or homogeneous media. Maxwell&#x27;s equations, as we now understand them, retain that conclusion: in free-space or other uniform isotropic dielectrics, electro-magnetic waves are strictly transverse. However electromagnetic waves can display a longitudinal component in the electric and/or magnetic fields when traversing birefringent materials, or inhomogeneous materials especially at interfaces (surface waves for instance) such as Zenneck waves.

In the development of modern physics, Alexandru Proca (1897–1955) was known for developing relativistic quantum field equations bearing his name (Proca&#x27;s equations) which apply to the massive vector spin-1 mesons. In recent decades some other theorists, such as Jean-Pierre Vigier and Bo Lehnert of the Swedish Royal Society, have used the Proca equation in an attempt to demonstrate photon mass as a longitudinal electromagnetic component of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, suggesting that longitudinal electromagnetic waves could exist in a Dirac polarized vacuum. However photon rest mass is strongly doubted by almost all physicists and is incompatible with the Standard Model of physics.

<text>Fifteen ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Enterprise (orHMS &quot;Enterprize) while another was planned:

* was a 24-gun sixth rate, previously the French frigate , captured in May 1705. She was wrecked in October 1707.
* was a 44-gun fifth rate launched in 1709. She underwent a great repair in 1718–19, was hulked in 1740 and fitted as a hospital ship in 1745 before being sold in 1749.
* , a 44-gun frigate, was to have been named &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but was renamed five months before her launch in 1741.
* was an 8-gun sloop captured from the Spanish in 1743. She was employed solely in the Mediterranean as a dispatch vessel and tender, and was sold in 1748 at Minorca.
* HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a 48-gun fifth rate launched in 1693 as . She was renamed &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 1744 as a 44-gun fifth rate and was broken up in 1771.
* was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate launched in August 1774, on harbour service from 1790 and broken up in 1807.
* was a 10-gun tender captured by the Americans in 1775, see USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (1775).
* HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a ship used for harbour service, launched in 1778 as . &quot;Resource&quot; was rebuilt as a 22-gun floating battery in 1804, renamed &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 1806 and sold in 1816.
* was a wooden paddle gunvessel purchased in 1824 and in service until 1830.
* was a survey sloop launched in 1848, used as an Arctic discovery ship in the search for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition, then used as a coal hulk from 1860 and sold in 1903.
* HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was to have been a wooden screw sloop. She was laid down in 1861, renamed HMS &quot;Circassian&quot; in 1862 but cancelled in 1863.
* was an ironclad sloop ordered as HMS &quot;Circassian&quot;, but renamed in 1862. She was launched in 1864 and sold in 1884.
* was an light cruiser launched in 1919 and sold in 1946.
* was an inshore survey ship launched in 1958 and sold in 1985.
* was an multi-role survey vessel (hydrographic/oceanographic) launched in 2002 and decommissioned in 2023.

Four other ships which served with the Royal Navy were also named Enterprise, but were not commissioned warships and so did not have the &quot;HMS&quot; prefix.
* &quot;Enterprise&quot; LP was a British East India Company armed paddle steamer that served alongside the Fleet in the First China War from 1839 to 1840 and the Second Burmese War in 1852.
* &quot;Enterprise&quot; was an uncommissioned tugboat that was in service at Portsmouth Dockyard from 1899 to 1919, when she was renamed &quot;Emprise&quot;. She continued to serve until 1947.
* &quot;Enterprise&quot; was an uncommissioned auxiliary patrol anti-submarine net drifter with Harwich local forces from 1914 to 1918.
* &quot;Enterprise II&quot; was an uncommissioned drifter, originally based at Larne but transferred to Italian waters in November 1915. In March 1916 she struck a naval mine off Brindisi and sank with eight casualties.

==Battle honours==
Ships named &quot;Enterprise&quot; have earned the following battle honours:
*Atlantic, 1939−40

<text>Sir Simon Denis Rattle (born 19 January 1955) is a British conductor with German citizenship. He rose to international prominence during the 1980s and 1990s, while music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (1980–1998). Rattle was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic from 2002 to 2018, and music director of the London Symphony Orchestra from 2017 to 2023. He has been chief conductor of Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra since September 2023. Among the world&#x27;s leading conductors, in a 2015 &quot;Bachtrack&quot; poll, he was ranked by music critics as one of the world&#x27;s best living conductors.

Rattle is also the patron of Birmingham Schools&#x27; Symphony Orchestra, arranged during his tenure with CBSO in the mid-1990s. The Youth Orchestra is now under the auspices of charitable business Services for Education. He received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2001 at the Classic Brit Awards.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simon Rattle was born in Liverpool, England, the son of Pauline Lila Violet (née Greening) and Denis Guttridge Rattle, a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II. He was educated at Liverpool College. Although Rattle studied piano and violin, his early work with orchestras was as a percussionist for the Merseyside Youth Orchestra (now the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Orchestra). He entered the Royal Academy of Music (now part of the University of London) in 1971. There, his teachers included John Carewe. In 1974, his graduation year, Rattle won the John Player International Conducting Competition.

After organising and conducting a performance of Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony while he was still at the academy, he was talent-spotted by the music agent Martin Campbell-White, of Harold Holt Ltd (now Askonas Holt Ltd), who has since managed Rattle&#x27;s career. He spent the academic year 1980–81 at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford studying English Language and Literature. He had been attracted to the college by the reputation of Dorothy Bednarowska, fellow and tutor in English. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of St Anne&#x27;s in 1991. He was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Music &quot;honoris causa&quot; of the University of Oxford in 1999.

===Early career===
In 1974, he was made assistant conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.

He joined the Glyndebourne Festival Opera music staff at the age of 20 in 1975. He went on to conduct over 200 performances of 13 different operas at Glyndebourne and on tour during the subsequent 28 years.

His first Prom at the Royal Albert Hall, conducting the London Sinfonietta, was, according to the BBC Proms Archive website, on 9 August 1976. The programme included Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s &quot;Meridian&quot; and Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s First Chamber Symphony. In 1977, he became assistant conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.

===City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra===
His time with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) from 1980 to 1998 drew him to the attention of critics and the public. In 1980, Rattle became the CBSO&#x27;s principal conductor and artistic adviser, and in 1990, music director. Rattle increased both his profile and that of the orchestra over his tenure. One of his long-term concert projects was the series of concerts of 20th-century music titled &quot;Towards the Millennium&quot;. One other major achievement during his time was the move of the CBSO from its former venue, Birmingham Town Hall, to a newly built concert hall, Symphony Hall, in 1991. The BBC commissioned film director Jaine Green to follow him in his final year with the CBSO to make &quot;Simon Rattle—Moving On&quot;.

Rattle was appointed a in 1987 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1994. In 1992, Rattle was named a principal guest conductor of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE), along with Frans Brüggen. Rattle now has the title of Principal Artist with the OAE. In 2001, he conducted the OAE at Glyndebourne in their first production of &quot;Fidelio&quot; with a period-instrument orchestra.

Rattle strongly supported youth music. He led two attempts at gaining the record for the World&#x27;s Largest Orchestra, both designed to raise awareness of youth music in schools. The first, in 1996, was unsuccessful. The second, in 1998, did succeed and the record held at nearly 4,000 musicians until it was broken in 2000 by a group in Vancouver.

In 2000, Rattle was presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. From 29 April to 17 May 2002, he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra, making live recordings of the complete Beethoven symphonies. In May 2006, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Arts. In 2011, the Royal Academy of Music presented him with an honorary doctorate. He was appointed member of the Order of Merit (OM) in the 2014 New Year Honours.

Rattle conducted the London Symphony Orchestra at the Opening of the London Olympics 2012, performing &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; with guest Rowan Atkinson playing his Mr. Bean character.

===Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra===
Rattle made his conducting debut with the Berlin Philharmonic (BPO) in 1987, in a performance of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 6. In 1999, Rattle was appointed as successor to Claudio Abbado as the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor. The appointment was decided on in a 23 June vote by the orchestra&#x27;s members. At the time the vote was considered somewhat controversial, as several members of the orchestra were earlier reported to have preferred Daniel Barenboim for the post. Nevertheless, Rattle won the post and proceeded to win over his detractors by refusing to sign the contract until he had ensured that every member of the orchestra was paid fairly, and also that the orchestra would gain artistic independence from the Berlin Senate.

Before leaving for Germany and on his arrival, Rattle controversially attacked the British attitude to culture in general, and in particular the artists of the Britart movement, together with the state funding of culture in the UK.

Since his appointment, Rattle has reorganised the Berlin Philharmonic into a foundation, meaning its activities are more under the control of the members rather than politicians. He has also ensured that orchestra members&#x27; wages have increased quite dramatically, after falling over the previous few years. He gave his first concert as principal conductor of the BPO on 7 September 2002, leading performances of Thomas Adès&#x27; &quot;Asyla&quot; and Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, performances which received rave reviews from the press worldwide and were recorded for CD and DVD release by EMI. Early collaborative projects in the Berlin community with Rattle and the BPO involved a choreographed performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; danced by school children, documented in &quot;Rhythm Is It!&quot;, and a film project with Mark-Anthony Turnage&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Floor&quot;. He has also continued to champion contemporary music in Berlin. The orchestra has established its first education department during Rattle&#x27;s tenure.

Criticism of Rattle&#x27;s tenure with the Berlin Philharmonic began to appear after their first season together, and continued in their second season. Rattle himself stated in 2005 that his relationship with the BPO musicians could sometimes be &quot;turbulent&quot;, but also &quot;never destructively so&quot;.

In 2006, a new controversy began in the German press as to the quality of Rattle&#x27;s concerts with the Berlin Philharmonic, with criticism from the German critic Manuel Brug in &quot;Die Welt&quot;. One musician who wrote to the press to defend Rattle was the pianist Alfred Brendel. In 2007, the BPO/Rattle recording of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; received the Classic FM Gramophone best choral disc award.

Rattle was originally contracted to lead the BPO until 2012, but in April 2008 the BPO musicians voted to extend his contract as chief conductor for an additional ten years past the next season, to 2018. In January 2013, he announced his scheduled departure from the Berlin Philharmonic at the close of the 2017–2018 season. His final Berlin Philharmonic concert as chief conductor was at the Waldbühne on 24 June 2018.

UNICEF appointed Rattle and the BPO as Goodwill Ambassadors in November 2007. He is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

===Conducting in North America===
Rattle made his North American debut in 1976, conducting the London Schools Symphony Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. He first conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1979 during the music directorship of Carlo Maria Giulini, and was their principal guest conductor from 1981 to 1994. He has also guest-conducted the Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Boston Symphony Orchestra. His New York City debut was with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1985. In 2000, Rattle was the music director of the Ojai Music Festival.

In 1993, Rattle made his conducting debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He returned for guest conducting engagements in 1999 and 2000. The musical relationship between Rattle and the Philadelphia Orchestra was reported to be such that Philadelphia wanted to hire Rattle as its next music director after Wolfgang Sawallisch, but Rattle declined. Rattle has continued to guest-conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra, including appearances in 2006 and the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s first performances of Robert Schumann&#x27;s cantata &quot;Das Paradies und die Peri&quot; in November 2007.

===London Symphony Orchestra===
In March 2015, the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) announced the appointment of Rattle as its next music director, effective with the 2017–2018 season, with an initial contract of five seasons. He has recorded commercially for the LSO Live label. In January 2021 the LSO announced an extension of his contract to 2023. Rattle stood down as music director of the LSO at the close of the 2022–2023 season, and now has the title of Conductor Emeritus with the LSO for life. His last LSO performance came on 27 August at the BBC Proms, conducting Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9.

===Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and subsequent career===
In 2010, Rattle first guest-conducted the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (BRSO). In January 2021, the BRSO announced the appointment of Rattle as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2023–2024 season, with an initial contract of five years. His inaugurual concert as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor took place on 21 September 2023, with a performance of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; at the &quot;Herkulessaal&quot;, Munich Residenz.

In 2019, Rattle first guest-conducted the Czech Philharmonic. In February 2024, the Czech Philharmonic announced the appointment of Rattle as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2024-2025 season, for a period of five years, with the title of &#x27;Rafael Kubelík Conducting Chair&#x27;.

==Musical styles and recordings==

Rattle has conducted a wide variety of music, including some with period instruments (either actual surviving historical musical instruments or modernly made ones informed by commonly used designs and material of the time), but he is best known for his interpretations of late 19th- and early 20th-century composers such as Gustav Mahler, with a recording of Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony winning several awards on its release. He has also championed much contemporary music, an example of this being the 1996 TV series &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, where he presents a 7-part survey of musical styles and conductors with excerpts recorded by the CBSO.

Other recordings in Berlin have included Dvořák tone poems, Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 and Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La Mer&quot;. The &quot;Gramophone Magazine&quot; praised the latter as a &quot;magnificent disc&quot; and drew favourable comparisons with interpretations of the piece by Rattle&#x27;s immediate predecessors, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan. He has also worked with the Toronto Children&#x27;s Chorus. Rattle and the BPO also recorded Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; (EMI), which was the &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; Orchestra Choice. In addition, Rattle&#x27;s acclaimed complete 1989 recording of George Gershwin&#x27;s opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was used as the soundtrack for the equally acclaimed 1993 television production of the work. It was the first made-for-television production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; ever presented. Rattle&#x27;s 2007 recording of Johannes Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; received praise from &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;, as &quot;Disc of the Month&quot; for April 2007, &quot;as probably the best new version of the &quot;Requiem&quot; I&#x27;ve heard in quite some years&quot;. Rattle and the BPO have also released recordings of Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Fourth Symphony (&quot;Romantic&quot;), and Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 and Sinfonia Concertante.

Rattle&#x27;s recording of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; with the BPO received the Choral Performance Grammy Award in 2008. He has won two other Grammy Awards, one Choral Performance Award for a recording of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; in 2007, and another for Best Orchestral Performance for a recording of Mahler&#x27;s unfinished Symphony No. 10 in 2000.

The French Government awarded him the honour of Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2010. Rattle was elected to the inaugural Gramophone Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Personal life==
Rattle&#x27;s first marriage was to Elise Ross, an American soprano, with whom he had two sons: Sacha, who is a clarinettist, and Eliot, who is a painter. They divorced in 1995 after 15 years of marriage. In 1996, he married his second wife, Candace Allen, a US-born writer. This second marriage ended in 2004, and in 2008 Rattle married the Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená. The couple live in Berlin and have two sons and a daughter.

Rattle is a member of the Incorporated Society of Musicians and a fan of Liverpool Football Club.

Rattle announced in January 2021 that he had applied for German citizenship, describing it as &quot;an absolute necessity&quot; for him in order to continue to work freely around the EU after Brexit.

<text>A universal joint (also called a universal coupling or U-joint) is a joint or coupling connecting rigid shafts whose are inclined to each other. It is commonly used in shafts that transmit rotary motion. It consists of a pair of hinges located close together, oriented at 90° to each other, connected by a cross shaft. The universal joint is not a constant-velocity joint.

U-joints are also sometimes called by various eponymous names, as follows: 
* Cardan joint, after Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath of the 16th century who contributed to knowledge of various clever mechanisms, including gimbals 
* Hooke joint or Hooke&#x27;s joint, after Robert Hooke, a polymath of the 17th century who contributed to knowledge of various clever mechanisms 
* Spicer joint, after Clarence W. Spicer and the Spicer Manufacturing Company, who manufactured U joints
* Hardy Spicer joint, after the Hardy Spicer brand, a successor to the Spicer brand 

== History ==

The main concept of the universal joint is based on the design of gimbals, which have been in use since antiquity. One anticipation of the universal joint was its use by the ancient Greeks on ballistae. In Europe the universal joint is often called the Cardano joint (and a drive shaft that uses the joints, a Cardan shaft), after the 16th century Italian mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, who was an early writer on gimbals, although his writings mentioned only gimbal mountings, not universal joints.

The mechanism was later described in &quot;Technica curiosa sive mirabilia artis&quot; (1664) by Gaspar Schott, who mistakenly claimed that it was a constant-velocity joint. Shortly afterward, between 1667 and 1675, Robert Hooke analysed the joint and found that its speed of rotation was nonuniform, but that property could be used to track the motion of the shadow on the face of a sundial. In fact, the component of the equation of time which accounts for the tilt of the equatorial plane relative to the ecliptic is entirely analogous to the mathematical description of the universal joint. The first recorded use of the term &#x27;universal joint&#x27; for this device was by Hooke in 1676, in his book &quot;Helioscopes&quot;. He published a description in 1678, resulting in the use of the term &quot;Hooke&#x27;s joint&quot; in the English-speaking world. In 1683, Hooke proposed a solution to the nonuniform rotary speed of the universal joint: a pair of Hooke&#x27;s joints 90° out of phase at either end of an intermediate shaft, an arrangement that is now known as a type of constant-velocity joint. Christopher Polhem of Sweden later re-invented the universal joint, giving rise to the name &quot;Polhemsknut&quot; (&quot;Polhem knot&quot;) in Swedish.

In 1841, the English scientist Robert Willis analyzed the motion of the universal joint. By 1845, the French engineer and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet had analyzed the movement of the universal joint using spherical trigonometry.

The term &quot;universal joint&quot; was used in the 18th century and was in common use in the 19th century. Edmund Morewood&#x27;s 1844 patent for a metal coating machine called for a universal joint, by that name, to accommodate small alignment errors between the engine and rolling mill shafts. Ephriam Shay&#x27;s locomotive patent of 1881, for example, used double universal joints in the locomotive&#x27;s drive shaft. Charles Amidon used a much smaller universal joint in his bit-brace patented 1884. Beauchamp Tower&#x27;s spherical, rotary, high speed steam engine used an adaptation of the universal joint .

The term &#x27;Cardan joint&#x27; appears to be a latecomer to the English language. Many early uses in the 19th century appear in translations from French or are strongly influenced by French usage. Examples include an 1868 report on the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; of 1867 and an article on the dynamometer translated from French in 1881.

In the 20th century, Clarence W. Spicer and the Spicer Manufacturing Company, as well as the Hardy Spicer successor brand, helped further popularize universal joints in the automotive, farm equipment, heavy equipment, and industrial machinery industries.

== Equation of motion ==


The Cardan joint suffers from one major problem: even when the input drive shaft axle rotates at a constant speed, the output drive shaft axle rotates at a variable speed, thus causing vibration and wear. The variation in the speed of the driven shaft depends on the configuration of the joint, which is specified by three variables:
# formula_1 the angle of rotation for axle 1
# formula_2 the angle of rotation for axle 2
# formula_3 the bend angle of the joint, or angle of the axles with respect to each other, with zero being parallel or straight through.

These variables are illustrated in the diagram on the right. Also shown are a set of fixed coordinate axes with unit vectors formula_4 and formula_5 and the planes of rotation of each axle. These planes of rotation are perpendicular to the axes of rotation and do not move as the axles rotate. The two axles are joined by a gimbal which is not shown. However, axle 1 attaches to the gimbal at the red points on the red plane of rotation in the diagram, and axle 2 attaches at the blue points on the blue plane. Coordinate systems fixed with respect to the rotating axles are defined as having their x-axis unit vectors (formula_6 and formula_7) pointing from the origin towards one of the connection points. As shown in the diagram, formula_6 is at angle formula_1 with respect to its beginning position along the &quot;x&quot; axis and formula_7 is at angle formula_2 with respect to its beginning position along the &quot;y&quot; axis.

formula_6 is confined to the &quot;red plane&quot; in the diagram and is related to formula_1 by:

formula_14

formula_7 is confined to the &quot;blue plane&quot; in the diagram and is the result of the unit vector on the &quot;x&quot; axis formula_16 being rotated through Euler angles formula_17:

formula_18

A constraint on the formula_6 and formula_7 vectors is that since they are fixed in the gimbal, they must remain at right angles to each other. This is so when their dot product equals zero:

formula_21

Thus the equation of motion relating the two angular positions is given by:

formula_22

with a formal solution for 

formula_23

The solution for formula_2 is not unique since the arctangent function is multivalued, however it is required that the solution for formula_2 be continuous over the angles of interest. For example, the following explicit solution using the atan2(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;x&quot;) function will be valid for formula_26:

formula_27

The angles formula_1 and formula_2 in a rotating joint will be functions of time. Differentiating the equation of motion with respect to time and using the equation of motion itself to eliminate a variable yields the relationship between the angular velocities formula_30 and 

formula_31

As shown in the plots, the angular velocities are not linearly related, but rather are periodic with a period half that of the rotating shafts. The angular velocity equation can again be differentiated to get the relation between the angular accelerations formula_32 and 

formula_33

==Double Cardan shaft==

A configuration known as a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second U-joint phased in relation to the first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase. This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is known as a drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.

Even when the driving and driven shafts are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft, if these angles are greater than zero, oscillating moments are applied to the three shafts as they rotate. These tend to bend them in a direction perpendicular to the common plane of the shafts. This applies forces to the support bearings and can cause &quot;launch shudder&quot; in rear wheel drive vehicles. The intermediate shaft will also have a sinusoidal component to its angular velocity, which contributes to vibration and stresses.

Mathematically, this can be shown as follows: If formula_34 and formula_35 are the angles for the input and output of the universal joint connecting the drive and the intermediate shafts respectively, and formula_36 and formula_37 are the angles for the input and output of the universal joint connecting the intermediate and the output shafts respectively, and each pair are at angle formula_38 with respect to each other, then:

formula_39

If the second universal joint is rotated 90 degrees with respect to the first, then Using the fact that formula_40 yields:

formula_41

and it is seen that the output drive is just 90 degrees out of phase with the input shaft, yielding a constant-velocity drive.

NOTE: The reference for measuring angles of input and output shafts of universal joint are mutually perpendicular axes. So, in absolute sense the forks of the intermediate shaft are parallel to each other. (Since, one fork is acting as input and the other fork is acting as output for shafts and above 90 degree phase difference is mentioned between the forks.)

==Double Cardan joint==
A double Cardan joint consists of two universal joints mounted back to back with a centre yoke; the centre yoke replaces the intermediate shaft. Provided that the angle between the input shaft and centre yoke is equal to the angle between the centre yoke and the output shaft, the second Cardan joint will cancel the velocity errors introduced by the first Cardan joint and the aligned double Cardan joint will act as a CV joint.

===Thompson coupling===
A Thompson coupling is a refined version of the double Cardan joint. It offers slightly increased efficiency with the penalty of great increase in complexity.

<doc id="144949" wikidata="Q223493" url="?curid=144949" title="Altair 8800">
<text>The Altair 8800 is a microcomputer designed in 1974 by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) and based on the Intel 8080 CPU. It was the first commercially successful personal computer. Interest in the Altair 8800 grew quickly after it was featured on the cover of the January 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and was sold by mail order through advertisements there, in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;, and in other hobbyist magazines. The Altair 8800 had no built-in screen or video output, so it would have to be connected to a serial terminal (such as a VT100-compatible terminal) to have any output. To connect it to a terminal a serial interface card had to be installed. Alternatively, the Altair could be programmed using its front-panel switches.

According to the personal computer pioneer Harry Garland, the Altair 8800 was the product that catalyzed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s. The computer bus designed for the Altair became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard in the form of the S-100 bus, and the first programming language for the machine was Microsoft&#x27;s founding product, Altair BASIC.

== History ==
While serving at the Air Force Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base, Ed Roberts and Forrest M. Mims III decided to use their electronics background to produce small kits for model rocket hobbyists. In 1969, Roberts and Mims, along with Stan Cagle and Robert Zaller, founded Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) in Roberts&#x27; garage in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and started selling radio transmitters and instruments for model rockets.

===Calculators===
The model rocket kits were a modest success and MITS wanted to try a kit that would appeal to more hobbyists. The November 1970 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; featured the Opticom, a kit from MITS that would send voice over an LED light beam. As Mims and Cagle were losing interest in the kit business, Roberts bought his partners out and began developing a calculator kit. Electronic Arrays had just announced the EAS100, a set of six large scale integrated (LSI) circuit chips that would make a four-function calculator. The MITS 816 calculator kit used the chipset and was featured on the November 1971 cover of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. This calculator kit sold for , or $275 assembled. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual for this kit and many others over the next several years. As payment for each manual he often accepted a copy of the kit.

The calculator was successful and was followed by several improved models. The MITS 1440 calculator was featured in the July 1973 issues of &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;. It had a 14-digit display, memory, and square root function. The kit sold for and the assembled version was . MITS later developed a programmer unit that would connect to the 816 or 1440 calculator and allow programs of up to 256 steps.

In 1972, Texas Instruments developed its own calculator chip and started selling complete calculators at less than half the price of other commercial models. MITS and many other companies were devastated by this, and Roberts struggled to reduce his quarter-million-dollar debt.

===Test equipment===
In addition to calculators, MITS made a line of test equipment kits. These included an IC tester, a waveform generator, a digital voltmeter, and several other instruments. To keep up with the demand, MITS moved into a larger building at 6328 Linn NE in Albuquerque in 1973. They installed a wave soldering machine and an assembly line at the new location.

===&quot;Popular Electronics&quot;===

In January 1972, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; merged with another Ziff-Davis magazine, &quot;Electronics World&quot;. The change in editorial staff upset many of their authors, and they started writing for a competing magazine, &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;. In 1972 and 1973, some of the best construction projects appeared in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;.

In 1974, Art Salsberg became editor of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. It was Salsberg&#x27;s goal to reclaim the lead in electronics projects. He was impressed with Don Lancaster&#x27;s TV Typewriter (&quot;Radio Electronics&quot;, September 1973) article and wanted computer projects for &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. Don Lancaster did an ASCII keyboard for &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in April 1974. They were evaluating a computer trainer project by Jerry Ogden when the Mark-8 8008-based computer by Jonathan Titus appeared on the July 1974 cover of &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;. The computer trainer was put on hold and the editors looked for a real computer system. (&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; gave Jerry Ogden a column, &quot;Computer Bits&quot;, starting in June 1975.)

One of the editors, Les Solomon, knew MITS was working on an Intel 8080 based computer project and thought Roberts could provide the project for the always popular January issue. In a last-ditch attempt to save MITS, Roberts decided to do something that was impossible at the time: create a personal computer kit for hobbyists. The TV Typewriter and the Mark-8 computer projects were just a detailed set of plans and a set of bare printed circuit boards. The hobbyist faced the daunting task of acquiring all of the integrated circuits and other components. The editors of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; wanted a complete kit in a professional-looking enclosure.

Ed Roberts and his head engineer, Bill Yates, finished the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived due to a strike by the shipping company. Solomon already had a number of pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine. The January 1975 issue was registered on November 29, 1974, and began appearing on newsstands on December 19, 1974—during the week before Christmas of 1974—at which point the kit was officially (if not yet practically) available for sale.

===The name===
The typical MITS product had a generic name like the &quot;Model 1440 Calculator&quot; or the &quot;Model 1600 Digital Voltmeter&quot;. Ed Roberts was busy finishing the design and left the naming of the computer to the editors of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;.

One explanation of the Altair name, which editor Les Solomon later told the audience at the first Altair Computer Convention (March 1976), is that the name was inspired by Les&#x27;s 12-year-old daughter, Lauren. &quot;She said why don&#x27;t you call it Altair – that&#x27;s where the Enterprise is going tonight.&quot; The &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode is probably &quot;Amok Time&quot;, as this is the only one from &quot;The Original Series&quot; which takes the Enterprise crew to Altair (Six).

Another explanation is that the Altair was originally going to be named the PE-8 (Popular Electronics 8-bit), but Les Solomon thought this name to be rather dull, so Les, Alexander Burawa (associate editor), and John McVeigh (technical editor) decided that: &quot;It&#x27;s a stellar event, so let&#x27;s name it after a star.&quot; McVeigh suggested &quot;Altair&quot;, the twelfth brightest star in the sky.

===Intel 8080===
Ed Roberts had designed and manufactured programmable calculators and was familiar with the microprocessors available in 1974. He thought the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 were not powerful enough (in fact several microcomputers based on Intel chips were already on the market: the Canadian company Microsystems International&#x27;s CPS-1 built-in 1972 used a MIL MF7114 chip modeled on the 4004, the Micral marketed in January 1973 by the French company R2E and the MCM/70 marketed in 1974 by the Canadian company Micro Computer Machines); the National Semiconductor IMP-8 and IMP-16 required external hardware; the Motorola 6800 was still in development. So he chose the 8-bit Intel 8080. At that time, Intel&#x27;s main business was selling memory chips by the thousands to computer companies. They had no experience in selling small quantities of microprocessors. When the 8080 was introduced in April 1974, Intel set the single unit price at ($ in ). &quot;That figure had a nice ring to it,&quot; recalled Intel&#x27;s Dave House in 1984. &quot;Besides, it was a computer, and they usually cost thousands of dollars, so we felt it was a reasonable price.&quot; Ed Roberts had experience in buying OEM quantities of calculator chips and he was able to negotiate a price ($ in ) for the 8080 microprocessor chips. Seizing the opportunity to be ahead of computers of the time, MITS began development of the Altair 8800 in the summer of 1974, about 2 months after the release of the Intel 8080.

Intel made the Intellec-8 Microprocessor Development System that typically sold for a very profitable . It was functionally similar to the Altair 8800 but it was a commercial grade system with a wide selection of peripherals and development software. Customers would ask Intel why their Intellec-8 was so expensive when that Altair was only . Some salesmen said that MITS was getting cosmetic rejects or otherwise inferior chips. In July 1975, Intel sent a letter to its sales force stating that the MITS Altair 8800 computer used standard Intel 8080 parts. The sales force should sell the Intellec system based on its merits and that no one should make derogatory comments about valued customers like MITS. The letter was reprinted in the August 1975 issue of MITS Computer Notes. The &quot;cosmetic defect&quot; rumor has appeared in many accounts over the years although both MITS and Intel issued written denials in 1975.

===The launch===

For a decade, colleges had required science and engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew about computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like &quot;Pong&quot; introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital voltmeters and frequency counters. The Altair had enough power to be actually useful, and was designed as an expandable system that opened it up to all sorts of applications.

Ed Roberts optimistically told his banker that he could sell 800 computers, while in reality they needed to sell 200 over the next year just to break even. When readers got the January issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, MITS was flooded with inquiries and orders. They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones. In February MITS received 1,000 orders for the Altair 8800. The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was months before they could meet that. Roberts focused on delivering the computer; all of the options would wait until they could keep pace with the orders. MITS claimed to have delivered 2,500 Altair 8800s by the end of May. The number was over 5,000 by August 1975. MITS had under 20 employees in January but had grown to 90 by October 1975.

The Altair 8800 computer was a break-even sale for MITS. They needed to sell additional memory boards, I/O boards and other options to make a profit. The system came with a &quot;1024 word&quot; (1024 byte) memory board populated with 256 bytes. The BASIC language was announced in July 1975 and required a serial interface board and at least one or two 4096 word memory boards, depending on the language variant.

MITS Price List, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, August 1975.

* 4K BASIC language (when purchased with Altair, 4096 words of memory and interface board): $60
* 8K BASIC language (when purchased with Altair, two 4096-word memory boards and interface board): $75

MITS had no competition in the US for the first half of 1975. Their 4K memory board used dynamic RAM and it had several design problems. The delay in shipping optional boards and the problems with the 4K memory board created an opportunity for outside suppliers. 

An enterprising Altair owner, Robert Marsh, designed a 4K static memory that was plug-in compatible with the Altair 8800 and sold for $255. His company was Processor Technology, one of the most successful Altair compatible board suppliers. Their advertisement in the July 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; promised interface and PROM boards in addition to the 4K memory board. They would later develop a popular video display board that would plug directly into the Altair.

A consulting company in San Leandro, California, IMS Associates, Inc., wanted to purchase several Altair computers, but the long delivery time convinced them that they should build their own computers. In the October 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, a small advertisement announced the IMSAI 8080 computer. The ad noted that all boards were &quot;plug compatible&quot; with the Altair 8800. The computer cost $439 as a kit. The first 50 IMSAI computers shipped in December 1975. The IMSAI 8080 computer improved on the original Altair design in several areas. It was easier to assemble: The Altair required 60 wire connections between the front panel and the motherboard (backplane). The IMSAI required only two soldered connections between the front panel and power supply. The MITS motherboard consisted of 4 slot segments that had to be connected together with 100 wires. The IMSAI motherboard implemented 22 slots on a single segment. The IMSAI replaced the Altair&#x27;s one-shot clock generator with the Intel 8224. The IMSAI also had a larger power supply to handle the increasing number of expansion boards used in typical systems. The IMSAI advantage was short lived because MITS had recognized these shortcomings and developed the Altair 8800B, which was introduced in June 1976.

In 1977, Pertec Computer Corporation purchased MITS and began to market the computer, without changes (except for branding), as the PCC 8800 in 1978.

==Description==


In the first design of the Altair, the parts needed to make a complete machine would not fit on a single motherboard, and the machine consisted of four boards stacked on top of each other with stand-offs. Another problem facing Roberts was that the parts needed to make a truly useful computer were not available, or would not be designed in time for the January launch date. So during the construction of the second model, he decided to build most of the machine on removable cards, reducing the motherboard to nothing more than an interconnect between the cards, a backplane. The basic machine consisted of five cards, including the CPU on one and memory on another. He then looked for a cheap source of connectors and came across a supply of 100-pin edge connectors. The S-100 bus was eventually acknowledged by the professional computer community and adopted as the IEEE-696 computer bus standard.

The Altair bus consists of the pins of the Intel 8080 run out onto the backplane. No particular level of thought went into the design, which led to disasters such as shorting from various power lines of differing voltages being located next to each other. Another oddity was that the system included two unidirectional 8-bit data buses, when the normal practice was for a single bidirectional bus (this oddity did, however, allow a later expansion of the S-100 standard to 16 bits bidirectional by using both 8-bit buses in parallel). A deal on power supplies led to the use of +8 V and ±18 V, which had to be locally regulated on the cards to TTL (+5 V) or RS-232 (±12 V) standard voltage levels.

The Altair shipped in a two-piece case. The backplane and power supply were mounted on a base plate, along with the front and rear of the box. The &quot;lid&quot; was shaped like a C, forming the top, left, and right sides of the box. The front panel, which was inspired by the Data General Nova minicomputer, included a large number of toggle switches to feed binary data directly into the memory of the machine, and a number of red LEDs to read those values back out.

Programming the Altair via the front panel could be a tedious and time-consuming process. Programming required the toggling of the switches to positions corresponding to the desired 8080 microprocessor instruction or opcode in binary, then used the &quot;DEPOSIT NEXT&quot; switch to load that instruction into the next address of the machine&#x27;s memory. This step was repeated until all the opcodes of a presumably complete and correct program were in place. The only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel. Nevertheless, many were sold in this form. Development was already underway on additional cards, including a paper tape reader for storage, additional RAM cards, and an RS-232 interface to connect to a proper teletype terminal.

==Software==

===Altair BASIC===
Ed Roberts received a letter from Traf-O-Data asking whether he would be interested in buying what would eventually be the BASIC programming language for the machine. He called the company and reached a private home, where no one had heard of anything like BASIC. In fact the letter had been sent by Bill Gates and Paul Allen from the Boston area, and they had no BASIC yet to offer. When they called Roberts to follow up on the letter he expressed his interest, and the two started work on their BASIC interpreter using a self-made simulator for the 8080 on a PDP-10 mainframe computer. They figured that they had 30 days before someone else beat them to the punch, and once they had a version working on the simulator, Allen flew to Albuquerque to deliver the program, Altair BASIC (aka MITS 4K BASIC), on a paper tape. The first time it was run, it displayed &quot;READY&quot;, then Allen typed &quot;PRINT 2+2&quot;, and it immediately printed the correct answer: &quot;4&quot;. The game &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; was entered in, and this worked as well. Gates soon joined Allen and formed Microsoft, then spelled &quot;Micro-Soft&quot;.

=== Altair DOS ===
Announced in late 1975, it started shipping in August 1977.

<text>Robert Baldwin (May 12, 1804 – December 9, 1858) was an Upper Canadian lawyer and politician who with his political partner Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine of Lower Canada, led the first responsible government ministry in the Province of Canada. &quot;Responsible Government&quot; marked the province&#x27;s democratic self-government, without a revolution, although not without violence. This achievement also included the introduction of municipal government, the introduction of a modern legal system, reforms to the jury system in Upper Canada, and the abolition of imprisonment for debt. Baldwin is also noted for feuding with the Orange Order and other fraternal societies. The Lafontaine-Baldwin government enacted the Rebellion Losses Bill to compensate Lower Canadians for damages suffered during the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–1838. The passage of the Bill outraged Anglo-Canadian Tories in Montreal, resulting in the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal in 1849.

==Family==
Robert Baldwin&#x27;s grandfather, also Robert Baldwin (&quot;Robert the Emigrant&quot;) moved to Upper Canada from Ireland in 1799. His father was William Warren Baldwin (April 25, 1775 – January 8, 1844).

The Baldwin family was a prominent one. Robert Baldwin counted among his cousins such influential Upper Canadians as the Anglican bishop Maurice Scollard Baldwin, Toronto mayor Robert Baldwin Sullivan and the Irish-Catholic leader Connell James Baldwin. The Russell-Willcocks-Baldwin family formed an elite &quot;compact&quot; much like the infamous &quot;Family Compact&quot; led by Sir John Robinson against whom they fought.

In 1827, Baldwin, married his cousin Augusta Elizabeth Sullivan, daughter of Daniel Sullivan. The couple had four children, two sons and two daughters. The marriage ended with Augusta Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1836. Robert Baldwin died twenty-two years later, in 1858.

Robert Baldwin was the grandfather of Frederick Walker Baldwin, a Canadian aviation pioneer and partner of the famous inventor Alexander Graham Bell. Robert Baldwin was also the grandfather of Robert Baldwin Ross, a French-born journalist, art critic, and literary executor of Oscar Wilde.

== Political principles ==
=== First Principles ===
Baldwin&#x27;s political principles must be viewed in the context of the eighteenth-century British “Country Party,” a loose coalition of Parliamentarians whose influence was also felt in the American Revolution and subsequent Jacksonian politics. The Country party embodied a civic humanism that drew on ancient Greek and Roman conceptions of citizenship, and the value of selfless political participation for the public good; those selfish few who placed their private interests before the public good threatened the moral commitment of all citizens to political participation. The civic humanism of the Country party rejected the commercial ideology of the royal &quot;Court” party. The Country party had a republican emphasis that sought to preserve the power of a democratic parliament from the encroachments of the crown during the vast expansion of state administration, public credit, and the financial and commercial revolutions in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth centuries. It was similar to American conceptions of “civic republicanism” as they developed after the revolution among Jacksonian Democrats, as well as in the Chartist movement in Britain in the late 1830s.

=== Responsible Government ===
The concept of &quot;responsible government&quot; has been attributed to Dr. William W. Baldwin and his son, Robert. Although the idea of colonial ministerial responsibility to a colonial parliament had been touted since the late 18th century, the Baldwins were among the first to successfully implement the principle. The meaning of the phrase evolved. In an 1828 Upper Canadian petition to the British Parliament on colonial ills, it was an assertion that the Constitutional Act was a treaty between the British Parliament and the colonial peoples, and could not be arbitrarily altered by one or the other party. In 1836, when Baldwin convinced the members of the Executive Council to resign over Lt. Governor Bond-Head&#x27;s refusal to consult them on administrative appointments, it did not mean ministerial accountability to the elected Assembly (Executive Councillors were not ministers) but the Crown&#x27;s obligation to consult that Council. The slipperiness of the phrase points to its real goal, &#x27;sovereignty by stealth,&#x27; without rebellion. It was not until after the Rebellions of 1837, and the implementation of Lord Durham&#x27;s Report, that the Executive Council became a cabinet of ministers that were heads of departments, and the phrase &quot;responsible government&quot; came to mean their responsibility to the elected Assembly, not the appointed Governor.

=== Municipal government ===

Municipal government in Upper Canada was under the control of appointed magistrates who sat in Courts of Quarter Sessions to administer the law within a District. A few cities, such as Toronto, were incorporated by special acts of the legislature. After the Union of the Canadas, the new governor, Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham, spearheaded the passage of the District Councils Act which transferred the municipal government to District Councils. His bill allowed for two elected councilors from each township, but the warden, clerk, and treasurer were to be appointed by the government. This thus allowed for strong administrative control and continued government patronage appointments. Sydenham&#x27;s bill reflected his larger concerns to limit popular participation under the tutelage of a strong executive. Baldwin was one of the few Reformers who opposed the District Council Act; he considered its reform by the Baldwin Act in 1849 one of his greatest accomplishments. The Baldwin Act made the municipal government truly democratic rather than an extension of central control of the Crown. It delegated authority to the municipal governments so they could raise taxes and enact by-laws. It also established a hierarchy of types of municipal governments, starting at the top with cities and continued down past towns, villages and finally townships. This system was to prevail for the next 150 years.

== Political career ==

Robert Baldwin was not a natural politician. He was described as melancholy, and awkward in public. He gave speeches in a whispering, halting style. Although elected in 1830 as a member of the Legislative Assembly for the town of York in a by-election, he was defeated in the general election later that year. Despite this inauspicious start, his adherence to principle and his fearlessness in the face of Orange Order electoral violence won him the loyalty of voters in the post-Rebellion period.

=== To the Rebellion of 1837 ===

After losing his seat in the 1830 election, Baldwin withdrew to his private legal practice until his wife&#x27;s death as a result of a Caesarian in 1836. He took no part in the Political Union movement of the 1830s. Two weeks after Eliza Baldwin&#x27;s death, Sir Francis Bond Head (1793–1875) arrived as the new Lieutenant Governor, to address reform grievances. He sought out and appointed reformers Baldwin, John Dunn and John Rolph to the Executive Council with three Compact members. Baldwin&#x27;s condition for joining the Executive Council was a verbal commitment by Bond Head to a responsible government. Bond Head later refused to give written confirmation of the agreement, so Baldwin resigned within a month and convinced the other councilors, both Reform and Tory, to resign with him. This convinced Bond Head that the Reformers were intractable. He called an immediate election, in which he as Lt. Governor waded into the electoral fray, and with the use of Orange Order polling violence, expunged the reformers from the Legislative Assembly.

Baldwin traveled to Great Britain in 1836 to see the colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg but was refused. He wrote to Glenelg that &quot;if the Mother Country desires to retain the colony ... it can only be done either by force or with the consent of the people. I take it for granted that Great Britain cannot desire to exercise a Government of the Sword.&quot; He laid out the remedy – responsible government – but was spurned, and the colony descended into rebellion.

Though a moderate reformer, Robert Baldwin strongly disapproved of the rebellion of 1837–38, and as a function of his views provided allegedly a lackluster defense of Peter Matthews (rebel), who was executed for his role in the Rebellion. Baldwin served as an intermediary, with John Rolph, between the rebels and the Lt. Governor, carrying a flag of truce to the rebel camp north of Toronto on 5 December 1837, but failed to head off an armed clash. He and his father William advised Lord Durham to suggest responsible government to the British government.

=== The Union of the Canadas ===

In response to Durham&#x27;s Report, the British Government appointed Charles Poulett Thomson (later Lord Sydenham) as Governor with two main tasks. Firstly, he was to weaken the Canadien vote in Lower Canada through the union of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada and a strengthened Executive Council. And secondly, he was to strengthen British rule by imposing a new system of centrally controlled District Councils that would take much of the elected Assembly&#x27;s legislative purview, leaving it little to do but approve the Governor&#x27;s budgets. Both reforms would strengthen the central state and weaken (Canadien) legislative power.

Sydenham reformed the Executive Council, making government ministers members for the first time (i.e. Cabinet Rule). He attempted to solicit Reform support by appointing Baldwin as Solicitor General in 1840. To follow his principle of responsible government, Baldwin needed to seek election so that he, a government minister, could be accountable to the elected Assembly, not the Crown.

Orange Order riots during the Toronto civic elections in January 1841 convinced Baldwin he could never win a seat in the city. Instead, he sought election in the ridings of Hastings and 4th York. The Children of Peace, who had played a large role in the pre-Rebellion Reform Movement, managed Baldwin&#x27;s election in 4th York and he &#x27;walked over the course without a contest,&#x27; thus becoming the first member to be elected to the United Parliament. He was also later returned to Hastings.

=== Baldwin &amp; LaFontaine ===
Although Baldwin was elected in two seats in Canada West, reformers were in the minority. In Canada East, gerrymandering and Orange Order violence were used to prevent the election of Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine, leader of the Canadien reformers in Terrebonne, outside Montreal. To ensure LaFontaine a seat, Baldwin proposed to David Willson, leader of the Children of Peace, that they nominate LaFontaine for the seat in 4th York. Baldwin also insisted that Sydenham include LaFontaine in the reformed Executive Council, or he would resign as Solicitor General. Their alliance allowed Lafontaine to have a seat in the assembly in 1841 and for Baldwin to win the by-election in 1843.

On 3 September 1841, the Children of Peace held a campaign rally for Baldwin and LaFontaine in their Temple, where they rejoiced &quot;to say that we have it in our power to show our impartial respect to the Canadian people of the Lower Province.&quot; Despite threats of Orange Order violence, LaFontaine was elected as representative of 4th York.

However, before LaFontaine could take up his seat, Governor Sydenham died. His replacement, Sir Charles Bagot, was not able to form a mixed cabinet of Reformers and Tories, and so he was forced to include the &quot;Canadien party&quot; under LaFontaine. LaFontaine refused to join the Executive Council unless Baldwin was also included. Bagot was finally forced to accede in September 1842, and when he became severely ill thereafter, Baldwin and Lafontaine became the first real premiers of the Province of Canada. However, to take office as ministers, the two had to run for re-election. While LaFontaine was easily re-elected in 4th York, Baldwin lost his seat in Hastings as a result of Orange Order violence. It was now that the pact between the two men was completely solidified, as LaFontaine arranged for Baldwin to run in Rimouski, a constituency in a heavily francophone area of Canada East. This was the union of the Canadas they sought, where LaFontaine overcame linguistic prejudice to gain a seat in English Canada, and Baldwin obtained his seat in French Canada.

=== Metcalfe and the Reform Association of Canada ===
The Baldwin-LaFontaine ministry barely lasted six months before Governor Bagot also died in March 1843. He was replaced with Sir Charles Metcalfe, whose instructions were to check the &quot;radical&quot; reform government. The relationship between Baldwin and Metcalfe soured over Baldwin&#x27;s Secret Societies Bill, which sought to outlaw the Orange Order and its political violence. Metcalfe rejected the legislation and then began appointing his supporters to patronage positions without Baldwin and LaFontaine&#x27;s approval. They resigned in November 1843, beginning a constitutional crisis that lasted for a year. This year-long crisis, in which the legislature was prorogued, “was the final signpost on Upper Canada&#x27;s conceptual road to democracy. Lacking the scale of the American Revolution, it nonetheless forced a comparable articulation and rethinking of the basics of political dialogue in the province.”

During the year-long crisis, Metcalfe was to champion the Sydenham system and its conceptions of a limited, liberal capitalist government accountable to the imperial state, not the local Assembly; he continued to govern, demonstrating the irrelevance of Parliament. Baldwin now established a “Reform Association” in February 1844, to unite the Reform movement in Canada West to explain their understanding of responsible government before the expected election. Twenty-two branches were established. A grand meeting of all branches of the Reform Association was held in the Second Meeting House of the Children of Peace in Sharon. It was ultimately to serve as the springboard for Baldwin&#x27;s successful candidacy in 4th York. Baldwin had been at a loss about where to run after his loss in Hastings. Orange mobs continued to rule out any chance in Hastings, or in 2nd York, where he had lost to Orange leader George Duggan. LaFontaine, in yet another act of friendship, gave up his seat representing 4th York, thus allowing the desperate Baldwin to run there. David Willson, having arranged for the Reform Association rally during the illumination ceremony, now became Baldwin&#x27;s campaign manager. It was reported that over three thousand people attended this June rally for Baldwin.

=== Responsible Government achieved ===
At the general election which followed, the Governor-General was sustained by a narrow majority. The year-long political crisis had, however, made it clear that responsible government was inevitable; even the old Compact Tories, now reshaped into an incipient conservative party, demanded some form of responsible government. Metcalfe continued to govern until struck down by illness in 1846. The new Governor-General, Lord Elgin, was sent out specifically to acknowledge responsible government in the Canadas. In 1848 the Reformers were again returned to power, and Baldwin and Lafontaine formed their second administration on March 11 and carried numerous important reforms, including the Amnesty Act which offered pardons to all those involved in the Rebellions of 1837–8, the creation of a secular University of Toronto, and the introduction of municipal government. Their bravest achievement was to shepherd the Rebellion Losses Bill through Parliament in 1849. It sparked Orange riots, and the burning of the Parliament buildings as much of Europe was similarly engulfed in a wave of republican revolutions and counter-revolutions.

=== Reform transformed ===

The Baldwinite reformers were not a political party. With their primary aim achieved, the center could no longer hold. Internal dissensions soon began to appear, and in 1851 Baldwin resigned. The special struggle leading to his resignation was an attempt to abolish the Court of Chancery of Upper Canada, whose constitution was due to a measure introduced by Baldwin in 1849. The attempt, though defeated, had been supported by a majority of the representatives from Upper Canada, and Baldwin&#x27;s fastidious conscience took it as a vote of confidence. A deeper reason was his inability to approve of the advanced views of the Radicals, or &quot;Clear Grits,&quot; as they came to be called. On seeking re-election in York, he declined to give any pledge on the burning question of the Clergy Reserves and was defeated. In 1853 the Liberal-Conservative party, formed in 1854 by a coalition, attempted to bring him out as a candidate for the upper house, which was at this date elective. Though he had broken with the advanced reformers, Baldwin could not approve of the tactics of their opponents and refused to stand.

He died on 9 December 1858 in Spadina aged 54. Even those who most strongly opposed his measures admitted the purity and unselfishness of his motives. After the concession of responsible government, he devoted himself to bringing about a good understanding between the English and French-speaking inhabitants of Canada, and his memory is held as dear among the French Canadians as in his native province of Ontario.

== Legacy ==
John Ralston Saul pointed out in the inaugural LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium, that “we have killed in political strife among ourselves less than a hundred citizens – most of them on a single day at Batoche,” Saskatchewan, during the Riel Rebellion. “The first measure of any citizen-based culture” he adds, “must not be its rhetoric or myths or leaders or laws but how few of its citizens it kills.” This non-violent tradition we owe to Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine, who refused to abandon principle, and who walked away from retribution.

Baldwin Steps, a series of stairs from his father&#x27;s Spadina House at Austin Terrace to Davenport Road, is named after Baldwin.

<doc id="144952" wikidata="Q1234985" url="?curid=144952" title="John Bale">
<text>John Bale (21 November 1495 – November 1563) was an English churchman, historian controversialist, and Bishop of Ossory in Ireland. He wrote the oldest known historical verse drama in English (on the subject of King John), and developed and published a very extensive list of the works of British authors down to his own time, just as the monastic libraries were being dispersed. His contention that Joseph of Arimathea had brought a proto-Protestant faith to Britain that was purer than Catholicism was to have far-reaching ramifications; but his unhappy disposition and habit of quarrelling earned him the nickname &quot;bilious Bale&quot;.

== Outline of his life ==
He was born at Covehithe, near Dunwich in Suffolk. At the age of twelve he joined the Carmelite friars at Norwich, removing later to the house of &quot;Holme&quot;, (possibly the Carmelite Hulne Priory near Alnwick in Northumberland). Later he entered Jesus College, Cambridge, and took his degree of B.D. in 1529.

He became the last Prior of the Ipswich Carmelite house, elected in 1533. He abandoned his monastic vocation, and got married, saying, &quot;that I might never more serve so execrable a beast, I took to wife the faithful Dorothy&quot;. He obtained the living of Thorndon, Suffolk, but in 1534 was summoned before the Archbishop of York for a sermon against the invocation of saints preached at Doncaster, and afterwards before John Stokesley, Bishop of London, but he escaped through the powerful protection of Thomas Cromwell, whose notice he is said to have attracted by his miracle plays.

In these plays, Bale denounced the monastic system and its supporters in unrestrained language and coarse imagery. The prayer of &quot;Infidelitas&quot; which opens the second act of his &quot;Three Laws&quot; is an example of his profane parody. These somewhat brutal productions were intended to impress popular feeling, and Cromwell found in him an invaluable instrument. When Cromwell fell from favour in 1540, Bale fled with his wife and children to Antwerp. He returned on the accession of King Edward VI, and received the living of Bishopstoke, Hampshire, being promoted in 1552 to the Irish see of Ossory. He refused to be consecrated by the Roman Catholic rites of the Irish church, and won his point, though the Dean of Dublin made a protest against the revised office during the ceremony. He also quarrelled bitterly with the aged and respected judge Thomas St. Lawrence, who travelled to Kilkenny to urge the people to reject his innovations.

When the accession of Queen Mary inaugurated a violent reaction in matters of religion, he was forced to get out of the country again. He tried to escape to Scotland, but on the voyage was captured by a Dutch man-of-war, which was driven by bad weather into St Ives, Cornwall. Bale was arrested on suspicion of treason, but soon released. At Dover he had another narrow escape, but he eventually made his way to the Netherlands and thence to Frankfurt and Basel. Bale&#x27;s intent in his autobiographical &quot;Vocacyon&quot; was to write a polemical account of his escape from Ireland in parallel with the life of St Paul. Although &quot;Vocacyon&quot; is a broadly true account, Bale possessed a &quot;self-dramatizing tendency&quot;.

During his exile, he devoted himself to writing. After his return, on the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, he received (1560) a prebendal stall at Canterbury, where he died and was buried in the cathedral.

== Mysteries, Miracle Plays, &quot;Kynge Johan&quot; ==
John Bale attacked his enemies with vehemence and scurrility, much of which was directed strongly and forcibly against the Roman Catholic Church and its writers: but this cavil does not significantly diminish the value of his contributions to literature. (The Roman Catholic sympathiser and antiquary Anthony Wood, a man of &quot;uncouth manners&quot; and a condemned libeller, described him as &quot;foul-mouthed Bale&quot; a century afterwards.) Of his mysteries and miracle plays only five have been preserved, but the titles of the others, quoted by himself in his &quot;Catalogus&quot;, show that they were animated by the same political and religious aims. The &quot;Three Laws of Nature, Moses and Christ, corrupted by the Sodomytes, Pharisees and Papystes most wicked&quot; (produced in 1538 and again in 1562) was a morality play. The direction for the dressing of the parts is instructive: &quot;Let Idolatry be decked like an old witch, Sodomy like a monk of all sects, Ambition like a bishop, Covetousness like a Pharisee or spiritual lawyer, False Doctrine like a popish doctor, and Hypocrisy like a gray friar.&quot; , &quot;The Temptacyon of our Lorde&quot;, and were all written in 1538.

===&quot;Kynge Johan&quot;===

Bale is a figure of some literary-dramatic importance as the author of &quot;Kynge Johan&quot; (), which marks the transition between the old morality play and the English historical drama. It does not appear to have directly influenced the creators of the chronicle histories (such as &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (1591)), but it is remarkable that such a developed attempt at historical drama should have been made twenty-three years before the production of &quot;Gorboduc&quot; in 1561. &quot;Kynge Johan&quot; is itself a polemic against the Roman Catholic Church. King John is represented as the champion of English church rites against the Holy See.

== Summary of the Famous Writers of Great Britain ==
Bale&#x27;s most important work is &quot;Illustrium Maioris Britanniae scriptorum, hoc est, Angliae, Cambriae ac Scotiae summarium&quot; (&quot;Summary of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, that is, of England, Wales and Scotland&quot;), published at Ipswich by John Overton in 1548, and at Wesel by Derick van der Straten in 1549. This first edition contains authors through five centuries. Another edition, almost entirely rewritten and containing fourteen centuries, was printed at Basel by Johannes Oporinus with the title &quot;Scriptorum illustrium Maioris Brytanniae, quam nunc Angliam &amp; Scotiam vocant, catalogus&quot; (&quot;Catalogue of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, which now they call England and Scotland&quot;) in 1557, completed by a latter part in 1559.

This chronological catalogue of British authors and their works was partly founded on the &quot;De uiris illustribus&quot; of John Leland. Bale was an indefatigable collector and worker, and personally examined many of the valuable libraries of the Augustinian and Carmelite houses before their dissolution. His work contains much information that would otherwise have been hopelessly lost. His autograph note-book is preserved in the Selden Collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It contains the materials collected for his two published catalogues arranged alphabetically, without enlargement on them nor the personal remarks which colour the completed work. He includes the sources for his information. He noted: &quot;I have bene also at Norwyche, our second citye of name, and there all the library monuments are turned to the use of their grossers, candelmakers, sopesellers, and other worldly occupyers... As much have I saved there and in certen other places in Northfolke and Southfolke concerning the authors names and titles of their workes, as I could, and as much wold I have done throughout the whole realm, yf I had been able to have borne the charges, as I am not.&quot;

== Other writings and catalogues ==
John Bale&#x27;s written works are listed in &quot;Athenae Cantabrigienses.&quot; While in Germany he published an attack on the monastic system entitled &quot;The Actes of Englysh Votaries&quot;, three &quot;Lives&quot; as &quot;The Examinations of Lord Cobham, William Thorpe and Anne Askewe, &amp;c&quot;, and the &quot;Pageant of Popes&quot;. &quot;The Actes of Englysh Votaries&quot; is chiefly significant for its appropriation of the legend of Joseph of Arimathea for the Protestant cause. Joseph&#x27;s alleged early arrival in Britain had already been gleefully exploited by theologians and diplomats to enhance English claims to precedence. Bale&#x27;s innovation was to contend that the faith which Joseph brought, was also purer than that of Rome: &quot;the Brytaynes toke the christen faythe at the verye sprynge or fyrst goynge forth of the Gospell, whan the churche was most perfyght, and had most strengthe of the holye ghost&quot;. It was a claim that was enthusiastically taken up by English Protestants, including Queen Elizabeth. While Rector of Bishopstoke he produced &quot;The Image of Both Churches&quot;, and after his stormy association with Ossory he printed an account of his &quot;Vocacyon&quot; to that see. &quot;The Resurreccion of the Masse&quot;, purporting to be written by one Hugh Hilarie, is generally attributed to Bale.

John Pitts or Pitseus (1560–1616), an English Roman Catholic exile, founded on Bale&#x27;s work his &quot;Relationum historicarum de rebus anglicis tomus primus&quot; (Paris, 1619), better known by its running title of &quot;De Illustribus Angliae scriptoribus&quot;. This is really the fourth book of a more extensive work. He omits the Wycliffite and Protestant divines mentioned by Bale, and the most valuable section is the &quot;lives&quot; of the Roman Catholic exiles resident in Douai and other French towns. He asserts (&quot;Nota de Joanne Bale&quot;) that Bale&#x27;s &quot;Catalogus&quot; was a misrepresentation of John Leland&#x27;s work, though in all likelihood he only knew Leland&#x27;s work through his reading of Bale.

===&quot;The Image of Both Churches&quot;===

The Image of Both Churches was published by John Bale in 1545, and is a detailed commentary on the Book of Revelation, the last book in the Christian Bible. Bale proceeded by taking short passages and following with a detailed paraphrase to explain the meaning and significance of such things as the opening of the seven seals, the first beast, the second beast with two horns, the blowing of the trumpets, and the going forth of the horsemen. Of central concern was the correct identification of the Antichrist.

Bale&#x27;s central thesis is that the Book of Revelation is a prophecy of how God&#x27;s word and those who love it (the &quot;saints&quot;) would fare at the hands of men and a false Church during the last age, meaning the time between the ascension of Jesus and the end of the world.

Bale identified two types of churches. First, there was a false church, or Church of Antichrist, which persecutes those who do not bow to its dictates. He did not entirely limit his criticism to the Roman Church but, typical of the Puritans, accused also the young Church of England. By contrast, the &quot;true Church&quot; loves and teaches God&#x27;s word truly. He also speaks critically of the Church of Mohammed (&quot;Mahomet&quot;): its tyranny over the people (the &quot;Turks&quot;) and persecution of the saints.

==In popular culture==
He is the central figure in the 1988 novel &quot;Books of Bale&quot; by the novelist and playwright John Arden. He also appears in C. J. Sansom&#x27;s quasi-historical novel, &quot;Lamentation&quot; set in the last part of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign.

<text>Song Jiaoren (, ; Given name at birth: Liàn 鍊; Courtesy name: Dùnchū 鈍初; 5 April 1882 – 22 March 1913) was a Chinese republican revolutionary, political leader and a founder of the Kuomintang (KMT). Song Jiaoren led the KMT to electoral victories in China&#x27;s first democratic election. He based his appeal on the upper class gentry, landowners, and merchants. Historians have concluded that provisional president, Yuan Shikai, was responsible for his assassination on 22 March 1913.

== Early life ==
Song Jiaoren was born and educated in Hunan. When he was six years old, Song Jiaoren began his education at a private school. When Song was seventeen years old, he graduated and began enrollment at Taoyuan Zhangjiang College. The influence of his teachers, Huang Shouyi and Qu Fangmei, caused Song to make no effort to pursue the civil service examinations, and he was interested mainly in his time&#x27;s world events and the counterculture. Song received excellent grades in college.

In August 1902, Song Jiaoren went to Wuchang to attend the Bishop Boone Memorial School (now the Central China Normal University), and in Wuchang, he met the revolutionary Huang Xing, and the two quickly became lifelong friends. Huang was soon forced to leave Wuchang due to his revolutionary activities, and returned to his hometown of Changsha. After Huang left, Song continued his organization of revolutionary groups in Hunan, especially in Changsha and Changde.

Later in 1902, Song was recruited to teach at the Wuchang Normal School, a prestigious private secondary school. Song arrived in Wuchang and began teaching in 1903. In Wuhan, Song became involved with various local revolutionary groups, including the Huaxinghui, a group of which he became vice president. However, the Wuchang Garden Hill Party especially appealed to him. Song often discussed politics and revolution with his students, many of whom were opposed to the idea of revolution.

== Early involvement in Kuomintang ==
Because of his revolutionary activities, Song in 1904 was forced to flee China for Japan, where he studied western political thought and made contacts among the expatriate Chinese student population and Japanese Pan-Asianists. During this period, Song was a close friend of the Japanese nationalist thinker Kita Ikki.

In 1905, together with Sun Yat-sen, Song helped to found and was a leading activist in the &quot;Tongmenghui&quot;, which was an organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the formation of a republic. Song returned to China in 1910 after the Xinhai Revolution and traveled to Hong Kong the next year to organize the Second Guangzhou Uprising. After the 1912 declaration of the Republic of China, Song helped to transform the &quot;Tongmenghui&quot; into the Kuomintang, also known as the KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party.

Song spoke out against the increasing authoritarianism of China&#x27;s provisional president, Yuan Shikai, and expressed concerns towards Yuan&#x27;s indications that he would like to restore a monarchical system to China with himself as emperor. On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established in Nanjing. Song was appointed to reform China&#x27;s legal system, and he drafted a provisional constitution, the Republic of China Interim Government Organization Act.

== First Chinese election campaign ==
Song Jiaoren was only 30 when he was tasked by Sun Yat-sen to organize the Kuomintang for the 1912 Chinese democratic election campaign, the first in China. Song proved to be a naturally-skilled political organizer, but he had an arrogant self-confidence, which alienated many potential supporters. Only 10 percent of the adult males were allowed to vote, about 40 million in all, who were the gentry, landowners and middle-class merchants. They formed the political base of the new party. After the election, the Kuomintang won 269 of 596 seats in the House of Representatives and 123 of 274 seats in the Senate. Of the remaining seats, the majority were split between three rival parties, but over 300 small parties competed in the election. After the election, Song was widely regarded as a prime candidate for the position of prime minister.

One of Song&#x27;s main political goals was to ensure that the powers and the independence of China&#x27;s elected assemblies were properly protected from the influence of the office of the president. Song&#x27;s goals in curtailing the office of the president conflicted with the interests of China&#x27;s provisional president, Yuan Shikai. By mid-1912, clearly Yuan dominated over the provisional cabinet that he had named and was showing signs of a desire to hold overweening executive power. During Song&#x27;s travels through China in 1912, he had openly and vehemently expressed the desire to limit the powers of the president in terms that often appeared openly critical of Yuan&#x27;s ambitions. When the results of the 1913 elections indicated a clear victory for the Kuomintang, Song appeared to be in a position to exercise a dominant role in selecting the prime minister and cabinet, and the party could have proceeded to push for the election of a future president in a proper parliamentary setting.

== Assassination ==
On 20 March 1913, while traveling with a group of colleagues to the Parliament in Beijing, Song Jiaoren was shot twice at close range at the Shanghai Railway Station by a lone gunman, Wu Shiying, who had been contracted by Ying Guixin, a Shanghai underworld figure closely associated with the Yuan Shikai regime. Song died two days later in hospital. The trail of evidence led to the secretary of the cabinet and the provisional premier of Yuan Shikai&#x27;s government, Zhao Bingjun. Although Yuan was considered by contemporary Chinese media sources the man most likely behind the assassination, the main conspirators investigated by authorities were themselves assassinated or disappeared mysteriously. Because of the lack of evidence, Yuan was never officially implicated. After an investigation revealed telegraphs implicating Ying Guixin in Song&#x27;s assassination, Ying attempted to flee north, where Yuan could protect him, but was killed by two swordsmen while riding in a first-class train carriage. Zhao Bingjun was poisoned in 1914.

==Legacy==
The political climate in China degenerated soon after Song Jiaoren&#x27;s assassination, eventually leading to the failed Second Revolution. Yuan Shikai ejected the Kuomintang from China&#x27;s elected assemblies in 1913, dissolved parliament in 1914, declared himself emperor in 1915, and died in 1916. After the failure of China&#x27;s first democratic system to achieve a stable government, the country descended into more than a decade of warlordism.

<text>The national flag of Japan is a rectangular white banner with a crimson-red circle at its center. The flag is officially called the but is more commonly known in Japan as the . It embodies the country&#x27;s sobriquet: the Land of the Rising Sun.

The flag is designated as the national flag in the Act on National Flag and Anthem, which was promulgated and became effective on 13 August 1999. Although no earlier legislation had specified a national flag, the sun-disc flag had already become the &quot;de facto&quot; national flag of Japan. Two proclamations issued in 1870 by the Daijō-kan, the governmental body of the early Meiji period, each had a provision for a design of the national flag. A sun-disc flag was adopted as the national flag for merchant ships under Proclamation No. 57 of Meiji 3 (issued on 27 January 1870), and as the national flag used by the Navy under Proclamation No. 651 of Meiji 3 (issued on 3 October 1870). Use of the was severely restricted during the early years of the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II; these restrictions were later relaxed.

The sun plays an important role in Japanese mythology and religion, as the Emperor is said to be the direct descendant of the Shinto sun goddess Amaterasu, and the legitimacy of the ruling house rested on this divine appointment. The name of the country as well as the design of the flag reflect this central importance of the sun. The ancient history says that Emperor Monmu used a flag representing the sun in his court in 701, the first recorded use of a sun-motif flag in Japan. The oldest existing flag is preserved in Unpō-ji temple, Kōshū, Yamanashi, which is older than the 16th century, and an ancient legend says that the flag was given to the temple by Emperor Go-Reizei in the 11th century. During the Meiji Restoration, the sun disc and the Rising Sun Ensign of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army became major symbols in the emerging Japanese Empire. Propaganda posters, textbooks, and films depicted the flag as a source of pride and patriotism. In Japanese homes, citizens were required to display the flag during national holidays, celebrations and other occasions as decreed by the government. Different tokens of devotion to Japan and its Emperor featuring the motif became popular among the public during the Second Sino-Japanese War and other conflicts. These tokens ranged from slogans written on the flag to clothing items and dishes that resembled the flag.

Public perception of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources have described the flag as a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), the use of the flag and the national anthem has been a contentious issue for Japan&#x27;s public schools, and disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. Several military banners of Japan are based on the , including the sunrayed naval ensign. The also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.

==History==
===Ancient to medieval===


The exact origin of the is unknown, but the rising sun has carried symbolic meaning since the early 7th century. Japan is often referred to as &quot;the land of the rising sun&quot;. The Japanese archipelago is east of the Asian mainland, and is thus where the sun &quot;rises&quot;. In 607, an official correspondence that began with &quot;from the Emperor of the rising sun&quot; was sent to the Chinese Emperor Yang of Sui.

The sun is closely related to the Imperial family, as legend states the imperial throne was descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu. The religion, which is categorized as the ancient Ko-Shintō religion of the Japanese people, includes nature worship and animism, and the faith has been worshiping the sun, especially in agriculture and fishing. The Imperial God, Amaterasu-ōmikami, is the sun goddess. From the Yayoi period (300 BCE) to the Kofun period (250 CE) (Yamato period), the , a large bronze mirror with patterns like a flower-petal, was used as a celebration of the shape of the shining sun and there is a theory that one of the Three Sacred Treasures, Yata no Kagami, is used like this mirror.

During the Eastern expedition, Emperor Jimmu&#x27;s brother Itsuse no Mikoto was killed in a battle against the local chieftain Nagasunehiko (&quot;the long-legged man&quot;) in Naniwa (modern-day Osaka). Emperor Jimmu realized, as a descendant of the sun, that he did not want to fight towards the sun (to the east), but to fight from the sun (to the west). The Emperor&#x27;s clan therefore went to the east side of Kii Peninsula to battle westward. They reached Kumano (or Ise) and went towards Yamato. They were victorious at the second battle with Nagasunehiko and conquered the Kinki region.

The use of the sun-shaped flag was thought to have taken place since the emperor&#x27;s direct imperial rule () was established after the Isshi Incident in 645 (first year of the Taika).

The Japanese history text , completed in 797, has the first recorded use of the sun-motif flag by Emperor Monmu&#x27;s in 701 (the first year of the Taihō era). For the decoration of the ceremony hall on New Year&#x27;s Day the was raised.

One prominent theory is influenced by the results of the Genpei War (1180–1185). Until the Heian period, the , a symbol of the Imperial Court, had a golden sun circle and a silver moon circle on a red background. At the end of the Heian era, the Taira clan called themselves a government army and used the red flag with a as per the Imperial Court. The Genji (Minamoto clan) were in opposition so they used a white flag with a when they fought the Genpei War (1180–1185). When the Taira clan was defeated, the was formed by the Genji. The warlords who came after such as Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu realized they were successors of Genji, and so raised the flag in battle.

In the 12th-century work &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, it was written that different samurai carried drawings of the sun on their fans. One legend related to the national flag is attributed to the Buddhist priest Nichiren. Supposedly, during a 13th-century Mongolian invasion of Japan, Nichiren gave a sun banner to the to carry into battle.

During the Battle of Nagashino (28 June 1575), Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s allied forces fought Takeda Katsuyori. Both Nobunaga and Ieyasu had their own flags with family crests, but they also held the . On the other hand, the Takeda clan side also raised the . Therefore, the was used as a national symbol.

One of Japan&#x27;s oldest flags is housed at the Unpo-ji temple in Kōshū city, Yamanashi Prefecture. Legend states it was given by Emperor Go-Reizei to Minamoto no Yoshimitsu and has been treated as a family treasure by the Takeda clan for the past 1,000 years, and is at least older than 16th century.

In the 16th century unification period, each had flags that were used primarily in battle. Most of the flags were long banners usually charged with the (family crest) of the lord. Members of the same family would have had different flags to carry into battle. The flags served as identification and were displayed by soldiers on their backs and horses. Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers&#x27; flags due to their square shape.

In 1854, during the Tokugawa shogunate, Japanese ships were ordered to hoist the to distinguish themselves from foreign ships. Before then, different types of flags were used on vessels that were trading with the U.S. and Russia. The was decreed the merchant flag of Japan in 1870 and was the legal national flag from 1870 to 1885, making it the first national flag Japan adopted.

While the idea of national symbols was strange to the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them to communicate with the outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry in Yokohama Bay. Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem and the imperial seal. In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished. Because of this ruling by the new cabinet of Japan, the was the &quot;de facto&quot; national flag since no law was in place after the Meiji Restoration.

===Early conflicts and the Pacific War===

The use of the national flag grew as Japan sought to develop an empire, and the was present at celebrations after victories in the First Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. The flag was also used in war efforts throughout the country. A Japanese propaganda film in 1934 portrayed foreign national flags as incomplete or defective with their designs, whilst portraying the Japanese flag as perfect in all forms. In 1937, a group of girls from Hiroshima Prefecture showed solidarity with Japanese soldiers fighting in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, by eating &quot;flag meals&quot; that consisted of an umeboshi in the middle of a bed of rice. The became the main symbol of Japan&#x27;s war mobilization and solidarity with its soldiers until the 1940s.

Japan&#x27;s early victories in the Sino-Japanese War resulted in the again being used for celebrations. It was seen in the hands of every Japanese during parades.

Textbooks during this period also had the printed with various slogans expressing devotion to the Emperor and the country. Patriotism was taught as a virtue to Japanese children. Expressions of patriotism, such as displaying the flag or worshiping the Emperor daily, were all part of being a &quot;good Japanese&quot;.

The flag was a tool of Japanese imperialism in the occupied Southeast Asian areas during the Second World War: people had to use the flag, and schoolchildren sang in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.

During the Pacific War, Americans coined the derogatory term &quot;meatballs&quot; for the and Japanese military aircraft insignia. To the Japanese, the was the &quot;Rising Sun flag that would light the darkness of the entire world&quot;. To Westerners, it was one of the Japanese military&#x27;s most powerful symbols.

===U.S. occupation=== 
The was the &quot;de facto&quot; flag of Japan throughout World War II and the occupation period. During the occupation of Japan after World War II, permission from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAPJ) was needed to fly the . Sources differ on the degree to which the use of the flag was restricted; some use the term &quot;banned;&quot; however, while the original restrictions were severe, they did not amount to an outright ban.

After World War II, an ensign was used by Japanese civil ships of the United States Naval Shipping Control Authority for Japanese Merchant Marines. Modified from the &quot;E&quot; signal code, the ensign was used from September 1945 until the U.S. occupation of Japan ceased. U.S. ships operating in Japanese waters used a modified &quot;O&quot; signal flag as their ensign.

On 2 May 1947, General Douglas MacArthur lifted the restrictions on displaying the in the grounds of the National Diet Building, on the Imperial Palace, on the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence, and on the Supreme Court building with the ratification of the new Constitution of Japan. Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed to fly the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and anyone could fly the at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to fly the until the early 1950s.

===Postwar to 1999===
Since World War II, Japan&#x27;s flag has been criticized for its association with the country&#x27;s militaristic past. Similar objections have also been raised to the current national anthem of Japan, . The feelings about the and represented a general shift from a patriotic feeling about (Great Japan) to the pacifist and anti-militarist . Because of this ideological shift, the flag was used less often in Japan directly after the war even though restrictions were lifted by the SCAPJ in 1949.

As Japan began to re-establish itself diplomatically, the was used as a political weapon overseas. In a visit by Emperor Hirohito and Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that he either be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new Status of Forces Agreement being negotiated between the U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.

An issue with the and national anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Before the Olympic Games, the size of the sun disc of the national flag was changed partly because the sun disc was not considered striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, chose to set the sun disc at two-thirds of the flag&#x27;s length. Fukiura also chose the flag colors for the 1964 games as well as for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.

In 1989, the death of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral issues about the national flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might have a chance to propose that the become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the on the day of the Emperor&#x27;s funeral, schools&#x27; right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff without reservations brought success to the conservatives.

===Since 1999===
The &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem&quot; was passed in 1999, choosing both the and as Japan&#x27;s national symbols. The passage of the law stemmed from the suicide of the principal of Sera High School in Sera, Hiroshima, Toshihiro Ishikawa, who could not resolve a dispute between his school board and his teachers over the use of the and . The Act is one of the most controversial laws passed by the Diet since the 1992 &quot;Law Concerning Cooperation for United Nations Peacekeeping Operations and Other Operations&quot;, also known as the &quot;International Peace Cooperation Law&quot;.

Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided to draft legislation to make the and official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation to be completed by the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito&#x27;s enthronement. This is not the first time legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play , Tanaka wanted students to raise the flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Tanaka was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.

The main supporters of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (JCP), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue to be decided by the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. DPJ President and future prime minister Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools. Hatoyama voted for the bill while Kan voted against it.

Before the vote, there were calls for the bills to be separated at the Diet. Waseda University professor Norihiro Kato stated that is a separate issue more complex than the flag. Attempts to designate only the as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on 22 July 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on 28 July and was passed on 9 August. It was enacted into law on 13 August.

On 8 August 2009, a photograph was taken at a DPJ rally for the House of Representatives election showing a banner that was hanging from a ceiling. The banner was made of two flags cut and sewn together to form the shape of the DPJ logo. This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the and should not be regarded as such.

==Flag design==

Passed in 1870, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Proclamation No. 57 had two provisions related to the national flag. The first provision specified who flew the flag and how it was flown; the second specified how the flag was made. The ratio was seven units width and ten units length (7:10). The red disc, which represents the sun, was calculated to be three-fifths of the hoist width. The law decreed the disc to be in the center, but it was usually placed one-hundredth () towards the hoist. (This makes the disc appear centered when the flag is flying; this technique is used in other flags, such as those of Bangladesh and Palau.) On 3 October of the same year, regulations about the design of the merchant ensign and other naval flags were passed. For the merchant flag, the ratio was two units width and three units length (2:3). The size of the disc remained the same, but the sun disc was placed one-twentieth () towards the hoist.

When the &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem&quot; passed, the dimensions of the flag were slightly altered. The overall ratio of the flag was changed to two units width by three units length (2:3). The red disc was shifted towards the center, but the overall size of the disc stayed the same. The background of the flag is white and the center is a , but the exact color shades were not defined in the 1999 law. The only hint given about the red colour is that it is a &quot;deep&quot; shade.

Issued by the Japan Defense Agency (now the Ministry of Defense) in 1973 (Shōwa 48), specifications list the red color of the flag as 5R 4/12 and the white as N9 in the Munsell color chart. The document was changed on 21 March 2008 (Heisei 20) to match the flag&#x27;s construction with current legislation and updated the Munsell colours. The document lists acrylic fiber and nylon as fibers that could be used in construction of flags used by the military. For acrylic, the red color is 5.7R 3.7/15.5 and white is N9.4; nylon has 6.2R 4/15.2 for red and N9.2 for white. In a document issued by the Official Development Assistance (ODA), the red color for the and the ODA logo is listed as DIC 156 and CMYK 0-100-90-0. During deliberations about the &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem&quot;, there was a suggestion to either use a shade or use one from the color pool of the Japanese Industrial Standards.

==Use and customs==
When the was first introduced, the government required citizens to greet the Emperor with the flag. There was some resentment among the Japanese over the flag, resulting in some protests. It took some time for the flag to gain acceptance among the people.

Before World War II, all homes were required to display on national holidays. Since the war, the display of the flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes or commercial buildings, but some people and companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the during national holidays, they are not legally required to do so. Since the Emperor&#x27;s 80th birthday on 23 December 2002, the Kyushu Railway Company has displayed the at 330 stations.

Starting in 1995, the ODA has used the motif in their official logo. The design itself was not created by the government (the logo was chosen from 5,000 designs submitted by the public) but the government was trying to increase the visualization of the through their aid packages and development programs. According to the ODA, the use of the flag is the most effective way to symbolise aid provided by the Japanese people.

During World War II, it was a popular custom for friends, classmates, and relatives of a deploying soldier to sign a and present it to him. The flag was also used as a good luck charm and a prayer to wish the soldier back safely from battle. One term for this kind of charm is . One tradition is that no writing should touch the sun disc. After battles, these flags were often captured or later found on deceased Japanese soldiers. Some of these flags have become souvenirs, and some have been returned to Japan and the descendants of the deceased.

In modern times, the is still being used. The tradition of signing the as a good luck charm still continues, though in a limited fashion. The is shown at sporting events to give support to the Japanese national team. The is used for campaigning soldiers, athletes, retirees, transfer students in a community and for friends. The colored paper and flag has writing with a message. In modern Japan, it is given as a present to a person at a send-off party, for athletes, a farewell party for colleagues or transfer students, for graduation and retirement. After natural disasters such as the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake and tsunami people write notes on a to show support.


The is a white headband (bandana) with the red sun in the middle. Phrases are usually written on it. It is worn as a symbol of perseverance, effort, and/or courage by the wearer. These are worn on many occasions by for example sports spectators, women giving birth, students in cram school, office workers, tradesmen taking pride in their work etc. During World War II, the phrases or &quot;Seven Lives&quot; was written on the and worn by kamikaze pilots. This denoted that the pilot was willing to die for his country.


 and are types of Japanese lunch boxes, which can feature . The consists of  (steamed white rice) with a red (dried plum) in the center which represents the sun and the flag of Japan. A only has white rice and a red in the center. The salty, vinegar-soaked acts as a preservative for the rice. There are also rice bowls, which are less common.

==Culture and perception==
According to polls conducted by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived the flag of Japan as the national flag even before the passage of the &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem&quot; in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as the and often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships&#x27; political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.

The display of the national flag at homes and businesses is also debated in Japanese society. Because of its association with (right wing) activists, reactionary politics, or hooliganism, most homes and businesses do not fly the flag. There is no requirement to fly the flag on any national holiday or special events. The town of Kanazawa, Ishikawa proposed plans in September 2012 to use government funds to buy flags with the purpose of encouraging citizens to fly the flag on national holidays.

Negative perceptions of the national flag exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa Prefecture. In one notable example of this, on 26 October 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the flag before the start of the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of . In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city&#x27;s 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Republic of Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, U.S.-Japan military cooperation, and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippine government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the , whereas foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan.

==Protocol==
According to protocol, the flag may fly from sunrise until sunset; businesses and schools are permitted to fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time in Japan, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and the flag of the guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be at the same height and of equal size. When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan&#x27;s flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem&quot; does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the and other prefectural flags.

===Mourning===

The flag has at least two mourning styles. One is to display the flag at , as is common in many countries. The offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also hoist the flag at half-staff when a funeral is performed for a foreign nation&#x27;s head of state.

An alternative mourning style is to wrap the spherical finial with black cloth and place a black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style dates back to the death of Emperor Meiji on 30 July 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.

===Public schools===
Since the end of World War II, the Ministry of Education has issued statements and regulations to promote the usage of both the and (national anthem) at schools under their jurisdiction. The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect must be given to it and to . Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms.

The 1999 curriculum guideline issued by the Ministry of Education after the passage of the &quot;Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem&quot; decrees that &quot;on entrance and graduation ceremonies, schools must raise the flag of Japan and instruct students to sing the , given the significance of the flag and the song.&quot; Additionally, the ministry&#x27;s commentary on the 1999 curriculum guideline for elementary schools note that &quot;given the advance of internationalization, along with fostering patriotism and awareness of being Japanese, it is important to nurture school children&#x27;s respectful attitude toward the flag of Japan and as they grow up to be respected Japanese citizens in an internationalized society.&quot; The ministry also stated that if Japanese students cannot respect their own symbols, then they will not be able to respect the symbols of other nations.

Schools have been the center of controversy over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education requires the use of both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the and . After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.

===Military flags===
The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force use the Rising Sun Flag with eight red rays extending outward, called . A gold border is situated partially around the edge.

A well-known variant of the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan&#x27;s military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the war flag on 15 May 1870, and was used until the end of World War II in 1945. It was re-adopted on 30 June 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). JSDF Chief of Staff Katsutoshi Kawano said the Rising Sun Flag is the Maritime Self-Defense Force sailors&#x27; &quot;pride&quot;. Due to its continued use by the Imperial Japanese Army, this flag carries the negative connotation similar to the Nazi flag in China and Korea. These formerly colonised countries state that this flag is a symbol of Japanese imperialism during World War II, and was an ongoing conflict event for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The JMSDF also employs the use of a masthead pennant. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead pennant contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at the hoist end, with the rest of the pennant colored white. The ratio of the pennant is between 1:40 and 1:90.

The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), established independently in 1952, has only the plain sun disc as its emblem. This is the only branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch does have an ensign to fly on bases and during parades. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force flag was first adopted in 1955 after the JASDF was created in 1954. The flag is cobalt blue with a gold winged eagle on top of a combined star, the moon, the sun disc and clouds. The latest version of the JASDF flag was re-adopted on 19 March 2001.

Although not an official national flag, the Z signal flag played a major role in Japanese naval history. On 27 May 1905, Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō of the was preparing to engage the Russian Baltic Fleet. Before the Battle of Tsushima began, Togo raised the Z flag on the and engaged the Russian fleet, winning the battle for Japan. The raising of the flag said to the crew the following: &quot;The fate of Imperial Japan hangs on this one battle; all hands will exert themselves and do their best.&quot; The Z flag was also raised on the aircraft carrier on the eve of Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in December 1941.

===Imperial flags===
Beginning in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and other members of the imperial family. At first, the Emperor&#x27;s flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.

The current Emperor&#x27;s flag is a , colored in gold, centered on a red background with a 2:3 ratio. The Empress uses the same flag, except the shape is that of a swallow tail. The crown prince and the crown princess use the same flags, except with a smaller chrysanthemum and a white border in the middle of the flags. The chrysanthemum has been associated with the Imperial throne since the rule of Emperor Go-Toba in the 12th century, but it did not become the exclusive symbol of the Imperial throne until 1868.

===Subnational flags===
Each of the 47 prefectures of Japan has its own flag which, like the national flag, consists of a symbol – called a – charged upon a monocolored field (except for Ehime Prefecture, where the background is bicolored). There are several prefecture flags, such as Hiroshima&#x27;s, that match their specifications to the national flag (2:3 ratio, placed in the center and is the length of the flag). Some of the display the name of the prefecture in Japanese characters; others are stylized depictions of the location or another special feature of the prefecture. An example of a prefectural flag is that of Nagano, where the orange character appears in the center of a white disc. One interpretation of the is that the symbol represents a mountain and the white disc, a lake. The orange color represents the sun while the white color represents the snow of the region.

Municipalities can also adopt flags of their own. The designs of the city flags are similar to the prefectural flags: a on a monocolored background. An example is the flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is composed of the character ✓and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a white flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.

===Derivatives===

In addition to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the with a red horizontal bar placed in the center of the flag. There was also a thin white ring around the red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the 〒 postal mark in red on a white background.

Two recently-designed national flags resemble the Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag that had a green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The current flag, adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes the blood that was shed to create their country. The island nation of Palau uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme is completely different. While the Government of Palau does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer Palau from 1914 until 1944. The flag of Palau is an off-centered golden-yellow full moon on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau&#x27;s transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.

The Japanese naval ensign also influenced other flag designs. One such flag design is used by the . At the bottom hoist of the flag, one quarter of the sun is displayed. The kanji character is displayed on the flag, colored white, covering most of the sun. The rays extend from the sun, occurring in a red and white alternating order, culminating in 13 total stripes. The flag is commonly seen at the National High School Baseball Championship, as the is a main sponsor of the tournament. The rank flags and ensigns of the Imperial Japanese Navy also based their designs on the naval ensign.

<text>Peter Bales (1547–1610?) was an English calligrapher and one of the inventors of shorthand writing. He was born in London in 1547, and is described by Anthony Wood as a &quot;most dexterous person in his profession, to the great wonder of scholars and others&quot;. We are also informed that &quot;he spent several years in sciences among Oxonians, particularly, as it seems, in Gloucester Hall; but that study, which he used for a diversion only, proved at length an employment of profit.&quot; He is mentioned for his skill in micrography in &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;.

John Evelyn wrote:
Bales was likewise very dexterous in imitating handwritings, and between 1576 and 1590 was employed by Secretary Walsingham in certain political manoeuvres. We find him at the head of a school near the Old Bailey, London, in 1590, in which year he published his &quot;Writing Schoolemaster, in three Parts&quot;. This book included an &quot;Arte of Brachygraphie&quot;, one of the earliest attempts to construct a system of shorthand. In 1595 he had a great trial of skill with one Daniel Johnson, for a golden pen valued at £20, and won it; and a contemporary author further relates that he had also the arms of calligraphy given him, which are &quot;azure, a pen or&quot; (blue with a gold pen). Bales died about the year 1610.

<text>&quot;The Last Flight&quot; is the eighteenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Part of the production was filmed on location at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California. The vintage 1918 Nieuport 28 biplane was both owned and flown by Frank Gifford Tallman, and had previously appeared in many World War I motion pictures.

Harry Raybould plays an unnamed Corporal, Jerry Catron plays an unnamed guard, Paul Baxley plays an unnamed driver (uncredited), and Jack Perkins plays an unnamed ground crewman (uncredited).

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Flight Lieutenant William Terrance &quot;Terry&quot; Decker of 56 Squadron Royal Flying Corps lands his Nieuport biplane on an American airbase in France after flying through a strange cloud. He is immediately accosted by provost marshal Major Wilson, who is dumbfounded by Decker&#x27;s archaic appearance. Decker, likewise, is baffled, but by the unexplainable large modern aircraft. He is then taken into custody and questioned by the American base commander, Major General George Harper, and by Wilson. Decker snaps to attention, identifying himself as being from the UK&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps (the predecessor of the modern Royal Air Force). Harper and Wilson are also puzzled by his antiquated uniform. Decker asks where he is. When asked the date, Decker answers March 5, 1917. When they inform him it is March 5, 1959, he is stunned.

Decker learns that his flying partner, Alexander Mackaye, is an air vice-marshal and a hero in World War II who saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives by shooting down three German bombers over London one night during the Blitz. By chance, Mackaye is coming to the base that very day for an inspection. Decker says that is impossible, as Mackaye is dead. Harper, at this time, confiscates Decker&#x27;s pistol and personal effects. Later, Major Wilson questions the young man. Decker refers to Mackaye by a private nickname, &quot;Old Leadbottom&quot;, explaining that at one point, he was shot in an embarrassing spot by German infantry. Decker finally confesses that he is a coward who avoided combat throughout his service, and that he deliberately abandoned Mackaye when the two were attacked by a flight of German fighters. He refuses to believe that Mackaye somehow survived against such odds.

When Wilson suggests that someone helped him, Decker realizes that he has been given a second chance. He tells the American officer that there was no one within 50 miles who could have come to Mackaye&#x27;s aid, so if Mackaye survived, it had to be because Decker went back himself. Decker pleads with Wilson to release him. When Wilson refuses, Decker assaults him and a guard and escapes. Outside, he locates his plane, punches a mechanic who tries to get in his way, and starts the plane&#x27;s engine. He is about to take off when Wilson catches up and puts a pistol to his head. Decker tells Wilson he will have to shoot him to stop him. After hesitating, Wilson lets him go. Decker flies into the strange cloud and vanishes.

Harper rebukes Wilson for believing such a fantastic story and for allowing &quot;that maniac&quot; to escape. When Mackaye arrives, Wilson asks him if he knows a William Terrance Decker; he replies, &quot;Oh I certainly should know him—he saved my life.&quot; Mackaye proceeds to recount how Decker and he were jumped by seven German aircraft while out on patrol. Mackaye thought at first that Decker had fled, but suddenly Decker came diving down, seemingly out of nowhere, with his guns blazing, and proceeded to shoot down three enemy planes before being shot down himself. General Harper then shows him Decker&#x27;s confiscated identification card (with a photo) and other personal effects. This leaves Mackaye stunned. When he demands an explanation, Wilson says, &quot;Maybe you&#x27;d better sit down, Old Leadbottom.&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* Kenneth Haigh as 2Lt. William Terrance ‘Terry’ Decker
* Alexander Scourby as Maj. Gen. George Harper
* Simon Scott as Maj. Wilson
* Robert Warwick as A.V.M Alexander ‘Leadbottom’ Mackaye, R.A.F
* Rod Serling as Narrator (uncredited)

==Episode notes==
This was the first episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; scripted by Richard Matheson. Rod Serling had previously adapted the episodes &quot;And When the Sky Was Opened&quot; and &quot;Third from the Sun&quot; from short stories of Matheson&#x27;s.

Radio historian Martin Grams Jr. noted the similarities between this episode and a 1948 episode of the acclaimed radio drama series &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; called &quot;One for the Book&quot;. According to Grams&#x27; book &quot;The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic&quot;, Serling himself was so concerned about the similarities that he attempted to buy the rights to the &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; episode to avoid any potential copyright infringement.

The American &quot;airbase in France&quot; where this episode was filmed was actually Norton Air Force Base, a former USAF base in San Bernadino, California now known as San Bernardino International Airport.

<text>Inverness (; ; from the , meaning &quot;Mouth of the River Ness&quot;) is a city in the Scottish Highlands, having been granted city status in 2000. It is the administrative centre for The Highland Council and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands.

Historically it served as the county town of the county of Inverness-shire. Inverness lies near two important battle sites: the 11th-century battle of Blàr nam Fèinne against Norway which took place on the Aird, and the 18th century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor. It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen (Gleann Mòr) at its northeastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Beauly Firth. 

With human settlement dating back to at least 5,800 BC, Inverness was an established self-governing settlement by the 6th century with the first Royal Charter being granted by Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (King David I) around 1160. Inverness and Inverness-shire are closely linked to various influential clans, including Clan Mackintosh, Clan Fraser and Clan MacKenzie.

The population of Inverness grew from 40,969 in 2001 to 46,969 in 2012, according to &quot;World Population Review&quot;. The Greater Inverness area, including Culloden and Westhill, had a population of 56,969 in 2012. In 2016, it had a population of 63,320. Inverness is one of Europe&#x27;s fastest growing cities, with a quarter of the Highland population living in or around it. In 2008, Inverness was ranked fifth out of 189 British cities for its quality of life, the highest of any Scottish city.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
Much of what is known about Inverness&#x27;s prehistory comes from archaeological work that takes place before construction/development work as part of the planning process.

Between 2009 and 2010, archaeological work in advance of the creation of flood defences to the south of the city at Knocknagael Farm by GUARD Archaeology discovered an archaeological site that showed humans had been living in the Inverness area from at least 6500 BC, the Late Mesolithic period. That same site showed people living/working in the area from the mid-7th millennium BC into the Late Iron Age (1st millennium AD) with most activity taking place in the Early Neolithic (4th millennium BC). The archaeologists also found a piece of flint from Yorkshire that showed that people in Inverness may have been trading with Yorkshire during the Neolithic.

Between 1996 and 1997, CFA Archaeology (then part of the University of Edinburgh) undertook excavations of crop marks in the west of Inverness in advance of the construction of a retail and business park. A Bronze Age cemetery was discovered in 1996 and in 1997 the archaeologists found the remains of a Bronze Age settlement and an Iron Age settlement, with an ironsmith. It is one the earliest examples of iron smithing in Scotland. The Iron Age settlement had Roman brooches from the AD 1st–2nd centuries, indicating trade with the Roman Empire. Similarly, the Bronze Age site showed signs of metal production: finds included ceramic piece-moulds designed for the casting of Late Bronze Age leaf-shaped swords. A silver chain dating to 500–800 CE was found just to the south of Torvean, during the excavation of the Caledonian Canal, in 1809.

==History==
=== Picts ===
Inverness was one of the chief strongholds of the Picts. In AD 569, it was visited by St Columba with the intention of converting the Pictish king Brude, who is supposed to have resided in the vitrified fort on Craig Phadrig, on the western edge of the city. A church or a monk&#x27;s cell is thought to have been established by early Celtic monks on St Michael&#x27;s Mount, a mound close to the river, now the site of the Old High Church and graveyard.

=== Medieval ===
The first royal charter was granted by Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (King David I) in the 12th century. The Gaelic king Mac Bethad Mac Findláich (MacBeth) whose 11th-century killing of King Duncan was immortalised in Shakespeare&#x27;s largely fictionalised play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, held a castle within the city where he ruled as Mormaer of Moray and Ross.

Inverness Castle is said to have been built by Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III) of Scotland, after he had razed to the ground the castle in which Mac Bethad mac Findláich had, according to much later tradition, murdered Máel Coluim&#x27;s father Donnchad (Duncan I), and which stood on a hill around 1 km to the north-east.

The strategic location of Inverness has led to many conflicts in the area. Reputedly there was a battle in the early 11th century between Malcolm III and Thorfinn the Mighty at Blar Nam Feinne, to the southwest of the city.

Inverness had four traditional fairs, including Legavrik or &quot;Leth-Gheamhradh&quot;, meaning midwinter, and Faoilleach. William the Lion (d. 1214) granted Inverness four charters, by one of which it was created a royal burgh. Of the Dominican friary founded by Alexander III in 1233, only one pillar and a worn knight&#x27;s effigy survive in a secluded graveyard near the town centre.

Medieval Inverness suffered regular raids from the Hebrides, particularly by the MacDonald Lords of the Isles in the 15th century. In 1187, one Dòmhnall Bàn (Donald Ban) led islanders in a battle at Torvean against men from Inverness Castle led by the governor&#x27;s son, Donnchadh Mac an Tòisich (Duncan Mackintosh). Both leaders were killed in the battle, and Dòmhnall Bàn is said to have been buried in a large cairn near the river, close to where the silver chain was found. Local tradition says that the citizens fought off the Clan Donald in 1340 at the Battle of Blairnacoi on Drumderfit Hill, north of Inverness across the Beauly Firth. In the late 14th-early 15 century, Inverness was a symbol of the Duke of Albany&#x27;s power. On his way to the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, Donald of Islay took the town and burned the bridge over the River Ness. Sixteen years later, James I held a parliament in the castle to which the northern chieftains were summoned, of whom three were arrested for defying the king&#x27;s command. Clan Munro defeated Clan Mackintosh in 1454 at the Battle of Clachnaharry just west of the city. Clan Donald and their allies stormed the castle during the Raid on Ross in 1491.

=== Post-medieval ===
In 1562, during the progress undertaken to suppress Huntly&#x27;s insurrection, Mary, Queen of Scots, was denied admittance into Inverness Castle by the governor, who belonged to the earl&#x27;s faction, and whom she afterwards caused to be hanged. The Clan Munro and Clan Fraser of Lovat took the castle for her. The house in which she lived meanwhile stood in Bridge Street until the 1970s, when it was demolished to make way for the second Bridge Street development.

Beyond the then northern limits of the town, Oliver Cromwell built a citadel capable of accommodating 1,000 men, but with the exception of a portion of the ramparts it was demolished at the Restoration. A clock tower today called Cromwell&#x27;s Tower is located in the Citadel area of Inverness but was actually part of a former hemp cloth factory built c. 1765.

Inverness played a role in the Jacobite rising of 1689. In early May, it was besieged by a contingent of Jacobites led by MacDonell of Keppoch. The town was actually rescued by Viscount Dundee, the overall Jacobite commander, when he arrived with the main Jacobite army, although he required Inverness to profess loyalty to King James VII.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
In 1715 the Jacobites occupied the royal fortress as a barracks. In 1727 the government built the first Fort George here, but in 1746 it surrendered to the Jacobites and they blew it up. Culloden Moor lies nearby, and was the site of the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which ended the Jacobite rising of 1745–46.

In 1783, the year that saw the end of the American Revolution and the beginning of the Highland Clearances in Inverness-shire, Coinneach MacChoinnich (1758–1837), a poet from Clan MacKenzie who was born at Castle Heather, then known as Castle Leather (&quot;Caisteal Leothair&quot;), composed the Gaelic poem &quot;The Lament of the North&quot;. In the poem, MacChionnich mocks the Highland gentry for becoming absentee landlords, evicting their tenants en masse in favor of sheep, and of &quot;spending their wealth uselessly&quot;, in London. He accuses King George III both of tyranny and of steering the ship of state into shipwreck. MacChionnich also argues that truth is on the side of George Washington and the Continental Army and that the Scottish Gaels would do well to emigrate to the New World before the King and the landlords take every farthing they have left.

=== Recent history ===
The Rose Street drill hall was completed in around 1908. On 7 September 1921, the first British Cabinet meeting to be held outside London took place in the Inverness Town House, when David Lloyd George, on holiday in Gairloch, called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Ireland. The Inverness Formula composed at this meeting was the basis of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

Inverness has experienced rapid economic growth in the 21st century - between 1998 and 2008, Inverness and the rest of the central Highlands showed the largest growth of average economic productivity per person in Scotland and the second-greatest growth in the United Kingdom as a whole, with an increase of 86%. It was awarded the Nicholson Trophy (class 2 category) for the best town with between 20,000 and 50,000 inhabitants at Britain in Bloom contest in 1975. In 2014, a survey by a property website described Inverness as the happiest place in Scotland and the second-happiest in the UK. Inverness was again found to be the happiest place in Scotland by a study conducted in 2015.

Residents of Inverness expressed their disapproval of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, known by the title &quot;Earl of Inverness&quot;, following sexual assault allegations being made against him by Virginia Giuffre. In 2019, Inverness residents started a campaign to strip him of that title, stating that &quot;it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew is associated with our beautiful city.&quot;

==Demography==
===Toponymy===
Inverness and its immediate hinterland have a large number of originally Gaelic place names, as the area was solidly Gaelic-speaking until the late 19th century.

Several springs which were traditionally thought to have healing qualities exist around Inverness. &quot;Fuaran Dearg&quot;, which translates as the &quot;Red Spring&quot;, is a chalybeate spring located near Dochgarroch. &quot;Fuaran a&#x27; Chladaich &quot;(&quot;The Spring on the Beach&quot;) near Bunchrew was once accessed by a causeway from the shore. Although submerged at high tide it continues to bubble and was traditionally known for treating cholera. &quot;Fuaran Allt an Ionnlaid&quot; (&quot;Well of the Washing Burn&quot;) at Clachnaharry, where the Marquis of Montrose was allowed to drink while on his way from his capture in Sutherland to his execution in Edinburgh, was known for treating skin conditions. Also at Clachnaharry, &quot;Fuaran Priseag&quot; (&quot;The Precious Well&quot;) was said to have been blessed by Saint Kessock and could treat weak and sore eyes, as well as expelling evil and shielding curses if a silver coin was offered. &quot;Tobar na h-Oige&quot; (&quot;Well of the Young&quot;) is located near Culloden and was known for curing all ailments. &quot;Fuaran a&#x27; Chragan Bhreag&quot; (&quot;Well of the Speckled Rock&quot;) is located near Craig Dundain and &quot;Fuaran na Capaich&quot; (&quot;The Keppoch Well&quot;) is located near Culloden. Inverness is also home to the Munlochy Clootie Well.

Although a Gaelic name itself, &quot;Craig Phadraig&quot; is alternatively known as &quot;Làrach an Taigh Mhóir&quot;, or &quot;the place of the Great house&quot;. Several Gaelic place names are now largely obsolete due to the feature being removed or forgotten. &quot;Drochaid an Easain Duibh&quot; (&quot;Bridge by the Small Dark Waterfall&quot;), referred to in the tale &quot;Aonghas Mòr Thom na h-Iubhraich agus na Sìthichean&quot; (&quot;Great Angus of Tomnahurich and the Fairies&quot;) has not yet been located within Inverness and &quot;Slag nam Mèirleach&quot; (meaning &quot;Robbers&#x27; hollow&quot;), adjacent to Dores Road in Holm is no longer in use. Until the late 19th century, four mussel beds existed on the delta mouth of the River Ness: &quot;Scalp Phàdraig Mhòir&quot; (&quot;Scalp of Great Patrick&quot;), &quot;Rònach&quot; (&quot;Place of the Seals&quot;), &quot;Cridhe an Uisge&quot; (&quot;The Water Heart&quot;) and &quot;Scalp nan Caorach&quot; (&quot;Scalp of the Sheep&quot;) – these mussel beds were all removed to allow better access for fishing boats and ships.

&quot;Allt Muineach&quot; (The Thicket River) now runs underground between Culcabock Roundabout and Millburn Roundabout. &quot;An Loch Gorm&quot; (The Turquoise Loch), a small sea loch which was situated beside Morrisons supermarket, was filled in during the 19th century and lives on only in the name of Lochgorm Warehouse. Abban Street stems from the word &quot;àban&quot;, a word of local Gaelic dialect meaning a small channel of water.

Many prominent points around Inverness retain fully Gaelic names.

* Beinn Bhuidhe Bheag – &quot;Little Yellow Hill&quot;
* Beinn Uan – &quot;Lamb Hill&quot;
* Cnoc na Mòine – &quot;The Peat Hill&quot;
* Cnoc na Gaoithe – &quot;The Hill of the Wind&quot;
* Cnoc an t-Seòmair – &quot;The Hill of the Room&quot;
* Creag Liath – &quot;Grey Crag&quot;
* Creag nan Sidhean – &quot;The Crag of the Fairies&quot;
* Doire Mhòr – &quot;Great Oakwood&quot;
* Carn a&#x27; Bhodaich – &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Cairn&quot;
* Meall Mòr – &quot;Great Hill&quot;
In the colonial period, a Gaelic-speaking settlement named New Inverness was established in McIntosh County, Georgia, by settlers from in and around Inverness. The name was also given by expatriates to settlements in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Montana, Florida, Illinois, and California. The name Inverness is also given to a feature on Miranda, a moon of the planet Uranus, as well as a 2637 m tall mountain in British Columbia, Canada. Inverness is also known by its nicknames &quot;Inversnecky&quot; or &quot;The Sneck&quot;, with its inhabitants traditionally known as &quot;Clann Na Cloiche&quot; (&quot;Children of the Stone&quot; in Gaelic) owing to the importance of the Clach Na Cudainn stone in the city&#x27;s history. This large flat stone is now located outside the town hall, by the historic Mercat Cross. The stone was originally at the river Ness, where the towns women took their laundry. They would rest their tubs on the stone, thus it became known as the stone of the tubs - &#x27;clach na cudainn&#x27;.

===Population===

The National Records of Scotland define Inverness as the urban area west of the A9. To produce a greater Inverness figure including the villages of Balloch, Culloden, Smithton, and Westhill, it is necessary to aggregate NRS figures for each locality.

==Geography==
===Location===
Inverness is situated at the mouth of the River Ness (which flows from nearby Loch Ness) and at the south-western extremity of the Moray Firth. The city lies at the end of the Great Glen with Loch Ness, Loch Ashie and Loch Duntelchaig to the west. Inverness&#x27;s Caledonian Canal also runs through the Great Glen, connecting Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy.

The Ness Islands, a publicly owned park, consists of two wooded islands connected by footbridges and has been used as a place of recreation since the 1840s. Craig Phadraig, once an ancient Gaelic and Pictish hillfort, is a hill which offers hikes on a clear pathway through the wooded terrain.

Inverness lies on the Great Glen Fault. There are minor earthquakes, usually unnoticed by locals, about every 3 years. The last earthquake to affect Inverness was in 1934.


===Climate===
Like most of the United Kingdom, Inverness has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). The climate here is cooler than in more southerly parts of Britain. The highest temperature recorded was in July 2006 and June 2018, and the lowest temperature recorded was in January 2010. Typically, the warmest day of the year rises to around and the coldest night falls to around . The climate in this area is characterised by relatively small differences between annual high and low temperatures, as well as adequate rainfall year-round.

==Health==

Raigmore Hospital is the main hospital in Inverness and the entire Highland region. The present hospital opened in 1970, replacing wartime wards dating from 1941.

Raigmore is a teaching hospital for the universities of Aberdeen and Stirling. A Centre for Health Science (CfHS) is located behind the hospital. This is funded by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Government and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Phase I of this opened in early 2007, with phase II and phase III housing The Diabetes Institute opening in 2009. The University of Stirling moved its nursing and midwifery teaching operations from Raigmore Hospital to the CfHS. The University of the Highlands and Islands also has strong links with the Centre through its Faculty of Health.

==Economy==


Most of the traditional industries such as distilling have been replaced by high-tech businesses, such as the design and manufacture of diabetes diagnostic kits (by LifeScan). Highlands and Islands Enterprise has principally funded the Centre for Health Science to attract more businesses in the medical and medical devices business to the area. Inverness is home to Scottish Natural Heritage following that body&#x27;s relocation from Edinburgh under the auspices of the Scottish Government&#x27;s decentralisation strategy. SNH provides a large number of jobs in the area.

Inverness City Centre lies on the east bank of the river and is linked to the west side of the town by three road bridges – Ness Bridge, Friars Bridge and the Black (or Waterloo) Bridge – and by one of the town&#x27;s suspension foot bridges, the Greig Street Bridge.

The traditional city centre was a triangle bounded by High Street, Church Street and Academy Street, within which Union Street and Queensgate are cross streets parallel to High Street. Between Union Street and Queensgate is the Victorian Market, which contains a large number of small shops.

The main Inverness railway station is almost directly opposite the Academy Street entrance to the Market. From the 1970s, the Eastgate Shopping Centre was developed to the east of High Street, with a substantial extension being completed in 2003.

==Education==
The city has a number of different education providers. Inverness is catered for by about a dozen primary schools including Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis, a specialised institution situated at Slackbuie. There are five secondary schools: Inverness High School, Inverness Royal Academy, Charleston Academy, Millburn Academy, and Culloden Academy. Additionally there is UHI Inverness which offers flexible learning opportunities from access level through to PhD. The city also has a new Centre for Health Sciences adjacent to Raigmore Hospital.

UHI Inverness is a partner of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI), an integrated university encompassing both further and higher education. The university partnership is made up of 12 colleges and research institutions located across the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire. 

In 2015, the college moved to a new location, on the Inverness Campus. The original outline planning application forms a vision for the development over the next thirty years. The application includes:

*Academic buildings – up to 70,480 m2
*Business and incubation units – up to 49,500 m2
*Indoor sports complex – up to 9,000 m2
*Student and other short term residences – 44,950 m2
*Associated landscape, open space, outdoor recreation, infrastructure and services necessary to support the development phases
*Up to 200 residential units
*A social enterprise-run hotel

The campus at Beechwood, just off the A9 east of Inverness, is considered to be one of the most important developments for the region over the next 20 years. The principal of UHI, James Fraser, said: &quot;This is a flagship development which will provide Inverness with a university campus and vibrant student life. It will have a major impact on the city and on the Highlands and Islands. UHI is a partnership of colleges and research centres throughout the region, and the development of any one partner brings strength to the whole institution.&quot;

It is estimated that the new campus would contribute more than £50m to the economy of the Highlands because it could attract innovative commercial businesses interested in research and development, while increasing the number of students who study within the city by around 3,000.

==Transport==
===Road network===
Inverness is linked to the Black Isle across the Moray Firth by the Kessock Bridge. Three trunk roads link Inverness with the rest of Scotland – the A9 north to Thurso and Wick, and south to Perth (carrying European Route E15) and the Central Belt, the A82 to Glasgow via Fort William and the A96 to Elgin and Aberdeen. Plans are in place to convert the A96 between Inverness and Nairn to a dual carriageway and to construct a southern bypass that would link the A9, A82 and A96 together involving crossings of the Caledonian Canal and the River Ness in the Torvean area, southwest of the town. The bypass, known as the Inverness Trunk Road Link (TRL), is aimed at resolving Inverness&#x27;s transport problems and has been split into two separate projects, the east and west sections. 

In late 2008 the controversial decision by the Scottish Government not to include the full Inverness bypass in its transport plan for the next 20 years was made. The government&#x27;s Strategic Transport Projects Review did include the eastern section of the route, which will see the A9 at Inshes linked to the A96. The absence of the TRL&#x27;s western section, which would include a permanent crossing over the Caledonian Canal and River Ness, sparked dismay among several Highland councillors and business leaders in Inverness who feel the bypass is vital for the city&#x27;s future economic growth. Ultimately both sections received funding from the Inverness and Highland city-region deal. The eastern section now also includes a commitment to upgrade the Longman Roundabout to a grade separated interchange.

The east section will bypass Inshes Roundabout, a notorious traffic bottleneck, using a new road linking the existing Southern Distributor with the A9 and the A96, both via grade separated interchanges. This proposed new link road would separate strategic traffic from local traffic. It will also accommodate the proposed developments at Inverness Shopping Park, West Seafield Business Park, Inverness Campus and housing developments at Ashton Farm, Stratton and Culloden West. An indicative timescale for completion of this section is the dualling of the A96 from Inverness to Nairn. The west section is intended to provide an alternate route connecting the A9 with the A82. This will bypass the city centre by providing additional crossings of the River Ness and Caledonian Canal. At the west end, two options for crossing the River Ness and Caledonian Canal were developed. One involving a high level vertical opening bridge which will allow the majority of canal traffic to pass under without the need for opening. The other involved a bridge over the river and an aqueduct under the canal. Both of these designs are technically complex and were considered in detail along by the key stakeholders involved in the project.

Ultimately it was decided that a bridge would be constructed over the River Ness and a second swing bridge be constructed over the Caledonian Canal. This second swing bridge would operate in tandem with the current swing bridge enabling a constant flow of traffic. The works started on site on the 10 June 2019 and include a roundabout, realignment of General Booth Road onto the A82, and a second bridge across the Caledonian Canal. The works were programmed to be complete in December 2020. However, due to a number of construction delays the section was opened in August 2021.

In late 2008 the Scottish Government&#x27;s transport plan for the next 20 years was announced. It brings forward planned improvements to the A9 in an attempt to stimulate the economy and protect jobs. Work costing a total of £8.5 million was undertaken at Moy, Carrbridge, and Bankfoot. Northbound overtaking lanes were created and the carriageway was reconstructed at both Moy and Carrbridge. Junction improvements were also made at Moy. In November 2011 the Scottish Government announced that it will upgrade the entire road from Perth to Inverness to dual carriageway. Work on this project is expected to start in 2015 ws scheduled to be completed in 2025, at a cost of £3 billion. However, in 2023, this project was announced to be an impossible deadline, with a mere 11 miles having been dualled since it was announced in 2011, to severe uproar from people across the Highlands, as well as neighbouring Moray, subsequently, the project was extended by a further 10 years to 2035, with Michael Gove stating that the A9 had to be dualled north of Inverness to Nigg in order to assist with the UK Government&#x27;s &quot;Levelling Up&quot; programme at the port.

In July 2013, the Scottish Government announced a plan to install average speed cameras on the A9 between Perth and Inverness. This has been undertaken with an aim to reduce accidents and fatalities on the road, and will be the second permanent average speed camera scheme in Scotland. As of October 2021, 2 sections of the upgraded route have been opened. In August 2021 the procurement process for the Tomatin to Moy section was started. Once this section is completed, there will be 20 miles (32 km) of continuous dual carriageway south of Inverness.

In December 2011, The Scottish Government announced its intention to dual the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen. The project will include upgrading the remaining 86 miles (138 km) of single carriageway along the route to dual carriageway at a cost of £3 billion. The first section to be dualled will be the section between Inverness and Auldearn. This will include a bypass of Nairn and the construction of a number of grade separated interchanges along the route.

=== Public Transport ===

Inverness bus station is situated at Farraline Park and can be accessed from Academy Street and Margaret Street. The bus station is managed by The Highland Council and is a short walk away from the Inverness railway station and the main shopping area. Permission was granted to demolish the existing bus station in 2000. It was then replaced with a new terminal building in the early 2000s. The bus station&#x27;s main operators include Stagecoach in Inverness and Stagecoach in Lochaber. Buses operate from the bus station around the town of Inverness and to Inverness Airport and to places as far afield as Fort William, Ullapool, Thurso, and Aberdeen. Megabus and Scottish Citylink operate a regular coach service to the Scotland&#x27;s capital Edinburgh with connections to Glasgow at Perth.

National Express Coaches operate an overnight service from Inverness to London (Victoria) via Edinburgh taking 15 hours 5 minutes. Stagecoach Highlands is the division of the Stagecoach Group which covers most of the former Rapson Group operations after the take-over by Stagecoach. It covers the following depots of the Stagecoach Group.

*Fort William (Ardgour Road, Caol) (t/a Stagecoach in Lochaber)
*Kirkwall (Scott&#x27;s Road Hatston Industrial Estate) (t/a Stagecoach in Orkney)
*Portree (Park Road) (t/a Stagecoach in Skye)
*Thurso (Janet Street) (t/a Stagecoach in Caithness)

There are various outstations over the division area due to the rural nature of the area covered. The operation from Aviemore depot comes under the East Scotland division as it trades as Stagecoach in Inverness.

=== Rail ===
ScotRail services connect Inverness railway station to Perth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Thurso, Wick, and Kyle of Lochalsh. Inverness is connected to London Euston by the &quot;Caledonian Sleeper&quot;, which departs six times a week, and by the London North Eastern Railway-operated &quot;Highland Chieftain&quot; to London King&#x27;s Cross, which runs daily. Inverness Airport station, opened in 2023, serves the city&#x27;s airport, and is served by services between Inverness and Aberdeen.

===Port of Inverness===
The Port of Inverness is located at the mouth of the River Ness. It has four quays and receives over 300 vessels a year.

===Air===

Inverness Airport is located northeast of the city and has scheduled flights to airports across the UK including London, Manchester, Belfast and the islands to the north and west of Scotland, as well as a number of flights to Europe. Loganair operate Saab 340 and Saab 2000 aircraft on routes to Benbecula, Dublin, Kirkwall, Stornoway, and Sumburgh. EasyJet operate Airbus aircraft to London Gatwick three times per day, Luton twice a day and Bristol. British Airways operates a daily service to London Heathrow, and KLM operate a daily service to Amsterdam.

==Government==
There are two tiers of local government covering Inverness. Most functions are provided by the Highland Council, which is based in the city. There is also a lower tier of community councils, with the urban area of Inverness straddling several communities.

===Administrative history===
From when it was made a royal burgh in the 12th century, Inverness was governed by the town council of the burgh until 1975. It was also the seat of the Sheriff of Inverness, who had responsibility for administering justice across Inverness-shire. When elected county councils were introduced in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, Inverness was considered large enough for its existing town council to provide county-level local government functions, and so it was excluded from the administrative area of Inverness-shire County Council.

Inverness was subsequently brought within the administrative area of the county council in 1930, but classed as a large burgh, allowing the town council to continue to provide most local government services.
The burgh of Inverness was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts and replaced them with a two-tier system of regions and districts. Inverness therefore became part of the larger Inverness district, which was one of eight districts within the Highland region. The Inverness district covered the area of the former burgh plus an extensive rural area around the city, being the area of the two former landward districts of Inverness (covering the rural area generally east of Loch Ness and Inverness itself) and Aird (covering the area generally west of Inverness and Loch Ness. Inverness District Council was based at Inverness Town House on the High Street in the centre of Inverness, which had been completed in 1882 for the old Inverness Town Council.

The districts and regions created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and replaced with single-tier council areas. The Highland region became one of the new council areas.

The Highland Council has a number of area committees for debating local matters. One of the committees is called the City of Inverness Area Committee, comprising the councillors who represent the wards which broadly correspond to the pre-1996 Inverness District. The area committee choses one of its members to take the title of Provost of Inverness.

===City status===
In 2001, city status was granted to the &quot;Town of Inverness&quot;, and letters patent were taken into the possession of the Highland Council by the convener of the Inverness area committee.

These letters patent, which were sealed in March 2001 and are held by Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, create a city of Inverness, but do not refer to any defined boundaries for the city. In January 2008 a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no legal body (such as a council) to which arms for Inverness can be granted.

===Parliamentary representation===

There are two existing parliamentary constituencies with &quot;Inverness&quot; as an element in their names:
* One county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster):
** Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire (first established in 2024 and replacing the previous Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, which existed between 2005 and 2019) currently represented by Angus MacDonald of the Scottish Liberal Democrats 
* One constituency of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood), created in 2011:
** Inverness and Nairn, currently represented by Scottish National Party Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) Fergus Ewing

These existing constituencies are effectively subdivisions of the Highland council area, but boundaries for Westminster elections are now very different from those for Holyrood elections. The Holyrood constituencies are also subdivisions of the Highlands and Islands electoral region.

Historically there have been six Westminster constituencies:
* One burgh constituency:
** Inverness Burghs, 1708 to 1918
* Five county constituencies:
** Inverness-shire, 1708 to 1918
** Inverness, 1918 to 1983
** Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, 1983 to 1997
** Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, 1997 to 2005
** Ross, Skye and Inverness West, 1997 to 2005

Inverness Burghs was a district of burghs constituency, covering the parliamentary burghs of Inverness, Fortrose, Forres, and Nairn. Inverness-shire covered, at least nominally, the county of Inverness minus the Inverness parliamentary burgh. As created in 1918, Inverness covered the county minus Outer Hebridean areas, which were merged into the Western Isles constituency. The Inverness constituency included the former parliamentary burgh of Inverness. As created in 1983, Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber was one of three constituencies covering the Highland region, which had been created in 1975. As first used in 1997, the Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, and Ross, Skye and Inverness West constituencies were effectively two of three constituencies covering the Highland unitary council area, which had been created in 1996.

==Culture==
===Twin towns – sister cities===

Inverness is twinned with:
*Augsburg, Germany (1956)
*La Baule-Escoublac, France (1981)
*Saint-Valery-en-Caux, France (1987)

===Arts and events ===
The main theatre, cinema and arts centre in Inverness is called Eden Court Theatre. Other venues in the city include Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, The Iron Works, The Northern Meeting Park and Wasp Studios. Inverness is an important centre for bagpipe players and lovers, since every September the city hosts the Northern Meeting. The Inverness cape, a garment worn in the rain by pipers the world over, is not necessarily made in Inverness.

Another major event in calendar is the annual City of Inverness Highland Games. The event can trace its roots back to one of the first Highland Games staged in the modern era; the True Highland Games which was staged in 1822 by members of the Northern Meeting Society. In 1864 the Northern Meeting Society built the world&#x27;s first Highland Games stadium, the Northern Meeting Park. The last Northern Meeting Highland Games was staged in 1938 and following the second world war, responsibility for the organisation of the annual event passed to the Town Council who moved the event to Bught Park in 1948. In 2006 Inverness hosted Scotland&#x27;s biggest ever Highland Games over two days in July, featuring the Masters&#x27; World Championships, the showcase event for heavies aged over 40 years. The first year that the Masters&#x27; World Championships had been held outside the United States was 2006, and it attracted many top heavies from around the world to the Inverness area. The Masters World Championships returned in 2009 when it was staged as part of the Homecoming celebrations. In 2010, the City of Inverness Highland Games returned to Northern Meeting Park where it remains to this day. Actress Karen Gillan is the ambassador for Theatre Art Education.

Inverness has gained notoriety as well for being featured in the &quot;Outlander&quot; novel series by author Diana Gabaldon. The Tartan Heart Festival in the nearby village of Kiltarlity, is a summer festival that brings a variety of music to the area. BFBS Radio broadcasts on 87.7FM as part of its UK Bases network.

Inverness Botanic Gardens is located in Bught Park a few minutes walk from the west bank of the River Ness near to the Ness Islands.

In 2007, the city hosted Highland 2007, a celebration of the culture of the Highlands, and will also host the World Highland Games Heavy Championships (21 &amp; 22 July) and European Pipe Band Championships (28 July). 2008 saw the first Hi-Ex (Highlands International Comics Expo), held at the Eden Court Theatre.

Inverness is the location of Macbeth&#x27;s castle in Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Inverness Library is located in Farraline Park, housed in what was originally the Bell&#x27;s school, designed by William Robertson in the Greek Revival style. The school was built with help from a £10,000 donation from Dr Andrew Bell in 1837.

===Media===
BBC Scotland has a studio in the city which broadcast the local opt-out of BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio nan Gàidheal.

Television signals are received from the Rosemarkie TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in the centre of the city.

The commercial radio station, &quot;Moray Firth Radio&quot; (MRF) is also based in the city located on Scorguie Place.

&quot;The Inverness Courier&quot; is the local weekly newspaper which publishes on Fridays.

===Language===

Historically, Inverness had a solidly Scottish Gaelic speaking population, with the majority of the population having Gaelic as their first language. From approximately the end of the 19th century, particularly following the 1872 Education Act, which made school attendance compulsory and required that only English be taught and tolerated in the schools on pain of corporal punishment, Inverness suffered a decline in the number of Gaelic speakers in line with the rest of the once Gaidhealtachd / Scottish Highlands. Despite the local dialect of Scottish Gaelic gradually falling out of use (although it continued to affect the local Highland English dialect), the language is still spoken locally in other dialects and the main standardised form. By the end of the 19th century, some rural areas to the south east of Inverness still had completely Gaelic-speaking populations, such as Strath Dearn where almost 100% of the population were still Gaelic speaking.

1677: Inverness was described as &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; Gaelic speaking by the traveller Thomas Kirk.

1704: Close to 100% of the population was fluent in Gaelic with over 75% of the population only able to speak Gaelic. Edward Lhuyd published major work on Inverness Gaelic and after collecting data from between 1699 and 1700, his findings showed a distinct dialect in the area. The clear dialect of Inverness Gaelic was held in high regard by speakers of other forms, such as those from Lewis, Sutherland and Ross. Gaelic remained the principal language of Invernessians for the rest of the 18th century, despite growing pressure from outwith the Highlands in both political and social contexts.

1798: Thomas Garnett (Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain) observed that Inverness had become largely bilingual with Invernessians using Gaelic as the language of the home but English as the language of foreign trade – however, the older generation at the time generally only had the Gaelic. Speaking of those in the countryside immediately surrounding Inverness, Garnett stated that although in Inverness both Gaelic and English &quot;are spoken promiscuously...the language of the country people is Gaelic.&quot;

1828: John Wood praised the standard of both the Gaelic and English spoken in Inverness stating that both languages were spoken with &quot;utmost purity.&quot; He noted that children would casually flit between the two languages while playing, asking questions in Gaelic while receiving answers in English and vice versa.

1882: &quot;The Celtic Magazine&quot;, published in Inverness, complained that enumerators of the 1881 census who assessed whether families were Gaelic speaking, English speaking or both, had supplied false information. The magazine wrote that &quot;whole families ... scarcely any member of whom can express the commonest idea intelligently in English – who are in every sense Gaelic-speaking people only – were returned by the enumerators as English-speaking.&quot;

1901: Inhabitants of Inverness voiced regret at the very swift decay of the native language in the short space of twenty years following a complete absence of bilingual education and disregard for Gaelic.

The number of Gaelic speakers has fluctuated over the last century. In 1881, the census reported 4,047 Gaelic speakers in Inverness (23.3% of the population) which by 1891 had risen to 6,356 speakers (30.47%). By 1901 this figure had dropped to 5,072 speakers (23.88%) of the population, from which it continued to drop to present day numbers through emigration and language shift. Scottish Gaelic is slowly re-appearing in the linguistic landscape, appearing on some signs around Inverness. Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis, which opened in August 2007 as a primary school of Scottish Gaelic-medium education, is nearing full capacity and was extended to allow for more pupils in August 2010. 

For a city of its size, Inverness today has a relatively high density of Gaelic speakers and a relatively lively Gaelic scene, making it one of the centres of the Scottish Gaelic Renaissance. According to the 2011 census, 4.8% of residents of greater Inverness over age 3 speak Gaelic compared to 1.1% nationally. At 2,800 Gaelic speakers, only Greater Glasgow and Edinburgh have a higher absolute total. Bòrd na Gàidhlig, an organisation responsible for supporting and promoting the use of Scottish Gaelic nationwide, has its main office in Inverness. Other Gaelic related groups include the Inverness Gaelic Choir which has existed for over 70 years. Inverness also hosted the Royal National Mòd in 2014, a festival, inspired by the Welsh Eisteddfod, celebrating Scottish Gaelic culture, literature, and music.

===Cityscape===

Important buildings in Inverness include Inverness Castle, and various churches. The castle was built in 1835 on the site of its medieval predecessor. Until 30 March 2020, it housed Inverness Sheriff Court: this has now been moved to the Inverness Justice Centre.

Inverness Cathedral, dedicated to St Andrew, is a cathedral of the Scottish Episcopal Church and seat of the ordinary of the Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness. The cathedral has a curiously square-topped look to its spires, as funds ran out before they could be completed.

The oldest church is the Old High Church, on St Michael&#x27;s Mount by the riverside, a site perhaps used for worship since Celtic times. The church tower dates from mediaeval times, making it the oldest surviving building in Inverness. It is used by the Church of Scotland congregation of Old High St Stephen&#x27;s, Inverness, and it is the venue for the annual Kirking of the council, which is attended by local councillors.

There is no Catholic cathedral in the area as the Diocesan cathedral (St Mary) is at Aberdeen. The Catholic population is served by two parish churches: St Mary&#x27;s, Inverness founded in 1837, is the older of the two and the first Catholic parish founded and built in Inverness after nearly three hundred years of religious persecution was ended by Catholic Emancipation in 1829. St Ninian&#x27;s was built during the 1960s and 1970s.

Porterfield Prison, officially HMP Inverness, serves the courts of the Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney Isles and Moray, providing secure custody for all remand prisoners and short-term adult prisoners, both male and female, who are segregated.

==Sports and leisure==
Inverness is connected to three long-distance footpaths:
* The Great Glen Way – connects to Fort William along the Great Glen
* The John o&#x27; Groats Trail – connects to John o&#x27; Groats along the coast
* The South Loch Ness Trail – connects to Fort Augustus along the southeast side of Loch Ness

Inverness has been home to many football clubs, mainly in the Highland League due to the inaccessibility to be promoted into the SFA Pyramid until 2013. Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel, Clachnacuddin, Caledonian and Inverness Thistle were all founder members of the Highland League in 1893, with Inverness Celtic joining in 1897 before disappearing a few years later. Inverness Union merged with Inverness Thistle in 1895, and Inverness Citadel folding in 1937, with the team name being revived at amateur level in 2010. In 1994, Caledonian and Inverness Thistle merged to form Caledonian Thistle, later Inverness Caledonian Thistle, to gain election into the Scottish Football League, before going on to gain promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2004, and winning the Scottish Cup and playing in the UEFA Europa League in 2015. After the cup win, the club went into a swift, but steady, decline, and eventually into Scottish League One and administration in 2024, despite this, they&#x27;ve proven themselves to be the dominant side in the highlands. Clachnacuddin remain in the Highland League, winning the league as recently as 2004. In 2006, Inverness City was founded, playing in the North Caledonian League and the North Region Junior Leagues until being folded in 2019. In 2016, the city&#x27;s third active, and ninth total, team, Inverness Athletic was founded and are currently playing in the North Caledonian League. In 2020, Loch Ness joined the North Caledonian League, making the step up from the Inverness and District League, before withdrawing in 2024. A fourth club is expected to join the active list, with a new Inverness Thistle being brought forward in hopes to join the North Caledonian League for the 2025–26 season.

Highland RFC is the local rugby union club that competes in the Scottish National League Division One. It has enjoyed recent promotions in the past several years and continues to be a hub for rugby in the North of Scotland.

Shinty is an integral part of the Highlands and Islands. As the capital of the Highlands, Camanachd Association is based in Inverness and the city often hosts a wealth of Shinty finals such as the Camanachd Cup Final (the pinnacle of Shinty) as well as the international game of Shinty and Irish hurling. Despite Inverness Shinty Club not being particularly successful in recent years, some of the towns and villages that surround the city have been, such as Kiltarlity who are the home of Lovat Shinty Club (recent winners of the MacTavish Cup 2013) and Glen Urquhart.

Highland HC is the local hockey team, it consists of two men&#x27;s teams, two ladies teams and a junior team. with both Men&#x27;s &amp; Ladies&#x27; 1st teams in Scottish National Division 2. The Men&#x27;s 1st team successfully gained promotion from Scottish National Division 3 in 2011.

Inverness Blitz is a charity that promotes the development of American football in Inverness and the surrounding area. Bught Park, located in the centre of Inverness is the finishing point of the annual Loch Ness Marathon and home of Inverness Shinty Club.

In 2011, Inverness hosted professional golf with the Scottish Open on the European Tour, played at Castle Stuart the week before The Open Championship. Cricket is also played in Inverness, with both Highland CC and Northern Counties playing in the North of Scotland Cricket Association League and 7 welfare league teams playing midweek cricket at Fraser Park. Both teams have been very successful over the years.

Stock car racing was staged in Inverness circa 1973. Inverness has a mixed basketball team, the Inverness Giants, who play exhibition games against local teams throughout the North and Islands.

<text>The Meteora (; , ) is a rock formation in the regional unit of Trikala, in Thessaly, in northwestern Greece, hosting one of the most prominent complexes of Eastern Orthodox monasteries, viewed locally as second in importance only to Mount Athos. Twenty-four monasteries were established atop the giant natural pillars and hill-like rounded boulders that dominate the local area, mainly from the second half of the 14th century under the local rule of Simeon Uroš. Six of these are still active and open to visitors: the monasteries of Great Meteoron (est. 1356), Varlaam, Saint Nicholas Anapausas, Rousanou, Holy Trinity, and Saint Stephen. The latter became a community of nuns in 1961, whereas the former five remain managed by monks.

Meteora is located in between the town of Kalabaka and the village of Kastraki at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the Pineios river and Pindus Mountains. The Meteora complex was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988 because of its outstanding architecture and beauty, combined with religious and cultural significance. 

The name means &quot;lofty&quot;, &quot;elevated&quot;, and is etymologically related to &quot;meteor&quot;.

==Geology==
Beside the Pindos Mountains, in the western region of Thessaly, these unique and enormous columns of rock rise precipitously from the ground. But their unusual form is not easy to explain geologically. They are not volcanic plugs of hard igneous rock typical elsewhere, but the rocks are composed of a mixture of sandstone and conglomerate.

The conglomerate was formed of deposits of stone, sand, and mud from streams flowing into a delta at the edge of a lake, over millions of years. About 60 million years ago during the Paleogene period a series of earth movements pushed the seabed upward, creating a high plateau and causing many vertical fault lines in the thick layer of sandstone. The huge rock pillars were then formed by weathering by water, wind, and extremes of temperature on the vertical faults. It is unusual that this conglomerate formation and type of weathering are confined to a relatively localised area within the surrounding mountain formation. The complex is referred to an exhumed continental remnant of Pangean association.

This type of rock formation and weathering process has happened in many other places locally and throughout the world, but what makes Meteora&#x27;s appearance special is the uniformity of the sedimentary rock constituents deposited over millions of years leaving few signs of vertical layering, and the localised abrupt vertical weathering.

Excavations and research have discovered petrified diatoms in Theopetra Cave, which have contributed to understanding the Palaeo-climate and climate changes. Radiocarbon dating evidences human presence dating back 50,000 years. The cave used to be open to the public, but is currently closed indefinitely, for safety inspections.

Vegetation grows thickly out of the vertical rock walls, mainly due to the water that one is able to find in the cracks and crevices that scale the cliff. Over the past several hundred years, the reports that the Meteora was easily accessible by foot have changed because now one must pass through an impenetrable jungle.

Being such massive unpredictable rock pillars, rock falls pose a constant threat to pilgrims and tourists of Meteora. An earthquake of magnitude 7 on the Richter Scale shook the rocks in 1954; miraculously the thin pillars still stand today. In 2005, a massive rock fell, closing the access road leading up to Meteora for days.

==History==
===Archaeology===

Theopetra Cave is located from Kalambaka. Its uniqueness from an archeological perspective is that a single site contains records of two greatly significant cultural transitions: the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans and later, the transition from hunting-gathering to farming after the end of the last Ice Age. The cave consists of an immense rectangular chamber at the foot of a limestone hill, which rises to the northeast above the village of Theopetra, with an entrance wide by high. It lies at the foot of the Chasia mountain range, which forms the natural boundary between Thessaly and Macedonia regions, while the Lithaios River, a tributary of the Pineios River, flows in front of the cave. The small Lithaios River flowing literally on the doorsteps of the cave meant that cave dwellers always had easy access to fresh, clean water without the need to cover daily long distances to find it.

===Ancient history===
Caves in the vicinity of Meteora were inhabited continuously between 50,000 and 5,000 years ago. The oldest known example of a built structure, a stone wall that blocked two-thirds of the entrance to the Theopetra cave, was constructed 23,000 years ago, probably as a barrier against cold winds (Earth was experiencing an ice age at the time), and many paleolithic and neolithic artifacts of human occupation have been found within the caves.

Meteora is not mentioned in classical Greek myths, nor in Ancient Greek literature. The first people who were documented to inhabit Meteora after the Neolithic Era were an ascetic group of hermit monks who, in the 800s CE, moved up to the ancient pinnacles. They lived in and fissures in the rock towers, some of them as high as 1800 ft (550m) above the plain. This great height, combined with the sheerness of the cliff walls, kept away all but the most determined visitors. Initially, the hermits led a life of solitude, meeting only on Sundays and special days, to worship and pray in a chapel built at the foot of a rock known as Dupiani.

As early as the eleventh century, monks occupied the caverns of Meteora. However, monasteries were not built there until the 1300s, when the monks sought somewhere to hide in the face of an increasing number of attacks by the Turks upon Greece. At this time, access to the top was via removable ladders or hoisting ropes. Currently, getting up there is much simpler, due to steps having been carved-into the rock during the 1920s. Of the 24 monasteries, only six (four of men, two of women) are still functioning, with each housing fewer than ten individuals.

===History and construction of the monasteries===
The exact date of the establishment of the monasteries is widely believed to be unknown. However, there are clues to when each of the monasteries was constructed. By the late eleventh century and early 1100s, a rudimentary monastic state had formed, called the Skete of Stagoi, and it was centerd around the still-standing church of Theotokos (Mother of God). By the end of the 1100s, an ascetic community had flocked to Meteora.

In 1344, Athanasios Koinovitis from Mount Athos, later known as Athanasios the Meteorite, brought a group of followers to Meteora. From 1356 to 1372, he founded The Monastery of Great Meteoron on the Broad Rock. That location was perfect for the monks, because there, they were safe from political upheaval, and they had complete control of the entry to the monastery. The only means of reaching it was by climbing a long ladder, which was drawn-up whenever the monks thought that there was a threat to them. The creation of the monastic community at Meteora was protected and sponsored by the local lord Simeon Uroš, based in nearby Trikala, who in 1356 had proclaimed himself Emperor of Serbs and Greeks following the death of Stefan Dušan. 

Simeon Uros was succeeded in 1370 by his son John Uroš, who three years later retired as a monk to the Meteoron monastery and died there in the early 1420s. At the end of the fourteenth century, Christian rule over northern Greece was being increasingly threatened by Turkish raiders who wanted control over the fertile plain of Thessaly, which they finally secured in the second half of the 15th century. The hermit monks, seeking a retreat from the expanding Ottoman empire, found the inaccessible rock pillars of Meteora to be an ideal refuge. More than 20 monasteries were built, of which six remain today. In 1517, Theophanes built the monastery of Varlaam, which was reputed to house the finger of St. John and the shoulder blade of St. Andrew.

Access to the monasteries was originally (and deliberately) difficult, requiring either long ladders that were latched together, or large nets that were used to haul-up both goods and people. This required quite a leap of faith, because the ropes were replaced, so the story goes, only &quot;when the Lord let them break&quot;. In the words of UNESCO: &quot;The net in which intrepid pilgrims were hoisted up vertically alongside the cliff where the Varlaam monastery dominates the valley symbolizes the fragility of a traditional way of life that is threatened with extinction.&quot;

Until the 1600s, the primary means of conveying goods and people from these high places was by means of baskets and ropes.

Under the Convention of Constantinople (1881), Thessaly was taken-over by the Kingdom of Greece. In 1921, Queen Marie of Romania visited Meteora, becoming the first woman ever allowed to enter the Great Meteoron monastery.

In the 1920s, there was an improvement in the arrangements: Steps were cut into the rock, making the complex accessible via a bridge from the nearby plateau. During World War II, the site was bombed.

The greater Meteora rock formation also extends northwest into the Gavros and Agios Dimitrios areas, although the term &quot;Meteora&quot; is commonly used to refer to only the rocks around Kalabaka and Kastraki.

==The Monasteries of Meteora==
At their peak in the 16th century, there were 24 monasteries at Meteora in Greece. They were created to serve monks and nuns following the teachings of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Much of the architecture of these buildings is Athonite in origin. Today there are six still functioning, while the remainder are largely in ruin. Perched onto high cliffs, they are now accessible by staircases and pathways cut into the rock formations.

=== List of monasteries ===
Traditionally, the 24 historic monasteries of Meteora are listed as follows. Coordinates are also given for some sites. The list is primarily sourced from Vlioras (2017), with some additional notes from Provatakis (2006).

Other sites (sketes, hermitages, rocks, etc.) include:

=== The Great Meteoron ===


The Holy Monastery of Great Meteoron is the oldest and largest of the monasteries of Meteora. The monastery is believed to have been built just before the mid 14th century by a monk from Mount Athos named Saint Athanasios the Meteorite. He began the build with a church in dedication to the Mother of God, the Virgin Mary. He later added small cells so that monks could concentrate and live atop the rock formations. The monastery&#x27;s second name is, The Holy Monastery of the Transfiguration, which got its name from the second church St. Meteorites built. The successor of Saint Athanasios was Saint Joasaph, who continued to build more cells, a hospital, and renovated the churches atop the rocks. The Monastery thrived in the 16th century when it received many imperial and royal donations. At the time it had over three hundred monks living and worshipping within its cells. It is still a living monastery as there were three monks in residence as of 2015.

Being the largest among all the monasteries allows it to have a particular layout filled with many buildings. The katholikon is dedicated to the Transfiguration of Jesus and was the first church of the monastery. The hermitage of the first founder of the monastery is a small building carved in rock. The kitchen or what is commonly referred to as the hestia is a dome-shaped building near the refectory. There is also a hospital, with its famous roof of the ground floor made of brick and supported on four columns. The three old churches or chapels include: The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist which lies next to the katholikon sanctuary, The Saints Constantine and Helen Chapel which is an aisle-less church with large vault, and finally the chapel of Virgin Mary situated in the cave.

=== Monastery of Varlaam ===
The Monastery of Varlaam is the second largest monastery of Meteora. The name Varlaam comes from a monk named Varlaam who scaled the rocks in 1350 and began construction on the monasteries. Varlaam built three churches by hoisting materials up the face of the cliffs. After Varlaam&#x27;s death, the monastery was abandoned for two hundred years until two monk brothers, Theophanes and Nektarios Apsarades, came to the rock in the 16th century and began to rebuild the churches in October 1517. The two brothers from Ioannina spent twenty-two years hoisting materials to the top of the rock formation, however, the building only is reported to have taken around twenty days. Monks have been present since the 16th century, however, there has been a constant decline in their presence since the 17th century. Today the monastery is accessed through a series of ladders that scale the north side of the rock. The museum is open to travelers and contains a wide array of relics and ecclesiastical treasures. there are seven monks remaining in Varlaam.

=== Monastery of Rousanou ===
The Monastery of Rousanou is believed to have been constructed, like many of the other monasteries, in the 14th century. The cathedral is believed to have been built in the 16th century and later decorated in 1540. The name Rousanou is believed to come from the first group of monks who settled on the rock from Russia. The monastery sits on the elevation 484 meters. Lying in the middle of the site, visitors can see the other monasteries, as well as the ruins of the Monastery of St. John the Baptist and the Pantokrator.

=== Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas ===
The Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas is located atop a small narrow rock. It is approximately eighty meters high and the first which the pilgrims encounter on their way to the holy Meteora. The Monastery was founded in the late 14th century and today is surrounded by the deserted and ruined monasteries of St. John Prodromos, the Pantocrator, and the chapel of Panagia Doupiani. The monastery served as a resting place for pilgrims and quickly got its name of &quot;Anapausas&quot; (modern pronunciation &quot;anapafseos&quot;), &#x27;resting&#x27;. Being on such a narrow surface, the floors are connected through an interior staircase. St. Nicholas is honored on the second floor where the katholikon is located. On the third floor, there is the Holy Table and the walls are decorated by 14th-century frescoes. The monastery has been restored in the 16th century and again in the 1960s.

=== Monastery of the Holy Trinity ===
The Monastery of the Holy Trinity is believed to have been built in the 14th and 15th century. Even prior to this, ancient Greeks established hermitages at the base of the rock cliffs. In the 14th century, John Uroš moved to the Meteora and endowed and built monasteries on top of the rock cliffs. He offered the sanctuaries as a safe haven during times of political upheaval. The monk Dometius was said to be the founder of the monastery, arriving at the site of Holy Trinity in 1438. The actual monastery is believed to have been built between 1475 and 1476. Some do say that the exact construction date of the monastery like many of the other monasteries is unknown. By the end of the 16th century this was one of the last six monasteries still atop the Meteora.

=== Monastery of St. Stephen ===

The Monastery of St. Stephen is located on a plateau-like structure. The original monastery was believed to have been built in the 14th century, however, a new katholikon was built in 1798 making it the newest of all the meteorite structures. The monastery is made up of many buildings including new katholikon, the &quot;hestia&quot; (kitchen), an old refectory that has since become a museum, and an assortment of rooms with different purposes. These include workrooms for paintings, embroidery, incense-making, and needlework. The church&#x27;s interior was decorated with frescoes on the inside for a short period after 1545. However, During the World wars, the monasteries were bombed heavily and ransacked in the belief that the monks were holding refugees. , the Monastery of St. Stephen is home to 28 nuns after its conversion to a nunnery in 1961.

<text>Augustinians are members of several religious orders that follow the Rule of Saint Augustine, written in about 400 AD by Augustine of Hippo. There are two distinct types of Augustinians in Catholic religious orders dating back to the 12th–13th centuries:
* Various congregations of Canons Regular also follow the Rule of Saint Augustine, embrace the evangelical counsels and lead a semi-monastic life, while remaining committed to pastoral care appropriate to their primary vocation as priests. They generally form one large community which might serve parishes in the vicinity, and are organized into autonomous congregations.
* Several orders of friars who live a mixed religious life of contemplation and apostolic ministry. The largest and most familiar is the Order of Saint Augustine (OSA), founded in 1244 and originally known as the Hermits of Saint Augustine (OESA). They are commonly known as the Austin Friars in England. Two other orders, the Order of Augustinian Recollects and the Discalced Augustinians, were once part of the OSA under a single prior general. The Recollects, founded in 1588 as a reform movement in Spain, became autonomous in 1612. The Discalceds became an independent congregation in 1592, and were raised to the status of a separate mendicant order in 1610.

There are also some Anglican religious orders created in the 19th century that follow Augustine&#x27;s rule. These are composed only of women in several different communities of Augustinian nuns.

==Charism==
In a religious community, &quot;charism&quot; is the particular contribution that each religious order, congregation or family and its individual members embody. The teaching and writing of Augustine, the &quot;Augustinian Rule&quot;, and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over sixteen centuries help define the ethos and special charism of the order.

The pursuit of truth through learning is key to the Augustinian ethos, balanced by the injunction to behave with love towards one another. These same imperatives of affection and fairness have driven the order in its international missionary outreach. This balanced pursuit of love and learning has energised the various branches of the order into building communities founded on mutual affection and intellectual advancement.

Augustine spoke passionately of God&#x27;s &quot;beauty so ancient and so new&quot;, and his fascination with beauty extended to music. He taught that &quot;whoever sings prays twice&quot; (&quot;Qui cantat, bis orat&quot;) and music is also a key part of the Augustinian ethos. Contemporary Augustinian musical foundations include the Augustinerkirche in Vienna, where orchestral masses by Mozart and Schubert are performed every week, as well as the boys&#x27; choir at Sankt Florian in Austria, a school conducted by Augustinian canons, a choir now over 1,000 years old.

Augustinians have also produced a formidable body of scholarly works.

==Background==
Augustinian friars believe that Augustine of Hippo, first with some friends and afterward as bishop with his clergy, led a monastic community life. Regarding the use of property or possessions, Augustine did not make a virtue of poverty, but of sharing. Their manner of life led others to imitate them. Instructions for their guidance were found in several writings of Augustine, especially in &quot;De opere monachorum&quot;, mentioned in ancient codices of the eighth or ninth century as the &quot;Rule of St. Augustine&quot;. Between 430 and 570 this life-style was carried to Europe by monks and clergy fleeing the persecution of the Vandals. In the thirteenth century, the various eremitical groups that composed the Augustinian Hermits faced the threat of suppression by the papacy based on their lack of antiquity. To overcome this, the friars forged a historical connection to St Augustine, and made an especial point to demonstrate that they received the Rule directly from Augustine himself. The Augustinian rule was in use by a wide range of groups across early and high medieval Europe, and there is no historical evidence that the Augustinian Friars were in any way founded by St Augustine himself. Rather, the friars invented these links after the Order was threatened with suppression in 1274 at the Second Council of Lyons.

While in early medieval times the rule was overshadowed by other Rules, particularly that of St. Benedict, this system of life for cathedral clergy continued in various locations throughout Europe for centuries, and they became known as Canons regular (i.e. cathedral clergy living in community according to a rule). Augustine&#x27;s Rule appears again in practice in the eleventh century as a basis for the reform of monasteries and cathedral chapters.

Several groups of canons were established under various disciplines, all with the Augustinian Rule as their basis. It was adopted by the Canons Regular of the Abbey of St. Victor in Paris, as well as the Norbertines. The instructions contained in Augustine&#x27;s Rule formed the basis of the Rule that, in accordance with the decree of the Lateran Synod of 1059, was adopted by canons who desired to practice a common apostolic life, hence the title of Canons Regular of Saint Augustine.

==Orders, groups, and societies==

===Canons Regular===
The Canons Regular follow the more ancient form of religious life which developed toward the end of the first millennium and thus predates the founding of the friars. They represent a clerical adaptation of monastic life, as it grew out of an attempt to organize communities of clerics to a more dedicated way of life, as St. Augustine himself had done. Historically it paralleled the lay movement of monasticism or the eremitical life from which the friars were later to develop. In their tradition, the canons added the commitment of religious vows to their primary vocation of pastoral care. As the canons became independent of the diocesan structures, they came to form their own monastic communities. The official name of the Order is the Canons Regular of St. Augustine (CRSA).

===Augustinian Friars===

The 2008 Constitutions of the Order of St. Augustine states that the Order of Saint Augustine is composed of the following:
:a) friars, whether professed or novices, who are members of the various Circumscriptions of the Order (meaning a Province, Vicariate, or Delegation).
:b) the contemplative nuns belonging to the monasteries of the order.
:c) the members of the Augustinian Secular Fraternities, legitimately established by the Prior General.

In addition to these three branches, the Augustinian family also includes other groups:
a) religious institutes, both male and female, formally aggregated to the order by a decree of the Prior General (this would include the Augustinians of the Assumption, the Sisters of St. Rita, etc.); b) other groups of lay Augustinians; c) lay faithful affiliated to the Order.

The Augustinian, or Austin, friars (OSA), are a mendicant order. As consecrated religious, they pray the Liturgy of the Hours throughout the day. This Latin Church order, while a contemplative Order, differs from traditional monastic orders in three ways. 1) They do not take vows of stability, meaning that they can live in one house (called a friary or sometimes a monastery) typically for several years before being moved into a different community of the order. 2) They are engaged in apostolic activity, such as mission work, education, prison ministries, etc. The order is under the supervision of a Prior General in Rome, and as an international order they are divided into various Provinces throughout the world, with each Province being led by a Prior Provincial. (3) As an order, they have a special commitment to corporate poverty as opposed to simply the poverty professed by the individual friar. While this is not currently legislated as it was in the origins of the order, this is to be a distinguishing mark of their lives as a community.

As consecrated religious, Augustinians profess the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience. They follow the Rule of St. Augustine, written sometime between 397 and 403 for a monastic community Augustine founded in Hippo (in modern day Algeria), and which takes as its inspiration the early Christian community described in the Acts of the Apostles, particularly Acts 4:32: &quot;The community of believers was of one heart and mind, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they had everything in common.&quot; (NAB).

By decree of the Holy See, the Augustinian Order was historically granted what was known as exempt status, which placed made it directly dependent on the Pope, meaning that bishops had no jurisdiction with regards to the internal affairs of the order. This is now expressed by saying that the order is an institute of pontifical right.

====History of the Friars====
The Augustinian friars originated after the older Canons Regular. The friars represented part of the mendicant movement of the 13th century, a new form of religious life which sought to bring the religious ideals of monastic life into an urban setting which allowed the religious to serve the needs of the people in an apostolic capacity. At this time a number of eremitical groups lived in such diverse places as Tuscany, Latium, Umbria, Liguria, England, Switzerland, Germany, and France. The Fourth Council of the Lateran of 1215 issued the decree &quot;Ne nimium&quot; to organise these small groups of religious people by requiring them to live in community, to hold elective chapters, to be under obedience to a major superior and to adopt one of the Rules of community life that were approved by the Church.

=====Little Union=====
In 1243 the Tuscan hermits petitioned Pope Innocent IV to unite them all as one group. On 16 December 1243 Innocent IV issued the bull &quot;Incumbit Nobis&quot;, an essentially pastoral letter which, despite its brevity, basically served as the &quot;magna carta&quot; initiating the foundation of the Order as it is known today. This papal bull exhorted these hermits to adopt the &quot;Rule&quot; and way of life of Augustine of Hippo, to profess this Augustinian manner of life in a way that they themselves would decide with regards to their specific charism and apostolate, and to elect a Prior General. The bull also appointed Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi as their Cardinal protector. The importance of this man in the foundation of the Order cannot be overstated.

As decreed by the bull &quot;Praesentium Vobis&quot;, the Tuscan hermits came together for a general chapter in March 1244, a chapter presided over by Cardinal Annibaldi. At this chapter the Order formally adopted the Rule of St. Augustine and determined to follow the Roman office with the Cistercian psalter, and to hold triennial elections of the Prior General. The first Prior General was Friar Matthew, followed by Adjutus and Philip. In the papal bull &quot;Pia desideria&quot;, issued on 31 March 1244, Pope Innocent IV formally approved the foundation of the Order.

=====Grand Union of 1256=====
In 1255 Innocent&#x27;s successor, Pope Alexander IV, issued the papal bull &quot;Cum Quaedam Salubria&quot; summoning all the various groups of Augustinian hermits and the Hermits of Saint William to send two representatives to Rome for a General Chapter, again to be held under the supervision of his nephew, Cardinal Annibaldi. During this chapter the following groups of hermits, &quot;inter alia&quot;, were amalgamated to the Order, which up to then had only consisted of the groups of the Tuscan hermits (including the Hermits of the Holy Trinity):

* the Hermits of Saint William
* the Brittin (named after St. Blasius de Brittinis)
* the Bonites (named after St. John the Good) The Fratres Saccati in Italy, and some of the houses of the Poor Catholics united with the Bonites. By 1256 the Bonites possessed eleven monasteries.

At this Chapter Lanfranc Settala, the leader of the Bonites, was elected Prior General. The belted, black tunic of the Tuscan hermits was adopted as the common religious habit, and the walking sticks carried by the Bonites in keeping with eremitical tradition—and to distinguish themselves from those hermits who went around begging—ceased to be used. The 12-year-old religious Order of friars now consisted of 100 or more houses.

On 9 April 1256 Pope Alexander IV issued the bull &quot;Licet Ecclesiae catholicae&quot; (Bullarium Taurinense, 3rd ed., 635 sq.) which confirmed the integration of the Hermits of John the Good (Rule of St. Augustine, 1225), the Hermits of St. William (Rule of St. Benedict), the Hermits of Brettino (Rule of St. Augustine, 1228), the Hermits of Monte Favale (Rule of St. Benedict), other smaller congregations, and the Tuscan Hermits into what was officially called the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine. Almost from the beginning the term &quot;hermits&quot; became a misnomer for they ranked among the friars, and became the fourth of the mendicant orders. The observance and manner of life was mild relative to those times, meat being allowed four days in the week.

In August 1256, a number of Williamite houses withdrew from the newly formed mendicant order and were allowed to continue as a separate congregation under the Benedictine rule.

The early years in the order&#x27;s history featured a great devotion to learning, to study, to prayer, to service of the poor, and to defense of the Pope and the Church – a particular charism of the Order rooted in the fact that it is the only Order in the history of the Church to be founded directly by a Pope. In his work &quot;The Life of the Brothers&quot;, the 14th-century Augustinian historian and friar Jordan of Saxony writes:&quot;It is certain that in its modern state the Order is principally founded on spiritual works, those that pertain to the contemplative life. These are as follows: the singing of the divine office; the service of the altar; prayer; psalm singing; devotion to reading or study of sacred scripture; teaching and preaching the word of God; hearing confessions of the faithful; bringing about the salvation of souls by word and example.&quot;.

The Order expanded beyond Europe to the eastern Mediterranean, briefly acquiring a convent in Acre just prior to its conquest in 1291. In the middle of the fourteenth century, the Augustinian Friars acquired the large convent of San Salvatore in Venetian Heraklion (medieval Candia) where they attempted to use the cult of Nicholas of Tolentino to appeal to the local Greek-speaking population. The building stood on Kornaros Square until its demolition in 1970.

The Augustinians count among their number over a dozen saints and numerous members declared blessed by the Church. The Prior General Sebastiano Martinelli was the latest member of the order to be elevated to the cardinalate from 1901 to 1912.

====Privileges of the order====
Ecclesiastical privileges were granted to the order almost from its beginning. Alexander IV freed the order from the jurisdiction of the bishops; Innocent VIII, in 1490, granted to the churches of the order indulgences such as can only be gained by making the Stations at Rome; Pope Pius V placed the Augustinians among the mendicant orders and ranked them next to the Carmelites. Since the end of the 13th century the sacristan of the Papal Palace was always to be an Augustinian friar, who would be ordained as a bishop. This privilege was ratified by Pope Alexander VI and granted to the Order forever by a Bull issued in 1497. The holder of the office was Rector of the Vatican parish (of which the chapel of St. Paul is the parish church). To his office also belonged the duty of preserving in his oratory a consecrated Host, which had to be renewed weekly and kept in readiness in case of the pope&#x27;s illness, when it was the privilege of the papal sacristan to administer the last sacraments to the pope. The sacristan had always to accompany the pope when he traveled, and during a conclave it was he who celebrated Mass and administered the sacraments. He lived at the Vatican with a sub-sacristan and three lay brothers of the order (cf. Rocca, &quot;Chronhistoria de Apostolico Sacrario&quot;, Rome, 1605). Augustinian friars, as of 2009, still perform the duties of papal sacristans, but the appointment of an Augustinian bishop-sacristan lapsed under Pope John Paul II with the retirement of Petrus Canisius Van Lierde in 1991. In papal Rome the Augustinian friars always filled one of the Chairs of the Sapienza University, and one of the consultorships in the Congregation of Rites.

====Discalced and Recollect friars====

The Discalced Augustinians were formed in 1588 in Italy as a reform movement of the Order and have their own constitutions, differing from those of the other Augustinians. The Augustinian Recollects developed in Spain in 1592 with the same goal. Currently, though, they are primarily found serving in pastoral care.

====Organization of the order====
The Augustinian Hermits, while following the rule known as that of St. Augustine, are also subject to the Constitutions, first drawn up by Augustinus Novellus (d. 1309), Prior General of the order from 1298 to 1300, and by Clement of Osimo. A revision was made at Rome in 1895. The Constitutions were revised again and published at Rome in 1895, with additions in 1901 and 1907. Today, the Order follows the Constitutions approved in the Ordinary General Chapter of 2007.

The government of the order is as follows: At the head is the Prior General, elected every six years by the General Chapter. The Prior General is aided by six assistants and a secretary, also elected by the General Chapter. These form the &quot;Curia Generalitia&quot;. Each province is governed by a Prior Provincial, each commissariat by a Commissary General, each of the two congregations by a Vicar General, and every monastery by a Prior (only the Czech monastery of Alt-Brunn in Moravia is under an abbot) and every college by a Rector. The members of the Order number both priests and lay brothers. The Augustinians, like most religious orders, have a Cardinal Protector.

The Augustinians follow the rule of St. Augustine which is divided into 8 chapters (purpose and basis of common life, prayer, moderation and self-denial, safeguarding chastity and fraternal correction, the care of community goods and treatment of sick, asking for pardon and forgiving others, governance and obedience, and observance of the rule). The Augustinians also use the charism or &quot;gift from the Holy Spirit&quot; to guide the communal life.

The choir and outdoor dress of the friars is a tunic of black woolen material, with long, wide sleeves, a black leather girdle, and a large shoulder cape to which is attached a long, pointed hood reaching to the girdle. The indoor dress consists of a black tunic and scapular, over which the shoulder cape is worn. In many monasteries, white was formerly the color worn in areas where there were no Dominicans. In hot climates Augustinians tend to wear white habits as they are easily distinguishable with the Dominicans (i.e. without long scapular, rosary, etc.).

==== Charism of the Order of St. Augustine ====
&quot;The foundation of Augustinian life is life in common,&quot; with a contemplative dimension.

===Aggregated communities===
Other orders and groups belong within the Augustinian family either because they follow the Rule of Augustine, exist as independent societies, or have been formally aggregated through their constitutions into the worldwide Augustinian Order. These are not counted comprehensively in this article only because the Catholic Church&#x27;s system of governance and accounting makes just the numbers of ordained clerics relatively accessible and verifiable. Some of these include:
* The Hieronymites, the Ursulines, the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus, Augustinians of the Assumption (which includes a Byzantine Rite province), the Alexian Brothers, the Brothers of the Assumption (in the Congo), the Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation and San Guillermo Parish Church (which was buried half its 12-m height on September 3, 1994, due to the lahar slopes of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines), the Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word (who established the University of the Incarnate Word in Texas), the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God, and the Augustinians of the Assumption.

===Augustinian lay societies===
The lay societies are voluntary groups, generally made up of people who are either married or single and have sympathy with, and interest in, the Augustinian approach to life. These lay people do not take monastic vows, but offer support to the work of the Augustinian Order in voluntary work, gifts of money and goods, and of study and promotion of St. Augustine and Augustinian teaching.

The primary among these are the Third Orders associated with the various branches of the mendicant Orders. These are the Augustinian Lay Community and the Secular Augustinian Recollects. They make a formal and public commitment as laity to follow as best as possible the life and charism of the Order.

Other associations which support the spirit and work of the friars and Sisters include: the Brotherhood of the Virgin Mary of the Belt in Italy, the Friends of Augustine in the Philippines, and the Augustinian Friends in Australia.

==Devotional practices==

The particular devotional practices connected with the Augustinian Order, and which it has striven to propagate, include the veneration of the Blessed Virgin under the title of &quot;Mother of Good Counsel&quot; (Mater Boni Consilii), whose miraculous picture is to be seen in the Augustinian church at Genazzano in the Roman province. This devotion has spread to other churches and countries, and confraternities have been formed to encourage it. Several periodicals dedicated to the honour of Our Lady of Good Counsel are published in Italy, Spain and Germany by the Augustinians. The Augustinians, with the approbation of Pope Leo XIII, also encourage the devotion of the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel.
Besides this devotion, the order traditionally fostered the Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation. Members customarily wear a blessed sash or belt leather in honour of Saints Augustine, Monica and Nicholas of Tolentino, recite daily thirteen Our Fathers and Hail Marys and the Salve Regina, fast strictly on the eve of the feast of St. Augustine, and received Holy Communion on the feasts of the three above-named saints. This confraternity was founded by Pope Eugene IV at San Giacomo, Bologna, in 1439, made an archconfraternity by Gregory XIII, in 1575, aggregated to the Augustinian Order.

There are also a number of facilities dedicated to Mary under the title Our Lady of Grace. The Canadian Augustinians operate the Marylake Shrine of Our Lady of Grace at King City, Ontario; Our Lady of Grace Monastery is located in Nova Scotia.

<text>The English Football League Cup, often referred to as the League Cup and currently known as the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons, is an annual knockout competition in men&#x27;s domestic football in England. Organised by the English Football League (EFL), it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system—92 clubs in total—comprising the top-level Premier League, and the three divisions of the English Football League&#x27;s own league competition (Championship, League One and League Two).

First held in 1960–61 as the Football League Cup, it is one of the three top-tier domestic football competitions in England alongside the Premier League and FA Cup. It concludes in late-February, long before the other two major competitions, which end in May. It was introduced by the league as a response to the increasing popularity of European football, and to also exert power over the FA. It also took advantage of the roll-out of floodlights, allowing the fixtures to be played as midweek evening games. With the renaming of the Football League as the English Football League in 2016, the tournament was rebranded as the EFL Cup from the 2016–17 season onwards.

The tournament is played over seven rounds, with single-leg ties throughout, except for the semi-finals. The final is held at Wembley Stadium, which is the only leg in the competition played at a neutral venue and on a weekend (Sunday). The first two rounds are split into North and South sections, and a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds and defers the entry of teams still involved in Europe. Winners not only receive the EFL Cup, of which there have been three designs, the current one also being the original, but also qualify for European football: from 1966–67 until 1971–72 the winners received a place in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, from 1972–1973 until the 2019–20 season in the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) and starting with the 2020–21 season in the UEFA Conference League. Should the winner also qualify for Europe through other means at the end of the season, this place is transferred to the highest-placed Premier League team that has not already qualified for European competition. The most successful club in the competition are current holders Liverpool, who defeated Chelsea 1–0 in the 2024 final to win their tenth League Cup.

==Status==
Although the League Cup is one of the four domestic trophies attainable by English league teams, it is regarded as of lower prestige than the league title or the FA Cup. League Cup winners receive £100,000 prize money (awarded by the Football League) with the runners-up receiving £50,000, considered relatively insignificant to top-flight teams, compared to the £2 million prize money of the FA Cup, which is in turn eclipsed by the Premier League&#x27;s television money (awarded on final league position) and consequent participation in the Champions League.

Some clubs have repeatedly fielded a weaker side in the competition, making the opportunity for giant-killing of the larger clubs more likely. Many teams in the Premier League, Arsenal and Manchester United in particular, have used the competition to give young players valuable big-game experience. Consequently, it began to be described sarcastically by many fans as the &quot;Mickey Mouse cup&quot;.

However, in 2010, in response to Arsène Wenger&#x27;s claim that a League Cup win would not end his trophy drought, Alex Ferguson described the trophy as worth winning. After a period of decline when the competition&#x27;s future was regularly questioned, recent years have seen a revival in respect for the trophy, as the larger Premier League clubs have come to dominate the competition again, and the development nature of the competition has begun to be viewed as a positive for the clubs involved. Premier League giants Manchester City (6), Manchester United (5), Liverpool (5) and Chelsea (3) between them won 19 editions of the tournament between 2001 and 2024.
==History==

The original idea for a League Cup came from Stanley Rous, who saw the competition as a consolation for clubs who had already been knocked out of the FA Cup. However, it was not Rous who came to implement it, but Football League Secretary Alan Hardaker. Hardaker initially proposed the competition as a way for the clubs to make up for lost revenue due to a reduction in matches played, for when the league was to be reorganised. The reorganisation of the league was not immediately forthcoming; however, the cup competition was introduced regardless.

The trophy was paid for personally by Football League President Joe Richards, who was proud of the competition, and he had his own name engraved on it. Richards described the competition&#x27;s formation as an &quot;interim step&quot; on the way to the league&#x27;s re-organisation. Richards&#x27; priority was the reorganisation of the leagues, &quot;perhaps by cutting down the number of clubs in each division, as has already been suggested, and even given more consideration to the system of four up and four down&quot;.

Hardaker felt that the Football League needed to adapt to the times, as the English game was losing prestige. He felt that the Football League should take the lead in revitalising football in the nation: &quot;It must be obvious to all of you that the time has come to do something, and it is up to the Football League to give the lead. I hope the Press will not immediately assume that the League is going to fall out with the F.A. or anybody else... the time has come for our voice to be heard in every problem which affects the professional game.&quot;

The League Cup competition was established at a time when match-day attendances were dwindling. The league had lost a million spectators compared to the previous season. It was established at a time when tensions between the Football League and The Football Association were high. The biggest disagreement was about how revenue was shared between the clubs.

During the late 1950s, the majority of senior English clubs equipped their grounds with floodlights. This opened up the opportunity to exploit weekday evenings throughout the winter. The League Cup was introduced in the 1960–61 season specifically as a mid-week floodlit tournament to replace the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup.

The League Cup was criticised by the better-endowed clubs. &quot;The Times&quot;″ correspondent at the time felt that the League Cup was a step in the wrong direction; the European Cup had been formed five years prior to the League Cup and the correspondent felt the League Cup&#x27;s introduction was adding to existing problems. &quot;The Times&quot; published on 30 May 1960: &quot;Where a drastic reduction is required in an attempt to raise quality, no doubt quantity and a further spread of mediocrity will be the dose. Where men like Count Bernabeu with his wider horizons, think in terms of a European League for the future in which a lead could surely now be given jointly by our leaders, the Football League propose next season to implement their useless Football League Cup to be played in midweek. It gets the players, the clubs and the public nowhere.&quot;

Aston Villa were the inaugural winners in 1960–61, defeating Rotherham United 3–2 in the final over two legs. Football in England was considered to be of a low quality, compared to what was being played on the continent, as relatively unfashionable clubs Burnley and Wolverhampton Wanderers were England&#x27;s representatives in Europe that year, having lifted the major honours ahead of much bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United. Richards referred to the appetite for European football as &#x27;continental fever&#x27;. He was keen for the league to re-establish itself: &#x27;We must be prepared to put the interests of the League and the game before individual clubs.&#x27; Sixteen clubs opposed the competition&#x27;s creation, thirty-one approved it. The average attendance across the League Cup was 10,556, just higher than the average gate in the Third Division. The total attendance of the Football League competition had fallen by 4 million from the previous season. Richards is reputed to have told Hardaker that he foresaw &#x27;the League Cup final being held at Wembley, but that it wouldn&#x27;t be during his lifetime&#x27;. The first League Cup final to be held at Wembley was Third Division Queens Park Rangers&#x27; win over First Division West Bromwich Albion on 4 March 1967. Richards died in 1968.

The first League Cup was won in 1960–61 by Aston Villa who, at the time, held the overall record for major trophies won in England. The next three finals, however, saw the trophy won by clubs who had never won a major trophy before. One of them, Norwich City, had yet to even play in the First Division, while their opponents Rochdale had played no higher than the Third Division.

The introduction of the League Cup gave the Football League more negotiating power with the FA and UEFA. Hardaker threatened UEFA with a boycott of the UEFA Cup, unless UEFA gave the League Cup winner European qualification. As a result of the negotiating tactics, UEFA provided the League Cup winner with a place in the European competitions, providing the team was in the first division. Tottenham Hotspur were the first team to qualify for Europe by virtue of winning the competition. Although Leeds United had won the competition before Tottenham, Leeds qualified for Europe based on league position. The winners of the 1966–67 and 1968–69 editions, Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers and Swindon Town did not participate in Europe, as they were not in the First Division.

Prior to the agreement with UEFA, the competition was not considered worthy of the larger clubs&#x27; attention. However, once a position in Europe was on offer, as was a final at Wembley Stadium, the competition&#x27;s standing was improved and in the 1968–69 season only Manchester United declined to participate. Everton chose not to compete in 1970–71 so that they could concentrate their efforts on the European Cup. Entry was made compulsory for all Football League teams the following year.

Liverpool have won the cup on the most occasions with ten victories, and both they and Manchester City have won four League Cups in successive years. Liverpool completed two trebles of trophy wins, in 1983–84 and 2000–01, winning the League Cup in both of these years.

English clubs lost their place in European competitions for an indefinite period in 1985 as a result of the Heysel disaster, where Liverpool fans had taken part in a riot at the European Cup final, resulting in the death of 39 spectators. That year&#x27;s winners of the League Cup were Norwich City, who would otherwise have played in a European competition for the first time in the 1985–86 season. Oxford United, Arsenal, Luton Town and Nottingham Forest also missed out on the chance to compete in the UEFA Cup as League Cup holders over the next four years. Even when the ban was lifted in 1990, League Cup winners did not participate in European competitions for two more years, when Manchester United won the trophy and qualified for the UEFA Cup anyway, as they had finished second in the league. In the previous two seasons, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday had both been prevented from competing in the UEFA Cup as League Cup winners, due to the gradual reintegration of English clubs in European competitions.

In 2016–17, the competition was renamed the EFL Cup as part of the Football League&#x27;s rebranding to become the English Football League.

===Modern changes===
In the early 21st century, following restructuring of European football, particularly of its international club competitions, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Conference League, there were considerations of removing the prize of European qualification from the League Cup&#x27;s winners. England and France are the only UEFA members to offer a European berth to the winners of their second cup competitions until 2020, when Coupe de la Ligue was suspended indefinitely, meaning England is the only UEFA member to do so. This has allowed the League Cup to retain popularity, especially with fans of clubs for whom success in cup competitions offers their only realistic chance of qualifying for Europe.

===Giant-killings===
Giant-killings are less well remembered in the League Cup than in the FA Cup due to the absence of non-league sides and the fact that big clubs often field more inexperienced sides in the early rounds. However, there have been some notable upsets, the final of 1966–67 saw Division Three side Queens Park Rangers come from 2–0 down at half time to win 3–2 against top-flight West Bromwich Albion in the first League Cup Final to be hosted at Wembley Stadium. Two years later in 1968–69, Third Division side Swindon Town beat Arsenal 3–1 after extra time in the final to win the trophy. In 1974–75, Fourth Division side Chester beating defending league champions Leeds United 3–0 on their surprise run to the semi-finals.

Former League club and now defunct Scarborough defeated Chelsea 4–3 on aggregate in October 1989, while a Fourth Division club. In 1992–93, Scarborough then defeated Coventry City (then a top-tier side) 3–2 on aggregate, before ultimately going out of the competition, narrowly, 1–0, against Arsenal.

In 1995–96, Manchester United were beaten 3–0 at home by York City in the second round, first leg; United could only win 3–1 in the second leg and went out 4–3 on aggregate (York went on to repeat the achievement against Everton the following year). United went on to win the FA Premier League and FA Cup double and did not lose another home game that season, while York narrowly avoided relegation to Division Three (fourth tier).

Grimsby Town recorded a number of upsets over a nine-year stretch; whilst playing in the third tier in 1997–98 they defeated Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday 4–3 on aggregate over both legs before knocking out fellow Premier League side (and League Cup holders) Leicester City 3–1. In 2001–02, they beat current holders Liverpool at Anfield with a 2–1 win in extra time. Four years later, they recorded another giant killing by defeating Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 at home, by this time Grimsby were playing in the fourth tier.

Manchester United have also been knocked out by Southend United and Coventry City in 2006–07 and 2007–08 respectively: in the match against Southend they fielded a strong side with 10 internationals, bucking a trend they had themselves started during the 1990s. In the 2014–15 season, Manchester United fielded five international players but lost 4–0 in the second round (in which they entered the tournament) against third-tier side MK Dons.

In 2010, Liverpool were humbled again by Northampton Town, one of the lowest placed teams in League Two. In the 2012–13 competition, League Two (fourth tier) side Bradford City eliminated three Premier League sides from the competition, becoming the lowest-ranked team to do so since Rochdale in 1961–62. However, their luck finally ran out in the final, where they were beaten by Swansea City. In their centenary year, Swansea became the first team from outside England to win the League Cup on 24 February 2013, when they beat Bradford City 5–0 to win their first major English trophy.

In the 2022–23 competition, Gillingham (then ranked 22nd in League Two) eliminated Brentford (then ranked 11th in the Premier League) in the third round on penalties; the teams were 79 places apart in the English football league system.

==Format==
The League Cup is open to all 92 members of the Premier League and English Football League and is divided into seven rounds, organised so that 32 teams remain by the third round (with the exception of the 1961–62 competition). The fixtures in every round except the final are determined by a random draw. Since 1996–97, teams involved in European competition during the season have received a bye to the third round; the remaining Premier League teams enter at the second round, and the remaining Football League teams enter at the first round. If the number of byes causes an odd number of teams to enter a round, another team may be given a bye (usually the highest-placed team of those relegated from the Premier League the previous season) or a preliminary round may be played between the two teams promoted from the Football Conference the previous season (or, if only one team is promoted, that team would play against the lowest-placed team not to be relegated from the Football League the previous season); preliminary rounds have only been necessary in the 2002–03 and 2011–12 competitions. Up to 1995–96, all teams were involved by the second round, although some received byes to that stage.

Matches in all rounds are single-legged, except for the semi-finals, which have been two-legged since the competition began. The final was two-legged from 1961 to 1966, but has been single-legged ever since. The first round was two-legged from 1975–76 to 2000–01, and the second round was two-legged from 1979–80 to 2000–01. Single-legged matches would be replayed as necessary until 1993–94, when penalties were introduced to settle the first replay; the last single-legged tie to require a replay was played in 1996–97.

Until 1974–75, two-legged ties that remained level after extra time in the second leg would be replayed; in that time, three ties reached a third replay. Between 1975–76 and 1979–80, ties would still be replayed, but a penalty shoot-out would be used to settle ties that could not be decided after a replay; replays of two-legged matches were finally abolished for 1980–81, with the away goals rule and penalties being adopted instead. The semi-finals were the exception to this, with level ties being replayed until 1986–87, after which the away goals rule and penalties were introduced. The semi-finals, when played over two legs, would apply the away goals rule only after extra time. From 2018–19, extra time was scrapped for all rounds except the final, and the away goal rule was scrapped for the semi-final, with level ties going straight to a penalty shoot-out.

===Final===
For the first six seasons of the Football League Cup, the final was played over two legs, one at the home ground of each finalist. Since 1967, the final has been played as a single match at Wembley Stadium, although the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was used between 2001 and 2007, following the demolition of the old Wembley. Between 1967 and 1997, finals that finished level after extra time were replayed at an alternative venue until a winner was decided. The venues that hosted replays were Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, Old Trafford and Maine Road in Manchester and Villa Park in Birmingham. The only final to require two replays was the 1977 final between Aston Villa and Everton.

Since 1998, finals that have finished level after extra time have been decided by penalty shoot-out. Until 1999–2000, the final was played in late March or early April. Thereafter it has been played in late February or early March.

Since 1989–90, the best player in the League Cup final has been presented with the Alan Hardaker Trophy, named after Alan Hardaker, the former secretary of the Football League who devised the Football League Cup. John Terry, Ben Foster, Vincent Kompany and Virgil van Dijk are the only players to win the award more than once.

==Sponsorship==
From 1981 to the present (except in 2016–17), the League Cup has attracted title sponsorship, which meant, unlike its older sibling the FA Cup, the League Cup was named after its sponsor, giving it the following names:


==Trophy==
The winners receive the EFL Cup, of which there have been three designs – the current one also being the original, a three-handled Georgian-style urn with a separate plinth (added later). Designed and manufactured by Mappin &amp; Webb, it weighs 2.976 kg and measures 27 cm by 20.5 cm. It is worth around £20,000. It was used until the 1980–81 competition, before coming back into use ever since the 1990–91 competition. The reason for the break in usage was the introduction of the first competition sponsor – the Milk Marketing Board, who chose to award their own trophy from 1981–82 to 1985–86. The next sponsor, Littlewoods, also chose to award their own trophy, from 1986–87 until 1989–90. Later sponsors have used the original.

==Broadcasters==

In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, 15 matches will be broadcast live by Sky Sports through 2024 with highlights from the several matches on ITV Sport beginning in 2022/23. This competition is included in the EFL broadcast package.

From 2024/25, all matches will be broadcast live by Sky Sports, with ITV shown 1 semi final and the final live.

<text>The Tamar Bridge is a suspension bridge over the River Tamar between Saltash, Cornwall and Plymouth, Devon in southwest England. It is long, running adjacent the Royal Albert Bridge, and part of the A38, a main road between the two counties.

During the 20th century, there was increasing demand to replace or supplement the Saltash and Torpoint ferries, which could not cope with the rise in motor traffic. The Government refused to prioritise the project, so it was financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it was found to be unable to support a European Union requirement for goods vehicle weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002. The extra decks have remained in use, increasing the bridge&#x27;s capacity.

The bridge is tolled for eastbound travel, with a discount available via an electronic payment scheme. It has become a significant landmark in Plymouth, Saltash and the surrounding area, and used on several occasions for protests or to highlight the work of charities and fundraisers.

==Location==

The bridge runs over the River Tamar from near Wearde, Saltash in the west to Riverside, Plymouth in the east. It has a central span of and two side spans of . It is part of the A38, a major cross-country road that runs across Cornwall and Devon, and lies immediately north of the Royal Albert Bridge, a significant railway bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel that opened in 1859. Both bridges are north of the Hamoaze, the estuary that the Tamar feeds into, and the Torpoint Ferry.

== Operations ==
In 1961, approximately 4000 vehicles used the Tamar Bridge each day. This significantly increased in the following decades; in 1998 the hourly rate during the morning rush hour was 2500 vehicles. The average weekday saw 38,200 vehicles cross the bridge and the summer weekday flow was 42,900. Conversely, the Torpoint ferry link could transport a maximum of 300 vehicles per hour.

The bridge is owned and maintained by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these is used as a local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians but could be converted to meet future vehicle demand if alternatives for pedestrians and bicycles were provided, a dedicated ferry, shuttle bus, cable car or bridge have been considered.
The bridge capacity is around 1,800 vehicles per hour per lane over each main and added decks:
* 3,600 per hour for the combined two peak direction main deck lanes
* 1,800 per hour for the off peak direction main deck lane
* 1,800 per hour for the eastbound local link from Saltash over the northern cantilever lane
* southern cantilever lane used for pedestrians and cycles

The toll booth capacity in the eastbound direction only as operated in 2013 was 4,200 vehicles per hour and not considered to be constraining the route flow even though it&#x27;s less than the potential eastbound 5,400 vehicles per hour from two main lanes and Saltash local.

=== Tolls ===
The initial toll for cars was 3s (15p) for a single journey across the bridge, or 4/6 (22½p) for a return, while for lorries it was 14s (70p) and £1 respectively. The Saltash Ferry closed, but the Torpoint Ferry remained in operation; management of the ferry and the bridge is shared so the two crossings are not in direct competition with each other.

By 1979, the toll had risen to 30p for a single car journey. It had risen again to £1 by 1995, which remained in place until 2010, when they were increased to £1.50. On 19 November 2019 the new standard toll was set at £2.00.

The current tolls are £2.60 for cars, and £6.30, £10.40 and £14.30 for 2, 3 and 4-axle goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes respectively. An electronic device called the Tamar Tag can be affixed to a vehicle window, which allows the driver to travel at half-fare. Tolls are only payable when travelling eastbound from Saltash to Plymouth.

There is no charge for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles. Disabled drivers can apply for concessions online or via an office next to the Torpoint Ferry.

==History==

For centuries, road users wishing to go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main options. Travel by coach involved a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further north along the Devon – Cornwall border. The alternative was to catch a ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge&#x27;s present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. The idea for a fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had been discussed in Parliament as early as 1930.

===1950–1962: Construction===
In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council discussed the feasibility of building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as they did not believe it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received royal assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.

Preparatory work on the bridge started in July 1959. The bridge was built using suspended construction, which involved building two concrete towers with support cables over these. Hangers were attached to these cables and the road deck was transported by barge and lifted into place. Cleveland Bridge and Engineering later used the same technique to construct the first Severn Bridge.

The central span of the bridge was . The support cables were both long, with a combined weight of 850 tons. They were constructed for Cleveland Bridge and Engineering by British Ropes Ltd. The deck was made out of a concrete base covered with steel plates approx and of standard road tarmac. The roadway catered for three lanes of traffic and was designed to be wide, with an additional for pedestrians either side of the bridge. It could support an estimated capacity of 20,000 vehicles a day, with a maximum individual vehicle weight of 38 tons. Bridge materials had a similar colour to the Royal Albert Bridge, which it runs parallel to.

The bridge was unofficially opened at 6 am on 24 October 1961, when the construction barriers were removed. It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 26 April 1962.

The total cost of the bridge was £1.8 million (now £ million). It was the first major suspension bridge to be constructed in the UK after World War II, and the longest suspension bridge in Britain.

=== 1991–2001: Widening and strengthening ===
A 1995 inspection found that the bridge was unable to comply with a European Union directive for supporting vehicles up to 40 tons; although the original bridge was designed for 38-ton vehicles, it was only able to support 17-ton vehicles. A feasibility study was carried out for a new Tamar Crossing in 1991, but was rejected as the estimated cost would be around £300 million. The existing bridge could not be closed as it was being used by over 40,000 vehicles a day.

The eventual solution was to add two additional orthotropic cantilever lanes either side of the bridge, which traffic could run on while the original road deck was replaced. The work was designed by Hyder Consulting and constructed by the descendent company of Cleveland Bridge that had worked on the original project. Reconstruction started in 1999, and was slightly delayed owing to an influx of tourists travelling to Cornwall to watch the solar eclipse of 11 August 1999, whose line of totality passed through the county. The new deck contained 82 orthotropic panels, each one measuring by and weighing 20 tons. Work was completed in December 2001 at a total cost of £34 million; the two additional lanes were retained to increase the bridge&#x27;s capacity. The completed construction weighed 25 tons less than the original bridge.

The Tamar Bridge was officially reopened by Princess Anne on 26 April 2002, exactly forty years after the initial opening. Traffic was not expected to increase following the expansion of the bridge, as the Saltash Tunnel further west acts as a buffer for capacity. It was the world&#x27;s first suspension bridge to be widened using cantilevers, and the world&#x27;s first suspension bridge to be widened and strengthened while remaining open to traffic. The project won the British Construction Industry Civil Engineering Award for 2002, the Historic Structures category (30 years or older) of the Institution of Civil Engineers Awards 2002, and was one of eight 
finalists for the Prime Minister&#x27;s Better Public Building Award 2002.

Bill Moreau, chief engineer of the New York State Bridge Authority, was impressed by the project. He visited the bridge shortly after its reconstruction, and hoped that such methods could be possibly used to expand capacity on the three lane Mid-Hudson Bridge across the Hudson River in upstate New York

=== 2001–present ===
In April 2022, a campaign pressure group known as the Tamar Toll Action Group was formed. The group has undertaken a number of peaceful protests with the goal to end tolls on both Tamar Crossings.

In 2023, the Tamar Bridge Committee announced a hike in prices due to its losses upwards of £2 million per year. The proposal received a large number of complaints.

==Legacy==

The Tamar Bridge is a recognisable symbol of the local area, as well as a main road connection between Cornwall and the rest of England, and is seen by supporters of Cornish devolution as being a bridge between two distinct nations.

In March 1998, after the closure of Europe&#x27;s last tin mine at South Crofty in Cornwall (which later reopened for a period, and subsequently closed), the Cornish Solidarity Action Group (CSAG) encouraged commuters to pay the then-£1 toll in pennies. The group thought this would slow down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar subsidies to South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration grants from the government.

== Incidents ==
On 23 January 2004 four protesters climbed onto the gantry over the Tamar Bridge to highlight the work of the group Fathers 4 Justice who promote the rights of fathers in child custody disputes. The protest caused rush-hour tailbacks on both sides of the bridge. Charges against the protesters were later dropped after it was felt there would not be a realistic chance of conviction.

In 2012 local councillors complained when the Olympic organising committee declined to run the Olympic Torch across the Tamar Bridge in the lead-up to the Olympics in London. One councillor said the handover should have been &quot;one of the iconic moments of the whole torch relay in Cornwall&quot;. The official organisers said it was not practical to do so as it would involve closing the bridge.

<text>SuperCupNI, formerly called the Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament and the Dale Farm Milk Cup, is an international youth football tournament held annually in Northern Ireland. The cup matches are mainly played in the North Coast area of Northern Ireland, with matches taking place in the towns of Portrush, Portstewart, Castlerock, Limavady, Coleraine, Ballymoney, Ballymena and Broughshane. Mitre are the Official Ball Sponsor of the SuperCup with a specially designed Pro Max ball being used.

== History ==

The Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament began in 1983 with sixteen teams participating at an Under 16 (Premier) level. Motherwell from Scotland were the first winners. It was founded by Jim Weir, Victor Leonard, George Logan and Bertie Peacock, one of the most famous football players from the region.

The competition was extended in 1985 when an extra age group, the Under 14 (Junior) section was introduced and again the first champions were from Scotland, as Rangers won the Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament at that age level. The competition at both levels has grown in size and stature over the years, with teams increasingly travelling from all continents to compete. The Under 19 (Elite) section was introduced in 1995 with the Welsh finishing the tournament as winners. Traditionally, the finals are played at the Coleraine Showgrounds on the Friday evening.

Internationally capped footballers have taken part in the Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament, such as Charlie Davies, Jonathan Spector, Paul Scholes, and Wayne Rooney have all competed at some level. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup there were 30 Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament veterans playing.

To celebrate the competition&#x27;s silver jubilee, a friendly match took place between Northern Ireland and four-time junior section winners Everton at the Coleraine Showgrounds on 14 July 2007. Everton won the tie 2–0.

One of the key parts to the Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament is the inclusion of six representative teams from each county of Northern Ireland – Antrim, Armagh, Londonderry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone. This system allows young players from across the province to compete against some of the best in the world at their age group.

In October 2013, the Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament organising committee and lead sponsors Dairy Council released a joint statement stating that the long-term sponsors Dairy Council would be withdrawing sponsorship.

In February 2014, the organisers announced that competition would be sponsored by Belfast-based company Dale Farm and that the competition would be known as the Dale Farm Milk Cup for sponsorship reasons. From 2016 it has been known as the Super Cup NI.

== Winners ==
The competition wasn&#x27;t played in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Manchester United&#x27;s under-16s played 3 challenge matches against Coleraine, Ballymena United and Linfield.

==Media coverage==
Since 2005 the Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament has been broadcast on BBC Northern Ireland, taking over from UTV. This has led to much more media coverage as matches from Finals Night are broadcast on BBC Two Northern Ireland. Usually these are from the Premier and Elite section featuring highlights of the junior game which happens earlier in the afternoon. Some Northern Ireland Youth Soccer Tournament matches are broadcast on BBC Two NI, made available to the rest of the UK via BBCi and the BBC Sport website and some other Milk Cup matches are broadcast online. The coverage is usually hosted by Stephen Watson, with commentary by BBC commentators such as Jackie Fullerton, Michael McNamee, Paul Gilmour, Joel Taggart, Grant Cameron and punditry by John O&#x27;Neill, Gerry Armstrong and Oran Kearney.

<text>Waveney was a local government district in Suffolk, England, named after the River Waveney that formed its north-east border. The district council was based in Lowestoft, the major settlement in Waveney. The other towns in the district were Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth and Southwold.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Beccles, Lowestoft and Southwold, along with Bungay and Halesworth urban districts, Wainford Rural District and part of Lothingland Rural District. The population of the district at the 2011 Census was 115,254. The last elections to the council were held on 7 May 2015, the second election after the council moved to a Whole Council election system, meaning all 48 council seats were contested. Before the 2011 elections the council was under Conservative Party control.

At the 2011 election the Conservatives had lost overall control, with both it and the Labour party represented by 23 councillors, the balance of the council being made up of one Green Party and one Independent councillor. A series of procedural moves led to the formation of a Conservative-led administration. At the 2015 election the Conservatives won an absolute majority, with 27 seats, with Labour winning 20 and the Green Party 1.

Waveney district was merged with Suffolk Coastal district on 1 April 2019 to form the new East Suffolk district.

<text>The Haddiscoe Cut or New Cut is a canal in the English county of Norfolk and in The Broads National Park.). The cut was conceived as a way to provide a more direct route from Lowestoft to Norwich, and was built as part of a larger scheme which included the linking of the River Waveney to Oulton Broad and Lake Lothing. It was opened in 1833, but the new route was not a financial success, and it was sold to a railway developer in 1842. It remained in railway ownership until Nationalisation in 1948, and was damaged by floods in 1953. An attempt to close it in 1954 was resisted by local interests, resulting in it being repaired. It is now managed by the Environment Agency.

==History==
Prior to the 1820s, Norwich was served by vessels using the River Yare, which flows through Breydon Water before joining the River Bure and then the North Sea near Great Yarmouth. Breydon Water is a wide expanse of shallow water, and therefore required cargo arriving at Yarmouth to be trans-shipped into smaller vessels which could then reach Norwich. There was discontent among the merchants of Norwich at the cost of trans-shipment, and allegations of systematic theft of cargo, which resulted in a court case in 1820, when 18 men were convicted of taking the goods and another of receiving it. Against this background, William Cubitt was asked to investigate possible solutions in 1814.
Cubitt&#x27;s first plan involved general improvements to the River Yare, and the dredging of a deeper channel along the southern edge of Breydon Water. He estimated that this would cost £35,000, and his plan was published in 1818, but there were immediate objections from the Corporation of Yarmouth, who called on the engineer John Rennie for advice. Rennie concluded that the plan would lead to the silting of Yarmouth harbour. Cubitt therefore looked at alternatives, and produced a plan to link the Yare to Lowestoft, which would cost over £70,000. Yarmouth again objected, but a bill based on the new plan was put before Parliament in 1826. It was defeated, but a second bill was presented, which was passed as the (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. xlii) on 28 May 1827, despite vigorous campaigning against it by Yarmouth.

===Construction===
The new act of Parliament created the Norwich and Lowestoft Navigation Company, and authorised them to raise £100,000, with an additional £50,000 if required. The scheme involved dredging of the River Yare from Norwich to Reedham, to make it deeper, construction of the Haddiscoe cut between Reedham and Haddiscoe on the River Waveney, enlarging of Oulton Dyke, between the Waveney and Oulton Broad, and linking of Oulton Broad to Lake Lothing by a channel which was long, and included a sea lock, so that it could be used at all states of the tide. Work began on the Lake Lothing link, with most of it completed during 1829. The lock was , and included a system of sluices, which used water from Oulton Broad to clear a channel to the sea through Lake Lothing. A demonstration of this was given on 3 June 1831, when it was estimated that 3,000 tons of stones and shingle were carried out to sea.

The contract for the Haddiscoe Cut was signed with Thomas Townsend of Birmingham on 3 July 1832, and work began at once. Thomas Townsend worked as contractor on the canal throughout its construction. The original capital was insufficient to finance the construction, and so the extra £50,000 authorised by the Public Works Loans Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 34) was borrowed from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners. The cut was finished in 1832, and the dredging of the River Yare completed in 1833. The whole route, which is long, was formally opened on 30 September 1833.

===Operation===
The new undertaking was not a financial success, with income failing to match expenditure. The company was unable to repay the £50,000 loan, and so in 1842 the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners took control of the navigation, and sold it to Sir Samuel Morton Peto, a developer who wanted to build railways along its banks. The line from Reedham to Lowestoft runs parallel to the cut and effectively forms the south western bank. Although maintained for navigation, the cut was owned by a series of railway companies for the next hundred years.

Control of the cut passed to the British Transport Commission (BTC) with the nationalisation of the railways in 1948. The cut was damaged by the floods of 1953, which affected much of the East Coast, and the Transport Commission attempted to close it in 1954. Local opposition was strong, particularly from the yachting community, and control of it passed to the East Suffolk and Norfolk River Board in 1957, under provisions that were part of the British Transport Commission Act 1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2. c. xliv). The BTC no longer wanted to maintain the waterway, as there was little commercial traffic using it. The River Board were required to spend at least £24,000 on repairing the banks of the cut, although the BTC would give them £10,000 to assist, and the commissioners of the River Yare would contribute another £10,000 in the two years following the transfer. The River Board were required to maintain the waterway for navigation for at least ten years, but after that could decide to close it and all rights of navigation would be removed. Subsequently, the Anglian Water Authority, and in 1995 the Environment Agency, took over responsibility for managing the cut.

==Today==
In 1993 failure of the piling resulted in part of the railway embankment being washed away. More recently, flood prevention measures have resulted in reconstruction of the river defences and walls, and this work was completed in 2006.
High water levels combined with low sections of flood defences and severe flooding in January 2022 resulted in part of the railway embankment being washed away again, resulting in further steel piling to rebuild the bank.

<text>The River Yare is a river in the English county of Norfolk. In its lower reaches it is one of the principal navigable waterways of The Broads and connects with the rest of the network.

The river rises south of Dereham to the west to the village of Shipdham. Above its confluence with a tributary stream from Garvestone it is known as the Blackwater River. From there it flows in a generally eastward direction passing Barnham Broom and is joined by the River Tiffey before reaching Bawburgh. It then skirts the southern fringes of the city of Norwich, passing through Colney, Cringleford, Lakenham and Trowse. At Whitlingham it is joined by the River Wensum and although the Wensum is the larger and longer of the two, the river downstream of their confluence continues to be called the Yare. Flowing eastward into The Broads it passes the villages of Bramerton, Surlingham, Rockland St. Mary and Cantley. Just before Reedham at Hardley Cross (erected in 1676) it is joined by the River Chet. The cross marks the ancient boundary between the City of Norwich and Borough of Great Yarmouth. Beyond Reedham the river passes the famously isolated marshland settlement of Berney Arms before entering the tidal lake of Breydon Water. Here the Yare is joined by the Rivers Waveney and Bure and finally enters the North Sea at Gorleston, Great Yarmouth.

The Yare is the frequent subject of landscape paintings by members of the early 19th century Norwich School of artists. The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. contains an oil painting by John Crome entitled &quot;Moonlight on the Yare&quot;. Joseph Stannard depicted the river in &quot;Thorpe Water Frolic, Afternoon&quot; (1824) and &quot;Boats on the Yare near Bramerton&quot; (1828) which is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

The river is navigable to small coastal vessels from Norwich to the sea, and in former times carried significant commercial traffic to that city. At Reedham the river is joined by the Haddiscoe Cut, a canal which provides a direct navigable link to the River Waveney at Haddiscoe avoiding Breydon Water.

==Navigation==
The river provides a navigable link between Norwich and the North Sea, but silting has been a long-standing problem. In 1698, an Act of Parliament was obtained which allowed duty to be collected for any coal traffic using the river. The money raised was to pay for improvements to the course of the river and to the harbour at Great Yarmouth, but the majority of it went towards harbour improvements, and little improvement of the river occurred. Three more acts attempted to rectify the situation, but the river continued to be neglected. A fifth act, obtained in 1772, sought to address the problem in a different way, and specified how the tolls were to be used. 15 per cent was to be given to Norwich for river improvements between the city and Hardley Cross, 25 per cent was given to Yarmouth for improvements to the lower river between Hardley Cross and the town, with a further 40 per cent set aside for maintenance of Yarmouth harbour. Other rivers benefitted from the remaining 20 per cent.

The size of vessels that could reach Norwich was limited by the shallow channel crossing Breydon Water, and so all goods arriving from the North Sea had to be trans-shipped to smaller vessels at Yarmouth. In order to improve the situation the merchants of Norwich asked William Cubitt to look for a solution in 1814. His proposal consisted of dredging a new channel to the south side of Breydon Water and making various improvements to the river. This was costed at £35,000, but the plan was opposed by Yarmouth Corporation when it was made public in 1818. John Rennie, acting for the corporation, concluded that the plan might result in silting of the harbour, and so Cubitt proposed an alternative, which would link the Yare to Lowestoft. This was also opposed by Yarmouth Corporation, but despite the cost being more than double, and assurances from Thomas Telford and James Walker that improved navigation to Norwich would not harm Yarmouth, this was the plan that was laid before Parliament in 1826.

The Act would authorise dredging of the Yare between Norwich and Reedham, from where a canal would be built to connect to the River Waveney at Haddiscoe. Oulton Dyke would be enlarged, and a cut and lock built to link Oulton Broad to Lake Lothing, and hence the North Sea. At the formal enquiry, six engineers gave evidence for the proposal, but the opposition of Yarmouth and local landowners who feared potential flooding resulted in the bill being narrowly defeated. Similar plans were submitted in the next parliamentary session, with Yarmouth spending £8,000 to ensure its defeat. Evidence for the plan included details of widespread theft during the transshipment process at Yarmouth. A man had hidden in a wicker basket to record the conversations and activities of the thieves, and ultimately 18 men were convicted of taking the goods and one of receiving it. The Act was granted on 28 May 1827.

The Act allowed the Norwich and Lowestoft Navigation Company to raise £100,000 as capital, with an additional £50,000 if necessary. Work started at the Lowestoft end, with Alderman Crisp Brown of Norwich cutting the first sod in the autumn. The lock and channel between Oulton Broad and Lake Lothing were completed by 1829, and the first vessel used Lowestoft harbour on 3 June 1831. Costs overran, and to complete the Haddiscoe cut, the additional £50,000 authorised by the Act was raised by taking a loan from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners. The cut was completed in 1832, and the improvements of the remaining to Norwich were finished by the autumn of 1833. A grand opening was held on 30 September 1833, when it was planned that the &quot;Jarrow&quot; would tow two vessels, the &quot;City of Norwich&quot; and the &quot;Squire&quot;, which were moored at Lowestoft, to Norwich. Unfortunately, the &quot;Jarrow&quot; was at Yarmouth, and the Corporation refused to open the bridge at the head of Breydon Water to allow the vessel to pass. The captain eventually cut down the funnel, but the delay resulted in him missing the tide, and he had to wait to cross Breydon Water. The convoy reached Norwich the following day, where 10,000 people lined the banks of the river to witness the event.

Despite high hopes, the venture was not a success, as operating costs exceeded revenue, and the loan from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission could not be repaid. The arrival of the railways added an element of competition, and the Commissioners took over the Haddiscoe Cut in 1842, selling it on to Sir Samuel Morton Peto, a railway developer. A new cut was made at Thorpe in 1844, where the railway crossed a loop in the river. The bridges at both ends of the old course restrict headroom to about . The City of Norwich attempted to buy the navigation in 1848, but were again opposed by Yarmouth, and withdrew their bill from Parliament. Silting of Lake Lothing became a problem, and traffic gradually reverted to using the route through Yarmouth. A grandiose plan to build a ship canal between Yarmouth and Norwich with a commercial dock at Whitlingham and a naval base at Rockland Broad, proposed in 1908, came to nothing, but steam tugs continued to haul barges of coal to Norwich until the 1960s. Commercial traffic has now been replaced by leisure boating.

The river is tidal as far as Trowse Mills, with a tidal range of at Reedham and at Norwich. High water at Reedham occurs some hours after high water at Yarmouth, and at Norwich it is hours after Yarmouth.

==Hydronymy==
The derivation of the name has been the subject of debate, M. R. James states that the Saxon Shore fort, Gariannonum (which he identified as Burgh Castle) takes its name from the original Common Celtic name for the Yare. Ptolemy records a Latinized version of this name as &quot;Gariennos&quot; around 150 AD. Eilert Ekwall gives another derivation, that the river name is a back-formation from Yarmouth.

==Wherryman&#x27;s Way==
Opened in 2005, the 35 mile long Wherryman&#x27;s Way follows the route of the historic Broads trading wherries between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. It winds through existing footpaths, open marshes, reedbeds, grazing meadows and riverside villages along the banks of the River Yare. The path passes numerous information panels, sculptures and audio posts which seek to bring to life the characters and history of the route.

<text>The Norfolk wherry is a type of sailing boat used on The Broads in Norfolk and Suffolk, England. Three main types were developed over its life, all featuring the distinctive gaff rig with a single, high-peaked sail and the mast stepped well forward.

==Development of the wherry==
Wherries were sail and oar craft dating back to at least 1604. These were small craft, in 1727 being of 8 tons net tonnage. They were still sail and oar boats, fitted with hoops and canvas tilts for the comfort of their passengers. They would have provided a service carrying passengers and small perishable cargoes. Alongside these early wherries were the bigger keels, which were transom-sterned clinker-built barges with a square sail on a mast stepped amidships of about by and able to carry 30 tons of goods. The keel had been built since the Middle Ages and the design probably went back to the Viking invasion. After 1800, the Norfolk Keel (or &#x27;keel wherry&#x27;) disappeared, partly because a wherry could be sailed with fewer crew, and it had limited manoeuvrability and lacked speed.

==Types of wherry==
The &#x27;Trading Wherry&#x27; developed from the Keel. It is double-ended, its hull painted black with a white nose to aid visibility after dusk. Most trading wherries were clinker-built, but &quot;Albion&quot;, surviving today, was the sole example to be carvel-built. They carry a gaff rig, the sail historically also black from being treated with a mixture of tar and fish oil to protect it from the elements. The mast tops and wind vanes were often painted or shaped (respectively) to identify the wherry&#x27;s owner - a traditional design is a &#x27;Jenny Morgan&#x27;, after a folk song character. Sizes varied, but many of these vessels would carry around 25 tons of goods. Wherries were able to reach larger boats just off the coast at Great Yarmouth or Lowestoft and take their cargoes off to be transported inland through the broads and rivers. The last trading wherry, &quot;Ella&quot;, was built in 1912.

The &#x27;Pleasure Wherry&#x27; evolved as railways took on the cargo business that had supported the traders. Enterprising owners realised that conversion to carry passengers was a way to replace the lost income, especially as the Broads were at the same time being discovered as a destination for tourism and recreation. Early examples simply featured hammocks and a stove in the hold of a trader, but boatbuilders soon began to make craft specifically for pleasure sailing and holidays, using the same hull and rig design but incorporating living quarters instead of a cargo hold. Some were fitted out to a very high standard indeed; for example, &quot;Hathor&quot;, built for the Colman family (of mustard fame), features highly detailed marquetry in Egyptian designs below decks.

For some holidaymakers, the distinction between the working boats and pleasure wherries was not strong enough, and the sleeker and more genteel &#x27;Wherry Yacht&#x27; was developed. The main distinguishing features are a smooth, white yacht-like hull and a large counter-stern providing a quiet seating area away from the sail winch and any quanting activity.

Wherries came in different sizes, according to the river they used. The North Walsham and Dilham Canal Wherry was maximum x x 3&#x27; 6&quot;. The River Ant Wherry was 50&#x27; x 12&#x27; max. The River Bure Wherry was 54&#x27; x 12&#x27; 8&quot;, but for the Aylsham Navigation, i.e. the upper reaches of the Bure, the boats had to be 12&#x27; 6&quot; x 3&#x27; 6&quot; maximum.

On the southern Broads, steam wherries were used. The River Waveney Wherry was 70&#x27; x 16&#x27; max.

The mast is pivoted with a large counterbalance weight at the bottom. This enables the wherry to lower the mast for passing under bridges. The mast can be dropped, the wherry continues forward under its momentum and the mast is raised again on the far side by the crew of two. If there is no wind, or the wherry must be turned or otherwise manoeuvred, quant poles are used to provide the required force.

A special wherry wheelbarrow was used to unload cargo, e.g. stone, from the wherries. It was made from wood and strengthened with iron bands. It had no legs, therefore it could be rested on the planks on the side of the wherry.

==Survivors==
All types of wherry eventually became uneconomic to run, but a small number have been saved either by private individuals or charities. Most of the survivors can be seen sailing up and down the rivers and broads today, although some are awaiting full restoration. Of the eight surviving examples of recreational and commercial sailing wherries, seven are on the National Register of Historic Ships. An eighth wherry listed on the Register is &quot;Jester&quot; a motorized ice wherry of 1923.

In April 2011, Wherry Yacht Charter Charitable Trust opened their restored base in Wroxham, where work on the restoration and maintenance of the Edwardian pleasure wherry &quot;Hathor&quot; and wherry yachts &quot;Norada&quot; and &quot;Olive&quot; can be undertaken in all weathers. The site located at Barton House was part of a £1.5 million project. As of Easter 2012, &quot;White Moth&quot; is also based here. &quot;Norada&quot; was officially relaunched after restoration in July 2012, while &quot;Olive&quot; celebrated similarly in July 2013. The Norfolk Wherry Trust keep trading wherry &quot;Albion&quot; at Forsythe Wherry Yard, off Womack Water at Ludham; trading wherry &quot;Maud&quot; also berths here in the winter. &quot;Solace&quot; can usually be seen on Wroxham Broad in the sailing season, while &quot;Ardea&quot; is often seen at Southgates yard in Horning.
Images of wherries can be seen on many pub signs and village signs. There is also a mosaic of a wherry at North Walsham, part of a special monument commemorating the Millennium celebrations.

<text>Jeannette Pickering Rankin (June 11, 1880 – May 18, 1973) was an American politician and women&#x27;s rights advocate who became the first woman to hold federal office in the United States. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican from Montana in 1916 for one term, then was elected again in 1940. Rankin remains the only woman ever elected to Congress from Montana.

Each of Rankin&#x27;s congressional terms coincided with the initiation of U.S. military intervention in both world wars. A lifelong pacifist, she was one of 50 House members who opposed the declaration of war on Germany in 1917. In 1941, she was the sole member of Congress to vote against the declaration of war on Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

A suffragist during the Progressive Era, Rankin organized and lobbied for legislation enfranchising women in several states, including Montana, New York, and North Dakota. While in Congress, she introduced legislation that eventually became the 19th Constitutional Amendment, granting unrestricted voting rights to women nationwide. She championed a multitude of diverse women&#x27;s rights and civil rights causes throughout a career that spanned more than six decades. In 1920, she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union and served as a vice president.

== Early life ==
Rankin was born on June 11, 1880, near Missoula in Montana Territory, nine years before the territory became a state, to school teacher Olive (&quot;née&quot; Pickering) and Scottish-Canadian immigrant John Rankin, a wealthy mill owner. She was the eldest of six children, including five sisters (one of whom died in childhood) and a brother, Wellington, who became Montana&#x27;s attorney general and later, a justice on the Montana Supreme Court. One of her sisters, Edna Rankin McKinnon, became the first Montana-born woman to pass the bar exam in Montana and was an early social activist for access to birth control.

As an adolescent on her family ranch, Rankin had many tasks, including cleaning, sewing, farm chores, outdoor work, and helping care for her younger siblings. She helped maintain the ranch machinery and once single-handedly built a wooden sidewalk for a building her father owned so it could be rented. Rankin later recorded her childhood observation that while women of the 1890s western frontier labored side by side as equals with men, they did not have an equal political voice—nor a legal right to vote.

Rankin graduated from high school in 1898. She studied at the University of Montana and, in 1902, received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. Before her political and advocacy career, she explored a variety of careers, including dressmaking, furniture design, and teaching. After her father died in 1904, Rankin took on the responsibility of caring for her younger siblings.

== Activism and suffrage movement ==

At the age of 27, Rankin moved to San Francisco to take a job in social work, a new and developing field. Confident that she had found her calling, she enrolled in the New York School of Philanthropy in New York City from 1908 to 1909. After a brief period as a social worker in Spokane, Washington, Rankin moved to Seattle to attend the University of Washington, and became involved in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. In November 1910, Washington voters approved an amendment to their state constitution to permanently enfranchise women, the fifth state in the Union to do so. Returning to New York, Rankin became one of the organizers of the New York Woman Suffrage Party, which joined with other suffrage organizations to promote a similar suffrage bill in that state&#x27;s legislature. During this period, Rankin also traveled to Washington to lobby Congress on behalf of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).

Rankin returned to Montana and rose through the ranks of suffrage organizations, becoming the president of the Montana Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association and the national field secretary of NAWSA. In February 1911, she became the first woman to speak before the Montana legislature, arguing in support of enfranchisement for women in her home state. In November 1914, Montana became the seventh state to grant women unrestricted voting rights. Rankin coordinated the efforts of a variety of grassroots organizations to promote her suffrage campaigns in New York and Montana (and later in North Dakota as well). Later, she would draw from the same grassroots infrastructure during her 1916 congressional campaign.

Rankin later compared her work in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement to promoting the pacifist foreign policy that defined her congressional career. She believed, as did many suffragists of the period, that the corruption and dysfunction of the United States government resulted from a lack of women&#x27;s participation. At a disarmament conference during the interwar period, she said, &quot;The peace problem is a woman&#x27;s problem.&quot;
==House of Representatives==

===First congressional term===

Rankin&#x27;s campaign for one of Montana&#x27;s two at-large House seats in the congressional election of 1916 was financed and managed by her brother Wellington, an influential member of the Montana Republican Party. She traveled long distances to reach the state&#x27;s widely scattered population. Rankin rallied support at train stations, street corners, potluck suppers on ranches, and remote one-room schoolhouses. She ran as a progressive, emphasizing her support of suffrage, social welfare, and prohibition. Before her election she spoke on several occasions in favor of proportional representation.

In the Republican primary, Rankin received the most votes of the eight Republican candidates. In the at-large general election on November 7, the top two vote-getters won the seats. Rankin finished second in the voting, defeating Frank Bird Linderman, among others, to become the first woman elected to Congress. During her victory speech, she said, &quot;I am deeply conscious of the responsibility resting upon me&quot; as the only woman in the nation with voting power in Congress. Her election generated considerable nationwide interest, including, reportedly, several marriage proposals.

Shortly after her term began, Congress was called into an extraordinary April session in response to Germany declaring unrestricted submarine warfare on all Atlantic shipping. On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson, addressing a joint session, asked Congress to &quot;make the world safe for democracy&quot; by declaring war on Germany. After intense debate, the war resolution came to a vote in the House at 3:00 am on April 6; Rankin cast one of 50 votes in opposition. &quot;I wish to stand for my country,&quot; she said, &quot;but I cannot vote for war.&quot; Years later, she would add, &quot;I felt the first time the first woman had a chance to say no to war, she should say it.&quot; Although 49 male Representatives and six Senators also voted against the declaration, Rankin was singled out for criticism. Some considered her vote a discredit to the suffragist movement and her authority in Congress; but others applauded it, including Alice Paul of the National Woman&#x27;s Party and Representative Fiorello La Guardia of New York.

Rankin used her office to push for better working conditions for laborers. On June 8, 1917, the Speculator Mine disaster in Butte left 168 miners dead. Workers called a massive protest strike over working conditions. Rankin tried to intervene, but mining companies refused to meet with her or the miners, and her proposed legislation to end the strike was unsuccessful. She had greater success pushing for better working conditions in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Rankin listened to the grievances of federal workers in the bureau, which included long hours and an excessively demanding work pace. She hired investigative reporter Elizabeth Watson to investigate. As a result of her efforts to draw attention to the working conditions of the bureau, Treasury Secretary William McAdoo convened his own investigation and ultimately limited the work day to eight hours.

By 1917, women had been granted some form of voting rights in about forty states. Rankin continued to lead the movement for unrestricted universal enfranchisement. She was instrumental in the creation of the Committee on Woman Suffrage and became one of its founding members. In January 1918, the committee delivered its report to Congress, and Rankin opened congressional debate on a Constitutional amendment granting universal suffrage to women. The resolution passed in the House but was defeated by the Senate. The following year—after Rankin&#x27;s congressional term had ended—the same resolution passed both chambers. After ratification by three-fourths of the states, it became the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

During Rankin&#x27;s term, Montana&#x27;s state legislature voted to replace the state&#x27;s two at-large Congressional seats with two single-member districts. With little chance of reelection in the overwhelmingly Democratic western district, Rankin chose instead to run for the Senate in 1918. After losing the Republican primary to physician Oscar M. Lanstrum, she accepted the nomination of the National Party and finished third in the general election behind Lanstrum and incumbent Democrat Thomas J. Walsh.

===Between terms===

After leaving Congress, Rankin worked as a field secretary for the National Consumers League and as a lobbyist for various pacifist organizations. She argued for the passage of a Constitutional amendment banning child labor and supported the Sheppard–Towner Act, the first federal social welfare program created explicitly for women and children. The legislation was enacted in 1921 but repealed eight years later, though many of its key provisions were incorporated into the Social Security Act of 1935.

In 1920, Rankin helped found the American Civil Liberties Union and served as a vice president.

In 1924, Rankin bought a small farm in Georgia. She lived a simple life there, without electricity or plumbing, although she also maintained a residence in Montana. Rankin made frequent speeches around the country on behalf of the Women&#x27;s Peace Union and the National Council for the Prevention of War (NCPW). In 1928 she founded the Georgia Peace Society, which served as headquarters for her pacifism campaign until its dissolution in 1941, on the eve of the U.S. involvement in World War II.

In 1937, Rankin opposed President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s proposals to intervene on the British side against Germany and its allies, arguing that both sides wished to avoid a second European war and would pursue a diplomatic solution. She testified before multiple Congressional committees in opposition to various preparedness measures. When it became clear that her lobbying efforts were largely ineffective, Rankin resigned from her NCPW position and declared her intention to regain her seat in the House of Representatives.

===Second congressional term===

Rankin began her campaign for Congress in 1939 with a tour of high schools in Montana. She arranged to speak in 52 of the first congressional district&#x27;s 56 high schools to reestablish her ties to the region after years of spending much of her time in Georgia. Once again, Rankin enjoyed the political support of her well connected brother Wellington, even though the siblings had increasingly divergent lifestyles and political views.

In the 1940 race, Rankin—at age 60—defeated incumbent Jacob Thorkelson, an outspoken antisemite, in the July primary, and former Representative Jerry J. O&#x27;Connell in the general election. She was appointed to the Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on Insular Affairs. While members of Congress and their constituents had been debating the question of U.S. intervention in World War II for months, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, galvanized the country and silenced virtually all opposition.

On December 8, Rankin was the only member of either chamber of Congress to vote against the declaration of war on Japan. Hisses could be heard in the gallery as she cast her vote; several colleagues, including Rep. (later Senator) Everett Dirksen, asked her to change it to make the resolution unanimous—or at very least, to abstain—but she refused. &quot;As a woman I can&#x27;t go to war,&quot; she said, &quot;and I refuse to send anyone else.&quot;

After the vote, a crowd of reporters pursued Rankin into a cloakroom. There, she was forced to take refuge in a phone booth until Capitol Police arrived to escort her to her office, where she was inundated with angry telegrams and phone calls. One cable from her brother read, &quot;Montana is 100 percent against you.&quot; A wire-service photo of Rankin sequestered in the phone booth, calling for assistance, appeared the following day in newspapers across the country.

While her action was widely ridiculed in the press, Progressive leader William Allen White, writing in the Kansas &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot;, acknowledged her courage in taking it:
 Probably a hundred men in Congress would have liked to do what she did. Not one of them had the courage to do it. The &quot;Gazette&quot; entirely disagrees with the wisdom of her position. But Lord, it was a brave thing! And its bravery someway discounted its folly. When, in a hundred years from now, courage, sheer courage based upon moral indignation is celebrated in this country, the name of Jeannette Rankin, who stood firm in folly for her faith, will be written in monumental bronze– not for what she did but for the way she did it.

Three days later, a similar war declaration against Germany and Italy came to a vote; Rankin abstained. With her political career effectively over, she did not run for reelection in 1942. Asked years later if she ever regretted her action, Rankin replied, &quot;Never. If you&#x27;re against war, you&#x27;re against war regardless of what happens. It&#x27;s a wrong method of trying to settle a dispute.&quot; John F. Kennedy would write about Rankin&#x27;s decisions, &quot;Few members of Congress have ever stood more alone while being true to a higher honor and loyalty.&quot;

==Later life==

Over the next twenty years, Rankin travelled the world, frequently visiting India, where she studied the pacifist teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. She maintained homes in both Georgia and Montana.
In the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation of pacifists, feminists, and civil rights advocates found inspiration in Rankin and embraced her efforts in ways that her generation had not. She mobilized again in response to the Vietnam War. In January 1968, the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, a coalition of women&#x27;s peace groups, organized an anti-war march in Washington, D.C.—the largest march by women since the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913. Rankin led 5,000 participants from Union Station to the steps of the Capitol Building, where they presented a peace petition to House Speaker John McCormack. Simultaneously, a splinter group of activists from the women&#x27;s liberation movement created a protest within the Brigade&#x27;s protest by staging a &quot;Burial of True Womanhood&quot; at Arlington National Cemetery to draw attention to the passive role allotted to women as wives and mothers. In 1972, Rankin—by then in her nineties—considered mounting a third House campaign to gain a wider audience for her opposition to the Vietnam War, but longstanding throat and heart ailments forced her to abandon that final project.

==Personal life==

Rankin never married. While she maintained a lifelong, close friendship with the noted journalist and author Katherine Anthony, the women were never romantically involved. Rankin&#x27;s biographers disagree on her sexual orientation, but generally agree that she was too consumed by her work to pursue committed personal relationships.

==Death and legacy==
Rankin died on May 18, 1973, at age 92, in Carmel, California. There is a memorial stone dedicated to her in the Missoula Cemetery. She bequeathed her estate, including the property in Watkinsville, Georgia, to help &quot;mature, unemployed women workers&quot;. Her Montana residence, known as the Rankin Ranch, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Jeannette Rankin Foundation (now the Jeannette Rankin Women&#x27;s Scholarship Fund), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, awards annual educational scholarships to low-income women 35 and older across the United States. Beginning with a single $500 scholarship in 1978, the fund has since awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships to more than 700 women.

A statue of Rankin by Terry Mimnaugh, inscribed &quot;I Cannot Vote For War&quot;, was placed in the United States Capitol&#x27;s Statuary Hall in 1985. At its dedication, historian Joan Hoff-Wilson called Rankin &quot;one of the most controversial and unique women in Montana and American political history.&quot; A replica stands in Montana&#x27;s capitol building in Helena. In 1993, Rankin was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2004, peace activist Jeanmarie Simpson produced and starred in the one-woman play &quot;A Single Woman&quot;, based on the life of Rankin, to benefit peace organizations. Simpson also starred in a film adaptation that was directed and produced by Kamala Lopez, narrated by Martin Sheen, and featuring music by Joni Mitchell.

Opera America commissioned a song cycle about Rankin called &quot;Fierce Grace&quot; that premiered in 2017. In 2018, the Kalispell Brewing Company commissioned a mural on the side of its building in Kalispell, Montana, featuring a Rankin caricature and quotation.

Rankin is the subject of the musical &quot;We Won&#x27;t Sleep&quot; (formerly &quot;Jeannette&quot;) with music and lyrics by Arianna Afsar and a book by Lauren Gunderson. Under the title &quot;Jeannette&quot;, the musical was part of the 2019 summer series at the National Music Theater Conference at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Connecticut.

Although her legacy rests almost entirely on her pacifism, Rankin told the Montana Constitutional Convention in 1972 that she would have preferred otherwise. &quot;If I am remembered for no other act,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to be remembered as the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to vote.&quot;

<doc id="145014" wikidata="Q504529" url="?curid=145014" title="Theodore of Tarsus">
<text>Theodore of Tarsus (; 60219 September 690) was Archbishop of Canterbury from 668 to 690. Theodore grew up in Tarsus, but fled to Constantinople after the Persian Empire conquered Tarsus and other cities. After studying there, he relocated to Rome and was later installed as the Archbishop of Canterbury on the orders of Pope Vitalian. Accounts of his life appear in two 8th-century texts. Theodore is best known for his reform of the English Church and establishment of a school in Canterbury.

==Sources==
Theodore&#x27;s life can be divided into the time before his arrival in Britain as Archbishop of Canterbury, and his archiepiscopate. Until recently, scholarship on Theodore had focused on only the latter period since it is attested in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English&quot; (&quot;c&quot; 731), and also in Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; (early 700s), whereas no source directly mentions Theodore&#x27;s earlier activities. However, Bernard Bischoff and Michael Lapidge reconstructed his earlier life based on a study of texts produced by his Canterbury School.

==Early life==
Theodore was of Greek descent and was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, a Greek-speaking diocese of the Byzantine Empire. Theodore&#x27;s childhood saw devastating wars between Byzantium and the Persian Sassanid Empire, which resulted in the capture of Antioch, Damascus, and Jerusalem in 613–614. Persian forces captured Tarsus when Theodore was 11 or 12 years old, and there is evidence that Theodore had experience of Persian culture. It is most likely that he studied at Antioch, the historic home of a distinctive school of exegesis, of which he was a proponent. Theodore also knew Syriac culture, language and literature, and may even have travelled to Edessa. The Syriac &quot;Acts&quot; of St. Milus of Persia, which was incorporated into the Old English Martyrology, was probably brought to England by Theodore.

Though a Greek could live under Persian rule, the Muslim conquests, which reached Tarsus in 637, certainly drove Theodore from Tarsus; unless he fled even earlier, Theodore would have been 35 years old when he left his birthplace. Having returned to the Eastern Roman Empire, he studied in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, including the subjects of astronomy, ecclesiastical computus (calculation of the date of Easter), astrology, medicine, Roman civil law, Greek rhetoric and philosophy, and the use of the horoscope.

At some time before the 660s, Theodore had travelled west to Rome, where he lived with a community of Eastern monks, probably at the monastery of St. Anastasius. At this time, in addition to his already profound Greek intellectual inheritance, he became learned in Latin literature, both sacred and secular. The Synod of Whitby (664) having confirmed the decision in the Anglo-Saxon Church to follow Rome, in 667, when Theodore was aged 66, the see of Canterbury happened to fall vacant. Wighard, the man chosen to fill the post, unexpectedly died. Wighard had been sent to Pope Vitalian by Ecgberht, king of Kent, and Oswy, king of Northumbria, for consecration as archbishop. Following Wighard&#x27;s death, Theodore was chosen by Vitalian upon the recommendation of Hadrian (later abbot of St. Peter&#x27;s, Canterbury). Theodore was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury in Rome on 26 March 668, and sent to England with Hadrian, arriving on 27 May 669.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
Theodore conducted a survey of the English church, appointed various bishops to sees that had lain vacant for some time, and then called the Synod of Hertford (673) to institute reforms concerning the proper calculation of Easter, episcopal authority, itinerant monks, the regular convening of subsequent synods, marriage and prohibitions of consanguinity, and other matters.
He also proposed subdividing the large diocese of Northumbria, a policy which brought him into conflict with Wilfrid, who had become Bishop of York in 664. Theodore deposed and expelled Wilfrid in 678, dividing his diocese in the aftermath. The conflict with Wilfrid was settled only in 686–687.

In 679 Aelfwine, the brother of King Ecgfrith of Northumbria, died in battle fighting against the Mercians. Theodore&#x27;s intervention prevented the escalation of the war and resulted in peace between the two kingdoms, with King Æthelred of Mercia paying &quot;weregild&quot; compensation for Aelfwine&#x27;s death.

==Canterbury School==

Theodore and Hadrian established a school in Canterbury, providing instruction in both Greek and Latin, resulting in a &quot;golden age&quot; of Anglo-Saxon scholarship:

:They attracted a large number of students, into whose minds they poured the waters of wholesome knowledge day by day. In addition to instructing them in the Holy Scriptures, they also taught their pupils poetry, astronomy, and the calculation of the church calendar ... Never had there been such happy times as these since the English settled Britain.

Theodore also taught sacred music, introduced various texts, knowledge of Eastern saints, and may even have been responsible for the introduction of the Litany of the Saints, a major liturgical innovation, into the West. Some of his thoughts are accessible in the Biblical Commentaries, notes compiled by his students at the Canterbury School. Of immense interest is the text, recently attributed to him, called &quot;Laterculus Malalianus&quot;. Overlooked for many years, it was rediscovered in the 1990s, and has since been shown to contain numerous interesting elements reflecting Theodore&#x27;s trans-Mediterranean formation. A record of the teaching of Theodore and Adrian is preserved in the Leiden Glossary.

Pupils from the school at Canterbury were sent out as Benedictine abbots in southern England, disseminating the curriculum of Theodore.

Theodore called other synods, in September 680 at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, confirming English orthodoxy in the Monothelite controversy, and circa 684 at Twyford, near Alnwick in Northumbria. Lastly, a penitential composed under his direction is still extant.

Theodore died in 690 at the age of 88, having held the archbishopric for twenty-two years. He was buried in Canterbury at the church known today as St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey; at the time of his death it was called St. Peter&#x27;s church.

==Veneration==
Like the archbishops of Canterbury before him, Theodore is venerated as a saint; his saint&#x27;s day is 19 September in the Orthodox Church, Catholic Church, and Anglican churches. He is also recorded on this day in the Roman Martyrology. Canterbury also recognises a feast of his ordination on 26 March.

<text>Aylsham ( or ) is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Bure in north Norfolk, England, nearly north of Norwich. The river rises near Melton Constable, upstream from Aylsham and continues to Great Yarmouth and the North Sea, although it was only made navigable after 1779, allowing grain, coal and timber to be brought up river.

The town is close to large estates and grand country houses at Blickling, Felbrigg, Mannington and Wolterton, which are important tourist attractions.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 5,504 increasing to a population of 6,016 at the 2011 census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Broadland.

==History==

Archaeological evidence shows that the site of the town has been occupied since prehistoric times. Aylsham is just over two miles (3 km) from a substantial Roman settlement at Brampton, linked to Venta Icenorum at Caistor St Edmund, south of Norwich, by a Roman road which can still be traced in places – that site was a bustling industrial centre with maritime links to the rest of the empire. Excavations in the 1970s provided evidence of several kilns, showing that this was an industrial centre, pottery and metal items being the main items manufactured.

Aylsham is thought to have been founded around 500 AD by an Anglo Saxon thegn called Aegel, &quot;Aegel&#x27;s Ham&quot;, meaning &quot;Aegel&#x27;s settlement&quot;. The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Elesham&quot; and &quot;Ailesham&quot;, with a population of about 1,000. Until the 15th century, the linen and worsted industry was important here, as well as in North Walsham and Worstead and &quot;Aylsham webb&quot; or &#x27;cloth of Aylsham&#x27; was supplied to the royal palaces of Edward II and III.

John of Gaunt was lord of the manor from 1372 and Aylsham became the principal town of the Duchy of Lancaster. Although John of Gaunt probably never came to Aylsham, the townspeople enjoyed many privileges, including exemption from jury service outside the manor and from payment of certain taxes. The village sign depicts John of Gaunt.

In 1519 Henry VIII granted a market on Saturdays and an annual fair to be held on 12 March, which was the eve of the feast of St Gregory the pope. Aylsham markets have always been an important feature of the town, and businesses developed to meet the needs of the town and the farming lands around it. Besides weekly markets there were cattle fairs twice a year and, in October, a hiring fair.

The historic Black Boys Inn in the Market Place is one of Aylsham&#x27;s oldest surviving buildings, and has been on the site since the 1650s, although the present frontage dates to between 1710 and 1720. There is a frieze of small black boys on the cornice and a good staircase and assembly room. The Black Boys was a stop for the post coach from Norwich to Cromer, had stabling for 40 horses, and employed three ostlers and four postboys.

A thatched waterpump was built in 1911 at Carr&#x27;s Corner in memory of John Soame by his uncle, a wealthy financier. An artesian well 170 feet (52 m) deep, its canopy is thatched in Norfolk reed.

As with many of the other market towns in the county, the weaving of local cloth brought prosperity to the town in medieval times. Until the 15th century it was the manufacture of linen which was the more important, and Aylsham linens and Aylsham canvases were nationally known. From the 16th century linen manufacture declined and wool became more important, a situation that continued until the coming of the Industrial Revolution. Thereafter the principal trade of the town for the 19th century was grain and timber, together with the range of trades to be found in a town which supported local agriculture. Records show that Aylsham had markets and fairs, certainly from the 13th century. Such weekly and annual events were important for the trade that they brought. Annual horse fairs would bring many other traders to the town, and the weekly market would be the occasion for more local trade. The rights of the stallholders in the market place today date back to the rights established in medieval times.

Aylsham was once noted for its spa, situated about half a mile south of the town; it comprised a chalybeate spring, formerly used by those suffering from asthma and other chronic conditions.

==Local government==

In medieval times the parish of Aylsham was established as four manors, the main manor of Lancaster, Vicarage manor, Sexton&#x27;s manor and Bolwick manor. The ownership of the Lancaster manor changed hands many times, before James I assigned it to his son, the future Charles I.

In the course of the events which led up to the English Civil War Charles I had to raise as much money as possible, and mortgaged Lancaster manor to the Corporation of the City of London. The Corporation eventually sold it to Sir John Hobart, and through him it passed to the ownership of the Blickling Estate. The current lords of the manor are the National Trust.

Formerly part of the South Erpingham Hundred, Aylsham was, for administrative purposes, absorbed into St. Faith&#x27;s and Aylsham Rural District Council in 1894 and became part of Broadland District Council in 1974. Local issues come under the jurisdiction of Aylsham Town Council which is based at Aylsham Town Hall.


== Parish church ==

The Market Place and surrounding area is dominated by the tower of the parish church of St Michael and All Angels, a fine example of Gothic architecture of the Decorated style. The small spire on top of the 98 ft (30 metre) tower is also a landmark that can be seen for miles around. The nave, aisles and chancel were built in the 13th century. The tower and ground floor of the south porch were added in the 14th century. The north transept was built under the patronage of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster around 1380. An upper floor to the porch was added in 1488. The lower part of the rood screen survived the destruction visited by Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans, although some of the painted panels were disfigured.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Road transport for Aylsham was very important. It was the principal coaching point on the Norwich-Cromer road and the meeting point for other roads. Each day, the coaches from Cromer and Holt would draw up at the Black Boys, the main inn in Aylsham market place. Coaching ended with the coming of the railways in the 1880s.

The town is now located on the A140 road, a route which runs between Ipswich and Cromer, via Norwich.

===Buses===
The town is served by frequent bus services to Norwich and Sheringham (the X41, 43 and X44), operated by Sanders Coaches. Both the X41 and X44 continue on to Cromer and Sheringham, some of which connect with the Coasthopper services to Blakeney, Wells-next-the-Sea and Cromer. Other services serve surrounding villages and towns, including Wroxham, East Dereham, North Walsham and Felbrigg.

===Railways===
There were many different plans for railways, but eventually two lines served Aylsham, with the town having two railway stations. Aylsham South was on the Great Eastern line between County School (near North Elmham) and Wroxham. Aylsham North was on the M&amp;GNJR line from Melton Constable to Yarmouth. Both stations were closed in the 1950s.

Aylsham railway station is the northern terminus for the &quot;Bure Valley Railway&quot;, which was built on the site of Aylsham South station in 1990. The railway is a minimum gauge heritage railway which runs to Wroxham (); it is Norfolk&#x27;s longest railway of less than standard gauge.

Several long distance footpaths with a railway theme start or pass through the town:
* Bure Valley Path runs alongside the railway line from Aylsham to Wroxham;
* Marriott&#x27;s Way follows the old trackbed from Aylsham to Norwich, via the Themelthorpe Curve;
* Weaver&#x27;s Way; starting in Cromer, much of this route follows the trackbed of the former line to Yarmouth.

===Waterways===
The ancient but natural transport route for Aylsham would have been the River Bure, but it was not open to substantial navigation. There was a scheme in the 18th century to widen the navigation from Coltishall to Aylsham and, after many difficulties, trading wherries from Great Yarmouth were able to reach a staithe at Aylsham. The end for this scheme was the devastating flood of 1912.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Tacolneston TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk on 95.1 FM, Heart East on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly Radio Norwich 99.9) on 99.9 FM and Kiss on 106.1 FM. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;.

==Aylsham today==

Aylsham came fourth in the world in an international competition celebrating liveable communities, winning a Silver Award in category A (towns with a population up to 20,000) of the &quot;International Awards for Liveable Communities&quot;, held in La Coruña, Spain in November 2005.

The &quot;Market Towns Initiative&quot; finished in 2004, but the partnership successfully bid for funding to take part in the Cittaslow pilot project and to sustain work on traffic management and heritage. As a result, Aylsham became one of the founding towns and the first in Norfolk, of the Cittaslow movement, an international organisation promoting the concept of &#x27;Slow Towns&#x27; (&quot;a Network of towns where Quality of Life is important&quot;). It is claimed that Aylsham did not have to change to become a member, as it was already a clear example of the type of community advocated by the Cittaslow movement.

Local entertainment in the town includes concerts by the Aylsham Band, which plays at venues in and around Aylsham. The &quot;Aylsham Players&quot; host one or two productions a year and Aylsham High School presents an annual school musical.

Aylsham also lies on the Weaver&#x27;s Way which passes Blickling Hall; this is the great country house in the care of the National Trust, which is about a mile and a half (2 km) from Aylsham. With its dramatic symmetrical front, flanked by two great yew hedges, Blickling Hall is a fine example of a Jacobean brick-built manor house and was the home of the young Anne Boleyn.

The annual &quot;Aylsham Show&quot; features agricultural exhibits and takes place on August bank holiday Monday at nearby Blickling Park.

Aylsham Heritage Centre is located in a Victorian building within the grounds of St. Michael&#x27;s Church. Archives stored at the centre can be used to research the town&#x27;s past.

The town&#x27;s Tesco store was built from wood, recyclable plastic and other sustainable materials; it claimed to be the &quot;greenest in the world&quot; opened in the town July 2008.

==Notable residents==
Thomas Hudson, a glover of Aylsham, is recorded as one of the Protestant martyrs condemned to death for his faith under the reign of Queen Mary, towards the end of her reign. He was burnt at the stake at the Lollard&#x27;s Pit outside Bishopsgate, Norwich on 19 May 1558.

Sir Jerome Alexander (died 1670), a High Court judge in Ireland, noted for his exceptional severity, attended the local school c. 1600.

A plaque on the wall of Barclays Bank, now permanently closed, in the Market Place commemorates Christopher Layer (born 1683), who was a militant Jacobite and supporter of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the &#x27;Young Pretender&#x27;. He was tried for high treason and hanged at Tyburn in London in 1723. Nearby, a plaque commemorates Joseph Thomas Clover (1825–82), the father of modern anaesthetics, who was born above a shop overlooking the Market Place.

Daniel Defoe is thought to have stayed in Aylsham in 1723 during his journey through the eastern counties, and enjoyed a meal at the Black Boys Inn. Parson Woodforde, the famous Norfolk diarist, also dined there in 1781, and Horatio Nelson, whose cousin lived in Aylsham, is said to have danced in the Assembly Room attached to the inn.

Humphry Repton (1752–1818), the landscape gardener who lived at nearby Sustead, is buried in St Michael&#x27;s Churchyard, and his watercolours provide a fascinating record of the Market Place in the early 19th century.

The Reverend James Bulwer (1794-1879), the collector, naturalist, artist and conchologist, was born in Aylsham. 

Kathleen Starling (1890–ca 1970) became an opera singer under the name of Kathleen Destournel. She sang at Covent Garden and entertained troops in North Africa during the Second World War, before moving to Arizona, USA until her husband&#x27;s death after which she returned to Aylsham to live with her sisters.

Clive Payne (1950–), former professional footballer for Norwich City and AFC Bournemouth was born in Aylsham.

Nick Youngs (1959–) and his two sons, Ben (1989–) and Tom Youngs (1987–) were both brought up close to the town on their father&#x27;s farm. Youngs is a former rugby union player for Leicester and England. Both sons went on to represent the national rugby union team. The Youngs brothers gifted land for a new sports ground to be built in the town.

<doc id="145018" wikidata="Q2477687" url="?curid=145018" title="Ultrafinitism">
<text>In the philosophy of mathematics, ultrafinitism (also known as ultraintuitionism, strict formalism, strict finitism, actualism, predicativism, and strong finitism) is a form of finitism and intuitionism. There are various philosophies of mathematics that are called ultrafinitism. A major identifying property common among most of these philosophies is their objections to totality of number theoretic functions like exponentiation over natural numbers.

==Main ideas==
Like other finitists, ultrafinitists deny the existence of the infinite set formula_1 of natural numbers, on the basis that it can never be completed (i.e., there is a largest natural number).

In addition, some ultrafinitists are concerned with acceptance of objects in mathematics that no one can construct in practice because of physical restrictions in constructing large finite mathematical objects.
Thus some ultrafinitists will deny or refrain from accepting the existence of large numbers, for example, the floor of the first Skewes&#x27;s number, which is a huge number defined using the exponential function as exp(exp(exp(79))), or
: formula_2
The reason is that nobody has yet calculated what natural number is the floor of this real number, and it may not even be physically possible to do so. Similarly, formula_3 (in Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation) would be considered only a formal expression that does not correspond to a natural number. The brand of ultrafinitism concerned with physical realizability of mathematics is often called actualism.

Edward Nelson criticized the classical conception of natural numbers because of the circularity of its definition. In classical mathematics the natural numbers are defined as 0 and numbers obtained by the iterative applications of the successor function to 0. But the concept of natural number is already assumed for the iteration. In other words, to obtain a number like formula_3 one needs to perform the successor function iteratively (in fact, exactly formula_3 times) to 0.

Some versions of ultrafinitism are forms of constructivism, but most constructivists view the philosophy as unworkably extreme. The logical foundation of ultrafinitism is unclear; in his comprehensive survey &quot;Constructivism in Mathematics&quot; (1988), the constructive logician A. S. Troelstra dismissed it by saying &quot;no satisfactory development exists at present.&quot; This was not so much a philosophical objection as it was an admission that, in a rigorous work of mathematical logic, there was simply nothing precise enough to include.

== People associated with ultrafinitism ==
Serious work on ultrafinitism was led, from 1959 until his death in 2016, by Alexander Esenin-Volpin, who in 1961 sketched a program for proving the consistency of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in ultrafinite mathematics. Other mathematicians who have worked in the topic include Doron Zeilberger, Edward Nelson, Rohit Jivanlal Parikh, and Jean Paul Van Bendegem. The philosophy is also sometimes associated with the beliefs of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Robin Gandy, Petr Vopěnka, and Johannes Hjelmslev.

Shaughan Lavine has developed a form of set-theoretical ultrafinitism that is consistent with classical mathematics.
Lavine has shown that the basic principles of arithmetic such as &quot;there is no largest natural number&quot; can be upheld, as Lavine allows for the inclusion of &quot;indefinitely large&quot; numbers.

== Computational complexity theory based restrictions ==
Other considerations of the possibility of avoiding unwieldy large numbers can be based on computational complexity theory, as in András Kornai&#x27;s work on explicit finitism (which does not deny the existence of large numbers) and Vladimir Sazonov&#x27;s notion of feasible numbers.

There has also been considerable formal development on versions of ultrafinitism that are based on complexity theory, like Samuel Buss&#x27;s bounded arithmetic theories, which capture mathematics associated with various complexity classes like P and PSPACE. Buss&#x27;s work can be considered the continuation of Edward Nelson&#x27;s work on predicative arithmetic as bounded arithmetic theories like S12 are interpretable in Raphael Robinson&#x27;s theory Q and therefore are predicative in Nelson&#x27;s sense. The power of these theories for developing mathematics is studied in bounded reverse mathematics as can be found in the works of Stephen A. Cook and Phuong The Nguyen. However these are not philosophies of mathematics but rather the study of restricted forms of reasoning similar to reverse mathematics.

<doc id="145020" wikidata="Q844613" url="?curid=145020" title="Sintering">
<text>Sintering or frittage is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of material by pressure or heat without melting it to the point of liquefaction. Sintering happens as part of a manufacturing process used with metals, ceramics, plastics, and other materials. The atoms/molecules in the sintered material diffuse across the boundaries of the particles, fusing the particles together and creating a solid piece.

Since the sintering temperature does not have to reach the melting point of the material, sintering is often chosen as the shaping process for materials with extremely high melting points, such as tungsten and molybdenum. The study of sintering in metallurgical powder-related processes is known as powder metallurgy.

An example of sintering can be observed when ice cubes in a glass of water adhere to each other, which is driven by the temperature difference between the water and the ice. Examples of pressure-driven sintering are the compacting of snowfall to a glacier, or the formation of a hard snowball by pressing loose snow together.

The material produced by sintering is called &quot;sinter&quot;. The word &quot;sinter&quot; comes from the Middle High German , a cognate of English &quot;&quot;.

== General sintering ==
Sintering is generally considered successful when the process reduces porosity and enhances properties such as strength, electrical conductivity, translucency and thermal conductivity. In some special cases, sintering is carefully applied to enhance the strength of a material while preserving porosity (e.g. in filters or catalysts, where gas adsorption is a priority). During the sintering process, atomic diffusion drives powder surface elimination in different stages, starting at the formation of necks between powders to final elimination of small pores at the end of the process.
The driving force for densification is the change in free energy from the decrease in surface area and lowering of the surface free energy by the replacement of solid-vapor interfaces. It forms new but lower-energy solid-solid interfaces with a net decrease in total free energy. On a microscopic scale, material transfer is affected by the change in pressure and differences in free energy across the curved surface. If the size of the particle is small (and its curvature is high), these effects become very large in magnitude. The change in energy is much higher when the radius of curvature is less than a few micrometers, which is one of the main reasons why much ceramic technology is based on the use of fine-particle materials.

The ratio of bond area to particle size is a determining factor for properties such as strength and electrical conductivity. To yield the desired bond area, temperature and initial grain size are precisely controlled over the sintering process. At steady state, the particle radius and the vapor pressure are proportional to (p0)2/3 and to (p0)1/3, respectively.

The source of power for solid-state processes is the change in free or chemical potential energy between the neck and the surface of the particle. This energy creates a transfer of material through the fastest means possible; if transfer were to take place from the particle volume or the grain boundary between particles, particle count would decrease and pores would be destroyed. Pore elimination is fastest in samples with many pores of uniform size because the boundary diffusion distance is smallest. During the latter portions of the process, boundary and lattice diffusion from the boundary become important.

Control of temperature is very important to the sintering process, since grain-boundary diffusion and volume diffusion rely heavily upon temperature, particle size, particle distribution, material composition, and often other properties of the sintering environment itself.

== Ceramic sintering ==

Sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of pottery and other ceramic objects. Sintering and vitrification (which requires higher temperatures) are the two main mechanisms behind the strength and stability of ceramics. Sintered ceramic objects are made from substances such as glass, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium oxide, and ferric oxide. Some ceramic raw materials have a lower affinity for water and a lower plasticity index than clay, requiring organic additives in the stages before sintering.

Sintering begins when sufficient temperatures have been reached to mobilize the active elements in the ceramic material, which can start below their melting point (typically at 50–80% of their melting point), e.g. as premelting. When sufficient sintering has taken place, the ceramic body will no longer break down in water; additional sintering can reduce the porosity of the ceramic, increase the bond area between ceramic particles, and increase the material strength.

Industrial procedures to create ceramic objects via sintering of powders generally include:

* mixing water, binder, deflocculant, and unfired ceramic powder to form a slurry
*spray-drying the slurry
* putting the spray dried powder into a mold and pressing it to form a green body (an unsintered ceramic item)
* heating the green body at low temperature to burn off the binder
* sintering at a high temperature to fuse the ceramic particles together.

All the characteristic temperatures associated with phase transformation, glass transitions, and melting points, occurring during a sinterisation cycle of a particular ceramic&#x27;s formulation (i.e., tails and frits) can be easily obtained by observing the expansion-temperature curves during optical dilatometer thermal analysis. In fact, sinterisation is associated with a remarkable shrinkage of the material because glass phases flow once their transition temperature is reached, and start consolidating the powdery structure and considerably reducing the porosity of the material.

Sintering is performed at high temperature. Additionally, a second and/or third external force (such as pressure, electric current) could be used. A commonly used second external force is pressure. Sintering performed by only heating is generally termed &quot;pressureless sintering&quot;, which is possible with graded metal-ceramic composites, utilising a nanoparticle sintering aid and bulk molding technology. A variant used for 3D shapes is called hot isostatic pressing.

To allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and to prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic powder separator sheets. These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are additionally categorized by fine, medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while maximizing furnace loading.

== Sintering of metallic powders ==
Most, if not all, metals can be sintered. This applies especially to pure metals produced in vacuum which suffer no surface contamination. Sintering under atmospheric pressure requires the use of a protective gas, quite often endothermic gas. Sintering, with subsequent reworking, can produce a great range of material properties. Changes in density, alloying, and heat treatments can alter the physical characteristics of various products. For instance, the Young&#x27;s modulus &quot;En&quot; of sintered iron powders remains somewhat insensitive to sintering time, alloying, or particle size in the original powder for lower sintering temperatures, but depends upon the density of the final product:

formula_1
where &quot;D&quot; is the density, &quot;E&quot; is Young&#x27;s modulus and &quot;d&quot; is the maximum density of iron.

Sintering is static when a metal powder under certain external conditions may exhibit coalescence, and yet reverts to its normal behavior when such conditions are removed. In most cases, the density of a collection of grains increases as material flows into voids, causing a decrease in overall volume. Mass movements that occur during sintering consist of the reduction of total porosity by repacking, followed by material transport due to evaporation and condensation from diffusion. In the final stages, metal atoms move along crystal boundaries to the walls of internal pores, redistributing mass from the internal bulk of the object and smoothing pore walls. Surface tension is the driving force for this movement.

A special form of sintering (which is still considered part of powder metallurgy) is liquid-state sintering in which at least one but not all elements are in a liquid state. Liquid-state sintering is required for making cemented carbide and tungsten carbide.

Sintered bronze in particular is frequently used as a material for bearings, since its porosity allows lubricants to flow through it or remain captured within it. Sintered copper may be used as a wicking structure in certain types of heat pipe construction, where the porosity allows a liquid agent to move through the porous material via capillary action. For materials that have high melting points such as molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, tantalum, osmium and carbon, sintering is one of the few viable manufacturing processes. In these cases, very low porosity is desirable and can often be achieved.

Sintered metal powder is used to make frangible shotgun shells called breaching rounds, as used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. These shotgun shells are designed to destroy door deadbolts, locks and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door. They work by destroying the object they hit and then dispersing into a relatively harmless powder.

Sintered bronze and stainless steel are used as filter materials in applications requiring high temperature resistance while retaining the ability to regenerate the filter element. For example, sintered stainless steel elements are employed for filtering steam in food and pharmaceutical applications, and sintered bronze in aircraft hydraulic systems.

Sintering of powders containing precious metals such as silver and gold is used to make small jewelry items. Evaporative self-assembly of colloidal silver nanocubes into supercrystals has been shown to allow the sintering of electrical joints at temperatures lower than 200 °C.

===Advantages===
Particular advantages of the powder technology include:

# Very high levels of purity and uniformity in starting materials
# Preservation of purity, due to the simpler subsequent fabrication process (fewer steps) that it makes possible
# Stabilization of the details of repetitive operations, by control of grain size during the input stages
# Absence of binding contact between segregated powder particles – or &quot;inclusions&quot; (called stringering) – as often occurs in melting processes
# No deformation needed to produce directional elongation of grains
# Capability to produce materials of controlled, uniform porosity.
# Capability to produce nearly net-shaped objects.
# Capability to produce materials which cannot be produced by any other technology.
# Capability to fabricate high-strength material like turbine blades.
# After sintering the mechanical strength to handling becomes higher.

The literature contains many references on sintering dissimilar materials to produce solid/solid-phase compounds or solid/melt mixtures at the processing stage. Almost any substance can be obtained in powder form, through either chemical, mechanical or physical processes, so basically any material can be obtained through sintering. When pure elements are sintered, the leftover powder is still pure, so it can be recycled.

=== Disadvantages ===
Particular disadvantages of the powder technology include:
# sintering cannot create uniform sizes
# micro- and nanostructures produced before sintering are often destroyed.

== Plastics sintering ==
Plastic materials are formed by sintering for applications that require materials of specific porosity. Sintered plastic porous components are used in filtration and to control fluid and gas flows. Sintered plastics are used in applications requiring caustic fluid separation processes such as the nibs in whiteboard markers, inhaler filters, and vents for caps and liners on packaging materials. Sintered ultra high molecular weight polyethylene materials are used as ski and snowboard base materials. The porous texture allows wax to be retained within the structure of the base material, thus providing a more durable wax coating.

== Liquid phase sintering ==
For materials that are difficult to sinter, a process called liquid phase sintering is commonly used. Materials for which liquid phase sintering is common are Si3N4, WC, SiC, and more. Liquid phase sintering is the process of adding an additive to the powder which will melt before the matrix phase. The process of liquid phase sintering has three stages:

*rearrangement – As the liquid melts capillary action will pull the liquid into pores and also cause grains to rearrange into a more favorable packing arrangement.
*solution-precipitation – In areas where capillary pressures are high (particles are close together) atoms will preferentially go into solution and then precipitate in areas of lower chemical potential where particles are not close or in contact. This is called contact flattening. This densifies the system in a way similar to grain boundary diffusion in solid state sintering. Ostwald ripening will also occur where smaller particles will go into solution preferentially and precipitate on larger particles leading to densification.
*final densification – densification of solid skeletal network, liquid movement from efficiently packed regions into pores.

For liquid phase sintering to be practical the major phase should be at least slightly soluble in the liquid phase and the additive should melt before any major sintering of the solid particulate network occurs, otherwise rearrangement of grains will not occur. Liquid phase sintering was successfully applied to improve grain growth of thin semiconductor layers from nanoparticle precursor films.

== Electric current assisted sintering ==
These techniques employ electric currents to drive or enhance sintering. English engineer A. G. Bloxam registered in 1906 the first patent on sintering powders using direct current in vacuum. The primary purpose of his inventions was the industrial scale production of filaments for incandescent lamps by compacting tungsten or molybdenum particles. The applied current was particularly effective in reducing surface oxides that increased the emissivity of the filaments.

In 1913, Weintraub and Rush patented a modified sintering method which combined electric current with pressure. The benefits of this method were proved for the sintering of refractory metals as well as conductive carbide or nitride powders. The starting boron–carbon or silicon–carbon powders were placed in an electrically insulating tube and compressed by two rods which also served as electrodes for the current. The estimated sintering temperature was 2000 °C.

In the United States, sintering was first patented by Duval d&#x27;Adrian in 1922. His three-step process aimed at producing heat-resistant blocks from such oxide materials as zirconia, thoria or tantalia. The steps were: (i) molding the powder; (ii) annealing it at about 2500 °C to make it conducting; (iii) applying current-pressure sintering as in the method by Weintraub and Rush.

Sintering that uses an arc produced via a capacitance discharge to eliminate oxides before direct current heating, was patented by G. F. Taylor in 1932. This originated sintering methods employing pulsed or alternating current, eventually superimposed to a direct current. Those techniques have been developed over many decades and summarized in more than 640 patents.

Of these technologies the most well known is resistance sintering (also called hot pressing) and spark plasma sintering, while electro sinter forging is the latest advancement in this field.

=== Spark plasma sintering ===
In spark plasma sintering (SPS), external pressure and an electric field are applied simultaneously to enhance the densification of the metallic/ceramic powder compacts. However, after commercialization it was determined there is no plasma, so the proper name is spark sintering as coined by Lenel. The electric field driven densification supplements sintering with a form of hot pressing, to enable lower temperatures and taking less time than typical sintering. For a number of years, it was speculated that the existence of sparks or plasma between particles could aid sintering; however, Hulbert and coworkers systematically proved that the electric parameters used during spark plasma sintering make it (highly) unlikely. In light of this, the name &quot;spark plasma sintering&quot; has been rendered obsolete. Terms such as field assisted sintering technique (FAST), electric field assisted sintering (EFAS), and direct current sintering (DCS) have been implemented by the sintering community. Using a direct current (DC) pulse as the electric current, spark plasma, spark impact pressure, joule heating, and an electrical field diffusion effect would be created. By modifying the graphite die design and its assembly, it is possible to perform pressureless sintering in spark plasma sintering facility. This modified die design setup is reported to synergize the advantages of both conventional pressureless sintering and spark plasma sintering techniques.

=== Electro sinter forging ===
Electro sinter forging is an electric current assisted sintering (ECAS) technology originated from capacitor discharge sintering. It is used for the production of diamond metal matrix composites and is under evaluation for the production of hard metals, nitinol and other metals and intermetallics. It is characterized by a very low sintering time, allowing machines to sinter at the same speed as a compaction press.

== Pressureless sintering ==
Pressureless sintering is the sintering of a powder compact (sometimes at very high temperatures, depending on the powder) without applied pressure. This avoids density variations in the final component, which occurs with more traditional hot pressing methods.

The powder compact (if a ceramic) can be created by slip casting, injection moulding, and cold isostatic pressing. After presintering, the final green compact can be machined to its final shape before being sintered.

Three different heating schedules can be performed with pressureless sintering: constant-rate of heating (CRH), rate-controlled sintering (RCS), and two-step sintering (TSS). The microstructure and grain size of the ceramics may vary depending on the material and method used.

Constant-rate of heating (CRH), also known as temperature-controlled sintering, consists of heating the green compact at a constant rate up to the sintering temperature. Experiments with zirconia have been performed to optimize the sintering temperature and sintering rate for CRH method. Results showed that the grain sizes were identical when the samples were sintered to the same density, proving that grain size is a function of specimen density rather than CRH temperature mode.

In rate-controlled sintering (RCS), the densification rate in the open-porosity phase is lower than in the CRH method. By definition, the relative density, ρrel, in the open-porosity phase is lower than 90%. Although this should prevent separation of pores from grain boundaries, it has been proven statistically that RCS did not produce smaller grain sizes than CRH for alumina, zirconia, and ceria samples.

Two-step sintering (TSS) uses two different sintering temperatures. The first sintering temperature should guarantee a relative density higher than 75% of theoretical sample density. This will remove supercritical pores from the body. The sample will then be cooled down and held at the second sintering temperature until densification is completed. Grains of cubic zirconia and cubic strontium titanate were significantly refined by TSS compared to CRH. However, the grain size changes in other ceramic materials, like tetragonal zirconia and hexagonal alumina, were not statistically significant.

== Microwave sintering ==
In microwave sintering, heat is sometimes generated internally within the material, rather than via surface radiative heat transfer from an external heat source. Some materials fail to couple and others exhibit run-away behavior, so it is restricted in usefulness. A benefit of microwave sintering is faster heating for small loads, meaning less time is needed to reach the sintering temperature, less heating energy is required and there are improvements in the product properties.

A failing of microwave sintering is that it generally sinters only one compact at a time, so overall productivity turns out to be poor except for situations involving one of a kind sintering, such as for artists. As microwaves can only penetrate a short distance in materials with a high conductivity and a high permeability, microwave sintering requires the sample to be delivered in powders with a particle size around the penetration depth of microwaves in the particular material. The sintering process and side-reactions run several times faster during microwave sintering at the same temperature, which results in different properties for the sintered product.

This technique is acknowledged to be quite effective in maintaining fine grains/nano sized grains in sintered bioceramics. Magnesium phosphates and calcium phosphates are the examples which have been processed through the microwave sintering technique.

== Densification, vitrification and grain growth ==
Sintering in practice is the control of both densification and grain growth. Densification is the act of reducing porosity in a sample, thereby making it denser. Grain growth is the process of grain boundary motion and Ostwald ripening to increase the average grain size. Many properties (mechanical strength, electrical breakdown strength, etc.) benefit from both a high relative density and a small grain size. Therefore, being able to control these properties during processing is of high technical importance. Since densification of powders requires high temperatures, grain growth naturally occurs during sintering. Reduction of this process is key for many engineering ceramics. Under certain conditions of chemistry and orientation, some grains may grow rapidly at the expense of their neighbours during sintering. This phenomenon, known as abnormal grain growth (AGG), results in a bimodal grain size distribution that has consequences for the mechanical, dielectric and thermal performance of the sintered material.

For densification to occur at a quick pace it is essential to have (1) an amount of liquid phase that is large in size, (2) a near complete solubility of the solid in the liquid, and (3) wetting of the solid by the liquid. The power behind the densification is derived from the capillary pressure of the liquid phase located between the fine solid particles. When the liquid phase wets the solid particles, each space between the particles becomes a capillary in which a substantial capillary pressure is developed. For submicrometre particle sizes, capillaries with diameters in the range of 0.1 to 1 micrometres develop pressures in the range of to for silicate liquids and in the range of to for a metal such as liquid cobalt.

Densification requires constant capillary pressure where just solution-precipitation material transfer would not produce densification. For further densification, additional particle movement while the particle undergoes grain-growth and grain-shape changes occurs. Shrinkage would result when the liquid slips between particles and increases pressure at points of contact causing the material to move away from the contact areas, forcing particle centers to draw near each other.

The sintering of liquid-phase materials involves a fine-grained solid phase to create the needed capillary pressures proportional to its diameter, and the liquid concentration must also create the required capillary pressure within range, else the process ceases. The vitrification rate is dependent upon the pore size, the viscosity and amount of liquid phase present leading to the viscosity of the overall composition, and the surface tension. Temperature dependence for densification controls the process because at higher temperatures viscosity decreases and increases liquid content. Therefore, when changes to the composition and processing are made, it will affect the vitrification process.

=== Sintering mechanisms ===
Sintering occurs by diffusion of atoms through the microstructure. This diffusion is caused by a gradient of chemical potential – atoms move from an area of higher chemical potential to an area of lower chemical potential. The different paths the atoms take to get from one spot to another are the &quot;sintering mechanisms&quot; or &quot;matter transport mechanisms&quot;.

In solid state sintering, the six common mechanisms are:

# surface diffusion – diffusion of atoms along the surface of a particle
# vapor transport – evaporation of atoms which condense on a different surface
# lattice diffusion from surface – atoms from surface diffuse through lattice
# lattice diffusion from grain boundary – atom from grain boundary diffuses through lattice
# grain boundary diffusion – atoms diffuse along grain boundary
# plastic deformation – dislocation motion causes flow of matter.

Mechanisms 1–3 above are non-densifying (i.e. do not cause the pores and the overall ceramic body to shrink) but can still increase the area of the bond or &quot;neck&quot; between grains; they take atoms from the surface and rearrange them onto another surface or part of the same surface. Mechanisms 4–6 are densifying – atoms are moved from the bulk material or the grain boundaries to the surface of pores, thereby eliminating porosity and increasing the density of the sample.

=== Grain growth ===
A grain boundary (GB) is the transition area or interface between adjacent crystallites (or grains) of the same chemical and lattice composition, not to be confused with a phase boundary. The adjacent grains do not have the same orientation of the lattice, thus giving the atoms in GB shifted positions relative to the lattice in the crystals. Due to the shifted positioning of the atoms in the GB they have a higher energy state when compared with the atoms in the crystal lattice of the grains. It is this imperfection that makes it possible to selectively etch the GBs when one wants the microstructure to be visible.

Striving to minimize its energy leads to the coarsening of the microstructure to reach a metastable state within the specimen. This involves minimizing its GB area and changing its topological structure to minimize its energy. This grain growth can either be normal or abnormal, a normal grain growth is characterized by the uniform growth and size of all the grains in the specimen. Abnormal grain growth is when a few grains grow much larger than the remaining majority.

==== Grain boundary energy/tension ====
The atoms in the GB are normally in a higher energy state than their equivalent in the bulk material. This is due to their more stretched bonds, which gives rise to a GB tension formula_2. This extra energy that the atoms possess is called the grain boundary energy, formula_3. The grain will want to minimize this extra energy, thus striving to make the grain boundary area smaller and this change requires energy.

&quot;Or, in other words, a force has to be applied, in the plane of the grain boundary and acting along a line in the grain-boundary area, in order to extend the grain-boundary area in the direction of the force. The force per unit length, i.e. tension/stress, along the line mentioned is σGB. On the basis of this reasoning it would follow that:

formula_4

with dA as the increase of grain-boundary area per unit length along the line in the grain-boundary area considered.&quot;[pg 478]

The GB tension can also be thought of as the attractive forces between the atoms at the surface and the tension between these atoms is due to the fact that there is a larger interatomic distance between them at the surface compared to the bulk (i.e. surface tension). When the surface area becomes bigger the bonds stretch more and the GB tension increases. To counteract this increase in tension there must be a transport of atoms to the surface keeping the GB tension constant. This diffusion of atoms accounts for the constant surface tension in liquids. Then the argument,

formula_4

holds true. For solids, on the other hand, diffusion of atoms to the surface might not be sufficient and the surface tension can vary with an increase in surface area.

For a solid, one can derive an expression for the change in Gibbs free energy, dG, upon the change of GB area, dA. dG is given by
formula_6

which gives
formula_7

formula_2 is normally expressed in units of formula_9 while formula_3 is normally expressed in units of formula_11 formula_12 since they are different physical properties.

==== Mechanical equilibrium ====
In a two-dimensional isotropic material the grain boundary tension would be the same for the grains. This would give angle of 120° at GB junction where three grains meet. This would give the structure a hexagonal pattern which is the metastable state (or mechanical equilibrium) of the 2D specimen. A consequence of this is that, to keep trying to be as close to the equilibrium as possible, grains with fewer sides than six will bend the GB to try keep the 120° angle between each other. This results in a curved boundary with its curvature towards itself. A grain with six sides will, as mentioned, have straight boundaries, while a grain with more than six sides will have curved boundaries with its curvature away from itself. A grain with six boundaries (i.e. hexagonal structure) is in a metastable state (i.e. local equilibrium) within the 2D structure. In three dimensions structural details are similar but much more complex and the metastable structure for a grain is a non-regular 14-sided polyhedra with doubly curved faces. In practice all arrays of grains are always unstable and thus always grow until prevented by a counterforce.

Grains strive to minimize their energy, and a curved boundary has a higher energy than a straight boundary. This means that the grain boundary will migrate towards the curvature. The consequence of this is that grains with less than 6 sides will decrease in size while grains with more than 6 sides will increase in size.

Grain growth occurs due to motion of atoms across a grain boundary. Convex surfaces have a higher chemical potential than concave surfaces, therefore grain boundaries will move toward their center of curvature. As smaller particles tend to have a higher radius of curvature and this results in smaller grains losing atoms to larger grains and shrinking. This is a process called Ostwald ripening. Large grains grow at the expense of small grains.

Grain growth in a simple model is found to follow:
formula_13

Here &quot;G&quot; is final average grain size, &quot;G0&quot; is the initial average grain size, &quot;t&quot; is time, &quot;m&quot; is a factor between 2 and 4, and &quot;K&quot; is a factor given by:
formula_14

Here &quot;Q&quot; is the molar activation energy, &quot;R&quot; is the ideal gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature, and &quot;K0&quot; is a material dependent factor. In most materials the sintered grain size is proportional to the inverse square root of the fractional porosity, implying that pores are the most effective retardant for grain growth during sintering.

=== Reducing grain growth ===

==== Solute ions ====
If a dopant is added to the material (example: Nd in BaTiO3) the impurity will tend to stick to the grain boundaries. As the grain boundary tries to move (as atoms jump from the convex to concave surface) the change in concentration of the dopant at the grain boundary will impose a drag on the boundary. The original concentration of solute around the grain boundary will be asymmetrical in most cases. As the grain boundary tries to move, the concentration on the side opposite of motion will have a higher concentration and therefore have a higher chemical potential. This increased chemical potential will act as a backforce to the original chemical potential gradient that is the reason for grain boundary movement. This decrease in net chemical potential will decrease the grain boundary velocity and therefore grain growth.

==== Fine second phase particles ====
If particles of a second phase which are insoluble in the matrix phase are added to the powder in the form of a much finer powder, then this will decrease grain boundary movement. When the grain boundary tries to move past the inclusion diffusion of atoms from one grain to the other, it will be hindered by the insoluble particle. This is because it is beneficial for particles to reside in the grain boundaries and they exert a force in opposite direction compared to grain boundary migration. This effect is called the Zener effect after the man who estimated this drag force to

formula_15
where r is the radius of the particle and λ the interfacial energy of the boundary if there are N particles per unit volume their volume fraction f is
formula_16

assuming they are randomly distributed. A boundary of unit area will intersect all particles within a volume of 2r which is 2Nr particles. So the number of particles n intersecting a unit area of grain boundary is:

formula_17

Now, assuming that the grains only grow due to the influence of curvature, the driving force of growth is formula_18 where (for homogeneous grain structure) R approximates to the mean diameter of the grains. With this the critical diameter that has to be reached before the grains ceases to grow:

formula_19
This can be reduced to
formula_20

so the critical diameter of the grains is dependent on the size and volume fraction of the particles at the grain boundaries.

It has also been shown that small bubbles or cavities can act as inclusion

More complicated interactions which slow grain boundary motion include interactions of the surface energies of the two grains and the inclusion and are discussed in detail by C.S. Smith.

==Sintering of catalysts==
Sintering is an important cause for loss of catalytic activity, especially on supported metal catalysts. It decreases the surface area of the catalyst and changes the surface structure. For a porous catalytic surface, the pores may collapse due to sintering, resulting in loss of surface area. Sintering is in general an irreversible process.

Small catalyst particles have the highest possible relative surface area and high reaction temperature, both factors that generally increase the reactivity of a catalyst. However, these factors are also the circumstances under which sintering occurs. Specific materials may also increase the rate of sintering. On the other hand, by alloying catalysts with other materials, sintering can be reduced. Rare-earth metals in particular have been shown to reduce sintering of metal catalysts when alloyed.

For many supported metal catalysts, sintering starts to become a significant effect at temperatures over . Catalysts that operate at higher temperatures, such as a car catalyst, use structural improvements to reduce or prevent sintering. These improvements are in general in the form of a support made from an inert and thermally stable material such as silica, carbon or alumina.

<doc id="145023" wikidata="Q1066303" url="?curid=145023" title="Spray drying">
<text>Spray drying is a method of forming a dry powder from a liquid or slurry by rapidly drying with a hot gas. This is the preferred method of drying of many thermally-sensitive materials such as foods and pharmaceuticals, or materials which may require extremely consistent, fine particle size. Air is most commonly used as the heated drying medium; however, nitrogen may be used if the liquid is flammable (such as ethanol) or if the product is oxygen-sensitive.

All spray dryers use some type of atomizer or spray nozzle to disperse the liquid or slurry into a controlled drop size spray. The most common of these are rotary disk and single-fluid high pressure swirl nozzles. Atomizer wheels are known to provide broader particle size distribution, but both methods allow for consistent distribution of particle size. Alternatively, for some applications two-fluid or ultrasonic nozzles are used. Depending on the process requirements, drop sizes from 10 to 500 μm can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The most common applications are in the 100 to 200 μm diameter range. The dry powder is often free-flowing.

The most common type of spray dryers are called single effect. There is a single source of drying air at the top of the chamber (see n°4 on the diagram). In most cases the air is blown in the same direction as the sprayed liquid (co-current). A fine powder is produced, but it can have poor flowability and causes a lot of dust. To overcome the dust issues and poor flowability of the powder, a new generation of spray dryers called multiple effect spray dryers have been developed. Instead of drying the liquid in one stage, drying is done through two steps: the first at the top (as per single effect) and the second with an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. The bed provides a humid environment which causes smaller particles to clump, producing more uniform particle sizes, usually within the range of 100 to 300 μm. These powders are free-flowing due to the larger particle size.

The fine powders generated by the first stage drying can be recycled in continuous flow either at the top of the chamber (around the sprayed liquid) or at the bottom, inside the integrated fluidized bed.
The drying of the powder can be finalized on an external vibrating fluidized bed.

The hot drying gas can be passed in as a co-current, same direction as sprayed liquid atomizer, or counter-current, where the hot air flows against the flow from the atomizer. With co-current flow, particles spend less time in the system and the particle separator (typically a cyclone device). With counter-current flow, particles spend more time in the system and is usually paired with a fluidized bed system. Co-current flow generally allows the system to operate more efficiently.

Alternatives to spray dryers are:
#Freeze dryer: a more-expensive batch process for products that degrade in spray drying. Dry product is not free-flowing.
#Drum dryer: a less-expensive continuous process for low-value products; creates flakes instead of free-flowing powder.
#Pulse combustion dryer: A less-expensive continuous process that can handle higher viscosities and solids loading than a spray dryer, and sometimes yields a freeze-dry quality powder that is free-flowing.

== History ==
The spray drying technique was first described in 1860 with the first spray dryer instrument patented by Samuel Percy in 1872. With time, the spray drying method grew in popularity, at first mainly for milk production in the 1920s and during World War II, when there was a need to reduce the weight and volume of food and other materials. In the second half of the 20th century, commercialization of spray dryers increased, as did the number of spray drying applications. 

==Spray dryer==
A spray dryer takes a liquid stream and separates the solute or suspension as a solid and the solvent into a vapor. The solid is usually collected in a drum or cyclone. The liquid input stream is sprayed through a nozzle into a hot vapor stream and vaporized. Solids form as moisture quickly leaves the droplets. A nozzle is usually used to make the droplets as small as possible, maximizing surface area hence heat transfer and the rate of water vaporization. Droplet sizes can range from 20 to 180 μm depending on the nozzle.
There are two main types of nozzles: high pressure single fluid nozzle (50 to 300 bars) and two-fluid nozzles: one fluid is the liquid to dry and the second is compressed gas (generally air at 1 to 7 bars).

Spray dryers can dry a product very quickly compared to other methods of drying. They also turn a solution (or slurry) into a dried powder in a single step, which simplifies the process and improves profit margins.

In pharmaceutical manufacturing, spray drying is employed to manufacture Amorphous Solid Dispersions, by uniformly dispersing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients into a polymer matrix. This state will put the active compounds (drug) in a higher state of energy which in turn facilitates diffusion of drug species in patient body.

==Micro-encapsulation==
Spray drying often is used as an encapsulation technique by the food and other industries. A substance to be encapsulated (the load) and an amphipathic carrier (usually some sort of modified starch) are homogenized as a suspension in water (the slurry). The slurry is then fed into a spray drier, usually a tower heated to temperatures above the boiling point of water.

As the slurry enters the tower, it is atomized. Partly because of the high surface tension of water and partly because of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions between the amphipathic carrier, the water, and the load, the atomized slurry forms micelles. The small size of the drops (averaging 100 micrometers in diameter) results in a relatively large surface area which dries quickly. As the water dries, the carrier forms a hardened shell around the load.

Load loss is usually a function of molecular weight. That is, lighter molecules tend to boil off in larger quantities at the processing temperatures. Loss is minimized industrially by spraying into taller towers. A larger volume of air has a lower average humidity as the process proceeds. By the osmosis principle, water will be encouraged by its difference in fugacities in the vapor and liquid phases to leave the micelles and enter the air. Therefore, the same percentage of water can be dried out of the particles at lower temperatures if larger towers are used. Alternatively, the slurry can be sprayed into a partial vacuum. Since the boiling point of a solvent is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the ambient pressure, reducing pressure in the tower has the effect of lowering the boiling point of the solvent.

The application of the spray drying encapsulation technique is to prepare &quot;dehydrated&quot; powders of substances which do not have any water to dehydrate. For example, instant drink mixes are spray dries of the various chemicals which make up the beverage. The technique was once used to remove water from food products. One example is the preparation of dehydrated milk. Because the milk was not being encapsulated and because spray drying causes thermal degradation, milk dehydration and similar processes have been replaced by other dehydration techniques. Skim milk powders are still widely produced using spray drying technology, typically at high solids concentration for maximum drying efficiency. Thermal degradation of products can be overcome by using lower operating temperatures and larger chamber sizes for increased residence times.

Recent research is now suggesting that the use of spray-drying techniques may be an alternative method for crystallization of amorphous powders during the drying process since the temperature effects on the amorphous powders may be significant depending on drying residence times.

== Designing particle shape and size ==
The spray drying process contains a variety of input parameters that can alter the shape and size of yielded particles. 

Common input parameters:

# Solution Concentration 
# Drying Gas Flow
# Inlet Temperature
# Spraying Gas Flow
# Feed Rate

From the following input parameters comes a series of pathways a particle can take towards its yielded shape and size. Certain parameters like spraying gas flow, feed rate, and the solution concentration heavily influence the yielded particle size, whereas the inlet temperature plays a significant role into the shape of the particle at the end. Particle size has a great correlation with the original size of the solution droplet from the atomizer, so the greatest way to control particle size can be done by heavily saturating the solution and making the initial droplet larger or smaller. Once the initial droplet enters the drying chamber, the droplet can continue to crust formation, or no particle will be formed. From the crust formation, the temperature of the drying process and duration of the particle in the drying process can lead the particle toward a dry shell or a deformed particle. The dry shell can proceed into a solid particle or a shattered particle. The crust formation can also forgo the dry shell or deformed particle if the drying conditions are not correct and undergo an internal bubble nucleation with another series of pathways. 

The current understanding of the drying conditions varies between different spray drying configurations and solution contents, but more research is being completed into the determination of what drives each particle shape pathways as future applications in pharmaceutical and industrial areas require better control over specific particle shapes and sizes of their products.

<text>The Millerites were the followers of the teachings of William Miller, who in 1831 first shared publicly his belief that the Second Advent of Jesus Christ would occur in roughly the year 1843–1844. Coming during the Second Great Awakening, his teachings were spread widely and grew in popularity, which led to the event known as the Great Disappointment.

==Origins==
Miller was a prosperous farmer, a Baptist lay preacher, and student of the Bible living in northeastern New York. He spent years of intensive study of symbolic meaning of the prophecies of Daniel, especially Daniel 8:14 (Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed), the 2,300-day prophecy. Miller believed that the cleansing of the sanctuary represented the Earth&#x27;s destruction by fire at Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Using the year-day method of prophetic interpretation, Miller became convinced that the 2,300-day period started in 457 BC with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem by Artaxerxes I of Persia. Simple calculation then indicated that this period would end about 1843. In September 1822, Miller formally stated his conclusions in a twenty-point document, including article 15, &quot;I believe that the second coming of Jesus Christ is near, even at the door, even within twenty-one years,—on or before 1843.&quot; This document remained private for many years. Miller did eventually share his views, first to a few friends privately and later to some ministerial acquaintances. Initially he was disappointed at the lack of response from those he spoke to. &quot;To my astonishment, I found very few who listened with any interest. Occasionally, one would see the force of the evidence, but the great majority passed it by as an idle tale.&quot; Miller states that he began his public lecturing in the village of Dresden, Washington County, New York, some 16 miles from his home, on &quot;the first Sabbath in August 1833.&quot; However, as Sylvester Bliss points out, &quot;The printed article from which this is copied was written in 1845. By an examination of his correspondence, it appears that he must have begun to lecture in August 1831. So that this date is a mistake of the printer or an error in Mr. Miller&#x27;s memory.&quot; In 1832, Miller submitted a series of sixteen articles to the &quot;Vermont Telegraph&quot;—a Baptist paper. The first of these was published on May 15, and Miller writes of the public&#x27;s response, &quot;I began to be flooded with letters of inquiry respecting my views, and visitors flocked to converse with me on the subject.&quot; In 1834, unable to personally comply with many of the urgent requests for information and the invitations to travel and preach that he received, Miller published a synopsis of his teachings in a &quot;little tract of 64 pages.&quot; These he &quot;...scattered, the most of them gratuitously, sending them in reply to letters of inquiry and to places which I could not visit.&quot;

==A national movement==

From 1840 onward, Millerism was transformed from an &quot;obscure, regional movement into a national campaign.&quot; The key figure in this transformation was Joshua Vaughan Himes—the pastor of Chardon Street Chapel in Boston, and a publisher. Though Himes did not fully accept Miller&#x27;s ideas until 1842, he established the fortnightly paper &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; to publicize them. The first edition was published on February 28, 1840, with Himes as editor. It continues to be published by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a monthly evangelistic magazine under the same name. Periodical literature played a part in the rapid and widespread dissemination of Millerite beliefs. &quot;From first to last the power of the press, in this particular form, was one of the foremost factors in the success of this now vigorous, expanding movement.&quot; In addition to the &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; based in Boston, Millerite papers were published in numerous cities including New York City, Philadelphia, Rochester, Cleveland, and Montreal, Quebec. There were at least 48 Millerite periodicals that circulated in the period leading up to the Great Disappointment. The majority of these, however, were quite short-lived—often a new paper was started whenever a Millerite evangelistic campaign entered a new area. As well as publications based on geography, the Millerites issued various papers targeting different groups. &quot;The Advent Message to the Daughters of Zion&quot; focused on female readers, and was first published in May 1844. &quot;The Advent Shield&quot; was a more academically orientated paper published in Boston and edited by Joshua Vaughan Himes, Sylvester Bliss, and Apollos Hale. Its announced purpose was to &quot;defend the doctrine from the attacks of the enemies, to exhibit the unscriptural position of the opponents, and furnish the truth to those who were ready to receive it.&quot; While only three issues were produced: in May 1844, January 1845, and a final issue in April 1845; it was the largest of the Millerite papers, the first two issues each having 144 pages, and the final having 250. As the various dates of Christ&#x27;s predicted return approached, Millerite publishing increased. In May 1843, 21,000 copies of the various Millerite papers were published for distribution each week. In New York alone, in the five-month period ending April 1843, 600,000 copies of various publications were distributed. In December 1843, Himes proposed the publication of one million tracts, while in May 1844, he announced that five million copies of Millerite publications had been distributed up to that time. Ruth Alden Doan examined the geographical distribution of correspondents to the Millerite periodical &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; from 1840 to 1847. Out of a total of 615 correspondents, she found that the 131 correspondents from New York State provided the largest group. Vermont provided another 107, with New England (excluding Vermont) accounting for a further 279. Outside of these areas, representation was sparse: 23 in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland combined; just 65 from the west—including 20 from Ohio; and only 10 from the Southern States. While it seems then, that the vast majority of Miller’s followers were of local origin, his message was not limited to his local area—nor even to the United States. Miller preached across the border in Canada’s Eastern Townships on at least three occasions: in 1835, 1838 and 1840. He made a number of converts there and gained the support of some of the local clergy. At least five Millerite papers were published in Canada: the &quot;Faithful Watchman&quot;—published in Sherbrooke from January 1843; the influential &quot;Voice of Elijah&quot;, published in Montreal from June 1843; the short-lived &quot;Hope of the Church&quot; in St. Thomas in 1844; &quot;Behold, He Cometh&quot; in Hamilton, and the &quot;Bridegroom&#x27;s Herald&quot; in Toronto, both from mid-1844. Many travelers or emigrants to the United States who had heard the Second Advent message there returned to their home districts to preach. From 1841, Millerite evangelists appeared in Great Britain, also, though he never travelled there himself. In addition to the nearly $1,000 that Miller and Himes spent supplying literature to enquirers and evangelists in Great Britain, &quot;there is evidence that [in Liverpool, Bristol, and other ports] local Millerite pioneers borrowed copies of Miller&#x27;s works and Adventist magazines from visiting American sea captains and merchants.&quot; As well as using imported American literature, two Millerite papers were published locally in Great Britain: the &quot;Second Advent Harbinger&quot; in Bristol, and the &quot;British Midnight Cry&quot; in Liverpool. The Millerite message entered Australia through the Canadian paper &quot;Voice of Elijah&quot;. Thomas Playford, living in Adelaide, was converted thus. Playford spread the Millerite message in Australia, even publishing a book of his sermons: &quot;Discourses on the Second Advent of Jesus Christ&quot;. Playford’s preaching apparently resulted in a number of converts. An English Millerite by the name of James William Bonham sent copies of &quot;The Midnight Cry&quot; to Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania), though no record remains of their effect. In a similar manner, converts were made in Norway and Chile. A letter published in &quot;The Midnight Cry&quot; of October 12, 1843, from a Mrs. O. S. Burnham of Kaloa, the Sandwich Islands, (now Hawaii) stated that she and her husband had accepted the Millerite message and were worshipping with a small company of believers. Despite the urging of his supporters, Miller never personally set an exact date for the expected Second Advent. However, in response to their urgings he did narrow the time-period to sometime in the year 1843, stating: &quot;My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844&quot; March 21, 1844 passed without incident, and the majority of Millerites maintained their faith. On March 25, Miller wrote to Himes, &quot;I am still looking for the Dear Savior... The time, as I have calculated it, is now filled up; and I expect every moment to see the Savior descend from heaven. I have now nothing to look for but this glorious hope.&quot; According to George R. Knight, the movement&#x27;s survival was a result of the fact that, &quot;the Millerite leaders had been ‘soft’ on the time... They allowed for the possibility of small errors in their calculations and even in some of their historic dates.&quot; In fact, on February 28, Miller himself had written, &quot;If Christ comes, as we expect, we will sing the song of victory soon; if not, we will watch, and pray, and preach until he comes, for soon our time, and all prophetic days, will have been filled.&quot; Further discussion and study resulted in the brief adoption of a new date—April 18, 1844, one based on the Karaite Jewish calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ&#x27;s return. More study led the Millerites to believe that they had entered the &quot;tarrying time&quot;—a time of waiting after which Christ would finally return. This belief sustained the Millerites through the months of May to July 1844. As Knight notes however, this period represented a &quot;flatness in Millerite evangelism,&quot; when even the Millerite preachers must have experienced diminished certainty. In August 1844 at a camp-meeting in Exeter, New Hampshire, everything changed when Samuel S. Snow presented a message of earth-shattering proportions—what became known as the &quot;seventh-month&quot; message or the &quot;true midnight cry.&quot; In a complex discussion based on scriptural typology, Snow presented his conclusion (still based on the 2,300-day prophecy in Daniel 8:14), that Christ would return on, &quot;the tenth day of the seventh month of the present year, 1844.&quot; Again using the calendar of the Karaite Jews, this date was determined to be October 22, 1844. This &quot;seventh month message&quot; &quot;spread with a rapidity unparalleled in the Millerite experience&quot; amongst the general population. The situation caught many of the established leaders—including Himes and Miller himself, by surprise. Knight reports that, &quot;There is no evidence that any of the foremost Millerite preachers accepted this grass-roots development until late September. Most did not accept it until early October.&quot;

==Great Disappointment==

October 22, 1844, the day Jesus was expected to return, ended like any other day to the disappointment of the Millerites. Both Millerite leaders and followers were left generally bewildered and disillusioned. Responses varied: some Millerites continued to look daily for Christ’s return, others predicted different dates—among them April, July, and October 1845. Some theorized that the world had entered the seventh millennium, the &quot;Great Sabbath&quot;, and that, therefore, the saved should not work. Others acted as children, basing their belief on Jesus’ words in Mark 10:15, &quot;Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.&quot; J. D. Pickands used Revelation 14:14–16 to teach that Christ was now sitting on a white cloud, and must be prayed down. Some simply gave up their beliefs and attempted to rebuild their lives. Some members rejoined their previous denominations, while a substantial number became Shakers. Hundreds joined the Shakers, who believed that Christ had already appeared for the second time in the person of Mother Ann Lee. The &quot;Advents&#x27;&quot; impact was greatest on the Shaker villages at Union Village and Whitewater, Ohio, Harvard, Massachusetts, and Canterbury, New Hampshire. Some remained Shakers for the rest of their lives; others left after a short time.

==Post-Great Disappointment Millerism==

In the confusion that followed the Great Disappointment it seemed that almost every Millerite had an opinion—all of them different. Miller said that in one week he received sixteen different papers advocating different views, all claiming to be Advent papers. Much of the responsibility for this proliferation of viewpoints must be shouldered by Miller, whose Rules of Biblical Interpretation outlined a method of biblical study that encouraged each person to read the Bible and to &quot;do theology&quot; for themselves. By mid-1845, doctrinal lines amongst the various Millerite groups began to solidify, emphasizing their differences—a process Knight terms &quot;sect building.&quot; During this time three main Millerite groups formed, in addition to those who had simply given up their beliefs. The first major division of the Millerite groups who had not completely given up their belief in Christ’s Second Advent were those who accepted a shut-door theology. This belief was popularized by Joseph Turner and was based on that key Millerite passage: Matthew 25:1–13—the Parable of the Ten Virgins. The shut door mentioned in verses 11–12 was interpreted as the &quot;close of probation&quot;. As Knight explains, &quot;After the door was shut, there would be no additional salvation. The wise virgins (true believers) would be in the kingdom, while the foolish virgins and all others would be on the outside.&quot; The belief became a major issue upon the publication in January 1845, of an article by Apollos Hale and Turner in &quot;The Advent Mirror&quot;. This article tied the shut-door concept to October 22, 1844, teaching that the work of general salvation was finished at that date—Christ came spiritually as the Bridegroom, the wise virgins had entered into the wedding feast, and the door was then shut on all others. This first group is commonly known as either the &quot;shut-door&quot; or &quot;spiritualizer&quot; group. The widespread acceptance of the &quot;shut-door&quot; belief lost ground as doubts were raised about the significance of the October 22, 1844, date—if nothing happened on that date, then there could be no shut door. The opposition to these &quot;shut-door&quot; beliefs was led by Joshua Vaughan Himes and make up the second post-&#x27;Great Disappointment&#x27; group. This faction soon gained the upper hand, even converting Miller to their point of view. On March 20, 1845, the &quot;Morning Watch&quot; published a call by Himes for a conference. The Albany Conference was to have three purposes:
# &quot;to strengthen one another in the faith of the Advent at the door,&quot;
# &quot;to consult on the best mode of unitedly carrying forth our work, in comforting and preparing the Advent congregations among us for the speedy coming of the Lord,&quot; and
# &quot;to unite our efforts, for the conversion and salvation of sinners.&quot;
Notably, the stated purpose of the conference was not to debate controversial doctrines. In fact the invitation was extended only to those Adventists who &quot;still adhere to the original faith.&quot; The Shut-door Adventists and others who had developed new doctrines were therefore explicitly excluded. The biggest draw was to be the presence of Miller. In fact Himes wrote to Miller on March 27, 1845, saying, &quot;all depends upon your being there.&quot; The Albany Conference began on April 29, 1845, and was to be, &quot;one of the most significant Adventist meetings in the history of post-October 1844 Adventism.&quot; The delegates to the Albany Conference – including prominent Millerite leaders such as Miller, Himes. Elon Galusha, Josiah Litch, and Sylvester Bliss; accomplished three main tasks:
# The production of a ten-point statement of belief.
# The development of a plan for evangelism that involved further organization, including the establishment of Sunday Schools and Bible classes; and the ordination of selected believers as ministers.
# The passing of a series of resolutions that rejected a number of beliefs and practices seen as extreme; including mixed foot-washing, compulsory salutation kissing, shaving one&#x27;s head, and acting childlike.

The Albany Conference group of Millerites formed the Evangelical Adventists out of which rose the Advent Christian Church. The Albany Conference Statement with its narrowing of beliefs was unacceptable to many. Millerism had been founded on Miller&#x27;s open, non-restrictive approach to Bible study—&quot;It was the freedom to discover new truths that had drawn so many Christians and Freewill Baptists to the movement. The new restrictive definitions charted a course that was unacceptable to many who had joined the movement.&quot; The third major post-disappointment Millerite group also claimed—like the Hale and Turner led group—that the October 22 date was correct. Rather than Christ returning invisibly however, they came to view the event that took place on October 22, 1844, as having been quite different. The theology of this third group appears to have had its beginnings as early as October 23, 1844—the day after the Great Disappointment. On that day, during a prayer session with a group of Advent believers, Hiram Edson became convinced that &quot;light would be given&quot; and their &quot;disappointment explained.&quot; Some years later, Edson reported on his experiences following that meeting: &quot;While passing through a large field I was stopped about midway of the field. Heaven seemed open to my view, and I saw distinctly and clearly that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the heavenly sanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days, that He for the first time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary; and that He had a work to perform in the Most Holy before coming to this earth in His Second Coming. That he came to the marriage at that time; in other words, to the Ancient of Days to receive a kingdom, dominion, and glory; and we must wait for his return from the wedding.&quot; Edson&#x27;s experience led him into an extended study on the topic with O. R. L. Crosier and F. B. Hahn. They came to the conclusion that &quot;the sanctuary to be cleansed in Daniel 8:14 was not the earth or the church, but the sanctuary in heaven.&quot; Therefore, the October 22 date marked not the Second Coming of Christ, but rather a heavenly event. This is the basis for the later Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the Investigative Judgement. An article written by O. R. L. Crosier titled &quot;To All Who Are Waiting for Redemption, the Following is Addressed&quot; summarising their insights, was published in the March 1845 edition of the &quot;Day-Dawn&quot;. A more comprehensive article—also by O. R. L. Crosier and titled &quot;The Law of Moses&quot; was published in the &quot;Day-Star&quot; of February 7, 1846. It is out of this third Millerite group that the Seventh-day Adventist Church arose.

==Doctrine==
The Millerites originally had adherents across denominational lines, especially from Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist and Campbellite churches, forming distinct denominations only after the Great Disappointment. They were united by a belief in the imminent return of Jesus Christ—the Second Advent. After the Great Disappointment of October 22, 1844, discussion of beliefs began to fragment the once united Millerites. Dunton points out that there were four main divisive doctrines being discussed by Millerites around the time of the Albany Conference:
#Biblical prophecies relating to the Jews. The majority of Millerites believed that these prophecies would find a spiritual rather than a literal fulfilment; however the Age to Come Adventists led by Joseph Marsh believed in a literal, physical Jewish return to Palestine prior to the Christ&#x27;s return.
#Conditional immortality was not discussed at the Albany Conference, but was a source of controversy soon after.
#The doctrine of the Sabbath was one of the schismatic issues debated at the Albany Conferences. The seventh-day Sabbath was rejected by delegates at the Albany Conference, who passed a resolution to have &quot;no fellowship with Jewish fables and commandments of man, that turn from the truth.&quot; Sabbatarianism remained a minority position among the Millerites, but the doctrine received a significant boost when Thomas Preble published a tract on the topic. The tract, titled, &quot;A Tract, Showing that the Seventh Day Should Be Observed as the Sabbath, Instead of the First Day; &quot;According to the Commandment&quot;&quot;, was widely read by Miller&#x27;s followers.
#Following the disappointment of October 22, there was considerable discussion regarding the continuing possibility of the conversion of sinners. The doctrine that excluded this possibility became known as the shut-door. Miller himself believed this for a short time, though he later changed and repudiated it.

== Influence ==
The Bible Student movement had connections at the very beginning (in the early 2nd half of 19th century) with the Millerite movement. Charles Taze Russell later stated that &quot;I confess indebtedness to Adventists as well as to other denominations&quot;. In light of this, the Bible Student Movement was influenced by Adventists roots, but did not emerge from the Millerism movement. Followers of the Baháʼí Faith also credit Miller&#x27;s analysis of the time of Christ&#x27;s return. See also Day-year principle for a more complete review of how William Miller&#x27;s analysis of the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8 matches the Baháʼí understanding. Baháʼís believe that, although William Miller&#x27;s understanding of the location and method of Christ&#x27;s return was not accurate, his calculation of the timing was entirely correct. Many Adventist sects emerged from the movement, including Seventh Day Adventists.

<doc id="145025" wikidata="Q752020" url="?curid=145025" title="Honey possum">
<text>The honey possum or noolbenger (Tarsipes rostratus), is a tiny species of marsupial that feeds on the nectar and pollen of a diverse range of flowering plants. Found only in southwest Australia, it is an important pollinator for such plants as &quot;Banksia attenuata&quot;, &quot;Banksia coccinea&quot; and &quot;Adenanthos cuneatus&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The first description of the diprotodont species was published by Paul Gervais and Jules Verreaux on 3 March 1842, referring to a specimen collected by Verreaux. The lectotype nominated for this species, held in the collection at National Museum of Natural History, France, was collected the Swan River Colony. A description of a second species &quot;Tarsipes spenserae&quot;, published five days later by John Edward Gray and current until the 1970s, was thought to have been published earlier by T. S. Palmer in 1904 and displaced the usage of &quot;T. rostratus&quot;. A review by Mahoney in 1984 again reduced &quot;T. spenserae&quot; to a synonym for the species, as was the emendation to its spelling as &quot;spencerae&quot; cited by William Ride (1970) and others.
Gray&#x27;s specimen was provided by George Grey to the British Museum of Natural History, the skin of a male also collected at King George Sound.
The author was aware of the description prepared by Gervais, who after examining his specimen suggested it represented a second species.

The population is the only known species in the genus Tarsipes, and assigned to a monotypic diprotodont family Tarsipedidae. The name of the genus means &quot;tarsier-foot&quot;, given for a resemblance to tarsier&#x27;s simian-like feet and toes noted by the earliest descriptions.

The poorly resolved phylogeny of ancestral marsupial relationships has presented this taxon, unique in many characteristics, in an arrangement of other higher classifications, including the separation as a superfamily Tarsipedoidea, later abandoned in favour grouping of South American and Australian marsupials as a monophyletic clade that ignores the modern geographic remoteness of these continent&#x27;s fauna.

The relationships of the monotypic family within the Diprotodontia order as a petauroid alliance may be summarised as,
*Superfamily Petauroidea
** Family Pseudocheiridae ringtail possums
** Family Petauridae gliders and trioks
** Family Tarsipedidae
*** Genus &quot;Tarsipes&quot;
**** &quot;Tarsipes rostratus&quot;
** Family Acrobatidae gliders

The closest relationship to other taxa was theorised to be &quot;Dromiciops gliroides&quot;, another smaller marsupial that occurs in South America and is known as the extant member of a genus that is represented in the Gondwanan fossil record. This was supported by phylogenetic analysis, but this is no longer believed to be true.

At Grey&#x27;s suggestion, the maiden name of his wife Eliza Lucy Spencer was assigned to the epithet. Eliza or Elizabeth was the daughter of the government resident at King George Sound, Richard Spencer, prompting the unacceptable correction by Ride in 1970.

The common names include those cited or coined by Gilbert, Gould and Ellis Troughton, honey and long-snouted phalanger, tait and noolbenger in the local languages, or the descriptive brown barred mouse. An ethnographic survey of Noongar words recorded for the species found three names were in use, and proposed that these be regularised for spelling and pronunciation as &quot;ngoolboongoor&quot; (ngool&#x27;bong&#x27;oor), &quot;djebin&quot; (dje&#x27;bin) and &quot;dat&quot;. The term honey mouse was recorded by Troughton in 1922 as commonly used in the districts around King George Sound.

==Description==

A tiny marsupial that climbs woody plants to feed on the pollen and nectar, the honey, of banksia and eucalypts. They resemble a small mouse or the arboreal possums of Australia, and are readily distinguished by the exceptionally long muzzle and three brown stripes from the head to the rump.
The pelage is a cream colour below that merges to rufous at the flanks, the overall coloration of the upperparts is a mix of brown and grey hairs. A dark brown central stripe extends from the rump to a mid-point between the ears, this is a more distinct stripe than the two paler adjacent stripes. The length of the tail is from , exceeding the combined body and head length of , and has a prehensile ability that assists in climbing. The recorded weight range for the species is .

The number of teeth are fewer and most much smaller than is typical for marsupials, with the molars reduced to tiny cones. The dental formula of I2/1 C1/0 P1/0 M3/3 totals no more than 22 teeth.
The morphology of the elongated snout&#x27;s jaws and dentition presents a number of unique characteristics suited to the specialisation as a palynivore and nectivore.
&quot;Tarsipes&quot; tongue is extensible and the end covered in brush-like papillae, with the redundant action of the modified or reduced teeth being replaced by the interaction of the tongue, keel-like lower incisors and a fine combing surface at the palate.

The testes are very large in size, noted as proportionally the greatest for a mammal at 4.6 percent of the body weight. The sperm also has an exceptional length; its tail (flagellum) measurement of 360 micrometres also cited as the longest known.
Specialised characters of &quot;T. rostratus&quot; include visual acuity for detecting the bright yellow inflorescence of &quot;Banksia attenuata&quot;.

They have a typical lifespan between one and two years.

They have trichromat vision, similar to some other marsupials as well as primates but unlike most mammals which have dichromat vision.

==Behaviour==
The honey possum is mainly nocturnal, but will come out to feed during daylight in cooler weather. Generally, though, it spends the days asleep in a shelter of convenience: a rock cranny, a tree cavity, the hollow inside of a grass tree, or an abandoned bird nest. When food is scarce, or in cold weather, it becomes torpid to conserve energy. In comparison to other marsupials of a similar size, &quot;T. rostratus&quot; has a high body temperature and metabolic rate that is termed euthermic. Lacking fat reserves, but able to reduce their body temperature, exposure to cooler temperatures or lack of food induces one of two states of torpor. One response is a shallow and brief period, similar to torpid dasyurids, where the body temperature is above 10–15 degrees Celsius, and another deeper state like the burramyids that lasts for multiple days and reduces their temperature to less than .

The species is able to climb with the assistance of the prehensile tail and an opposable first toe at the long hindfoot that is able to grip like a monkey&#x27;s paw. The bristle-like papillae at the upper surface of the tongue increase in length toward the tip, and this is used to gather the pollen and nectar by rapidly wiping it into the inflorescence.
Both its front and back feet are adept at grasping, enabling it to climb trees with ease, as well as traverse the undergrowth at speed. The honey possum can also use its prehensile tail (which is longer than its head and body combined) to grip, much like another arm.
Radio-tracking has shown that males particularly are quite mobile, moving distances of up to 0.5 km in a night and use areas averaging 0.8 hectares. Males seem to venture out in a larger range, and some evidence indicates greater distances covered; evidence of pollen found on an individual in a study area was from a banksia not found within three kilometres of the collection site. 
The plant species that provide nectar and pollen to &quot;T. rostratus&quot; are primarily genera of Proteaceae, &quot;Banksia&quot; and &quot;Adenanthos&quot;, and Myrtaceae, eucalypts and &quot;Agonis&quot;, and those of Epacridaceae, shrubby heath plants, although it is also known to visit the inflorescence of &quot;Anigozanthos&quot;, the kangaroo paws, and the tall spikes of &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;, the grass-trees.
Study of the amount of nectar and pollen has concluded that a nine gram individual requires around seven millilitres of nectar and one gram of pollen each day to maintain an energetic balance. This amount of pollen provides sufficient nitrogen for the species high activity metabolism, and the additional nitrogen requirements of females during lactation is available in the pollen of &quot;Banksia&quot; species.
The ingestion of excess water when feeding at wet flowers, a frequent circumstance in the high rainfall regions of its range, is able to be eliminated by kidneys that can process up to two times the animal&#x27;s body weight in water.
Pollen grains are digested over the course of six hours, extracting almost all the nutrients they contain.

== Reproduction ==
Breeding depends on the availability of nectar and can occur at any time of the year. Females are promiscuous, mating with a large number of males and may simultaneously carry embryos from different progenitors. Competition has led to the males having very large testicles relative to their body weight, at a relative mass of 4.2% it is amongst the largest known for a mammal. Their sperm is the largest in the mammal world, measuring 365 micrometres.

The development of blastocysts corresponds to day length, induced by a shorter photoperiod, but other reproductive processes are prompted by other factor, probably food availability. Gestation lasts for 28 days, with two to four young being produced. At birth, they are the smallest of any mammal, weighing 0.005 g. Nurturing and development within the pouch lasts for about 60 days, after which they emerge covered in fur and with open eyes, weighing some . As soon as they emerge, they are often left in a sheltered area (such as a hollow in a tree) while the mother searches for food for herself, but within days, they learn to grab hold of the mother&#x27;s back and travel with her. However, their weight soon becomes too much, and they stop nursing at around 11 weeks, and start to make their own homes shortly thereafter. As is common in marsupials, a second litter is often born when the pouch is vacated by the first, fertilised embryos being stopped from developing.

Most of the time, honey possums stick to separate territories of about one hectare (2.5 acres), outside of the breeding season. They live in small groups of no more than 10, which results in them engaging in combat with one another only rarely. During the breeding season, females move into smaller areas with their young, which they will defend fiercely, especially from any males.

==Distribution==
Although restricted to a fairly small range in the southwest of Western Australia, it is locally common and does not seem to be threatened with extinction so long as its habitat of heath, shrubland, and woodland remains intact and diverse.
Records of locations held at the Western Australian Museum indicate they are more common in regions of high Proteaceae diversity, areas such as banksia woodlands where species can be found flowering at all times of the year.

==Ecology ==
&quot;Tarsipe rostratus&quot; is a keystone species in the ecology of the coastal sands of Southwest Australia, complex assemblages of plants known as kwongan, and are likely to be the primary pollinator of woody shrubs such as banksia and &quot;Adenanthos&quot;. Their feeding activity involves visits to many individual plants and the head carries a small pollen load that can convey more effectively than the birds that visit the same flowers. The favoured species &quot;Banksia attenuata&quot; appears to be obliged to this animal as a pollination vector, and both species have evolved to suit their mutualistic interactions.

The effect of fire frequency on the population was evaluated in a study over a twenty three-year period, giving indications of resilience of the species to the first fire in the area and a subsequent burn six years later. The effect of increased frequency and intensity of fire, due to global warming and prescribed burns can adversely affect the suitability of the local habitat.
The species is susceptible to the impact of &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, a soil borne fungal-like species that is associated with forest dieback in the eucalypt forests and banksia woodlands of the region. The flowers of the nine plant species most favoured by &quot;T. rostratus&quot; provide food throughout the year, and five of these are vulnerable to the withering condition caused by &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot; pathogen.

It is the only entirely nectarivorous mammal which is not a bat; it has a long, pointed snout and a long, protrusile tongue with a brush tip that gathers pollen and nectar, like a honeyeater or a hummingbird. Floral diversity is particularly important for the honey possum, as it cannot survive without a year-round supply of nectar and, unlike nectarivorous birds, it cannot easily travel long distances in search of fresh supplies.

== Natural history ==
An animal well known to the Noongar people of southwest, and incorporated into their culture, the name &quot;ngoolboongoor&quot; from the indigenous language has been proposed for modern usage as a common name, written as noolbenger. Honey possums continue to be an iconic animal to the people of the region, and was selected by Amok Island to feature in a large public art project on silos in the wheatbelt. The first report of the species was compiled by John Gilbert, the careful and thorough field collector commissioned by Gould to travel to the new colony at the Swan River on the west coast of Australia. Gilbert obtained access to Noongar informants that provided him with the names and details of the animal&#x27;s habits and, with some difficulty, four specimens for scientific examination. Both he and Gould recognised the unique characters of the unknown species.

The next major field study was undertaken by the mammalogist Ellis Troughton at the suggestion of H. L. White, who provided an introduction to the professional collector F. Lawson Whitlock. Troughton&#x27;s visit to King George Sound was guided by Whitlock to the source of a specimen he had sent to White, a man in the same region named David Morgan who accommodated the biologist while he searched extensively and unsuccessfully for further specimens. Troughton was eventually provided with a series of a dozen specimens when he was preparing to leave Albany port, a collection assembled over many years by the cats of Hugh Leishman at Nannarup.
The collection of the Australian Museum was increased when Morgan continued to forward specimens to Troughton, firstly with two pregnant females that were also killed by a cat, and then with a report of living animals he was able to maintain in captivity for five to six weeks. Morgan reported that his cat would bring a mangled specimen on a daily basis for a period of time, and observed it seeking them in a flowering shrub at dusk, but thought their local appearance was seasonally related and became absent outside the breeding season.

Closer study of the reproductive processes was allowed by the capture, extended observation and dissection of the species in University programs, the first success in captivity beginning in 1974. Examination of the reproductive strategies has allowed comparison to the other modern marsupial families, in particular the evolution of embryonic diapause.
The population structure and feeding habits of &quot;T. rostratus&quot; was poorly understood until a biological study at the Fitzgerald River National Park was completed in 1984.

A diet consisting entirely of nectar is unusual for a terrestrial vertebrate species, usually birds and flying mammals, and specialisation to the niche provided by the success of plant families Proteaceae and Myrtaceae began around forty million years ago.

<text>[[Flavia gens#Later use|Flavius]] Ardabur Aspar (Greek: Ἄσπαρ, fl. 400471) was an Eastern Roman patrician and &quot;magister militum&quot; (&quot;master of soldiers&quot;) of Alanic-Gothic descent. As the general of a Germanic army in Roman service, Aspar exerted great influence on the Eastern Roman Emperors for half a century, from the 420s to his death in 471, through the reigns of Theodosius II, Marcian and Leo I, who, in the end, had him killed. His death led to the ending of the Germanic domination of Eastern Roman policy.

==Biography==
Aspar was born the son of the magister Ardaburius, and was of Alanic-Gothic descent. The name Aspar (Avestan: &quot;Aspari&quot;) in Iranian languages means &quot;Horse-rider&quot;. Aspar played a crucial role in his father&#x27;s expedition in 424 to defeat the Western usurper Joannes of Ravenna and to install Galla Placidia and her son, Valentinian III, in his place. He also helped to negotiate a peace treaty with Geiseric after the Vandal invasion of Africa.

Aspar attained the consulship in 434 after campaigning in Africa. However, Aspar could not become emperor because of his Arian religion. Instead, he played the role of kingmaker with his subordinate Marcian, who became emperor by marrying Theodosius II&#x27;s sister Pulcheria.

On 27 January 457 Marcian died, and the political and military establishment figures of the Eastern court took eleven days to choose a successor. Despite the presence of a strong candidate to the purple, the &quot;magister militum&quot; and Marcian&#x27;s son-in-law Anthemius, the choice was quite different. Aspar, who in this occasion was probably offered the throne by the senate but refused, could have chosen his own son Ardabur, but instead selected an obscure tribune of one of his military units, Leo I. The account of Leo&#x27;s coronation ceremony records a &quot;foremost patrician&quot; sitting in the chariot with Leo during the procession and a &quot;leading senator&quot; offering him a golden crown at the Forum of Constantine. Aspar is suspected to be both of these.

In 470, in an episode of the struggle for power between Aspar and the Isaurian general Zeno, Aspar persuaded the emperor to appoint his second son, Patricius, as &quot;caesar&quot; and give him in marriage his daughter Leontia. However, since the clergy and people of Constantinople did not consider an Arian eligible to become emperor, at the news of the appointment riots broke out in the city hippodrome, led by the head of the Sleepless Monks, Marcellus: Aspar and Leo had to promise to the bishops that Patricius would convert to Orthodoxy before becoming emperor, and only after the conversion would he marry Leontia.

In 471 an imperial conspiracy organized by Leo I and the Isaurians caused the death of Aspar and of his elder son Ardabur. It is possible that Patricius died on this occasion, although some sources report that he recovered from his wounds. His death led to the ending of the Germanic domination of Eastern Roman policy.

Aspar had another son, Ermanaric, with the sister of Theodoric Strabo and daughter of Triarius. Aspar&#x27;s wife was an Ostrogoth, as the Ostrogoth King Theodoric the Great was her nephew. A cistern attributed to Aspar still exists today in Istanbul.
