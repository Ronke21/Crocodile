Nibegomowin more closely translates to night-time game waiting and could be a place where games, such as bears, are rested or tracked at night. Sleeping Bear River (Nebagamon Creek) can be seen on Nicollet’s 1843 map, Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi River.

<doc id="139014" wikidata="Q444199" url="?curid=139014" title="Altoona, Wisconsin">
<text>Altoona ( ) is a city in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,292 at the 2020 census with an estimated population in 2022 of 9,149. The city is a railroad terminal on the Union Pacific Railroad.

==History==
The settlement of Altoona began in 1881 when the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway selected the site for a new terminal to replace the overcrowded existing terminal in Eau Claire. The railroad had originally planned to put the new terminal in Fall Creek, but the city of Eau Claire lobbied for a site closer to the existing one, and representatives from Eau Claire and the railroad walked the tracks from Fall Creek to Eau Claire to determine a suitable site. When the location of present-day Altoona - approximately three miles east of the existing Eau Claire terminal - was found to have sufficient flat land and access to water (via the Eau Claire River), the railroad began construction of the new terminal and the community of &quot;East Eau Claire&quot; was platted in October.

Residents began moving into the community in early 1882 and the railroad terminal became operational in May of that year. However, confusion between the &quot;Eau Claire&quot; and &quot;East Eau Claire&quot; stations quickly caused the railroad to rename the new terminal &quot;Altoona&quot; on October 14, 1882. The name &quot;Altoona&quot; was based on Altoona, Pennsylvania, which in turn was named after Allatoona, Georgia. The name choice may also have been influenced by the presence of immigrants from Altona, Germany. Altoona was incorporated as a city on April 5, 1887.

Continued growth in both Altoona and Eau Claire over the past century has left the two cities adjacent to one another, with Fairfax St. and Bus. 53 providing a general boundary between the two, although the actual border is irregular. County Highway AA generally forms the eastern limits of the city. Altoona is bounded on the north by Lake Altoona and the Eau Claire River. To the south, the city limits generally follow Otter Creek.

==Geography==
Altoona is located at (44.804110, -91.442183).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Altoona is situated near Lake Altoona, a man-made lake, with water provided by the Eau Claire River.

<doc id="139019" wikidata="Q2293459" url="?curid=139019" title="Skyservice Airlines">
<text>Skyservice Airlines Inc. was a charter airline (Skyservice Airlines) based in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It employed more than 2,000 people. Skyservice Airlines Inc. flew within Canada and to the United States, Caribbean, Mexico, Venezuela, Israel and Europe. During the summer, Skyservice sold tickets to Europe from Toronto using a Boeing 757-200WL. It also used an Airbus A330-300 for other chartered flights to Europe from Canada. Scheduled services to some destinations were offered during the summer season. Skyservice offered online-booking for those who wished to travel on Skyservice&#x27;s scheduled destinations in the summer. Skyservice Airlines began operations in 1994.

Skyservice was forced into receivership on March 31, 2010, as a result of a near $9 million debt to its long-term partner Sunquest Vacations. As a result, Skyservice abruptly ceased operations. Roughly 860 jobs were expected to be lost.

==History==

The airline was started in 1986. On May 2, 2005, Skyservice introduced the first of two Boeing 767-300 aircraft to its fleet, the first of which entered service on that date with a flight from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. The aircraft (both formerly with MyTravel Airways) operated summer charters from Toronto to the United Kingdom and Europe for Sunquest Vacations, and in the winter flew from Vancouver to the Caribbean and Mexico. It was one of the few discount airlines operating in Canada which still offered full meal service.

On August 28, 2007, it was announced that Skyservice had sold a majority interest in its airlines business to Vancouver-based private equity company Gibralt Capital Corp. No changes in senior management, operations or staffing levels were planned.

In March 2009, Skyservice partnered with Inflite Media to offer tray table advertising across its fleet of aircraft, the first such advertising network available in Canada.

Skyservice was forced into receivership on March 31, 2010, as a result of an $8.8 million debt to its long-term partner Sunquest Vacations. The last Skyservice flight, from Punta Cana to Winnipeg, took place on the same day.

The private charter portion of the airline continues to operate today under Skyservice Business Aviation with fixed base operations in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Calgary.

In December 2024, Skyservice Business Aviation announced its designation as an Authorized Starlink Dealer. This partnership aims to enhance the availability of Starlink&#x27;s high-speed and reliable in-flight connectivity solutions for business aircraft owners and operators, broadening access to advanced connectivity technologies in the aviation sector.

==Fleet==
The Skyservice fleet consisted of the following aircraft on 20 November 2009:

===Historical fleet===
*2 Boeing 767-300
*4 Airbus A319
*1 Airbus A330-300

==Classes==
*Economy Class
*Star Class
*Superior Class 
*Premier Class

==Awards and recognition==
Skyservice was recognized for its exceptional safety record during its 25 years of operation, distinguishable by
the highest Platinum rating awarded to Skyservice by the Aviation Research Group/US - North
America&#x27;s most rigid rating for operational safety.

==Skyservice Business Aviation==
While the airline ceased operations, the business aviation section remains in operation today in Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Montreal.

Sang, an organizer of the Seven Mile Creek Community, and then its postmaster and town clerk, circulated a petition to change the name of the town from Seven Mile Creek to Lamartine, in honor of the French revolutionary, whose works and political activity had been acknowledged by the United States Government on April 26, 1848, by formal diplomatic recognition. On June 13, 1848, a bill was offered to the First Wisconsin Legislature, to change the name of the community from Seven Mile Creek to Lamartine. The bill was passed and signed into law by Governor Nelson Dewey on August 8, 1848.

The Town of Marshfield is the site of the large industrial wind factory installation (wind farm) called the Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm, along with neighboring Town of Calumet. It was constructed throughout the town in 2007 and it opened in May 2008. This site is being contracted by the energy company supplying electricity in the area, WEC. This siting was the reason for a suit that was filed by some citizens of the locale (a.k.a. Concerned Citizens of Marshfield). This action was dismissed in local circuit court by Judge Peter Grimm. His finding in the case was that there was no nuisance caused by the installation, since the installation had not yet been built. This was partly based upon landmark case law in Wisconsin, the State of WI v Quality Egg.

Bishop John Henni confirmed the first child from Mount Calvary at the St. John the Baptist Church in nearby Johnsburg (it was the only church in the region).

The community&#x27;s first general store was built in 1851–1852. Two priests arrived on October 15, 1856, to establish a monastery (it later became the St. Lawrence Seminary High School). A post office was built in November 1877; Anthony Rothgery was named first postmaster. A railroad was established in the 1850s and 1860s; it connected Sheboygan to Fond du Lac.

==History==

Argonne was originally named Van Zile after Abraham Van Zile, who platted the area in 1888. A post office was established a year later. The town&#x27;s name was changed to North Crandon in 1892 and later to Argonne—after the French Forest of Argonne—in 1929 to honor veterans of World War I.

The town is located on the rail line from Minneapolis towards Sault Ste. Marie which was the origin of the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad. Whereas that line runs roughly east-to-west, another line diverges southwards at &quot;Wisconsin Junction&quot; just west of Argonne. This line to Neenah was one the last to be used by a mixed train, i. e. a train carrying both freight and passengers. From the late 1960s into the 1980s, the trains no longer carried dedicated passenger cars but riders could use the Caboose.

==History==
Lancaster originated as a planned community to serve as the county seat for Grant County. Anticipating the county&#x27;s establishment in 1836, Major Glendower M. Price, a Cassville merchant and land speculator, purchased the site of Lancaster for its central location in the county. Major Price platted the town on a compass-aligned grid in 1837, reserving a large central square for the new county government. He was persuaded to name the city Lancaster by a relative who migrated from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Maj. Price and Daniel Banfill contracted to construct the first county courthouse, which stood on the square from 1838–1851. A second courthouse was constructed in 1852–1853 and enlarged in 1865. The present, third courthouse was constructed on the site in 1902.

Pleasant Ridge, one of the first African-American communities in Wisconsin, was founded just outside Lancaster by the Shepard family in 1849 and settled in the 1850s. Lancaster was the home of the first governor of Wisconsin, Nelson Dewey.

<doc id="139098" wikidata="Q37001" url="?curid=139098" title="Toshiro Mifune">
<text>was a Japanese actor and producer. The recipient of numerous awards and accolades over a lengthy career, he is widely considered one of the greatest actors of all time. A leading figure in the Japanese film industry, he often played hypermasculine characters and was noted for his commanding screen presence.

Although he amassed more than 180 screen credits, Mifune is best known for his 16 collaborations with director Akira Kurosawa. These collaborations included Kurosawa&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films such as &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), for which Mifune won the San Marco Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; (1957), &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958), and &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961), for which Mifune won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival and was recognised at the Blue Ribbon Awards as Best Actor. He also portrayed Miyamoto Musashi in Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s &quot;Samurai Trilogy&quot; (1954–1956), Lord Toranaga in the NBC television miniseries &quot;Shōgun&quot;, and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto in three different films.

In 1962, he established &quot;Mifune Productions&quot;, achieving success with large-scale works including &quot;The Sands of Kurobe&quot; (1968) and &quot;Samurai Banners&quot; (1969). He starred in his directorial debut film &quot;Goju Man-nin no Isan&quot; (1963). Following his performance in the 1965 film &quot;Red Beard&quot;, which won him the Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for a second time, Mifune turned to roles abroad. He starred in films such as &quot;Ánimas Trujano&quot; (1962), for which he won another Blue Ribbon Award for Best Actor, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), which was his Hollywood debut, &quot;Hell in the Pacific&quot; (1968), &quot;Red Sun&quot; (1971), &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; (1975), &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;1941&quot; (1979).

Mifune died of organ failure on December 24, 1997. In 1999, he was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame. He is the subject of the featured-length documentary, &quot;&quot; (2015), about his life and his films. In 2016, his name was inscribed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Toshiro Mifune was born on April 1, 1920, in Seitō, Japanese-occupied Shandong (present-day Qingdao, China), the eldest son of Tokuzo and Sen Mifune. His father Tokuzo was a trade merchant and photographer who ran a photography business in Qingdao and Yingkou, and was originally the son of a physician from Kawauchi, Akita Prefecture. His mother Sen was the daughter of a &quot;hatamoto&quot;, a high-ranking samurai official. Toshiro&#x27;s parents, who were working as Methodist missionaries, were some of the Japanese citizens encouraged to live in Shandong by the Japanese government during its occupation before the Republic of China took over the city in 1922. Mifune grew up with his parents and two younger siblings in Dalian, Fengtian from the age of 4 to 19.

In his youth, Mifune worked at his father&#x27;s photo studio. After spending the first 19 years of his life in China, as a Japanese citizen, he was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army Aviation division, where he served in the Aerial Photography unit during World War II.

==Career==
===Early work===
In 1947, a large number of Toho actors, after a prolonged strike, had left to form their own company, Shin Toho. Toho then organized a &quot;new faces&quot; contest to find new talent.

Nenji Oyama, a friend of Mifune&#x27;s who worked for the Photography Department of Toho Productions, sent Mifune&#x27;s resume to the New Faces audition as the Photography Department was full, telling Mifune he could later transfer to the Photography Department if he wished. He was accepted, along with 48 others (out of roughly 4,000 applicants), and allowed to take a screen test for Kajirō Yamamoto. Instructed to mime anger, he drew from his wartime experiences. Yamamoto took a liking to Mifune, recommending him to director Senkichi Taniguchi. This led to Mifune&#x27;s first feature role, in &quot;Shin Baka Jidai&quot;.

Mifune first encountered director Akira Kurosawa when Toho Studios, the largest film production company in Japan, was conducting a massive talent search, during which hundreds of aspiring actors auditioned before a team of judges. Kurosawa was originally going to skip the event, but showed up when Hideko Takamine told him of one actor who seemed especially promising. Kurosawa later wrote that he entered the audition to see &quot;a young man reeling around the room in a violent frenzy ... it was as frightening as watching a wounded beast trying to break loose. I was transfixed.&quot; When Mifune, exhausted, finished his scene, he sat down and gave the judges an ominous stare. He lost the competition but Kurosawa was impressed. &quot;I am a person rarely impressed by actors,&quot; he later said. &quot;But in the case of Mifune I was completely overwhelmed.&quot; Mifune immersed himself into the six-month training and diligently applied himself to studying acting, although at first he still hoped to be transferred to the camera department.

===1950s–1990s===
His imposing bearing, acting range, facility with foreign languages and lengthy partnership with acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa made him the most famous Japanese actor of his time, and easily the best known to Western audiences. He often portrayed samurai or rōnin who were usually coarse and gruff (Kurosawa once explained that the only weakness he could find with Mifune and his acting ability was his &quot;rough&quot; voice), inverting the popular stereotype of the genteel, clean-cut samurai. In such films as &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, he played characters who were often comically lacking in manners, but replete with practical wisdom and experience, understated nobility, and, in the case of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, unmatched fighting prowess. &quot;Sanjuro&quot; in particular contrasts this earthy warrior spirit with the useless, sheltered propriety of the court samurai. Kurosawa valued Mifune highly for his effortless portrayal of unvarnished emotion, once commenting that he could convey in only three feet of film an emotion for which the average Japanese actor would require ten feet. He starred in all three films of Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s Samurai Trilogy (1954–1956), for which the first film in &quot;Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto&quot; was awarded an Honorary Academy Award. Mifune and Inagaki worked together on twenty films, which outnumbered his collaborations with Kurosawa, with all but two falling into the jidaigeki genre, most notably with &quot;Rickshaw Man&quot; (1958), which won the Venice Film Festival Golden Lion.

He was also known for the effort he put into his performances. To prepare for &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Rashomon&quot;, Mifune reportedly studied footage of lions in the wild. For the Mexican film&quot; Ánimas Trujano&quot;, he studied tapes of Mexican actors speaking so that he could recite all of his lines in Spanish. Many Mexicans believed that Toshiro Mifune could have passed for a native of Oaxaca due to his critically acclaimed performance. When asked why he chose Mexico to do his next film, Mifune quoted, &quot;Simply because, first of all, Mr. Ismael Rodríguez convinced me; secondly, because I was eager to work in beautiful Mexico, of great tradition; and thirdly, because the story and character of &#x27;Animas Trujano&#x27; seemed very human to me&quot;. The film was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Oscar. Mifune gave a Japanese pistol as a gift to then-Mexican president Adolfo López Mateos when they met in Oaxaca.

Mifune has been credited as originating the &quot;roving warrior&quot; archetype, which he perfected during his collaboration with Kurosawa. His martial arts instructor was Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū. Sugino created the fight choreography for films such as &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, and Kurosawa instructed his actors to emulate his movements and bearing.

Clint Eastwood was among the first of many actors to adopt this wandering ronin with no name persona for foreign films, which he used to great effect in his Western roles, especially in Spaghetti Westerns directed by Sergio Leone where he played the Man with No Name, a character similar to Mifune&#x27;s seemingly-nameless rōnin in &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

Mifune may also be credited with originating the yakuza archetype, with his performance as a mobster in Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (1948), the first yakuza film. Most of the sixteen Kurosawa–Mifune films are considered cinema classics. These include &quot;Drunken Angel&quot;, &quot;Stray Dog&quot;, &quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, &quot;High and Low&quot;, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; (an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;), &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, and &quot;Sanjuro&quot;.

Mifune and Kurosawa finally parted ways after &quot;Red Beard&quot;. Several factors contributed to the rift that ended this career-spanning collaboration. Mifune had a passion for film in his own right and had long wanted to set up a production company, working towards going freelance. Kurosawa and Taniguchi advised against it out of concern they would not be able to cast Mifune as freely. Most of Mifune&#x27;s contemporaries acted in several different movies in this period. Since &quot;Red Beard&quot; required Mifune to grow a natural beard — one he had to keep for the entirety of the film&#x27;s two years of shooting — he was unable to act in any other films during the production. This put Mifune and his financially strapped production company deeply into debt, creating friction between him and Kurosawa. Although &quot;Red Beard&quot; played to packed houses in Japan and Europe, which helped Mifune recoup some of his losses, the ensuing years held varying outcomes for both Mifune and Kurosawa. After the film&#x27;s release, the careers of each man took different arcs: Mifune continued to enjoy success with a range of samurai and war-themed films (&quot;Rebellion&quot;, &quot;Samurai Assassin&quot;, &quot;The Emperor and a General&quot;, among others). In contrast, Kurosawa&#x27;s output of films dwindled and drew mixed responses. During this time, Kurosawa attempted suicide. In 1980, Mifune experienced popularity with mainstream American audiences through his role as Lord Toranaga in the television miniseries &quot;Shogun&quot;, which Kurosawa criticised for its historical inaccuracy. Mifune spoke respectfully of Kurosawa and loyally attended the premiere of &quot;Kagemusha&quot;.

Mifune turned down an opportunity from United Artists to play the Japanese spy chief Tiger Tanaka in the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967). According to his daughter, he also turned down an offer from George Lucas to play either Darth Vader or Obi-Wan Kenobi in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Mifune was considered for the role of Spock&#x27;s nemesis in the unproduced &quot;Star Trek&quot; film &quot;Star Trek: Planet of the Titans&quot;.

Mifune himself was always professional, memorizing all of his lines and not carrying scripts on set. He was seen as unusually humble for an international star, and was known for treating his co-stars and crew generously, throwing catered parties for them and paying for their families to go to &quot;onsen&quot; resorts. When American actor Scott Glenn was asked about his experience of filming &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1982) alongside Mifune, Glenn recalled disappointment that the original script (about &quot;a surrogate father and son finding each other from completely different cultures&quot;) lost its &quot;character-driven scenes&quot; and was reduced to &quot;a martial arts movie&quot; but stated, &quot;...I remember Mifune came to me, and he said, &quot;Look, this is what&#x27;s happening. I&#x27;m disappointed, and I know you are, but this is what it is. So you can either have your heart broken every day, or you can use this experience as an opportunity to be spending time in the most interesting time in Japan and let me be your tour guide.&quot; So it wound up with me learning an awful lot of stuff from Toshirô.&quot;

In 1979, Mifune joined the ensemble cast of the Steven Spielberg war comedy &quot;1941&quot; as the commander of a lost Imperial Japanese Navy submarine searching for Hollywood shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack. Mifune received wide acclaim in the West after playing Toranaga in the 1980 TV miniseries &quot;Shogun&quot;. However, the series&#x27; blunt portrayal of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the greatly abridged version shown in Japan meant that it was not as well received in his homeland.

The relationship between Kurosawa and Mifune remained ambivalent. Kurosawa criticized Mifune&#x27;s acting in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine and also said that &quot;All the films that I made with Mifune, without him, they would not exist&quot;. He also presented Mifune with the Kawashita award which he himself had won two years prior. They frequently encountered each other professionally and met again in 1993 at the funeral of their friend Ishirō Honda, but never collaborated again.

==Personal life==
Among Mifune&#x27;s fellow performers, one of the 32 women chosen during the new faces contest was Sachiko Yoshimine. Eight years Mifune&#x27;s junior, she came from a respected Tokyo family. They fell in love and Mifune soon proposed marriage.

Director Senkichi Taniguchi, with the help of Akira Kurosawa, convinced the Yoshimine family to allow the marriage. The wedding took place in February 1950 at the Aoyama Gakuin Methodist Church. Yoshimine was a Buddhist but since Mifune was a Christian, they were married in church as per Christian tradition.

In November of the same year, their first son, Shirō was born. In 1955, they had a second son, Takeshi. Mifune&#x27;s daughter was born to his mistress, actress Mika Kitagawa, in 1982. 


In 1992, Mifune began suffering from a serious unknown health problem. It has been variously suggested that he destroyed his health with overwork, suffered a heart attack, or experienced a stroke. He retreated from public life and remained largely confined to his home, cared for by his estranged wife Sachiko. When she died from pancreatic cancer in 1995, Mifune&#x27;s physical and mental state declined rapidly.

===Death===
On December 24, 1997, he died in Mitaka, Tokyo, of multiple organ failure at the age of 77.

===Honors===
Mifune won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor twice, in 1961 and 1965. He was awarded the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon in 1986 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1993. In 1973, he was a member of the jury at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1977, he was a member of the jury at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival.

On November 14, 2016, Mifune received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in the motion picture industry.

==Personal quotations==
Of Akira Kurosawa, Toshiro Mifune said, &quot;I have never as an actor done anything that I am proud of other than with him&quot;.
&quot;Since I came into the industry very inexperienced, I don&#x27;t have any theory of acting. I just had to play my roles my way.&quot;

&quot;Generally speaking, most East–West stories have been a series of cliches. I, for one, have no desire to retell &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;.&quot;

&quot;An actor is not a puppet with strings pulled by the director. He is a human being with seeds of all emotions, desires, and needs within himself. I attempt to find the very center of this humanity and explore and experiment.&quot;

==Legacy==
Of Toshiro Mifune, in his 1991 book &quot;Cult Movie Stars&quot;, Danny Peary wrote,

Vastly talented, charismatic, and imposing (because of his strong voice and physique), the star of most of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s classics became the first Japanese actor since Sessue Hayakawa to have international fame. But where Hayakawa became a sex symbol because he was romantic, exotic, and suavely charming (even when playing lecherous villains), Mifune&#x27;s sex appeal – and appeal to male viewers – was due to his sheer unrefined and uninhibited masculinity. He was attractive even when he was unshaven and unwashed, drunk, wide-eyed, and openly scratching himself all over his sweaty body, as if he were a flea-infested dog. He did indeed have animal magnetism – in fact, he based his wild, growling, scratching, superhyper Samurai recruit in &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; on a lion. It shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten that Mifune was terrific in Kurosawa&#x27;s contemporary social dramas, as detectives or doctors, wearing suits and ties, but he will always be remembered for his violent and fearless, funny, morally ambivalent samurai heroes for Kurosawa, as well as in Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s classic epic, &quot;The Samurai Trilogy&quot;.

Peary also wrote,

Amazingly physical, [Mifune] was a supreme action hero whose bloody, ritualistic, and, ironically, sometimes comical sword-fight sequences in &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Sanjuro&quot; are classics, as well-choreographed as the greatest movie dances. His nameless sword-for-hire anticipated Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &#x27;Man With No Name&#x27; gunfighter. With his intelligence, eyes seemingly in back of his head, and experience evident in every thrust or slice, he has no trouble – and no pity – dispatching twenty opponents at a time (Bruce Lee must have been watching!). It is a testament to his skills as an actor that watching the incredible swordplay does not thrill us any more than watching his face during the battle or just the way he moves, without a trace of panic, across the screen – for no one walks or races with more authority, arrogance, or grace than Mifune&#x27;s barefoot warriors. For a 20-year period, there was no greater actor – dynamic or action – than Toshiro Mifune. Just look at his credits.

In an article published in 2020 by The Criterion Collection in commemoration of Mifune&#x27;s centenary of birth, Moeko Fujii wrote,

For most of the past century, when people thought of a Japanese man, they saw Toshiro Mifune. A samurai, in the world&#x27;s eyes, has Mifune&#x27;s fast wrists, his scruff, his sidelong squint... He may have played warriors, but they weren&#x27;t typical heroes: they threw tantrums and fits, accidentally slipped off mangy horses, yawned, scratched, chortled, and lazed. But when he extended his right arm, quick and low with a blade, he somehow summoned the tone of epics.

There&#x27;s a tendency to make Mifune sound mythical. The leading man of Kurosawa-&quot;gumi&quot;, the Emperor&#x27;s coterie, he would cement his superstar status in over 150 films in his lifetime, acting for other famed directors — Hiroshi Inagaki, Kajiro Yamamoto, Kihachi Okamoto — in roles ranging from a caped lover to a Mexican bandit.

Mifune&#x27;s life on-screen centers solely around men. Women, when they do appear, feel arbitrary, mythical, temporary: it&#x27;s clear that no one is really invested in the thrums of heterosexual desire... Toshiro Mifune cemented his reputation as an icon of masculinity right alongside Hollywood narratives of neutered Asian manhood. In 1961, Mifune provoked worldwide longing by swaggering around in &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, the same year that Mickey Rooney played the bucktoothed Mr. Yunioshi in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. Looks-wise, he&#x27;s the opposite of his predecessor, the silent film star Sessue Hayakawa — often christened the &quot;first Hollywood sex symbol&quot; — with his long, slim fingers and Yves Saint Laurent polish. But Mifune represents a development beyond Hayakawa&#x27;s Japanese-man-on-screen, who, despite his huge white female fanbase, was always limited to roles of the &quot;Oriental&quot; villain, the menace, the impossible romantic lead: in 1957, Joe Franklin would tell Hayakawa in his talk show, &quot;There were two things we were sure of in the silent movie era; the Indians never got the best of it, and Sessue Hayakawa never got the girl.&quot;

Mifune never wants the girl in the first place. So the men around him can&#x27;t help but watch him a little open-mouthed, as he walks his slice of world, amused by and nonchalant about the stupor he leaves in his wake. &quot;Who is he?,&quot; someone asks, and no one ever has a good answer. You can&#x27;t help but want to walk alongside him, to figure it out.

==Filmography==
Mifune appeared in roughly 170 feature films. In 2015, Steven Okazaki released &quot;&quot;, a documentary chronicling Mifune&#x27;s life and career. Due to variations in translation from the Japanese and other factors, there are multiple titles to many of Mifune&#x27;s films (see IMDb link). The titles shown here are the most common ones used in the United States, with the original Japanese title listed below it in parentheses. Mifune&#x27;s filmography mainly consists of Japanese productions, unless noted otherwise (see Notes column).

===Films===
The 1999 Danish film Mifune is named after the actor.

===Television===
All programs originally aired in Japan except for &quot;Shōgun&quot; which aired in the U.S. on NBC in September 1980 before being subsequently broadcast in Japan on TV Asahi from March 30 to April 6, 1981.
==Awards and nominations==
Mifune won and was nominated for many awards during his acting career, including six Blue Ribbon Awards, three Mainichi Film Awards, three Japan Academy Film Prize nominations (winning two), and two &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; Awards.

<text>The Town of Adams is located in Green County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 464 at the 2000 Census. Willet, now a ghost town, was located in Adams.

==History==
The earliest settlers were Cornish lead miners; they were followed by settlers from New England, Ireland, Switzerland and Norway. The town has been the home of a Lutheran and a Catholic parish. Saint Francis Catholic Church was formed and built by Catholic immigrants from Ireland, but later merged with Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Argyle, Wisconsin, and the church was eventually torn down; only the cemetery remains.

Adams Lutheran Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), was formed by Norwegian immigrants from the Valdres and Hadeland areas of Norway and was originally served by clergy of the Church of Norway. It later became a member of the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Under the increasing influence of the Haugean pietist movement among Norwegian American clergy and parishes, it joined a group originally called the Friends of Augsburg, which subsequently became the Lutheran Free Church. Later, when it began to call its pastors from clergy of The American Lutheran Church, it became a member of that body. It became a member of the ELCA when the American Lutheran Church merged with two other Lutheran synods.

The original church was built by the first parishioners during the American Civil War from limestone quarried from a site below the ridge on which the church stood. Later, the inside walls of the sanctuary were covered with a darkly varnished wooden wainscoting) of a very distinctive herringbone pattern. After serving the parish for almost a century and a half, the church burned and a new one was built on a site immediately adjacent to the original within a year.

<text>Brodhead is a city in Green and Rock counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 3,274 at the 2020 census. In February 2000, the city annexed a portion of land from the Town of Spring Valley in Rock County.

==History==
Just south of town is a historic marker for the Half-Way Tree, a bur oak supposedly identified by Native Americans as the halfway point on a foot trail between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. Present day experts say the tree is off by about six miles but there is also a disagreement about the methods of measurement. The half-way tree still stands protected and still marks the half-way point. 

The railroad track that runs east and west through town features a small museum with a train and army tank on display, adjacent to the park and bandstand pavilion. The museum curator said that the railroad was being wooed by two different towns and decided to split the difference and created Brodhead in the spring of 1856.

The town was named in honor of the chief engineer of the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad, Edward Hallock Brodhead (1809–1890), who was among the earliest promoters of the railway depot. The initial street names of the town were platted after the surnames of the landowners, eventually changed to numerical titles to reflect practical purposes.

Other cofounders include: Edmund Deacon Clinton (1804–1885), Isaac Foster Mack (1806–1886), John P. Dixon, John Lucas Vischer Thomas (1825–1917), John L. McNair (1809–1877), Edmund Abbott West (1823–1922) and Erastus M. Smith.

A nearby raceway was dredged off of a branch of the Sugar River that diverted a long canal to a hydroelectric generator that supplied electricity to the town. This gave Brodhead the distinction of having electrical service before other larger cities such as Chicago, and perhaps the first electrical service in Wisconsin.

The first settlement, within the limits now comprising the town of Jordan, was made by William Brazel. In 1836, he raised the first corn and in 1837 raised the first crop of wheat in the township. Others to follow him were: John and George Shelton from Virginia in 1836, Lars Larson Bothan from Norway in 1843, brothers Ole Iverson from Vik, Norway in 1843 and Axel Iverson from Voss, Norway in 1844, Curtis Hard and Henry Crary in 1845. At the junction of Jordan Creek and the Pecatonica River, the early settlers believed there would some day be a city. Steamboats came up the river to that point in 1845.

<doc id="139114" wikidata="Q57346" url="?curid=139114" title="Defensive wall">
<text>A defensive wall is a fortification usually used to protect a city, town or other settlement from potential aggressors. The walls can range from simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications such as curtain walls with towers, bastions and gates for access to the city. From ancient to modern times, they were used to enclose settlements. Generally, these are referred to as city walls or town walls, although there were also walls, such as the Great Wall of China, Walls of Benin, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, Anastasian Wall, and the Atlantic Wall, which extended far beyond the borders of a city and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries. In mountainous terrain, defensive walls such as &quot;letzis&quot; were used in combination with castles to seal valleys from potential attack. Beyond their defensive utility, many walls also had important symbolic functions representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced.

Existing ancient walls are almost always masonry structures, although brick and timber-built variants are also known. Depending on the topography of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect, elements of the terrain such as rivers or coastlines may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective.

Walls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate city gate and are often supplemented with towers. The practice of building these massive walls, though having its origins in prehistory, was refined during the rise of city-states, and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe.

Simpler defensive walls of earth or stone, thrown up around hillforts, ringworks, early castles and the like, tend to be referred to as ramparts or banks.

== History ==


===Mesopotamia===

From very early history to modern times, walls have been a near necessity for every city. Uruk in ancient Sumer (Mesopotamia) is one of the world&#x27;s oldest known walled cities. Before that, the proto-city of Jericho in the West Bank had a wall surrounding it as early as the 8th millenniumBC. The earliest known town wall in Europe is of Solnitsata, built in the 6th or 5th millennium BC.

The Assyrians deployed large labour forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls.

Babylon was one of the most famous cities of the ancient world, especially as a result of the building program of Nebuchadnezzar, who expanded the walls and built the Ishtar Gate.

The Persians built defensive walls to protect their territories, notably the Derbent Wall and the Great Wall of Gorgan built on the either sides of the Caspian Sea against nomadic nations.

===South Asia===
Some settlements in the Indus Valley civilization were also fortified. By about 3500BC, hundreds of small farming villages dotted the Indus floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of Kot Diji were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities quarreled constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. Mundigak () in present-day south-east Afghanistan has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks.

=== Southeast Asia ===
The concept of a city fully enclosed by walls was not fully developed in Southeast Asia until the arrival of Europeans. However, Burma serves an exception, as they had a longer tradition of fortified walled towns; towns in Burma had city walls by 1566. Besides that, Rangoon in 1755 had stockades made of teak logs on a ground rampart. The city was fortified with six city gates with each gate flanked by massive brick towers.

In other areas of Southeast Asia, city walls spread in the 16th and 17th century along with the rapid growth of cities in this period as a need to defend against European naval attack. Ayutthaya built its walls in 1550 and Banten, Jepara, Tuban and Surabaya all had theirs by 1600; while Makassar had theirs by 1634. A sea wall was the main defense for Gelgel. For cities that did not have city walls, the least it would have had was a stockaded citadel. This wooden walled area housed the royal citadel or aristocratic compounds such as in Surakarta and Aceh.

===China===
Large rammed earth walls were built in ancient China since the Shang dynasty (–1050BC), as the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see siege for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the Warring States (481–221BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Sections of the Great Wall had been built prior to the Qin dynasty (221–207BC) and subsequently connected and fortified during the Qin dynasty, although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644AD). The large walls of Pingyao serve as one example. Likewise, the walls of the Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor. According to Tonio Andrade, the immense thickness of Chinese city walls prevented larger cannons from being developed, since even industrial era artillery had trouble breaching Chinese walls.

===Korea===

Eupseongs (Hangul: 읍성), &#x27;city fortresses&#x27;, which served both military and administrative functions, have been constructed since the time of Silla until the end of the Joseon dynasty. Throughout the period of the Joseon dynasty eupseongs were modified and renovated, and new eupseongs were built, but in 1910 Japan (the occupying power of Korea) issued an order for their demolition, resulting in most being destroyed. Studies of the ruins and reconstructions of the ancient city walls are currently being undertaken at some sites.

===Europe===
In ancient Greece, large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece, such as the ancient site of Mycenae (famous for the huge stone blocks of its &#x27;cyclopean&#x27; walls). In classical era Greece, the city of Athens built a long set of parallel stone walls called the Long Walls that reached their guarded seaport at Piraeus. Exceptions were few, but neither ancient Sparta nor ancient Rome had walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without mortar.

The Romans later fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. Among these are the largely extant Aurelian Walls of Rome and the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the Porta Nigra in Trier or Newport Arch in Lincoln.

In Central Europe, the Celts built large fortified settlements which the Romans called oppida, whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean. The fortifications were continuously expanded and improved.

Apart from these, the early Middle Ages also saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and ditches. From the 12th century AD hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, which very often obtained the right of fortification soon afterwards. Several medieval town walls have survived into the modern age, such as the walled towns of Austria, walls of Tallinn, or the town walls of York and Canterbury in England, as well as Nordlingen, Dinkelsbühl and Rothenburg ob der Tauber in Germany. In Spain, Ávila and Tossa del Mar hosts surviving medieval walls while Lugo has an intact Roman wall.

The founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in central and eastern Europe, were founded for this purpose during the period of Eastern settlement. These cities are easy to recognise due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development.

===Gunpowder era===
====Chinese city walls====

While gunpowder and cannons were invented in China, China never developed wall breaking artillery to the same extent as other parts of the world. Part of the reason is probably because Chinese walls were already highly resistant to artillery and discouraged increasing the size of cannons. In the mid-twentieth century a European expert in fortification commented on their immensity: &quot;in China ... the principal towns are surrounded to the present day by walls so substantial, lofty, and formidable that the medieval fortifications of Europe are puny in comparison.&quot; Chinese walls were thick. The eastern wall of Ancient Linzi, established in 859 BC, had a maximum thickness of 43 metres and an average thickness of 20–30 metres. Ming prefectural and provincial capital walls were thick at the base and at the top.

In Europe the height of wall construction was reached under the Roman Empire, whose walls often reached in height, the same as many Chinese city walls, but were only thick. Rome&#x27;s Servian Walls reached in thickness and in height. Other fortifications also reached these specifications across the empire, but all these paled in comparison to contemporary Chinese walls, which could reach a thickness of at the base in extreme cases. Even the walls of Constantinople which have been described as &quot;the most famous and complicated system of defence in the civilized world,&quot; could not match up to a major Chinese city wall. Had both the outer and inner walls of Constantinople been combined they would have only reached roughly a bit more than a third the width of a major wall in China. According to Philo the width of a wall had to be thick to be able to withstand ancient (non-gunpowder) siege engines. European walls of the 1200s and 1300s could reach the Roman equivalents but rarely exceeded them in length, width, and height, remaining around thick. When referring to a very thick wall in medieval Europe, what is usually meant is a wall of in width, which would have been considered thin in a Chinese context. There are some exceptions such as the Hillfort of Otzenhausen, a Celtic ringfort with a thickness of in some parts, but Celtic fort-building practices died out in the early medieval period. Andrade goes on to note that the walls of the &quot;marketplace&quot; of Chang&#x27;an were thicker than the walls of major European capitals.

Aside from their immense size, Chinese walls were also structurally different from the ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were mostly constructed of stone interspersed with gravel or rubble filling and bonded by limestone mortar, Chinese walls had tamped earthen cores which absorbed the energy of artillery shots. Walls were constructed using wooden frameworks which were filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, and once that was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent erosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble. Most Chinese walls were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.

The Chinese Wall Theory essentially rests on a cost benefit hypothesis, where the Ming recognized the highly resistant nature of their walls to structural damage, and could not imagine any affordable development of the guns available to them at the time to be capable of breaching said walls. Even as late as the 1490s a Florentine diplomat considered the French claim that &quot;their artillery is capable of creating a breach in a wall of eight feet in thickness&quot; to be ridiculous and the French &quot;braggarts by nature&quot;. Very rarely did cannons blast breaches in city walls in Chinese warfare. This may have been partly due to cultural tradition. Famous military commanders such as Sun Tzu and Zheng Zhilong recommended not to directly attack cities and storm their walls. Even when direct assaults were made with cannons, it was usually by focusing on the gates rather than the walls. There were instances where cannons were used against walled fortifications, such as by Koxinga, but only in the case of small villages. During Koxinga&#x27;s career, there is only one recorded case of capturing a settlement by bombarding its walls: the siege of Taizhou in 1658. In 1662, the Dutch found that bombarding the walls of a town in Fujian Province had no effect and they focused on the gates instead just as in Chinese warfare. In 1841, a 74-gun British warship bombarded a Chinese coastal fort near Guangzhou and found that it was &quot;almost impervious to the efforts of horizontal fire.&quot; In fact &quot;twentieth&quot; century explosive shells had some difficulty creating a breach in tamped earthen walls.

====Bastions and star forts====


As a response to gunpowder artillery, European fortifications began displaying architectural principles such as lower and thicker walls in the mid-1400s. Cannon towers were built with artillery rooms where cannons could discharge fire from slits in the walls. However, this proved problematic as the slow rate of fire, reverberating concussions, and noxious fumes produced greatly hindered defenders. Gun towers also limited the size and number of cannon placements because the rooms could only be built so big. Notable surviving artillery towers include a seven layer defensive structure built in 1480 at Fougères in Brittany, and a four layer tower built in 1479 at Querfurth in Saxony.

The star fort, also known as the bastion fort, &quot;trace italienne&quot;, or renaissance fortress, was a style of fortification that became popular in Europe during the 16th century. The bastion and star fort was developed in Italy, where the Florentine engineer Giuliano da Sangallo (1445–1516) compiled a comprehensive defensive plan using the geometric bastion and full &quot;trace italienne&quot; that became widespread in Europe.

The main distinguishing features of the star fort were its angle bastions, each placed to support their neighbor with lethal crossfire, covering all angles, making them extremely difficult to engage with and attack. Angle bastions consisted of two faces and two flanks. Artillery positions positioned at the flanks could fire parallel into the opposite bastion&#x27;s line of fire, thus providing two lines of cover fire against an armed assault on the wall, and preventing mining parties from finding refuge. Meanwhile, artillery positioned on the bastion platform could fire frontally from the two faces, also providing overlapping fire with the opposite bastion. Overlapping mutually supporting defensive fire was the greatest advantage enjoyed by the star fort. As a result, sieges lasted longer and became more difficult affairs. By the 1530s the bastion fort had become the dominant defensive structure in Italy.

Outside Europe, the star fort became an &quot;engine of European expansion,&quot; and acted as a force multiplier so that small European garrisons could hold out against numerically superior forces. Wherever star forts were erected the natives experienced great difficulty in uprooting European invaders.

In China, Sun Yuanhua advocated for the construction of angled bastion forts in his &quot;Xifashenji&quot; so that their cannons could better support each other. The officials Han Yun and Han Lin noted that cannons on square forts could not support each side as well as bastion forts. Their efforts to construct bastion forts, and their results, were limited. Ma Weicheng built two bastion forts in his home county, which helped fend off a Qing incursion in 1638. By 1641, there were ten bastion forts in the county. Before bastion forts could spread any further, the Ming dynasty fell in 1644, and they were largely forgotten as the Qing dynasty was on the offensive most of the time and had no use for them.

=== Decline ===
In the wake of city growth and the ensuing change of defensive strategy, focusing more on the defense of forts around cities, many city walls were demolished. Also, the invention of gunpowder rendered walls less effective, as siege cannons could then be used to blast through walls, allowing armies to simply march through. Today, the presence of former city fortifications can often only be deduced from the presence of ditches, ring roads or parks.

Furthermore, some street names hint at the presence of fortifications in times past, for example when words such as &quot;wall&quot; or &quot;glacis&quot; occur.

In the 19th century, less emphasis was placed on preserving the fortifications for the sake of their architectural or historical value on the one hand, complete fortifications were restored (Carcassonne), on the other hand many structures were demolished in an effort to modernize the cities. One exception to this is the &quot;monument preservation&quot; law by the Bavarian King Ludwig I of Bavaria, which led to the nearly complete preservation of many monuments such as the Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Nördlingen and Dinkelsbühl. The countless small fortified towns in the Franconia region were also preserved as a consequence of this edict.

=== Modern era ===
Walls and fortified wall structures were still built in the modern era. They did not, however, have the original purpose of being a structure able to resist a prolonged siege or bombardment. Modern examples of defensive walls include:

* Berlin&#x27;s city wall from the 1730s to the 1860s was partially made of wood. Its primary purpose was to enable the city to impose tolls on goods and, secondarily, also served to prevent the desertion of soldiers from the garrison in Berlin. 
* The Berlin Wall (1961 to 1989) did not exclusively serve the purpose of protection of an enclosed settlement. One of its purposes was to prevent the crossing of the Berlin border between the German Democratic Republic and the West German exclave of west-Berlin.
* The Korean Demilitarized Zone that divides North Korea and South Korea near the 38th parallel north. 
* The Nicosia Wall along the Green Line divides North and South Cyprus.
* In the 20th century and after, many enclaved Jewish settlements in Israeli occupied territory in the West Bank were and are surrounded by fortified walls
* Mexico–United States barrier, a wall advocated by U.S. President Donald Trump for the Mexico–United States border to prevent illegal immigration, drug smuggling, human trafficking, and entry of potential terrorists
* Belfast, Northern Ireland by the &quot;peace lines&quot;.
* Gated communities are modern residential neighborhoods where access is controlled, often prohibiting through-travelers or non-residents via a wall and guards

Additionally, in some countries, different embassies may be grouped together in a single &quot;embassy district&quot;, enclosed by a fortified complex with walls and towersthis usually occurs in regions where the embassies run a high risk of being target of attacks. An early example of such a compound was the Legation Quarter in Beijing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Most of these modern city walls are made of steel and concrete. Vertical concrete plates are put together so as to allow the least space in between them, and are rooted firmly in the ground. The top of the wall is often protruding and beset with barbed wire in order to make climbing them more difficult. These walls are usually built in straight lines and covered by watchtowers at the corners. Double walls with an interstitial &quot;zone of fire&quot;, as the former Berlin Wall had, are now rare.

In September 2014, Ukraine announced the construction of the &quot;European Rampart&quot; alongside its border with Russia to be able to successfully apply for a visa-free movement with the European Union.

== Composition ==
At its simplest, a defensive wall consists of a wall enclosure and its gates. For the most part, the top of the walls were accessible, with the outside of the walls having tall parapets with embrasures or merlons. North of the Alps, this passageway at the top of the walls occasionally had a roof.

In addition to this, many different enhancements were made over the course of the centuries:

* City ditch: a ditch dug in front of the walls, occasionally filled with water to form a moat.
* Gate tower: a tower built next to, or on top of the city gates to better defend the city gates.
* Wall tower: a tower built on top of a segment of the wall, which usually extended outwards slightly, so as to be able to observe the exterior of the walls on either side. In addition to arrow slits, ballistae, catapults and cannons could be mounted on top for extra defence.
* Pre-wall: wall built outside the wall proper, usually of lesser height the space in between was usually further subdivided by additional walls.
* Additional obstacles in front of the walls.

The defensive towers of west and south European fortifications in the Middle Ages were often very regularly and uniformly constructed (cf. Ávila, Provins), whereas Central European city walls tend to show a variety of different styles. In these cases the gate and wall towers often reach up to considerable heights, and gates equipped with two towers on either side are much rarer. Apart from having a purely military and defensive purpose, towers also played a representative and artistic role in the conception of a fortified complex. The architecture of the city thus competed with that of the castle of the noblemen and city walls were often a manifestation of the pride of a particular city.

Urban areas outside the city walls, so-called Vorstädte, were often enclosed by their own set of walls and integrated into the defense of the city. These areas were often inhabited by the poorer population and held the &quot;noxious trades&quot;. In many cities, a new wall was built once the city had grown outside of the old wall. This can often still be seen in the layout of the city, for example in Nördlingen, and sometimes even a few of the old gate towers are preserved, such as the &quot;white tower&quot; in Nuremberg. Additional constructions prevented the circumvention of the city, through which many important trade routes passed, thus ensuring that tolls were paid when the caravans passed through the city gates, and that the local market was visited by the trade caravans.
Furthermore, additional signaling and observation towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The border of the area of influence of the city was often partially or fully defended by elaborate ditches, walls and hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates or gate houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their area of influence. An example of this practice is the Romanian Bran Castle, which was intended to protect nearby Kronstadt (today&#x27;s Braşov).

The city walls were often connected to the fortifications of hill castles via additional walls. Thus the defenses were made up of city and castle fortifications taken together. Several examples of this are preserved, for example in Germany Hirschhorn on the Neckar, Königsberg and Pappenheim, Franken, Burghausen in Oberbayern and many more.
A few castles were more directly incorporated into the defensive strategy of the city (e.g. Nuremberg, Zons, Carcassonne), or the cities were directly outside the castle as a sort of &quot;pre-castle&quot; (Coucy-le-Chateau, Conwy and others). Larger cities often had multiple stewards for example Augsburg was divided into a Reichstadt and a clerical city. These different parts were often separated by their own fortifications.

<text>York is a town in Green County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 910 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated community of Postville is located in the town. The ghost town of Farmers Grove was also located in the town.

==History==
York’s first settlers came to its southeastern sections beginning in 1838 or 1840. Many of these people were “Yankees” from New York, so when Wisconsin became a state in 1848, the Town of York was named after these settlers who came from “York State.” The first election of a township board was two years later in 1850. Many of these early pioneers are buried in Green’s Prairie Cemetery, but even more moved farther West within the next thirty years. Westward movement was the resounding mentality of the day.

Beginning in 1851, Norwegians began to settle in the northern and western portions of the township where the hills and valleys were more wooded and rugged. This area had been settled more sparsely by the Yankees, leaving government land for the Norwegians to purchase. The hills and valleys reminded the Norwegian of home, even if it was not a conscious factor for settling here. Many hilltops were prairie, something unusual to them, but the wooded hillsides and valleys with their curves and creeks were familiar. The land was fertile and comparably rock-free, but it was the water quality of the area that may have held the strongest draw.

The Norwegian population of York was part of the historic Norwegian Blue Mounds settlement, part of a contiguous settlement of Norwegians, connecting with Perry and Primrose in Dane County northward through Springdale, Blue Mounds, and Vermont; Moscow in Iowa County; Blanchard in Lafayette County; and Town of Adams in Green County. The Towns of York and Perry formed the most ethnically concentrated portion of this settlement. There were problems with malaria in some earlier Norwegian settlements of Muskego and the Fox River Valley in Illinois and, therefore, flat land, something already conceptually strange to Norwegians, gained a tarnished reputation through an association with swamps, unclean stagnant water, and disease. In York and the Driftless Area, the water gushed out of the hills in a constant flow of bountiful springs. The Norwegians came here with their health and comfort in mind.

In 1855, a Norwegian Lutheran congregation in York formed and, in 1861, they began to build their church at the intersection of what is now Hwys 39 and 78. The Norwegian Lutherans eventually decided they could not agree upon the subject of predestination and the congregation split in two. Another church was then built across the road in 1885. The two churches eventually became known as “Old York” and “York Memorial.”

Meanwhile, Yankee inhabitants built two churches in Postville in 1868. One was for a Free-Will Baptist Society and the other was for a Methodist congregation that had been conducting services in the township since 1842.

A sawmill was in operation from 1855-1868 on the east bank of Sawmill Creek where Sawmill Road crosses. As homesteads were claimed and structures were built, the sawmill provided lumber.

There were three post offices in the Town of York by the turn of the twentieth century: Stewart (located in Postville), Ula (at the Ula farm), and Bem (at Strahm’s Corners: the intersection of Hwy 39 and County J). The first post office was called Farmer’s Grove and established in 1846. Its location moved several times with changes in postmasters who each operated out of their homes, so it eventually ended up in Town of Adams. Bem opened next in 1850, followed by Stewart in 1862, and Ula in 1889. Mail was brought from Mineral Point through the Town of Moscow to these stations by stagecoach on the way to Monroe. Post offices were consolidated between 1900 and 1904 and rural route deliveries out of Blanchardville, New Glarus, Daleyville, and Mount Horeb then began to serve most York residents.

The main industry for all the settlers was wheat farming until chinch bugs, overused soil, and lowered prices caused its profitability to drop significantly in the 1870s. Dairy farming, specifically for cheese production, became the saving grace for farmers. Between 1876 and 1888, a cheese factory was built in nearly every valley. These factories brought Swiss cheesemakers into the township and Swiss farmers had already begun settling properties on the eastern end of the township where it connects with the Town of New Glarus. There were at least fourteen cheese factories: York Prairie, York Prairie Valley, Steppe Valley, Makepeace, Brager, York Center, Poplar Grove, Hay Hollow, Blue Ribbon, Sawmill, Postville, Farmer’s Grove, Vinger, and Strommen.

After only seven documented residents in 1840, there were 904 by 1860. The Town of York reached its peak population in 1870 when there were 1,088 residents. The population was not stagnant as many continued their westward journey to homestead-able land, but thanks to continued immigration from especially Norway, but also Switzerland, the numbers stayed more-or-less steady until 1900. After 1900, a noticeable decline in population began, largely due to smaller familial units and migration into villages and cities. The population continued to decrease until York reached a low point of 509 residents in 1990.

==1984 F5 Tornado==

At 12:41 AM CDT on June 8, 1984, a powerful tornado tore through Barneveld. It was part of a large outbreak of storms that started the evening before with tornadoes also touching down in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota. Although a tornado watch had been issued late on the night of June 7, most residents were unaware that a storm was approaching until they were awakened by a lightning strike and an instantaneous clap of thunder just before 12:41 AM CDT. The 0.4-mile (0.60-km) wide tornado caused F5 damage, the highest level on the Fujita scale. Two hundred of the village&#x27;s 584 residents were injured and nine were killed. Seventeen of the 18 businesses in Barneveld were destroyed, including all the government offices, the fire station, library, and post office. The town&#x27;s three churches were all flattened: the Congregational United Church of Christ, pastor Rev. Jann Cather Weaver, the Lutheran Church, pastor Rev. Robert Twiton, and the Roman Catholic Church. The Congregational UCC church also lost its parsonage. In all, about 170 of the village&#x27;s 225 commercial, agricultural, and residential buildings were either destroyed instantly or damaged seriously enough that they were unable to be rebuilt. The only remaining and largely undamaged structure was the water tower, which had to be repaired and repainted. Damage to the village of Barneveld was estimated at $25 million with damage to the surrounding area put at about $40 million. Rebuilding began immediately, and by 2000, the population of Barneveld was almost exactly double what it was at the time the tornado nearly destroyed the town. The thunderstorm that created the tornado also put on one of the brightest lightning shows in recorded history, generating 200 strikes per minute.

<text>Hurley is a city in and the county seat of Iron County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,558 at the 2020 census. It is located directly across the Montreal River from Ironwood, Michigan.

==History==

Hurley is located on the Montreal River, the border between Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The city is on U.S. Highway 2 (US 2), and is the northern terminus of US 51, and is about south of Lake Superior. Hurley had its origins in the iron mining and lumbering booms of the 1880s. The city is located, along with adjacent Ironwood, Michigan, at the center of the Gogebic Range. The economy of Hurley, together with the city of Montreal in Wisconsin, and the cities of Ironwood, Bessemer and Wakefield in Michigan, was dependent upon the extraction of iron ore from the Gogebic (a/k/a Penokee) Range during the 19th and 20th centuries.

Hurley took its name from Canadian-born M. A. Hurley, a prominent attorney of Wausau who won a lawsuit for the Northern Chief Iron Company in 1884. The compensation for winning the lawsuit was that he asked for no fee, but only requested that the town involved in the case be named after him. M.A. Hurley held stock in the Northern Chief Iron Company. The full name &quot;Glen Hurley&quot; was used for one year, but in 1885, the first name was dropped and the community became known as Hurley. The first Plat Map of Glen Hurley was recorded in the Ashland County Register of Deeds by C.N. Nutter, surveyor for the Northern Chief Iron Company of Wausau, in December 1884.

Hurley did not become a city until April 1918. Previously, it was part of the town of Vaughn, named after Samuel S. Vaughn, pioneer resident of Ashland, for whom the Vaughn Public Library is named. When the city of Hurley was created, the town of Vaughn was dissolved and divided among the City of Hurley, the Town of Oma (Finnish for &quot;Our Own&quot;), the Town of Carey, and the Town of Kimball.

Henry Meade was the first mayor of Hurley.

John Ankers opened Hurley&#x27;s first saloon and served as the first clerk for the Town of Vaughn, first Justice of the Peace, and first fire chief.

In early November 1887, ten people were killed in a fire that started in a three-story theater and spread to other structures.

The &quot;Gogebic Range Directory&quot; of 1888 states: &quot;During the past summer, Hurley was twice visited by terrible fires. The first occurred of June 28 and the second on July 9. These destroyed almost the entire business portion of the city, and at first it was thought that they would prove a crushing blow to its prosperity, but later events have proven that they were blessings in disguise. The wonderful pluck and energy of its businessmen were fully demonstrated when they at once began the erection of fine brick buildings in the place of the wooden ones destroyed. The result has been that the burned portion has been rebuilt with brick and stone, making them nearly fireproof. And Silver Street is one that a much larger city could well be proud of.&quot;

===Boundary dispute===
Hurley was at the center of a boundary dispute between Michigan and Wisconsin, culminating in a United States Supreme Court case in 1926, confirming Hurley belonging to Wisconsin. The Montreal River was mapped in detail in 1841 by Lieutenant Thomas Jefferson Cram of the United States Land Office Department of Topography. Cram was assigned by Congress to survey the northeast boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin. This boundary had been originally outlined by Congress in 1834 on the basis of the faulty maps of the time which incorrectly showed both the Montreal and Menominee rivers originating from the Lac Vieux Desert in Vilas County. After a detailed survey, Cram located the headwaters of the Montreal 55 miles west of Lac Vieux Desert, and recommended the boundary line be run from the center of the lake to the headwaters of the Montreal. Michigan brought suit against Wisconsin to correct the boundary line between the two states. Michigan&#x27;s claim included the City of Hurley and its valuable mineral deposits. Michigan&#x27;s lawsuit, &quot;Michigan v. Wisconsin&quot; (270 U.S. 295, 1926), was dismissed by the US Supreme Court on the grounds that Wisconsin&#x27;s long continued possession of the disputed property was acquiesced in by Michigan (P. 270, U.S. 301).

===Prohibition===
Hurley was a known gangster resort haven for mobsters in the twenties and thirties. According to an article in &quot;The Wisconsin Magazine of History&quot;, Hurley was the most infamous town in Wisconsin during Prohibition. &quot;Hurley: a notorious northern Wisconsin city with a long history of vice. Prohibition agents staged massive raids on Hurley, but each time the saloonkeepers paid their fines and went back to their usual business. On December 27, 1926, federal agents padlocked twenty-nine Hurley saloons in a single day. A 1931 raid closed forty-two saloons, resulting in the arrest of sixty people- one out of every forty Hurley residents. In an economy dependent on revenues from drinking, gambling, and prostitution, local officers looked the other way and the city continued its business, with routine harassment by enforcement officials. By 1929, federal officials were afoot in Wisconsin to assess changing conditions. Prohibition investigator Frank Buckley was most aghast at what he found during a visit to Hurley. He commented that Hurley &#x27;has the distinction of being the worst community in the State...Gambling, prostitution, bootlegging, and dope are about the chief occupations of the place. Saloons there function with barmaids who serve the dual capacity of soda dispenser and prostitute.&#x27;&quot;

===Radar Bomb Scoring site===
In the early 1960s, the US Air Force established a Strategic Air Command (SAC) Radar Bomb Scoring site atop Norrie Hill in neighboring Ironwood, Michigan to track and score high altitude and treetop level simulated bomb runs by B-52s and B-47s on targets in the Hurley area. A monument is erected outside of Hurley to remember six crew members who were killed in two B-47 low level runs in 1961. The Radar Bomb Scoring site was moved to Charlevoix, Michigan in the mid-1960s.

===Historic locations===
The Old Iron County Courthouse (now the Iron County Historical Museum) was designed in the Richardsonian-Romanesque style by architect L.H. Ruggles. The building was completed in 1893 by contractors Rinkle and Carroll at a cost of $27,303. The original clock in the tower was installed by Chicago jeweler J.J. Neuhavre. Lightning struck the clock tower in June 1922 and set the tower ablaze. The original clock was destroyed and was replaced by an electric Seth Thomas clock at a cost of $1,348. The building served as the county courthouse until 1975. In 1977, it was sold to the Iron County Historical Society for $1. It has been listed on the National Register for Historic Places since 1977. It was considered &quot;architecturally significant in an area where there are few comparable buildings.&quot; The building currently houses the Iron County Historical Museum, which features three floors of exhibits and a weaving room where volunteers use looms to make rag rugs.

The Iron Exchange Bank of Hurley, was the oldest bank of the Gogebic Range. It was organized on November 26, 1885. Dr. J.C. Reynolds, the bank&#x27;s first president, and his brother, W. S. Reynolds, the bank&#x27;s first cashier, were the prime movers in the organization of the institution. Associated with them in the organization were John E. Burton, Alvin E. Tyler, Edward Ryan, Nathaniel J. Moore, James A. Wood, and Shepherd Homans, all men prominent in the mining industry in the area in the early days.

The first newspaper in Hurley was the &quot;Montreal River Miner&quot; which was first published on October 8, 1885. After absorbing the &quot;Iron County News&quot; in 1950 the two papers names were merged to form the &quot;Iron County Miner&quot;, which is still published as a weekly. &quot;La Nostra Terra&quot; (&quot;Our Land&quot;), an Italian language newspaper, was published in Hurley from 1904 to 1913, when it merged into the &quot;Iron County News&quot;.

The first hotel was located at the corner of Second Avenue and Silver Street in a log building, with James Guest as the first landlord.

The Burton House was an immense four-story frame hostelry, which was a famous gathering place in the latter part of the 19th century. John E. Burton, of Lake Geneva, erected the building in 1886. A mining speculator, his original wealth came from the iron range. Later he established offices in New York City and bought up other vast mining interests in Mexico and South America. The Burton Hotel contained 100 rooms, a ballroom, dining room, café, and clubrooms, all highly decorated and furnished with the best of the woodworkers&#x27; art of the time, and equipped with the best furniture. The Burton Hotel cost $35,000 to construct, and the furniture cost Burton $10,000. Many noteworthy people stayed at the Burton House: including Benjamin Harrison, in 1888, during his campaign for president; the actress Sarah Bernhardt, who made at least three appearances in Hurley; the financier Colgate Hoyt, nephew of James Boorman Colgate, son of the British-American industrialist, Charles Colgate; the actor Edwin Booth (brother of John Wilkes Booth); and author and playwright Edna Ferber. Grover Cleveland registered at the Burton House Saturday, October 5, 1889. By that time he had already served one term as president of the United States. In 1889 when he was in Hurley, he was a New York lawyer and businessman. Cleveland was elected to the presidency again in 1892. The Burton House burned to the ground on February 2, 1947, as the result of an over-heated stove on the first floor VFW meeting room.

<text>Montreal is a city in Iron County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 801 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Montreal was originally incorporated as the Village of Hamilton, on or about 1917, and was the first village formed in Iron County.

Montreal, as it was named upon its incorporation as a city on April 1, 1924, was named for the Montreal Mining Company, which had several iron ore mines in the area during the late 1800s. During the early 1900s, miners settled near the mine shaft and leased the land from the mining company. However, in 1918, in order to retain workers, the company initiated a program that rented pre-fabricated homes to miners. The Montreal Company Location Historic District, which includes several of these company town houses, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as a national example of industrial community planning. The ore deposits left from Montreal&#x27;s mining days can still be seen from Wisconsin Highway 77.

An area iron mine operated by Oglebay Norton Corporation was, at the time of its closing in 1962, the deepest iron mine in the world, with a vertical depth of .
