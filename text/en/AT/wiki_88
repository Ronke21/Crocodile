<text>Ripon () is a cathedral city and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. The city is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure, the Laver and Skell. Within the boundaries of the historic West Riding of Yorkshire, the city is noted for its main feature, Ripon Cathedral, which is architecturally significant, as well as the Ripon Racecourse and other features such as its market.

The city was originally known as &quot;Inhrypum&quot;. Bede records that Alhfrith, king of the Southern Northumbrian kingdom of Deira, gave land at Ripon to Eata of Hexham to build a monastery and the abbot transferred some of his monks there, including a young Saint Cuthbert who was guest-master at Ripon abbey. Both Bede in his Life of Cuthbert and Eddius Stephanus in his Life of Wilfred state that when Eata was subsequently driven out by Alhfrith, the abbey was given to Saint Wilfrid who replaced the timber church with a stone built church. This was during the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria, a period during which it enjoyed prominence in religious importance in Great Britain. It was for a period under Viking control, and later suffered under the Normans. After a brief period of building projects under the Plantagenets, the city emerged with a prominent wool and cloth industry. Ripon became well known for its production of spurs during the 16th and 17th centuries, but would later remain largely unaffected by the Industrial Revolution.

Ripon is the third-smallest city in England and the smallest in Yorkshire, by population. According to the 2011 United Kingdom Census it had a population of 16,702, an increase on the 2001 United Kingdom Census figure of 15,922. It is located south-west of Thirsk, south of Northallerton and north of Harrogate. As well as its racecourse and cathedral, Ripon is a tourist destination because of its proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site which consists of the Studley Royal Park and Fountains Abbey.

==History==
===Northumbrian and Viking period===

During its pre-history the area which later became Ripon was under the control of the Brigantes, a Brythonic tribe. Three miles (5 km) north at Hutton Moor there is a large circular earthwork created by them. The Romans did not settle Ripon, but they had a military outpost around away at North Stainley. Solid evidence for the origins of Ripon can be traced back to the 7th century, the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. The first structure built in the area, known at the time as Inhrypum, was a Christian church dedicated to St Peter, with the settlement originating in 658. This was founded by a Northumbrian nobleman known as Wilfrid, who later became Archbishop of York; he was granted the land by King Alhfrith.

The earliest settlers were stonemasons, glaziers and plasterers that Wilfrid brought over to help construct the Ripon monastery, from Lyon in Francia and Rome which was then under Byzantine rule. The years following the death of Wilfrid are obscure in Ripon&#x27;s history. After the invasion of the Great Heathen Army of Norse Vikings in Northumbria, the Danelaw was established and the Kingdom of Jórvík was founded in the Yorkshire area. In 937, Athelstan, then King of England, granted the privilege of sanctuary to Ripon, for a mile around the church. One of his successors was less well-disposed: after the Northumbrians rebelled against English rule in 948, King Edred had the buildings at Ripon burned. Prosperity was restored by the end of the 10th century, as the body of Saint Cuthbert was moved to Ripon for a while, due to the threat of Danish raids.

===Normans and the Middle Ages===

After the Norman conquest, much of the north rebelled in 1069, even trying to bring back Danish rule; the suppression that followed was the Harrying of the North, which resulted in the death of approximately one-third of the population of the North of England. Ripon is thought to have shrunk to a small community around the church following the suppression. The lands of the church were transferred to St Peter&#x27;s Church at York as the Liberty of Ripon and it was during this time that a grand Collegiate Church was built on top of the ruins of Wilfrid&#x27;s building. Eventually developed in the Gothic style, the project owed much to the work of Roger de Pont L&#x27;Evêque and Walter de Gray, two Archbishops of York during the Plantagenet era. During the 12th century Ripon built up a booming wool trade, attracting Italian trade merchants, especially Florentines, who bought and exported large quantities.

Ripon&#x27;s proximity to Fountains Abbey, where the Cistercians had a long tradition of sheep farming and owned much grazing land, was a considerable advantage. After English people were forbidden from wearing foreign cloth in 1326, Ripon developed a cloth industry which was third in size in Yorkshire after York and Halifax. Due to conflict with Scotland, political emphasis was on the North during the time of Edward I and Edward II, as Scottish invaders attacked numerous northern English towns. Ripon had a wakeman to make sure the residents were safely home by curfew and law and order was maintained; however, it was forced to pay 1,000 marks to the Scots to prevent them from burning down the town on one occasion.

===Reformation and Tudor times===

Ripon, which relied heavily on its religious institutions, was badly affected by the English Reformation under the Tudor king Henry VIII. The Abbot of Fountains, William Thirske, was expelled by Henry and replaced; Thirske went on to become one of the leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace popular rising. The people of Northern England were quite traditional in their beliefs and were unhappy about Henry&#x27;s intention to break with Rome; the Pilgrimage of Grace was the manifestation of this sentiment. The revolt failed and Henry followed through with the break from Rome and the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which included Fountains Abbey.

After Mary, Queen of Scots, fled Scotland to Northern England she stayed at Ripon on her journey. The mainly Catholic North supported her, and there was another popular rising known as the Rising of the North; this began six miles (10 km) away at Topcliffe and was led by Thomas Percy, the 7th Earl of Northumberland and Charles Neville, the 6th Earl of Westmorland. The rebels stayed at Ripon on 18 November 1569, but the rising eventually failed resulting in 600 people being executed, 300 of whom were hanged at Gallows Hill in Ripon during January 1570.

Plans were drawn up to make Ripon a centre of education, a &quot;University of the North&quot;, to rival Oxford and Cambridge. Although chief advisers Lord Burghley and Archbishop Sandys supported the idea, Elizabeth I did not follow it through. The scheme was revived in 1604 by Sandys&#x27; widow Cicely, under the patronage of Anne of Denmark and Bess of Hardwick without success.

===Civil War and Restoration===

Ripon replaced its old textiles industry with one for the manufacture of spurs during the 16th century. They were so widely known that they gave rise to the proverb &quot;as true steel as Ripon Rowels&quot;. At the time, spurs did not just serve as functional riding accessories, they were also fashionable; an expensive pair was made for King James I when he stayed at Ripon in 1617. It was James who granted Ripon a Royal Charter in 1604 and created the first Mayor of Ripon. After the Bishops&#x27; Wars in Scotland, a treaty was signed at Ripon in 1640 to stop the conflict between Charles I and the Scottish Covenanters. Although Ripon was not in the main line of fighting which was to the east, it remained loyal and royalist during the English Civil War. There was an incident in 1643, when parliamentarian forces under Thomas Mauleverer entered Ripon and damaged the Minster, but John Mallory and the royalist forces soon settled the matter after a skirmish in the Market Place. The royalists were eventually defeated in the Civil War and Charles I spent two nights as a prisoner in Ripon. Oliver Cromwell visited the city twice on his way to battle, once on the way to the Preston and also on the way to the Battle of Worcester.

By the time of the English Restoration, several strains of non-conformist Christian practices had appeared, although they were not common in Ripon, the majority of people being Anglicans with a Catholic minority. After the Revolution of 1688, which overthrew James II, there were Jacobite risings in the British Isles; some Riponmen were jailed in February 1746 upon &quot;suspicion of corresponding with Prince Charles Edward Stuart&quot;. The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, preached in Ripon and a small community of followers was established. During the Georgian era Ripon, unlike several other cities, was not significantly affected by the Industrial Revolution despite the existence of various guilds. Although more widely known for his activities outside of Ripon, John Aislabie, during his time as Member of Parliament for Ripon, created the Studley Royal Park with its water garden and erected the Ripon Obelisk (designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor). Newby Hall was also created during this period by Christopher Wren.

===Modern day===
Communications were improved with the opening of Ripon railway station in May 1848. During the First World War, a large military training camp was built in Ripon; the local community offered hospitality not only to soldiers&#x27; wives but to the Flemish refugees who became part of Ripon&#x27;s community. The racecourse south-east of the city also served as an airfield (RFC Ripon) for the Royal Flying Corps (and latterly, the Royal Air Force). The racecourse was also used as a demobilisation centre for troops returning from France well into 1919.

The town had a similar though smaller role during the Second World War and, in recognition of this, the Royal Engineers were presented with the Freedom of the City in 1947. Since the War, Ripon has gone through some remodelling and has grown in size; it attracts thousands of tourists each year who come to see its famous buildings with their long Christian heritage, nearby Studley Park, Ripon Racecourse, and in recent times the theme park Lightwater Valley.


== City status ==
Ripon was the first Church of England diocese to be created after the English Reformation, as it was recognised that existing dioceses were unsuited for the large increases in population caused particularly by the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century in central England. It was deemed that new cathedral building on a national scale was not viable and so Ripon, containing a high status parish church, was created from the existing Chester and York dioceses in 1836, with the building promoted to cathedral status. Ripon council presumed this had elevated the town to the rank of city, and started referring to itself as such. The next diocese Manchester was promoted similarly, but doubts as to its use of the title were raised. With the subsequent clearer understanding of needing to petition the monarch, Manchester did so and obtained the status in 1853. Ripon was encouraged to follow suit, with its own status being recognised by the parliamentary City of Ripon Act in 1865.

In 1974, Ripon borough (see Governance) was abolished and a parish council established as part of wider local government reform. The award of city status is typically granted to a local authority, whose administrative area is then considered to be the formal borders of the city, the grant in this case being removed at the same time and bestowed onto the parish. By this definition, the whole parish council area of Ripon, including its settlement and surrounding rural area containing a tiny portion of the Nidderdale AONB to the north west, is considered to be the limits of the city. It contains the third lowest population of all the cities in England, however it falls to seventh place when taking the whole of the UK into consideration. Using 2011 ONS census statistics, Ripon has the third smallest city council area but the fourth lowest urban area of any city in England.

==Governance==

Ripon became a municipal borough of the West Riding of Yorkshire with its headquarters at Ripon Town Hall in 1835, and remained an independent borough until 1974. That year, following the Local Government Act 1972, the former area of Ripon borough was merged with Harrogate borough and several rural districts of the West Riding to form an enlarged Harrogate borough in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire.

The lowest tier of governance in Ripon is the Ripon City Council, a parish council with twelve members, three for each of four wards. In 2019, four councillors are Conservative, and the rest are independent.

Ripon was represented by the Member of Parliament for Yorkshire until it had its own parliamentary borough established on a permanent basis in 1553. Ripon was able to elect two MPs to represent its parliamentary borough; the right of election was vested not in the population as a whole, but in the (originally meaning freemen of the borough or freeholders) until the Great Reform Act of 1832. The next Reform Act which came into force at the 1868 election, reduced Ripon&#x27;s representation from two MPs to one. Some of the more notable MPs of Ripon were John Aislabie, Frederick John Robinson and George Cockburn. The Reform Act of 1885 abolished the borough of Ripon, but the county constituency in which the town was placed as a result was named Ripon, and this continued as a single member constituency, albeit with some boundary changes, until it was abolished before the 1983 general election. Since 1983, Ripon has been part of the Skipton and Ripon constituency, a Conservative Party stronghold.

==Geography==

===Topography===

Ripon lies at the confluence of two rivers, the Laver and the Skell, which meet in the west of the city. As they flow through the city, the Skell feeds water into the basin of Ripon Canal. East of the city, the Skell meets the River Ure, and both the Ure and canal head south-eastwards towards Boroughbridge. The Ure was the traditional boundary between the old West and North Ridings of Yorkshire.

As the city is at the meeting point of three rivers, it has flooded often in the 20th and 21st centuries; notable floods have occurred in 1982, 1991, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2007. This prompted spending over £14 million on the building of flood defences for the city and a storage area upstream of the city which can hold of water.

Much of the geology of the district is magnesian limestone, part of the Permian rocks which extend southwards from Darlington to Wetherby. The area has pockets of gypsum underlying the surface soils. Water has dissolved the gypsum, leaving the area prone to sinkholes, especially north of the city and on the northern side of the Ure.

==Landmarks and architecture==

The main feature of Ripon is an English Gothic style cathedral, originally founded by Irish monks but refounded by Saint Wilfrid in 672. It has been rebuilt many times, and the only original building is the Saxon crypt. It is home to Wilfrid’s grave.

Ripon Spa Baths is a grade II listed building which was opened in 1905. Originally, spa water was pumped from Aldfield a village to the north of the city, but later, the baths were opened on site too. The site closed in 2021, and in 2024, it was purchased by a private buyer to be converted into a hospitality venue and luxury apartments.

==Education==

Ripon is home to Ripon Grammar School which is a selective intake, state secondary school. The school claims to take roots from the school which was attached to the Collegiate Church, founded during the time of the Angle kingdom of Northumbria by Saint Wilfrid. The refoundation date for the school was during the reign of Queen Mary I in 1555. The school has several notable alumni, known as Old Riponians, including theologian Bishop Beilby Porteus, historian Bishop William Stubbs, fashion designer Bruce Oldfield and television presenter Richard Hammond. In the modern day the school hosts around 800 pupils, gaining engineering status in 2006, it receives favourable reports from the Ofsted, being either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot;. Opposite Ripon Grammar on Clotherholme Road is the non-selective Outwood Academy Ripon (formerly Ripon College, a secondary modern school), which was also known as Ripon City School until 1999. It has around 630 pupils and is exceeding the national average of GCSE results.

On the site of the Old Ripon Racecourse in Whitcliffe Lane was St Olave&#x27;s Preparatory School. This site was taken over by an independent co-ed preparatory school founded in 1960 called the Cathedral Choir School. The choir school closed in 2012 and the site has now had approval for the building of new residential dwellings. Ripon previously had higher education facilities in the form of the College of Ripon and York St John until 2001. This college had its roots in two Anglican teacher training colleges, which were founded in York in 1841 for men and 1846 for women. The women&#x27;s college moved to Ripon in 1862. Over the next century, the colleges gradually diversified their education programmes. The colleges merged in 1974 to form the College of Ripon and York St John. The combined institution became a college of the University of Leeds in 1990. Between 1999 and 2001, all activities were transferred to York and the college received the name York St John University. One of York St John&#x27;s buildings on its Lord Mayor&#x27;s Walk campus was renamed &#x27;Ripon&#x27; in June 2018 to commemorate Ripon Training College&#x27;s &quot;contribution to women&#x27;s education&quot; over 123 years of service.

Evolve, a small, inclusive post-16 college is based in the centre of Ripon, which works alongside Craven College, which is based in Skipton.

On the outskirts of Ripon there is the specialist autism education school called Spring Hill. The school offers day and boarding places. Current pupil numbers are 22. These include 17 boys, 5 girls, and 6 boarders.
Spring Hill is owned by Cambian group PLC which is a large UK provider of specialist provision for children and adults. Spring Hill was previously in the ownership of the charity Barnardos.
The current headteacher is Samantha Campbell, the head of care is Rebecca Sharp, The deputy headteacher is Christine Sherman, the head of education is currently vacant and the transitions and admissions coordinator is currently vacant.

==Religion==

Christianity is the largest religious affiliation in Ripon; 79.3% of the people in the area polled as part of the United Kingdom Census 2001 professed the Christian faith. Ripon Cathedral is the main religious building in the city and contains a tomb said to contain the bones of Saint Wilfrid who founded a monastery here and with it the town. The Venerable William Gibson is another noted local figure, a Catholic martyr who was one of the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales.

The Church of England is in the majority, with two parishes: the ancient Ripon Cathedral and Holy Trinity Church. Ripon was the episcopal see of the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds represented by the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, created in 1836 with just Ripon in its title but adapted to include Leeds in 2000. In 2014 it became part of the Diocese of Leeds, with Ripon Cathedral serving as one of its three cathedrals of equal status. During the time of the kingdom of Northumbria there was a short-lived Diocese of Ripon, with Eadhedus the only bishop. There is also a Medieval chapel located on Magdalens Road, which was once part of a leper hospital. The Chapel of St Mary Magdalen is still used for regular worship and is a grade I listed building.

There is a Roman Catholic parish in Ripon called St Wilfrid&#x27;s; it is covered by the Diocese of Leeds in the Harrogate deanery and the church is an architecturally significant building. There are also around two places of worship for Methodism in Ripon, as well as a couple of evangelical churches including Bethel Church and Zion Baptist Church.
==Culture==

Market day is held on a Thursday, and there are 120 stalls. In celebration of the city&#x27;s founder the &quot;Wilfrid Procession&quot; is held every year; it originated in 1108 when King Henry I granted the privilege of holding a fair for him. At the procession there are various decorated floats which make their way through the city with locals in costume. Part of the tradition represents the return of Wilfrid to Ripon, a decorated dummy (sometimes a man in costume instead) dressed as Wilfrid is sat on a horse, accompanied by two musicians with another man carrying St Wilfrid&#x27;s hat around. Ripon also has dancing traditions such as the Long Sword dance and Morris dance.

The market square is the site of the Ripon Obelisk, erected in 1702 by John Aislabie and designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor. It stands in height and is capped with a weathervane bearing a representation of the wakeman&#x27;s horn. It is Grade I listed and reputed to be the oldest in England.

The tradition of the Ripon Hornblower has endured since 886 and continues on to this day. It originates with the wakeman of Ripon, whose job in the Middle Ages was similar to that of a mayor, although he had more responsibilities in the keeping of law and order. Every day at 9:00 pm the horn is blown at the four corners of the obelisk in Ripon Market. The horn has become the symbol of the city and represents Ripon on the Harrogate borough coat of arms. There are three museums in Ripon collectively known as the &quot;Yorkshire Law and Order Museums&quot;; it includes the Courthouse, the Prison and Police and the Workhouse Museums.

===Sport===
In terms of sport, the most noted field of participation is horse racing with the Ripon Racecourse. The sport has a long history in Ripon, with the first recorded meeting on Bondgate Green in 1664, while its current location has been used as a racetrack since 1900. Ripon staged Britain&#x27;s first race for female riders in 1723. The city is also home to Ripon Rugby Union Football Club who were founded in 1886 and currently play in Yorkshire 2, the eighth tier of the English Rugby Union league.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and BBC North East and Cumbria on BBC One &amp; ITV Yorkshire and ITV Tyne Tees on ITV1. Television signals can be received from either Emley Moor or Bilsdale TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio York, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire (formerly Stray FM), &#x27;Your Harrogate&#x27; (which broadcast from Harrogate) and BFBS (which provides radio programmes for His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces).

The Ripon Gazette is the town’s weekly local newspaper.

===In popular culture===
A character in Downton Abbey refers to becoming a partner in a Ripon firm of solicitors. The historical drama also refers to the nearby towns of Easingwold and Thirsk.

==Transport==
The city was previously served by Ripon railway station on the Leeds-Northallerton Line that ran between Leeds and Northallerton. It was once part of the North Eastern Railway and then London &amp; North Eastern Railway. The Ripon to Harrogate Line was closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts. Today, much of the route of the line through the city is now a relief road and although the former station still stands, it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements wanting to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of a line between Ripon and Harrogate would be economically viable, costing £40 million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700.

By road, Ripon is well connected; it is accessible from the north and south via the A1(M) motorway which connects to Ripon by the B6265. Ripon is accessible from the east and west via the A61 which is the main road running through the city.

Harrogate Bus Company&#x27;s route 36 links the city to Harrogate and Leeds, and there are also regular bus routes to Boroughbridge, York, Thirsk, Northallerton, Leyburn, Richmond and others.

The Ripon Canal was proposed by John Smeaton in 1766, to connect the city centre to part of the River Ure; it was used for the transportation of coal from the Durham coalfields into the city. Although abandoned in 1956, a conservationist campaign saw it partly reopened in 1988, and fully in 1996.

<text>Freeview is the United Kingdom&#x27;s sole digital terrestrial television platform. It is operated by [[Everyone TV]] and DTV Services Ltd, a joint venture between the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky. It was launched on 30 October 2002, taking over the licence from ITV Digital which collapsed that year. The service provides consumer access via an aerial to the seven DTT multiplexes covering the United Kingdom. As of July 2020, it has 85 TV channels, 26 digital radio channels, 10 HD channels, six text services, 11 streamed channels, and one interactive channel.

Delivery of standard-definition television and radio is labelled Freeview, while delivery of HDTV is called Freeview HD. Reception of Freeview requires a DVB-T/DVB-T2 tuner, either in a separate set-top box or built into the TV set. Since 2008, all new TV sets sold in the United Kingdom have a built-in Freeview tuner. Freeview HD requires an HDTV-capable tuner. Digital video recorders (DVRs) with a built-in Freeview tuner are labelled Freeview+. Depending on model, DVRs and HDTV sets with a Freeview tuner may offer standard Freeview or Freeview HD. Freeview Play is a more recent addition which adds direct access to catch-up services via the Internet.

The technical specification for Freeview is published and maintained by the Digital TV Group, the industry association for digital TV in the UK which also provide the test and conformance regime for Freeview, Freeview + and Freeview HD products. DMOL (DTT Multiplex Operators Ltd.), a company owned by the operators of the six DTT multiplexes (BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Arqiva) is responsible for technical platform management and policy, including the electronic programme guide and channel numbering. 

==History==
Freeview officially launched on 30 October 2002 at 5 am, when the BBC and Crown Castle (now Arqiva) officially took over the digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences to broadcast on the three multiplexes from the defunct ITV Digital. The founding members of DTV Services, who trade as Freeview, were the BBC, Crown Castle UK and British Sky Broadcasting. On 11 October 2006, ITV plc and Channel 4 became equal shareholders. Since then, the Freeview model has been copied in Australia and New Zealand.

Although all pay channels had been closed down on ITV Digital, many free-to-air channels continued broadcasting, including the five analogue channels and digital channels such as ITV2, ITN News Channel, S4C2, TV Travel Shop and QVC. With the launch of Freeview other channels were broadcast free-to-air, such as: Sky Travel, UK History, Sky News, Sky Sports News, The Hits (later renamed 4Music in 2008, now defunct) and TMF (later renamed to Viva in 2009, now defunct) were available from the start. BBC Four and the interactive BBC streams were moved to multiplex B. Under the initial plans, the two multiplexes operated by Crown Castle would carry eight channels altogether. The seventh stream became shared by UK Bright Ideas and Ftn which launched in February 2003. The eighth stream was left unused until April 2004 when the shopping channel Ideal World launched on Freeview. There are now 14 streams carried by two multiplexes, with Multiplex C carrying 6 streams, and Multiplex D carrying 8. It has recently been announced that more streams are now available on the multiplexes, and that bidding is under way.

===2009 retune===
The Freeview service underwent a major upgrade on 30 September 2009, which required 18 million households to retune their Freeview receiving equipment. The changes, meant to ensure proper reception of Channel 5, led to several thousand complaints from people who lost channels (notably ITV3 and ITV4) as a result of retuning their equipment. The Freeview website crashed and the call centre was inundated as a result of the problems. The change involved an update to the NIT (Network Information Table), which some receivers could not accommodate. Many thousands of people could not receive some channels. This included 460,000 fed from relay stations who lost access to ITV3 and ITV4. Updates were broadcast to enable firmware changes, but in some cases the receiver must be left on and receiving broadcasts to accept the updates; not everyone was aware of this.

===2014 retune===
The Freeview service underwent a major upgrade on 3 September 2014 which required 18 million households to retune their Freeview receiving equipment. The changes included a reshuffle of the Children&#x27;s, News, and Interactive genres.

A number of new HD channels launched in 2014, from a new group of multiplexes awarded to Arqiva. The new HD channels were launched in selected areas on 10 December 2013 with a further roll-out during 2014.

=== Temporary multiplex removal ===
The temporary multiplexes are Arqiva-owned multiplexes called COM7 and COM8, DVB-T2 multiplexes for Freeview HD capable devices carrying some channels including HD channels. COM7 is made up of mostly +1s and HDs such as More4+1 and BBC News HD. COM8 consisted of +1s, HDs and other channels such as NOW 80s, PBS America+1 and BBC Four HD. Over the decade these multiplexes are being shut off with COM8 closing on 6 June 2020, with many +1 and HD channels like 5Star+1 and 4seven HD closing and others (like Now 80s) moving to COM7.

=== Technical problems ===
On 10 August 2021, the 315-metre (1033&#x27;) Bilsdale transmitter caught fire leaving up to a million homes in the North East of England without a TV or radio signal.
Work is ongoing to restore services, but delays to the granting of planning permission for an 80-metre (300&#x27;) temporary mast sited at Bilsdale, and the lack of safe access to the site, have left up to half a million homes without a service as of 8 September 2021.

On the evening of 25 September 2021, transmissions of Freeview channels operated by the BBC, Channel 4 and ViacomCBS (Channel 5) were impacted by the activation of a fire suppressant system at the premises of Red Bee Media. While the BBC moved its playout from White City to Salford and Channel 5 went into &#x27;recovery mode&#x27; (with viewers seeing an additional black &amp; white symbol at the top of the screen), Channel 4&#x27;s channels went off air for a number of hours with E4+1 and 4Music still off air on Monday 27 September (though 4Music&#x27;s channel 30 slot was relaying the output of The Box, with its back-to-back music video format, on that date).

==Channels==
The Freeview service broadcasts free-to-air television channels, radio stations and interactive services from the existing public service broadcasters. Channels on the service include the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 terrestrial channels, as well as their digital services. In addition, channels from other commercial operators, such as Sky and UKTV, are available, as well as radio services from a number of broadcasters.

The full range of channels broadcast via digital terrestrial television includes some pay television services such as BoxNation and Racing UK. These channels, although available only to subscribers with appropriate equipment, are listed in the on-screen electronic programme guides displayed by many Freeview receivers but cannot be viewed.

The link above gives a full up-to-date list of channels, but, as of January 2020, excluding channels such as S4C or the many Local TV services (1 service included in the count) they total 105 Freeview, 17 Freeview HD and 33 radio.

==Reception equipment==

===Receivers===

To receive Freeview, either a television with an integrated digital tuner or an older analogue television with a suitable Freeview-branded set-top box is required.

===Aerial===

An aerial is required for viewing any broadcast television transmissions. For all transmissions indoor, loft-mounted, and external aerials are available. In regions of strong signal an indoor aerial may be adequate; in marginal areas a high-gain external aerial mounted high above the ground with an electronic amplifier at its top may be needed.

Aerial requirements for analogue (the old standard) and digital reception in the UK are identical; there is no such thing as a special &quot;digital aerial&quot;, although installers and suppliers often falsely say one is necessary. As the signal degrades, the analogue picture degrades gradually, but the digital picture holds up well then suddenly becomes unwatchable; an aerial which gave poor analogue viewing may give unwatchable, rather than poor, digital viewing, and need replacing, at a cost of typically £80 to £180, most of which is fitting cost. An aerial intended for external use may be fitted indoors if there is space and the signal is strong enough.

==Services==
The Digital TV Group, the industry association for digital television in the UK, is responsible for co-ordination between Freeview and other digital services.

The original Freeview was later expanded with additional facilities (Freeview+), high-definition channels (Freeview HD), and Internet connectivity (Freeview Play). All services remain available; the original Freeview equipment will work (unenhanced) in the same way it always did.

===Freeview===
The original Freeview service allowed a large number of digital television channels to be received on a compatible television receiver, set-top box, or personal video recorder. An electronic programme guide was available. Freeview channels are not encrypted and can be received by anyone in the UK. There is no additional charge to receive Freeview but it is a legal obligation to hold a current television licence to watch or record TV as it is being broadcast.

A subscription-based DTT service, Top Up TV, launched in March 2004. The Top Up TV service was not connected with the Freeview service, but ran alongside it on the DTT platform and was included in the Freeview EPG; programmes could be received on some Freeview set-top boxes and televisions equipped with a card slot or CI slot. The service also worked with existing ex-ONdigital / ITV Digital boxes that received the Freeview package; subscribers with those boxes had to insert their TopUp TV card into the slot which was originally used for inserting ONdigital / ITV Digital smartcards. Top Up TV was replaced in 2006, by a service that did not run on Freeview equipment. In October 2013, the TopUp TV service was closed down.

The Freeview logo certification for standard definition (SD) receivers and recorders was withdrawn in January 2017.

===Freeview HD===
Freeview HD comprises a number of high-definition versions of existing channels. It requires a different high-definition tuner, and does not supersede or replace standard Freeview. 

On 20 August 2020, Freeview announced that it would phase out their Freeview HD brand in 2022.

====Channels====
With two channels (BBC HD and ITV HD) Freeview HD completed a &quot;technical launch&quot; on 2 December 2009 from Winter Hill (as a full power service) and Crystal Palace (as a reduced power temporary service). It operates on multiplex BBC B (aka Multiplex B or PSB3). The service was broadcast to all regions by the end of 2012. Channel 4 HD commenced test broadcasts on 25 March 2010 with an animated caption, ahead of its full launch on 30 March 2010, coinciding with the commercial launch of Freeview HD. S4C Clirlun launched on 30 April 2010, in Wales, where Channel 4 HD did not broadcast. STV HD launched in Scotland, where ITV HD does not broadcast, on 6 June 2010. S4C Clirlun closed on 1 December 2012, allowing Channel 4 HD to begin broadcasting in Wales.

Five HD was due to launch during 2010 but was unable to reach &#x27;key criteria&#x27; to keep its slot. Spare allocation on multiplex B was handed over to the BBC, two years from the date when it was anticipated that further capacity on multiplex B would revert to the control of the BBC Trust. On 3 November 2010, BBC One HD launched on Freeview HD. Initially it was available in addition to the existing BBC HD channel, which continued to show the &quot;best of the rest&quot; of the BBC in HD. However, BBC HD was replaced by BBC Two HD on 26 March 2013.

Until 17 October 2011, the commercial public service broadcasters had the opportunity to apply to Ofcom to provide an additional HD service from between 28 November 2011 and 1 April 2012. Channel 5 HD was the sole applicant, with the aim of launching in spring or early summer 2012. On 15 December 2011, Channel 5 dropped its bid to take the fifth slot after being unable to resolve &quot;issues of commercial importance&quot;. Subject to any future Ofcom decision to re-advertise the slot, the capacity will remain with the BBC and can be used by it for BBC services or services provided by a third party via a commercial arrangement. The BBC temporarily used the space to broadcast a high definition simulcast of their main Freeview red button feed for the duration of the 2012 Summer Olympics, followed by a channel from Channel 4 for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. On 13 June 2013, the BBC temporarily launched a high-definition red button stream in the vacant space.

On 16 July 2013, Ofcom announced that up to 10 new HD channels would be launched by early 2014, using new capacity made available by the digital switchover. This provided additional spectrum in the 600Mhz band for additional DVB-T2 multiplexes, reaching up to 70% of the UK population. At the same time, the BBC announced that they would provide five new HD channels due to the newly available capacity: BBC Three HD, BBC Four HD, CBBC HD, CBeebies HD and BBC News HD. BBC Three HD and CBBC HD launched to all viewers on 10 December 2013 using the capacity released by the Red Button HD service, and the other BBC channels launched in some regions, expanding to 70% UK coverage by June 2014.

Channel 5 HD launched on Freeview on 4 May 2016.

In June 2022, it was announced that the COM7 multiplex would be closing due to the license expiring and the frequency used being released for 5G. The BBC announced that they have made provisions for a 6th slot for BBC Four HD and CBeebies HD to move into available capacity that has been newly identified on the PSB3 multiplex which the BBC operates. However, BBC News HD would stop being broadcast on Freeview.

====Technical====
The Digital TV Group publishes and maintains the UK technical specification for high-definition services on digital terrestrial television (Freeview) based on the new DVB-T2 standard. The specification is known as the D-book. Freeview HD is the first operational TV service in the world using the DVB-T2 standard. This standard is incompatible with DVB-T, and can only be received using compatible reception equipment. Some television receivers sold before the HD launch claimed to be &quot;HD-ready&quot;, but this usually implies that the screen can display HD, rather than that DVB-T2 signals can be received a suitable tuner (typically built into a STB or PVR) is additionally required. Freeview HD set-top boxes and televisions are available. To qualify for the Freeview HD logo, receivers will need to be IPTV-capable and display Freeview branding, including the logo, on the electronic programme guide screen. The Freeview HD trademark requirements state that any manufacturer applying for the Freeview HD logo should submit their product to the Digital TV Group&#x27;s test centre (DTG Testing) for conformance testing.

On 2 February 2010, Vestel became the first manufacturer to gain Freeview HD certification, for the Vestel T8300 set top box. Humax released the first Freeview HD reception equipment, the Humax HD-FOX T2, on 13 February 2010.

It was announced on 10 February 2009, that the signal would be encoded with MPEG-4 AVC High Profile Level 4, which supports up to 1080i30/1080p30, so 1080p50 cannot be used. The system has been designed from the start to allow regional variations in the broadcast schedule. Services are statistically multiplexed bandwidth is dynamically allocated between channels, depending on the complexity of the images with the aim of maintaining a consistent quality, rather than a specific bit rate. Video for each channel can range between 3 Mbit/s and 17 Mbit/s. AAC or Dolby Digital Plus audio is transmitted at 384 kb/s for 5.1 surround sound, with stereo audio at 128–192 kbit/s; audio description takes up 64 kbit/s, subtitles 200 kbit/s and the data stream, for interactive applications 50 kbit/s. Recording sizes for Freeview HD television transmissions average around 3 GB per hour. Between 22 and 23 March 2011, an encoder software change allowed the Freeview version of BBC HD to automatically detect progressive material and change encoding mode appropriately, meaning the channel can switch to 1080p25. This was extended to all of the other Freeview HD channels in October 2011.

To ensure provision of audio description, broadcasters typically use the AAC codec. Hardware restrictions allow only a single type of audio decoder to operate at any one time, so the main audio and the audio description must use the same encoding family for them to be successfully combined at the receiver. In the case of BBC HD, the main audio is coded as AAC-LC and only the audio description is encoded as HE-AAC. Neither AAC nor Dolby Digital Plus codecs are supported by most home AV equipment, which typically accept Dolby Digital or DTS, leaving owners with stereo, rather than surround sound, output. Transcoding from AAC to Dolby Digital or DTS and multi-channel output via HDMI was not originally necessary for Freeview HD certification. As of June 2010 the DTG D-Book includes the requirement for mandatory transcoding when sending audio via S/PDIF, and for either transcoding or multi-channel PCM audio when sending it via HDMI in order for manufacturers to gain Freeview HD certification from April 2011. Thus equipment sold as Freeview HD before April 2011 may not deliver surround sound to audio equipment (some equipment may, but this is not mandatory); later equipment must be capable of surround sound compatible with most suitable audio equipment.

In early February 2011, it was announced that one million Freeview HD set-top boxes had been sold.

====Copy protection====
In August 2009, the BBC wrote to Ofcom after third-party content owners asked the BBC to undertake measures to ensure that all Freeview HD boxes would include copy protection systems as required by the Digital TV Group&#x27;s D-Book, which sets technical standards for digital terrestrial television in the UK. The BBC proposed to ensure compliance with copy-protection standards on the upgraded Freeview HD multiplex by compressing the service information (SI) data, which receivers need to understand the TV services in the data stream. To encourage boxes to adopt copy protection, the BBC made its own look-up tables and decompression algorithm, necessary for decoding the EPG data on high-definition channels, available without charge only to manufacturers who implement the copy-protection technology. This technology would control the way HD films and TV shows are copied onto, for example Blu-ray discs, and shared with others over the internet. No restrictions will be placed on standard-definition services. In a formal written response, Ofcom principal advisor Greg Bensberg said that wording of the licence would probably need to be changed to reflect the fact that this new arrangement is permitted. The BBC had suggested that as an alternative to the SI compression scheme, the Freeview HD multiplex may have to adopt encryption. Bensberg said that it would appear &quot;inappropriate to encrypt public service broadcast content on DTT&quot;.

On 14 June 2010, Ofcom agreed to allow the BBC to limit the full availability of its own and other broadcasters&#x27; high definition (HD) Freeview services to receivers that control how HD content can be used. Ofcom concluded that the decision to accept the BBC&#x27;s request will deliver net benefits to licence-holders by ensuring they have access to the widest possible range of HD television content on DTT.

===Freeview HD Recorder===
Freeview HD Recorder (formerly Freeview+, originally named Freeview Playback) is the marketing name for Freeview-capable digital video recorders with some enhancements over the original Freeview.

All recorders are required to include the following features in addition to standard Freeview:
* At least eight-day electronic programme guide (EPG)
* Series link (one timer to record whole series)
* Record split programmes as one programme
* Offer to record related programme
* Record alternative showing if there is a time conflict
* Schedule changes updated in standby (e.g. scheduled recording starting early)
* Accurate Recording (AR, equivalent to PDC) – programmes are recorded based on signals from the broadcaster rather than scheduled time. (Since this is based on signals from the broadcaster, the broadcaster can prevent recording by sending nonsense signals as a form of copy protection, as already happens on music channels. However, this can be circumvented by specifying a timer recording instead of a programme recording or by connecting the receiver to a traditional videocassette recorder.)

Pace plc introduced the first DTT DVR in the UK in September 2002, called the Pace Twin. However this was before the Freeview brand and its Playback and + marketing names were introduced.

===Freeview Play===
Freeview Play combines the existing live television service with catch-up TV (BBC iPlayer, ITVX, STV Player, Channel 4, S4C Clic, My5, U, Pop Player, CBS Catchup Channels UK, Legend) on a variety of compatible TV and set-top boxes via the user&#x27;s standard broadband Internet connection. Its main purpose is to provide easy access to catch-up services by scrolling backwards on the traditional electronic programming guide (EPG); YouView is a similar but competing combination of live Freeview and catch-up using the EPG.

The technology is an open standard, but with prominent Freeview Play branding. The service launched in October 2015, on compliant equipment, initially 2015 Panasonic TV receivers and Humax set-top boxes, including existing models with a software update. Other manufacturers were announcing new models &quot;later this year [i.e. 2015]&quot;. The 2017 specification for Freeview Play includes support for HDR video using hybrid log–gamma (HLG), when playing on-demand broadband content.

===Mobile app ===
In 2019, Freeview released an app for iOS and Android devices. The app provides a centralised TV guide for 23 channels and the ability to watch them through BBC iPlayer, ITVX, STV Player, Channel 4, My5 and UKTV Play.

<text>Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ṭūsiyy al-Ghazali (), known commonly as Al-Ghazali (; , ; – 19 December 1111), known in medieval Europe by the Latinized Algazel or Algazelus, was a Persian Shafi&#x27;i Sunni Muslim scholar and polymath. He is known as one of the most prominent and influential jurisconsults, legal theoreticians, muftis, philosophers, theologians, logicians and mystics in Islamic history.

He is considered to be the 11th century&#x27;s &quot;mujaddid&quot;, a renewer of the faith, who, according to the prophetic hadith, appears once every 100 years to restore the faith of the Islamic community. Al-Ghazali&#x27;s works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that he was awarded the honorific title &quot;Proof of Islam&quot; (&quot;Ḥujjat al-Islām&quot;). Al-Ghazali was a prominent mujtahid in the Shafi&#x27;i school of law.

Much of Al-Ghazali&#x27;s work stemmed around his spiritual crises following his appointment as the head of the Nizamiyya University in Baghdad - which was the most prestigious academic position in the Muslim world at the time. This led to his eventual disappearance from the Muslim world for over 10 years, realising he chose the path of status and ego over God. It was during this period where many of his great works were written. He believed that the Islamic spiritual tradition had become moribund and that the spiritual sciences taught by the first generation of Muslims had been forgotten. This belief led him to write his magnum opus entitled &quot;Iḥyā’ ‘ulūm ad-dīn&quot; (&quot;The Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;). Among his other works, the &quot;Tahāfut al-Falāsifa&quot; (&quot;Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;) is a landmark in the history of philosophy, as it advances the critique of Aristotelian science developed later in 14th-century Europe.

== Biography ==
Al-Ghazali was born in in Tus. He was a Muslim scholar, law specialist, rationalist, and spiritualist of Persian descent. He was born in Tabaran, a town in the district of Tus, Khorasan, not long after Seljuks entered Baghdad and ended Shia Buyid Amir al-umaras. This marked the start of Seljuk influence over Caliphate. While the Seljuk dynasty&#x27;s influence grew, Abu Suleiman Dawud Chaghri Beg married his daughter, Arslan Khatun Khadija to caliph al-Qa&#x27;im in 1056.

A posthumous tradition, the authenticity of which has been questioned in recent scholarship, is that his father died in poverty and left the young al-Ghazali and his brother Ahmad to the care of a Sufi. Al-Ghazali&#x27;s contemporary and first biographer, &#x27;Abd al-Ghafir al-Farisi, records merely that al-Ghazali began to receive instruction in &quot;fiqh&quot; (Islamic jurisprudence) from Ahmad al-Radhakani, a local teacher and Abu ali Farmadi, a Naqshbandi sufi from Tus. He later studied under al-Juwayni, the distinguished jurist and theologian and &quot;the most outstanding Muslim scholar of his time,&quot; in Nishapur, perhaps after a period of study in Gurgan. After al-Juwayni&#x27;s death in 1085, al-Ghazali departed from Nishapur and joined the court of Nizam al-Mulk, the powerful vizier of the Seljuk empire, which was likely centered in Isfahan. After bestowing upon him the titles of &quot;Brilliance of the Religion&quot; and &quot;Eminence among the Religious Leaders&quot;, Nizam al-Mulk advanced al-Ghazali in July 1091 to the &quot;most prestigious and most challenging&quot; professorial position at the time: the Nizamiyya madrasa in Baghdad.

He underwent a spiritual crisis in 1095, which some speculate was brought on by clinical hysteria, abandoned his career and left Baghdad on the pretext of going on pilgrimage to Mecca. Making arrangements for his family, he disposed of his wealth and adopted an ascetic lifestyle. According to biographer Duncan B. Macdonald, the purpose of abstaining from scholastic work was to confront the spiritual experience and more ordinary understanding of &quot;the Word and the Traditions.&quot; After some time in Damascus and Jerusalem, with a visit to Medina and Mecca in 1096, he returned to Tus to spend the next several years in &quot;uzla&quot; (seclusion). The seclusion consisted in abstaining from teaching at state-sponsored institutions, but he continued to publish, receive visitors and teach in the zawiya (private madrasa) and khanqah (Sufi lodge) that he had built.

Fakhr al-Mulk, grand vizier to Ahmad Sanjar, pressed al-Ghazali to return to the Nizamiyya in Nishapur. Al-Ghazali reluctantly capitulated in 1106, fearing rightly that he and his teachings would meet with resistance and controversy. He later returned to Tus and declined an invitation in 1110 from the grand vizier of the Seljuq Sultan Muhammad I to return to Baghdad. He died on 19 December 1111. According to &#x27;Abd al-Ghafir al-Farisi, he had several daughters but no sons.

== School affiliations ==

Al-Ghazali contributed significantly to the development of a systematic view of Sufism and its integration and acceptance in mainstream Islam. As a scholar of Islam, he belonged to the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic jurisprudence and to the Asharite school of theology. Al-Ghazali received many titles such as &quot;Zayn al-Dīn&quot; () and &quot;Ḥujjat al-Islām&quot; ().

He is viewed as the key member of the influential Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy and the most important refuter of the Mutazilites. However, he chose a slightly different position in comparison with the Asharites. His beliefs and thoughts differ in some aspects from the orthodox Asharite school. Furthermore, Salafis claim that Al-Ghazali repented from the Ash&#x27;ari creed and adopted the Athari creed shortly before his death.

== Works ==
A total of about 70 works can be attributed to al-Ghazali. He is also known to have written a fatwa against the Taifa kings of al-Andalus, declaring them to be unprincipled, not fit to rule and that they should be removed from power. This fatwa was used by Yusuf ibn Tashfin to justify his conquest of al-Andalus.

=== &quot;Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot; ===
Al-Ghazali&#x27;s 11th-century book titled &quot;Tahāfut al-Falāsifa&quot; (&quot;Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;)
marked a major turn in Islamic epistemology. The encounter with skepticism led al-Ghazali to investigate a form of theological occasionalism, or the belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present will of God.

In the next century, Ibn Rushd (or Averroes) drafted a lengthy rebuttal of al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;Incoherence&quot; entitled &quot;The Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;; however, the epistemological course of Islamic thought had already been set. Al-Ghazali gave as an example of the illusion of independent laws of cause the fact that cotton burns when coming into contact with fire. While it might seem as though a natural law was at work, it happened each and every time only because God willed it to happen—the event was &quot;a direct product of divine intervention as any more attention grabbing miracle&quot;. Averroes, by contrast insisted while God created the natural law, humans &quot;could more usefully say that fire caused cotton to burn—because creation had a pattern that they could discern.&quot;

The &quot;Incoherence&quot; also marked a turning point in Islamic philosophy in its vehement rejections of Aristotle and Plato. The book took aim at the &quot;Falāsifa&quot;, a loosely defined group of Islamic philosophers from the 8th through the 11th centuries (most notable among them Avicenna and al-Farabi) who drew intellectually upon the Ancient Greeks.

The influence of Al-Ghazali&#x27;s book is still debated. Professor of Arabic and Islamic Science George Saliba in 2007 argued that the decline of science in the 11th century has been overstated, pointing to continuing advances, particularly in astronomy, as late as the 14th century.

Professor of Mathematics Nuh Aydin wrote in 2012 that one the most important reasons of the decline of science in the Islamic world has been Al-Ghazali&#x27;s attack of &quot;philosophers&quot; (scientists, physicists, mathematicians, logicians). The attack peaked in his book &quot;Incoherence&quot;, whose central idea of theological occasionalism implies that &quot;philosophers&quot; cannot give rational explanations to either metaphysical or physical questions. The idea caught on and nullified the critical thinking in the Islamic world.

On the other hand, author and journalist Hassan Hassan in 2012 argued that while indeed scientific thought in Islam was stifled in the 11th century, the person mostly to blame is not al-Ghazali but Nizam al-Mulk.

=== &quot;The Revival of Religious Sciences (Ihya&#x27; Ulum al-Din)&quot; ===
Another of al-Ghazali&#x27;s major works is &quot;Ihya&#x27; Ulum al-Din&quot; or &quot;Ihya&#x27;u Ulumiddin&quot; (&quot;The Revival of Religious Sciences&quot;). It covers almost all fields of Islamic sciences: fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), kalam (theology) and sufism.

It contains four major sections: &quot;Acts of worship&quot; (), &quot;Norms of Daily Life&quot; (), &quot;The ways to Perdition&quot; () and &quot;The Ways to Salvation&quot; (). The became the most frequently recited Islamic text after the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith. Its great achievement was to bring orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together in a useful, comprehensive guide to every aspect of Muslim life and death. The book was well received by Islamic scholars such as Nawawi who stated that: &quot;Were the books of Islam all to be lost, excepting only the Ihya&#x27;, it would suffice to replace them all.&quot; This reception, however, was not universal as the book was burned in Almoravid Spain in 1109 and 1143 as al-Ghazali criticised the fuqaha for meddling in politics and due to al-Ghazali&#x27;s syncretism and support of Sufism. Allegedly, al-Ghazali foretold outraged upon hearing of the burning of his book the rise of the Almohad dynasty and invested is founder Ibn Tumart with the duty to overthrow the Almoravid rule.

=== &quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot; ===

&quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot; is a rewritten version of &quot;The Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;. After the existential crisis that caused him to completely re-examine his way of living and his approach to religion, al-Ghazali put together &quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot;.

=== &quot;Disciplining the Soul&quot; ===
One of the key sections of Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot; is &quot;Disciplining the Soul&quot;, which focuses on the internal struggles that every Muslim will face over the course of his lifetime. The first chapter primarily focuses on how one can develop himself into a person with positive attributes and good personal characteristics . The second chapter has a more specific focus: sexual satisfaction and gluttony. Here, Ghazali states that indeed every man has these desires and needs, and that it is natural to want these things. However, the Prophet explicitly states that there must be a middle ground for man, in order to practice the tenets of Islam faithfully. The ultimate goal that Ghazali is presenting not only in these two chapters, but in the entirety of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;, is that there must be moderation in every aspect of the soul of a man, an equilibrium. These two chapters were the 22nd and 23rd chapters, respectively, in Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;.

=== &quot;The Eternity of the World&quot; ===
Al-Ghazali crafted his rebuttal of the Aristotelian viewpoint on the creation of the world in &quot;The Eternity of the World&quot;. Al-Ghazali essentially formulates two main arguments for what he views as a sacrilegious thought process. Central to the Aristotelian approach is the concept that motion will always precede motion, or in other words, a force will always create another force, and therefore for a force to be created, another force must act upon that force. This means that in essence time stretches infinitely both into the future and into the past, which therefore proves that God did not create the universe at one specific point in time. Al-Ghazali counters this by first stating that if the world was created with exact boundaries, then in its current form there would be no need for a time before the creation of the world by God.

=== &quot;The Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief&quot; ===
Al-Ghazali lays out in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief&quot; his approach to Muslim orthodoxy. Ghazali veers from the often hardline stance of many of his contemporaries during this time period and states that as long as one believes in the Prophet Muhammad and God himself, there are many different ways to practice Islam and that any of the many traditions practiced in good faith by believers should not be viewed as heretical by other Muslims. While Ghazali does state that any Muslim practicing Islam in good faith is not guilty of apostasy, he does outline in &quot;The Criterion&quot; that there is one standard of Islam that is more correct than the others, and that those practicing the faith incorrectly should be moved to change. In Ghazali&#x27;s view, only the Prophet himself could deem a faithfully practicing Muslim an infidel, and his work was a reaction to the religious persecution and strife that occurred often during this time period between various Islamic sects.

=== Deliverance from Error ===
The autobiography al-Ghazali wrote towards the end of his life, &quot;&quot; ( &quot;al-Munqidh min al-Dalal&quot;), is considered a work of major importance. In it, al-Ghazali recounts how, once a crisis of epistemological skepticism had been resolved by &quot;a light which God Most High cast into my breast ... the key to most knowledge,&quot; he studied and mastered the arguments of kalam, Islamic philosophy, and Ismailism. Though appreciating what was valid in the first two of these, at least, he determined that all three approaches were inadequate and found ultimate value only in the mystical experience and insight he attained as a result of following Sufi practices. William James, in &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;, considered the autobiography an important document for &quot;the purely literary student who would like to become acquainted with the inwardness of religions other than the Christian&quot; because of the scarcity of recorded personal religious confessions and autobiographical literature from this period outside the Christian tradition.

=== Works in Persian ===
Al-Ghazali wrote most of his works in Persian and in Arabic. His most important Persian work is &quot;Kimiya-yi sa&#x27;adat&quot; (The Alchemy of Happiness). It is al-Ghazali&#x27;s own Persian version of &quot;Ihya&#x27; &#x27;ulum al-din&quot; (The Revival of Religious Sciences) in Arabic, but a shorter work. It is one of the outstanding works of 11th-century-Persian literature. The book was published several times in Tehran by the edition of Hussain Khadev-jam, a renowned Iranian scholar. It is translated to English, Arabic, Turkish, Urdu, Azerbaijani and other languages.

Another authentic work of al-Ghazali is the so-called &quot;first part&quot; of the Nasihat al-muluk (Counsel for kings), addressed to the Saljuqid ruler of Khurasan Ahmad b. Malik-shah Sanjar (r. 490-552/1097-1157). The text was written after an official reception at his court in 503/1109 and upon his request. Al-Ghazali was summoned to Sanjar because of the intrigues of his opponents and their criticism of his student&#x27;s compilation in Arabic, al-Mankhul min taʿliqat al-usul (The sifted notes on the fundamentals), in addition to his refusal to continue teaching at the Nizamiya of Nishapur. After the reception, al-Ghazali had, apparently, a private audience with Sanjar, during which he quoted a verse from the Quran 14:24: &quot;Have you not seen how Allah sets forth a parable of a beautiful phrase (being) like a beautiful tree, whose roots are firm and whose branches are in Heaven.&quot; The genuine text of the Nasihat al-muluk, which is actually an official epistle with a short explanatory note on al-Manḵul added on its frontispiece.

The majority of other Persian texts, ascribed to him with the use of his fame and authority, especially in the genre of Mirrors for Princes, are either deliberate forgeries fabricated with different purposes or compilations falsely attributed to him. The most famous among them is Ay farzand (O Child!). This is undoubtedly a literary forgery fabricated in Persian one or two generations after al-Ghazali&#x27;s death. The sources used for the forgery consist of two genuine letters by al-Ghazali&#x27;s (number 4, in part, and number 33, totally); both appear in the &quot;Fazaʾil al-anam&quot;. Another source is a letter known as &quot;ʿAyniya&quot; and written by Muhammad&#x27;s younger brother Majd al-Din Ahmad al-Ghazali (d. 520/1126) to his famous disciple ʿAyn al-Quzat Hamadani (492-526/1098-1131); the letter was published in the &quot;Majmuʿa-yi athar-i farsi-yi Ahmad-i Ghazali&quot; (Collection of the Persian writings of Ahmad Ghazali). The other is ʿAyn al-Quzat&#x27;s own letter, published in the &quot;Namaha-yi ʿAyn al-Quzat Hamadani&quot; (Letters by ʿAyn al-Quzat Hamadani). Later, &quot;Ay farzand&quot; was translated into Arabic and became famous as &quot;Ayyuha al-walad&quot;, the Arabic equivalent of the Persian title. The earliest manuscripts with the Arabic translation date from the second half of the 16th and most of the others from the 17th century. The earliest known secondary translation from Arabic into Ottoman Turkish was done in 983/1575. In modern times, the text was translated from Arabic into many European languages and published innumerable times in Turkey as Eyyühe&#x27;l-Veled or Ey Oğul.

A less famous Pand-nama (Book of counsel) also written in the genre of advice literature is a very late compilatory letter of an unknown author formally addressed to some ruler and falsely attributed to al-Ghazali, obviously because it consists of many fragments borrowed mostly from various parts of the Kimiya-yi saʿadat.

== Influence ==
During his life, Al-Ghazali wrote over 70 books on science, Islamic reasoning and Sufism. Al-Ghazali played a major role in integrating Sufism with Shariah. He was also the first to present a formal description of Sufism in his works. His works also strengthened the status of Sunni Islam against other schools. The Batinite (Ismailism) had emerged in Persian territories and were gaining more and more power during al-Ghazali&#x27;s period, as Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated by the members of Ismailis. In his &quot;Fada&#x27;ih al-Batiniyya&quot; (&quot;The Infamies of the Esotericists&quot;) al-Ghazali declared them unbelievers whose blood may be spilled. Al-Ghazali succeeded in gaining widespread acceptance for Sufism at the expense of philosophy. At the same time, in his refutation of philosophers he made use of their philosophical categories and thus helped to give them wider circulation.

The staple of his religious philosophy was arguing that the creator was the center point of all human life that played a direct role in all world affairs. Al-Ghazali&#x27;s influence was not limited to Islam, but in fact his works were widely circulated among Christian and Hebrew scholars and philosophers. Some of the more notable philosophers and scholars in the west include David Hume, Dante, and St. Thomas Aquinas. Moses Ben Maimon, a Jewish theologian was deeply interested and vested in the works of al-Ghazali. One of the more notable achievements of Ghazali was his writing and reform of education that laid out the path of Islamic Education from the 12th to the 19th centuries. Al-Ghazali&#x27;s works were heavily relied upon by Islamic mathematicians and astronomers such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.

Al-Ghazali was by every indication of his writings a true mystic in the Persian sense. He believed himself to be more mystical or religious than he was philosophical; however, he is more widely regarded by some scholars as a leading figure of Islamic philosophy and thought. He describes his philosophical approach as a seeker of true knowledge, a deeper understanding of the philosophical and scientific, and a better understanding of mysticism and cognition. The period following Ghazali &quot;has tentatively been called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy&quot; initiated by Ghazali&#x27;s successful integration of logic into the Islamic seminary Madrasah curriculum.

Imam Al Ghazali mainly chose to keep his legacy in his books so he wrote more than 70 books in his career. It is said about his book &quot;Ihya Ulum Uddin: The Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot; that, if one has no Shaykh Then he has Ihya. Through his writing he still influences islamic scholars and community. Prominent scholars like Shaykh Hamza Yusuf, Shaykh Ibrahim Osi Efa, Dr. Abdul Hakim Murad (Timothy Winter) are greatly influenced by his teaching. People refer to him as the &quot;Proof of Islam&quot;.

== Number of works ==
Al-Ghazali mentioned the number of his works &quot;more than 70&quot; in one of his letters to Sultan Sanjar in the late years of his life. Some &quot;five dozen&quot; are plausibly identifiable, and several hundred attributed works, many of them duplicates because of varying titles, are doubtful or spurious.

The tradition of falsely attributing works to al-Ghazali increased in the 13th century, after the dissemination of the large corpus of works by Ibn Arabi.

Bibliographies have been published by William Montgomery Watt (&quot;The Works Attributed to Al-Ghazali&quot;), Maurice Bouyges (&quot;Essai de chronologie des oeuvres d&#x27;Al-Ghazali&quot;) and others.

== Economic philosophy ==

Al-Ghazali&#x27;s economic philosophy was primarily influenced by his Islamic beliefs. He argued that the importance of economic activity lay both in its benefit to society, as well being necessary for salvation.

He established three goals of economic activity that he believed were part of one&#x27;s religious obligation: &quot;achievement of self-sufficiency for one&#x27;s survival; provision for the well-being of one&#x27;s progeny; and provision for assisting those in economic need.&quot; He argued that subsistence living, or living in a way that provides the basic necessities for only one&#x27;s family, would not be an acceptable practice to be held by the general population because of the detrimental results that he believed that would bring upon the economy, but he acknowledged that some people may choose to live the subsistence lifestyle at their own will for the sake of their personal religious journey. Conversely, he discouraged people from purchasing or possessing excessive material items, suggesting that any additional money earned could be given to provide for the poor.

Al-Ghazali believed that the imposition of income equality in society should not be a necessity. Instead, he advocated for individuals to be guided by the &quot;spirit of Islamic brotherhood,&quot; encouraging them to willingly share their wealth. However, he acknowledged that this ideal isn&#x27;t universally practiced. According to him, earned wealth can serve two potential purposes. The first is for the good of oneself, which includes maintaining one&#x27;s own health and that of their family, as well as extending care to others and engaging in actions beneficial to the Islamic community. The other is what al-Ghazali would consider misuse, spending it selfishly on extravagant or unnecessary material items.

In terms of trade, al-Ghazali discussed the necessity of exchanging goods across close cities as well as larger borders because it allows more goods, which may be necessary and not yet available, to be accessible to more people in various locations. He recognized the necessity of trade and its overall beneficial effect on the economy, but making money in that way might not be considered the most virtuous in his beliefs. He did not support people taking &quot;excessive&quot; profits from their trade sales.

== Reception of work ==
According to William Montgomery Watt, al-Ghazali was considered to be the mujaddid (&quot;Reviver&quot;) of his age. Many, perhaps most, later Muslims concurred and, according to Watt, some have even considered him to be the greatest Muslim after Muhammad.

As an example, the Islamic scholar al-Safadi stated: 

and the jurist, al-Yafi&#x27;i stated:

The Shafi&#x27;i jurist al-Subki stated:

Also a widely considered Sunni scholar, al-Dhahabi, in his praise of al-Ghazali wrote: &quot;Al-Ghazzaali, the imaam and shaykh, the prominent scholar, Hujjat al-Islam, the wonder of his time, Zayn al-Deen Abu Haamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Toosi al-Shaafa&#x27;i al-Ghazzaali, the author of many books and one possessed of utter intelligence. He studied fiqh in his own town, then he moved to Nisapur in the company of a group of students. He stayed with the Imaam al-Haramayn and gained a deep knowledge of fiqh within a short period. He became well-versed in &#x27;ilm al-kalaam and debate, until he became the best of debater.&quot;

Ibn Rushd (Averroes), a rationalist, famously responded that &quot;to say that philosophers are incoherent is itself to make an incoherent statement.&quot; Rushd&#x27;s book, &quot;The Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;, attempted to refute al-Ghazali&#x27;s views, but the work was not well received in the Muslim community.

According to historian Firas Alkhateeb, &quot;When one reads Imam al-Ghazali&#x27;s works at a very superficial level, one can easily misunderstand what he is saying as anti-scientific in general. The truth, however, is that al-Ghazali&#x27;s only warning to students is to not fully accept all the beliefs and ideas of a scholar simply because of his achievements in mathematics and science. By issuing such a warning, al-Ghazali is in fact protecting the scientific enterprise for future generations by insulating it from being mixed with theoretical philosophy that could eventually dilute science itself to a field based on conjecture and reasoning alone.&quot;

Al-Ghazali has been seen by Orientalist scholars as causing a decline in scientific advancement in Islam, because of his refutation of the new philosophies of his time. He purportedly saw danger in the statements made by philosophers that suggested that God was not all-knowing or even non-existent, which strongly contradicted his conservative Islamic belief. This position has been challenged, however. The following statement made by al-Ghazali has been described as evidence that he was not against scientific advancement: &quot;Great indeed is the crime against religion committed by anyone who supposes that Islam is to be championed by the denial of mathematical sciences.&quot; This sentence, the source of which is not indicated in the cited book, is taken from &quot;Deliverance from Error&quot;. Ghazali does not mean that neglecting the study of mathematics would be a crime against science or against reason, but that rejecting them is a crime against religion. Its aim is not to promote the study of mathematics: it is to condemn the attitude which consists in considering them as rivals of religion. For him, religion has nothing to fear from them, because they do not deal with the same subjects. To condemn the study of mathematics for fear that it endangers religion is to mistake the place of each of them. This is clarified by the sentence which immediately follows: &quot;For the revealed Law nowhere undertakes to deny or affirm these sciences, and the latter nowhere address themselves to religious matters.&quot; A few pages later, he writes that the books of the philosophers must be banned - he defines philosophy as composed of six branches: mathematical, logical, physical, metaphysical, political, and morale. Al-Ghazali notably influenced Ibn Rushd, Ayn al-Quzat Hamadani, al-Nawawi, Ibn Tumart, Fakhruddin Razi, Suyuti, Tan Malaka, Thomas Aquinas, David Hume, Sayf al-Din al-Amidi, Asad Mayhani, Ali al-Qari, Muhammad Ibn Yahya al-Janzi.

<doc id="146608" wikidata="Q380894" url="?curid=146608" title="Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh">
<text>Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh (; 12 February 1911 – 21 March 1978) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician, judge and barrister who served as the fifth president of Ireland from December 1974 to October 1976.

His birth name was registered in English as &quot;Carroll O&#x27;Daly&quot;, which he used during his legal career and which is recorded by some publications.

He also served as a Judge of the European Court of Justice from 1973 to 1974, Chief Justice of Ireland from 1961 to 1973, a Judge of the Supreme Court from 1953 to 1973, and Attorney General of Ireland from 1946 to 1948 and from 1951 to 1953.

==Early life==
Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, one of four children, was born on 12 February 1911, in Bray, County Wicklow. His father, Richard O&#x27;Daly, was a fishmonger with little interest in politics. His mother was Una Thornton.

Ó Dálaigh had an elder brother, Aonghus, and two younger sisters, Úna and Nuala. He went to St. Cronan&#x27;s Boys National School, and later to Synge Street CBS in Dublin. While attending University College Dublin, he became auditor of &quot;An Cumann Gaelach&quot; and of the Literary and Historical Society. He also became Irish language editor of &quot;The Irish Press&quot;.

==Legal career==
A graduate of University College Dublin, Ó Dálaigh was a committed Fianna Fáil supporter who served on the party&#x27;s National Executive in the 1930s; he became Ireland&#x27;s youngest Attorney General in 1946, under Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, serving until 1948. Unsuccessful in Dáil and Seanad elections in 1948 and 1951, he was re-appointed as Attorney General of Ireland in 1951. 

==Judicial career==
In 1953, he was nominated as the youngest-ever member of the Supreme Court by his mentor, de Valera. Less than a decade later, he became Chief Justice of Ireland, on the nomination of Taoiseach Seán Lemass. He was a keen actor in his early years and became a close friend of actor Cyril Cusack. It is commonly stated that Ó Dálaigh and Cusack picketed the Dublin launch of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot; in 1959, for what they felt was the film&#x27;s stereotyping of Irish people. However, there is no known contemporary reference to this having occurred.

He was an opponent of the US bombing of North Vietnam.

In 1972, Taoiseach Jack Lynch suggested to the opposition parties that they agree to nominate Ó Dálaigh to become President of Ireland when President de Valera&#x27;s second term ended in June of the following year. Fine Gael, confident that its prospective candidate Tom O&#x27;Higgins would win the 1973 presidential election (he had almost defeated de Valera in 1966), turned down the offer. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Erskine H. Childers went on to win the election that followed.

When Ireland joined the European Economic Community, Lynch nominated Ó Dálaigh as Ireland&#x27;s judge on the European Court of Justice. 

When President Childers died suddenly in 1974, all parties agreed to nominate Ó Dálaigh to replace him as President of Ireland.

==President of Ireland==
Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s tenure as president proved to be contentious. While popular with Irish language speakers and with artists, and respected by many republicans, he had a strained relationship with the then government led by Fine Gael, particularly with Minister Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien and Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave.

His decision, in 1976, to exercise his constitutional prerogative to refer a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality brought him into conflict with the Fine Gael-Labour National Coalition. Following the assassination of the British Ambassador, Christopher Ewart-Biggs, by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), on 23 July 1976, the government announced its intention to introduce legislation extending the maximum period of detention without charge from two to seven days.

Ó Dálaigh referred the resulting bill, the Emergency Powers Bill, to the Supreme Court. When the court ruled that the bill was constitutional, he signed the bill into law on 16 October 1976. On the same day, an IRA bomb in Mountmellick killed Michael Clerkin, a member of the Garda Síochána, the country&#x27;s police force. Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s actions were seen by government ministers to have contributed to the killing of this Garda given his delay in signing the Emergencies Powers Bill into law having referred it to the Supreme Court. On the following day, Minister for Defence Paddy Donegan, visiting a barracks in Mullingar to open a canteen, attacked the President for sending the bill to the Supreme Court, calling him a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot; (or possibly &quot;fucking disgrace&quot; or &quot;thundering bollocks&quot;).

Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s private papers show that he considered the relationship between the President (as Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces) and the Minister for Defence had been &quot;irrevocably broken&quot; by the comments of the Minister in front of the army Chief of Staff and other high-ranking officers. Donegan offered his resignation, but Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave refused to accept it. This proved the last straw for Ó Dálaigh, who believed that Cosgrave had additionally failed to meet his constitutional obligation to regularly brief the President on matters of state. He resigned from the presidency on 22 October 1976, &quot;to protect the dignity and independence of the presidency as an institution&quot;. He was succeeded as President of Ireland by Patrick Hillery.

<text>Romani ( ; also Romanes , Romany, Roma; ) is an Indo-Aryan macrolanguage of the Romani people. The largest of these are Vlax Romani (about 500,000 speakers), Balkan Romani (600,000), and Sinte Romani (300,000). Some Romani communities speak mixed languages based on the surrounding language with retained Romani-derived vocabulary – these are known by linguists as Para-Romani varieties, rather than dialects of the Romani language itself.

The differences between the various varieties can be as large as, for example, the differences between the Slavic languages.

== Name ==
Speakers of the Romani language usually refer to the language as &#x27; &quot;the Romani language&quot; or &quot; (adverb)&quot; &quot;in a Rom way&quot;. This derives from the Romani word &#x27;, meaning either &quot;a member of the (Romani) group&quot; or &quot;husband&quot;. This is also the origin of the term &quot;Roma&quot; in English, although some Roma groups refer to themselves using other demonyms (e.g. &#x27;Kaale&#x27;, &#x27;Sinti&#x27;).

== Classification ==
In the 18th century, it was shown by comparative studies that Romani belongs to the Indo-European language family. In 1763 Vályi István, a Calvinist pastor from Satu Mare in Transylvania, was the first to notice the similarity between Romani and Indo-Aryan by comparing the Romani dialect of Győr with the language (perhaps Sinhala) spoken by three Sri Lankan students he met in the Netherlands. This was followed by the linguist Johann Christian Christoph Rüdiger (1751–1822) whose book &#x27; (1782) posited Romani was descended from Sanskrit. This prompted the philosopher Christian Jakob Kraus to collect linguistic evidence by systematically interviewing the Roma in Königsberg prison. Kraus&#x27;s findings were never published, but they may have influenced or laid the groundwork for later linguists, especially August Pott and his pioneering &#x27; (1844–45). By the mid-nineteenth century the linguist and author George Borrow was able to state categorically his findings that it was a language with its origins in India, and he later published a glossary, &quot;Romano Lavo-lil&quot;. Research into the way the Romani dialects branched out was started in 1872 by the Slavicist Franz Miklosich in a series of essays. However, it was the philologist Ralph Turner&#x27;s 1927 article “The Position of Romani in Indo-Aryan” that served as the basis for the integration of Romani into the history of Indian languages.

Romani is an Indo-Aryan language that is part of the Balkan sprachbund. It is the only New Indo-Aryan spoken exclusively outside the Indian subcontinent.

Romani is sometimes classified in the Central Zone or Northwestern Zone Indo-Aryan languages, and sometimes treated as a group of its own.
Romani shares a number of features with the Central Zone languages. The most significant isoglosses are the shift of Old Indo-Aryan &quot;r̥&quot; to &quot;u&quot; or &quot;i&quot; (Sanskrit &#x27;, Romani &#x27; &#x27;to hear&#x27;) and &quot;kṣ-&quot; to &quot;kh&quot; (Sanskrit &#x27;, Romani &#x27; &#x27;eye&#x27;). However, unlike other Central Zone languages, Romani preserves many dental clusters (Romani &#x27; &#x27;three&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;brother&#x27;, compare Hindi &#x27;, &#x27;). This implies that Romani split from the Central Zone languages before the Middle Indo-Aryan period. However, Romani shows some features of New Indo-Aryan, such as erosion of the original nominal case system towards a nominative/oblique dichotomy, with new grammaticalized case suffixes added on. This means that the Romani exodus from India could not have happened until late in the first millennium.

Many words are similar to the Marwari and Lambadi languages spoken in large parts of India. Romani also shows some similarity to the Northwestern Zone languages. In particular, the grammaticalization of enclitic pronouns as person markers on verbs (&#x27; &#x27;done&#x27; + &#x27; &#x27;me&#x27; → &quot;&quot; &#x27;I did&#x27;) is also found in languages such as Kashmiri and Shina. This evidences a northwest migration during the split from the Central Zone languages consistent with a later migration to Europe.

Based on these data, Yaron Matras views Romani as &quot;kind of Indian hybrid: a central Indic dialect that had undergone partial convergence with northern Indic languages.&quot;

In terms of its grammatical structures, Romani is conservative in maintaining almost intact the Middle Indo-Aryan present-tense person concord markers, and in maintaining consonantal endings for nominal case – both features that have been eroded in most other modern Indo-Aryan languages.

Romani shows a number of phonetic changes that distinguish it from other Indo-Aryan languages – in particular, the devoicing of voiced aspirates (&quot;bh dh gh&quot; &gt; &quot;ph th kh&quot;), shift of medial &quot;t d&quot; to &quot;l&quot;, of short &quot;a&quot; to &quot;e&quot;, initial &quot;kh&quot; to &quot;x&quot;, rhoticization of retroflex &quot;ḍ, ṭ, ḍḍ, ṭṭ, ḍh&quot; etc. to &quot;r&quot; and &quot;ř&quot;, and shift of inflectional &quot;-a&quot; to &quot;-o&quot;.

After leaving the Indian subcontinent, Romani was heavily affected by contact with European languages. The most significant of these was Medieval Greek, which contributed lexically, phonemically, and grammatically to Early Romani (10th–13th centuries). This includes inflectional affixes for nouns, and verbs that are still productive with borrowed vocabulary, the shift to VO word order, and the adoption of a preposed definite article. Early Romani also borrowed from Armenian and Persian.

Romani and Domari share some similarities: agglutination of postpositions of the second layer (or case marking clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative. This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought to be the &quot;sister language&quot; of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the Indian subcontinent, but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central Zone (Hindustani) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom therefore likely descend from two different migration waves out of India, separated by several centuries.

== History ==

The first attestation of Romani is from 1542 AD in western Europe. The earlier history of the Romani language is completely undocumented, and is understood primarily through comparative linguistic evidence. 

Linguistic evaluation carried out in the nineteenth century by Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) showed the Romani language to be a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not a Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), establishing that the ancestors of the Romani could not have left India significantly earlier than AD 1000.

The principal argument favouring a migration during or after the transition period to NIA is the loss of the old system of nominal case, and its reduction to just a two-way case system, nominative vs. oblique. A secondary argument concerns the system of gender differentiation. Romani has only two genders (masculine and feminine). Middle Indo-Aryan languages (named MIA) generally had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and some modern Indo-Aryan languages retain this old system even today.

It is argued that loss of the neuter gender did not occur until the transition to NIA. Most of the neuter nouns became masculine while a few feminine, like the neuter (&#x27;) in the Prakrit became the feminine (&#x27;) in Hindi and &quot;&quot; in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages have been cited as evidence that the forerunner of Romani remained on the Indian subcontinent until a later period, perhaps even as late as the tenth century.

There is no historical proof to clarify who the ancestors of the Romani were or what motivated them to emigrate from the Indian subcontinent, but there are various theories. The influence of Greek, and to a lesser extent of Armenian and the Iranian languages (like Persian and Kurdish) points to a prolonged stay in Anatolia, Armenian highlands/Caucasus after the departure from South Asia. The latest territory where Romani is thought to have been spoken as a mostly unitary linguistic variety is the Byzantine Empire, between the 10th and the 13th centuries. The language of this period, which can be reconstructed on the basis of modern-day dialects, is referred to as &quot;Early Romani&quot; or &quot;Late Proto-Romani&quot;.

The Mongol invasion of Europe beginning in the first half of the thirteenth century triggered another westward migration. The Romani arrived in Europe and afterwards spread to the other continents. The great distances between the scattered Romani groups led to the development of local community distinctions. The differing local influences have greatly affected the modern language, splitting it into a number of different (originally exclusively regional) dialects.

Today, Romani is spoken by small groups in 42 European countries. A project at Manchester University in England is transcribing Romani dialects, many of which are on the brink of extinction, for the first time.

== Dialects ==

Today&#x27;s dialects of Romani are differentiated by the vocabulary accumulated since their departure from Anatolia, as well as through divergent phonemic evolution and grammatical features. Many Roma no longer speak the language or speak various new contact languages from the local language with the addition of Romani vocabulary.

Dialect differentiation began with the dispersal of the Romani from the Balkans around the 14th century and on, and with their settlement in areas across Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The two most significant areas of divergence are the southeast (with epicenter of the northern Balkans) and west-central Europe (with epicenter Germany). The central dialects replace &#x27; in grammatical paradigms with &#x27;. The northwestern dialects append &#x27;, simplify &#x27; to &#x27;, retain &#x27; in the nominalizer &#x27; / &#x27;, and lose adjectival past-tense in intransitives (&#x27;, &#x27; → &quot;&quot; &#x27;he/she went&#x27;). Other isoglosses (esp. demonstratives, 2/3pl perfective concord markers, loan verb markers) motivate the division into Balkan, Vlax, Central, Northeast, and Northwest dialects.

Matras (2002, 2005) has argued for a theory of geographical classification of Romani dialects, which is based on the diffusion in space of innovations. According to this theory, Early Romani (as spoken in the Byzantine Empire) was brought to western and other parts of Europe through population migrations of Rom in the 14th–15th centuries. These groups settled in the various European regions during the 16th and 17th centuries, acquiring fluency in a variety of contact languages. Changes emerged then, which spread in wave-like patterns, creating the dialect differences attested today. According to Matras, there were two major centres of innovations: some changes emerged in western Europe (Germany and vicinity), spreading eastwards; other emerged in the Wallachian area, spreading to the west and south. In addition, many regional and local isoglosses formed, creating a complex wave of language boundaries. Matras points to the prothesis of &#x27; in &#x27; &gt; &#x27; &#x27;egg&#x27; and &#x27; &gt; &#x27; &#x27;he&#x27; as typical examples of west-to-east diffusion, and of addition of prothetic &#x27; in &#x27; &gt; &#x27; as a typical east-to-west spread. His conclusion is that dialect differences formed in situ, and not as a result of different waves of migration.

According to this classification, the dialects are split as follows:
* Northern Romani dialects in western and northern Europe, southern Italy and the Iberian peninsula
* Central Romani dialects from southern Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Carpathian Ruthenia and southeastern Austria
* Balkan Romani dialects, including the Black Sea coast dialects
* Vlax Romani dialects, chiefly associated with the historical Wallachian and Transylvanian regions, with outmigrants in various regions throughout Europe and beyond

SIL Ethnologue has the following classification:

* Romani
** Balkan Romani
*** Arlija
*** Dzambazi
*** Tinners Romani
** Northern Romani
*** Baltic Romani
**** Estonian Romani
**** Latvian Romani (Lettish Romani)
**** North Russian Romani
**** Polish Romani
**** White Russian Romani
*** Carpathian Romani (Central Romani)
**** East Slovak Romani
**** Moravian Romani
**** West Slovak Romani
*** Finnish Kalo Romani
*** Sinte Romani
**** Abbruzzesi
**** Serbian Romani
**** Slovenian-Croatian Romani
*** Welsh Romani
** Vlax Romani
*** Churari (Churarícko, Sievemakers)
*** Eastern Vlax Romani (Bisa)
*** Ghagar
*** Grekurja (Greco)
*** Kalderash (Coppersmith, Kelderashícko)

*** Machvano (Machvanmcko)
*** North Albanian Romani
*** Sedentary Bulgaria Romani
*** Sedentary Romania Romani
*** Serbo-Bosnian Romani
*** South Albanian Romani
*** Ukraine-Moldavia Romani
*** Zagundzi
In a series of articles (beginning in 1982) linguist Marcel Courthiade proposed a different kind of classification. He concentrates on the dialectal diversity of Romani in three successive strata of expansion, using the criteria of phonological and grammatical changes. Finding the common linguistic features of the dialects, he presents the historical evolution from the first stratum (the dialects closest to the Anatolian Romani of the 13th century) to the second and third strata. He also names as &quot;pogadialects&quot; (after the &quot;&quot; dialect of Great Britain) those with only a Romani vocabulary grafted into a non-Romani language (normally referred to as Para-Romani).

A table of some dialectal differences:
The first stratum includes the oldest dialects: &#x27; (of Tirana), &#x27; (of Korça), &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; (of Pristina), &#x27; (&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;), &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; (from Finland), &#x27;, and the so-called &quot;Baltic dialects&quot;.

In the second there are &#x27; (of Podgorica), &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot; (of Agia Varvara)

The third comprises the rest of the Romani dialects, including &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;.

===Mixed languages===

Some Roma have developed mixed languages (chiefly by retaining Romani lexical items and adopting second language grammatical structures), including:
* in Northern Europe
** Angloromani (in England)
** Scottish Cant (in Lowland Scotland)
** Scandoromani (in Norway &amp; Sweden)
* in the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and France:
** Erromintxela (in the Basque Country)
** Caló (in Portugal, Brazil and Spain).
** Manouche (a variant of Sinte Romani in France and its Mediterranean borders from Spain to Italy)
* in Southeast Europe
** Romano-Greek
** Romano-Serbian
* in the Caucasus (Armenia)
** Lomavren

== Geographic distribution ==
Romani is the only Indo-Aryan language spoken almost exclusively in Europe.

The most concentrated areas of Romani speakers are found in the Balkans and central Europe, particularly in Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Slovakia. Although there are no reliable figures for the exact number of Romani speakers, the estimated amount of Romani speakers in the European Union is around 3.5 million, this makes it the largest spoken minority language in the European Union.

== Status ==
The language is recognized as a minority language in many countries. At present the only places in the world where Romani is employed as an official language are the Republic of Kosovo (only regionally, not nationally) and the Šuto Orizari Municipality within the administrative borders of Skopje, North Macedonia&#x27;s capital.

The first efforts to publish in Romani were undertaken in the interwar Soviet Union (using the Cyrillic script) and in socialist Yugoslavia. Portions and selections of the Bible have been translated to many different forms of the Romani language. The entire Bible has been translated to Kalderash Romani.

Some traditional communities have expressed opposition to codifying Romani or having it used in public functions. However, the mainstream trend has been towards standardization.

Different variants of the language are now in the process of being codified in those countries with high Romani populations (for example, Slovakia). There are also some attempts currently aimed at the creation of a unified standard language.

A standardized form of Romani is used in Serbia, and in Serbia&#x27;s autonomous province of Vojvodina, Romani is one of the officially recognized languages of minorities having its own radio stations and news broadcasts.

In Romania, a country with a sizable Romani minority (3.3% of the total population), there is a unified teaching system of the Romani language for all dialects spoken in the country. This is primarily a result of the work of Gheorghe Sarău, who made Romani textbooks for teaching Romani children in the Romani language. He teaches a purified, mildly prescriptive language, choosing the original Indo-Aryan words and grammatical elements from various dialects. The pronunciation is mostly like that of the dialects from the first stratum. When there are more variants in the dialects, the variant that most closely resembles the oldest forms is chosen, like &#x27;, instead of &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; instead of &#x27;, &#x27; instead of &#x27; or &#x27;, etc.

An effort is also made to derive new words from the vocabulary already in use, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &#x27; (airplane), &#x27; (slide rule), &#x27; (retrospectively), &#x27; (adjective). There is an ever-changing set of borrowings from Romanian as well, including such terms as &#x27; (weather, time), &#x27; (town hall), &#x27; (cream), &#x27; (saint, holy). Hindi-based neologisms include &#x27; (bulb, electricity), &#x27; (example), &#x27; (drawing, design), &#x27; (writing), while there are also English-based neologisms, like &quot;&quot; &lt; &quot;to print&quot;.

Romani is now used on the internet, in some local media, and in some countries as a medium of instruction.

== Orthography ==
Historically, Romani was an exclusively unwritten language; for example, Slovak Romani&#x27;s orthography was codified only in 1971.

The overwhelming majority of academic and non-academic literature produced currently in Romani is written using a Latin-based orthography.
The proposals to form a unified Romani alphabet and one standard Romani language by either choosing one dialect as a standard, or by merging more dialects together, have not been successful - instead, the trend is towards a model where each dialect has its own writing system. Among native speakers, the most common pattern is for individual authors to use an orthography based on the writing system of the dominant contact language: thus Romanian in Romania, Hungarian in Hungary and so on.

To demonstrate the differences, the phrase /romani tʃʰib/, which means &quot;Romani language&quot; in all the dialects, can be written as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot; and so on.

A currently observable trend, however, appears to be the adoption of a loosely English- and Czech-oriented orthography, developed spontaneously by native speakers for use online and through email.

== Phonology ==
The following is the core sound inventory of Romani. are only found in some dialects.

Loans from contact languages often allow other non-native phonemes.

===Consonants===
The Romani sound system is not highly unusual among European languages. Its most marked features are a three-way contrast between unvoiced, voiced, and aspirated stops, and the presence in some dialects of a second rhotic .


Eastern and Southeastern European Romani dialects commonly have palatalized consonants, either distinctive or allophonic.

In some varieties such as Slovak Romani, at the end of a word, voiced consonants become voiceless and aspirated ones lose aspiration. Some examples:

===Vowels===
Vowel length is often distinctive in Western European Romani dialects.

===Stress===
Conservative dialects of Romani have final stress, with the exception of some unstressed affixes (e.g. the vocative ending, the case endings added on to the accusative noun, and the remoteness tense marker). Central and Western European dialects often have shifted stress earlier in the word.

== Lexicon ==

==Morphology==
===Nominals===
Nominals in Romani are nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals. Some sources describe articles as nominals.

The indefinite article is often borrowed from the local contact language.

==== Types ====
General Romani is an unusual language, in having two classes of nominals, based on the historic origin of the word, that have a completely different morphology. The two classes can be called &quot;inherited&quot; and &quot;borrowed&quot;, but this article uses names from Matras (2006), &quot;ikeoclitic&quot; and &quot;xenoclitic&quot;. The class to which a word belongs is obvious from its ending.

===== Ikeoclitic =====
The first class is the old, Indian vocabulary (and to some extent Persian, Armenian and Greek loanwords). The ikeoclitic class can also be divided into two sub-classes, based on the ending.

====== Nominals ending in o/i ======
The ending of words in this sub-class is -o with masculines, -i with feminines, with the latter ending triggering palatalisation of preceding &quot;d, t, n, l&quot; to &quot;ď, ť, ň, ľ&quot;.

Examples:
*masculine
** - the son
** - the little
** - our (m.)
*feminine
** - non-romani girl
** - small (note the change n &gt; ň)
** - ours (f.)

====== Nominals without ending ======
All words in this sub-class have no endings, regardless of gender.

Examples:
*masculine
** - the brother
** - the nice (m.)
** - the father
*feminine
** - the sister
** - the nice (f.) - same as m.
** - the mother

===== Xenoclitic =====
The second class is loanwords from European languages. (Matras adds that the morphology of the new loanwords might be borrowed from Greek.)

The ending of borrowed masculine is -os, -is, -as, -us, and the borrowed feminine ends in -a.

Examples from Slovak Romani:
*masculine
** - shoemaker
** - bus
** - teacher (m.)
*feminine
** - shirt
** - window
** - teacher (f.)

==== Basics of morphology ====
Romani has two grammatical genders (masculine / feminine) and two numbers (singular / plural).

All nominals can be singular or plural.

==== Cases ====
Nouns are marked for any of eight cases; nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, ablative, and instrumental. The former three are formed by inflections on the noun itself, but the latter five are marked by adding postpositions to the accusative, used as an &quot;indirect root.&quot;

The vocative and nominative are a bit &quot;outside&quot; of the case system as they are produced only by adding a suffix to the root.

Example: the suffix for singular masculine vocative of ikeoclitic types is .
* - you, boy (or son)!
* - you, little one!
* - brother!

The oblique cases disregard gender or type: &#x27; / &#x27; (locative), &#x27; / &#x27; (dative), &#x27; (ablative), &#x27; (instrumental and comitative), and &#x27; / &#x27; (genitive).

Example: The endings for o/i ending nominals are as follows:
Example: the suffix for indirect root for masculine plural for all inherited words is &#x27;, the dative suffix is &#x27;.
* - mushroom
* - the indirect root (also used as accusative)
* – In the summer we go on mushrooms (meaning picking mushrooms)

There are many declension classes of nouns that decline differently, and show dialectal variation.

Parts of speech such as adjectives and the article, when they function as attributes before a word, distinguish only between a nominative and an indirect/oblique case form. In the Early Romani system that most varieties preserve, declinable adjectives had nominative endings similar to the nouns ending in &quot;-o&quot; (masculine &quot;-o&quot;, feminine &quot;-i&quot;) but the oblique endings &quot;-e&quot; in the masculine, &quot;-a&quot; in the feminine. The ending &quot;-e&quot; was the same regardless of gender. So-called athematic adjectives had the nominative forms &quot;-o&quot; in the masculine &quot;and&quot; the feminine and &quot;-a&quot; in the plural; the oblique has the same endings as the previous group, but the preceding stem changes by adding the element &quot;-on-&quot;.

==== Agreement ====
Romani shows the typically Indo-Aryan pattern of the genitive agreeing with its head noun.

Example:
* &quot; - &#x27;the boy&#x27;s brother&#x27;
* &quot; - &#x27;the boy&#x27;s sister&#x27;.

Adjectives and the definite article show agreement with the noun they modify.

Example:
* &quot; - &#x27;my father&#x27;
* &quot; - &#x27;my mother&#x27;.

=== Verbs ===
Romani derivations are highly synthetic and partly agglutinative. However, they are also sensitive to recent development - for example, in general, Romani in Slavic countries show an adoption of productive aktionsart morphology.

The core of the verb is the lexical root, verb morphology is suffixed.

The verb stem (including derivation markers) by itself has non-perfective aspect and is present or subjunctive.

==== Types ====
Similarly to nominals, verbs in Romani belong to several classes, but unlike nominals, these are not based on historical origin. However, the loaned verbs can be recognized, again, by specific endings, which are Greek in origin.

===== Irregular verbs =====
Some words are irregular, like &quot;&quot; - to be.

===== Class I =====
The next three classes are recognizable by suffix in 3rd person singular.

The first class, called I., has a suffix &quot; in 3rd person singular.

Examples, in 3 ps. sg:
*&quot; - to do
*&quot; - to hear
*&quot; - to see

===== Class II =====
Words in the second category, called II., have a suffix &quot; in 3rd person singular.

Examples, in 3 ps. sg:
*&quot; - to go
*&quot; - to be ashamed, shy away.
*&quot; - to laugh
*&quot; - to believe
*&quot; - to eat

===== Class III =====
All the words in the third class are semantically causative passive.

Examples:
*&quot; - to learn
*&quot; - to burn
*&quot; - to be beaten
*&quot; - to lie

===== Borrowed verbs =====
Borrowed verbs from other languages are marked with affixes taken from Greek tense/aspect suffixes, including &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;.

==== Morphology ====
The Romani verb has three persons and two numbers, singular and plural. There is no verbal distinction between masculine and feminine.

Romani tenses are, not exclusively, present tense, future tense, two past tenses (perfect and imperfect), present or past conditional and present imperative.

Depending on the dialect, the suffix &#x27; marks the present, future, or conditional. There are many perfective suffixes, which are determined by root phonology, valency, and semantics: e.g. &#x27; &#x27;did&#x27;.

There are two sets of personal conjugation suffixes, one for non-perfective verbs, and another for perfective verbs. The non-perfective personal suffixes, continued from Middle Indo-Aryan, are as follows:
These are slightly different for consonant- and vowel-final roots (e.g. &#x27; &#x27;you eat&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;you want&#x27;).

The perfective suffixes, deriving from late Middle Indo-Aryan enclitic pronouns, are as follows:
Verbs may also take a further remoteness suffix whose original form must have been &#x27; and which is preserved in different varieties as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; or &quot;. With non-perfective verbs this marks the imperfect, habitual, or conditional. With the perfective, this marks the pluperfect or counterfactual.

===== Class I =====
All the persons and numbers of present tense of the word &quot;&quot; in East Slovak Romani.
Various tenses of the same word, all in 2nd person singular.
*present - &quot;
*future - &quot; (many other dialects use a future particle such as &quot;ka&quot; preceding the imperfective form : &quot;)&quot;
*past imperfect = present conditional - &quot;
*past perfect - &#x27; (&#x27; + &#x27; + &#x27;)
*past conditional - &#x27; (&#x27; + &#x27; + &#x27; + &quot;)
*present imperative - &quot;

===== Class II =====
All the persons and numbers of present tense of the word &quot; in East Slovak Romani.
Various tenses of the word &quot;&quot;, all in 2nd person singular.
*present - &quot;
*future - &quot;
*past imperfect = present conditional - &quot;
*past perfect - &#x27; (irregular - regular form of &#x27; is &quot;)
*past conditional - &quot;
*present imperative - &quot;

===== Class III =====
All the persons and numbers of present tense of the word &#x27; in East Slovak Romani. Note the added &#x27;, which is typical for this group.
Various tenses of the same word, all in 2nd person singular again.
*present - &quot;
*future - &quot;
*past imperfect = present conditional - &quot;
*past perfect - &#x27; (&#x27; + &#x27; + &#x27;)
*past conditional - &#x27; (&#x27; + &#x27; + &#x27; + &quot;)
*present imperative - &quot;

==== Valency ====
Valency markers are affixed to the verb root either to increase or decrease valency. There is dialectal variation as to which markers are most used; common valency-increasing markers are &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;, and common valency-decreasing markers are &#x27; and &quot;. These may also be used to derive verbs from nouns and adjectives.

Romani makes use of valency-changing morphology which increases or decreases the valency of its verbs.

== Syntax ==
Romani syntax is quite different from most Indo-Aryan languages, and shows more similarity to the Balkan languages.

Šebková and Žlnayová, while describing Slovak Romani, argues that Romani is a free word order language and that it allows for theme-rheme structure, similarly to Czech, and that in some Romani dialects in East Slovakia, there is a tendency to put a verb at the end of a sentence.

However, Matras describes it further. According to Matras, in most dialects of Romani, Romani is a VO language, with SVO order in contrastive sentences and VSO order in thetic sentences. The tendency of some dialects to put the verb in final position may be due to Slavic influence.

Examples, from Slovak Romani:
* &quot; - This cup is cold.
* &quot; - This is a cold cup.

Clauses are usually finite. relative clauses, introduced by the relativizer &quot;kaj&quot;, are postponed. Factual and non-factual complex clauses are distinguished.

== Romani in modern times ==
Romani has lent several words to English such as &quot;pal&quot; (ultimately from Sanskrit &quot;&quot; &quot;brother&quot;). Other Romani words in general British slang are &quot;gadgie&quot; (man), &quot;shiv&quot; or &quot;chiv&quot; (knife). Urban British slang shows an increasing level of Romani influence, with some words becoming accepted into the lexicon of standard English (for example, &quot;chav&quot; from an assumed Anglo-Romani word, meaning &quot;small boy&quot;, in the majority of dialects). There are efforts to teach and familiarise Vlax-Romani to a new generation of Romani so that Romani spoken in different parts of the world are connected through a single dialect of Romani. The Indian Institute of Romani Studies, Chandigarh published several Romani language lessons through its journal &quot;Roma&quot; during the 1970s.

Occasionally loanwords from other Indo-Iranian languages, such as Hindi, are mistakenly labelled as Romani due to surface similarities (due to a shared root), such as &quot;cushy&quot;, which is from Urdu (itself a loan from Persian &quot;&quot;) meaning &quot;excellent, healthy, happy&quot;.

<text>Different cultures used different traditional numeral systems for naming large numbers. The extent of large numbers used varied in each culture. Two interesting points in using large numbers are the confusion on the term billion and milliard in many countries, and the use of &quot;zillion&quot; to denote a very large number where precision is not required.

==Indian mathematics==

The Shukla Yajurveda has a list of names for powers of ten up to 1012.
The list given in the Yajurveda text is: 
:&quot;eka&quot; (1), &quot;daśa&quot; (10), &quot;mesochi&quot; (100), &quot;sahasra&quot; (1,000), &quot;ayuta&quot; (10,000), &quot;niyuta&quot; (100,000), &quot;prayuta&quot; (1,000,000), &quot;arbuda&quot; (10,000,000), &quot;nyarbuda&quot; (100,000,000), &quot;saguran&quot; (1,000,000,000), &quot;madhya&quot; (10,000,000,000), &quot;anta&quot; (100,000,000,000), &quot;parârdha&quot; (1,000,000,000,000).
Later Hindu and Buddhist texts have extended this list, but these lists are no longer mutually consistent and names of numbers larger than 108 differ between texts.

For example, the Panchavimsha Brahmana lists 109 as &quot;nikharva&quot;, 1010 &quot;vâdava&quot;, 1011 &quot;akṣiti&quot;, while Śâṅkhyâyana Śrauta Sûtra has 109 &quot;nikharva&quot;, 1010 &quot;samudra&quot;, 1011 &quot;salila&quot;, 1012 &quot;antya&quot;, 1013 &quot;ananta&quot;. Such lists of names for powers of ten are called &quot;daśaguṇottarra saṁjñâ&quot;. There area also analogous lists of Sanskrit names for fractional numbers, that is, powers of one tenth.

The Mahayana &quot;Lalitavistara Sutra&quot; is notable for giving a very extensive such list, with terms going up to 10421. The context is an account of a contest including writing, arithmetic, wrestling and archery, in which the Buddha was pitted against the great mathematician Arjuna and showed off his numerical skills by citing the names of the powers of ten up to 1 &#x27;tallakshana&#x27;, which equals 1053, but then going on to explain that this is just one of a series of counting systems that can be expanded geometrically.

The Avataṃsaka Sūtra, a text associated with the Lokottaravāda school of Buddhism, has an even more extensive list of names for numbers, and it goes beyond listing mere powers of ten introducing concatenation of exponentiation, the largest number mentioned being &quot;nirabhilapya nirabhilapya parivarta&quot; (Bukeshuo bukeshuo zhuan 不可說不可說轉), corresponding to formula_1. though chapter 30 (the Asamkyeyas) in Thomas Cleary&#x27;s translation of it we find the definition of the number &quot;untold&quot; as exactly 1010*2122, expanded in the 2nd verses to 104*5*2121 and continuing a similar expansion indeterminately.
Examples for other names given in the Avatamsaka Sutra include: &quot;asaṃkhyeya&quot; (असंख्येय) 10140.

The Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders: enumerable (lowest, intermediate, and highest), innumerable (nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable), and infinite (nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite).

In modern India, the terms lakh for 105 and crore for 107 are in common use. Both are vernacular (Hindustani) forms derived from a list of names for powers of ten in Yājñavalkya Smṛti, where 105 and 107 named &quot;lakṣa&quot; and &quot;koṭi&quot;, respectively.

==Classical antiquity==
In the Western world, specific number names for larger numbers did not come into common use until quite recently. The Ancient Greeks used a system based on the myriad, that is, ten thousand, and their largest named number was a myriad myriad, or one hundred million.

In &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;, Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC) devised a system of naming large numbers reaching up to 

:formula_2,

essentially by naming powers of a myriad myriad. This largest number appears because it equals a myriad myriad to the myriad myriadth power, all taken to the myriad myriadth power. This gives a good indication of the notational difficulties encountered by Archimedes, and one can propose that he stopped at this number because he did not devise any new ordinal numbers (larger than &#x27;myriad myriadth&#x27;) to match his new cardinal numbers. Archimedes only used his system up to 1064. 

Archimedes&#x27; goal was presumably to name large powers of 10 in order to give rough estimates, but shortly thereafter, Apollonius of Perga invented a more practical system of naming large numbers which were not powers of 10, based on naming powers of a myriad, for example, would be a myriad squared. 

Much later, but still in antiquity, the Hellenistic mathematician Diophantus (3rd century) used a similar notation to represent large numbers.

The Romans, who were less interested in theoretical issues, expressed 1,000,000 as &quot;decies centena milia&quot;, that is, &#x27;ten hundred thousand&#x27;; it was only in the 13th century that the (originally French) word &#x27;million&#x27; was introduced.

==Modern use of large finite numbers==
Far larger finite numbers than any of these occur in modern mathematics. For instance, Graham&#x27;s number is too large to reasonably express using exponentiation or even tetration. For more about modern usage for large numbers, see Large numbers. To handle these numbers, new notations are created and used. There is a large community of mathematicians dedicated to naming large numbers. Rayo&#x27;s number has been claimed to be the largest named number.

== Infinity ==
The ultimate in large numbers was, until recently, the concept of infinity, a number defined by being greater than any finite number, and used in the mathematical theory of limits.

However, since the 19th century, mathematicians have studied transfinite numbers, numbers which are not only greater than any finite number, but also, from the viewpoint of set theory, larger than the traditional concept of infinity. Of these transfinite numbers, perhaps the most extraordinary, and arguably, if they exist, &quot;largest&quot;, are the large cardinals.

<text>George Alexander Parks (May 29, 1883 – May 11, 1984) was an American engineer who worked in Alaska Territory for most of his career. Following an unexpected nomination from President Calvin Coolidge, he became the territory&#x27;s first resident governor. As governor, he was the first person to serve two complete four-year terms and the first chief executive to travel extensively by air.

==Background==
Parks was born to James and Mary Leach (Ferguson) Parks on May 29, 1883, in Denver, Colorado. He was educated in public schools before graduating from the Colorado School of Mines in 1906. After graduation, he worked as a mining engineer in Canada, Mexico, and the Western United States before arriving in Alaska in 1907 as part of an engineering team tasked with making evaluations for a group of investors.
In 1908, Parks worked for the United States Land Office in Denver as a mineral examiner for two months before taking a similar position in Alaska. Following the American entry into World War I, he joined the Army Corps of Engineers. Rising to the rank of captain by the war&#x27;s end, he returned to the Land office after his military service.

In 1920, Parks was appointed Chief of the United States Land Office in Juneau. Four years later he was in Anchorage working as Assistant Supervisor of Surveys of Public Lands for Alaska. During his time with the land office, he traveled extensively throughout the territory, gaining an intimate knowledge of the geography and becoming acquainted with both the white and indigenous populations of Alaska.

==Governorship==
While President Warren G. Harding, Hubert Work, and Herbert Hoover were visiting Alaska, Parks was assigned as a tour guide for the dignitaries. The group was impressed by their guide&#x27;s detailed knowledge of the territory. When President Calvin Coolidge was later looking for a new territorial governor, Work and Hoover, who by then were both members of the Presidential Cabinet, recommended Parks. Coolidge nominated Parks to be Governor of Alaska Territory on February 14, 1925, and the new governor took his oath of office on June 17, 1925.

Transportation was a major issue for the territory during the Parks administration. To offset running deficits and reduced federal subsidies, rates for the Alaska Railroad were raised and a toll was implemented on the Richardson Highway. One area that saw an improvement however was air travel. In 1925 funds for landing fields was authorized by the territorial legislature. Two years later subsidized air travel between the Alaska Railroad and Seward Peninsula was initiated. Parks became an avid enthusiast of air travel, using it to inspect much of the territory in May and June 1929. The speed and increased mobility even allowed him to attend his niece&#x27;s graduation in California.

Much of Parks&#x27; term of office was largely uneventful. Among the issues he dealt with were the reduction in federal funding for the United States Geological Survey and elimination of the territory&#x27;s agricultural experimentation stations. He also initiated a contest among school children to design a territorial flag.

Parks was reappointed for a second term by President Hoover on September 27, 1929.
 He left office on April 19, 1933, following the completion of his term.

==Later life==
After leaving the governor&#x27;s office, Parks settled in Juneau and became District Cadastral Engineer of Alaska. He remained there until his retirement from the Bureau of Land Management in July 1948. After leaving government service, he worked for the R.J. Sommers Construction Company and became Vice-President of the First National Bank of Juneau.

Parks never married. During the mid-1970s, Parks was forced to leave his Juneau apartment and move into a nursing home. In 1975, the Parks Highway (Alaska Route 3) between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, was named in his honor. Parks died on May 11, 1984, at the age of 100 in Juneau, Alaska.

<text>The are numerals that are used in Japanese. In writing, they are the same as the Chinese numerals, and large numbers follow the Chinese style of grouping by 10,000. Two pronunciations are used: the Sino-Japanese () readings of the Chinese characters and the Japanese (native words, readings).

==Basic numbering in Japanese== 
There are two ways of writing the numbers in Japanese: in Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) or in Chinese numerals (, , ). The Arabic numerals are more often used in horizontal writing, and the Chinese numerals are more common in vertical writing.

Most numbers have two readings, one derived from Chinese used for cardinal numbers (reading) and a native Japanese reading (reading) used somewhat less formally for numbers up to 10. In some cases (listed below) the Japanese reading is generally preferred for all uses. Archaic readings are marked with †.

* The special reading is also found. It may be optionally used when reading individual digits of a number one after another, instead of as a full number. A popular example is the famous 109 store in Shibuya, Tokyo which is read as (Kanji: ). (It can also be read as &#x27;ten-nine&#x27;—pronounced —which is a pun on the name of the Tokyo department store which owns the building.) This usage of for numerical 0 is similar to reading numeral 0 in English as &quot;oh&quot;. However, as a number, it is only written as 0 or . Additionally, two and five are pronounced with a long vowel in phone numbers (i.e. and ).

As noted above, (4) and (7) are preferred to and . It is purported that this is because is also the reading of the word , which makes it an unlucky reading (see tetraphobia); while may sound too similar to (1), or (8). However, in quite a number of established words and phrases, and are preferred; additionally, when counting (as in &quot;&quot;), and may be preferred.

The number 9 is also considered unlucky; when pronounced , it is a homophone for . The number 13 is sometimes considered unlucky, though this is a carryover from Western tradition. In contrast, 7 and sometimes 8 are considered lucky in Japanese.

In modern Japanese, cardinal numbers except 4 and 7 are generally given the readings. Alternate readings are used in month names, day-of-month names, and fixed phrases; for instance, April, July, and September are called (4th month), (7th month), and (9th month) respectively (for further detail see Japanese counter word#Exceptions). The readings are also used when shouting out headcounts (e.g. ).

Larger numbers are made by combining these elements:

*Tens from 20 to 90 are &quot;(digit)&quot; as in to .
*Hundreds from 200 to 900 are &quot;(digit)&quot;.
*Thousands from 2000 to 9000 are &quot;(digit)&quot;.

Starting at a , numbers begin with if no digit would otherwise precede. That is, 100 is just , and 1000 is just , but 10000 is , not just *. (This differs from Chinese, where numbers begin with if no digit would otherwise precede starting at 100.) And, if directly precedes the name of powers of myriad, is normally attached before , which yields . That is, 10,000,000 (parsed as 1000,0000) is normally read as . But if does &quot;not&quot; directly precede the name of powers of myriad, attaching is optional. That is, 15,000,000 (1500,0000) is read as or , just as 1500 is read as or .

There are some phonetic modifications to larger numbers involving voicing or gemination of certain consonants, as typically occurs in Japanese (i.e. ): e.g. &quot;six&quot; and &quot;hundred&quot; yield &quot;six hundred&quot;.
* This also applies to multiples of 10. Change ending to or .
** This also applies to multiples of 100. Change ending to .

In numbers above 10, elements are combined from largest to smallest, and zeros are implied. Japanese numerals are multiplicative additive rather than positional; to write the number 20 you get the character for and then the character for to get two tens or .
===Other types of numerals===
For ordinal numbers, see Japanese counter word#Ordinal numbers.

Distributive numbers are formed regularly from a cardinal number, a counter word, and the suffix , as in .

== Powers of 10 ==

=== Large numbers ===

Following Chinese tradition, large numbers are created by grouping digits into myriads (every 10,000) rather than the Western thousands (1,000):
Variation is due to the , Japan&#x27;s oldest mathematics text. The initial edition was published in 1627 and had many errors, most of which were fixed in the 1631 edition. In 1634, there was yet another edition which again changed a few values. The above variation is due to inconsistencies in the latter two editions. There are different characters for 10 (of which is in Chinese today), and after 10 they differ in whether they continue increasing by a factor of 10 or switch to 10. (If by a factor of 10, the intervening factors of 10 are produced with . The current edition of the , the 11th, follows a factor of 10 throughout, though some people still use the values from the 8th edition even today.)

The first three numbers with multisyllabic names and variation in assigned values ultimately derive from India, though they did not have defined values there. was originally used in Buddhist scripture for an indefinitely large quantity; it derives from the Sanskrit &#x27;Ganges&#x27; (which conveniently includes the character ) and , referring to the innumerable sands of the Ganges River. , from Sanskrit &#x27;uncountable/innumerable&#x27;, with the negative prefix , and is from Sanskrit . After that, the numbers are Buddhist terms translated into or coined in Chinese and later assigned numerical values: and . 

Examples: &quot;(spacing by groups of four digits is given only for clarity of explanation)&quot;
*1 0000 : 
*983 6703 : 
*20 3652 1801 : 

However, numbers written in Arabic numerals are separated by commas every three digits following English-speaking convention. If Arabic numbers and kanji are used in combination, Western orders of magnitude may be used for numbers smaller than 10,000 (e.g. for 25,000,000).

In Japanese, when long numbers are written out in kanji, zeros are omitted for all powers of ten. Hence 4002 is (in contrast, Chinese requires the use of wherever a zero appears, e.g. for 4002). However, when reading out a statement of accounts, for example, the skipped digit or digits are sometimes indicated by or ): e.g. or instead of the normal .

=== Decimal fractions ===

Japanese has two systems of numerals for decimal fractions. They are no longer in general use, but are still used in some instances such as batting and fielding averages of baseball players, winning percentages for sports teams, and in some idiomatic phrases such as , and when representing a rate or discount. The fractions are also used when talking about fevers—for example for 9 and two parts—referring to the temperature 39.2°C.

One system is as follows:

This is the system used with the traditional Japanese units of measurement. Several of the names are used &quot;as is&quot; to represent a fraction of a .

The other system of representing these decimal fractions of rate or discount uses a system &quot;shifted down&quot; with a becoming a &quot;one hundredth&quot; and so on, and the unit for &quot;tenth&quot; becoming :

This is often used with prices. For example:
*: 15% discount
*: batting average .389

With the exception of , these are rarely seen in modern usage. Decimal fractions are typically written with either kanji numerals (vertically) or Arabic numerals (horizontally), preceded by a decimal point, and are read as successive digits, as in Western convention. Note that, in written form, they can be combined with either the traditional system of expressing numerals (42.195 kilometers: ), in which powers of ten are written, or with the place value system, which uses zero (50.04 percent: ) In both cases, however, the reading follows the traditional system ( for 42.195 kilometers; for 50.04 percent.)

== Formal numbers ==

As with Chinese numerals, there exists in Japanese a separate set of kanji for numerals called used in legal and financial documents to prevent unscrupulous individuals from adding a stroke or two, turning a one into a two or a three. The formal numbers are identical to the Chinese formal numbers except for minor stroke variations. Today, the numbers for one, two, three, and ten are written only in their formal form in legal documents (the numbers 4 to 9 as well as 100, 1000 and 10000 are written identically to the common ones, cf. table below). These numbers&#x27; common forms can be changed to a higher value by adding strokes (1 and 2 were explained above, while 3 can be changed to 5, and 10 to 1000). In some cases, the digit 1 is explicitly written like for 110, as opposed to in common writing.

Formal numbers:
The four current banknotes of the Japanese yen, 1000-yen, 2000-yen, 5000-yen, and 10000-yen, have formal numbers , , , and , respectively.

==Old Japanese==

Old Japanese shares some vocabulary with later periods, but there are also unique number terms over 10 which are not used any more, aside from being parts of specific lexemes.

Notes:
* The transcription is based on the phoneme and is not phonetic. See Old Japanese for further information.
* See for information on subscript notation.


==Hand counting==
Japanese uses separate systems for counting for oneself and for displaying numbers to others, which both proceed up to ten. For counting, one begins with the palm open, then counts up to five by curling up (folding down) the fingers, starting from the thumb – thus one has just the thumb down (and others extended), while four has only the little finger extended, and five has a fist. One then counts up to ten by proceeding in the reverse order, extending the fingers, starting at the little finger – thus six is the same as four, seven the same as three, and so forth, with ten ending with the palm open. While this introduces ambiguity, it is not used to present to others, so this is generally not a problem. When displaying for others, one starts with the hand closed, and extends fingers, starting with the index, going to the little finger, then ending with the thumb, as in the United States. For numbers above five, one uses an open hand (indicating five) and places the appropriate number of fingers from the other hand against the palm (palms facing each other) – so six has the index finger against the palm, and so forth. To display ten, one presents both hands open and palm outwards.

== Digits in written words ==
Since the adoption of Arabic numerals, numbers have become written in Arabic numerals more and more often. Counters and ordinal numbers are typically written in Arabic numbers, such as , , , etc., although , and are also acceptable to write (albeit less common). However, numbers that are part of lexemes are typically written in kanji. For example, the term translates into &quot;800 store&quot; and uses the Old Japanese pronunciation for 800, . The notorious Japanese organized crime syndicate, the yakuza, can be written (or 893), a hand in that is worth 0 points, indicating that yakuza are &quot;worthless persons&quot; or &quot;gambling persons&quot;.

<doc id="146625" wikidata="Q1786640" url="?curid=146625" title="Wreath product">
<text>In group theory, the wreath product is a special combination of two groups based on the semidirect product. It is formed by the action of one group on many copies of another group, somewhat analogous to exponentiation. Wreath products are used in the classification of permutation groups and also provide a way of constructing interesting examples of groups.

Given two groups formula_1 and formula_2 (sometimes known as the &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot;), there exist two variants of the wreath product: the unrestricted wreath product formula_3 and the restricted wreath product formula_4. The general form, denoted by formula_5 or formula_6 respectively, requires that formula_2 acts on some set formula_8; when unspecified, usually formula_9 (a regular wreath product), though a different formula_8 is sometimes implied. The two variants coincide when formula_1, formula_2, and formula_8 are all finite. Either variant is also denoted as formula_14 (with \wr for the LaTeX symbol) or &quot;A&quot; ≀ &quot;H&quot; (Unicode U+2240).

The notion generalizes to semigroups and, as such, is a central construction in the Krohn–Rhodes structure theory of finite semigroups.

== Definition ==

Let formula_1 be a group and let formula_2 be a group acting on a set formula_8 (on the left). The direct product formula_18 of formula_1 with itself indexed by formula_8 is the set of sequences formula_21 in formula_1, indexed by formula_8, with a group operation given by pointwise multiplication. The action of formula_2 on formula_8 can be extended to an action on formula_18 by &quot;reindexing&quot;, namely by defining

: formula_27

for all formula_28 and all formula_29.

Then the unrestricted wreath product formula_5 of formula_1 by formula_2 is the semidirect product formula_33 with the action of formula_2 on formula_18 given above. The subgroup formula_18 of formula_33 is called the base of the wreath product.

The restricted wreath product formula_6 is constructed in the same way as the unrestricted wreath product except that one uses the direct sum as the base of the wreath product. In this case, the base consists of all sequences in formula_18 with finitely many non-identity entries. The two definitions coincide when formula_8 is finite.

In the most common case, formula_9, and formula_2 acts on itself by left multiplication. In this case, the unrestricted and restricted wreath product may be denoted by formula_3 and formula_4 respectively. This is called the regular wreath product.

== Notation and conventions ==

The structure of the wreath product of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;H&quot; depends on the &quot;H&quot;-set Ω and in case Ω is infinite it also depends on whether one uses the restricted or unrestricted wreath product. However, in literature the notation used may be deficient and one needs to pay attention to the circumstances.

* In literature &quot;A&quot;≀Ω&quot;H&quot; may stand for the unrestricted wreath product &quot;A&quot; WrΩ &quot;H&quot; or the restricted wreath product &quot;A&quot; wrΩ &quot;H&quot;.
* Similarly, &quot;A&quot;≀&quot;H&quot; may stand for the unrestricted regular wreath product &quot;A&quot; Wr &quot;H&quot; or the restricted regular wreath product &quot;A&quot; wr &quot;H&quot;.
* In literature the &quot;H&quot;-set Ω may be omitted from the notation even if Ω ≠ &quot;H&quot;.
* In the special case that &quot;H&quot; = &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the symmetric group of degree &quot;n&quot; it is common in the literature to assume that Ω = {1...,&quot;n&quot;} (with the natural action of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;) and then omit Ω from the notation. That is, &quot;A&quot;≀&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; commonly denotes &quot;A&quot;≀{1...,&quot;n&quot;}&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; instead of the regular wreath product &quot;A&quot;≀&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;. In the first case the base group is the product of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;A&quot;, in the latter it is the product of &quot;n&quot;! copies of &quot;A&quot;.

== Properties ==

=== Agreement of unrestricted and restricted wreath product on finite Ω ===
Since the finite direct product is the same as the finite direct sum of groups, it follows that the unrestricted &quot;A&quot; WrΩ &quot;H&quot; and the restricted wreath product &quot;A&quot; wrΩ &quot;H&quot; agree if Ω is finite. In particular this is true when Ω = &quot;H&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is finite.

=== Subgroup ===
&quot;A&quot; wrΩ &quot;H&quot; is always a subgroup of &quot;A&quot; WrΩ &quot;H&quot;.

=== Cardinality ===
If &quot;A&quot;, &quot;H&quot; and Ω are finite, then
:: |&quot;A&quot;≀Ω&quot;H&quot;| = |&quot;A&quot;||Ω||&quot;H&quot;|.

=== Universal embedding theorem ===

&quot;Universal embedding theorem&quot;: If &quot;G&quot; is an extension of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;H&quot;, then there exists a subgroup of the unrestricted wreath product &quot;A&quot;≀&quot;H&quot; which is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;. This is also known as the &quot;Krasner–Kaloujnine embedding theorem&quot;. The Krohn–Rhodes theorem involves what is basically the semigroup equivalent of this.

== Canonical actions of wreath products ==

If the group &quot;A&quot; acts on a set Λ then there are two canonical ways to construct sets from Ω and Λ on which &quot;A&quot; WrΩ &quot;H&quot; (and therefore also &quot;A&quot; wrΩ &quot;H&quot;) can act.

* The imprimitive wreath product action on Λ × Ω.
*: If and , then
*:: formula_45
* The primitive wreath product action on ΛΩ.
*: An element in ΛΩ is a sequence (&quot;λ&quot;&quot;ω&quot;) indexed by the &quot;H&quot;-set Ω. Given an element its operation on (&quot;λ&quot;&quot;ω&quot;) ∈ ΛΩ is given by
*:: formula_46

== Examples ==

* The lamplighter group is the restricted wreath product formula_47.

* formula_48(the generalized symmetric group). The base of this wreath product is the &quot;n&quot;-fold direct product formula_49of copies of formula_50 where the action formula_51 of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; of degree &quot;n&quot; is given by &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;)(α1..., &quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot;) := (&quot;α&quot;&quot;σ&quot;(1)..., &quot;α&quot;&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)).

* formula_52(the hyperoctahedral group).
* The action of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; on {1...,&quot;n&quot;} is as above. Since the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;2 of degree 2 is isomorphic to formula_53 the hyperoctahedral group is a special case of a generalized symmetric group.

* The smallest non-trivial wreath product is formula_54, which is the two-dimensional case of the above hyperoctahedral group. It is the symmetry group of the square, also called &quot;D&quot;4, the dihedral group of order 8.
* Let &quot;p&quot; be a prime and let formula_55. Let &quot;P&quot; be a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Then &quot;P&quot; is isomorphic to the iterated regular wreath product formula_56 of &quot;n&quot; copies of formula_57. Here formula_58 and formula_59 for all formula_60. For instance, the Sylow 2-subgroup of S4 is the above formula_54 group.

* The Rubik&#x27;s Cube group is a normal subgroup of index 12 in the product of wreath products, formula_62, the factors corresponding to the symmetries of the 8 corners and 12 edges.

* The Sudoku validity-preserving transformations (VPT) group contains the double wreath product (&quot;S&quot;3 ≀ &quot;S&quot;3) ≀ &quot;S&quot;2, where the factors are the permutation of rows/columns within a 3-row or 3-column &quot;band&quot; or &quot;stack&quot; (&quot;S&quot;3), the permutation of the bands/stacks themselves (&quot;S&quot;3) and the transposition, which interchanges the bands and stacks (&quot;S&quot;2). Here, the index sets &quot;Ω&quot; are the set of bands (resp. stacks) (|&quot;Ω&quot;| = 3) and the set {bands, stacks} (|&quot;Ω&quot;| = 2). Accordingly, |&quot;S&quot;3 ≀ &quot;S&quot;3| = |&quot;S&quot;3|3|&quot;S&quot;3| = (3!)4 and |(&quot;S&quot;3 ≀ &quot;S&quot;3) ≀ &quot;S&quot;2| = |&quot;S&quot;3 ≀ &quot;S&quot;3|2|&quot;S&quot;2| = (3!)8 × 2.

*Wreath products arise naturally in the symmetries of complete rooted trees and their graphs. For example, the repeated (iterated) wreath product &quot;S&quot;2 ≀ &quot;S&quot;2 ≀ &quot;...&quot; ≀ &quot;S&quot;2 is the automorphism group of a complete binary tree.

<text>Florence of Worcester (; died 1118) was a monk of Worcester, who played some part in the production of the &quot;Chronicon ex chronicis&quot;, a Latin world chronicle which begins with the creation and ends in 1140.

The nature and extent of his contributions remain unclear. The usual starting point for an examination of his career is the notice of his death in the final entry for the year 1118 in the &quot;Chronicon&quot;:
Earlier generations of scholars took this to mean that Florence was the principal author of the chronicle for the entries before 1118, an assumption which led to its being commonly referred to as the &#x27;Chronicle of Florence (of Worcester)&#x27;.

However, it is now recognised that the work as it survives today was authored by John, a fellow monk at Worcester, whose signature is found in two later entries (1128 and 1138). He was found working on it at the behest of Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester (d. 1095), when the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis visited Worcester sometime in the early twelfth century.

Historians have formulated two main arguments against the ascription to Florence and in favour of that to John. First, there is no stylistic break in the &quot;Chronicon&quot; after Florence&#x27;s death, which gives the impression that a single author was responsible for the entire work. Second, certain sections before 1118 have been shown to make use of Eadmer&#x27;s &quot;Historia novorum&quot;, which was not completed before 1121 to 1124.

That said, the debt to Florence acknowledged by John in the entry for 1118 is considerable. One possibility if ultimately unverifiable is that Florence&#x27;s contribution lay in assembling the source materials which John consulted for the entries covering the period between the ninth and eleventh century. A precedent for such a task commissioned by Bishop Wulfstan is the compilation and production of a cartulary, called &quot;Hemming&#x27;s Cartulary&quot;, by the monk Hemming. Since nearly half a century lies between Wulfstan&#x27;s death (1095) and John&#x27;s final entry (1140), historian Simon Keynes has offered the tentative suggestion that Florence may have been the monk first commissioned by Wulfstan to compile material for a world chronicle and that John continued the task. According to the historian Nick Higham, William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester probably both followed a lost text of Florence.

The names of Hemming, Florence and John are found together in the Durham &quot;Liber Vitae&quot;, a confraternity book listing the names of benefactors of and visitors to the episcopal church of Durham (and its predecessor houses). The relevant section is a list of monks of St Mary&#x27;s (the cathedral chapter) at Worcester, which was entered during the time when Samson was bishop of Worcester (1096–1112).

Florence is also the first monk to be commemorated in a so-called &quot;titulus&quot; for Worcester, preserved on a mortuary roll belonging to Vitalis (d. 1122), abbot of Savigny.

<doc id="146630" wikidata="Q902488" url="?curid=146630" title="Monolayer">
<text>A monolayer is a single, closely packed layer of entities, commonly atoms or molecules. 
Monolayers can also be made out of cells.
&quot;Self-assembled monolayers&quot; form spontaneously on surfaces.
Monolayers of layered crystals like graphene and molybdenum disulfide are generally called &quot;2D materials&quot;.

== Types ==

A Langmuir monolayer or &quot;insoluble monolayer&quot; is a one-molecule thick layer of an insoluble organic material spread onto an aqueous subphase in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. Traditional compounds used to prepare Langmuir monolayers are amphiphilic materials that possess a hydrophilic headgroup and a hydrophobic tail. Since the 1980s a large number of other materials have been employed to produce Langmuir monolayers, some of which are semi-amphiphilic, including polymeric, ceramic or metallic nanoparticles and macromolecules such as polymers. Langmuir monolayers are extensively studied for the fabrication of Langmuir-Blodgett film (LB films), which are formed by transferred monolayers on a solid substrate.

A Gibbs monolayer or &quot;soluble monolayer&quot; is a monolayer formed by a compound that is soluble in one of the phases separated by the interface on which the monolayer is formed.

== Properties ==
=== Formation time ===
The monolayer formation time or monolayer time is the length of time required, on average, for a surface to be covered by an adsorbate, such as oxygen sticking to fresh aluminum. If the adsorbate has a unity sticking coefficient, so that every molecule which reaches the surface sticks to it without re-evaporating, then the monolayer time is very roughly:
:formula_1
where &quot;t&quot; is the time and &quot;P&quot; is the pressure. It takes about 1 second for a surface to be covered at a pressure of 300 μPa (2×10−6 Torr).

=== Monolayer phases and equations of state ===

A Langmuir monolayer can be compressed or expanded by modifying its area with a moving barrier in a Langmuir film balance. If the surface tension of the interface is measured during the compression, a &quot;compression isotherm&quot; is obtained. This isotherm shows the variation of surface pressure (formula_2, where formula_3 is the surface tension of the interface before the monolayer is formed) with the area (the inverse of surface concentration formula_4). It is analogous with a 3D process in which pressure varies with volume.

A variety of bidimensional phases can be detected, each separated by a phase transition. During the phase transition, the surface pressure doesn&#x27;t change, but the area does, just like during normal phase transitions volume changes but pressure doesn&#x27;t.
The 2D phases, in increasing pressure order:
* Bidimensional gas: there are few molecules per area unit, and they have few interactions, therefore, analogous of the equations of state for 3D gases can be used: ideal gas law formula_5, where formula_6 is the area per mole. As the surface pressure increases, more complex equations are needed (Van der Waals, virial...)
* Expanded liquid
* Compressed liquid
* Solid

If the area is further reduced once the solid phase has been reached, collapse occurs, the monolayer breaks and soluble aggregates and multilayers are formed

Gibbs monolayers also follow equations of state, which can be deduced from Gibbs isotherm.
* For very dilute solutions formula_7, through Gibbs isotherm another analogous of ideal gas law is reached formula_8
* For more concentrated solutions and applying Langmuir isotherm formula_9, thus formula_10

== Applications ==
Monolayers have a multitude of applications both at the air-water and at air-solid interphases.

Nanoparticle monolayers can be used to create functional surfaces that have for instance anti-reflective or superhydrophobic properties.

Monolayers are frequently encountered in biology. A micelle is a monolayer, and the phospholipid lipid bilayer structure of biological membranes is technically two monolayers. Langmuir monolayers are commonly used to mimic cell membrane to study the effects of pharmaceuticals or toxins.

== Cell culture ==
In cell culture, a monolayer refers to a layer of cells in which no cell is growing on top of another, but all are growing side by side and often touching each other on the same growth surface.

<doc id="146631" wikidata="Q3293447" url="?curid=146631" title="JOHNNIAC">
<text>The JOHNNIAC was an early computer built by the RAND Corporation (not Remington Rand, maker of the contemporaneous UNIVAC I computer) and based on the von Neumann architecture that had been pioneered on the IAS machine. It was named in honor of von Neumann, short for &quot;[[JOHNNIAC|John]] von Neumann Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer&quot;.

After being rescued from the scrap heap twice, the machine is currently at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.

Like the IAS machine, JOHNNIAC used 40-bit words, and included 1024 words of Selectron tube main memory, each holding 256 bits of data. Two instructions were stored in every word in 20-bit subwords consisting of an 8-bit instruction and a 12-bit address, the instructions being operated in series with the left subword running first. The initial machine had 83 instructions. A single register, named &quot;A&quot;, supplied an accumulator and the machine also featured a register named &quot;Q&quot;, for quotient. There was only one test condition, whether or not the high bit of the A register was set. There were no index registers, and as addresses were stored in the instructions, loops had to be implemented by modifying the instructions as the program ran. Since the machine only had 10 bits of address space, two of the address bits were unused and were sometimes used for data storage by interleaving data through the instructions.

JOHNNIAC weighed .

Numerous modifications were made to the system over its lifetime. In March 1955, 4096 words of magnetic-core memory were added to the system, replacing the earlier Selectrons. This required all 12 bits of addressing, and caused programs that stored data in the &quot;spare bits&quot; to fail. Later in 1955 a 12k-word drum memory secondary storage system was added as well. A transistor-based adder replaced the original tube-based adder in 1956. Numerous changes were made to the input/output peripherals as well, and in 1964, a real-time clock was added to support time-sharing.

One JOHNNIAC legacy was the JOSS programming language (the &quot;JOHNNIAC Open Shop System&quot;), an easy-to-use language which catered to novices. JOSS was an ancestor of DEC&#x27;s FOCAL and of MUMPS.

The CYCLONE at Iowa State University was a direct clone of JOHNNIAC, and was instruction compatible with it; the ILLIAC I at the University of Illinois may have been as well. Cyclone was later updated to include hardware for floating-point arithmetic.

<text>Marianus Scotus (1028–1082 or 1083) was an Irish monk and chronicler. He authored the &quot;Chronica Clara&quot;, a history of the world.

==Name==
Marianus Scotus is Latin for &quot;Marian the Scot&quot;, although that term at the time was still inclusive of the Irish. He is sometimes known as to distinguish him from Marianus Scotus of Regensburg and sometimes called (Modern ), &quot;Brigit&#x27;s Servant&quot;. The name &quot;Marianus&quot; (&#x27;devotee of Mary&#x27;) was doubtless given on the occasion of his becoming a monk on the Continent.

==Life==
An Irishman by birth, he was educated by a certain Tigernach and, having become a monk in 1052, he travelled to Germany, on the continental mainland, in 1056, and his subsequent life was passed in the abbeys of St Martin at Cologne and of Fulda, and at Mainz. He died in Mainz on 22 December 1082 or 1083, and was buried in Mainz Cathedral.

==Works==
Marianus wrote a &quot;Clear Chronicle&quot; (), which purports to be a universal history from the creation of the world to 1082 and which employed a dual numbering scheme on the misunderstanding that the Christian era computed by Dionysius Exiguus had been mistaken by 22 years. The chronicle was very popular during the Middle Ages and, in England, was extensively used by John of Worcester and other writers. It was first printed at Basel in 1559 and has been edited with an introduction by Georg Waitz for the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores&quot;, Vol. V.
Codex Palatino-Vaticanus 830 contains the Tripartite Chronicle of Marianus Scotus.

<text>A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is a type of steam-powered vessel, typically ocean-faring and seaworthy, that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move (turn) propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 19th century; however, there were exceptions that came before. Steamships usually use the prefix designations of &quot;PS&quot; for &quot;paddle steamer&quot; or &quot;SS&quot; for &quot;screw steamer&quot; (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, &quot;SS&quot; is incorrectly assumed by many to stand for &quot;steamship&quot;. Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as &quot;MV&quot; for &quot;motor vessel&quot;, so it is not correct to use &quot;SS&quot; for most modern vessels.

As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns, new trade routes opened up. The steamship has been described as a &quot;major driver of the first wave of trade globalization (1870–1913)&quot; and contributor to &quot;an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history&quot;.

== History ==
Steamships were preceded by smaller vessels, called steamboats, conceived in the first half of the 18th century by Denis Papin, with the first working steamboat and paddle steamer, the &quot;Pyroscaphe&quot;, from 1783. Once the technology of steam was mastered at this level, steam engines were mounted on larger, and eventually, ocean-going vessels. Becoming reliable, and propelled by screw rather than paddlewheels, the technology changed the design of ships for faster, more economic propulsion.

Paddlewheels as the main motive source became standard on these early vessels. It was an effective means of propulsion under ideal conditions but otherwise had serious drawbacks. The paddle-wheel performed best when it operated at a certain depth, however when the depth of the ship changed from added weight it further submerged the paddle wheel causing a substantial decrease in performance.

Within a few decades of the development of the river and canal steamboat, the first steamships began to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The first sea-going steamboat was Richard Wright&#x27;s first steamboat &quot;Experiment&quot;, an ex-French lugger; she steamed from Leeds to Yarmouth in July 1813.

The first iron steamship to go to sea was the 116-ton &quot;Aaron Manby&quot;, built in 1821 by Aaron Manby at the Horseley Ironworks, and became the first iron-built vessel to put to sea when she crossed the English Channel in 1822, arriving in Paris on 22 June. She carried passengers and freight to Paris in 1822 at an average speed of 8 knots (9 mph, 14 km/h).

The American ship first crossed the Atlantic Ocean arriving in Liverpool, England, on June 20, 1819, although most of the voyage was actually made under sail. The first ship to make the transatlantic trip substantially under steam power may have been the British-built Dutch-owned &quot;Curaçao&quot;, a wooden 438-ton vessel built in Dover and powered by two 50 hp engines, which crossed from Hellevoetsluis, near Rotterdam on 26 April 1827 to Paramaribo, Surinam on 24 May, spending 11 days under steam on the way out and more on the return. Another claimant is the Canadian ship in 1833.

The first steamship purpose-built for regularly scheduled trans-Atlantic crossings was the British side-wheel paddle steamer built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1838, which inaugurated the era of the trans-Atlantic ocean liner.

, built in Britain in 1839 by Francis Pettit Smith, was the world&#x27;s first screw propeller-driven steamship for open water seagoing. She had considerable influence on ship development, encouraging the adoption of screw propulsion by the Royal Navy, in addition to her influence on commercial vessels. The first screw-driven propeller steamship introduced in America was on a ship built by Thomas Clyde in 1844 and many more ships and routes followed.

==Screw-propeller steamers==


The key innovation that made ocean-going steamers viable was the change from the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller as the mechanism of propulsion. These steamships quickly became more popular, because the propeller&#x27;s efficiency was consistent regardless of the depth at which it operated. Being smaller in size and mass and being completely submerged, it was also far less prone to damage.

James Watt of Scotland is widely given credit for applying the first screw propeller to an engine at his Birmingham works, an early steam engine, beginning the use of a hydrodynamic screw for propulsion.

The development of screw propulsion relied on the following technological innovations.

Steam engines had to be designed with the power delivered at the bottom of the machinery, to give direct drive to the propeller shaft. A paddle steamer&#x27;s engines drive a shaft that is positioned above the waterline, with the cylinders positioned below the shaft. used chain drive to transmit power from a paddler&#x27;s engine to the propeller shaft – the result of a late design change to propeller propulsion.

An effective stern tube and associated bearings were required. The stern tube contains the propeller shaft where it passes through the hull structure. It should provide an unrestricted delivery of power by the propeller shaft. The combination of hull and stern tube must avoid any flexing that will bend the shaft or cause uneven wear. The inboard end has a stuffing box that prevents water from entering the hull along the tube. Some early stern tubes were made of brass and operated as a water lubricated bearing along the entire length. In other instances a long bush of soft metal was fitted in the after end of the stern tube. had this arrangement fail on her first transatlantic voyage, with very large amounts of uneven wear. The problem was solved with a lignum vitae water-lubricated bearing, patented in 1858. This became standard practice and is in use today.

Since the motive power of screw propulsion is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing is needed to transfer that load to the hull without excessive friction. had a 2 ft diameter gunmetal plate on the forward end of the shaft which bore against a steel plate attached to the engine beds. Water at 200 psi was injected between these two surfaces to lubricate and separate them. This arrangement was not sufficient for higher engine powers and oil lubricated &quot;collar&quot; thrust bearings became standard from the early 1850s. This was superseded at the beginning of the 20th century by floating pad bearing which automatically built up wedges of oil which could withstand bearing pressures of 500 psi or more.

==Name prefix==
Steam-powered ships were named with a prefix designating their propeller configuration i.e. single, twin, triple-screw. Single-screw Steamship SS, Twin-Screw Steamship TSS, Triple-Screw Steamship TrSS. Steam turbine-driven ships had the prefix TS. In the UK the prefix RMS for Royal Mail Steamship overruled the screw configuration prefix.

==First ocean-going steamships==
The first steamship credited with crossing the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe was the American ship , though she was actually a hybrid between a steamship and a sailing ship, with the first half of the journey making use of the steam engine. &quot;Savannah&quot; left the port of Savannah, Georgia, US, on 22 May 1819, arriving in Liverpool, England, on 20 June 1819; her steam engine having been in use for part of the time on 18 days (estimates vary from 8 to 80 hours). A claimant to the title of the first ship to make the transatlantic trip substantially under steam power is the British-built Dutch-owned &quot;Curaçao&quot;, a wooden 438-ton vessel built in Dover and powered by two 50 hp engines, which crossed from Hellevoetsluis, near Rotterdam on 26 April 1827 to Paramaribo, Surinam on 24 May, spending 11 days under steam on the way out and more on the return. Another claimant is the Canadian ship in 1833.

The British side-wheel paddle steamer was the first steamship purpose-built for regularly scheduled trans-Atlantic crossings, starting in 1838. In 1836 Isambard Kingdom Brunel and a group of Bristol investors formed the Great Western Steamship Company to build a line of steamships for the Bristol-New York route. The idea of regular scheduled transatlantic service was under discussion by several groups and the rival British and American Steam Navigation Company was established at the same time. &quot;Great Western&#x27;s&quot; design sparked controversy from critics that contended that she was too big. The principle that Brunel understood was that the carrying capacity of a hull increases as the cube of its dimensions, while water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This meant that large ships were more fuel efficient, something very important for long voyages across the Atlantic.

&quot;Great Western&quot; was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, with four masts to hoist the auxiliary sails. The sails were not just to provide auxiliary propulsion, but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship on an even keel and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American&#x27;s &quot;British Queen&quot; went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson &amp; Mercer in Bristol, &quot;Great Western&quot; was launched on 19 July 1837 and then sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons &amp; Field, producing 750 indicated horsepower between them. The ship proved satisfactory in service and initiated the transatlantic route, acting as a model for all following Atlantic paddle-steamers.

The Cunard Line&#x27;s began her first regular passenger and cargo service by a steamship in 1840, sailing from Liverpool to Boston.

In 1845 the revolutionary , also built by Brunel, became the first iron-hulled screw-driven ship to cross the Atlantic. SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; was the first ship to combine these two innovations. After the initial success of its first liner, of 1838, the Great Western Steamship Company assembled the same engineering team that had collaborated so successfully before. This time however, Brunel, whose reputation was at its height, came to assert overall control over design of the ship—a state of affairs that would have far-reaching consequences for the company. Construction was carried out in a specially adapted dry dock in Bristol, England.
Brunel was given a chance to inspect John Laird&#x27;s (English) channel packet ship &quot;Rainbow&quot;—the largest iron-hulled ship then in service—in 1838, and was soon converted to iron-hulled technology. He scrapped his plans to build a wooden ship and persuaded the company directors to build an iron-hulled ship. Iron&#x27;s advantages included being much cheaper than wood, not being subject to dry rot or woodworm, and its much greater structural strength. The practical limit on the length of a wooden-hulled ship is about 300 feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater.

In the spring of 1840 Brunel also had the opportunity to inspect , the first screw-propelled steamship, completed only a few months before by F. P. Smith&#x27;s Propeller Steamship Company. Brunel had been looking into methods of improving the performance of &quot;Great Britain&quot;″s paddlewheels, and took an immediate interest in the new technology, and Smith, sensing a prestigious new customer for his own company, agreed to lend &quot;Archimedes&quot; to Brunel for extended tests. Over several months, Smith and Brunel tested a number of different propellers on &quot;Archimedes&quot; in order to find the most efficient design, a four-bladed model submitted by Smith. When launched in 1843, &quot;Great Britain&quot; was by far the largest vessel afloat.

Brunel&#x27;s last major project, , was built in 1854–1857 with the intent of linking Great Britain with India, via the Cape of Good Hope, without any coaling stops. This ship was arguably more revolutionary than her predecessors. She was one of the first ships to be built with a double hull with watertight compartments and was the first liner to have four funnels. She was the biggest liner throughout the rest of the 19th century with a gross tonnage of almost 20,000 tons and had a passenger-carrying capacity of thousands. The ship was ahead of her time and went through a turbulent history, never being put to her intended use. The first transatlantic steamer built of steel was , built by Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers and entering service in 1879.

The first regular steamship service from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States began on 28 February 1849, with the arrival of in San Francisco Bay. The &quot;California&quot; left New York Harbor on 6  October 1848, rounded Cape Horn at the tip of South America, and arrived at San Francisco, California, after a four-month and 21-day journey. The first steamship to operate on the Pacific Ocean was the paddle steamer &quot;Beaver&quot;, launched in 1836 to service Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading posts between Puget Sound Washington and Alaska.

==Long-distance commercial steamships==
The most testing route for steam was from Britain or the East Coast of the U.S. to the Far East. The distance from either is roughly the same, between , traveling down the Atlantic, around the southern tip of Africa, and across the Indian Ocean. Before 1866, no steamship could carry enough coal to make this voyage and have enough space left to carry a commercial cargo.

A partial solution to this problem was adopted by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O), using an overland section between Alexandria and Suez, with connecting steamship routes along the Mediterranean and then through the Red Sea. While this worked for passengers and some high value cargo, sail was still the only solution for virtually all trade between China and Western Europe or East Coast America. Most notable of these cargoes was tea, typically carried in clippers.

Another partial solution was the Steam Auxiliary Ship – a vessel with a steam engine, but also rigged as a sailing vessel. The steam engine would only be used when conditions were unsuitable for sailing – in light or contrary winds. Some of this type (for instance &quot;Erl King&quot;) were built with propellers that could be lifted clear of the water to reduce drag when under sail power alone. These ships struggled to be successful on the route to China, as the standing rigging required when sailing was a handicap when steaming into a head wind, most notably against the southwest monsoon when returning with a cargo of new tea. Though the auxiliary steamers persisted in competing in far eastern trade for a few years (and it was &quot;Erl King&quot; that carried the first cargo of tea through the Suez Canal), they soon moved on to other routes.

What was needed was a big improvement in fuel efficiency. While the boilers for steam engines on land were allowed to run at high pressures, the Board of Trade (under the authority of the Merchant Shipping Act 1854) would not allow ships to exceed . Compound engines were a known source of improved efficiency – but generally not used at sea due to the low pressures available. &quot;Carnatic&quot; (1863), a P&amp;O ship, had a compound engine – and achieved better efficiency than other ships of the time. Her boilers ran at but relied on a substantial amount of superheat.

Alfred Holt, who had entered marine engineering and ship management after an apprenticeship in railway engineering, experimented with boiler pressures of in &quot;Cleator&quot;. Holt was able to persuade the Board of Trade to allow these boiler pressures and, in partnership with his brother Phillip launched &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in 1865. Holt had designed a particularly compact compound engine and taken great care with the hull design, producing a light, strong, easily driven hull. 

The efficiency of Holt&#x27;s package of boiler pressure, compound engine and hull design gave a ship that could steam at 10 knots on 20 long tons of coal a day. This fuel consumption was a saving from between 23 and 14 long tons a day, compared to other contemporary steamers. Not only did less coal need to be carried to travel a given distance, but fewer firemen were needed to fuel the boilers, so crew costs and their accommodation space were reduced. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was able to sail from London to China with a coaling stop at Mauritius on the outward and return journey, with a time on passage substantially less than the competing sailing vessels. Holt had already ordered two sister ships to &quot;Agamemnon&quot; by the time she had returned from her first trip to China in 1866, operating these ships in the newly formed Blue Funnel Line. His competitors rapidly copied his ideas for their own new ships.

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 gave a distance saving of about on the route from China to London. The canal was not a practical option for sailing vessels, as using a tug was difficult and expensive – so this distance saving was not available to them. Steamships immediately made use of this new waterway and found themselves in high demand in China for the start of the 1870 tea season. The steamships were able to obtain a much higher rate of freight than sailing ships and the insurance premium for the cargo was less. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.

==Triple expansion engines==
Throughout the 1870s, compound-engined steamships and sailing vessels coexisted in an economic equilibrium: the operating costs of steamships were still too high in certain trades, so sail was the only commercial option in many situations. The compound engine, where steam was expanded twice in two separate cylinders, still had inefficiencies. The solution was the triple expansion engine, in which steam was successively expanded in a high pressure, intermediate pressure and a low pressure cylinder.

The theory of this was established in the 1850s by John Elder, but it was clear that triple expansion engines needed steam at, by the standards of the day, very high pressures. The existing boiler technology could not deliver this. Wrought iron could not provide the strength for the higher pressures. Steel became available in larger quantities in the 1870s, but the quality was variable. The overall design of boilers was improved in the early 1860s, with the Scotch-type boilers – but at that date these still ran at the lower pressures that were then current.

The first ship fitted with triple expansion engines was &quot;Propontis&quot; (launched in 1874). She was fitted with boilers that operated at – but these had technical problems and had to be replaced with ones that ran at . This substantially degraded performance.

There were a few further experiments until went into service on the route from Britain to Australia. Her triple expansion engine was designed by Dr A C Kirk, the engineer who had developed the machinery for &quot;Propontis&quot;. The difference was the use of two double ended Scotch type steel boilers, running at . These boilers had patent corrugated furnaces that overcame the competing problems of heat transfer and sufficient strength to deal with the boiler pressure. &quot;Aberdeen&quot; was a marked success, achieving in trials, at 1,800 indicated horsepower, a fuel consumption of of coal per indicated horsepower. This was a reduction in fuel consumption of about 60%, compared to a typical steamer built ten years earlier. In service, this translated into less than 40 tons of coal a day when travelling at . Her maiden outward voyage to Melbourne took 42 days, with one coaling stop, carrying 4,000 tons of cargo.

Other similar ships were rapidly brought into service over the next few years. By 1885 the usual boiler pressure was and virtually all ocean-going steamships being built were ordered with triple expansion engines. Within a few years, new installations were running at . The tramp steamers that operated at the end of the 1880s could sail at with a fuel consumption of of coal per ton mile travelled. This level of efficiency meant that steamships could now operate as the primary method of maritime transport in the vast majority of commercial situations. In 1890, steamers constituted 57% of world&#x27;s tonnage, and by World War I their share raised to 93%.

==Era of the ocean liner==

By 1870 a number of inventions such as the screw propeller, the compound engine, and the triple-expansion engine made trans-oceanic shipping on a large scale economically viable. In 1870 the White Star Line’s set a new standard for ocean travel by having its first-class cabins amidships, with the added amenity of large portholes, electricity and running water. The size of ocean liners increased from 1880 to meet the needs of the human migration to the United States and Australia.

 and her sister ship were the last two Cunard liners of the period to be fitted with auxiliary sails. Both ships were built by John Elder &amp; Co. of Glasgow, Scotland, in 1884. They were record breakers by the standards of the time, and were the largest liners then in service, plying the Liverpool to New York route.

==1900–present ==

After the demonstration by British engineer Charles Parsons of his steam turbine-driven yacht, &quot;Turbinia&quot;, in 1897, the use of steam turbines for propulsion quickly spread. The Cunard RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot;, built in 1906 was one of the first ocean liners to use the steam turbine (with a late design change shortly before her keel was laid down) and was soon followed by all subsequent liners.

 was the largest steamship in the world when she sank in 1912; a subsequent major sinking of a steamer was that of the , as an act of World War I.

Launched in 1938, was the largest passenger steamship ever built. Launched in 1969, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (QE2) was the last passenger steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a scheduled liner voyage before she was converted to diesels in 1986. The last major passenger ship built with steam turbines was the &quot;Fairsky&quot;, launched in 1984, later &quot;Atlantic Star&quot;, reportedly sold to Turkish shipbreakers in 2013.

Most luxury yachts at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries were steam driven (see luxury yacht; also Cox &amp; King yachts). Thomas Assheton Smith was an English aristocrat who forwarded the design of the steam yacht in conjunction with the Scottish marine engineer Robert Napier.

==Decline of the steamship==

By World War II, steamers still constituted 73% of world&#x27;s tonnage, and similar percentage remained in early 1950s. The decline of the steamship began soon thereafter. Many had been lost in the war, and marine diesel engines had finally matured as an economical and viable alternative to steam power. The diesel engine had far better thermal efficiency than the reciprocating steam engine, and was far easier to control. Diesel engines also required far less supervision and maintenance than steam engines, and as an internal combustion engine it did not need boilers or a water supply, therefore was more space efficient and cheaper to build.

The Liberty ships were the last major steamship class equipped with reciprocating engines. The last Victory ships had already been equipped with marine diesels, and diesel engines superseded both steamers and windjammers soon after World War Two. Most steamers were used up to their maximum economical life span, and no commercial ocean-going steamers with reciprocating engines have been built since the 1960s.

Most larger warships of the world&#x27;s navies were propelled by steam turbines burning bunker fuel in both World Wars, apart from obsolete ships with reciprocating machines from the turn of the century, and rare cases of usage of diesel engines in larger warships. Steam turbines burning fuel remained in warship construction until the end of the Cold War (eg. Russian aircraft carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;), because of needs of high power and speed, although from 1970s they were mostly replaced by gas turbines. Large naval vessels and submarines continue to be operated with steam turbines, using nuclear reactors to boil the water.
NS &quot;Savannah&quot;, was the first nuclear-powered cargo-passenger ship, and was built in the late 1950s as a demonstration project for the potential use of nuclear energy.

Thousands of Liberty Ships (powered by steam piston engines) and Victory Ships (powered by steam turbine engines) were built in World War II. A few of these survive as floating museums and sail occasionally: , , , , and .

A steam turbine ship can be either direct propulsion (the turbines, equipped with a reduction gear, rotate directly the propellers), or turboelectric (the turbines rotate electric generators, which in turn feed electric motors operating the propellers).

While steam turbine-driven merchant ships such as the &quot;Algol&quot;-class cargo ships (1972–1973), ALP Pacesetter-class container ships (1973–1974) and very large crude carriers were built until the 1970s, the use of steam for marine propulsion in the commercial market has declined dramatically due to the development of more efficient diesel engines. One notable exception are LNG carriers which use boil-off gas from the cargo tanks as fuel. However, even there the development of dual-fuel engines has pushed steam turbines into a niche market with about 10% market share in newbuildings in 2013. Lately, there has been some development in hybrid power plants where the steam turbine is used together with gas engines. As of August 2017 the newest class of Steam Turbine ships are the &quot;Seri Camellia&quot;-class LNG carriers built by Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) starting in 2016 and comprising five units.

Most steamships today are powered by steam turbines. Nuclear powered ships are basically steam turbine vessels. The boiler is heated, not by heat of combustion, but by the heat generated by nuclear reactor. Most atomic-powered ships today are either aircraft carriers or submarines.

<text>The Festa do Peão de Barretos (Portuguese for &quot;Cowboy Festival of Barretos&quot;) is a rodeo featuring bulls and horses. In Barretos, Brazil, hundreds such festivals are held throughout the year. The Festa do Peão is one of the most famous such festivals, and has become world-famous for its size. The festival is held every year in the São Paulo (state) city of Barretos, where it has traditionally been organized and promoted by the social club &quot;Os Independentes&quot; (&quot;The Independents&quot;). Barretos has the largest rodeo in the southern hemisphere, attracting around one million people every year. 

==History==
The festival has its origins in the transfer of cattle from pasturing in the nearby states of Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Mato Grosso to slaughterhouses in Barretos. The cowboys in the &quot;entourages&quot; that led the herds would meet in the afternoons and compete with each other to see who could ride the most spirited horses - the precursor to today&#x27;s competition. The more difficult tradition of riding bulls instead of horses was brought from the United States.

In 1955, in Barretos, a group of bachelors organized the first recorded Festa do Peão de Boiadeiro. Since that time the festival has become world-famous for its scale, and the high quality of cowboys, horses, and bulls. The festival takes place every August, coinciding with the anniversary of the founding of Barretos, August 25. It continues to be organized by The Independents.

2005 was the 50th annual Festa. Until 1984, the festivities took place in Paulo de Lima Park, in the center of Barretos, where memorable expositions of cattle took place during the 60s through the 80s. Since 1985 The Independents have held the event in a 110-hectare park with a stadium large enough to hold 35 thousand people, designed by renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.

During its history, the festival has brought to Brazil some great international superstars, such as Shakira, Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, Gloria Gaynor, A-Ha, Mariah Carey and Shania Twain. 

Twain&#x27;s concert was probably the festival&#x27;s most notable attraction to date, as Festa do Peão had been trying to negotiate a show with the singer for over 20 years, and agreed to pay a R$4 million fee for her to come to Brazil. The official announcement of her concert was made on the Festa do Peão page on February 26, 2018, and reached a mark of 1.3 million views on Facebook alone. One million people visited Parque do Peão on the weekend of the event. Brazilian late country star Marília Mendonça and pop singer Bastian Baker opened Twain&#x27;s concert, which started at midnight for an audience of 55,000. Media outlets in Brazil, such as G1, reviewed the concert as one of the best ever performed at the festival.

<doc id="146638" wikidata="Q10490" url="?curid=146638" title="Ayrton Senna">
<text>Ayrton Senna da Silva (; 21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Senna won three Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles with McLaren, and—at the time of his death—held the record for most pole positions (65), among others; he won 41 Grands Prix across 11 seasons.

Born and raised in São Paulo, Senna began competitive kart racing aged 13; his first go-kart was built by his father using a lawnmower engine. After twice finishing runner-up at the Karting World Championship, Senna progressed to Formula Ford in 1981, dominating the British and European championships in his debut seasons. He then won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship amidst a close title battle with Martin Brundle, further winning the Macau Grand Prix that year. Senna signed for Toleman in , making his Formula One debut at the . After scoring several podium finishes in his rookie season, Senna moved to Lotus in to replace Nigel Mansell, taking his maiden pole position and victory at the rain-affected , a feat he repeated in Belgium. He remained at Lotus for his and campaigns, scoring multiple wins in each and finishing third in the latter World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Senna signed for McLaren in to partner Alain Prost; together, they won 15 of 16 Grands Prix held that season—driving the Honda-powered MP4/4—with Senna taking his maiden championship by three points after winning a then-record eight Grands Prix. Their fierce rivalry culminated in title-deciding collisions at Suzuka in 1989 and 1990, despite Prost&#x27;s move to Ferrari in the latter, with Prost winning the former title and Senna taking the following. Senna took seven victories, including his home Grand Prix in Brazil, as he secured his third title in . The dominant Williams-Renault combination prevailed throughout his remaining two seasons at McLaren, with Senna achieving several race wins in each, including his record-breaking sixth victory in on his way to again finishing runner-up to Prost in the championship. Senna negotiated a move to Williams for his campaign, replacing the retired Prost to partner Damon Hill.

During the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, Senna died as a result of an accident whilst leading the race, driving the Williams FW16. His state funeral was attended by an estimated three million people. Following subsequent safety reforms, he was the last fatality in the Formula One World Championship until Jules Bianchi in 2015. Senna achieved 41 wins, 65 pole positions, 19 fastest laps and 80 podiums in Formula One; he remains a legendary figure within motorsport for his raw speed and aggressive driving style, and is frequently cited as a national hero of Brazil. He was also widely acclaimed for his wet-weather performances, such as at the 1984 Monaco, 1985 Portuguese and 1993 European Grands Prix. Senna was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2000.
==Early life==

Senna was born at 2:35 BRT on 21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighbourhood of São Paulo. The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Joanna Senna da Silva; he had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo. Senna was born of both Italian and Spanish heritage: his mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, and his father was born to a Spanish mother from Tíjola, Andalusia.

The house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to his maternal grandfather, João Senna, located less than from Campo de Marte, where his family operated the &quot;Aeronautics Material&quot; park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic—excelling in gymnastics and other sports—and developed an interest in cars and motor racing by the age of four. He had poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three; an electroencephalogram showed no abnormalities. Senna&#x27;s parents nicknamed him &quot;Beco&quot;. At the age of seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family&#x27;s farm and also how to change gears without using a clutch.

Senna attended the Colégio Rio Branco in the São Paulo neighbourhood of Higienópolis and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics, alongside other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. He later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months with an average grade of 68%.

==Junior racing career==
===Karting===
Senna&#x27;s first go-kart was built by his father, who operated an automotive factory, using a small 1 hp lawnmower engine. Senna started racing at Interlagos and entered his first kart racing competition at the age of 13. He started his debut race on pole position, against drivers who were several years older than him; he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with an opponent. His father supported him throughout his karting career, with Lucio Pascal Gascon becoming his manager.

Senna won the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He contested the Karting World Championship five times from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980. From 1978 to 1980, he was the teammate and rival of Terry Fullerton at DAP; their fierce rivalry saw several 1–2 finishes in major competitions. Senna later stated that Fullerton was the rival he got the most satisfaction racing against, owing to the lack of money and politics at that level, describing it as &quot;pure racing&quot;.

===Lower formulae===
In 1981, Senna moved to Eaton, a suburb of Norwich in England, to pursue an open-wheel racing career; he began his career in Formula Ford 1600, winning the British and Townsend Thoresen Championships that year with Van Diemen, amid a fractious rivalry with teammate Enrique Mansilla. Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport. 

At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil. Before leaving England, Senna was offered a drive with a two-litre Formula Ford team—Rushen Green Racing—for . Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As &quot;da Silva&quot; is the most common Brazilian surname, he adopted his maternal surname, &quot;Senna&quot;. For 1982, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool, dominating the British and European Championships, winning 15 of 17 races held at the former.

In 1983, Senna drove in the British Formula Three Championship for West Surrey Racing. He dominated the first half of the season until Martin Brundle, driving a similar car for Eddie Jordan Racing, closed the gap in the second part of the championship. Senna won the title at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, contentious battle with Brundle. In November that year, Senna also triumphed at the inaugural Macau Formula Three Grand Prix with the Toyota-powered Theodore Racing Team, owned by Teddy Yip. Senna was managed for most of his junior career by Armando Teixeira, who was assisted by Domingos Piedade.

==Formula One career==
===Toleman (1984)===
==== Rookie testing ====
Ahead of the 1984 season, Senna was linked to many Formula One teams but received very few offers he liked. He had previously declined a long-term contract from McLaren, and that door was formally closed when Alain Prost (unexpectedly fired by Renault after finishing runner-up in 1983) received the second McLaren seat. He was also linked to Lotus and Brabham, but both teams&#x27; title sponsors (Imperial Tobacco / John Player &amp; Sons for Lotus and Parmalat for Brabham) wanted drivers from their respective home countries, so Lotus retained Nigel Mansell and Brabham signed brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi. In addition, Brabham&#x27;s lead driver, Nelson Piquet, vetoed Senna from Brabham and arranged for the team to sign his friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver. Consequently, Senna joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive Pirelli tyres. He was paired with Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion.

In 1983, Senna tested for McLaren, Brabham, Williams, and Toleman, although Williams also lacked a vacancy. Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis observed that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Keke Rosberg) so that he would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car. During his test for Williams at Donington Park, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Rosberg, Williams&#x27;s reigning World Champion.

====Debut season====

Senna made his debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, where he qualified 17th but retired when the Hart 415T turbocharger failed on lap 8. He scored his first World Championship point when he finished sixth in his second race at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami with severe cramp in his neck and shoulders, and replicated that result two weeks later at the Belgian Grand Prix. A combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in his failure to qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix, the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at Imola due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli (Toleman were in the process of switching from Pirelli to Michelin). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.

Senna&#x27;s best result of the season came at the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing Niki Lauda for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader Alain Prost. Before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the Tyrrell-Ford of Stefan Bellof was catching both at the same rate, although he was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell).

Early on his career, Senna developed a reputation for providing very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry. This skill led Toleman&#x27;s Pat Symonds, Senna&#x27;s first Formula One race engineer, to regard the Dallas Grand Prix as the initial highlight of Senna&#x27;s debut season, instead of Monaco. In an interview, Symonds recalled:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race, but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish, but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said &quot;I&#x27;m sure that the wall moved!&quot; And even though I&#x27;ve heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn&#x27;t heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him after the race to have a look at the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit, the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.That season, Senna took two more podium finishes—third at the British and Portuguese Grands Prix—and placed 9th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 13 points overall. He did not take part in the Italian Grand Prix after he was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by entering talks with Lotus for 1985 without informing the Toleman team first. Although Senna did have a £100,000 buyout clause in his contract, the team had to be informed before discussions with another team started. Senna became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder Colin Chapman, who had died in 1982. 

Senna had some health issues during the season. Concerned about his low weight, he hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition. By the end of the year, Senna had developed Bell&#x27;s palsy, possibly from a virus. One side of his face had become completely paralysed; Sid Watkins gave Senna steroids to preserve the possibility of recovery.

===Lotus (1985–1987)===
====1985: First pole positions and wins====
Senna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis. He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend. Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience. At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from the Ferrari of Michele Alboreto, and lapping everyone up to and including third placed Patrick Tambay. The race was the first Grand Slam of Senna&#x27;s career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race. He later argued it was the best drive of his career, an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna&#x27;s &quot;truly special&quot; talent.

Senna led at the San Marino, Monaco, British and German Grands Prix but retired from all these races either from engine failure or running out of fuel, and he had a huge accident at the French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard&#x27;s fastest corner after an engine failure in the middle of the corner. He did not finish in the points again until coming second at the Austrian Grand Prix, despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. His determination to take pole at the Monaco Grand Prix had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, although the accusations continued in Canada when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time. Two more podiums followed in the Netherlands and Italy, before Senna added his second victory in wet-dry conditions, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. Senna&#x27;s relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian driver. Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points. In terms of qualifying, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field; his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers. Renault&#x27;s V6 qualifying engines were reported to be producing over .

====1986: Eight pole positions and eight podiums====
De Angelis was replaced at Lotus by Scotland&#x27;s Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team&#x27;s major sponsor John Player &amp; Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted &quot;It was bad, bad. Until then I had a good relationship with Derek.&quot; Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet&#x27;s teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races. Although the 98T was like the 97T which came before it, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season it saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver&#x27;s standings again, with a total of 55 points. The 1986 Formula One cars were the most powerful cars in history, with Senna&#x27;s 98T producing over in qualifying and in the race.

After winning the Detroit Grand Prix from Frenchmen Prost and Jacques Laffite⁠which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the 1986 FIFA World Cup by France⁠Senna asked a trackside supporter for the Brazilian flag and he drove one lap waving it. Thereafter, he repeated this ritual every time he won a race. During an interview on American television, he used English curse words to express his frustration at having to go into the pits earlier than expected due to a deflating rear tire. Senna also had a brief foray into rallying when he was invited by British magazine &quot;Cars &amp; Car Conversions&quot; to try out a Vauxhall Nova, an MG Metro 6R4, a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and a Ford Escort on a stretch of land closed to the public.

====1987: Last season at Lotus====
Team Lotus had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year&#x27;s Constructors&#x27; Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda. The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment. Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics. Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the angular Michigan street circuit, and the first ever for an active suspension Formula One car.

As the championship progressed, it became evident that the Williams cars had the advantage over the rest of the field, the gap between the Honda-engined teams made most obvious at the British Grand Prix, where Mansell and Piquet in the superior Williams cars lapped the Lotuses of Senna and Nakajima who finished 3rd and 4th respectively. Senna became dissatisfied with his chances at Lotus and at Monza it was announced that he would be joining McLaren for 1988. Senna was fined $15,000 for punching a corner marshal after they refused to push his stalled car in Mexico then finished the season strongly, coming second in the final two races in Japan and Australia; post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his Lotus to be wider than permitted by the rules and he was disqualified, bringing his last and most successful season with Lotus to a sour end. Senna was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, six podium finishes and only one pole position. This season marked a turning point in Senna&#x27;s career as, throughout the year, he built a deep relationship with Honda, which paid big dividends, as McLaren had secured Williams&#x27;s supply of Honda&#x27;s V6 turbo engines for 1988.

===McLaren (1988–1993)===
====1988: First world championship====
In 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren&#x27;s number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team. The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years. The experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton, and Lotus.

One notable incident of the year was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Senna out-qualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67. Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna was so distressed by his mistake that he went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. After team manager Jo Ramirez called him through his Monaco apartment&#x27;s cleaner hours after he had crashed, Senna was still devastated by his own mistake. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss Ron Dennis did not know what had caused his DNF until then, although Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portier, which pitched him into the outside guard rail.

At the Portuguese Grand Prix, Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna who, as he would a number of times, dived into the fast first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at . Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Prost, normally a calm individual, was angered by Senna&#x27;s manoeuvre, and the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the post-race team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident.

Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the dominant McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost&#x27;s seven. Although Prost scored more points over the season, three of his second places were dropped, as only the eleven-best scores counted, meaning that Senna bested Prost by three points. During the season, Senna rewrote the record books. His eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by Jim Clark () and Prost (1984). His 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).

The biggest incident of the year happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were closing in on the McLaren MP4/4 (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo chicane, Senna closed on the Williams FW12 of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap, and the two collided; Senna&#x27;s car was beached on top of a curb and had stalled. Ferrari went on to finish 1–2, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of the team&#x27;s founder Enzo Ferrari. This proved to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988. 

====1989: Runner-up to Alain Prost====
In , the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it. Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis declared that they found consistent differences between the Honda engines from Prost and Senna, to the detriment of Prost. Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, a move which Prost claimed violated a pre-race agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, although Prost&#x27;s story was backed up by John Hogan of the team&#x27;s major sponsor, Marlboro). A discussion between the two drivers and Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost&#x27;s personal animosity to Dennis and the team.

Senna took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, Monaco, and Mexico. Senna also led every lap of those races, a feat unequalled until Sebastian Vettel replicated it in . Senna also managed to win in Germany, Belgium, and Spain. Unreliability in four consecutive races in Phoenix, Canada, France, and Britain, and further unreliability in Italy, together with collisions in Brazil and Portugal, swung the title in Prost&#x27;s favour.

Prost took the 1989 world title after a collision with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the gurney flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna. This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost&#x27;s car faster on the straights, but slower through corners—a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the tight last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track.

A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in public criticism of the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made. Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place.

====1990: Second world championship====
In 1990, Prost left McLaren for Ferrari, burning bridges on his way out. He was replaced by the Austrian Gerhard Berger, who became Senna&#x27;s close friend.

Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds. Among his victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi&#x27;s Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. However, Prost mounted a fierce challenge and scored five wins that season, including a crucial victory in Spain where he and teammate Nigel Mansell finished 1–2 for the Scuderia. Senna had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to nine points with two races left.

At the penultimate round of the championship in Japan, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack, where the racing line was. He later claimed that the this agreement was not honored, possibly due to Balestre&#x27;s interference. In addition, as revealed by journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would not have been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. 

At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270 km/h (170 mph) and went off the track. Prost was out of the race, automatically making Senna world champion. Prost believed that Senna&#x27;s actions were intentional, as (based on Honda telemetry) Senna continued speeding up as the two went into the corner. He added that he considered retiring from the sport after the incident. However, Senna initially denied that he intentionally wrecked Prost. When pundit and former champion Jackie Stewart confronted him about his actions and brought up his history of on-track accidents and collisions, Senna feigned outrage, replying that &quot;if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver.&quot; 

One year later, Senna admitted that he intentionally wrecked Prost as payback for 1989, as well as his anger over the FIA&#x27;s decision to disqualify him in 1989 and its pole position ruling in 1990. He said it was not how he wanted it to be, but it was how it had to be. He later apologized to Stewart for his remarks in 1989, telling him that &quot;God won&#x27;t allow me to live this lie.&quot;

====1991: Youngest back-to-back and three-time world champion====
In , Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. 1991 was a difficult season for Senna, who publicly questioned the new Honda V12 engine&#x27;s competitiveness, suggesting that it was weaker than the last year&#x27;s V10. Prost&#x27;s Ferrari suffered a downturn in performance and was not competitive, but Nigel Mansell, now with Williams, was driving the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault.

Senna won the first four races in Phoenix, Brazil, Imola, and Monaco as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. Mansell scored only six points by the time Senna had 40 points. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320 km/h (200 mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.

Senna also got into several accidents and mishaps, including a jet-skiing accident before the Mexican Grand Prix; a crash in qualifying at that race at the fastest corner on the track; a retirement on the final lap of the British Grand Prix (Mansell eventually gave Senna a ride back to the pits during his victory lap); a testing accident at Hockenheim that sent Senna&#x27;s car 15 feet into the air and forced him to spend the night in the hospital; and a retirement at the German Grand Prix after running out of fuel.

To save the season, Senna demanded additional engine upgrades from Honda. These modifications, including modifications introduced at Hungary and variable inlet trumpets introduced at Belgium enabled him to make a late-season push. He won three more races to pull away from Mansell. Once again, Senna clinched the title in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win) went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season.

At the end of the season, Senna won his third consecutive &quot;Autosport&quot; International Racing Driver Award. At that year&#x27;s FISA gala dinner, he gave Balestre a helmet because of the sincere atmosphere and as an insulting psychological gesture.

====1992: Unsuccessful challenge to the Williams FW14B====
Senna considered moving to Williams for the 1992 season, but Honda&#x27;s CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty. In addition to Alain Prost&#x27;s recommendation, Honda had played an important part in bringing Senna with them to McLaren.

In 1992, Williams&#x27;s all-conquering FW14B car dominated the season. It boasted aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and a powerful Renault V10 engine, which was now more powerful than Honda&#x27;s. By contrast, the McLaren MP4/7A was beset by production delays and did not debut until round three. The team struggled to catch up to Williams&#x27; technological advantage, building a semi-automatic gearbox for the first time and trialing an active suspension system. The new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners. Honda left Formula One at the end of the season.

Senna won three races (Monaco, Hungary, and Italy) and finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton&#x27;s Michael Schumacher. During this time, relations between Senna and Schumacher grew testy. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Schumacher accused Senna of &quot;playing around&quot; while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with his engine, a fact that Schumacher was apparently unaware of at the time. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher collided with Senna, resulting in Senna&#x27;s retirement. Senna later confronted Schumacher, who admitted responsibility for the accident. At a test session for the German Grand Prix, Senna and Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with Senna grabbing Schumacher by the collar and accusing him of endangering him by blocking him on the track.

Senna grew increasingly worried about driver safety during the season. At round two in Mexico, he suffered a major crash during practice and temporarily wore a neck brace before the next day&#x27;s race. Various drivers, including Senna, criticized the poor condition of the circuit. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver Érik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. Senna could hear that the stricken car&#x27;s engine was revving at max RPM and could blow at any moment. Disregarding his own safety, he exited his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman. His actions were applauded and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image.

====1993: Final wins and last season at McLaren====

A free agent for , Senna offered to drive for Williams for free. However, Alain Prost, who still had ill will against his former teammate, had already joined the team conditional on not being paired with Senna. Senna publicly accused Prost of cowardice, although the racing press noted that in , Senna had done the same thing to Derek Warwick. Senna declined a drive from Ferrari, which eventually went to teammate Gerhard Berger. He reluctantly re-signed with McLaren on a race-by-race basis, and reportedly received a salary of $1 million per race.

Without Honda, McLaren was left with a customer supply of Ford engines, which were two specifications behind Benetton&#x27;s Ford works engines and 50-80 horsepower behind Renault. However, Senna was heartened by the McLaren MP4/8, which implemented technological upgrades, including an updated active suspension system. Senna asked to switch to the Chrysler-backed Lamborghini V12 engine in midseason, but Dennis stuck with Ford for the rest of the season after Ford delivered an upgrade at round 11 in Hungary.Despite Williams&#x27; superiority, Senna won three of the first six races. He finished second at the season opener in Kyalami. He won his second after Prost, who had been dominating the race, spun out in the rain; Senna&#x27;s pass on Damon Hill for the lead was described as &quot;the man at his most brilliant.&quot; The next race, the European Grand Prix at Donington Park, has been described as one of the greatest races in Senna&#x27;s career. In fast-changing and rainy conditions—Prost&#x27;s seven pit stops set a Formula One record—Senna overtook four drivers on the first lap and eventually lapped all but second place. He also won his record-breaking sixth win at round six in Monaco, breaking a tie with Graham Hill at five, after polesitter Prost was handed a ten-second stop-go penalty for jumping the start.

After Monaco, Senna unexpectedly found himself on top of the drivers&#x27; standings. However, he was only five points ahead of Prost. The Frenchman promptly pulled away with four straight victories. Senna&#x27;s season was hampered by mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal. Prost took his fourth world championship, with Senna as runner-up.In mid-October, Senna signed with Williams to replace the retiring Prost for 1994. However, at the following race, the , Senna got into a heated argument with Jordan&#x27;s Eddie Irvine (a backmarker who had tried to block Senna from lapping him) and eventually tried to punch Irvine in the head. He also turned down Prost&#x27;s suggestion of a conciliatory gesture. After deliberations, the FIA limited Senna&#x27;s punishment to a six-month suspended race ban (i.e., probation) for 1994, explaining that Irvine had provoked Senna on track and Senna had a &quot;very positive attitude&quot; with the tribunal. Senna&#x27;s minimal punishment received some criticism, as the FIA had been threatening to ban Prost for four races for criticizing the FIA. 

Senna took his 41st and last Formula One win at the . It was McLaren&#x27;s 104th win as a constructor, putting it ahead of Ferrari in the all-time constructor wins standings. Senna surprised the Formula One community by pulling Prost onto the top step of the podium to celebrate the Frenchman&#x27;s retirement.

===Williams (1994)===
With Prost out of the picture, Senna joined Williams for . He was reportedly paid a $20 million salary. Although Williams remained the premier team in Formula One for several more years, it was particularly affected by the FIA&#x27;s 1994 ban on electronic driver aids like active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control, and launch control. Senna said that he had a &quot;very negative feeling&quot; about the FW16. He added that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I&#x27;ll risk saying that we&#x27;ll be lucky if something really serious doesn&#x27;t happen.&quot; Before round three at Imola, Senna spoke with Ferrari&#x27;s Luca Cordero di Montezemolo about potentially moving to the Scuderia.

Senna was particularly upset by rumors that Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton B194 was still secretly using the electronic driver aids. Following his retirement at the , Senna stood near the first corner to watch the cars, hoping to detect evidence of cheating. According to teammate Damon Hill, Senna claimed that he heard &quot;unusual noises from the engine&quot; indicative of cheating.

Senna took pole at the first three races but retired from each of them. At Brazil, Schumacher took the race lead after passing Senna in the pits. Senna pushed hard to overtake Schumacher, but spun on lap 56, forcing a retirement. At the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna&#x27;s race was ended by a multi-car accident at the first corner, where Mika Häkkinen hit him from behind and Nicola Larini subsequently T-boned him. Schumacher won both races, giving him a 20-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Senna took pole again at Imola but fatally crashed during the race. Schumacher won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship and dedicated it to Senna.

==Death, state funeral and reaction==
===1994 San Marino Grand Prix===
The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994. The race was marked by a string of accidents suffered by Rubens Barrichello, Roland Ratzenberger, JJ Lehto, and Pedro Lamy, as well as Senna. Ratzenberger was killed by his crash, and Senna brought an Austrian flag with him for the race, which he presumably intended to raise in honor of Ratzenberger. Senna was heavily disturbed by the crashes. On the morning of the race, Senna spoke with the now-retired Alain Prost about re-establishing the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association to organize for driver safety. Senna confided to Prost that &quot;I&#x27;m not optimistic at all about this race.&quot;

On lap 7, Senna fatally crashed at the high-speed Tamburello corner. He was airlifted to Bologna&#x27;s Maggiore Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 18:40 CEST (16:40 GMT). The official time of death under Italian law was 14:17 CEST (12:17 GMT), the time of the crash. The hospital&#x27;s head of emergency medicine, Dr. Maria Teresa Fiandri, stated that Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries, and a ruptured temporal artery, any one of which would likely have killed him. Senna&#x27;s friend and &quot;Autosprint&quot;″s picture editor Angelo Orsi took photographs of Senna being treated on track, but out of respect, they have never been made officially public.

An analysis of the crash primarily focused on Senna&#x27;s steering column, which broke during the crash. The night before the race, Senna asked for the steering wheel to be shortened. There was no time to build a new steering column from scratch, so Williams welded together different parts to adjust the existing steering column. Following the race, six defendants—three senior Williams employees, the Formula One race director, the race organizer, and the Imola track director—were charged with manslaughter in Italian courts. The Williams defendants argued that the crash broke the steering column, while prosecutors argued that the column broke first and caused the crash. It was also charged that the Imola Circuit was in poor condition.

The defendants stood trial in 1997. Before the verdict, the prosecutor asked to drop the charges against everyone except Williams&#x27; Patrick Head and Adrian Newey, for whom he recommended suspended one-year sentences. Head and Newey were acquitted, and an appeals court upheld the acquittals in 1999. However, the Supreme Court of Cassation ordered a retrial to clarify facts about the steering column breakage and other potential causes of the accident. In 2005, a court found that the steering column was poorly modified and that its breakage on track caused Senna&#x27;s accident. Newey was acquitted, as he was not responsible for the modifications. Head was found culpable, but was protected from prosecution by the statute of limitations. He appealed anyway to clear his name, but his appeal was rejected in 2007.

===State funeral and burial===

Senna&#x27;s body was flown back to Brazil on 4 May 1994. He lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in São Paulo. His funeral took place the following day, 5 May. With over half a million visitors, it was the largest funeral procession in the city&#x27;s history. The Brazilian government declared three days of national mourning.

Senna was buried in the Morumbi Cemetery in São Paulo. His grave bears the epitaph &quot;Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus&quot; (Romans 8:38–39, &quot;Nothing can separate me from the love of God&quot;).

===Immediate reactions===
For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger. Throughout the rest of the 1994 season, Senna was commemorated in various ways. Damon Hill, along with Michael Schumacher, dedicated their individual success to Senna with Hill&#x27;s victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and Schumacher&#x27;s world-championship victory in the Australian Grand Prix.

At Honda&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters, so many floral tributes were received that they filled the large exhibition lobby, even though Honda no longer participated in Formula One. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near-mythic status.

In July 1994, the Brazil national football team dedicated their World Cup victory to Senna, and collectively held a banner with their dedication on the field after defeating Italy in the final, which read &quot;Senna... Aceleramos juntos, o tetra é nosso!&quot; (). Senna had met various members of the squad, including Ronaldo, as well as Leonardo Araújo, three months earlier in Paris, telling them &quot;this is our year&quot;.

==Other motorsport ventures==
Senna did not participate in many other forms of motorsport once he reached Formula One. He took part in the 1984 Nürburgring Race of Champions, an exhibition race where all drivers competed in identical examples of the then-new Mercedes 190E 2.3–16 with minor race modifications. The race was held on the then newly-opened Nürburgring Grand Prix track, before the European Grand Prix. Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula One drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme, and Alan Jones, driving identical touring cars. Alain Prost started from pole position. Senna, who was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi, took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning the race ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann. After the race, Senna was quoted as saying: &quot;Now I know I can do it.&quot;

Senna took part in the Nürburgring round of the 1984 World Sportscar Championship, driving a Porsche 956 for New-Man Joest Racing, alongside Henri Pescarolo and Stefan Johansson. He finished in 8th place but impressed the team and his co-drivers. He took part in the Masters of Paris-Bercy event in 1993, an indoor all-star kart racing competition held on a temporary circuit at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. The event notably hosted the final on-track duel between Senna and Prost.

Senna secured an IndyCar testing session with the support of compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi. In December 1992, Senna visited Firebird International Raceway in Chandler, Arizona, near Phoenix in the United States, in order to test a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART IndyCar. Unlike the more advanced Formula One cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo Chevrolet-Ilmor V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car; IndyCar teams were run with significantly smaller budgets than Formula One teams and did not have to make their own cars. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 Penske PC-22 at his disposal during this test session.

In a 2018 interview, Fittipaldi revealed that Penske boss Roger Penske was ready to enter a third car for Senna to drive at the 1993 Indianapolis 500, which is one of the most prestigious and important races in the world and a race that defending champion Mansell (who had left Formula One for CART) was competing at. When McLaren boss Ron Dennis found out it was a very serious deal he promptly banned Senna from competing at Indianapolis.

==Personal life==
===Religion and charitable work===
Senna was a devout Catholic, once saying: &quot;Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m immune. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m immortal.&quot; He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe. According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: &quot;On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.&quot;

Senna secretly donated millions of U.S. dollars to help poor children. Shortly before his death, he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became the Instituto Ayrton Senna (IAS). The IAS has invested nearly US$80 million over a twelve-year period in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, NGOs, and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals. The foundation is officially advised by Bernie Ecclestone, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger.

In a 1994 interview following Senna&#x27;s death, Frank Williams said that &quot;If you want a summary of Ayrton Senna ... he was actually a greater man out of the car than in it.&quot; 

===Family and relationships===
Senna married his childhood friend Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza in 1981, but she had difficulty adapting to her husband&#x27;s racing life in England and they divorced in 1982. Vasconcelos later said: &quot;I was his second passion. His first passion was racing.&quot; Although Senna did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father out of a sense of pride.

Senna&#x27;s nephew Bruno also became a Formula One driver, competing from 2010 to 2012. Senna praised Bruno&#x27;s talent, telling people in 1993 that &quot;If you think I&#x27;m fast, just wait until you see my nephew Bruno.&quot; Bruno temporarily quit racing to please his family after Senna&#x27;s death. In 2012, he raced for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family.

From 1985 to 1988, Senna dated—and was briefly engaged to—Adriane Yamin, the daughter of a São Paulo entrepreneur. At the start of the relationship, Yamin was 15. She was often chaperoned by her mother during dates.

In 1988, Nelson Piquet accused Senna of being homosexual in an incendiary interview, in which Piquet also called Enzo Ferrari &quot;senile&quot;, former teammate Nigel Mansell an &quot;uneducated blockhead&quot;, and Mansell&#x27;s wife &quot;ugly&quot;. Piquet retracted his comments after Senna and Mansell threatened to sue him for slander. Senna shot back in a 1990 interview with the Brazilian edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;, declaring that he lost his virginity at 13 years of age to a prostitute arranged by his cousin, and insinuating that Piquet loathed him because he had previously slept with Piquet&#x27;s future wife.

Following Piquet&#x27;s remarks, Senna was involved in a series of high-profile relationships, including with Brazilian singer and television star Xuxa from late 1988 until 1990. Senna also had an affair with American model Carol Alt, and briefly dated models Marjorie Andrade and Elle Macpherson. At the time of his death, Senna was in a relationship with Brazilian model—and, later, television personality—Adriane Galisteu. Six years after Senna&#x27;s death in 2000, model Edilaine de Barros filed a paternity suit against the Senna estate, but DNA testing later proved that Senna was not the father.

===Wealth, properties and endorsements===
At his death, Senna&#x27;s estate was estimated at $400 million. Senna owned several properties, including an organic farm in Tatuí, Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, an apartment in São Paulo, Brazil, an apartment in Monaco, an estate in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera, and a house in Algarve, Portugal. He owned a private jet (British Aerospace 125) and a helicopter, the latter of which he piloted to travel between his various Brazilian residences.As part of his close relationship with Honda, Senna endorsed Honda sportscars, including the Honda Prelude and the Honda NSX. He helped test and fine-tune the NSX, working directly with chief NSX engineer Shigeru Uehara and his team during five testing sessions at Suzuka. Honda credited Senna&#x27;s feedback, explaining that Senna encouraged Uehara to increase the stiffness of the chassis. In return, Honda gave Senna a custom-made black NSX. He also drove two other NSX cars owned by Honda Portugal and Senna&#x27;s friend Antonio Carlos de Almeida Braga.

In 1993, Senna signed a lucrative agreement to import, market, and sell Audi cars in Brazil. Sales began in April 1994, just a month before his untimely death. In 1999, Audi Senna was created as a joint venture of Audi with Senna Import. Aside from the black NSX mentioned above, Senna&#x27;s other personal car in 1994 was a silver Audi 100 S4 Avant. Senna also endorsed the Ducati 916 motorbike shortly before his death in 1994.

In the early 1990s, Senna developed his own merchandise brand represented by a logo with a double S, after his full surname, &quot;Senna da Silva&quot;. This logo is meant to represent an S chicane on a racing circuit. The Senna brand was used for apparel, watches, bicycles (Carraro), motorcycles and boats. Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Universal Genève have created limited-edition watches to honour Senna, both during his lifetime and after his death.

Senna also endorsed several video games and multimedia offerings, including 1992&#x27;s &quot;Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Super Monaco GP II&quot;, which featured pre-recorded advice from Senna and included Senna&#x27;s personal farm circuit in Tatuí as one of the possible tracks. Senna also contributed several interviews to the Japan-exclusive &quot;Ayrton Senna Personal Talk: Message for the Future,&quot; a multimedia compact disc for the Sega Saturn. &quot;Ayrton Senna Kart Duel&quot;, a series of kart racing games using his branding was released for the Playstation 1 in 1996, followed by two sequels in 1997 and 1999. Senna continues to feature in video games following his death. In 2013, &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot; released a Senna-centered expansion pack, with some of the proceeds going to help the IAS. In 2019, &quot;F1 2019&quot; released a DLC focusing on the Senna-Prost rivalry.

===Hobbies===
Senna enjoyed a range of physical activities including running, waterskiing, jet skiing, and paddleboarding. He also had several hobbies, such as flying real and model planes and helicopters, boating, fishing, and riding Ducati motorbikes.

For his 29th birthday in 1989, the Brazilian Air Force gave Senna a flight on one of their jet fighters (a Dassault Mirage III), which bears commemorative livery and is now exhibited at the Aerospace Museum of Rio de Janeiro. After a three-ship flyover of the type at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix, Senna was given a joyride in an RAAF F-111C.

In 1992, Senna received a fine and a temporary driving ban in the United Kingdom after driving a Porsche at speeds up to 121 mph (194.7 km/h) on the M25 near London.

==Racing legacy==

===Appraisals===
Near the end of his career, Senna was almost universally recognized as the best driver in the sport. In 1993, a poll of Formula One drivers gave Senna a near-unanimous vote as the best driver in Formula One.

Following Senna&#x27;s death, various polls and ranking services have rated him the best driver of all time.

* 2004: A poll on the &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine.
* 2009: A poll of 217 current and former Formula One drivers conducted by &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine.
* 2010: A poll of F1 drivers conducted by German newspaper &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot;.
* 2012: A poll of &quot;BBC Sport&quot; journalists.
* 2020: Formula One, sponsored by Amazon Web Services, used AWS machine learning algorithms to compare drivers&#x27; qualifying performances. The algorithm named Senna the fastest qualifier of all time. 

In April 2000, Senna was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. That year, the British public also voted Senna&#x27;s opening lap of the 1993 European Grand Prix, the 43rd in the list of the &quot;100 Greatest Sporting Moments&quot;.

===Driver safety===
Towards the end of his career, Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death, he spoke with current and former rivals and friends, including Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, about reforming the Formula One drivers&#x27; union, the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association. Senna wanted the GPDA to advocate for safety reforms.

Following the events of Imola 1994, Formula One enacted a variety of safety improvements. These included improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards, and significant cuts to engine power. On-track medical procedures were revised, and the Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered in 1995.

===Racing persona===
Senna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life, saying: &quot;The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It&#x27;s lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation.&quot;

Senna was proud of his driving ability, and responded angrily to criticism. In 2000, &quot;Autocourse&quot; noted that &quot;Senna was the one driver who genuinely cared where he was ranked in [&quot;Autocourse&quot;&#x27;s ranking of the year&#x27;s] Top 10 drivers,&quot; and took being placed below his rivals as a personal slight. (Senna was ranked No. 1 in 1988, 1991, and 1993.) In 1990, &quot;Autocourse&quot; dropped Senna from No. 1 to No. 2 to criticize him for wrecking Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990. Senna was so outraged that despite being given the No. 1 driver award in 1991, Senna refused to write the usually customary foreword by the year&#x27;s World Champion; Honda&#x27;s Head of Racing wrote the foreword instead. In 1993, &quot;Autocourse&quot; ranked Senna No. 1 even though Prost took the title that year, writing that Senna had &quot;intense egocentricity and uniquely flawed genius&quot; and &quot;matchless genius in the wet&quot;.

Although Senna cultivated a public image of &quot;an inward-looking, aloof driver who is hard to get along with,&quot; Senna was close friends with McLaren teammate Gerhard Berger. The two frequently played practical jokes on each other. Berger summed up their relationship by saying &quot;He taught me a lot about our sport, I taught him to laugh.&quot; Senna&#x27;s press officer selected Berger and Emerson Fittipaldi to lead the procession of Formula One greats at Senna&#x27;s funeral.

==Cultural legacy==
A Brazilian cultural icon, Senna remains a national hero in Brazil. In addition, in 2006, the Japanese public ranked Senna 22nd in Nippon TV&#x27;s survey of Japan&#x27;s favourite persons in history.

===Formula One memorials to Senna===
Various tracks feature Senna memorials. A statue of Senna stands in a park in Imola, near the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari&#x27;s Tamburello corner. Adelaide, reportedly one of Senna&#x27;s favourite circuits and the track where he scored his final Formula One race win, installed a plaque bearing Senna&#x27;s signature and hand prints in 1995, while the chicane at the end of the pit straight on the Adelaide Street Circuit has since been re-named the Senna Chicane. Monaco, where Senna triumphed a record six times, installed a plaque in Senna&#x27;s honour at the Fairmont/Lowes hairpin in 2007. Adelaide, Interlagos, Jerez, Hockenheim, Montreal, Snetterton, Estoril, and Buenos Aires have all renamed portions of their track after Senna.

From 1995 to 2021, Williams included a small &quot;S&quot; logo on the front wing of all of its cars to honour Senna and support the IAS. Following the Williams family&#x27;s sale of the team to Dorilton Capital, the logo was removed. The team announced plans to open a new space fully dedicated to the Brazilian driver in the Williams museum in Grove.

In July 2013, Honda released an audio-visual tribute titled &quot;Sound of Honda – Ayrton Senna 1989&quot;. Using the telemetry and sound of Senna&#x27;s Honda-powered McLaren MP4/5, Honda recreated Senna&#x27;s record-setting lap at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix by positioning speakers and lights along the Suzuka Circuit. The lights traced Senna&#x27;s real-life path and were synchronized to Senna&#x27;s actual laptime.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton idolized Senna as a boy and has conducted various tributes for Senna throughout his career. When Hamilton matched Senna&#x27;s three titles in 2015, Viviane Senna presented Hamilton with an Ian Berry artwork. Hamilton wore Senna tribute helmets at the Brazil races in 2011, 2015, and 2016, with the Senna family&#x27;s support. When Hamilton matched Senna&#x27;s 65 pole positions in 2017, the Senna family presented Hamilton with a race-worn Senna helmet. At the 2021 São Paulo Grand Prix, Hamilton delighted the crowd by waving a Brazilian flag during his victory lap, homaging Senna&#x27;s victory celebration from the 1991 Brazilian Grand Prix (Senna&#x27;s first-ever win in Brazil) thirty years earlier. The Brazilian government granted Hamilton honorary citizenship in 2022. Hamilton repeated the Brazilian flag tribute at the 2024 São Paulo Grand Prix, this time driving Senna&#x27;s 1990 McLaren MP4/5B.

===Permanent memorials to Senna===
Statues of Senna have been erected in Barcelona, Spain, and Wałbrzych, Poland (statue). 

In Brazil, a major freeway and tunnel in São Paulo and a freeway in Rio de Janeiro are named after Senna. Outside Brazil, Senna&#x27;s name graces a road in Senna&#x27;s favoured resort town of Quinta do Lago, Algarve, Portugal; a street in Tilehurst, Reading, England, where Senna lived during his years as a junior racer; a road in the Adelaide suburb of Wingfield; and a street and museum in Wałbrzych, Poland. Outside Earth, minor planet 6543 Senna is also named for Senna.

In September 2024, a property developer in collaboration with the Senna family announced plans to build the Senna Tower, a supertall residential skyscraper in Balneário Camboriú, Brazil.

===Anniversary tributes===
2004 marked the 10th anniversary of Senna&#x27;s death. On 21 April 2004, Imola hosted a charity football match attended by over 10,000 people. The match featured members of Brazil&#x27;s 1994 World Cup-winning team competing against an exhibition team of Formula One drivers. Viviane Senna presided at the kickoff. The match finished 5–5 and all profits were donated to the IAS. In addition, the book &quot;Ayrton: O Herói Revelado&quot; (Ayrton: The Hero Revealed) was published.

2010 marked the year of Senna&#x27;s 50th birthday. In March, Senna&#x27;s favourite football team, Corinthians, played a video in Senna&#x27;s memory. In July, Lewis Hamilton paid tribute to Senna by driving his title-winning McLaren MP4/4 on an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. In October, StudioCanal, Working Title Films, and Midfield Films released Asif Kapadia&#x27;s BAFTA-winning documentary &quot;Senna&quot;, which traces Senna&#x27;s championship years at McLaren and his efforts to improve safety in the sport.

2014 marked the 20th anniversary of Senna&#x27;s death. Many tributes took place to commemorate his life.

* The Imola Circuit hosted a memorial ceremony and moment of silence on 1 May 2014, the anniversary. Senna&#x27;s friend Gerhard Berger and various drivers associated with Italy and Ferrari were in attendance.
* San Marino issued a series of commemorative stamps and silver proof coins.
* During the Brazilian Carnival celebrations, the samba group Unidos da Tijuca received a prize for a Senna-themed parade.
* Senna&#x27;s birthday was marked by a Google Doodle.
* Brazilian regional airline Azul Linhas Aereas named a plane after Senna and painted it in the colours of Senna&#x27;s helmet. 
* French company Art Mint produced a series of commemorative coins designed by a Brazilian artist.
* British artist Ian Berry unveiled a portrait of Ayrton at the Instituto Ayrton Senna, with Senna&#x27;s family in attendance. 

2019 marked the 25th anniversary of Senna&#x27;s death. The organisers of the 2019 Spanish Grand Prix presented race winner Lewis Hamilton with a half-Austrian, half-Brazilian flag in honour of Senna and Roland Ratzenberger.

===Posthumous licensing of the Senna brand===
The Instituto Ayrton Senna (IAS) occasionally licenses Senna&#x27;s brand for various commercial and charitable enterprises, mostly related to motorsport.

* Ducati produced three special Senna editions of the Ducati 916 superbike (1996–1998) and the 1199 Panigale S Senna (2013).
* MV Agusta released two limited-edition motorbikes, the F4 750 Senna (2002) and the F4 Senna 1000 (2006). All profits were donated to the IAS.
* During the brief McLaren-Honda reunion in the 2010s, Honda and McLaren ran advertising campaigns recalling the Senna legend.
* In 2014, the IAS commissioned a commemorative Vespa that was auctioned off for charity. It was custom-painted in the colours of Senna&#x27;s helmet, and its design recalled Piaggio&#x27;s sponsorship gifts to Formula One polesitters.
* In 2017, McLaren Automotive produced the McLaren Senna, a 789-horsepower supercar.
* In 2017, American firm Rosland Capital produced a series of commemorative coins featuring Senna.
* In 2018, Nike and the Corinthians football team unveiled a special Senna kit to commemorate Senna&#x27;s first World Championship, with the tagline #LuteAtéSerEterno [fight until you&#x27;re eternal].

==In popular culture==
As part of Japanese publisher Shueisha&#x27;s sponsorship of McLaren, Senna collaborated with Akira Toriyama, the creator of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, on artwork for &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; featuring McLaren-themed illustrations of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters. Senna was also featured in &quot;GP Boy&quot;, a two-volume manga published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; to commemorate Shueisha&#x27;s sponsorship, and in &quot;F1 no Senkō&quot;, also published on Jump, which recounts the 1991 Formula One season from Senna&#x27;s perspective.

Senna launched the cartoon character Senninha (&quot;Little Senna&quot;) in 1993/94 to appeal to Brazilian children. A Senninha comic book ran from 1994 to 2000, with a brief relaunch in 2008.

Senna is mentioned in episode 151 of the Japanese animated series Gintama, along with two other F1 drivers, Jacques Villeneuve and Rubens Barrichello.

Senna&#x27;s nephew Bruno voiced an animated depiction of his uncle in McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Tooned&quot; cartoon series to commemorate McLaren&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Episode 6 of the series&#x27; second season tells a fictionalized account of Senna&#x27;s career with McLaren involving a rivalry with the character Professor M (voiced by Alexander Armstrong).

In 2024, Netflix released an eponymous biographical miniseries based on Senna&#x27;s life, starring Gabriel Leone as Senna.

Senna has been referenced by several songwriters:

* Portuguese rock band Os Pontos Negros have a song titled &quot;Senna&quot; in their 2012 Soba Lobi album
* Italian rock band The Rock Alchemist&#x27;s 2012 song &quot;Live or Die&quot; and its accompanying 2018 music video are inspired by the life and character of Senna
* Jazz pianist Kim Pensyl (song called &quot;Senna&#x27;s Samba&quot;)
* Japanese jazz-fusion guitarist and T-square bandleader Masahiro Andoh (references in songs such as &quot;Faces&quot; and subsequent revisions, like &quot;The Face&quot;)
* Chris Rea (on his song &quot;Saudade&quot;)
* Spanish band Delorean (extended play called &quot;Ayrton Senna&quot;)
* British acid jazz band Corduroy (song called &quot;Ayrton Senna&quot;)
* Italian singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla (song titled &quot;Ayrton&quot;).

==Helmet design==
In his karting days, Senna&#x27;s helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent. He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet, before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe&#x27;s color) that was first seen in 1979. Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.

According to Mosca, the blue and green stripes symbolised movement and aggression, while the overall yellow colour symbolised youth; the three colors were also identifiable with the flag of Brazil. The helmet never had significant changes, apart from sponsorship. One such change was that Senna occasionally altered the stripe from blue to black. The tone of yellow changed a number of times, while usually a rich sunburst yellow, in 1985 and 1986 in some races, he used a fluorescent neon yellow colour. In 1994, the helmet was a lighter, paler yellow to complement the blue and white of the Williams car.

Senna used a number of helmet brands throughout his career. From 1977 to 1989, he used Bell (Star from 1977 to 1982 and XFM-1 from 1983 to 1989). From 1990 to 1991, he used Honda&#x27;s own Rheos brand. From 1992 to 1993, he used Shoei (X-4). For 1994, he returned to using Bell (M3 Kevlar). The helmet worn by Senna in the fatal race was returned to Bell in 2002 and was incinerated while family members watched.

===Third-party adaptations===
Senna&#x27;s nephew Bruno wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career. The stripes were shaped after an S rather than being straight, there was a green stripe under the chin, and there was a blue rounded rectangle near the top. Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Senna&#x27;s last world championship.

At the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello incorporated part of Senna&#x27;s helmet design into his own. As mentioned above, Lewis Hamilton has also worn Senna tribute helmets on several occasions.

Outside of motor racing, Brazilian cyclist Murilo Fischer wore a helmet based on Senna&#x27;s helmet colour scheme of yellow with green and blue stripes on stage 11 of the 2015 Giro d&#x27;Italia, which finished on the Imola circuit. For the 2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, Pierre Gasly wore a special helmet with Senna&#x27;s colours and the Senna Sempre (Senna Forever) badging on top.

<text>Anti-aircraft warfare is the counter to aerial warfare and includes &quot;all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action&quot;. It encompasses surface-based, subsurface (submarine-launched), and air-based weapon systems, in addition to associated sensor systems, command and control arrangements, and passive measures (e.g. barrage balloons). It may be used to protect naval, ground, and air forces in any location. However, for most countries, the main effort has tended to be homeland defence. Missile defence is an extension of air defence, as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight.

Most modern anti-aircraft (AA) weapons systems are optimized for short-, medium-, or long-range air defence, although some systems may incorporate multiple weapons (such as both autocannons and surface-to-air missiles). ‘Layered air defence’ usually refers to multiple ‘tiers’ of air defence systems which, when combined, an airborne threat must penetrate to reach its target; This defence is usually accomplished via the combined use of systems optimized for either short-, medium-, or long-range air defence.

In some countries, such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War, the Soviet Union, and modern NATO and the United States, ground-based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control. However, while overall air defence may be for homeland defence (including military facilities), forces in the field, wherever they are, provide their own defences against airborne threats.

Until the 1950s, guns firing ballistic munitions ranging from 7.62 mm (.30 in) to 152.4 mm (6 in) were the standard weapons; guided missiles then became dominant, except at the very shortest ranges (as with close-in weapon systems, which typically use rotary autocannons or, in very modern systems, surface-to-air adaptations of short-range air-to-air missiles, often combined in one system with rotary cannons).

==Terminology==
It may also be called &quot;counter-air&quot;, &quot;anti-air&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;flak&quot;, &quot;layered air defence&quot; or &quot;air defence forces&quot;.

The term &quot;air defence&quot; was probably first used by the UK when Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) was created as a Royal Air Force command in 1925. However, arrangements in the UK were also called &quot;anti-aircraft&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;AA&quot;, a term that remained in general use into the 1950s. After the First World War it was sometimes prefixed by &quot;light&quot; or &quot;heavy&quot; (&quot;LAA&quot; or &quot;HAA&quot;) to classify a type of gun or unit. Nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include:

* &quot;AA&quot;: abbreviations of &quot;anti-aircraft&quot;
* &quot;AAA&quot; or &quot;triple-A&quot;: abbreviations of &quot;anti-aircraft artillery&quot;
* &quot;flak&quot;: from the German &quot;Flugzeugabwehrkanone&quot; or &quot;Fliegerabwehrkanone&quot;
* &quot;ack-ack&quot;: from the spelling alphabet used by the British for voice transmission of &quot;AA&quot;)
* &quot;archie&quot;: a World War I British term probably coined by Amyas Borton, and believed to derive via the Royal Flying Corps, from the music-hall comedian George Robey&#x27;s line &quot;Archibald, certainly not!&quot;

NATO defines anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) as &quot;measures taken to defend a maritime force against attacks by airborne weapons launched from aircraft, ships, submarines and land-based sites&quot;. In some armies the term &quot;all-arms air defence&quot; (AAAD) is used for air defence by nonspecialist troops. Other terms from the late 20th century include &quot;ground based air defence&quot; (GBAD) with related terms &quot;short range air defense&quot; (SHORAD) and man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS). Anti-aircraft missiles are variously called surface-to-air missiles, (&quot;SAMs&quot;) and surface-to-air guided weapons (SAGWs). Examples are the RIM-66 Standard, Raytheon Standard Missile 6, or the MBDA Aster missile.

Non-English terms for air defence include the German term &quot;Flak&quot; or &quot;FlaK&quot; (&quot;Fliegerabwehrkanone&quot;, &#x27;aircraft defence cannon&#x27;, also cited as &quot;Flugabwehrkanone&quot;), and the Russian term &quot;Protivovozdushnaya oborona&quot; (Cyrillic: Противовозду́шная оборо́на), &#x27;anti-air defence&#x27;, abbreviated as PVO. In Russian, the AA systems are called &quot;zenitnye&quot; (i.e., &#x27;pointing to zenith&#x27;) systems. In French, air defence is called &quot;Défense contre les aéronefs (DCA)&quot; , &#x27;defence against aircraft&#x27;.

The maximum distance at which a gun or missile can engage an aircraft is an important figure. However, many different definitions are used and unless the same definition is used, performance of different guns or missiles cannot be compared. For AA guns only the ascending part of the trajectory can be usefully used. One term is &quot;ceiling&quot;, the maximum ceiling being the height a projectile would reach if fired vertically, not practically useful in itself as few AA guns are able to fire vertically, and the maximum fuse duration may be too short, but potentially useful as a standard to compare different weapons.

The British adopted &quot;effective ceiling&quot;, meaning the altitude at which a gun could deliver a series of shells against a moving target; this could be constrained by maximum fuse running time as well as the gun&#x27;s capability. By the late 1930s the British definition was &quot;that height at which a directly approaching target at can be engaged for 20 seconds before the gun reaches 70 degrees elevation&quot;.

== General description ==

The essence of air defence is to detect hostile aircraft and destroy them. The critical issue is to hit a target moving in three-dimensional space; an attack must not only match these three coordinates, but must do so at the time the target is at that position. This means that projectiles either have to be guided to hit the target, or aimed at the predicted position of the target at the time the projectile reaches it, taking into account the speed and direction of both the target and the projectile.

Throughout the 20th century, air defence was one of the fastest-evolving areas of military technology, responding to the evolution of aircraft and exploiting technology such as radar, guided missiles and computing (initially electromechanical analogue computing from the 1930s on, as with equipment described below). Improvements were made to sensors, technical fire control, weapons, and command and control. At the start of the 20th century these were either very primitive or non-existent.

Initially sensors were optical and acoustic devices developed during World War I and continued into the 1930s, but were quickly superseded by radar, which in turn was supplemented by optoelectronics in the 1980s.
Command and control remained primitive until the late 1930s, when Britain created an integrated system for ADGB that linked the ground-based air defence of the British Army&#x27;s Anti-Aircraft Command, although field-deployed air defence relied on less sophisticated arrangements. NATO later called these arrangements an &quot;air defence ground environment&quot;, defined as &quot;the network of ground radar sites and command and control centres within a specific theatre of operations which are used for the tactical control of air defence operations&quot;.

Rules of engagement are critical to prevent air defences engaging friendly or neutral aircraft. Their use is assisted but not governed by identification friend or foe (IFF) electronic devices originally introduced during the Second World War. While these rules originate at the highest authority, different rules can apply to different types of air defence covering the same area at the same time. AAAD usually operates under the tightest rules.

NATO calls these rules &quot;weapon control orders&quot; (WCO), they are:
* &quot;Weapons free&quot;: weapons may be fired at any target not positively recognised as friendly.
* &quot;Weapons tight&quot;: weapons may be fired only at targets recognised as hostile.
* &quot;Weapons hold&quot;: weapons may only be fired in self-defence or in response to a formal order.

Until the 1950s, guns firing ballistic munitions were the standard weapon; guided missiles then became dominant, except at the very shortest ranges. However, the type of shell or warhead and its fuzing and, with missiles, the guidance arrangement were and are varied. Targets are not always easy to destroy; nonetheless, damaged aircraft may be forced to abort their mission and, even if they manage to return and land in friendly territory, may be out of action for days or permanently. Ignoring small arms and smaller machine-guns, ground-based air defence guns have varied in calibre from 20 mm to at least 152 mm.

Ground-based air defence is deployed in several ways:
* Self-defence by ground forces using their organic weapons, AAAD.
* Accompanying defence, specialist air defence elements accompanying armoured or infantry units.
* Point defence around a key target, such as a bridge, critical government building or ship.
* Area air defence, typically &quot;belts&quot; of air defence to provide a barrier, but sometimes an umbrella covering an area. Areas can vary widely in size. They may extend along a nation&#x27;s border, e.g. the Cold War MIM-23 Hawk and Nike belts that ran north–south across Germany, across a military formation&#x27;s manoeuvre area, or above a city or port. In ground operations air defence areas may be used offensively by rapid redeployment across current aircraft transit routes.

Air defence has included other elements, although after the Second World War most fell into disuse:
* Tethered barrage balloons to deter and threaten aircraft flying below the height of the balloons, where they are susceptible to damaging collisions with steel tethers.
* Cables strung across valleys, sometimes forming a &quot;curtain&quot; with vertical cables hanging from them.
* Searchlights to illuminate aircraft at night for both gun-layers and optical instrument operators. During World War II searchlights became radar controlled.
* Large smoke screens created by large smoke canisters on the ground to screen targets and prevent accurate weapon aiming by aircraft.
Passive air defence is defined by NATO as &quot;Passive measures taken for the physical defence and protection of personnel, essential installations and equipment in order to minimise the effectiveness of air and/or missile attack&quot;. It remains a vital activity by ground forces and includes camouflage and concealment to avoid detection by reconnaissance and attacking aircraft. Measures such as camouflaging important buildings were common in the Second World War. During the Cold War the runways and taxiways of some airfields were painted green.

== Organization ==
While navies are usually responsible for their own air defence—at least for ships at sea—organisational arrangements for land-based air defence vary between nations and over time.

The most extreme case was the Soviet Union and this model may still be followed in some countries: it was a separate service, on a par with the army, navy, or air force. In the Soviet Union, this was called &quot;Voyska PVO&quot;, and had both fighter aircraft, separate from the air force, and ground-based systems. This was divided into two arms, &quot;PVO Strany,&quot; the Strategic Air defence Service responsible for Air Defence of the Homeland, created in 1941 and becoming an independent service in 1954, and &quot;PVO SV,&quot; Air Defence of the Ground Forces. Subsequently, these became part of the air force and ground forces respectively.

At the other extreme, the United States Army has an Air Defense Artillery Branch that provides ground-based air defence for both homeland and the army in the field; however, it is operationally under the Joint Force Air Component Commander. Many other nations also deploy an air-defence branch in the army. Some, such as Japan or Israel, choose to integrate their ground based air defence systems into their air force.

In Britain and some other armies, the single artillery branch has been responsible for both home and overseas ground-based air defence, although there was divided responsibility with the Royal Navy for air defence of the British Isles in World War I. However, during the Second World War, the RAF Regiment was formed to protect airfields everywhere, and this included light air defences. In the later decades of the Cold War this included the United States Air Force&#x27;s operating bases in the UK. All ground-based air defence was removed from Royal Air Force (RAF) jurisdiction in 2004. The British Army&#x27;s Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded in March 1955, but during the 1960s and 1970s the RAF&#x27;s Fighter Command operated long-range air-defence missiles to protect key areas in the UK. During World War II, the Royal Marines also provided air defence units; formally part of the mobile naval base defence organisation, they were handled as an integral part of the army-commanded ground based air defences.

The basic air defence unit is typically a battery with 2 to 12 guns or missile launchers and fire control elements. These batteries, particularly with guns, usually deploy in a small area, although batteries may be split; this is usual for some missile systems. SHORAD missile batteries often deploy across an area with individual launchers several kilometres apart. When MANPADS is operated by specialists, batteries may have several dozen teams deploying separately in small sections; self-propelled air defence guns may deploy in pairs.

Batteries are usually grouped into battalions or equivalent. In the field army, a light gun or SHORAD battalion is often assigned to a manoeuvre division. Heavier guns and long-range missiles may be in air-defence brigades and come under corps or higher command. Homeland air defence may have a full military structure. For example, the UK&#x27;s Anti-Aircraft Command, commanded by a full British Army general was part of ADGB. At its peak in 1941–42 it comprised three AA corps with 12 AA divisions between them.

=== Earliest use ===
The use of balloons by the U.S. Army during the American Civil War compelled the Confederates to develop methods of combating them. These included the use of artillery, small arms, and saboteurs. They were unsuccessful, and internal politics led the United States Army&#x27;s Balloon Corps to be disbanded mid-war. The Confederates experimented with balloons as well.

Turks carried out the first ever anti-airplane operation in history during the Italo-Turkish war. Although lacking anti-aircraft weapons, they were the first to shoot down an airplane by rifle fire. The first aircraft to crash in a war was the one of Lieutenant Piero Manzini, shot down on 25 August 1912.

The earliest known use of weapons specifically made for the anti-aircraft role occurred during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. After the disaster at Sedan, Paris was besieged and French troops outside the city started an attempt at communication via balloon. Gustav Krupp mounted a modified 1-pounder (37 mm) gun – the &quot;Ballonabwehrkanone&quot; (Balloon defence cannon) or &quot;BaK&quot; — on top of a horse-drawn carriage for the purpose of shooting down these balloons.

By the early 20th century balloon, or airship, guns, for land and naval use were attracting attention. Various types of ammunition were proposed, high explosive, incendiary, bullet-chains, rod bullets and shrapnel. The need for some form of tracer or smoke trail was articulated. Fuzing options were also examined, both impact and time types. Mountings were generally pedestal type but could be on field platforms. Trials were underway in most countries in Europe but only Krupp, Erhardt, Vickers Maxim, and Schneider had published any information by 1910. Krupp&#x27;s designs included adaptations of their 65 mm 9-pounder, a 75 mm 12-pounder, and even a 105 mm gun. Erhardt also had a 12-pounder, while Vickers Maxim offered a 3-pounder and Schneider a 47 mm. The French balloon gun appeared in 1910, it was an 11-pounder but mounted on a vehicle, with a total uncrewed weight of two tons. However, since balloons were slow moving, sights were simple. But the challenges of faster moving aeroplanes were recognised.

By 1913 only France and Germany had developed field guns suitable for engaging balloons and aircraft and addressed issues of military organisation. Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy would soon introduce the QF 3-inch and QF 4-inch AA guns and also had Vickers 1-pounder quick firing &quot;pom-poms&quot; that could be used in various mountings.

The first US anti-aircraft cannon was a 1-pounder concept design by Admiral Twining in 1911 to meet the perceived threat of airships, that eventually was used as the basis for the US Navy&#x27;s first operational anti-aircraft cannon: the 3-inch/23 caliber gun.

=== First World War ===


On 30 September 1915, troops of the Serbian Army observed three enemy aircraft approaching Kragujevac. Soldiers fired at them with shotguns and machine-guns but failed to prevent them from dropping 45 bombs over the city, hitting military installations, the railway station and many other, mostly civilian, targets in the city. During the bombing raid, private Radoje Ljutovac fired his cannon at the enemy aircraft and successfully shot one down. It crashed in the city and both pilots died from their injuries. The cannon Ljutovac used was not designed as an anti-aircraft gun; it was a slightly modified Turkish cannon captured during the First Balkan War in 1912. This was the first occasion in military history that a military aircraft was shot down with ground-to-air artillery fire.

The British recognised the need for anti-aircraft capability a few weeks before World War I broke out; on 8 July 1914, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the British government had decided to &quot;dot the coasts of the British Isles with a series of towers, each armed with two quick-firing guns of special design,&quot; while &quot;a complete circle of towers&quot; was to be built around &quot;naval installations&quot; and &quot;at other especially vulnerable points&quot;. By December 1914 the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) was manning AA guns and searchlights assembled from various sources at some nine ports. The Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) was given responsibility for AA defence in the field, using motorised two-gun sections. The first were formally formed in November 1914. Initially they used QF 1-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot;s (37 mm versions of the Maxim Gun).
All armies soon deployed AA guns often based on their smaller field pieces, notably the French 75 mm and Russian 76.2 mm, typically simply propped up on some sort of embankment to get the muzzle pointed skyward. The British Army adopted the 13-pounder quickly producing new mountings suitable for AA use, the 13-pdr QF 6 cwt Mk III was issued in 1915. It remained in service throughout the war but 18-pdr guns were lined down to take the 13-pdr shell with a larger cartridge producing the 13-pr QF 9 cwt and these proved much more satisfactory. However, in general, these ad hoc solutions proved largely useless. With little experience in the role, no means of measuring target, range, height or speed the difficulty of observing their shell bursts relative to the target gunners proved unable to get their fuse setting correct and most rounds burst well below their targets. The exception to this rule was the guns protecting spotting balloons, in which case the altitude could be accurately measured from the length of the cable holding the balloon.

The first issue was ammunition. Before the war it was recognised that ammunition needed to explode in the air. Both high explosive (HE) and shrapnel were used, mostly the former. Airburst fuses were either igniferious (based on a burning fuse) or mechanical (clockwork). Igniferious fuses were not well suited for anti-aircraft use. The fuse length was determined by time of flight, but the burning rate of the gunpowder was affected by altitude. The British pom-poms had only contact-fused ammunition. Zeppelins, being hydrogen-filled balloons, were targets for incendiary shells and the British introduced these with airburst fuses, both shrapnel type-forward projection of incendiary &quot;pot&quot; and base ejection of an incendiary stream. The British also fitted tracers to their shells for use at night. Smoke shells were also available for some AA guns, these bursts were used as targets during training.

German air attacks on the British Isles increased in 1915 and the AA efforts were deemed somewhat ineffective, so a Royal Navy gunnery expert, Admiral Sir Percy Scott, was appointed to make improvements, particularly an integrated AA defence for London. The air defences were expanded with more RNVR AA guns, 75 mm and 3-inch, the pom-poms being ineffective. The naval 3-inch was also adopted by the army, the QF 3-inch 20 cwt (76 mm), a new field mounting was introduced in 1916. Since most attacks were at night, searchlights were soon used, and acoustic methods of detection and locating were developed. By December 1916 there were 183 AA sections defending Britain (most with the 3-inch), 74 with the BEF in France and 10 in the Middle East.

AA gunnery was a difficult business. The problem was of successfully aiming a shell to burst close to its target&#x27;s future position, with various factors affecting the shells&#x27; predicted trajectory. This was called deflection gun-laying, where &quot;off-set&quot; angles for range and elevation were set on the gunsight and updated as their target moved. In this method, when the sights were on the target, the barrel was pointed at the target&#x27;s future position. Range and height of the target determined fuse length. The difficulties increased as aircraft performance improved.

The British dealt with range measurement first, when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting. This led to the height/range finder (HRF), the first model being the Barr &amp; Stroud UB2, a two-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod. It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle, which together gave the height of the aircraft. These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used. The HRF was soon joined by the height/fuse indicator (HFI), this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves, using the height reported by the HRF operator, the necessary fuse length could be read off.

However, the problem of deflection settings — &quot;aim-off&quot; — required knowing the rate of change in the target&#x27;s position. Both France and the UK introduced tachymetric devices to track targets and produce vertical and horizontal deflection angles. The French Brocq system was electrical; the operator entered the target range and had displays at guns; it was used with their 75 mm. The British Wilson-Dalby gun director used a pair of trackers and mechanical tachymetry; the operator entered the fuse length, and deflection angles were read from the instruments.

By the start of World War I, the 77 mm had become the standard German weapon, and came mounted on a large traverse that could be easily transported on a wagon. Krupp 75 mm guns were supplied with an optical sighting system that improved their capabilities. The German Army also adapted a revolving cannon that came to be known to Allied fliers as the &quot;flaming onion&quot; from the shells in flight. This gun had five barrels that quickly launched a series of 37 mm artillery shells.

As aircraft started to be used against ground targets on the battlefield, the AA guns could not be traversed quickly enough at close targets and, being relatively few, were not always in the right place (and were often unpopular with other troops), so changed positions frequently. Soon the forces were adding various machine-gun based weapons mounted on poles. These short-range weapons proved more deadly, and the &quot;Red Baron&quot; is believed to have been shot down by an anti-aircraft Vickers machine gun. When the war ended, it was clear that the increasing capabilities of aircraft would require better means of acquiring targets and aiming at them. Nevertheless, a pattern had been set: anti-aircraft warfare would employ heavy weapons to attack high-altitude targets and lighter weapons for use when aircraft came to lower altitudes.


=== Interwar years ===
World War I demonstrated that aircraft could be an important part of the battlefield, but in some nations it was the prospect of strategic air attack that was the main issue, presenting both a threat and an opportunity. The experience of four years of air attacks on London by Zeppelins and Gotha G.V bombers had particularly influenced the British and was one of if not the main driver for forming an independent air force. As the capabilities of aircraft and their engines improved it was clear that their role in future war would be even more critical as their range and weapon load grew. However, in the years immediately after World War I, the prospect of another major war seemed remote, particularly in Europe, where the most militarily capable nations were, and little financing was available.

Four years of war had seen the creation of a new and technically demanding branch of military activity. Air defence had made huge advances, albeit from a very low starting point. However, it was new and often lacked influential &#x27;friends&#x27; in the competition for a share of limited defence budgets. Demobilisation meant that most AA guns were taken out of service, leaving only the most modern.

However, there were lessons to be learned. In particular the British, who had had AA guns in most theatres in action in daylight and used them against night attacks at home. Furthermore, they had also formed an Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section during the war and accumulated large amounts of data that was subjected to extensive analysis. As a result, they published the two-volume &quot;Textbook of Anti-Aircraft Gunnery&quot; in 1924–1925. It included five key recommendations for HAA equipment:
* Shells of improved ballistic shape with HE fillings and mechanical time fuses
* Higher rates of fire assisted by automation
* Height finding by long-base optical instruments
* Centralised control of fire on each gun position, directed by tachymetric instruments incorporating the facility to apply corrections of the moment for meteorological and wear factors
* More accurate sound-location for the direction of searchlights and to provide plots for barrage fire
Two assumptions underpinned the British approach to HAA fire; first, aimed fire was the primary method and this was enabled by predicting gun data from visually tracking the target and having its height. Second, that the target would maintain a steady course, speed and height. This HAA was to engage targets up to . Mechanical time fuses were required because the speed of powder burning varied with height, so fuse length was not a simple function of time of flight. Automated fire ensured a constant rate of fire that made it easier to predict where each shell should be individually aimed.

In 1925 the British adopted a new instrument developed by Vickers. It was a mechanical analogue computer – the Predictor AA No 1. Given the target height, its operators tracked the target and the predictor produced bearing, quadrant elevation and fuse setting. These were passed electrically to the guns, where they were displayed on repeater dials to the layers who &quot;matched pointers&quot; (target data and the gun&#x27;s actual data) to lay the guns. This system of repeater electrical dials built on the arrangements introduced by British coast artillery in the 1880s, and coast artillery was the background of many AA officers. Similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later Sperry M3A3 in the US, was also used by Britain as the Predictor AA No 2. Height finders were also increasing in size; in Britain, the optical base World War I Barr &amp; Stroud UB 2 stereoscopic rangefinder was replaced by the optical base UB 7 and the base UB 10 (only used on static AA sites). Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France produced instruments. However, in most countries the main effort in HAA guns until the mid-1930s was improving existing ones, although various new designs were on drawing boards.

From the early 1930s eight countries developed radar; these developments were sufficiently advanced by the late 1930s for development work on sound-locating acoustic devices to be generally halted, although equipment was retained. Furthermore, in Britain the volunteer Observer Corps formed in 1925 provided a network of observation posts to report hostile aircraft flying over Britain. Initially radar was used for airspace surveillance to detect approaching hostile aircraft. However, the German Würzburg radar put into use in 1940 was capable of providing data suitable for controlling AA guns, and the British Radar, Gun Laying, Mark I, was designed to be used on AA gun positions and was in use by 1939.

The Treaty of Versailles prevented Germany having AA weapons, and for example, the Krupps designers joined Bofors in Sweden. Some World War I guns were retained and some covert AA training started in the late 1920s. Germany introduced the 8.8 cm FlaK 18 in 1933, the 36 and 37 models followed with various improvements, but ballistic performance was unchanged. In the late 1930s the 10.5 cm FlaK 38 appeared, soon followed by the 39; this was designed primarily for static sites but had a mobile mounting, and the unit had 220 V 24 kW generators. In 1938 design started on the 12.8 cm FlaK.

Britain had successfully tested a new 3.6-inch gun, in 1918. In 1928 a gun became the preferred solution, but it took six years to gain funding. Production of the QF 3.7-inch gun began in 1937; this gun was used on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions. At the same time the Royal Navy adopted a new 4.5-inch (113 mm) gun in a twin turret, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available. The performance of the new guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a 30-second running time, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness. In 1939 a machine fuse setter was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting.

The US ended World War I with two 3-inch AA guns and improvements were developed throughout the inter-war period. However, in 1924 work started on a new 105 mm static mounting AA gun, but only a few were produced by the mid-1930s because by this time work had started on the 90 mm AA gun, with mobile carriages and static mountings able to engage air, sea and ground targets. The M1 version was approved in 1940. During the 1920s there was some work on a 4.7-inch which lapsed, but revived in 1937, leading to a new gun in 1944.

While HAA and its associated target acquisition and fire control was the primary focus of AA efforts, low-level close-range targets remained and by the mid-1930s were becoming an issue.

Until this time the British, at RAF insistence, continued their use of World War I machine guns, and introduced twin MG mountings for AAAD. The army was forbidden from considering anything larger than .50-inch. However, in 1935 their trials showed that the minimum effective round was an impact-fused 2 lb HE shell. The following year they decided to adopt the Bofors 40 mm and a twin barrel Vickers 2-pdr (40 mm) on a modified naval mount. The air-cooled Bofors was vastly superior for land use, being much lighter than the water-cooled &quot;pom-pom&quot;, and UK production of the Bofors 40 mm was licensed. The Predictor AA No 3, as the Kerrison Predictor was officially known, was introduced with it.

The 40 mm Bofors had become available in 1931. In the late 1920s the Swedish Navy had ordered the development of a 40 mm naval anti-aircraft gun from the Bofors company. It was light, rapid-firing and reliable, and a mobile version on a four-wheel carriage was soon developed. Known simply as the 40 mm, it was adopted by some 17 different nations just before World War II and is still in use today in some applications such as on coastguard frigates.

Rheinmetall in Germany developed an automatic 20 mm in the 1920s and Oerlikon in Switzerland had acquired the patent to an automatic 20 mm gun designed in Germany during World War I. Germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm FlaK 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by Mauser-Werke and became the 2 cm FlaK 38. Nevertheless, while 20 mm was better than a machine gun and mounted on a very small trailer made it easy to move, its effectiveness was limited. Germany therefore added a 3.7 cm. The first, the 3.7 cm FlaK 18 developed by Rheinmetall in the early 1930s, was basically an enlarged 2 cm FlaK 30. It was introduced in 1935 and production stopped the following year. A redesigned gun 3.7 cm FlaK 36 entered service in 1938, it too had a two-wheel carriage. However, by the mid-1930s the Luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between 3.7 cm and 8.8 cm guns. They started development of a 5 cm gun on a four-wheel carriage.

After World War I the US Army started developing a dual-role (AA/ground) automatic 37 mm cannon, designed by John M. Browning. It was standardised in 1927 as the T9 AA cannon, but trials quickly revealed that it was worthless in the ground role. However, while the shell was a bit light (well under 2 lbs) it had a good effective ceiling and fired 125 rounds per minute; an AA carriage was developed and it entered service in 1939 as the 37 mm gun M1. It proved prone to jamming, and was eventually replaced in AA units by the Bofors 40 mm. The Bofors had attracted attention from the US Navy, but none were acquired before 1939. Also, in 1931 the US Army worked on a mobile anti-aircraft machine mount on the back of a heavy truck having four .30 calibre water-cooled machine guns and an optical director. It proved unsuccessful and was abandoned.

The USSR introduced a new 76 mm &quot;M1931&quot; in 1937, an 85 mm &quot;M1938&quot; and developed the 37 mm M1939 (61-K), which appears to have been copied from the Bofors 40 mm. A Bofors 25 mm, essentially a scaled down 40 mm, was also copied as the 25 mm M1939.

During the 1930s solid-fuel rockets were under development in the Soviet Union and Britain. In Britain the interest was for anti-aircraft fire, it quickly became clear that guidance would be required for precision. However, rockets, or &quot;Unrotated Projectiles&quot; as they were called, could be used for anti-aircraft barrages. A two-inch rocket using HE or wire obstacle warheads – the Z Battery – was introduced first to deal with low-level or dive bombing attacks on smaller targets such as airfields. The three-inch was in development at the end of the inter-war period.

==== Naval aspects ====

WWI had been a war in which air warfare blossomed, but had not matured to the point of being a real threat to naval forces. The prevailing assumption was that a few relatively small caliber naval guns could manage to keep enemy aircraft beyond a range where harm might be expected. In 1939 radio controlled target drones became available to the US Navy in quantity allowing a more realistic testing of existing anti-aircraft suites against actual flying and manoeuvring targets. The results were sobering to an unexpected degree.

The United States was still emerging from the effects of the Great Depression and funds for the military had been sparse to the degree that 50% of shells used were still powder fused. The US Navy found that a significant portion of its shells were duds or low order detonations (incomplete detonation of the explosive contained by the shell). Virtually every major country involved in combat in World War II invested in aircraft development. The cost of aircraft research and development was small and the results could be large. So rapid was the performance leaps of evolving aircraft that the British High Angle Control System (HACS) was obsolete and designing a successor very difficult for the British establishment. Electronics would prove to be an enabler for effective anti-aircraft systems and both the US and UK had a growing electronics industry.

In 1939 radio controlled drones became available to actually test existing systems in British and American service. The results were disappointing by any measure. High-level manoeuvring drones were virtually immune to shipboard AA systems. The US drones could simulate dive bombing which showed the dire need for autocannons. Japan introduced powered gliders in 1940 as drones but apparently was unable to dive bomb. There is no evidence of other powers using drones in this application at all. It may have caused a major underestimation of the threat and an inflated view of their AA systems.

=== Second World War ===
Poland&#x27;s AA defences were no match for the German attack, and the situation was similar in other European countries. Significant AAW (Anti-Air Warfare) started with the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940. QF 3.7-inch AA guns provided the backbone of the ground-based AA defences, although initially significant numbers of QF 3-inch 20 cwt were also used. The Army&#x27;s Anti-aircraft command, which was under operational command of RAF Fighter Command within Air Defence GB, grew to 12 AA divisions in three AA corps. Bofors 40 mm guns entered service in increasing numbers. In addition, the RAF regiment was formed in 1941 with responsibility for airfield air defence, eventually with Bofors 40 mm as their main armament. Fixed AA defences, using HAA and LAA, were established by the Army in key overseas places, notably Malta, Suez Canal and Singapore.

While the 3.7-inch was the main HAA gun in fixed defences and the only mobile HAA gun with the field army, the QF 4.5-inch gun, manned by artillery, was used in the vicinity of naval ports and made use of the naval ammunition supply. The 4.5-inch at Singapore had the first success in shooting down Japanese bombers. Mid war QF 5.25-inch naval guns started being emplaced in some permanent sites around London. This gun was also deployed in dual-role coast defence/AA positions.

Germany&#x27;s high-altitude needs were originally going to be filled by a 75 mm gun from Krupp, designed in collaboration with their Swedish counterpart Bofors, but the specifications were later amended to require much higher performance. In response Krupp&#x27;s engineers presented a new 88 mm design, the FlaK 36. First used in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, the gun proved to be one of the best anti-aircraft guns in the world, as well as particularly deadly against light, medium, and even early heavy tanks.

After the Dambusters raid in 1943 an entirely new system was developed that was required to knock down any low-flying aircraft with a single hit. The first attempt to produce such a system used a 50 mm gun, but this proved inaccurate and a new 55 mm gun replaced it. The system used a centralised control system including both search and targeting radar, which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics, and then sent electrical commands to the guns, which used hydraulics to point themselves at high speeds. Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets. This system, modern even by today&#x27;s standards, was in late development when the war ended.

The British had already arranged licence building of the Bofors 40 mm, and introduced these into service. These had the power to knock down aircraft of any size, yet were light enough to be mobile and easily swung. The gun became so important to the British war effort that they even produced a movie, &quot;The Gun&quot;, that encouraged workers on the assembly line to work harder. The Imperial measurement production drawings the British had developed were supplied to the Americans who produced their own (unlicensed) copy of the 40 mm at the start of the war, moving to licensed production in mid-1941.

Service trials demonstrated another problem however: that ranging and tracking the new high-speed targets was almost impossible. At short range, the apparent target area is relatively large, the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short, allowing to correct lead by watching the tracers. At long range, the aircraft remains in firing range for a long time, so the necessary calculations can, in theory, be done by slide rules—though, because small errors in distance cause large errors in shell fall height and detonation time, exact ranging is crucial. For the ranges and speeds that the Bofors worked at, neither answer was good enough.

The solution was automation, in the form of a mechanical computer, the Kerrison Predictor. Operators kept it pointed at the target, and the Predictor then calculated the proper aim point automatically and displayed it as a pointer mounted on the gun. The gun operators simply followed the pointer and loaded the shells. The Kerrison was fairly simple, but it pointed the way to future generations that incorporated radar, first for ranging and later for tracking. Similar predictor systems were introduced by Germany during the war, also adding radar ranging as the war progressed.

A plethora of anti-aircraft gun systems of smaller calibre was available to the German Wehrmacht combined forces, and among them the 1940-origin &quot; Flakvierling&quot; quadruple-20 mm-autocannon-based anti-aircraft weapon system was one of the most often-seen weapons, seeing service on both land and sea. The similar Allied smaller-calibre air-defence weapons of the American forces were also quite capable. Their needs could cogently be met with smaller-calibre ordnance beyond using the usual singly-mounted M2 .50 caliber machine gun atop a tank&#x27;s turret, as four of the ground-used &quot;heavy barrel&quot; (M2HB) guns were mounted together on the American Maxson M45 Quadmount weapon (as a direct answer to the &quot;Flakvierling&quot;), which were often mounted on the back of a half-track to form the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage. Although of less power than Germany&#x27;s 20 mm systems, the typical four or five combat batteries of an Army AAA battalion were often spread many kilometres apart from each other, rapidly attaching and detaching to larger ground combat units to provide welcome defence from enemy aircraft.

AAA battalions were also used to help suppress ground targets. Their larger 90 mm M3 gun would prove, as did the eighty-eight, to make an excellent anti-tank gun as well, and was widely used late in the war in this role. Also available to the Americans at the start of the war was the 120 mm M1 gun &quot;stratosphere gun&quot;, which was the most powerful AA gun with an impressive altitude capability, however no 120 M1 was ever fired at an enemy aircraft. The 90 mm and 120 mm guns continued to be used into the 1950s.

The United States Navy had also put some thought into the problem, When the US Navy began to rearm in 1939 in many ships the primary short ranged gun was the M2 .50 caliber machine gun. While effective in fighters at 300 to 400 yards this is point blank range in naval anti-aircraft ranges. Production of the Swiss Oerlikon 20 mm had already started to provide protection for the British and this was adopted in exchange for the M2 machine guns. From December 1941 to January 1942, production had risen to not only cover all British requirements but also allowed 812 units to be actually delivered to the US Navy. By the end of 1942 the 20 mm had accounted for 42% of all aircraft destroyed by the US Navy&#x27;s shipboard AA. However, the King Board had noted that the balance was shifting towards the larger guns used by the fleet. The US Navy had intended to use the British pom-pom, however, the weapon required the use of cordite which BuOrd had found objectionable for US service. Further investigation revealed that US powders would not work in the pom-pom. Bureau of Ordnance was well aware of the Bofors 40 mm gun. The firm York Safe and Lock was negotiating with Bofors to attain the rights to the air-cooled version of the weapon. At the same time Henry Howard, an engineer, and businessman became aware of it and contacted RADM W. R. Furlong, chief of the Bureau of Ordnance. He ordered the Bofors weapon system to be investigated. York Safe and Lock would be used as the contracting agent. The system had to be redesigned for both the English measurement system and mass production, as the original documents recommended hand fitting parts and drilling to shape. As early as 1928 the US Navy saw the need to replace the .50 caliber machine gun with something heavier. The 1.1&quot;/75 (28 mm) Mark 1 was designed. Placed in quadruple mounts with a 500 rpm rate of fire it would have fit the requirements. However, the gun was suffering teething issues being prone to jamming. While this could have been solved the weight of the system was equal to that of the quad-mount Bofors 40 mm while lacking the range and power that the Bofors provided. The gun was relegated to smaller less vital ships by the end of the war. The 5&quot;/38 naval gun rounded out the US Navy&#x27;s AA suite. A dual purpose mount, it was used in both the surface and AA roles with great success. 
Mated with the Mark 37 director and the proximity fuse it could routinely knock drones out of the sky at ranges as far as 13,000 yards.A 3&quot;/50 MK 22 semiautomatic dual gun was produced but not employed before the end of the war and therefore beyond the scope of this article. However early marks of the 3&quot;/50 were employed in destroyer escorts and on merchant ships. 3″/50 caliber guns (Marks 10, 17, 18, and 20) first entered service in 1915 as a refit to , and were subsequently mounted on many types of ships as the need for anti-aircraft protection was recognized. During World War II, they were the primary gun armament on destroyer escorts, patrol frigates, submarine chasers, minesweepers, some fleet submarines, and other auxiliary vessels, and were used as a secondary dual-purpose battery on some other types of ships, including some older battleships. They also replaced the original low-angle 4&quot;/50 caliber guns (Mark 9) on &quot;flush-deck&quot; and s to provide better anti-aircraft protection. The gun was also used on specialist destroyer conversions; the &quot;AVD&quot; seaplane tender conversions received two guns; the &quot;APD&quot; high-speed transports, &quot;DM&quot; minelayers, and &quot;DMS&quot; minesweeper conversions received three guns, and those retaining destroyer classification received six.


The Germans developed massive reinforced-concrete blockhouses, some more than six stories high, which were known as &quot;Hochbunker&quot; &#x27;high bunkers&#x27; or &quot;&quot;Flaktürme&quot; flak towers, on which they placed anti-aircraft artillery. Those in cities attacked by the Allied land forces became fortresses. Several in Berlin were some of the last buildings to fall to the Soviets during the Battle of Berlin in 1945. The British built structures such as the Maunsell Forts in the North Sea, the Thames Estuary and other tidal areas upon which they based guns. After the war most were left to rot. Some were outside territorial waters, and had a second life in the 1960s as platforms for pirate radio stations, while another became the base of a micronation, the Principality of Sealand.

Some nations started rocket research before World War II, including for anti-aircraft use. Further research started during the war. The first step was unguided missile systems like the British 2-inch RP and 3-inch, which was fired in large numbers from &quot;Z batteries&quot;, and were also fitted to warships. The firing of one of these devices during an air raid is suspected to have caused the Bethnal Green disaster in 1943. Facing the threat of Japanese Kamikaze attacks the British and US developed surface-to-air rockets like British Fairey Stooge or the American Lark as counter measures, but none of them were ready at the end of the war. The Germans missile research was the most advanced of the war as the Germans put considerable effort in the research and development of rocket systems for all purposes. Among them were several guided and unguided systems. Unguided systems involved the Fliegerfaust (literally &quot;aircraft fist&quot;) rocket launcher as the first MANPADS. Guided systems were several sophisticated radio, wire, or radar guided missiles like the &quot;Wasserfall&quot; (&#x27;waterfall&#x27;) rocket. Owing to the severe war situation for Germany all of those systems were only produced in small numbers and most of them were only used by training or trial units.

Another aspect of anti-aircraft defence was the use of barrage balloons to act as physical obstacle initially to bomber aircraft over cities and later for ground attack aircraft over the Normandy invasion fleets. The balloon, a simple blimp tethered to the ground, worked in two ways. Firstly, it and the steel cable were a danger to any aircraft that tried to fly among them. Secondly, to avoid the balloons, bombers had to fly at a higher altitude, which was more favourable for the guns. Barrage balloons were limited in application, and had minimal success at bringing down aircraft, being largely immobile and passive defences.

The Allies&#x27; most advanced technologies were showcased by the anti-aircraft defence against the German V-1 cruise missiles (V stands for &quot;Vergeltungswaffe&quot;, &#x27;retaliation weapon&#x27;). The 419th and 601st anti-aircraft gun battalions of the US Army were first allocated to the Folkestone-Dover coast to defend London, and then moved to Belgium to become part of the &quot;Antwerp X&quot; project coordinated from the in Keerbergen. With the liberation of Antwerp, the port city immediately became the highest priority target, and received the largest number of V-1 and V-2 missiles of any city. The smallest tactical unit of the operation was a gun battery consisting of four 90 mm guns firing shells equipped with a radio proximity fuse. Incoming targets were acquired and automatically tracked by SCR-584 radar. Output from the gun-laying radar was fed to the M9 Gun Director, an electronic analogue computer to calculate the lead and elevation corrections for the guns. With the help of these three technologies, close to 90% of the V-1 missiles, on track to the defence zone around the port, were destroyed.

=== Post-war ===

Post-war analysis demonstrated that even with newest anti-aircraft systems employed by both sides, the vast majority of bombers reached their targets successfully, on the order of 90%. While these figures were undesirable during the war, the advent of the nuclear bomb considerably altered the acceptability of even a single bomber reaching its target.

The developments during World War II continued for a short time into the post-war period as well. In particular the US Army set up a huge air defence network around its larger cities based on radar-guided 90 mm and 120 mm guns. US efforts continued into the 1950s with the 75 mm Skysweeper system, an almost fully automated system including the radar, computers, power, and auto-loading gun on a single powered platform. The Skysweeper replaced all smaller guns then in use in the Army, notably the 40 mm Bofors. By 1955, the US military deemed the 40 mm Bofors obsolete due to its reduced capability to shoot down jet powered aircraft, and turned to SAM development, with the Nike Ajax and the RSD-58. In Europe NATO&#x27;s Allied Command Europe developed an integrated air defence system, NATO Air Defence Ground Environment (NADGE), that later became the NATO Integrated Air Defence System.

The introduction of the guided missile resulted in a significant shift in anti-aircraft strategy. Although Germany had been desperate to introduce anti-aircraft missile systems, none became operational during World War II. Following several years of post-war development, however, these systems began to mature into viable weapons. The US started an upgrade of their defences using the Nike Ajax missile, and soon the larger anti-aircraft guns disappeared. The same thing occurred in the USSR after the introduction of their SA-2 Guideline systems.

As this process continued, the missile found itself being used for more and more of the roles formerly filled by guns. First to go were the large weapons, replaced by equally large missile systems of much higher performance. Smaller missiles soon followed, eventually becoming small enough to be mounted on armoured cars and tank chassis. These started replacing, or at least supplanting, similar gun-based SPAAG systems in the 1960s, and by the 1990s had replaced almost all such systems in modern armies. Man-portable missiles, MANPADS, as they are known today, were introduced in the 1960s and have supplanted or replaced even the smallest guns in most advanced armies.

In the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentine armed forces deployed the newest west European weapons including the 35 mm Oerlikon GDF-002 twin cannon and Roland missile. The Rapier missile system was the primary GBAD system, used by both British artillery and RAF regiment, a few brand-new FIM-92 Stinger were used by British special forces. Both sides also used the Blowpipe missile. British naval missiles used included Sea Dart and the older Sea Slug longer range systems, SeaCat and the new Sea Wolf short range systems. Machine guns in AA mountings were used both ashore and afloat.

During the 2008 South Ossetia war air power faced off against powerful SAM systems, like the 1980s Buk-M1.

In February 2018, an Israeli F-16 fighter was downed in the occupied Golan Heights province, after it had attacked an Iranian target in Syria. In 2006, Israel also lost a helicopter over Lebanon, shot down by a Hezbollah rocket.

== AA warfare systems ==

Although the firearms used by the infantry, particularly machine guns, can be used to engage low altitude air targets, on occasion with notable success, their effectiveness is generally limited and the muzzle flashes reveal infantry positions. Speed and altitude of modern jet aircraft limit target opportunities, and critical systems may be armoured in aircraft designed for the ground attack role. Adaptations of the standard autocannon, originally intended for air-to-ground use, and heavier artillery systems were commonly used for most anti-aircraft gunnery, starting with standard pieces on new mountings, and evolving to specially designed guns with much higher performance prior to World War II.

The shells fired by these weapons are usually fitted with different types of fuses (barometric, time-delay, or proximity) to explode close to the airborne target, releasing a shower of fast metal fragments. For shorter-range work, a lighter weapon with a higher rate of fire is required, to increase a hit probability on a fast airborne target. Weapons between 20 mm and 40 mm calibre have been widely used in this role. Smaller weapons, typically .50 calibre or even 8 mm rifle calibre guns have been used in the smallest mounts.

Unlike the heavier guns, these smaller weapons are in widespread use due to their low cost and ability to quickly follow the target. Classic examples of autocannons and large calibre guns are the 40 mm autocannon from Bofors and the 8.8 cm FlaK 18, 36 gun designed by Krupp. Artillery weapons of this sort have for the most part been superseded by the effective surface-to-air missile systems that were introduced in the 1950s, although they were still retained by many nations. The development of surface-to-air missiles began in Nazi Germany during the late World War II with missiles such as the Wasserfall, though no working system was deployed before the war&#x27;s end, and represented new attempts to increase effectiveness of the anti-aircraft systems faced with growing threat from bombers. Land-based SAMs can be deployed from fixed installations or mobile launchers, either wheeled or tracked. The tracked vehicles are usually armoured vehicles specifically designed to carry SAMs.

Larger SAMs may be deployed in fixed launchers, but can be towed/re-deployed at will. The SAMs launched by individuals are known in the United States as the Man-Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS). MANPADS of the former Soviet Union have been exported around the World, and can be found in use by many armed forces. Targets for non-ManPAD SAMs will usually be acquired by air-search radar, then tracked before/while a SAM is &quot;locked-on&quot; and then fired. Potential targets, if they are military aircraft, will be identified as friend or foe before being engaged. The developments in the latest and relatively cheap short-range missiles have begun to replace autocannons in this role.
The interceptor aircraft (or simply interceptor) is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft, particularly bombers, usually relying on high speed and altitude capabilities. A number of jet interceptors such as the F-102 Delta Dagger, the F-106 Delta Dart, and the MiG-25 were built in the period starting after the end of World War II and ending in the late 1960s, when they became less important due to the shifting of the strategic bombing role to ICBMs. Invariably the type is differentiated from other fighter aircraft designs by higher speeds and shorter operating ranges, as well as much reduced ordnance payloads.

The radar systems use electromagnetic waves to identify the range, altitude, direction, or speed of aircraft and weather formations to provide tactical and operational warning and direction, primarily during defensive operations. In their functional roles they provide target search, threat detection, guidance, reconnaissance, navigation, instrumentation, and weather reporting support to combat operations.

=== Anti-UAV defences ===
An &quot;anti-UAV defence system&quot; (AUDS) is a system for defence against military unmanned aerial vehicles. A variety of designs have been developed, using lasers, net-guns and air-to-air netting, signal jamming, and hi-jacking by means of in-flight hacking. Anti-UAV defence systems have been deployed against ISIL drones during the Battle of Mosul (2016–2017).

Alternative approaches for dealing with UAVs have included using a shotgun at close range, and for smaller drones, training eagles to snatch them from the air. This only works on relatively small UAVs and loitering munitions (also called &quot;suicide drones&quot;). Larger UCAVs such as the MQ-1 Predator can be (and frequently are) shot down like manned aircraft of similar sizes and flight profiles.

=== Future developments ===
Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles, such as the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS, which uses the GAU-8 Avenger 30 mm seven-barrel Gatling gun for last ditch anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence. Even this formerly front-line weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems, such as the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile, which is smaller, faster, and allows for mid-flight course correction (guidance) to ensure a hit. To bridge the gap between guns and missiles, Russia in particular produces the Kashtan CIWS, which uses both guns and missiles for final defence with two six-barrelled 30 mm Gsh-6-30 rotary canon and eight 9M311 surface-to-air missiles provide for its defensive capabilities.

Upsetting this development to all-missile systems is the current move to stealth aircraft. Long range missiles depend on long-range detection to provide significant lead. Stealth designs cut detection ranges so much that the aircraft is often never even seen, and when it is, it is often too late for an intercept. Systems for detection and tracking of stealthy aircraft are a major problem for anti-aircraft development.

However, as stealth technology grows, so does anti-stealth technology. Multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and low-frequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft. Advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate QWIPs would be able to optically see a stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft&#x27;s radar cross-section (RCS). In addition, side-looking radars, high-powered optical satellites, and sky-scanning, high-aperture, high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes, would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters. The newest SAMs have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets, with the most notable being the Russian S-400, which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05-square metre RCS from 90 km away.

Another potential weapon system for anti-aircraft use is the laser. Although air planners have imagined lasers in combat since the late 1960s, only the most modern laser systems are currently reaching what could be considered &quot;experimental usefulness&quot;. In particular the Tactical High Energy Laser can be used in the anti-aircraft and anti-missile role. The ALKA directed-energy weapon (DEW) system is a Turkish dual electromagnetic/laser weapon developed by Roketsan allegedly used to destroy one of GNC&#x27;s Wing Loong II UAVs; if true, this would represent the first known time a vehicle mounted combat laser was used to destroy another combat vehicle during genuine wartime conditions.

The future of projectile based weapons may be found in the railgun. Currently tests are underway on developing systems that could create as much damage as a Tomahawk, but at a fraction of the cost. In February 2008 the US Navy tested a railgun; it fired a shell at per hour using 10 megajoules of energy. Its expected performance is over per hour muzzle velocity, accurate enough to hit a 5-metre target from away while shooting at 10 shots per minute. It is expected to be ready in 2020 to 2025. These systems, while currently designed for static targets, would only need the ability to be retargeted to become the next generation of AA system.

== Force structures ==

Most Western and Commonwealth militaries integrate air defence purely with the traditional services of the military (i.e. army, navy and air force), as a separate arm or as part of artillery. In the British Army for instance, air defence is part of the artillery arm, while in the Pakistan Army, it was split off from the artillery to form a separate arm of its own in 1990. This is in contrast to some (largely communist or ex-communist) countries where not only are there provisions for air defence in the army, navy and air force but there are specific branches that deal only with the air defence of territory, for example, the Soviet PVO Strany. The USSR also had a separate strategic rocket force in charge of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.

=== Navy ===

 Smaller boats and ships typically have machine-guns or fast cannons, which can often be deadly to low-flying aircraft if linked to a radar-directed fire-control system radar-controlled cannon for point defence. Some vessels like Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers are as much a threat to aircraft as any land-based air defence system. In general, naval vessels should be treated with respect by aircraft, however the reverse is equally true. Carrier battle groups are especially well defended, as not only do they typically consist of many vessels with heavy air defence armament but they are also able to launch fighter jets for combat air patrol overhead to intercept incoming airborne threats.

Nations such as Japan use their SAM-equipped vessels to create an outer air defence perimeter and radar picket in the defence of its Home islands, and the United States also uses its Aegis-equipped ships as part of its Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System in the defence of the Continental United States.

Some modern submarines, such as the Type 212 submarines of the German Navy, are equipped with surface-to-air missile systems, since helicopters and anti-submarine warfare aircraft are significant threats. The subsurface launched anti-air missile was first purposed by US Navy Rear Admiral Charles B. Momsen, in a 1953 article.

====Layered air defence====
Layered air defence in naval tactics, especially within a carrier group, is often built around a system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the centre. The outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier&#x27;s aircraft, specifically its AEW&amp;C aircraft combined with the CAP. If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer, then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by the carrier&#x27;s escorts; the area-defence missiles, such as the RIM-67 Standard, with a range of up to 100 nmi, and the point-defence missiles, like the RIM-162 ESSM, with a range of up to 30 nmi. Finally, virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns, including a CIWS, which is usually a radar-controlled Gatling gun of between 20 mm and 30 mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute.

=== Army ===

Armies typically have air defence in depth, from integral man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) such as the RBS 70, Stinger and Igla at smaller force levels up to army-level missile defence systems such as Angara and Patriot. Often, the high-altitude long-range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level, where anti-aircraft guns can bring them down. As well as the small and large systems, for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems. These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms, whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs), integrated air-defence systems like 2K22 Tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like Roland or SA-8 Gecko.

On a national level the United States Army was atypical in that it was primarily responsible for the missile air defences of the Continental United States with systems such as Project Nike.

=== Air force ===

Air defence by air forces is typically provided by fighter jets carrying air-to-air missiles. However, most air forces choose to augment airbase defence with surface-to-air missile systems as they are such valuable targets and subject to attack by enemy aircraft. In addition, some countries choose to put all air defence responsibilities under the air force.

=== Area air defence ===
Area air defence, the air defence of a specific area or location, (as opposed to point defence), have historically been operated by both armies (Anti-Aircraft Command in the British Army, for instance) and Air Forces (the United States Air Force&#x27;s CIM-10 Bomarc). Area defence systems have medium to long range and can be made up of various other systems and networked into an area defence system (in which case it may be made up of several short range systems combined to effectively cover an area). An example of area defence is the defence of Saudi Arabia and Israel by MIM-104 Patriot missile batteries during the first Gulf War, where the objective was to cover populated areas.

== Tactics ==

=== Mobility ===

Most modern air defence systems are fairly mobile. Even the larger systems tend to be mounted on trailers and are designed to be fairly quickly broken down or set up. In the past, this was not always the case. Early missile systems were cumbersome and required much infrastructure; many could not be moved at all. With the diversification of air defence there has been much more emphasis on mobility. Most modern systems are usually either self-propelled (i.e. guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis) or towed. Even systems that consist of many components (transporter/erector/launchers, radars, command posts etc.) benefit from being mounted on a fleet of vehicles. In general, a fixed system can be identified, attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in places where it is not expected. Soviet systems especially concentrate on mobility, after the lessons learnt in the Vietnam War between the US and Vietnam with the SA-2 Guideline.

=== Air defence versus air defence suppression ===

Many nations have developed significant tactics for air defence suppression. Dedicated weapons such as anti-radiation missiles and advanced electronics intelligence and electronic countermeasures platforms seek to suppress or negate the effectiveness of an opposing air-defence system. It is an arms race; as better jamming, countermeasures and anti-radiation weapons are developed, so are better SAM systems with ECCM capabilities and the ability to shoot down anti-radiation missiles and other munitions aimed at them or the targets they are defending.

===Insurgent tactics===
Stinger missiles supplied by the United States were used against the aircraft of the Soviet Union by the Afghan &quot;mujahideen&quot; during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the Cold War. Rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) can be—and often are—used against hovering helicopters (e.g., by Somali militiamen during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. Firing an RPG at steep angles poses a danger to the user, because the backblast from firing reflects off the ground. In Somalia, militia members sometimes welded a steel plate onto the exhaust end of an RPG&#x27;s tube to deflect pressure away from the shooter when shooting up at US helicopters. RPGs are used in this role only when more effective weapons are not available.

Another example of using RPGs against helicopters is Operation Anaconda in March 2002 in Afghanistan. Taliban insurgents defending Shah-i-Kot Valley used RPGs in a direct fire role against landing helicopters. Four rangers were killed when their helicopter was shot down by an RPG, and SEAL team member Neil C. Roberts fell out of his helicopter when it was hit by two RPGs. In other instances helicopters have been shot down in Afghanistan during a mission in Wardak province. One feature that makes RPGs useful in air defence is that they are fused to automatically detonate at 920 m. If aimed into the air this causes the warhead to airburst which can release a limited but potentially damaging amount of shrapnel hitting a helicopter landing or taking off.

For insurgents the most effective method of countering aircraft is to attempt to destroy them on the ground, either by penetrating an airbase perimeter and destroying aircraft individually, e.g. the September 2012 Camp Bastion raid, or finding a position where aircraft can be engaged with indirect fire, such as mortars. A recent trend emerging during the Syrian Civil War is the use of ATGM against landing helicopters.

<doc id="146641" wikidata="Q112670" url="?curid=146641" title="Mastocytosis">
<text>Mastocytosis, a type of mast cell disease, is a rare disorder affecting both children and adults caused by the accumulation of functionally defective mast cells (also called &quot;mastocytes&quot;) and CD34+ mast cell precursors.

People affected by mastocytosis are susceptible to a variety of symptoms, including itching, hives, and anaphylactic shock, caused by the release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory substances from mast cells.

== Signs and symptoms ==
When mast cells undergo degranulation, the substances that are released can cause a number of symptoms that can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe. Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They may include, but are not limited to
* Fatigue
* Skin lesions (&quot;urticaria pigmentosa&quot;), itching, and dermatographic &quot;urticaria&quot; (skin writing)
* &quot;Darier&#x27;s Sign&quot;, a reaction to stroking or scratching of urticaria lesions.
* Abdominal discomfort
* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Olfactive intolerance
* Ear/nose/throat inflammation
* Anaphylaxis (shock from allergic or immune causes)
* Episodes of very low blood pressure (including shock) and faintness
* Bone or muscle pain
* Decreased bone density or increased bone density (osteoporosis or osteosclerosis)
* Headache
* Depression
* Ocular discomfort
* Increased stomach acid production causing peptic ulcers (increased stimulation of enterochromaffin cell and direct histamine stimulation on parietal cell)
* Malabsorption (due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes by increased acid)
* Hepatosplenomegaly

There are few qualitative studies about the effects of mastocytosis on daily life. However, a Danish study from 2018 describes the multidimensional impact of the disease on everyday life.

== Pathophysiology ==
Mast cells are located in connective tissue, including the skin, the linings of the stomach and intestine, and other sites. They play an important role in the immune defence against bacteria and parasites. By releasing chemical &quot;alarms&quot; such as histamine, mast cells attract other key players of the immune defense system to areas of the body where they are needed.

Mast cells seem to have other roles as well. Because they gather together around wounds, mast cells may play a part in wound healing. For example, the typical itching felt around a healing scab may be caused by histamine released by mast cells. Researchers also think mast cells may have a role in the growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis). No one with &quot;too few&quot; or no mast cells has been found, which indicates to some scientists we may not be able to survive with too few mast cells.

Mast cells express a cell surface receptor, &quot;c-kit&quot; (CD117), which is the receptor for stem cell factor (&quot;scf&quot;). In laboratory studies, &quot;scf&quot; appears to be important for the proliferation of mast cells. Mutations of the gene coding for the &quot;c-kit&quot; receptor (mutation KIT(D816V)), leading to constitutive signalling through the receptor is found in &gt;90% of patients with systemic mastocytosis.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of &quot;urticaria pigmentosa&quot; (cutaneous mastocytosis, see above) can often be done by seeing the characteristic lesions that are dark brown and fixed. A small skin sample (biopsy) may help confirm the diagnosis.

In case of suspicion of systemic disease the level of serum tryptase in the blood can be of help. If the base level of s-tryptase is elevated, this implies that the mastocytosis can be systemic. In cases of suspicion of SM help can also be drawn from analysis of mutation in KIT(D816V) in peripheral blood using sensitive PCR-technology

To set the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis, certain criteria must be met. Either one major + one minor criterion or three minor criteria has to be fulfilled:

===Major criterion===
* Dense infiltrates of &gt;15 mast cells in the bone marrow or an extracutaneous organ

=== Minor criteria ===
* Aberrant phenotype on the mast cells (pos. for CD2 and/or CD25)
* Aberrant mast cell morphology (spindle-shaped)
* Finding of mutation in KIT(D816V)
* S-tryptase &gt;20 ng/ml

=== Other mast cell diseases ===
Other types of mast cell disease include:
* Monoclonal mast cell activation, defined by the World Health Organization definitions 2010, also has increased mast cells but insufficient to be systemic mastocytosis (in World Health Organization Definitions)
* Mast cell activation syndrome – has normal number of mast cells, but all the symptoms and in some cases the genetic markers of systemic mastocytosis
* Another known but rare mast cell proliferation disease is mast cell sarcoma.

=== Classification ===
Mastocytosis can occur in a variety of forms:

==== Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) ====
* The most common cutaneous mastocytosis is maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, previously named papular &quot;urticaria pigmentosa&quot; (UP), more common in children, although also seen in adults. &quot;Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans&quot; (TMEP) is a much rarer form of cutaneous mastocytosis that affects adults.[2] MPCM and TMEP can be a part of indolent systemic mastocytosis. This should be considered if patients develop any systemic symptoms
* Generalized eruption of cutaneous mastocytosis (adult type) is the most common pattern of mastocytosis presenting to the dermatologist, with the most common lesions being macules, papules, or nodules that are disseminated over most of the body but especially on the upper arms, legs, and trunk
* Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis has diffuse involvement in which the entire integument may be thickened and infiltrated with mast cells to produce a peculiar orange color, giving rise to the term &quot;homme orange&quot;.
Cutaneous mastocytosis in children usually presents in the first year after birth and in most cases vanishes during adolescence.

==== Systemic mastocytosis (SM) ====

Systemic mastocytosis involves the bone marrow in the majority of cases and in some cases other internal organs, usually in addition to involving the skin. Mast cells collect in various tissues and can affect organs where mast cells do not normally inhabit such as the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, and organs which have normal populations but where numbers are increased. In the bowel, it may manifest as mastocytic enterocolitis. However, normal ranges for mast cell counts in the gastrointestinal tract mucosa are not well established in the literature, and depend upon the exact location (e.g. right versus left colon), gender, and patient populations (such as asymptomatic patients versus patients with chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology). Quantitative mast cell stains may yield little diagnostic information, and further research studies are warranted to determine whether &quot;mastocytic enterocolitis&quot; truly represents a distinct entity.

There are five types of systemic mastocytosis:
* Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). The most common SM (&gt;90%)
* Smouldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM)
* Systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN)
* Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM)
* Mast cell leukemia (MCL)
== Treatment ==
There is no cure for mastocytosis, but there are a number of medicines to help treat the symptoms:

=== Anti-mediator therapy ===
* Antihistamines block receptors targeted by histamine released from mast cells. Both H1 and H2 blockers may be helpful, often in combination.
* Leukotriene antagonists block receptors targeted by leukotrienes released from mast cells.
* Mast cell stabilizers help prevent mast cells from releasing their chemical contents. Cromoglicic acid is the only medicine specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of mastocytosis. Ketotifen is available in Canada and Europe and more recently in the U.S. It is also available as eyedrops (Zaditor).
* Proton-pump inhibitors help reduce production of gastric acid, which is often increased in patients with mastocytosis. Excess gastric acid can harm the stomach, esophagus, and small intestine.
* Epinephrine constricts blood vessels and opens airways to maintain adequate circulation and ventilation when excessive mast cell degranulation has caused anaphylaxis.
* Salbutamol and other beta-2 agonists open airways that can constrict in the presence of histamine.
* Corticosteroids can be used topically, inhaled, or systemically to reduce inflammation associated with mastocytosis.
* Drugs to prevent/treat osteoporosis include Calcium-Vitamine D, bisphosphonates and in rare cases inhibitors of RANK-L

Antidepressants are an important and often overlooked tool in the treatment of mastocytosis. Depression and other neurological symptoms have been noted in mastocytosis. Some antidepressants, such as doxepin and mirtazapine, are themselves potent antihistamines and can help relieve physical as well as cognitive symptoms.

=== Cytoreductive therapy ===
In cases of advanced systemic mastocytosis or rare cases with indolent systemic mastocytosis with very troublesome symptoms, cytoreductive therapy can be indicated.
* ɑ-interferon. Given as subcutaneous injections. Side effects include fatigue and influenza-like symptoms
* Cladribine (CdA). Chemotherapy which is given as subcutaneous injections. Side effects include immunodeficiency and infections.
* Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
** Midostaurin. TKI acting on many different tyrosine kinases, approved by FDA and EMA for advanced mastocytosis
** Imatinib. Can have effect in rare cases without mutation in KIT(D816V)
** Masitinib. Is being tested in trials. Not approved.
** Midostaurin - 60% respond.
** Avapritinib in trials; currently being tested but showing promise in reduction of tryptase levels.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been used in rare cases with aggressive systemic mastocytosis in patients deemed to be fit for the procedure.

=== Other ===
Treatment with ultraviolet light can relieve skin symptoms, but may increase the risk of skin cancer.

== Prognosis ==
Patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis have a normal life expectancy. The prognosis for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis differs depending on type of disease with MCL being the most serious form with short survival.

== Epidemiology ==
The true incidence and prevalence of mastocytosis is unknown, but mastocytosis generally has been considered to be an &quot;orphan disease&quot;; orphan diseases affect 200,000 or fewer people in the United States. Mastocytosis, however, often may be misdiagnosed, as it typically occurs secondary to another condition, and thus may occur more frequently than assumed.

==Research==
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases scientists have been studying and treating patients with mastocytosis for several years at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center.

Some of the most important research advances for this rare disorder include improved diagnosis of mast cell disease and identification of growth factors and genetic mechanisms responsible for increased mast cell production. Researchers are currently evaluating approaches to improve ways to treat mastocytosis.

Scientists also are focusing on identifying disease-associated mutations (changes in genes). NIH scientists have identified some mutations, which may help researchers understand the causes of mastocytosis, improve diagnosis, and develop better treatments.

In Europe the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) coordinates studies, registries and education on mastocytosis.

== History ==
&quot;Urticaria pigmentosa&quot; was first described in 1869. The first report of a primary mast cell disorder is attributed to Unna, who in 1887 reported that skin lesions of &quot;urticaria pigmentosa&quot; contained numerous mast cells. Systemic mastocytosis was first reported by French scientists in 1936.

<doc id="146642" wikidata="Q497232" url="?curid=146642" title="Coronary circulation">
<text>Coronary circulation is the circulation of blood in the arteries and veins that supply the heart muscle (myocardium).

Coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. Cardiac veins then drain away the blood after it has been deoxygenated.

Because the rest of the body, and most especially the brain, needs a steady supply of oxygenated blood that is free of all but the slightest interruptions, the heart is required to function continuously. Therefore its circulation is of major importance not only to its own tissues but to the entire body and even the level of consciousness of the brain from moment to moment.

Interruptions of coronary circulation quickly cause heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), in which the heart muscle is damaged by oxygen starvation. Such interruptions are usually caused by coronary ischemia linked to coronary artery disease, and sometimes to embolism from other causes like obstruction in blood flow through vessels.

==Structure==
===Coronary arteries===
Coronary arteries supply blood to the myocardium and other components of the heart. Two coronary arteries originate from the left side of the heart at the beginning (root) left ventricle. There are three aortic sinuses (dilations) in the wall of the aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve. Two of these, the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic sinus, give rise to the left and right coronary arteries, respectively. The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus, typically does not give rise to a vessel. Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the heart and follow the sulci of the heart are called &quot;epicardial&quot; coronary arteries.

The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the interventricular septum. The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to the left. Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The larger left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary artery. It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the way it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses. An anastomosis is an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally allow blood to circulate to a region even if there may be partial blockage in another branch. The anastomoses in the heart are very small. Therefore, this ability is somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in myocardial infarction causing death of the cells supplied by the particular vessel.

The right coronary artery proceeds along the coronary sulcus and distributes blood to the right atrium, portions of both ventricles, and the heart conduction system. Normally, one or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary artery inferior to the right atrium. The marginal arteries supply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle. On the posterior surface of the heart, the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior interventricular artery, also known as the posterior descending artery. It runs along the posterior portion of the interventricular sulcus toward the apex of the heart, giving rise to branches that supply the interventricular septum and portions of both ventricles.

===Cardiac veins===

The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are the cardiac veins. These include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the smallest cardiac veins, and the anterior cardiac veins. Cardiac veins carry blood with a poor level of oxygen, from the myocardium to the right atrium. Most of the blood of the coronary veins returns through the coronary sinus. The anatomy of the veins of the heart is very variable, but generally it is formed by the following veins: heart veins that go into the coronary sinus: the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, and the oblique vein of Marshall. Heart veins that go directly to the right atrium: the anterior cardiac veins, the smallest cardiac veins (Thebesian veins).

===Anastomoses===

There are some anastomoses between branches of the two coronary arteries. However the coronary arteries are functionally end arteries and so these meetings are referred to as potential anastomoses, which lack function, as opposed to true anastomoses like that in the palm of the hand. This is because blockage of one coronary artery generally results in death of the heart tissue due to lack of sufficient blood supply from the other branch. When two arteries or their branches join, the area of the myocardium receives dual blood supply. These junctions are called anastomoses. If one coronary artery is obstructed by an atheroma, the second artery is still able to supply oxygenated blood to the myocardium. However, this can only occur if the atheroma progresses slowly, giving the anastomoses a chance to proliferate.

Under the most common configuration of coronary arteries, there are three areas of anastomoses. Small branches of the LAD (left anterior descending/anterior interventricular) branch of the left coronary join with branches of the posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary in the interventricular sulcus (groove). More superiorly, there is an anastomosis between the circumflex artery (a branch of the left coronary artery) and the right coronary artery in the atrioventricular groove. There is also an anastomosis between the septal branches of the two coronary arteries in the interventricular septum. The photograph shows area of heart supplied by the right and the left coronary arteries.

===Variation===
The left and right coronary arteries occasionally arise by a common trunk, or their number may be increased to three; the additional branch being the posterior coronary artery (which is smaller in size). In rare cases, a person will have the third coronary artery run around the root of the aorta.

Occasionally, a coronary artery will exist as a double structure (i.e. there are two arteries, parallel to each other, where ordinarily there would be one).

====Coronary artery dominance====
The artery that supplies the posterior third of the interventricular septum – the posterior descending artery (PDA) determines the coronary dominance.
* If the posterior descending artery is supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA), then the coronary circulation can be classified as &quot;right-dominant.&quot;
* If the posterior descending artery is supplied by the circumflex artery (CX), a branch of the left artery, then the coronary circulation can be classified as &quot;left-dominant.&quot;
* If the posterior descending artery is supplied by both the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery, then the coronary circulation can be classified as &quot;co-dominant.&quot;

Approximately 70% of the general population are right-dominant, 20% are co-dominant, and 10% are left-dominant.
A precise anatomic definition of dominance would be the artery which gives off supply to the AV node i.e. the AV nodal artery. Most of the time this is the right coronary artery.

==Function==

===Supply to papillary muscles===
The papillary muscles attach the mitral valve (the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle) and the tricuspid valve (the valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle) to the wall of the heart. If the papillary muscles are not functioning properly, the mitral valve may leak during contraction of the left ventricle. This causes some of the blood to travel &quot;in reverse&quot;, from the left ventricle to the left atrium, instead of forward to the aorta and the rest of the body. This leaking of blood to the left atrium is known as mitral regurgitation. Similarly, the leaking of blood from the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve and into the right atrium can also occur, and this is described as tricuspid insufficiency or tricuspid regurgitation.

The anterolateral papillary muscle more frequently receives two blood supplies: left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the left circumflex artery (LCX).
It is therefore more frequently resistant to coronary ischemia (insufficiency of oxygen-rich blood). On the other hand, the posteromedial papillary muscle is usually supplied only by the PDA. This makes the posteromedial papillary muscle significantly more susceptible to ischemia. The clinical significance of this is that a myocardial infarction involving the PDA is more likely to cause mitral regurgitation.

===Changes in diastole===
During contraction of the ventricular myocardium (systole), the subendocardial coronary vessels (the vessels that enter the myocardium) are compressed due to the high ventricular pressures.
This compression results in momentary retrograde blood flow (i.e., blood flows backward toward the aorta) which further inhibits perfusion of myocardium during systole.
However, the epicardial coronary vessels (the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) remain open.
Because of this, blood flow in the subendocardium stops during ventricular contraction.
As a result, most myocardial perfusion occurs during heart relaxation (diastole) when the subendocardial coronary vessels are open and under lower pressure.
Flow never comes to zero in the right coronary artery, since the right ventricular pressure is less than the diastolic blood pressure.

===Changes in oxygen demand===
The heart regulates the amount of vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries based upon the oxygen requirements of the heart. This contributes to the filling difficulties of the coronary arteries.
Compression remains the same. Failure of oxygen delivery caused by a decrease in blood flow in front of increased oxygen demand of the heart results in tissue ischemia, a condition of oxygen deficiency. Brief ischemia is associated with intense chest pain, known as angina. Severe ischemia can cause the heart muscle to die from hypoxia, such as during a myocardial infarction. Chronic moderate ischemia causes contraction of the heart to weaken, known as myocardial hibernation.

In addition to metabolism, the coronary circulation possesses unique pharmacologic characteristics. Prominent among these is its reactivity to adrenergic stimulation.

==Branches==
The following are the named branches of the coronary circulation in a right-dominant heart:
* Aorta
** Left coronary artery / Left main coronary artery (LMCA)
*** Left circumflex artery (LCX)
**** Obtuse marginal artery #1 (OM1)
**** Obtuse marginal artery #2 (OM2)
*** Left anterior descending artery (LAD)
**** Diagonal artery #1
**** Diagonal artery #2
** Right coronary artery (RCA)
*** Atrioventricular nodal branch
*** Right marginal artery
*** Posterior descending artery (PDA)
*** Posteriolateral artery #1 (PL#1)
*** Posteriolateral artery #2 (PL#2)

== Clinical significance ==
The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium are the coronary arteries. When the arteries are healthy, they are capable of autoregulating themselves to maintain the coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the heart muscle. 

The relatively narrow coronary arteries are commonly affected by atherosclerosis and can become blocked, causing angina or a heart attack. The coronary arteries are classified as &quot;terminal circulation&quot;, since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium; there is very little redundant blood supply, that is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical.

<text>A ring current is an electric current carried by charged particles trapped in a planet&#x27;s magnetosphere. It is caused by the longitudinal drift of energetic (10–200 keV) particles.

==Earth&#x27;s ring current==

Earth&#x27;s ring current is responsible for shielding the lower latitudes of the Earth from magnetospheric electric fields. It therefore has a large effect on the electrodynamics of geomagnetic storms. The ring current system consists of a band, at a distance of 3 to 8 &quot;R&quot;E, which lies in the equatorial plane and circulates clockwise around the Earth (when viewed from the north). The particles of this region produce a magnetic field in opposition to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and so an Earthly observer would observe a decrease in the magnetic field in this area. The negative deflection of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field due to the ring current is measured by the Dst index.

The ring current energy is mainly carried around by the ions, most of which are protons. However, one also sees alpha particles in the ring current, a type of ion that is plentiful in the solar wind. In addition, a certain percentage are O+ oxygen ions, similar to those in the ionosphere of Earth, though much more energetic. This mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source.

==The ring current and geomagnetic storms==

During a geomagnetic storm, the number of particles in the ring current will increase. As a result, there is a decrease in the effects of geomagnetic field.

<text>Historical reenactment(or re-enactment) is an educational or entertainment activity in which mainly amateur hobbyists and history enthusiasts dress in historical uniforms and follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as a reenactment of Pickett&#x27;s Charge presented during the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, or as broad as an entire period, such as Regency reenactment.

While historical reenactors are generally amateurs, some participants are military personnel or historians. The participants, called &quot;reenactors&quot;, often research the equipment, uniform, and other gear they will carry or use. Reenactors buy the apparel or items they need from specialty stores or make items themselves. Historical reenactments cover a wide span of history, from as far back as ancient warfare, the medieval warfare era, and the early modern warfare, to as recent as the World Wars, the Cold War era, and even the early 21st century modern warfare.
==History==

Activities related to &quot;reenactment&quot; have a long history. The Romans staged recreations of famous battles within their amphitheaters as a form of public spectacle. In the Middle Ages, tournaments often reenacted historical themes from Ancient Rome or elsewhere. Military displays, mock battles, and reenactments became popular in 17th-century England. 

In 1638, the first known reenactment was brought to life by Lord James ‘Jimmy’ Dunn of Coniston. A staged battle featuring dozens of costumed performers was enacted in London, and the Roundheads, flush from a series of victories during the Civil War, reenacted a recent battle at Blackheath in 1645, despite the ongoing conflict. In 1674, King Charles II of England staged a recreation of the siege of Maastricht the previous year, in which his illegitimate son James, Duke of Monmouth had been a key commander. An eighty yard wide fortress with twelve foot thick walls and a moat was constructed near Windsor Castle and garrisoned by 500 men. 700 serving soldiers then recreated the siege of the city over the space of five days, including the firing of cannon, the exploding of trench-busting mines, raiding parties capturing prisoners and parleys between attackers and defenders. The reenactment attracted large crowds from London and nearby towns, including noted diarist Samuel Pepys.

In the nineteenth century, historical reenactments became widespread, reflecting the then intense Romantic interest in the Middle Ages. Medieval culture was widely admired as an antidote to the modern enlightenment and industrial age. Plays and theatrical works (such as &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, which in 1820 was playing in six different productions in London alone) perpetuated the romanticism of knights, castles, feasts, and tournaments. The Duke of Buckingham staged naval battles from the Napoleonic Wars on the large lake on his estate in 1821 and a reenactment of the Battle of Waterloo was put on for public viewing at Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre in 1824.

Historical reenactment came of age with the grand spectacle of the Eglinton Tournament of 1839, a reenactment of a medieval joust and revel held in Scotland, and organized by Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton. The Tournament was a deliberate act of Romanticism and drew 100,000 spectators. The ground chosen for the tournament was low, almost marshy, with grassy slopes rising on all sides. Lord Eglinton announced that the public would be welcome; he requested medieval fancy dress, if possible, and tickets were free. The pageant itself featured thirteen medieval knights on horseback.

It was held on a meadow at a loop in the Lugton Water. The preparations and the many works of art commissioned for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament affected public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as a similar lavish tournament in Brussels in 1905 and presaged the historical reenactments of the present. Features of the tournament were inspired by Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;: it was attempting &quot;to be a living reenactment of the literary romances&quot;. In Eglinton&#x27;s own words &quot;I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition—more perhaps than those who were not so deeply interested in it; I am aware that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry&quot;.

Reenactments of battles became more commonplace in the late 19th century, both in Britain and America. Within a year of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, survivors of U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment reenacted the scene of their defeat for the camera as a series of still poses. In 1895, members of the Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers reenacted their famous last stand at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, 18 years earlier. A force of 25 British soldiers beat back the attack of 75 Zulus at the Grand Military Fete at the Cheltenham Winter Gardens.
Veterans of the American Civil War recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett&#x27;s Charge.

During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in Russia with reenactments of the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) (1906), the Battle of Borodino (1812) in St Petersburg and the &quot;Taking of Azov&quot; (1696) in Voronezh in 1918. In 1920, the 1917 &quot;Storming of the Winter Palace&quot; was reenacted on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;.

Large-scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the Siege of Namur, a critical military engagement of the Nine Years&#x27; War, was staged in 1934 as part of a 6-day long show.

In the United States, modern reenacting began during the 1961–1965 Civil War Centennial commemorations. After more than 6,000 reenactors participated in a 125th anniversary event near the original Manassas battlefield, reenacting grew in popularity during the late 1980s and 1990s, and there are today over a hundred Civil War reenactments held each year throughout the country.

==Reenactors==

Most participants are amateurs who pursue history as a hobby. Participants within this hobby are diverse, ranging in age from young children whose parents bring them along to events, to the elderly. In addition to hobbyists, members of the armed forces and professional historians sometimes participate.

===Categories of reenactors===
Reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divided) into several broadly defined categories, based on the level of concern for authenticity.

These definitions and categorization are primarily those of American Civil War reenactments; other countries&#x27; reenactment communities have different terms of art, slang, and definitions.

====Farbs====

&quot;Farbs&quot; or &quot;polyester soldiers&quot;, are reenactors who spend relatively little time and/or money achieving authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or period behavior. Anachronistic clothing, fabrics, fasteners (such as velcro), headwear, footwear, vehicles, and consumables (such as modern cigarettes) are common.

The origin of the word &quot;farb&quot; (and the derivative adjective &quot;farby&quot;) is unknown, though it appears to date to early American Civil War centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961. Some think that the word derives from a truncated version of &quot;Far be it from authentic&quot;. An alternative definition is &quot;Far Be it for me to question/criticise&quot;, or &quot;Fast And Researchless Buying&quot;. A humorous definition of &quot;farb&quot; is &quot;F.A.R.B: Forget About Research, Baby&quot;. Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German &quot;Farbe&quot;, color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined. According to Burton K. Kummerow, a member of &quot;The Black Hats, CSA&quot; reenactment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors since.

====Mainstream====

Mainstream reenactors make an effort to appear authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the period, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items are sometimes used &quot;after hours&quot; or in a hidden fashion.

====Progressive====

At the other extreme from farbs are &quot;hardcore authentics&quot;, or &quot;progressives&quot;, as they sometimes prefer to be called; derisively, they are sometimes called &quot;stitch counters&quot;, &quot;stitch nazis&quot;, or &quot;stitch witches.&quot; The movement is &quot;often misunderstood and sometimes maligned.&quot;

Hardcore reenactors value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate &quot;reenactorisms&quot;. They generally seek an &quot;immersive&quot; reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the period might have done. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event. The desire for an immersive experience often leads hard-core reenactors to smaller events, or to setting up separate camps at larger events.

==Period==

The period of an event is the range of dates. The period reenacted affects the types of costume, weapons, and armour used.

Common periods to reenact include:
* Ancient reenactment
* Dark Ages reenactment
* Medieval reenactment
* Renaissance reenactment
* Modern reenactment
* Regency reenactment
* Fur trade reenactment
* American Civil War reenactment
* World War I reenactment
* World War II reenactment
* Korean War reenactment

==Types==
===Living history===
The term &quot;living history&quot; describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a manner that in most cases is not following a planned script. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at living history museums can be blurred. While the latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events.

Living histories are usually meant for education of the public. Such events do not necessarily have a mock battle but instead are aimed at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

There are different styles of living history, each with its own fidelity to the past. &quot;Third-person&quot; interpreters take on the dress and work in a particular period style, but do not take on personas of past people; by taking this style, they emphasize to audiences the differences between past and present. &quot;Second-person&quot; interpreters take on historical personae to an extent, engaging audiences to participate in period activities, such as soap-making or churning butter, thus restaging historical episodes with their spectators. Finally, &quot;First-person&quot; interpreters &quot;feign previous folk &#x27;from outward appearances to innermost beliefs and attitudes,&#x27; pretending not to know anything of events past their epoch, and engaging with audiences using antiquated dialects and mannerisms.

In the United States, the National Park Service does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property; however, there are exceptions, such as Sayde or the Schloss Kaltenberg knights tournament. The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity. The specific German approach of authenticity is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain era, to catch, in the sense of Walter Benjamin the &quot;spiritual message expressed in every monument&#x27;s and every site&#x27;s own &#x27;trace&#x27; and &#x27;aura, even in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities. Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but serve as staffage for the immersion experience. In Denmark several open air museums uses living history as a part of their concept. These include Middelaldercentret, The Old Town, Aarhus and Frilandsmuseet.

===Combat demonstration===

Combat demonstrations are mock battles put on by reenacting organizations and/or private parties primarily to show the public what combat in the period might have been like. Combat demonstrations are only loosely based on actual battles, if at all, and may simply consist of demonstrations of basic tactics and maneuvering techniques.

===Battle reenactment===
Scripted battles are reenactments in the strictest sense; the battles are planned out beforehand so that the companies and regiments make the same actions that were taken in the original battles. The mock battles are often &quot;fought&quot; at or near the original battle ground or at a place very similar to the original. These demonstrations vary widely in size from a few hundred fighters to several thousand, as do the arenas used (getting the right balance can often make or break the spectacle for the public).

===Tactical combat===
Unlike battle reenactments, tactical battle events are generally not open to the public. Tactical battle scenarios are games in which both sides come up with strategies and maneuvering tactics to beat their opponents. With no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and on-site judges, tactical battles can be considered a form of live action role-playing game or wargame. If firearms are used, any real weapons fire blank ammunition (depending on gun control ordinances), though airsoft guns are becoming more common.

Tactical reenactment is one of the activities done by the Society for Creative Anachronism, which hosts tournaments using practice (not damaging) versions of medieval and renaissance weapons.

===Commercial reenactment===
Many castles that offer tours, museums, and other historical tourist attractions employ actors or professional reenactors to add to authentic feel and experience. These reenactors usually recreate part of a specific town, village, or activity within a certain time frame. Commercial reenactment shows are usually choreographed and follow a script. Some locations have set up permanent authentic displays. By their nature, these are usually living history presentations, rather than tactical or battle reenactment, although some host larger temporary events.

In 2008, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve and North Carolina&#x27;s Tryon Palace staff and buildings provided the period backdrop for early 1800s life depicted in the &quot;Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck&quot; documentary.

==Publications==
Many publications have covered historical reenactment and living history. Prominent among these are the &quot;Camp Chase Gazette&quot;, &quot;Smoke and Fire News,&quot; and two different magazines named &quot;Living History&quot;, and &quot;Skirmish Magazine&quot;.

&quot;The Medieval Soldier&quot; by Gerry Embleton and John Howe (1995) is a popular book on the topic, which has been translated into French and German. It was followed by &quot;Medieval Military Costume in Colour Photographs&quot;.

For the Napoleonic period, two books of interest cover life in the military at that time and living history: &quot;The Napoleonic Soldier&quot; by Stephen E. Maughan (1999) and &quot;Marching with Sharpe&quot; by B. J. Bluth (2001). Various Napoleonic reenactment groups cover the history of their associated regiments as well as try to describe and illustrate how they approach recreating the period. The goal to be as authentic as is possible has led many serious reenactment societies to set up their own research groups to verify their knowledge of the uniforms, drill and all aspects of the life that they strive to portray. In this way reenactment plays a vital role in bringing history to life, keeping history alive, and in expanding the knowledge and understanding of the period.

In the UK a number of small publishing houses have been established that particularly publish books about the English Civil War and earlier periods. The largest are Stuart Press (with around 250 volumes in print) and Partizan Press.

Little has been published about reenactment in the mainstream market, except for press articles. One exception is the book &quot;I Believe in Yesterday: My Adventures in Living History&quot; by Tim Moore, which recounts his experiences trying out different periods of reenactment, the people he meets, and things he learns whilst doing so.

==Media support==
Motion picture and television producers often turn to reenactment groups for support; films like &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, &quot;The Patriot&quot;, and &quot;Alatriste&quot; benefited greatly from the input of reenactors, who arrived on set fully equipped and steeped in knowledge of military procedures, camp life, and tactics.

In a documentary about the making of the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, actor Sam Elliott, who portrayed Union General John Buford in the film, said of reenactors:

== Academic reception ==

Historians&#x27; perspectives on the genre of historical reenactment is mixed. On the one hand, some historians cite reenactment as a way for ordinary people to understand and engage with the narratives about the past in ways that academic history fails to do—namely, that it presents straightforward and entertaining narratives, and allows people to more fully &quot;embody&quot; the past. Rather than confining the production of historical narratives to academia, some argue that this &quot;history from below&quot; provides an important public service to educating the public about past events, serving to &quot;enliven history for millions who turn a blind or bored eye on monuments and museums.&quot;

Other historians critique the anachronisms present in reenactment and cite the impossibility of truly retrieving and reproducing the past from the vantage point of the present; &quot;We are not past but present people, with experience, knowledge, feelings, and aims previously unknown,&quot; writes Lowenthal, and however impeccably we attempt to bring back the past, everything is filtered through our modern lens and senses. Further, others worry that the focus on historical accuracy in the details, such as dress, obscure the broader historical themes that are critical for audiences to understand; this worry is more acute for certain forms of reenactment, such as American Civil War reenactment, that elicit strong feelings and have real impacts in the present-day world. By focusing on the accuracy of details, some worry, the discussion of the war&#x27;s causes, such as the end of slavery, are confined to the margins.

Further, under the guise of adhering to the past, some worry, the true, underlying purposes of some reenactments can be obscured; namely, that some reenactors defend not only their prescribed side, but also their side&#x27;s beliefs: as one reenactor put it, &quot;I do this because I believe in what they believed in... The real pure hobby is not just looking right; it&#x27;s thinking right.&quot; In response to this, some historians call for a more &quot;authentic&quot; approach to presenting the past, wherein the impacts of that representation on present-day society are honestly presented so as not to give an inaccurate picture of the past. &quot;Historical authenticity resides not in fidelity to an alleged past&quot;, cautions an anthropologist, but in being honest about how the present represents that past.&quot;

==Criticism==

There are a number of criticisms made about reenactment. Many point out that the average age of reenactors is generally far higher than the average age of soldiers in most conflicts. Few reenactment units discriminate based on age and physical condition.

In the United States, reenactors are overwhelmingly white. In Civil War reenactments, African-American characters, both enslaved and free, are underrepresented. In 2013, five black reenactors at the 150th anniversary event at Gettysburg constituted &quot;the largest bloc of black civilians anyone had ever seen at an event whose historical basis was full of black civilians... Astonished spectators stopped them constantly, usually assuming they were portraying enslaved people.&quot;

Jenny Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;Wargames&quot; discusses the &quot;fantasy farb&quot;, or tendency of reenactors to gravitate towards &quot;elite&quot; units such as commandos, paratroopers, or Waffen-SS units. This results in under-representation in the reenactment community of what were the most common types of military troops in the period being reenacted. The question has arisen among North American reenactors, but similar issues exist in Europe. For example, in Britain, a high proportion of Napoleonic War reenactors perform as members of the 95th Rifles (perhaps due to the popularity of the fictional character of Richard Sharpe), and medieval groups have an over-proportion of plate-armoured soldiers.

Some veterans have criticized military reenactment as glorifying &quot;what is literally a human tragedy&quot;, with one World War II veteran remarking in 1988, &quot;If they knew what a war was like, they&#x27;d never play at it.&quot;

Some feminist critiques of certain kinds of reenactment, such as Civil War reenactment, &quot;builds up a prosthetic symbolic male white body, embedded in an archaic racialized gender system: the clothing and the tools normally intensify male whiteness. Thus, even if the outer appearance of the uniformed female reenactor is flawless, her participation is deemed unacceptable by most male reenactors.&quot; Some reenactments more recently have allowed women to participate as combatants as long as their appearance can pass as male from a specified distance.

Reenactors may be accused of being, or actually be, aligned with the political beliefs that some of the reenacted armies fought for, such as Nazism or the Confederate South. For example, U.S. politician Rich Iott participation in a World War II reenactment in which he was in the group that portrayed the German 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking side excited media criticism during his 2010 Congressional campaign. Similar accusations have been made against Igor Girkin, a Russian reenactor who has led Russian-aligned forces in the Russo-Ukrainian War. In 2017, in the weeks following a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia at which a neo-Nazi killed a counterprotester, some reenactors complained about—as one reporter put it—&quot;the co-opting of the [Civil] war by neo-Nazis.&quot;

William McDougall was born near York, Upper Canada (now Toronto, Ontario) to Daniel McDougall and Hannah Matthews. William was the third generation of United Empire Loyalists to settle in York. In 1793, his paternal great-great-grandparents were among the first twelve families to move to York along with 450 British troops. Those soldiers then built Fort York to protect against American invasion.

McDougall received his education at Victoria College in Cobourg, Upper Canada, and in 1847, began practicing law as an attorney and solicitor in Upper Canada. In 1862, he was called to the Upper Canada Bar.

In 1849, William McDougall&#x27;s office in Toronto was the meeting place for the Clear Grit political movement. Other Clear Grit supporters included Peter Perry, David Christie, Charles Clarke, Charles Lindsey, and Malcolm Cameron. From 1850 to 1858, he published &quot;The North American&quot;, a liberal newspaper.

He was elected as a member of the legislative assembly in 1858 and was Commissioner of Crown Lands and Provincial Secretary.

=== Gettysburg Address ===
In 1863, along with Alexander Tilloch Galt, McDougall went to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Abraham Lincoln in order to renegotiate the Reciprocity Treaty. During the visit, Lincoln explained that he had an important event to attend and had to travel to Pennsylvania. The president had then invited McDougall to accompany him on his trip by train and coach. They stayed the night at the private home of David Wills, a wealthy 32-year-old Gettysburg attorney.

On the following day, November 19, an opening ceremony took place at the new Gettysburg cemetery, built for dead soldiers of the American Civil War. While many orators spoke for hours, Lincoln spoke briefly, presenting the Gettysburg Address.

In July 1958, before then–US President Dwight D. Eisenhower addressed a joint session of the Parliament of Canada, Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker recounted the tale of the friendship between McDougall and Lincoln as an example of the long history of friendship between Canada and the United States. A copy of the &quot;Hansard&quot; containing Eisenhower&#x27;s speech was autographed and commented by Diefenbaker, and it can be found in the Baldwin Rooma secured archives areaof the Toronto Reference Library.

=== Confederation Canada ===
McDougall is considered a father of Canadian confederation as he attended all three Confederation conferences. Once the dominion formed, he was Minister of Public Works in the Macdonald government. As he had begun as Liberal and now served under Macdonald&#x27;s Conservatives, he earned the nickname &#x27;Wandering Willy&#x27;.

In the federal election of 1867 he was elected in the district of Lanark North, for the Liberal-Conservative party.

McDougall was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory in 1869. The only practicable travel route at the time was through the United States with the permission of U.S. President Grant. However, when McDougall tried to enter Rupert&#x27;s Land from the Dakota Territory down the Red River, he was turned back near the border by Louis Riel&#x27;s troops before he could establish his authority at Fort Garry (now Winnipeg, Manitoba). Dispatches on microfiche at the Main Library of the City of Toronto include his request for 1,000 British troops to be sent on the authority of Queen Victoria. She responded that she would prefer a more amicable settlement of the jurisdiction issue. He returned to Ottawa, and campaigned against Manitoba becoming a province because of its very few inhabitants at that time. The area of Fort Garry was about . He also continued to be an interim leader of the North-West provisional government from Ottawa until Adams George Archibald took over on May 10, 1870.

In the federal election of 1872, he ran again for the Liberal-Conservative party in Lanark North but was defeated. In 1875, he was elected to the Parliament of the Province of Ontario. He was an Independent-Liberal from June 1, 1875, until September 9, 1878, for the electoral district of Simcoe South.

=== Second marriage and family ===

In November 1872, McDougall married his second wife, Mary Adelaide Beatty. She was the daughter of Eleanor and Dr. John Beatty, a professor in Victoria University. She was born and educated at Cobourg, Ontario. Mary was involved in various philanthropic organizations including the Ottawa Humane Society. The couple lived at 407 Wilbrod Street, Ottawa. The couple had three sons, two of whom served with the Canadian contingent during the Boer War in South Africa.

His sister Emily married Liberal Senator David Reesor in 1847.

=== Later life and death ===
In the federal election of 1878, he ran in Halton and was re-elected in the election of 1882 in Algoma and Grenville South in the election of 1887 he was defeated.

In 1890, he was promised a Senate seat, but did not pursue an appointment because his health was failing. During the conferences preceding Confederation, McDougall was personally in favour of electing members to the Senate of Canada. He was also offered a federal judgeship in British Columbia, which he turned down.

He died on May 29, 1905, due to a spine injury caused by walking off a moving train.

== Political views ==
McDougall was a Canada First nationalist. He espoused deep anti-Catholic and anti-Aboriginal views. He has also been called &quot;vain, erratic and irredeemably pigheaded&quot;.

<text>Fort Garry, also known as Upper Fort Garry, was a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post located at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in or near the area now known as The Forks in what is now central Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Fort Garry was established in 1822, although its first iteration was destroyed in 1826 by severe flooding. The trading post was rebuilt in 1836 and served as the administrative centre for the Red River Colony. From 1869 to 1870, the fort was briefly occupied by Louis Riel and his Métis followers during the Red River Rebellion. The fort was demolished in the 1880s to make way for Winnipeg&#x27;s Main Street, although the fort&#x27;s gate remains.

The site of the former fort was designated as a part of a larger National Historic Site in 1924. Development of a provincial heritage site on the historic site of Fort Garry began in the early 21st century.

==History==
Fort Garry was established by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) in 1822 on or near the site of the North West Company&#x27;s Fort Gibraltar established by John Wills in 1810 and destroyed by Governor Semple&#x27;s men in 1816 during the Pemmican War. Fort Garry was named after Nicholas Garry, deputy governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. It served as the centre of the fur trade within the Red River Colony. In 1826, a severe flood destroyed the fort.

The fort was rebuilt in 1836 by HBC to help facilitate the administrative and supply needs for the Red River Colony. The new fort was named Upper Fort Garry to differentiate it from &quot;the Lower Fort,&quot; or Lower Fort Garry, downriver, which was established in 1831. Throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, Upper Fort Garry played a minor role in the actual trading of furs but was central to the administration of the HBC and the surrounding settlement. The Council of Assiniboia, the administrative and judicial body of the Red River Colony mainly run by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company officials, met at Upper Fort Garry.

In 1869, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company agreed to surrender its monopoly in the North-West, including Upper Fort Garry. In late 1869 and early 1870, the fort was seized by Louis Riel and his Métis followers during the Red River Resistance. After the Resistance, the area around the fort continued to grow. In 1873, the city of Winnipeg was established and the name Fort Garry was no longer used. In 1881–1884 the majority of the fort was demolished to straighten Main Street (it was at Main Street and Assiniboine Avenue).

== Legacy ==
Fort Garry, along with the sites of nearby Forts Rouge and Gibraltar, were collectively designated a National Historic Site in 1924, under the name &quot;Forts Rouge, Garry, and Gibraltar National Historic Site&quot;. Together, the three sites are illustrative of the evolution of the fur trade in Western Canada, from exploration and expansion westward (Fort Rouge, established in 1738 by the French), to the dominance of the North West Company (Fort Gibraltar, established in 1807) and finally the ascendancy of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (Fort Garry). The gate at Fort Garry constitutes the only above-ground remains of this succession of forts.

On 15 June 1938 Canada Post issued &#x27;Fort Garry Gate, Winnipeg&#x27;, a 20¢ stamp.

Although only the fort&#x27;s main gate remains today, the name &quot;Fort Garry&quot; lives on through various institutions and businesses. An area or division of Winnipeg running along the Red River south of the original fort is called Fort Garry. The hotel beside the fort is called the Fort Garry Hotel, which was originally constructed for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway company. Fort Street and Garry Street are on either side of the hotel. Many companies, such as Fort Garry Industries and the Fort Garry Brewing Company, have adopted the name. The Fort Garry Horse has been a component of the Winnipeg military garrison throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries.

=== Provincial Heritage Park ===
Work has begun on a project to establish a heritage park in the area surrounding what remains of Upper Fort Garry. In the spring of 2010, a bill passed the House in the Manitoba Legislature, entitled &quot;The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act&quot;.

In 2007, a development company, Crystal Developers, sought to build an apartment complex next to the fort&#x27;s original &quot;footprint&quot;. However, the Friends of Upper Fort Garry, a group dedicated to developing a historical interpretive park at the site, was convened to oppose them. The plan called for an interpretive centre just outside the old fort&#x27;s walls, and a large surface parking lot that would have been placed closer to the walls than the apartment itself. After a City of Winnipeg-imposed deadline to raise funds to build a park on the site was nearing, Crystal Developers decided to grant the Friends an additional two years to finish raising the needed funds. Crystal ultimately bowed out of its proposed development plans. Two years later the City of Winnipeg approved the construction by Crystal Developers of a 25-storey apartment tower just west of the original location, on Assiniboine Ave.

The Friends raised enough funds to purchase the buildings already on the site of their proposed heritage park, including a Petro-Canada gas station. The only building that was allowed to stay untouched was the current home of the Manitoba Club, which started as an organization in 1874, only one year after the incorporation of Winnipeg. The existing Manitoba Club building was completed in 1905. The historic Fort Garry Hotel across the street was built shortly thereafter, in 1913.

The plans for the future heritage park at the site of Upper Fort Garry were officially unveiled in May 2010.

From the Hansard Records of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, dated Monday, June 14, 2010, it is clear that the boundaries of the proposed Upper Fort Garry Provincial Heritage Park, described in &quot;Bill 27–The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park Act&quot; then under consideration, would not include the Manitoba Club building. In the meeting referenced above, Mr. Jerry Gray (Friends of Upper Fort Garry), referring to the future park boundaries, states that the property is &quot;bordered by Main Street on the east side, Assiniboine on the south side and Fort Street on the west side and then goes up to the back where the gate property is.&quot; Evidently, the Manitoba Club property on Broadway is excluded from the proposed heritage park, aside from being located on the same city block. According to the records of the Thirty-Ninth Legislature, &quot;Bill 27&quot; received Royal Assent on June 17, 2010, by Proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor Philip S. Lee.

The park opened to the public on August 6, 2015, with development still to come.

<text>Living history is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, historical reenactment. Living history is an educational medium used by living history museums, historic sites, heritage interpreters, schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==
Living history&#x27;s approach to gain authenticity is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a certain era, to catch, in the sense of Walter Benjamin the &quot;spiritual message expressed in every monument&#x27;s and every site&#x27;s own &#x27;trace&#x27; and &#x27;aura, even in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in Guido von List&#x27;s book &quot;Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum&quot; (1900), which suggested rebuilding the Roman Carnuntum military camp in Vienna&#x27;s neighborhood as a sort of amusement park (compare &quot;Westworld&quot;). List, himself a right-wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors re-dressed in costumes and described rituals to signify &quot;in-game&quot; and &quot;out-game&quot; status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.

The term &quot;living history&quot; describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well-researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at living history museums can be blurred, as is the distinction between live action role-playing games.

While professional living history presentations routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the National Park Service land, NPS policy &quot;does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property.&quot; There are exceptions, such as Saylors Creek, Gettysburg. These are highly controlled with exacting safety standards, as well as exacting historical truths.

In Germany, medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance fairs and festivals, which are found in many cities. One such example is the Peter and Paul festival in Bretten. the Landshut Wedding or the Schloss Kaltenberg knights tournament. The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated due to a strong focus on authenticity.

Events with the professional reenactment group Ulfhednar lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars, and since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and worldwide. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title &quot;Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects&quot; started the dispute in 2009. On the other hand, Communist Eastern Germans had problems with accepting &quot;Indianistic&quot; living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany that were closely monitored by security forces.
That sort of &quot;second-hand&quot; living history is also part of western German folklore and attempts a high level of authenticity.

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called first-person interpretation) or out of character (also called third-person interpretation). While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and handicrafts. Depending on the historical period portrayed, these might include spinning, sewing, loom weaving, tablet weaving, inkle weaving or tapestry weaving, cloth dyeing, basket weaving, rope making, leather-working, shoemaking, metalworking, glassblowing, woodworking or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==
Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an encampment or display area at an event, and have a separate area for combat reenactment activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily American Civil War groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.

==In education==
As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history – the school – with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness. Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation. &quot;Interpreters&quot; are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has. These meanings are often a melding of fact and folklore.

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual&#x27;s personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing among others, are considered &quot;folk artifacts&quot;, which are grouped under the heading of &quot;material culture&quot;.

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of experiential learning in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others. Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels. Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of Colonial Williamsburg, &quot;That the Future May Learn from the Past&quot;, proclaims the site&#x27;s commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of aiding teachers in instruction on the village.

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia, high school class, have chosen to integrate public history into their curricula. Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled &quot;Applied History&quot;, in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various public history institutions. Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as Middelaldercentret in Denmark or the Netherlands Open Air Museum in the Netherlands provide living history for school children as a part of their education.

<text>A resource fork is a fork of a file on Apple&#x27;s classic Mac OS operating system that is used to store structured data. It is one of the two forks of a file, along with the data fork, which stores data that the operating system treats as unstructured. Resource fork capability has been carried over to the modern macOS for compatibility.

A resource fork stores information in a specific form, containing details such as icon bitmaps, the shapes of windows, definitions of menus and their contents, and application code (machine code). For example, a word processing file might store its text in the data fork, while storing any embedded images in the same file&#x27;s resource fork. The resource fork is used mostly by executables, but any file can have a resource fork.

In a 1986 technical note, Apple strongly recommended that developers do not put general data into the resource fork of a file. According to Apple, there are parts of the system software that rely on resource forks having only valid Resource Manager information in them.

The resource fork was conceived and implemented by Apple programmer Bruce Horn.

== Macintosh file systems ==

The resource fork has three purposes in classic Macintosh file systems:
* It stores all graphical data on disk until it is needed, then retrieved, drawn on the screen, and thrown away. This software variant of virtual memory reduces memory requirements from 1 MB in the Lisa to 128 KB in Macintosh.
* It provides a way for a non-programmer to perform internationalization and localization, because all the pictures and text are stored separately in a resource fork.
* It can be used to distribute nearly all of the components of an application in a single file, reducing clutter and simplifying application installation and removal.

The resource fork is implemented in all of the file systems used for system drives in the classic Mac OS (MFS, HFS and HFS Plus), and in the macOS-only APFS. The presence of a resource fork makes it easy to store a variety of additional information, such as an icon that the desktop should display for that file. While the data fork allows random access to any offset within it, access to the resource fork works like extracting structured records from a database. (Microsoft Windows also has a concept of &quot;resources&quot;, but these are completely unrelated to resources in Mac OS.)

The Macintosh file systems store metadata distinct from either the data or resource fork, such as the creation and modification timestamps, the file type and creator codes, and fork lengths.

Some files have only a resource fork. One example is a font file in the classic Mac OS. Another example is a Classic 68k application, where even the executable code is contained in resources of type &#x27;CODE&#x27;. Later PowerPC binaries stored the executable code in the data fork.

Since resource forks were supported only on Macintosh file systems including MFS, HFS, HFS Plus, and APFS, they could not be copied to the file systems of other operating systems. The Mac BinHex and MacBinary formats were invented to encode resource and data forks into one file, for transfer between systems. A/UX supported resource forks on Unix file systems via the AppleSingle and AppleDouble formats. Starting with Mac OS X Tiger, AppleDouble was used to store resource forks on file systems such as Windows SMB shares and FAT32 (File Allocation Table) volumes.

In the HFS Plus file system, settings can be made to allow other forks in addition to the data and resource forks, to create a &quot;multi-fork&quot; application.

As of August 7, 2002, Apple recommended that developers should not build resources into resource forks in Mach-O binaries on Mac OS X.

== Resource identifiers ==
Each resource has an OSType identifier (a four byte value), an ID (a signed 16-bit word), and an optional name. There are standardized resource types for dialog boxes (codice_1), images (codice_2), sounds (codice_3) and executable binaries (codice_4) which, until the advent of the PowerPC processor, were without exception stored in the resource fork. Subroutines for rendering windows are stored in their own type of resources (codice_5), and subroutines for rendering menus in theirs (codice_6). This arrangement enabled users to easily customize not only individual applications but also the operating system itself, using tools such as ResEdit to modify the resources of an application file or any of the system files.

Within an application or other code, resources can be loaded simply using a combination of their type, ID or name, without regard to how and where they are stored in the resource fork. The client is returned a handle to the loaded resource which can then be accessed like any other heap-based data. The OS component that facilitates this is the Resource Manager. In addition to abstracting the details of the data storage from the data, the Resource Manager also arranges sets of open resource forks into a stack, with the most recently opened file on top. When trying to load a resource, it will look in the top of the stack first, (perhaps the current document&#x27;s resource fork), then the next one down (the application&#x27;s resource fork), then the next one (system resource forks). This arrangement is very powerful it permits local resources to override more global ones lower down so an application can provide its own icons or fonts in place of the standard system ones, for example. It also allows an application to load resources from the system using the same API as any other resource, without regard to where or how that resource is stored to the application, all resources are equally available and easy to use. The system reserves resource IDs in a certain range to help avoid resource conflicts arising from this. Resource Manager APIs allow the programmer to manipulate the stack and modify the search behaviour.

== Editing ==

As the resource fork can be edited with a resource editor such as ResEdit, it can be used to localize and customize software. In addition, most resource editors allow visual editing of data. In macOS, it is possible to use resources when developing an application. However, if the application may need to be used in UFS, it is also possible to configure it so that the entire resource fork is moved to the data fork, using the Raw Resource File setting. The integrated development environments distributed for free by Apple Inc., which include MPW and Apple Developer&#x27;s Tools, include a compiler called Rez. This uses a dedicated language, also called Rez, which can be used to create a resource fork by compiling source code. A decompiler, DeRez, which can be used to change a resource fork back into Rez code is also included.

In the structure of the resource fork, there is a piece of data called a &quot;resource map&quot; which stores the positions of resource data items. This can be used to allow random access to resource data based on the defined IDs and names. The resource fork can be thought of as consisting of essentially two objects, the resource map and the resource data itself, but in fact each data type is a hierarchical structure which stores multiple items of data. The format in which the information in the resource data is stored is defined based on the types of information, which are known as &quot;resource types.&quot; Resource data often makes references to other types of data.

In macOS, forks are named &quot;file&quot;/..namedfork/&quot;forkname&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the resource fork of the file IMG_0593.jpg is IMG_0593.jpg/..namedfork/rsrc. The codice_7 command supports a codice_8 option which lists a file&#x27;s forks.

== Accessing ==
Resource forks appear as the extended attribute com.apple.ResourceFork.

Previously resource forks were accessed via the &#x27;Resource Manager&#x27; API. This API is now deprecated.

Under the deprecated API:
# When a resource fork is accessed, data including the start position and length of the resource data and resource map is read in from the header.
# If a resource type to read in has been specified, a check is performed to make sure that type is present in the resource list, and the number of items of data containing that type and their offsets in the resource reference list from the start position of the resource map is found.
# The resource ID, the offset of the resource name, the resource properties, and the offset of the data from the start position of the resource data is found.
# If resource data with the specified ID or name is present in the resource data, the offset obtained above is accessed, the data length is found, and all the data stored there is read in, and returned as the return value.

File Manager APIs such as codice_9 also allowed access to the raw resource fork; however, they should be used only for applications such as copying a file Apple strongly warns against using the resource fork as a &quot;second data fork.&quot;

From the POSIX interface, the resource fork could be accessed as codice_10 or as codice_11; the shorter form was deprecated in Mac OS X v10.4 and removed completely in Mac OS X v10.7.

== Data types ==
The smallest elements making up a resource fork are called data types. There are several data types. After a resource fork is accessed, its contents can be found by reading it in as appropriate for the data types defined in advance. Placing definitions inside the program stating how data is to be treated makes it possible to store resources called TMPL resources as well. Using this method increases the visibility of the data when viewed with a program such as ResEdit, making later editing simpler. As the Macintosh platform originated with Motorola-based processors (68k and PPC), the data is serialized to disk in big-endian format.

The following is a list of the major data types, in alphabetical order.
== Types ==
The type codes below, like the above datatypes, are used as type identifiers for more than resource forks themselves: they are used to identify files themselves, to describe data in the clipboard, and much more.

Types must be 4 bytes long, so types like snd and STR actually have a space (0x20) at the end.
== Editors ==
; ResEdit: Distributed free of charge by Apple. Can be used for visual editing of resource data. If the structure of data is known, it can display a range of different types of data in a visual format. Does not run on modern macOS.
; Resorcerer: Expensive, but popular, as it can be used for visual editing of many more types of data than ResEdit.
; HexEdit: A binary editor, which in fact is normally used more for editing the data fork rather than the resource fork.
; ResKnife: Open-source editor for Mac OS X; no longer maintained.
; Rezycle: A macOS tool that extracts resources from a resource fork into separate binary files while converting many types into formats suitable for modern development.
; resource_dasm: An open-source resource extractor for macOS and Linux, also capable of converting many resources into modern formats.
; ResForge: resource editor for macOS, capable of editing classic resource fork files and related formats. Compatible with macOS 10.14 or later. Runs natively on both 64-bit Intel and Apple Silicon.

== Compatibility ==
The complexity of programming with resource forks has led to compatibility problems when accessing other file systems via file sharing protocols such as AFP, SMB, NFS and FTP, when storing to non-HFS volumes, or when transmitting files to other systems in other ways (such as via email). The AFP protocol natively supports Resource Forks, and so resource forks are typically transmitted to these volumes as-is, and stored by the server transparently to clients. The SMB protocol supports a file metadata system similar to Macintosh forks known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSes hereafter). macOS did not support storing resource forks in ADSes on SMB volumes by default until Mac OS X v10.6. In previous versions of the OS, including upgraded versions of 10.6, this feature can be enabled with a param change or by creating a special file.

Networked file sharing protocols such as NFSv3 and FTP do not have a concept of file metadata, and so there is no way to natively store resource forks. This is also true when writing to certain types of local file systems, including UFS, and on SMB volumes where Alternate Data Stream support is not enabled. In those cases, macOS stores metadata and resource forks using a technique called AppleDouble, in which the data fork is written as one file, and the resource fork and metadata are written as an entirely separate file preceded by a &quot;._&quot; naming convention. For example: ExampleFile.psd would contain the data fork, and ._ExampleFile.psd would contain the resource fork and metadata.

Compatibility problems can arise because macOS will handle storage of resource forks differently, depending on macOS version, settings, and file system type. For example, on an SMB network with a mixture of 10.5 and 10.6 clients. A freshly installed 10.6 client will look for and store resource forks on an SMB volume in ADSes, but the 10.5 client will (by default) ignore ADSes and use AppleDouble format to handle forks. If a fileserver supports both AFP and NFS, then clients using NFS will store files in AppleDouble format, whereas AFP users will stored the resource fork natively. In those cases, compatibility can sometimes be maintained by forcing clients to use, or not use, AppleDouble format.

Many fileservers providing AFP support do not natively support resource forks on their local file systems. In those cases the forks may be stored in special ways, such as specially named files, special directories, or even Alternate Data Streams.

Another challenge is preserving resource forks when transmitting files using non-resource fork-aware applications or with certain transfer methods, including email and FTP. A number of file formats, such as MacBinary and BinHex, have been created to handle this. Command-line system tools codice_12 and codice_13 allow manual flattening and merging of resource forks. In addition, a file server seeking to present file systems to Macintosh clients must accommodate the resource fork as well as the data fork of files; UNIX servers providing AFP support usually implement this with hidden directories.

Older applications written with the Carbon API have a potential issue when being ported to the current Intel Macs. While the Resource Manager and operating system know how to deserialize data correctly for common resources like &#x27;codice_3&#x27; or &#x27;codice_15&#x27;, resources created using TMPL resources have to be byte swapped manually to ensure file interoperability between PPC and Intel-based versions of an application. (While the resource map and other implementation details are big-endian, the Resource Manager by itself does not have any knowledge of the contents of a generic resource, and so cannot perform the byte swapping automatically.)

Until the advent of Mac OS X v10.4, the standard UNIX command-line utilities in macOS (such as codice_16 and codice_17) did not respect resource forks. To copy files with resource forks, one had to use codice_18 or CpMac and MvMac.

== Other operating systems ==
The concept of a resource manager for graphics objects, to save memory, originated in the OOZE package on the Xerox Alto in Smalltalk-76. The concept is now largely universal in all modern operating systems. However, the concept of the resource fork remains peculiar to the Macintosh. Most operating systems used a binary file containing resources, which is then &quot;tacked onto&quot; the end of an existing program file. This solution is used on Microsoft Windows for instance, and similar solutions are used with the X Window System, although the resources are often left as a separate file.

The Windows NT NTFS can support forks (and so can be a file server for Mac files), the native feature providing that support is called an alternate data stream. Windows operating system features (such as the standard Summary tab in the Properties page for non-Office files) and Windows applications use them and Microsoft was developing a next-generation file system that has this sort of feature as basis.

Early versions of the BeOS implemented a database within the file system, which could be used in a manner analogous to a resource fork. Performance issues led to a change in later releases to a system of complex file system attributes. Under this system resources were handled in a fashion somewhat more analogous to the Mac.

AmigaOS does not use forked files. Its executable files are internally divided into a modular structure of large pieces (hunk) capable of storing code, data, and additional information. Similarly, data and project files have a chunk structure codified in the IFF standard. Other file types are stored similarly to other operating systems. Though not strictly a resource fork, AmigaOS stores meta data in files known as codice_19 files. codice_19 files can be identified by the codice_19 extension; for example, if you save a project to a disk, two files will be saved, codice_22 and codice_23. codice_22 would be the actual project data and codice_23 would contain the project icon, information regarding which program is needed to open the project (since there is no application binding in AmigaOS), special project options and any user comments. codice_19 files are invisible on the Amiga&#x27;s desktop (Workbench). The icon on the desktop, taken from the codice_19 itself, is the interface metaphor through which the user interacts both with the project itself and its associated codice_19 file. A dialog box accessible by right-clicking the icon allows the user to see and modify the metadata present in the codice_19 file. codice_19 files can be seen as individual files in the command-line interface or a File manager. Modern AmigaOS clones (AROS, MorphOS and AOS4) inherit the structure (complete with metadata) of the codice_19 files of older AmigaOS versions, and can also accept standard PNG graphic files as icon bitmaps in their codice_19 files.

NeXT operating systems NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP, their successor, macOS, and other systems like RISC OS implemented another solution. Under these systems the resources are left in an original format, for instance, pictures are included as complete TIFF files instead of being encoded into some sort of container. These resources are then placed in a directory along with the executable code and &quot;raw data&quot;. The directory (called a &quot;bundle&quot; or &quot;application directory&quot;) is then presented to the user as the application itself. This solution provides all of the same functionality as the resource fork, but allows the resources to be easily manipulated by any application a &quot;resource editor&quot; (like ResEdit) is not needed. From the command-line interface, the bundle appears to be a normal directory. This approach was not an option on the classic Mac OS, since the file system (MFS) did not support separate catalog directories. When catalog file support was included in Mac OS, with the HFS filesystem, the resource fork was retained. macOS does retain the classic Resource Manager API as part of its Carbon libraries for backward compatibility. However, the resources themselves can now be stored in separate data files within the file system the Resource Manager now hides this implementation change from the client code.

<text>Ecumenism ( ; alternatively spelled oecumenism)also called interdenominationalism, or ecumenicalismis the concept and principle that Christians who belong to different Christian denominations should work together to develop closer relationships among their churches and promote Christian unity. The adjective &quot;ecumenical&quot; is thus applied to any non-denominational or inter-denominational initiative which encourages greater cooperation and union among Christian denominations and churches. Ecumenical dialogue is a central feature of contemporary ecumenism.

The fact that all Christians belonging to mainstream Christian denominations profess faith in Jesus, believe that the Bible is inspired by God (John 1:1), and receive baptism according to the Trinitarian formula is seen as being a basis for ecumenism and its goal of Christian unity. Ecumenists cite as the biblical grounds of striving for church unity, in which Jesus prays &quot;may all be one&quot; in order &quot;that the world may know&quot; and believe the Gospel message.

In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Germanus V of Constantinople, wrote a letter &quot;addressed &#x27;To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be&#x27;, urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a &#x27;League of Churches&#x27;, parallel to the newly founded League of Nations&quot;. In 1937, Christian leaders from mainstream Christian churches resolved to establish the World Council of Churches, to work for the cause of Christian unity; it today includes churches from most major traditions of Christianity as full members, including the Assyrian Church of the East, the Old Catholic Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the Anglican Communion, the Baptist World Alliance, the Mennonite churches, the World Methodist Council, the Moravian Church, the Pentecostal churches and the World Communion of Reformed Churches, as well as almost all jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church; the Roman Catholic Church participates as an observer, sending delegates to official gatherings.

Many regional councils affiliated with the World Council of Churches, such as the Middle East Council of Churches, National Council of Churches in Australia and Christian Churches Together, work for the cause of Christian unity on the domestic level, with member denominations including churches from the Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Methodist, Anglican, and Reformed traditions, among others.

Each year, many ecumenical Christians observe the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity for the goal of ecumenism, which is coordinated by the World Council of Churches and adopted by many of its member churches.

The terms &quot;ecumenism&quot; and &quot;ecumenical&quot; come from the Greek (&quot;oikoumene&quot;), which means &quot;the whole inhabited world&quot;, and was historically used with specific reference to the Roman Empire. The ecumenical vision comprises both the search for the visible unity of the Church (Ephesians 4:3) and the &quot;whole inhabited earth&quot; (Matthew 24:14) as the concern of all Christians. In Christianity, the qualification &quot;ecumenical&quot; was originally and still is used in terms such as &quot;ecumenical council&quot; and &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;, in the meaning of pertaining to the totality of the larger Church (such as the Catholic Church or the Eastern Orthodox Church) rather than being restricted to one of its constituent local churches or dioceses. Used in this sense, the term carries no connotation of re-uniting the historically separated Christian denominations but presumes a unity of local congregations in a worldwide communion.

==Purpose and goal==
The term ecumenism as it is now commonly used refers to interdenominational cooperation between different Christian churches. These initiatives can range from local churches of different denominations operating a soup kitchen for the poor, hosting an ecumenical Bible study with participants from different Christian traditions, inviting all baptized Christians to partake in a Lovefeast when churches celebrate them, to holding an ecumenical Stations of the Cross service on Fridays during the Christian liturgical season of Lent with the service being held at a different local church each Friday (e.g. Catholic, Lutheran, Moravian, Anglican, Reformed and Methodist). The ultimate goal of ecumenism is the recognition of sacramental validity, eucharistic sharing, and the reaching of full communion between different Christian denominations. There are a variety of different expectations of what that Christian unity looks like, how it is brought about, what ecumenical methods ought to be engaged, and what both short- and long-term objectives of the ecumenical movement should be.

Baptism according to the Trinitarian formula, which is done in most mainstream Christian denominations, is seen as being the grounds for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians. With respect to ecumenism, A. W. Tozer maintained that &quot;Unity in Christ is not something to be achieved; it is something to be recognized.&quot; Ecumenists cite as the Biblical basis of striving for church unity, in which Jesus prays that Christians &quot;may all be one&quot; in order &quot;that the world may know&quot; and believe the Gospel message. As such, ecumenism has a strong implication for the Church&#x27;s mission of evangelism, which is referenced in : &quot;By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another&quot;. Additionally, Jesus emphasized that the ties of Christians to one another are much greater than those to blood relatives.

Historically, the term &quot;ecumenism&quot; was originally used in the context of the larger ecumenical councils organised with the support of the Roman Emperor. The aim of these councils was to clarify matters of Christian theology and doctrine, leading to the meaning of unity behind the term &quot;ecumenical&quot;. The ecumenical councils brought together bishops from across the Roman Empire, with a total of seven ecumenical councils accepted to have been held by both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches before the Great Schism dividing the two churches; the first four ecumenical councils are recognized by the Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion and Reformed churches though they are &quot;considered subordinate to Scripture&quot;. The Assyrian Church of the East acknowledges the first two ecumenical councils, while Oriental Orthodox Churches accept the first three ecumenical councils.

==Historic divisions in Christianity==
===Christian denominations today===
Christianity has not been a monolithic faith since the first century, also known as the &quot;Apostolic Age&quot;, and in the present day, a number of widely varied Christian groups exist, both within and without mainstream Christianity. Despite the division between these groups, a number of commonalities exist throughout their traditions, understanding of theology, governing church systems, doctrine and language. As such, many of these groups are visibly divided into different communions or denominations, groupings of Christians and their churches in full communion with one another, but to some degree set apart from other Christians.

The World Council of Churches counts 348 member churches, representing more than half a billion members of the major Christian traditions. This, with the Catholic Church&#x27;s 1.25 billion Christians, indicates that 349 churches/denominations already account for nearly 80% of the world&#x27;s Christian population.

One problem with the larger numbers is that single denominations can be counted multiple times. For example, the Catholic Church is a single church, or communion, comprising 24 distinct self-governing particular churches in full communion with the bishop of Rome (the largest being the Latin Church, commonly called &quot;Roman Catholic&quot;). Further, the Catholic Church&#x27;s presence in each country is counted as a different denomination—though this is in no way an ecclesiologically accurate definition. This can result in the one Catholic Church being counted as 242 distinct denominations, as in the &quot;World Christian Encyclopedia&quot;.

Additionally, single nondenominational congregations or megachurches without denominational affiliation are effectively counted each as its own denomination, resulting in cases where entire &quot;denominations&quot; may account for only a handful of people. Other denominations may be very small remnants of once larger churches. The United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing (Shakers) have only two full members, for example, yet are a distinct denomination.

Most current divisions are the result of historical schisms—a break in the full communion between previously united Churches, bishops, or communities. Some historical schisms proved temporary and were eventually healed, others have hardened into the denominations of today. However individual denominations are counted, it is generally acknowledged that they fall into the following major &quot;families&quot; of churches (though certain parts of some Christian denominations, such as Quakerism, may fall into the mainline category though the majority are evangelical Quakers):
* The Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East;
* The Catholic Church (The Catholic Church is a hierarchical religious institution of universal scope, and sees itself and proclaims itself as the one commissioned by Jesus Christ to help walk the spiritual path to God);
* Mainline Protestant (including the Lutheran Churches, Moravian Church, Anglican Communion, Reformed Churches, Waldensian Churches, among others) and Old Catholic Churches; 
* Evangelical (including the Baptist, Methodist and Plymouth Brethren Churches) and Pentecostal Churches;
* Restorationist sects (Irvingians, Swedenborgians, Latter-day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Christadelphians, La Luz del Mundo, Iglesia ni Cristo etc.) (Non-Nicene Christianity)

In the United States, the historic racial/ethnic churches are sometimes counted as a distinct family of churches, though they may otherwise fit into any one of the previous categories.

Some of these families are in themselves a single communion, such as the Catholic Church. Other families are a very general movement with no universal governing authority. Protestantism, for example, includes such diverse groups as Adventists, Anabaptists, Baptists, Congregationalists, Evangelicals, Hussites, Lutherans, Messianic Jews, Methodists (inclusive of the Holiness movement), Moravians, Pentecostals, Presbyterians, Reformed, and Waldensians. Many of these have, as a result of ecumenical dialogue, established full or partial communion agreements.

===Ancient apostolic churches===

The oldest lasting schism in Christianity resulted from fifth-century disagreements on Christology, heightened by philosophical, linguistic, cultural, and political differences.

The first significant, lasting split in historic Christianity, the so-called Nestorian Schism, came from the Church of the East, consisting largely of Eastern Syriac churches outside the Roman Empire, who left full communion after 431 in response to misunderstandings and personality conflicts at the Council of Ephesus. After fifteen centuries of estrangement, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Catholic Church entered into an ecumenical dialogue in the 1980s, resulting in agreement on the very issue that split them asunder, in the 1994 Common Christological Declaration, which identifies the origin of the schism as largely linguistic, due to problems of translating very delicate and precise terminology from Latin to Aramaic and vice versa.

As part of the then-ongoing Christological controversy, following the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the next large split came with the Syriac and Coptic churches dividing themselves. The churches dissented from Chalcedon, becoming today&#x27;s Oriental Orthodox Churches. These also include the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in India. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this division, with common Christological statements being made between Pope John Paul II and Syriac patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, as well as between representatives of both Oriental Orthodoxy and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

===Great Schism===

Although the Christian world as a whole did not experience any major church divisions for centuries afterward, the Eastern, predominantly Greek-speaking and Western, predominantly Latin-speaking, cultural divisions drifted toward isolation, culminating in the mutual excommunication of Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius and the legate of then-deceased Pope of Rome Leo IX in 1054, in what is known as the Great Schism. The canonical separation was sealed by the Latin sacking of Constantinople (1204) during the Fourth Crusade and through the poor reception of the Council of Florence (1449) among the Orthodox Eastern Churches.

The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex. Aside from the natural rivalry between the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire and the Franco-Latin Holy Roman Empire, one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West in general—and in the diocese of Rome in particular—of the Filioque clause (&quot;and the Son&quot;) into the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, which the East viewed as a violation of ecclesiastical procedure at best, an abuse of papal authority as only an Ecumenical Council could amend what had been defined by a previous council, and a heresy at worst, inasfar as the Filioque implies that the essential divinity of the Holy Spirit is derived not from the Father alone as &quot;arche&quot; (singular head and source), but from the perichoretic union between the Father and the Son. That the hypostasis or persona of the Spirit either is or is produced by the mutual, pre-eternal love between God and His Word is an explanation which Eastern Christian detractors have alleged is rooted in the medieval Augustinian appropriation of Plotinian Neoplatonism. (See Augustine of Hippo, &quot;De Trinitate&quot;.)

Both West and East agreed that the patriarch of Rome was owed a &quot;primacy of honour&quot; by the other patriarchs (those of Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras, that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two. In 1965, the excommunications were &quot;committed to oblivion&quot;.

The resulting division remains, however, providing the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, both of which are globally distributed bodies and no longer restricted geographically or culturally to the &quot;West&quot; or &quot;East&quot;, respectively. (There exist both Eastern Rite Roman Catholicism and Western Rite Orthodoxy, for example.) There is an ongoing and fruitful Catholic-Orthodox dialogue.

===Western schisms and reformations===

In Western Christianity, there were a handful of geographically isolated movements that preceded in the spirit of the Protestant Reformation. The Cathars were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times, largely as a result of the Albigensian Crusade. In northern Italy and southeastern France, Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians in the 12th century, which remains the largest non-Catholic church in Italy and is in full communion with the Italian Methodist Church. In Bohemia, a movement in the early 15th century by Jan Hus called the Hussites called for reform of Catholic teaching and still exists to this day, known as the Moravian Church. Though generally counted among Protestant churches, groups such as the Waldensians and Moravians pre-exist Protestantism proper.

The Protestant Reformation began, symbolically, with the posting of Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Ninety-Five Theses&quot; in Saxony on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the Western Church. Luther&#x27;s writings, combined with the work of Swiss theologian Huldrych Zwingli and French theologian and politician John Calvin, sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, the Catholic Church separated from them, instigating a rift in Western Christianity. This schism created the Mainline Protestant Churches, including especially the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.

In England, Henry VIII of England declared himself to be supreme head of the Church of England with the Act of Supremacy in 1531, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. Thomas Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury introduced the English Reformation in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans. This schism created today&#x27;s Anglican Communion.

The Radical Reformation, also mid-sixteenth century, moved beyond the Magisterial Reformation, emphasizing the invisible, spiritual reality of the Church, apart from any visible ecclesial manifestation. A significant group of Radical reformers were the Anabaptists, people such as Menno Simons and Jakob Ammann, whose movements resulted in today&#x27;s communities of Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, and Brethren churches, and to some extent, the Bruderhof Communities.

Further reform movements within Anglicanism during the 16th through 18th centuries, with influence from the Radical Reformation, produced the Puritans and Separatists, creating today&#x27;s Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, and eventually Unitarian Universalism.

The Methodist churches, which uphold Wesleyan-Arminian theology, grew out of a revival within Anglicanism, especially in England and the American colonies, under the leadership of the brothers John Wesley and Charles Wesley, both priests in the Church of England. This movement also produced the Holiness movement churches.

The Old Catholic Church split from the Catholic Church in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the dogma of Papal Infallibility as promoted by the First Vatican Council of 1869–1870. The term &quot;Old Catholic&quot; was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht who were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between some independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.

The Evangelical movement takes form as the result of spiritual renewal efforts in the anglophone world in the 18th century. According to religion scholar, social activist, and politician Randall Balmer, Evangelicalism resulted &quot;from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain—warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans&quot;. Historian Mark Noll adds to this list High Church Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of &quot;rigorous spirituality and innovative organization&quot;.

Pentecostalism is likewise born out of this context, and traditionally traces its origins to what it describes as an outpouring of the Holy Spirit on 1 January 1901 in Topeka, Kansas, at the Bethel Bible College. Subsequent charismatic revivals in Wales in 1904 and the Azusa Street Revival in 1906 are held as the beginnings of the Pentecostal movement. These started just a few hours after Pope Leo XIII led a prayer &quot;Veni Spiritus Sanctus&quot; during an &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; message, consecrating the 20th century to the Holy Spirit and through this prayer to the reunion of Christianity.

==Three approaches to Christian unity==
For some Protestants, spiritual unity, and often unity on the church&#x27;s teachings on central issues, suffices. According to Lutheran theologian Edmund Schlink, most important in Christian ecumenism is that people focus primarily on Christ, not on separate church organizations. In Schlink&#x27;s book &quot;Ökumenische Dogmatik&quot; (1983), he says Christians who see the risen Christ at work in the lives of various Christians or in diverse churches realize that the unity of Christ&#x27;s church has never been lost, but has instead been distorted and obscured by different historical experiences and by spiritual myopia. Both are overcome in renewed faith in Christ. Included in that is responding to his admonition (John 17; Philippians 2) to be one in him and love one another as a witness to the world. The result of mutual recognition would be a discernible worldwide fellowship, organized in a historically new way.

For a significant part of the Christian world, one of the highest goals to be sought is the reconciliation of the various denominations by overcoming the historical divisions within Christianity. Even where there is broad agreement upon this goal, approaches to ecumenism vary. Generally, Protestants see fulfillment of the goal of ecumenism as consisting in general agreements on teachings about central issues of faith, with mutual pastoral accountability between the diverse churches regarding the teachings of salvation.

For Catholics and Orthodox on the other hand, the true unity of Christendom is treated in accordance with their more sacramental understanding of the Body of Christ; this ecclesiastical matter for them is closely linked to key theological issues (e.g. regarding the Eucharist and the historical Episcopate), and requires full dogmatic assent to the pastoral authority of the Church for full communion to be considered viable and valid. Thus, there are different answers even to the &quot;question of the church&quot;, which finally is the goal of the ecumenist movement itself. However, the desire of unity is expressed by many denominations, generally that all who profess faith in Christ in sincerity, would be more fully cooperative and supportive of one another.

For the Catholic and Orthodox churches, the process of approaching one another can be described as formally split in two successive stages: the &quot;dialogue of love&quot; and the &quot;dialogue of truth&quot;. Examples of acts belonging to the former include the mutual revocation in 1965 of the anathemas of 1054, returning the relics of Sabbas the Sanctified (a common saint) to Mar Saba in the same year, and the first visit of a Pope to an Orthodox country in a millennium (Pope John Paul II accepting the invitation of the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Teoctist, in 1999), among others.

Christian ecumenism can be described in terms of the three largest divisions of Christianity: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant. While this underemphasizes the complexity of these divisions, it is a useful model.

===Catholicism===
The Catholic Church has always considered it a duty of the highest rank to seek full unity with estranged communions of fellow Christians and, at the same time, to reject what it sees as a false union which would mean being unfaithful to or glossing over the teaching of sacred scripture and tradition.

Before the &quot;Aggiornamento&quot; or &quot;updating&quot; of the Second Vatican Council, the main stress was laid on this second aspect, as exemplified in canon 1258 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law:
# It is illicit for the faithful to assist at or participate in any way in non-Catholic religious functions.
# For a serious reason requiring, in case of doubt, the Bishop&#x27;s approval, passive or merely material presence at non-Catholic funerals, weddings and similar occasions because of holding a civil office or as a courtesy can be tolerated, provided there is no danger of perversion or scandal.

The 1983 Code of Canon Law has no corresponding canon. It absolutely forbids Catholic priests to concelebrate the Eucharist with members of communities which are not in full communion (canon 908), but allows, in certain circumstances and under certain conditions, other sharing in the sacraments. The &quot;Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism&quot;, 102 states: &quot;Christians may be encouraged to share in spiritual activities and resources, i.e., to share that spiritual heritage they have in common in a manner and to a degree appropriate to their present divided state.&quot;

Pope John XXIII, who convoked the council that brought this change of emphasis about, said that the council&#x27;s aim was to seek renewal of the church itself, which would serve, for those separated from the See of Rome, as a &quot;gentle invitation to seek and find that unity for which Jesus Christ prayed so ardently to his heavenly Father&quot;. Pope Paul VI, in his 1964 encyclical letter &quot;Ecclesiam Suam&quot; observed that &quot;ecumenical dialogue, as it is called, is already in being, and there are places where it is beginning to make considerable progress&quot;.

Some elements of the Catholic perspective on ecumenism are illustrated in the following quotations from the council&#x27;s decree on ecumenism, &quot;Unitatis Redintegratio&quot; of 21 November 1964, and Pope John Paul II&#x27;s encyclical, &quot;Ut Unum Sint&quot; of 25 May 1995.



While some Eastern Orthodox churches commonly rebaptize converts from the Catholic Church, thereby refusing to recognize the baptism that the converts have previously received, the Catholic Church has always accepted the validity of all the sacraments administered by the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches.

The Catholic Church likewise has very seldom applied the terms &quot;heterodox&quot; or &quot;heretic&quot; to the Eastern Orthodox churches or its members, although there are clear differences in doctrine, notably about the authority of the Pope, Purgatory, and the filioque clause. More often, the term &quot;separated&quot; or &quot;schismatic&quot; has been applied to the state of the Eastern Orthodox churches.

===Orthodoxy===

The Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches are two distinct bodies of local churches. The churches within each body share full communion, although there is not official communion between the two bodies. Both consider themselves to be the original church, from which the West was divided in the 5th and 11th centuries, respectively (after the 3rd and 7th Ecumenical councils).

Many theologians of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches engage in theological dialogue with each other and with some of the Western churches, though short of full communion. The Eastern Orthodox have participated in the ecumenical movement, with students active in the World Student Christian Federation since the late 19th century. Most Eastern Orthodox and all Oriental Orthodox churches are members of the World Council of Churches. Kallistos of Diokleia, a bishop of the Eastern Orthodox Church has stated that ecumenism &quot;is important for Orthodoxy: it has helped to force the various Orthodox Churches out of their comparative isolation, making them meet one another and enter into a living contact with non-Orthodox Christians.&quot;

Historically, the relationship between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion has been congenial, with the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1922 recognising Anglican orders as valid. He wrote: &quot;That the orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders.&quot; Moreover, some Eastern Orthodox bishops have assisted in the ordination of Anglican bishops; for example, in 1870, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, was one of the bishops who consecrated Henry MacKenzie as the Suffragan Bishop of Nottingham. From 1910 to 1911, the era before World War I, Raphael of Brooklyn, an Eastern Orthodox bishop, &quot;sanctioned an interchange of ministrations with the Episcopalians in places where members of one or the other communion are without clergy of their own&quot;. Bishop Raphael stated that in places &quot;where there is no resident Orthodox Priest&quot;, an Anglican (Episcopalian) priest could administer Marriage, Holy Baptism, and the Blessed Sacrament to an Orthodox layperson. In 1912, however, Bishop Raphael ended the intercommunion after becoming uncomfortable with the fact that the Anglican Communion contained different churchmanships within it, e.g. High Church, Evangelical, etc. However, after World War I, the Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius was organized in 1927, which much like the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association worked on ecumenism between the two Churches; both of these organisations continue their task today.

In accordance with the Soviet anti-religious legislation under the state atheism of the Soviet Union, several Russian Orthodox churches and seminaries were closed. With ecumenical aid from Methodists in the United States, two Russian Orthodox seminaries were reopened, and hierarchs of the Orthodox Church thankfully made the following statement: &quot;The services rendered by the American Methodists and other Christian friends will go down in history of the Orthodox Church as one of its brightest pages in that dark and trying time of the church. Our Church will never forget the Samaritan service which your whole Church unselfishly rendered us. May this be the beginning of closer friendship for our churches and nations.&quot;

===Protestantism===
Protestants are involved in a variety of ecumenical groups, working in some cases toward organic denominational unity and in other cases for cooperative purposes alone. Because of the wide spectrum of Protestant denominations and perspectives, full cooperation has been difficult at times. Edmund Schlink&#x27;s &quot;Ökumenische Dogmatik&quot; (1983, 1997) proposes a way through these problems to mutual recognition and renewed church unity.

====Lutheranism====

The Lutheran World Federation has several ongoing dialogues with respect to ecumenism:
* Lutheran-Anglican
* Lutheran-Mennonite-Roman Catholic
* Lutheran-Orthodox
* Lutheran-Reformed
* Lutheran-Roman Catholic

In 1999, the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, resolving the conflict over the nature of Justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation. On July 18, 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration. The World Communion of Reformed Churches (representing the &quot;80 million members of Congregational, Presbyterian, Reformed, United, Uniting, and Waldensian churches&quot;), adopted the &quot;Declaration&quot; in 2017.

On Reformation Day in 2016, Pope Francis of the Catholic Church travelled to Sweden (where the Lutheran Church is the national Church) to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation at Lund Cathedral, which serves as the cathedra for the Bishop of Lund of the Church of Sweden, a Lutheran Church. An official press release from the Holy See stated:
An ecumenical service was presided over by Bishop Munib Younan, the president of the Lutheran World Federation, , the General Secretary of the LWF, as well as Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church. Representatives from the Anglican Communion, Baptist World Alliance, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Salvation Army also participated in the predominantly Lutheran and Roman Catholic event. Pope Francis, in a joint statement with Bishop Munib A. Younan, stated that &quot;With gratitude we acknowledge that the Reformation helped give a greater centrality to sacred Scripture in the Church&#x27;s life&quot;.

Susan Wood, a Sister of Charity, who is a systematic theology professor and chair of the theology department at Marquette University and a former president of the Catholic Theological Society of America, stated that &quot;Since Vatican II, we have acknowledged an imperfect communion between Lutheran and Catholics&quot; and that &quot;There is no substantial difference in Lutheran and Catholic belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist&quot;. Wood stated that in the near future intercommunion could happen in places &quot;where people can&#x27;t get out, like nursing homes and prisons.&quot;

The Porvoo Communion is a communion that established altar and pulpit fellowship between Churches of the Lutheran and Anglican tradition.

====Anglicanism====

The members of the Anglican Communion have generally embraced the Ecumenical Movement, actively participating in such organizations as the World Council of Churches and the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA. Most provinces holding membership in the Anglican Communion have special departments devoted to ecumenical relations; however, the influence of Liberal Christianity has in recent years caused tension within the communion, causing some to question the direction ecumenism has taken them.

Each member church of the Anglican Communion makes its own decisions with regard to intercommunion. The 1958 Lambeth Conference recommended &quot;that where between two Churches not of the same denominational or confessional family, there is unrestricted &quot;communio in sacris&quot;, including mutual recognition and acceptance of ministries, the appropriate term to use is &#x27;full communion&#x27;, and that where varying degrees of relation other than &#x27;full communion&#x27; are established by agreement between two such churches the appropriate term is &#x27;intercommunion&#x27;.&quot;

Full communion has been established between Provinces of the Anglican Communion and these Churches:
* Old Catholic Churches of Europe
* Philippine Independent Church
* Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar
* Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
* Moravian Church in America, Northern and Southern Provinces

Full communion has been established between the Anglican Churches of Europe (England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar in Europe) and the Lutheran Churches of Northern Europe (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Lithuania, Great Britain and the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad) with the Porvoo Communion.

The Episcopal Church is currently engaged in dialogue with the following religious bodies:
* Churches Uniting in Christ (CUIC)
* Eastern Orthodox Church
* Catholic Church
* Presbyterian Church USA
* United Methodist Church
* Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican Province of America

Worldwide, an estimated forty million Anglicans belong to churches that do not participate in the Anglican Communion , a particular organization limited to one province per country. In these Anglican churches, there is strong opposition to the ecumenical movement and to membership in such bodies as the World and National Councils of Churches. Most of these churches are associated with the Continuing Anglican movement or the movement for Anglican realignment. While ecumenicalism in general is opposed, certain Anglican church bodies that are not members of the Anglican Communion—the Free Church of England and the Church of England in South Africa, for example—have fostered close and cooperative relations with other evangelical (if non-Anglican) churches, on an individual basis.

==Modern ecumenical movement==
One understanding of the ecumenical movement is that it came from the Catholic Church&#x27;s attempts to reconcile with Christians who had become separated over theological issues. Others see the 1910 World Missionary Conference as the birthplace of the ecumenical movement. Others yet point to the 1920 encyclical of the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Germanus V &quot;To the Churches of Christ Everywhere&quot; that suggested a &quot;fellowship of churches&quot; similar to the League of Nations.

Earlier, Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf (1700–1760), the renewer of the Moravian Church in the 18th century, was the first person to use the word &quot;ecumenical&quot; in this sense. His pioneering efforts to unite all Christians, regardless of denominational labels, into a &quot;Church of God in the Spirit&quot;—notably among German immigrants in Pennsylvania—were misunderstood by his contemporaries.

The founding of the London Missionary Society, a missionary society, occurred in 1795 by various evangelical denominations who had an interdenominational vision of the mission. It developed with the founding of the Evangelical Alliance in 1846 in London, England, by 52 evangelical denominations. Various other evangelical organizations have also contributed to the interdenominational movement. In the Biblical studies, there was the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students in 1947. In the area of Christian humanitarian aid, World Vision International was established in 1950. There was also the emergence of various interdenominational Bible colleges. In 1951, the World Evangelical Alliance (formerly the World Evangelical Fellowship) was founded by evangelical leaders from 21 countries at the first general assembly in Woudschoten (Zeist) in Netherlands.

Nathan Söderblom, Archbishop of Uppsala, the head of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, is known as the architect of the ecumenical movement of the twentieth century. During the First World War, he called on all Christian leaders to work for peace and justice. His leadership of the Christian &quot;Life and Work&quot; movement in the 1920s has led him to be recognised as one of the principal founders of the ecumenical movement. He was instrumental in chairing the World Conference of Life and Work in Stockholm, Sweden in 1925. At the Stockholm Conference in 1925, the culminating event in Söderblom&#x27;s ecumenical work, Protestant and Orthodox Christians from the major Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran and Anglican Churches, were all present and participating, with the exception of the Catholic Church. He was a close friend of the English ecumenist George Bell. In 1930, Söderblom was one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize for promoting Christian unity and helping create &#x27;that new attitude of mind which is necessary if peace between nations is to become reality&#x27;. He was first clergyman to receive a Nobel prize.

The contemporary ecumenical movement gained speed through the 1910 Edinburgh Missionary Conference. However this conference would not have been possible without the pioneering ecumenical work of the Christian youth movements: the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (founded 1844), the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (founded 1855), the World Student Christian Federation (founded 1895), and the Federal Council of Churches (founded 1908), predecessor to today&#x27;s National Council of Churches USA. Led by Methodist layman John R. Mott (former YMCA staff and in 1910 the General Secretary of WSCF), the World Mission conference marked the largest Protestant gathering to that time, with the express purposes of working across denominational lines for the sake of world missions. After the First World War further developments were the &quot;Faith and Order&quot; movement led by Charles Henry Brent, and the &quot;Life and Work&quot; movement led by Nathan Soderblom. In the 1930s, the tradition of an annual World Communion Sunday to celebrate ecumenical ties was established in the Presbyterian Church and was subsequently adopted by several other denominations.

After World War II, which had brought much devastation to many people, the church became a source of hope to those in need. In 1948, the first meeting of the World Council of Churches took place. Despite the fact that the meeting had been postponed due to World War II, the council took place in Amsterdam with the theme of &quot;Man&#x27;s Disorder and God&#x27;s Design&quot;. The focus of the church and the council following the gathering was on the damage created by the Second World War. The council and the movement went forward to continue the efforts of unifying the church globally in the mission of helping all those in need, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual. The movement led to an understanding amongst the churches that, despite difference, they could join together to be an element of great change, hope, and peace in the world. More importantly, the council and the movement lead to not only wider ecumenism but to the forming of councils amongst the denominations that connected churches across continental lines. Today, the World Council of Churches sees its role as sharing &quot;the legacy of the one ecumenical movement and the responsibility to keep it alive&quot; and acting &quot;as a trustee for the inner coherence of the movement&quot;. Some scholars, such as Antoaneta Sabău, think that &quot;the features that ecumenism may display today could testify against the idea of a diminished interest in ecumenical matters, and rather for the fact that essential concepts of ecumenism have already become integrative parts of contemporary theologies.&quot;

==Contemporary developments==
===Catholic–Orthodox dialogue===
The mutual anathemas (excommunications) of 1054, marking the Great Schism between Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) branches of Christianity, a process spanning several centuries, were revoked in 1965 by Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The Catholic Church does not regard Orthodox Christians as excommunicated, since they personally have no responsibility for the separation of their churches. In fact, Catholic rules admit the Orthodox to communion and the other sacraments in situations where the individuals are in danger of death or no Orthodox churches exist to serve the needs of their faithful. However, Orthodox churches still generally regard Roman Catholics as excluded from the sacraments and some may even not regard Catholic sacraments such as baptism and ordination as valid.

In November 2006, Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Istanbul at the invitation of Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople and participated in the feast day services of St. Andrew the First Apostle, the patron saint of the Church of Constantinople. The Ecumenical Patriarch and Pope Benedict had another historic meeting in Ravenna, Italy in 2007. The Declaration of Ravenna marked a significant rapprochement between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox positions. The declaration recognized the bishop of Rome as the Protos, or first among equals of the Patriarchs. This acceptance and the entire agreement was hotly contested by the Russian Orthodox Church. The signing of the declaration highlighted the pre-existing tensions between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate. Besides their theological concerns, the Russian Orthodox have continuing concerns over the question of the Eastern Catholic Churches that operate in what they regard as Orthodox territory. This question has been exacerbated by disputes over churches and other property that the Communist authorities once assigned to the Orthodox Church but whose restoration these Churches have obtained from the present authorities.

A major obstacle to improved relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches has been the insertion of the Latin term filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed in the 8th and 11th centuries. This obstacle has now been effectively resolved. The Catholic Church now recognizes that the Creed, as confessed at the First Council of Constantinople, did not add &quot;and the Son&quot;, when it spoke of the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father. When quoting the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, as in the 6 August 2000 document &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;, it does not include &quot;filioque&quot;. It views as complementary the Eastern-tradition expression &quot;who proceeds from the Father&quot; (profession of which it sees as affirming that he comes from the Father through the Son) and the Western-tradition expression &quot;who proceeds from the Father and the Son&quot;, with the Eastern tradition expressing firstly the Father&#x27;s character as first origin of the Spirit, and the Western tradition giving expression firstly to the consubstantial communion between Father and Son; and it believes that, provided this legitimate complementarity does not become rigid, it does not affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed.

Continuing dialogues at both international and national level continues between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. A particularly close relationship has grown up between Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Both church leaders have in particular emphasized their common concern for refugees and persecuted Christians in the Middle East. The 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council that was held in Crete aroused great expectations for advances in Church unity. However, not all Orthodox churches participated and, as a result, the Russian Patriarch refused to recognize the council as a truly ecumenical gathering. A major milestone in the growing rapprochement between the Catholic and Orthodox churches was the 12 February 2016 meeting held in Havana, Cuba between Patriarch Kirill and Pope Francis. The two church leaders issued a Joint Declaration of Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill at the conclusion of their discussions.

===Episcopal–Russian Orthodox dialogue===
The decision by the U.S. Episcopal Church to ordain Gene Robinson, an openly gay, non-celibate priest who advocates same-sex blessings, as bishop led the Russian Orthodox Church to suspend its cooperation with the Episcopal Church. Likewise, when the Church of Sweden decided to bless same-sex marriages, the Russian Patriarchate severed all relations with the Church, noting that &quot;Approving the shameful practice of same-sex marriages is a serious blow to the entire system of European spiritual and moral values influenced by Christianity.&quot;

===Inter-Christian===
Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev commented that the inter-Christian community is &quot;bursting at the seams&quot;. He sees the great dividing line—or &quot;abyss&quot;—not so much between old churches and church families as between &quot;traditionalists&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot;, the latter now dominating Protestantism, and predicted that other Northern Protestant Churches will follow suit and this means that the &quot;ecumenical ship&quot; will sink, for with the liberalism that is materializing in European Protestant churches, there is no longer anything to talk about.

Organizations such as the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches USA, Churches Uniting in Christ, Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship and Christian Churches Together continue to encourage ecumenical cooperation among Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, and, at times, Roman Catholics. There are universities such as the University of Bonn in Germany that offer degree courses in &quot;Ecumenical Studies&quot; in which theologians of various denominations teach their respective traditions and, at the same time, seek for common ground between these traditions.

The Global Christian Forum (GCF) was founded in 1998 following the proposal of the then General Secretary of the WCC, Rev. Konrad Raiser, that a new, independent space should be created where participants could meet on an equal basis to foster mutual respect and to explore and address together common concerns through a postmodern approach.

Influenced by the ecumenical movement, the &quot;scandal of separation&quot; and local developments, a number of United and uniting churches have formed; there are also a range of mutual recognition strategies being practiced where formal union is not feasible. An increasing trend has been the sharing of church buildings by two or more denominations, either holding separate services or a single service with elements of all traditions.

==Opposition to ecumenism==
===Catholics===
Most Traditionalist Catholics (such as Society of Saint Pius X, Society of Saint Pius V, Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen, Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary etc.) are almost universally opposed to ecumenism with other faith groups. Critics in the Catholic church are often critical of Vatican II documents that promote ecumenism, such as &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; and &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot;. Catholic opponents to ecumenism often cite preceding papal documents such as &quot;Mortalium Animos&quot; (1928) by Pope Pius XI, who considered the position that the Church of Christ can be divided into sections and that the Unity of the Church has not been achieved as a false opinion. Considering these notions, Pius XI continued &quot;[T]he Apostolic See cannot on any terms take part in [non-Catholic] assemblies, nor is it anyway lawful for Catholics either to support or to work for such enterprises; for if they do so they will be giving countenance to a false Christianity, quite alien to the one Church of Christ. Shall We suffer, what would indeed be iniquitous, the truth, and a truth divinely revealed, to be made a subject for compromise? For here there is question of defending revealed truth.&quot; Many traditional-leaning Catholics often strictly interpret the teaching of &quot;Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus&quot; (&quot;outside the Church there is no salvation&quot;), or that salvation can only be found in the Catholic Church.

In November 2015 Pope Francis stirred controversy among Catholics when he addressed a gathering of Lutherans in Rome regarding the issue of inter-communion. Addressing the issue as to whether a Lutheran woman married to a Catholic man and attended mass together could receive communion together, Francis said that while he could not give permission for her to receive communion, if she would pray about it and come forward he could not deny her communion. Cardinal Robert Sarah and Bishop Athanasius Schneider reacted to the pope&#x27;s comments saying it would almost never be acceptable for a non-Catholic to receive communion. On the matter of inter-communion Sarah said &quot;Inter-communion is not permitted between Catholics and non-Catholics. You must confess the Catholic Faith. A non-Catholic cannot receive Communion. That is very, very clear. It&#x27;s not a matter of following your conscience.&quot;

In early 2019 Barry C. Knestout, the 13th bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond, gave permission to the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia to ordain Susan B. Haynes as the new bishop at St. Bede Catholic Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. The Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia does not have a cathedral and usually rotates where it hosts ordinations and other events. However the announcement was met with opposition by many Catholics who objected to holding a non-Catholic worship service and women&#x27;s bishop ordination in a Catholic church. Over 3,000 people signed an internet petition objecting to the event. On 17 January the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia announced it would no longer hold Haynes&#x27; ordination at St. Bede.

===Lutherans===
Most churches following the doctrine of Confessional Lutheranism are generally strongly opposed to ecumenical activities. Most notably the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) bars its clergy from worshiping with other faiths, contending &quot;that church fellowship or merger between church bodies in doctrinal disagreement with one another is not in keeping with what the Bible teaches about church fellowship&quot;. In keeping with this position, a Connecticut LCMS pastor was asked to apologize by the president of the denomination, and did so, for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for the 26 children and adults killed at a Newtown elementary school; and a LCMS pastor in New York was suspended for praying at an interfaith vigil in 2001, twelve days after the September 11 attacks.

===Reformed Christians===
When the Manhattan Declaration was released, many prominent Evangelical figures—particularly of the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition—opposed it, including John F. MacArthur, D. James Kennedy, Alistair Begg, and R. C. Sproul.

===Anglicans/Episcopalians===
William David Walker, who was the first bishop of North Dakota (1883–1896), and Western New York (1897–1917), was strongly opposed to dialogue with other denominations. In his address to the 1914 Convention of the Diocese of Western New York, Walker said that &quot;in my opinion while divided Christendom remains, separated sects are better apart—each peaceably working out its own salvation.&quot;

===Methodists===
There are some members of the United Methodist Church who oppose ecumenical efforts which are &quot;not grounded in the doctrines of the Church&quot; due to concerns over theological compromise. For example, an article published in &quot;Catalyst Online: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives for United Methodist Seminarians&quot; stated that false ecumenism might result in the &quot;blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity&quot;.

The Evangelical Wesleyan Church, a Methodist connexion in the conservative holiness movement, teaches in its Book of Discipline that ecumenism with denominations that teach doctrines which contradict Wesleyan-Arminian theology should be avoided:
===Eastern Orthodox Christians===

Practically, &quot;the whole of Eastern Orthodoxy holds membership in the World Council of Churches&quot;. Ecumenical Patriarch Germanus V of Constantinople&#x27;s 1920 letter To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be&#x27;, urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a &#x27;League of Churches&#x27;, parallel to the newly founded League of Nations&quot; was an inspiration for the founding of the World Council of Churches. As such &quot;Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since.&quot;

Many Orthodox Christians support the cause of ecumenism as espoused by the Patriarch of Constantinople and their autocephalous Churches.

However, some of the Eastern Orthodox laity vehemently oppose ecumenism with other Christian denominations. Such people view ecumenism, as well as interfaith dialogue, as potentially pernicious to Eastern Orthodox Church tradition—as a &quot;weakening&quot; of Eastern Orthodoxy itself. In the Eastern Orthodox world, the Theological Committee of the Sacred Community of Mount Athos, arguably the most important center of Orthodox spirituality, has voiced its concerns regarding the ecumenist movement and has expressed opposition to the participation of the Eastern Orthodox Church. They regard modern ecumenism as compromising essential doctrinal stands in order to accommodate other Christians, and object to the emphasis on dialogue leading to intercommunion rather than conversion on the part of participants in ecumenical initiatives. Greek Old Calendarists also claim that the teachings of the Seven Ecumenical Councils forbid changing the church calendar through abandonment of the Julian calendar. The Inter-Eastern Orthodox Theological Conference entitled &quot;Ecumenism: Origins, Expectations, Disenchantment&quot;, organized in September 2004 by the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, drew negative conclusions on ecumenism. Russian Orthodox bishop Tikhon (Shevkunov) has strongly criticised ecumenism, especially with the Catholic Church, saying &quot;Catholics are not even a church and as a result not even Christian.&quot;

Fr. Timothy Evangelinidis of the Orthodox Research Institute notes, &quot;Orthodoxy also sees itself in a fragile position within the Ecumenical Movement. It is neither completely at home within ecumenism, nor is closed to other Christian groups wishing to dialogue with it.&quot; Opposition to ecumenism in the Orthodox Church has its roots in the teachings of many modern-day saints and monastics. For example, the popular Greek Saint, Elder Ephraim of Katounakia (died 1998), said when asked about ecumenism, &quot;I went to my cell and prayed, asking Christ to inform me what Ecumenism is. I received his reply, which was that Ecumenism has a spirit of wickedness and is dominated by unclean spirits.&quot; Similarly, the well-known Saint Paisios of Mount Athos (died 1994) gave many teachings about ecumenism. In a private letter to a priest named Fr. Haralambos on 23 January 1969, Elder Paisios wrote, &quot;With sadness I must write that among all the unionists [ecumenists] I&#x27;ve met, never have I seen them to have either a drop or shred of spirituality.&quot; Opposition to ecumenism comes not only from the laity and from monastics, but also from the Orthodox clergy. The popular ROCOR metropolitan Philaret of New York (died 1985) wrote a series of three &quot;sorrowful&quot; epistles from 1969 to 1975 against ecumenism, in which he called ecumenism an &quot;error&quot;. The anti-ecumenical words of such prominent and highly-respected figures in the Orthodox Church garners attention from many members of the clergy and laity.

=== Seventh-day Adventism ===

Some Seventh-day Adventists express a visceral rejection of ecumenism—apparently linked to a traditional Adventist dislike of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Political parties===

The state atheism of the former Eastern Bloc, which brought about a persecution of Christians, caused a rise in Christian nationalism in the West, as well as ecumenical cooperation among Christians across denominational lines. For example, the United States, in 1956, adopted &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as its official motto &quot;to differentiate itself from the Soviet Union, its Cold War enemy that was widely seen as promoting atheism.&quot; During this time, Christian human rights non-governmental organisations, such as Voice of the Martyrs, were founded in order to provide support to Christians persecuted in the Communist Bloc, also engaging in activities such as Bible smuggling. In the 1990s, the period surrounding the collapse of the Soviet Union led &quot;a surge in the activity of religious groups and interests among broad segments of the population&quot;. The revival of the Church occurred in these formerly Communist areas; Christian missionaries also entered the former Eastern Bloc in order to engage in evangelism there, winning people back to Christianity.

Christian democracy is a centrist political ideology inspired by Catholic social teaching and Neo-Calvinist theology. Christian democratic political parties came to prominence after World War II after Roman Catholics and Protestants worked together to help rebuild war-torn Europe. From its inception, Christian Democracy fosters an &quot;ecumenical unity achieved on the religious level against the atheism of the government in the Communist countries&quot;.

==Ecumenical symbols==
===Ecumenical symbol===
The ecumenical symbol pre-dates the World Council of Churches (WCC), formed in 1948, but is incorporated into the official logo of the WCC and many other ecumenical organizations.

===Christian flag===
Although originating in the Wesleyan tradition, and most popular among mainline and evangelical Protestant churches, the &quot;Christian Flag&quot; stands for no creed or denomination, but for Christianity. With regard to the Christian symbolism of the flag:
An ecumenical Christian organization, the Federal Council of Churches (now succeeded by the National Council of Churches and Christian Churches Together), adopted the flag on 23 January 1942.

== Conflation of ecumenism with interfaith dialogue ==
According the Roman Catholic Church, ecumenism refers to cooperation or efforts towards unity among Christian denominations, while interfaith dialogue (interreligious dialogue) refers to developing an understanding between Christianity and non-Christian religious, such as Hinduism and Shintoism.

<doc id="146657" wikidata="Q6738536" url="?curid=146657" title="Mak-yek">
<text>Mak-yek (, ) is a two-player abstract strategy board game played in Thailand and Myanmar. Players move their pieces as in the rook in chess and attempt to capture their opponent&#x27;s pieces through custodian and intervention capture. The game may have been first described in literature by Captain James Low a writing contributor in the 1839 work &quot;Asiatic Researches; or, Transactions of the Society, Instituted in Bengal, For Inquiring into The History, The Antiquities, The Arts and Sciences, and Literature of Asian, Second Part of the Twentieth Volume&quot; in which he wrote chapter X &quot;On Siamese Literature&quot; and documented the game as Maak yék. Another early description of the game is by H.J.R. Murray in his 1913 work &quot;A History of Chess&quot;, and the game was written as Maak-yek.

== Setup ==
The game is played on an 8 by 8 square board by two players each having a set of sixteen pieces or &quot;men&quot;, and with each set distinguishable from the other by color or design.

Men are laid out on the first and third row from the player.

== Rules ==
* There is no special way of deciding who starts the game. 
* Players take turns moving one of their men horizontally or vertically like the rook in chess (i.e. not through pieces), capturing the opponent&#x27;s pieces through custodian capture and intervention capture. The captured pieces are removed immediately from the board.
* Intervention capture is the opposite of custodian. If a piece moves between two enemy pieces that are one square apart on a row or column, it captures both pieces.
* The first player with no pieces left loses.

== Variants ==



=== Apit-sodok ===
A Malaysian variant called Apit-sodok is closely related. The game is documented in R.J. Wilkinson&#x27;s work &quot;Papers on Malay Subjects&quot; (1910), and Raja Samusah&#x27;s article &quot;The Malay Game of Apit&quot; (1932), and both refer to the game as Apit. Samusah also refers to the game as Sodok Apit. Both authors describe custodian and intervention capture, but only Samusah describes orthogonal movement of pieces as in the rook in chess. Samusah specifically describes that a line of enemy pieces can be captured through custodian whereas in Mak-yek only a single enemy piece may be captured. But Captain James Low&#x27;s description of Maak yék does include custodian capture for a line of enemy pieces. Samusah describes that a corner piece cannot be captured by surrounding it on its two adjacent squares and the diagonally adjacent square. He also describes that a piece can move safely next to a friendly piece(s) (on a row or column) despite being flanked as a linear group on two opposite ends by opposing pieces provided there are no spaces between any of them (friendly and opposing pieces). Both Wilkinson and Samusah agree that the game is played on a draughts board, and Samusah specifically illustrates an 8 x 8 uncheckered board similar to most versions of Mak-yek. Samusah describes that &quot;There are 16 pieces, all of equal value; and these are arranged in two rows as in chess&quot;, but does not specifically reference the chess variant. Malaysia&#x27;s chess variant is called Main Chator, and the pieces are set up on the first two rows nearest each player similar to Western chess. This is a contrast as to how Mak-yek&#x27;s pieces are initially set up which are on the first and third row nearest each player. As an English translation from the Malay language, apit means squeezed, and this is associated with custodian capture. Sodok means a shovel or spade or a duck&#x27;s bill, or the process of shoveling up, and this is associated with intervention capture.

=== Rek ===
A similar game is also played in Cambodia called Rek. The game is played on an 8 x 8 uncheckered square board with each player having 16 pieces similar to Mak-yek and Apit-sodok. One of the 16 pieces is a king, and the other 15 pieces are called men. The kings should be of the same color as their respective men, but distinguishable by size or design from them. The game begins with the 15 men situated on the first and third row (somewhat similar to Mak-yek) with only 7 men on the first row and 8 men on the third row. Each player&#x27;s king is situated on the very far left (or very far right) square of their respective second rows. The first row square directly below each king is left vacant. All pieces including the king move orthogonally any number of unobstructed squares on the board as in the rook of chess. The objective of each player is to capture the other player&#x27;s king. It thus resembles chess in this respect. It is not an elimination game as in Mak-yek and Apit-sodok, although elimination of all pieces does imply capture of the other player&#x27;s king. Intervention capture is the same as in Mak-yek and Apit-sodok, and it is called Rek from which the name of the game is derived from. A type of custodian capture is also featured in the game, but unlike Mak-yek and Apit-sodok where a player only has to flank the opponent&#x27;s piece(s) on two opposite sides, it requires the player performing the capture to completely surround an opponent&#x27;s piece or group of pieces with or without the aid of the edge(s) of the board, and in such a way that the pieces being captured cannot perform a legal move (hypothetically on the opponent&#x27;s next turn). Rek is a transitive verb which means &quot;carry on one&#x27;s shoulder a pole at each end of which is a container, bundle or object&quot;, and the two containers at each end of the pole are symbolic of the two pieces captured through intervention and are carried away by the player performing the capture. Rek is pronounced like rake but the k is silent. Another variant called Min Rek Chanh is also similarly related.

=== Gala ===
Another game that employs custodian capture is Gala from Sulawesi (formerly called Celebes), an island of Indonesia. The game was described by Harold James Ruthven Murray in &quot;A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess&quot; (1952) in which he references Walter Kaudern&#x27;s &quot;Ethnographical studies in Celebes: Results of the author’s expedition to Celebes 1917–20, vol. 4: Games and dances in Celebes.&quot; (1929) as his source, and Walter Kaudern in turn references Benjamin Frederik Matthes&#x27; &quot;Makassaarsch-Hollandsch Woordenboe&quot; (1859) and &quot;Ethnographische Atlas&quot; (1859) as his sources which are written in Dutch. Kaudern makes no attempt to translate the description and rules of the game from Matthes, and simply copies verbatim the passage from Matthes&#x27; book along with a diagram of the board. Murray attempts to describe it in English, although there may be a slight discrepancy with that of Matthe&#x27;s, but Matthe&#x27;s description may be unclear in some areas. Murray describes it as a two-player game played on a 7 x 7 square board of which the central square is marked with an X (or a cross) along with the middle square of each edge row (there are four edge rows, and they are the top-most and bottom-most ranks, and the left-most and right-most files of the board). This would describe a board containing five X&#x27;s. However, in Kaudern&#x27;s diagram of the board which is based upon Matthes&#x27;, there are nine X&#x27;s to be found on the board. The other four X&#x27;s are to be found on the four corner squares of the board. One player plays 10 black pieces, and the other player plays with 13 white pieces. The game begins with an empty board. Black moves first and places one piece on the central square (which is called the soelisañgka by the Bugis people of Sulawesi). Murray states that play continues with each player alternating their turns placing one of their pieces on their half of the board (Matthes does not specifically mention that pieces are entered one at a time, although that may have been his intent). Matthes specifically mentions that a player&#x27;s piece cannot be moved to the opponent&#x27;s half of the board until all of their pieces have been entered on the board. Murray describes that pieces move orthogonally any number of unoccupied spaces as in the Rook in Chess, and never diagonally. Murray describes that pieces are captured by interception (custodian method) in which a single enemy piece is flanked on two orthogonally opposite sides by two pieces of the player performing the capture. Murray states that when one player has hemmed in all of the other player&#x27;s pieces, that is, the other player&#x27;s pieces are prevented from performing a legal move on their turn, the situation is called a &quot;pōle&quot; by the Bugis, and &quot;bāttoe-mi nāi&quot; by the Makassars of Sulawesi.

Gala should not be confused by another game of the same name which is a chess variant played in Northern Germany.

== Second version of Mak-yek ==
Both Captain James Low and H.J.R. Murray described a second version of Mak-yek which resembles more of a hunt game where one player possesses only one piece, and goes against another player with sixteen pieces. The player with one piece can move in any direction except diagonally, and capture a single enemy piece by leaping over it as long as there is an empty square behind it. No more detail of the game&#x27;s rules is provided, but it does appear that the game is played on the same 8 x 8 square board since both authors make no attempt to describe a different board. If it is not the same board, it is at the very least a square board of some dimension since both authors describe that the single piece can leap over one of the sixteen pieces provided it lands on an empty &quot;square&quot; behind the leapt piece. If this is indeed a hunt game, it is a contrast to most hunt games from around the world and especially in Southeast Asia where most hunt game boards are of a linear pattern. It also would not be a variant of the first version of Mak-yek which is definitely not a hunt game.

== Classification ==
Mak-yek, Apit-sodok, Rek, and Min Rek Chanh are all played on an 8 × 8 square board with each player having sixteen pieces, exhibit intervention capture and custodian capture (or a modified custodian in the case of Rek and Min Rek Chanh), and pieces move like the Rook in Chess with the exception of the kings in Min Rek Chanh; furthermore, captured pieces are immediately removed from the board (as opposed to being converted into the capturing player&#x27;s pieces as in Ming Mang and a few others). These commonalities suggest that they may form a subfamily within the family of games that also includes Jul-Gonu, Hasami shogi, Dai hasami shogi, Ming Mang, Gundru, Seega, Ludus latrunculorum, Petteia, and Firdawsi’s Nard. They also bear resemblance to the Tafl games which exhibit custodian capture and rook-like movement of pieces except that the Tafl games are asymmetrical in the number and type of pieces each player possess, and the objective in Tafl games is for one player to move their king to the edge of the board with the objective of the other player to capture that king. They distantly resemble Agon, Awithlaknakwe, Bizingo, Watermelon Chess, Reversi, and Othello as all of these games exhibit custodian capture or some form of it. They may also distantly resemble Wéiqí, Baduk, and Go as these games also have a capturing method resembling custodian.

Rek and Min Rek Chanh&#x27;s &quot;custodian&quot; capturing method resembles that of Watermelon Chess where the player performing the capture must completely surround their opponent&#x27;s piece (or possibly pieces as in the case of Rek) with or without the aid of the edge(s) of the board, and in such a way that the captured piece(s) cannot perform a legal move (hypothetically on the opponent&#x27;s next turn). The capturing method also resembles that of Wéiqí, Baduk, and Go.

Rek and Min Rek Chanh may be classified as chess variants since the objective is to capture the other player&#x27;s king.

Since Gala utilizes custodian capture and an n x n square board that is uncheckered, it is therefore related to Mak-yek, Apit-sodok, Rek, and Minh Rek Chanh. But Gala differs greatly in many ways. Firstly, its board is smaller with 7 x 7 squares since the board is thought to be originally used for a race-game according to Murray. Secondly, the number of pieces each player has is different, with the Black player only having 10 pieces and the White player having 13 pieces. Thirdly, the board is empty in the beginning of the game thus requiring a drop phase before a movement phase begins. Moreover, the first move of the game (which is made by Black) is required to be placed on the central square. Lastly, there is no capture by intervention. 

The second version of Mak-yek might be a hunt game, but one of the more rare ones that use a square board as in Fox and Hounds, except in Fox and Hounds capture by leap (or any form of capture) is not allowed, but in Mak-yek it is allowed.

<doc id="146660" wikidata="Q1161896" url="?curid=146660" title="Bughouse chess">
<text>Bughouse chess (also known as exchange chess, Siamese chess (but not to be confused with Thai chess), tandem chess, transfer chess, double bughouse, doubles chess, cross chess, swap chess or simply bughouse, bugsy, or bug) is a popular chess variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two. Normal chess rules apply, except that captured pieces on one board are passed on to the teammate on the other board, who then has the option of putting these pieces on their board.

The game is usually played at a fast time control. Together with the passing and dropping of pieces, this can make the game look chaotic to the casual onlooker, hence the name bughouse, which is slang for mental hospital. Yearly, several dedicated bughouse tournaments are organized on a national and an international level.

== History ==
The absolute origin of Bughouse chess is currently unknown, but it rose to prominence in chess circles in the 1960s. There are references to four-player chess with two boards in German chess articles going back to the 1820s, but there is no known direct connection. There are references to a bughouse-like game in the 1930&#x27;s, perhaps evolved by players like Alekhine, who visited Japan and witnessed Shogi.

== Rules ==
Bughouse is a chess variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two. Each team member faces one opponent of the other team. Partners sit next to each other and one player per team has black pieces, while the other has white pieces. Each player plays the opponent as in a standard chess game, with the exception of the rules specified below.

=== Captured pieces ===
A player capturing a piece immediately passes that piece to their partner. The partner keeps these pieces in their reserve and may, on their turn, instead of playing a regular move, place one of these pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called &quot;dropping&quot; the piece. Pieces in reserve may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last . (A variant does not allow dropped pieces to deliver check.) Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move, and, if it lands directly next to an enemy pawn, be captured en passant. A rook placed on the rook&#x27;s typical starting square (a1, h1, a8, h8) may take part in castling. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces on the table in front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.

=== Clock and completion of a move ===
Bughouse chess is usually played with chess clocks to prevent players from waiting indefinitely to be passed a piece. Clocks are placed on the outside of the adjacent boards so that all players can see both clocks. At the start of the game, the players with the black pieces start the clocks simultaneously. Bughouse is usually played using , meaning players are committed to a move only after pressing the clock. is practiced to a lesser extent. When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.

Bughouse can be played without a clock, but then there is usually a rule preventing a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely. One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond the time that it takes for their partner to make three moves.

=== End of the game ===
The match ends when the game on either board ends. A game is won when one player gets checkmated, resigns, runs out of time, or makes an illegal move. The match can be drawn by agreement or when two players on opposite teams run out of time or are checkmated simultaneously. Threefold repetition may apply to a single board; however, players should be mindful that if the reserve of pieces is taken into account (e.g., even if one board repeats the same position after three moves), it is not a draw if the piece reserve changes. Internet Chess Club considers the reserve pieces in evaluating threefold repetition, but both FICS and chess.com rule a draw by threefold repetition on the board without considering the reserve pieces.

Alternatively, when one board finishes, play can continue on the other board. In this case, pieces in reserve can still be dropped, but no new pieces are coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.

=== Communication ===
Partners are normally allowed to talk to each other during the game. They can, for instance, ask for a specific piece, for more trades, ask to hold a piece, suggest moves or ask their partner to stall. Shouts like &quot;Knight mates!&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t give up a Bishop!&quot; are common and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.

== Two-player and six-player variations ==
It is possible to play the game with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to simultaneous chess, this way of playing the game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse. It can also be played with just one clock by playing the boards in a specific order (White A, White B, Black B, Black A) and pressing the clock after each move. This variation is suitable for correspondence play.

Bughouse can be played with three or more boards. The game is played in exactly the same way as normal bughouse with boards placed with alternating colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player may have to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three-board bughouse chess, the middle player is the key since they get material from two boards, but have to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of extra pieces available.

== Strategy ==

=== Material ===
In chess, a minor material advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, there is no endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. It is common to sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending, or hunting down a certain piece which one&#x27;s partner requires.

The material balance of a position can be calculated by adding up the piece values of each player&#x27;s pieces. In standard chess, a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are a consequence of the difference in mobility of the pieces. Bughouse piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can, for instance, be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which further adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They are also more likely to be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by the popular and one-time highest rated bughouse player André Nilsson of Sweden (&quot;Gnejs&quot; on ICC, FICS, and chess.com), often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.

=== Coordination ===
Captured pieces are passed on, and thus what happens on one board influences what happens on the other board. It is, therefore, natural for team members to communicate during game play. A common request of an attacking player would be &quot;trades are good,&quot; while players in trouble may ask their partners to hold trades with &quot;trades are bad.&quot; Similarly, a player can request a piece (e.g. &quot;knight wins a queen&quot;) or ask their partner to hold a piece (e.g. &quot;rook mates me&quot;).

Another common situation in the interplay between the two boards is a player not moving, a strategy known as sitting or stalling. Stalling can happen in anticipation of a certain piece or at the request of the partner. If, for example, a player is under heavy attack, and an additional pawn would mate them, but their partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on the next move, sitting is the only strategy. It would, however, be perfectly logical for the attacker to sit as well, waiting for a pawn to come. The situation where diagonal opponents sit at the same time is known as a &quot;sitzkrieg&quot; (literally &quot;sitting war&quot; in German, and a pun on &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;). The difference in time between the diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move. This diagonal time advantage is more important than the difference on the clock between opponents on the same board. At the higher levels (&gt;2000), players move very quickly, especially in the opening, as a time advantage of as little as 10 seconds can be more important than seemingly decisive positional advantages.

Apart from active communication, a good bughouse player tries to coordinate silently by keeping an eye on the other board and adapting moves accordingly. This can mean as little as glancing at the other board before trading queens, or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board.

=== Attack and defense ===
Attacking the king can mean checking the opponent but also controlling vital squares around the king. It is an essential part of bughouse gameplay. From a player&#x27;s perspective, attacking the king has important advantages as opposed to defending or attempting to win material:
* Because of the possibility of dropping pieces, attacks in bughouse can quickly lead to checkmate.
* The attacking player has the initiative; the attacker controls the board, while their opponent is left to react. This fact has important consequences for the other board as well.
* It is easier to attack than to defend. A defensive mistake can have bigger consequences than an offensive mistake. Thus, the defender needs to be more precise, which, in turn, can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.
* It is common to sacrifice material to build up or sustain an attack. Characteristic of attacks is the so-called &quot;piece storm&quot;, where a player drops piece after piece with check. Contact checks and knight checks, which force the king to move as opposed to dropping pieces, are especially important. They can be used to drive the king into the open, away from its defenders, while they prevent the opponent from putting new material on the board.

Partner communication is essential in a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner should be aware of which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important for the defending player to play quickly. Often, accepting a sacrifice can be lethal, while, on the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with and the defender&#x27;s partner having a piece more. Sacrifices, therefore, give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.

=== Opening ===
There are significantly fewer bughouse openings than there are chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is, for instance, not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available after the first few moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.

== Notation and sample game ==
The algebraic chess notation for chess can be used to record moves in bughouse games.
Different notations for piece drops are possible. The internet chess servers FICS and Internet Chess Club use the at-sign @, as in N@f1 (knight drop at f1), Q@e6+ (queen drop with check at e6) or P@h7# (pawn drop with checkmate at h7).

Because of the fast pace at which the game is played, bughouse games are rarely recorded
in games played over the board. With the arrival of online chess it has become possible to systematically record games. The format in which this is done is the bughouse portable game notation (BPGN), an extension of the Portable Game Notation for chess. Software such as BPGN viewer can be used to replay and analyse bughouse games. Below is an example bughouse game in the BPGN format.

== Types of play ==

=== Over the board ===
Little is known on the history of bughouse, but it seems to have developed in the early 1960s. It is now quite popular as a diversion of regular chess in local chess clubs throughout Europe and the US. Grandmasters such as Joel Benjamin, Yasser Seirawan, Andy Soltis, John Nunn, Jon Speelman, Sergey Karjakin, Michael Adams, Emil Sutovsky and Michael Rohde have been known to play the game. One of the strongest matches on record (in terms of chess players&#x27; ratings) took place following the 2014 Sinquefield Cup, with Magnus Carlsen and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave teaming up against Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian – all four being among the top ten chess players in the world at the time.

With the absence of an International Federation, over-the-board competitive bughouse is very much in its infancy. While there is no over-the-board world championship, an online world championship is sponsored by chess.com. Participants in the 2021 tournament included Grandmasters Nils Grandelius and Jeffery Xiong. Xiong, playing with partner catask (who had won the 2021 Crazyhouse World Championship), won the 2021 event. A few countries do organize bughouse tournaments within the national chess federation. Examples include:
* The yearly international chess festival Czech Open in July features the Czech republic bughouse championship.
* Yearly, USCF organizes bughouse tournaments as part of the National Junior High (K-9) Championship and the National High School (K-12) Championship.
Other tournaments are organized privately:
* One of the largest international bughouse tournaments is the yearly tournament in Berlin. Going into its sixth edition, it is popular among top players from FICS. Grandmaster Levon Aronian took part in the 2005 edition of the tournament and took the second place with his teammate Vasiliy Shakov.
* Since 2000 there has been an annual bughouse tournament in Geneva, attracting the best European players.

=== Online ===
Since 1995, Bughouse has been available online at chess servers such as FICS and ICC and, as of 2016, at Chess.com. FICS was historically the most active server for bughouse, attracting the world&#x27;s best players like Levon Aronian, but it is much more likely to find a game more quickly at chess.com.

The game is played online in the same way as over the board, but some aspects are unique to online bughouse. In games over the board, communication is heard by all players, while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between two partners. This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board. The time aspect is altered due to existence of premove and lag. The latter can influence the diagonal time difference significantly, and it is good sportsmanship to restart the game when this difference gets too large.

ICS compatible interfaces particularly suitable for bughouse include Thief and BabasChess. They have the ability to display both boards at the same time and store played or observed games; they also have partner communication buttons and a lag indicator. Special Chess Engine Communication Protocol compatible engines have been written that support bughouse, examples are Sunsetter, Sjeng and TJchess. Although much faster than humans, they lack in positional understanding and especially in coordination and communication, an essential skill in this team game.

In 2016, bughouse was introduced as a part of new version of Chess.com with browser-based play.

====World Championship====
Chess.com has hosted an annual Bughouse World Championship with a prize fund. Winners have included:
* 2023: GM Lars Hauge &amp; GM Guillermo Vazquez
* 2022: Awonder Liang &amp; Jeffery Xiong
* 2021: Awonder Liang &amp; Jeffery Xiong
* 2020: FM Daniel Yeager &amp; Janak Awatramani

== Controversy ==
Bughouse chess is controversial among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most do not consider it to have a positive effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, &quot;If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But just remember that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess. In fact, I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament.&quot; Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. For example, in bughouse, one can just drop a pawn to compensate for a weakness created by moving one, unlike normal chess. It also lacks endgame play due to pieces being recycled, thereby reducing the need for precise moves. In addition, the lack of control over teammates&#x27; boards introduces randomness that is not encountered in normal chess. Further, many claim that since there is no set order of moves between the two boards, normal calculation ability is diminished. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one&#x27;s opponent will be moving quickly.

Levon Aronian is among those who view bughouse as beneficial &quot;for players who know chess well already. ... I started to play bug when I was already at master level, [you] see, and I think bughouse is good for the imagination, to develop new ideas.&quot; For Joel Benjamin, bughouse trains players to pay closer attention to empty squares on the board.

*Oware, the national game of Ghana, is also known by Warri, Ayo (Yoruba Name. Nigeria), Awele, Awari, Ouril, and other names. It has relatively simple rules but considerable strategic depth. The board is 2×6 (not counting optional stores).
*Omweso (also known as &quot;coro&quot;) is a strategic game of Uganda, played on a 4×8 board.
*Pallanguzhi is played in Tamil nadu, Southern India with 2 x 7 stores. Two varieties of this game are popular, Kaashi and Bank.

<text>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language is a 1997 book by Douglas Hofstadter in which he explores the meaning, strengths, failings and beauty of translation. The book is a long and detailed examination of translations of a minor French poem and, through that, an examination of the mysteries of translation (and indeed more generally, language and consciousness) itself. Hofstadter himself refers to it as &quot;my ruminations on the art of translation&quot;.

The title itself is a pun, revealing many of the themes of the work: means &#x27;the beautiful tone&#x27; or &#x27;the sweet tone&#x27;, but the word order is unusual for French. It would be more common to write . A French speaker hearing the title spoken () would be more likely to interpret it as &quot;le tombeau de Marot&quot;; where may mean &#x27;tomb&#x27; (as per the cover picture), but also &quot;tombeau&quot;, &#x27;a work of art (literature or music) done in memory and homage to a deceased person&#x27; (the title is intended to parallel the title of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot;). In a further play on the title, Hofstadter refers to his deceased wife Carol, to whom the book is dedicated, as (&quot;my rose&quot;), and to himself as (&quot;your dear&quot;).

At the surface level, the book treats the difficulties and rewards of translating works (particularly poetry) from one language to another. Diverse translations (usually to English) of a short poem in Renaissance French, Clément Marot&#x27;s &quot;A une Damoyselle malade&quot; (referred to as &quot;&#x27;Ma mignonne&quot;&#x27; by Hofstadter), serve as reference points for his ideas on the subject. Groups of translations alternate with analysis and commentary on the same throughout the book. However, Hofstadter&#x27;s reading of the idea of &#x27;translation&#x27; goes deeper than simply that of translating between languages. Translation between frames of reference—languages, cultures, modes of expression or, indeed, between one person&#x27;s thoughts and another—becomes an element in many of the same concepts Hofstadter has addressed in prior works, such as reference and self-reference, structure and function, and artificial intelligence.

One theme of this book is the loss of Hofstadter&#x27;s wife Carol, who died of a brain tumor while the book was being written; she also created one of the numerous translations of Marot&#x27;s poem presented in the book. In this context the poem, dedicated to &#x27;a sick lady&#x27;, gained yet another deeply tragic and personal meaning, even though the translations were started long before her illness was even known (Hofstadter went on to follow with an even more personal book titled &quot;I Am a Strange Loop&quot; after the death of his wife).

<doc id="146672" wikidata="Q1421063" url="?curid=146672" title="Fistful of Metal">
<text>Fistful of Metal is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax, released in January 1984 by Megaforce Records (US only) and Music for Nations internationally. The album includes a cover of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot;. This is the band&#x27;s only album to feature vocalist Neil Turbin and original bassist Dan Lilker, who were replaced by Matt Fallon (and eventually by seventh vocalist Joey Belladonna) and Frank Bello, respectively. Former original guitarist Greg Walls claims that Anthrax &quot;ripped him off&quot; as he claims he wrote the material on the album.

==Background==
Schoolmates Danny Lilker and Scott Ian formed Anthrax in 1981 in New York City. They both played guitar, but Lilker switched to bass when they could not find a suitable bassist. In 1982, after some lineup rotations, Anthrax added vocalist and fellow schoolmate Neil Turbin. Drummer Charlie Benante and lead guitarist Dan Spitz were added in 1983. Anthrax recorded a five-track demo in early 1983, which led to the band signing with Jon Zazula&#x27;s Megaforce Records. The label issued a seven-inch single of &quot;Soldiers of Metal / Howling Furies&quot;, which sold 3,000 copies in two weeks. &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; was recorded in Pyramid Sound Studios in Ithaca, New York and produced by Carl Canedy, drummer in The Rods. The album was released in January 1984 by Megaforce in the US, Music for Nations in the UK, and Roadrunner in Europe.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;, Lilker was fired by Turbin who didn&#x27;t inform the rest of the band about his decision. In Lilker&#x27;s own words &quot;After I was thrown out, the guys unfairly said, &quot;Well, it took him 30 times to record the bass track for &#x27;I&#x27;m Eighteen,&#x27;&quot; and if you listen to the bass track, if you didn&#x27;t know the whole story, you would say, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s weird, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; It&#x27;s only, like, five notes.&quot; The band, at Ian and Benante&#x27;s insistence, hired Charlie&#x27;s nephew, Frank Bello, as Lilker&#x27;s replacement. Turbin had contributed song ideas, lyrics, titles and arrangements to most songs on the album, as well as three songs from the second album &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, but Ian and Benante, who played guitar in addition to drums, felt they needed tighter control on the songwriting. Due to a songwriting partnership between Ian and Benante, with Ian wanting to be more of a central focal point he began writing the lyrics and Benante the music, Turbin was forced out of the band a few weeks after the Roseland Ballroom show with Metallica. Music journalist Eddie Trunk stated: &quot;Early on, I told Jon Zazula that what I didn&#x27;t like about Anthrax was singer Neil Turbin&#x27;s vocals.&quot; He admits in his writing to pressuring Zazula and Anthrax into firing Turbin from the band. The band did not rehire Lilker when given the opportunity and instead opted for then Anthrax roadie Frank Bello. Former guitarist Greg Walls said he was shocked that the album was released without giving credit to Walls as the primary songwriter on &quot;Panic&quot; and &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;, as well as smaller songwriting contributions throughout the album.

==Release==
&quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; was released in January 1984. It was released as a double album by Music for Nations in the UK, featuring extra mixes of &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot; and &quot;Howling Furies&quot;, which were not included on the US edition. Megaforce repackaged a compilation of &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; and the 1985 extended play &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; in 2005, which featured a different artwork and some liner notes, but excluded any new mixes and bonus tracks. Commemorating its 25th anniversary, Megaforce reissued the album on three colored 10-inch LPs, also including &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical reception to &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; was mixed. Xavier Russel of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called it a great debut album, with songs played &quot;at a hundred miles an hour&quot; which could just have been &quot;slightly more original.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin called the cover art &quot;tasteless&quot;, but commended the album&#x27;s small, but steady commercial performance. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said Anthrax had not found its distinctive style yet, sounding more like a Judas Priest cover band. Huey found the lyrics utilizing heavy metal stereotypes and opined fans would find the record &quot;off-putting&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the well-produced sound and the &quot;almost operatic anti-thrash vocals&quot; from Turbin, considering the album responsible for &quot;putting New York back on the US metal map, and quality back in the books of bruising and uncompromising underground metal.&quot; The term &quot;thrash metal&quot; was used for the first time in the music press by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; journalist Malcolm Dome, referring to the song &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;.

&quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine placed the album on their list of &quot;New Sensations: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1984&quot;. In June 2019, Decibel inducted &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; in their Hall of Fame, due to its reputation as one of the best early examples of thrash metal.

Despite its acclaim, &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; is considered to be one of Anthrax&#x27;s least represented studio albums. Most of the songs from the album have rarely been played live since the band rose to popularity with their next two albums, &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; and &quot;Among the Living&quot;, although &quot;Deathrider&quot;, &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;, &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot;, &quot;Anthrax&quot; and &quot;Across the River&quot; have seen periodic revivals in later years. No songs from this album have ever appeared on any of the band&#x27;s compilation albums, including &quot;Return of the Killer A&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, though they did re-record the heavily requested &quot;Deathrider&quot;, &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;, &quot;Panic&quot;, and &quot;Anthrax&quot; for their 2004 album &quot;The Greater of Two Evils&quot; (the latter appearing on the 2-disc Japanese version as a bonus track).

In 1986, the album was banned in Germany by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons for its violent cover artwork. The ban has since expired.

<doc id="146675" wikidata="Q1416787" url="?curid=146675" title="Spreading the Disease">
<text>Spreading the Disease is the second studio album by the American thrash metal band Anthrax. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature vocalist Joey Belladonna and bassist Frank Bello. A special two-disc edition of the album was released in 2015, celebrating its 30th anniversary.

==Background and writing==
After Anthrax finished touring in support of &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;, vocalist Neil Turbin was expelled from the band. Matt Fallon replaced him, but was quickly fired because he lacked confidence in the studio. Producer Carl Canedy suggested the group to audition Joey Belladonna, who was not familiar with thrash metal. Though the band members were not pleased with Belladonna&#x27;s musical background, they hired him and booked a few shows with their new frontman. &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; was recorded at the Pyramid Sound Studios in Ithaca, New York with Canedy, while Jon Zazula served as executive producer. The album featured the single &quot;Madhouse&quot;, for which a music video was produced, but it did not receive much airplay on MTV, because the station believed the content was degrading to people with mental illnesses.

&quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; was the band&#x27;s major label debut and was released by Megaforce / Island Records. It was the last Anthrax album to feature songwriting from Turbin. This was also the first to feature songwriting from bassist Dan Lilker after his departure from the band, though more of his songwriting would be featured on the following album, &quot;Among the Living&quot;. Turbin wrote the lyrics for &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Gung-Ho&quot;, and Lilker contributed to the music. Zazula was given songwriting credit for &quot;Medusa&quot;, his only contribution for Anthrax. Zazula was originally credited as the sole writer of the song, but album reissues credit the rest of the band as well. Former vocalist Matt Fallon, who left during the recording sessions, claimed in a 2016 interview that he contributed to the lyrics but was left uncredited. The band has not commented on these accusations.

After recording &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, guitarist Scott Ian, drummer Charlie Benante and Lilker, who had joined Nuclear Assault, founded the Stormtroopers of Death and recorded the crossover thrash album &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;.

In his autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;m the Man: The Story of That Guy from Anthrax&quot; (2014: 91), Scott Ian said the acronym in the song &quot;A.I.R.&quot; stands for &quot;Adolescence in Red&quot; and that it was a wordplay of his on George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. The outro of &quot;Gung-Ho&quot; is a rondo from &quot;Sinfonie de Fanfares&quot; by the Baroque composer Jean-Joseph Mouret.

==Cover art==
The cover art was made by Peter Corriston and Dave Heffernon, who had worked on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; sleeve. Benante came up with the concept of a man being investigated for radiation levels.

==Reception==

&quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; was released on October 30, 1985, and received widespread acclaim by music critics. In a contemporary review, Howard Johnson of the British magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; recommended the album as the best example of thrash metal and equated Anthrax to Metallica in terms of songwriting capability.

More recently, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said the album was a great leap forward from its predecessor and one of Anthrax&#x27;s finest. He praised the lyrics for paying tribute to fictional characters as in &quot;Lone Justice&quot; and &quot;Medusa&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff calls the album &quot;a shocking blast of noise from a long-haired bunch of punks that knew their own business&quot;, praising the &quot;deceptively chaotic songcraft&quot; and Belladonna&#x27;s vocals. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Mike Stagno also liked Belladonna&#x27;s vocals, as well as the tight riffs of guitarists Ian and Spitz. Stagno said &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; had &quot;excellent&quot; sound and production and recommended the album for fans of thrash metal. Frank Trojan of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; wrote that &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; had more potential and intelligence than &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;, as well as more differentiated songs. British author Joel McIver described &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; as &quot;the sound of pure determination, at a point in metal history where boundaries were being pushed every day.&quot;

<text>Rolf Peter Ingvar Stormare (; né Storm, 27 August 1953) is a Swedish-American actor. He played Hamlet for Ingmar Bergman, Gaear Grimsrud in the film &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996) and John Abruzzi in the television series &quot;Prison Break&quot; (2005–2017). He has appeared in films including &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997), &quot;Playing God&quot; (1997), &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), &quot;8mm &quot;(1999), &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000), &quot;Windtalkers&quot; (2002), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; (2003), &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005), and &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; (2014), and the video games &quot;Destiny&quot; (2014), &quot;Until Dawn&quot; (2015), and &quot;Destiny 2&quot; (2017).

== Early life ==

Rolf Peter Ingvar Storm was born in Kumla, Sweden, on August 27, 1953. His family moved to Arbrå. He attended the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, where he studied acting. He changed his surname when he discovered he shared it with a senior student at acting academy. Before settling on Stormare, he briefly contemplated changing his name to Retep Mrots, which is &quot;Peter Storm&quot; backwards. &quot;Stormare&quot; means &quot;stormer&quot; in Swedish. Stormare starred in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;; Hilary DeVries of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote: &quot;in the electrifying lead performance by Peter Stormare, Hamlet is, for all his Angst-filled poses and dark glasses, no hamstrung cliche but Denmark&#x27;s only ballast between the debauched Claudius and the fascistic Fortinbras.&quot;

== Acting career ==
Stormare voiced Mattias Nilsson in the video games &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mercenaries 2: World in Flames&quot;, Isair in the video game &quot;Icewind Dale 2&quot;, and Johann Strauss in &quot;Quake 4&quot;. In February 2006, he starred as Wolfgang in Volkswagen&#x27;s VDub series of television commercials. He played the main character in the film &quot;Svartvattnet&quot;, which was filmed in Sweden and Norway in 2007. He was offered a role in the ABC television series &quot;Lost&quot; for a period of one year, which he declined. In the 2007 film &quot;Premonition&quot;, he played Dr. Roth. In April 2007, he appeared in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Ending Happy&quot;.

In 2011, he appeared alongside Kevin Spacey and Daniel Wu in the Chinese film &quot;Inseparable&quot;, which premiered at the 2011 Busan International Film Festival.

In 2014, he appeared in episodes of &quot;Longmire&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot;, and &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, and starred in the Eli Roth–produced film &quot;Clown&quot;.

In 2015, he voiced and motion-captured Dr. Alan J. Hill in the video game &quot;Until Dawn&quot;. In 2016, he played Rutger Burlin in the Swedish television series&quot; Midnattssol&quot;; he also co-created, and starred as Ingmar in, the web television series &quot;Swedish Dicks&quot;, which was renewed for a second season in October 2016. In 2017, he played a minor role in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; and the part of Czernobog on the Starz series &quot;American Gods&quot;. He played the vampire Godbrand in the Netflix animated series &quot;Castlevania&quot;. In 2019 he appeared in the music video of the song &quot;Graven&quot; by the U.S. death metal band Possessed.

== Music career ==
After Bono of U2 heard some of Stormare&#x27;s music, he encouraged Stormare to make an album. In 2002, Stormare released his first album, &quot;Dallerpölsa och småfåglar&quot;. He plays in a band called Blonde from Fargo and runs a record label called StormVox.

He appeared in the music video of the song &quot;Uprising&quot; by the Swedish power metal band Sabaton.

He appeared in the clips &quot;Steh Auf&quot; and &quot;Frau &amp; Mann&quot; of metal project Lindemann.

== Personal life ==
Stormare divides his time between the United States and Sweden. He married actress Karen Sillas in 1989, and they divorced in 2006. He married Toshimi Murakami, a native of Japan, in 2008. Their daughter Kaiya Bella Luna Stormare was born on May 9, 2009. They reside in Los Angeles. Stormare is a dual citizen of Sweden and the United States, naturalizing as an American citizen during the late 1990s.

Peter Stormare is the godfather of actor Gustaf Skarsgård.

Stormare is a Christian and has said that he has had contact with God. When he was young, he participated in Baptist meetings in Arbrå. He has a strong spiritual side, inherited from his mother, who he has said was a medium, and who supposedly inherited that ability from her own father.

<text>Military intelligence is a military discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to assist commanders in their decisions. This aim is achieved by providing an assessment of data from a range of sources, directed towards the commanders&#x27; mission requirements or responding to questions as part of operational or campaign planning. To provide an analysis, the commander&#x27;s information requirements are first identified, which are then incorporated into intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination.

Areas of study may include the operational environment, hostile, friendly and neutral forces, the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and other broader areas of interest. Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels, from tactical to strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during a war itself.

Most governments maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services. The military and civilian intelligence capabilities collaborate to inform the spectrum of political and military activities.

Personnel performing intelligence duties may be selected for their analytical abilities and personal intelligence before receiving formal training.

==Levels==

Intelligence operations are carried out throughout the hierarchy of political and military activity.

=== Strategic ===
Strategic intelligence is concerned with broad issues such as economics, political assessments, military capabilities and intentions of foreign nations (and, increasingly, non-state actors). Such intelligence may be scientific, technical, tactical, diplomatic or sociological, but these changes are analyzed in combination with known facts about the area in question, such as geography, demographics and industrial capacities.

Strategic Intelligence is formally defined as &quot;intelligence required for the formation of policy and military plans at national and international levels&quot;, and corresponds to the Strategic Level of Warfare, which is formally defined as &quot;the level of warfare at which a nation, often as a member of a
group of nations, determines national or multinational (alliance or coalition) strategic security objectives and guidance, then develops and uses national resources to achieve those objectives.&quot;

===Operational===
Operational intelligence is focused on support or denial of intelligence at operational tiers. The operational tier is below the strategic level of leadership and refers to the design of practical manifestation. Formally defined as &quot;Intelligence that is required for planning and conducting campaigns and major operations to accomplish strategic objectives within theaters or operational areas.&quot; It aligns with the Operational Level of Warfare, defined as &quot;The level of warfare at which campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted, and sustained to achieve strategic objectives within theaters or other operational areas.&quot;

The term &quot;operation intelligence&quot; is used within law enforcement to refer to intelligence that supports long-term investigations into multiple, similar targets. Operational intelligence, in the discipline of law enforcement intelligence, is concerned primarily with identifying, targeting, detecting and intervening in criminal activity. The use within law enforcement and law enforcement intelligence is not scaled to its use in general intelligence or military/naval intelligence, being more narrowed in scope.

===Tactical===
Tactical intelligence is focused on support to operations at the tactical level and would be attached to the battlegroup. At the tactical level, briefings are delivered to patrols on current threats and collection priorities. These patrols are then debriefed to elicit information for analysis and communication through the reporting chain.

Tactical Intelligence is formally defined as &quot;intelligence required for the planning and conduct of tactical operations&quot;, and corresponds with the Tactical Level of Warfare, itself defined as &quot;the level of warfare at which battles and engagements are planned and executed to achieve military objectives assigned to tactical units or task forces&quot;.

==Tasking==
Intelligence should respond to the needs of leadership, based on the military objective and operational plans. The military objective provides a focus for the estimate process, from which a number of information requirements are derived. Information requirements may be related to terrain and impact on vehicle or personnel movement, disposition of hostile forces, sentiments of the local population and capabilities of the hostile order of battle.

In response to the information requirements, analysts examine existing information, identifying gaps in the available knowledge. Where gaps in knowledge exist, the staff may be able to task collection assets to target the requirement.

Analysis reports draw on all available sources of information, whether drawn from existing material or collected in response to the requirement. The analysis reports are used to inform the remaining planning staff, influencing planning and seeking to predict adversary intent.

This process is described as Collection Co-ordination and Intelligence Requirement Management (CCIRM).

== Process ==
The process of intelligence has four phases: collection, analysis, processing and dissemination.

In the United Kingdom these are known as direction, collection, processing and dissemination.

In the U.S. military, Joint Publication 2-0 (JP 2–0) states: &quot;The six categories of intelligence operations are: planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; dissemination and integration; and evaluation and feedback.&quot;

=== Collection ===
Many of the most important facts are well known or may be gathered from public sources. This form of information collection is known as open-source intelligence. For example, the population, ethnic make-up and main industries of a region are extremely important to military commanders, and this information is usually public. It is however imperative that the collector of information understands that what is collected is &quot;information&quot;, and does not become intelligence until after an analyst has evaluated and verified this information. Collection of read materials, composition of units or elements, disposition of strength, training, tactics, personalities (leaders) of these units and elements contribute to the overall intelligence value &quot;after&quot; careful analysis.

The tonnage and basic weaponry of most capital ships and aircraft are also public, and their speeds and ranges can often be reasonably estimated by experts, often just from photographs. Ordinary facts like the lunar phase on particular days or the ballistic range of common military weapons are also very valuable to planning, and are habitually collected in an intelligence library.

A great deal of useful intelligence can be gathered from photointerpretation of detailed high-altitude pictures of a country. Photointerpreters generally maintain catalogs of munitions factories, military bases and crate designs in order to interpret munition shipments and inventories.

Most intelligence services maintain or support groups whose only purpose is to keep maps. Since maps also have valuable civilian uses, these agencies are often publicly associated or identified as other parts of the government. Some historic counterintelligence services, especially in Russia and China, have intentionally banned or placed disinformation in public maps; good intelligence can identify this disinformation.

It is commonplace for the intelligence services of large countries to read every published journal of the nations in which it is interested, and the main newspapers and journals of every nation. This is a basic source of intelligence.

It is also common for diplomatic and journalistic personnel to have a secondary goal of collecting military intelligence. For western democracies, it is extremely rare for journalists to be paid by an official intelligence service, but they may still patriotically pass on tidbits of information they gather as they carry on their legitimate business. Also, much public information in a nation may be unavailable from outside the country. This is why most intelligence services attach members to foreign service offices.

Some industrialized nations also eavesdrop continuously on the entire radio spectrum, interpreting it in real time. This includes not only broadcasts of national and local radio and television, but also local military traffic, radar emissions and even microwaved telephone and telegraph traffic, including satellite traffic.

The U.S. in particular is known to maintain satellites that can intercept cell-phone and pager traffic, usually referred to as the ECHELON system. Analysis of bulk traffic is normally performed by complex computer programs that parse natural language and phone numbers looking for threatening conversations and correspondents. In some extraordinary cases, undersea or land-based cables have been tapped as well.

More exotic secret information, such as encryption keys, diplomatic message traffic, policy and orders of battle are usually restricted to analysts on a need-to-know basis in order to protect the sources and methods from foreign traffic analysis.

=== Analysis ===
Analysis consists of assessment of an adversary&#x27;s capabilities and vulnerabilities. In a real sense, these are threats and opportunities. Analysts generally look for the least defended or most fragile resource that is necessary for important military capabilities. These are then flagged as critical vulnerabilities. For example, in modern mechanized warfare, the logistics chain for a military unit&#x27;s fuel supply is often the most vulnerable part of a nation&#x27;s order of battle.

Human intelligence, gathered by spies, is usually carefully tested against unrelated sources. It is notoriously prone to inaccuracy. In some cases, sources will just make up imaginative stories for pay, or they may try to settle grudges by identifying personal enemies as enemies of the state that is paying for the intelligence. However, human intelligence is often the only form of intelligence that provides information about an opponent&#x27;s intentions and rationales, and it is therefore often uniquely valuable to successful negotiation of diplomatic solutions.

In some intelligence organizations, analysis follows a procedure. First, general media and sources are screened to locate items or groups of interest, and then their location, capabilities, inputs and environment are systematically assessed for vulnerabilities using a continuously updated list of typical vulnerabilities.

=== Filing ===
Critical vulnerabilities are then indexed in a way that makes them easily available to advisors and line intelligence personnel who package this information for policy-makers and war-fighters. Vulnerabilities are usually indexed by the nation and military unit with a list of possible attack methods.

Critical threats are usually maintained in a prioritized file, with important enemy capabilities analyzed on a schedule set by an estimate of the enemy&#x27;s preparation time. For example, nuclear threats between the USSR and the U.S. were analyzed in real time by continuously on-duty staffs. In contrast, analysis of tank or army deployments are usually triggered by accumulations of fuel and munitions, which are monitored every few days. In some cases, automated analysis is performed in real time on automated data traffic.

Packaging threats and vulnerabilities for decision-makers is a crucial part of military intelligence. A good intelligence officer will stay very close to the policy-maker or war fighter to anticipate their information requirements and tailor the information needed. A good intelligence officer will also ask a fairly large number of questions in order to help anticipate needs. For an important policy-maker, the intelligence officer will have a staff to which research projects can be assigned.

Developing a plan of attack is not the responsibility of intelligence, though it helps an analyst to know the capabilities of common types of military units. Generally, policy-makers are presented with a list of threats and opportunities. They approve some basic action, and then professional military personnel plan the detailed act and carry it out. Once hostilities begin, target selection often moves into the upper end of the military chain of command. Once ready stocks of weapons and fuel are depleted, logistic concerns are often exported to civilian policy-makers.

=== Dissemination ===
The processed intelligence information is disseminated through database systems, intel bulletins and briefings to the different decision-makers. The bulletins may also include consequently resulting information requirements and thus conclude the intelligence cycle.

<text>Armed and Dangerous is the first EP by American heavy metal band Anthrax, released in February 1985 through Megaforce Records. The band produced the album with Carl Canedy and Jon Zazula acting as executive producer. This is the first Anthrax release to feature Joey Belladonna on vocals, and Frank Bello on bass guitar.

The 1992 issue includes the songs &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot; and &quot;Howling Furies&quot; as its last two tracks. The line-up for those two tracks is Neil Turbin, Scott Ian, Dan Spitz, Greg D&#x27;Angelo (except where Charlie Benante rerecorded the drums), and Dan Lilker. It was released as a double album (along with &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;) in (Germany) in 2000.

The song &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; also appears on the album &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; with a different mix, which does not include the fade-in intro leading into the initial acoustic guitar melody. That intro was omitted from the album version for unverified reasons but it is possible that it was for album continuity.

The song &quot;Raise Hell&quot; was an original Anthrax recording exclusive to the EP, and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was originally recorded by the Sex Pistols on the &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; album. Despite being marked as live versions, &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot; and &quot;Panic&quot; are studio re-recordings of tracks featured on the band&#x27;s debut album.
