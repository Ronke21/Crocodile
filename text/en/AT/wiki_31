<text>The Sarmatians (; ; Latin: ) were a large confederation of ancient Iranian equestrian nomadic peoples who dominated the Pontic steppe from about the 5th century BC to the 4th century AD. 

The earliest reference to the Sarmatians is in the Avesta, where they appear as &quot;Sairima-&quot;, which in later Iranian sources becomes &quot;*Sarm&quot; and &quot;Salm&quot;. Originating in the central parts of the Eurasian Steppe, the Sarmatians formed part of the wider Scythian cultures. They started migrating westward around the fourth and third centuries BC, coming to dominate the closely related Scythians by 200 BC. At their greatest reported extent, around 100 BC, these tribes ranged from the Vistula River to the mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga, bordering the shores of the Black and Caspian seas and the Caucasus to the south.

In the first century AD, the Sarmatians began encroaching upon the Roman Empire in alliance with Germanic tribes. In the third century AD, the Germanic Goths broke the Sarmatian dominance of the Pontic Steppe. With the Hunnic invasions of the fourth century, many Sarmatians joined the Goths and other Germanic tribes (Vandals) in settling in the Western Roman Empire. Since large parts of today&#x27;s Russia, specifically the land between the Ural Mountains and the Don River, were controlled in the fifth century BC by the Sarmatians, the Lower Volga–Don steppes are sometimes called the &quot;Sarmatian Motherland.&quot;

The Sarmatians in the Bosporan Kingdom assimilated into Greek civilization, while others were absorbed by the proto-Circassian Maeotian people, the Alans, and the Goths. Other Sarmatians were assimilated and absorbed by the Early Slavs. The Alans survived in the North Caucasus into the Early Middle Ages, ultimately giving rise to the modern Ossetic ethnic group. The Polish nobility claimed to stem from the Sarmatians. Genomic studies suggest that this group may have been genetically similar to the eastern Yamnaya Bronze Age group.

==Etymology==

The Greek name () is derived from the Old Iranic Sarmatian endonym or , of which another variant, , gave rise to the ancient Greek name (). The form or was the main form of the name, and initially coexisted with the form until the late 4th to early 3rd centuries BC, when / became the only variant of the name in use.

This name meant &quot;armed with throwing darts and arrows&quot; and is cognate with the Indic Sanskrit term (), which makes it semantically similar to the endonym of the Scythians, , meaning &quot;archers.&quot;

The later, Middle Iranic, form of was or , of which the later form, or , was recorded in ancient Greek as (; ).

== Location ==
The territory inhabited by the Sarmatians, which was known as Sarmatia () to Greco-Roman ethnographers, covered the western part of greater Scythia, and corresponded to today&#x27;s Central Ukraine, South-Eastern Ukraine, Southern Russia, Russian Volga, and South-Ural regions, and to a smaller extent the northeastern Balkans and around Moldova.

== History ==
===Origin===


The ethnogenesis of the Sarmatians occurred during the 6th to 4rd centuries BC, when nomads from Central Asia migrated into the territory of the Sauromatians in the southern Ural Mountains. These nomads conquered the Sauromatians, resulting in an increased incidence of eastern Asiatic features in the Early Sarmatians, similar to those of the Sakas. 

The name &quot;Sarmatians&quot; eventually came to be applied to the whole of the new people formed out of these migrations, whose constituent tribes were the Aorsi, Roxolani, Alans, and the Iazyges. Despite the similarity between the names Sarmatian and Sauromatian, modern authors distinguish between the two, since Sarmatian culture did not directly develop from the Sauromatian culture and the core of the Sarmatian culture was composed of these newly arrived migrants. A typical transitional site between these two periods is found in the Filippovka kurgans, which are Late Sauromatian-Early Sarmatian, and dated to the 5th-4th century BC.

===In the Pontic Steppe and Europe===

During the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, the centre of Sarmatian power remained north of the Caucasus and in the 3rd century BC the most important centres were around the lower Don, Kalmykia, the Kuban area, and the Central Caucasus.

During the end of the 4th century BC, the Scythians, the then dominant power in the Black Sea Steppe, were militarily defeated by the Macedonian kings Philip II of Macedon and Lysimachus in 339 and 313 BC respectively. They experienced another military setback after participating in the Bosporan Civil War in 309 BC and came under pressure from the Thracian Getae and the Celtic Bastarnae. At the same time, in Central Asia, following the Macedonian conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, the new Seleucid Empire started attacking the Sakā and Dahā nomads who lived to the north of its borders, who in turn put westward pressure on the Sarmatians. Pressured by the Sakā and Dahā in the east and taking advantage of the decline of Scythian power, the Sarmatians began crossing the Don river and invaded Scythia and also migrated south into the North Caucasus.

The first wave of westward Sarmatian migration happened during the 2nd century BC, and involved the Royal Sarmatians, or Saioi (from Scytho-Sarmatian , meaning &quot;kings&quot;), who moved into the Pontic Steppe, and the Iazyges, also called the Iaxamatai or Iazamatai, who initially settled between the Don and Dnieper rivers. The Roxolani, who might have been a mixed Scytho-Sarmatian tribe, followed the Iazyges and occupied the Black Sea steppes up to the Dnipro and raided the Crimean region during that century, at the end of which they were involved in a conflict with the generals of the Pontic king Mithridates VI Eupator in the Bosporan Chersonesus, while the Iazyges became his allies.

That the tribes formerly referred to by Herodotus as Scythians were now called Sarmatians by Hellenistic and Roman authors implies that the Sarmatian conquest did not involve a displacement of the Scythians from the Pontic Steppe, but rather that the Scythian tribes were absorbed by the Sarmatians. After their conquest of Scythia, the Sarmatians became the dominant political power in the northern Pontic Steppe, where Sarmatian graves first started appearing in the 2nd century BC. Meanwhile, the populations which still identified as Scythians proper became reduced to Crimea and the Dobruja region, and at one point the Crimean Scythians were the vassals of the Sarmatian queen Amage. Sarmatian power in the Pontic Steppes was also directed against the Greek cities on its shores, with the city of Pontic Olbia being forced to pay repeated tribute to the Royal Sarmatians and their king Saitapharnes, who is mentioned in the Protogenes inscription along with the tribes of the Thisamatae, Scythians, and Saudaratae. Another Sarmatian king, Gatalos, was named in a peace treaty concluded by the king Pharnaces I of Pontus with his enemies.

Two other Sarmatian tribes, the Siraces, who had previously originated in the Transcaspian Plains immediately to the northeast of Hyrcania before migrating to the west, and the Aorsi, moved to the west across the Volga and into the Caucasus mountains&#x27; foothills between the 2nd to 1st centuries BC. From there, the pressure from their growing power forcing the more western Sarmatian tribes to migrate further west, and the Aorsi and Siraces destroyed the power of the Royal Sarmatians and the Iazyges, with the Aorsi being able to extend their rule over a large region stretching from the Caucasus across the Terek–Kuma Lowland and Kalmykia in the west up to the Aral Sea region in the east. Yet another new Sarmatian group, the Alans, originated in Central Asia out of the merger of some old tribal groups with the Massagetae. Related to the Asii who invaded Bactria in the 2nd century BC, the Alans were pushed west by the Kangju people (known to Graeco-Roman authors as the in Greek, and the in Latin) who were living in the Syr Darya basin, from where they expanded their rule from Fergana to the Aral Sea region.
The hegemony of the Sarmatians in the Pontic Steppe continued during the 1st century BC, when they were allied with the Scythians against Diophantus, a general of Mithradates VI Eupator, before allying with Mithradates against the Romans and fighting for him in both Europe and Asia, demonstrating the Sarmatians&#x27; complete involvement in the affairs of the Pontic and Danubian regions. During the early part of the century, the Alans had migrated to the area to the northeast of the Lake Maeotis. Meanwhile, the Iazyges moved westwards until they reached the Danube, and the Roxolani moved into the area between the Dnipro and the Danube and from there further west. These two peoples attacked the regions around Tomis and Moesia, respectively. During this period, the Iazyges and Roxolani also attacked the Roman province of Thracia, whose governor Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus had to defend the Roman border of the Danube. During the 1st century BC, various Sarmatians reached the Pannonian Basin, with the Iazyges passing through the territories corresponding to modern-day Moldavia and Wallachia before settling in the Tisza valley, by the middle of the century.

Although the Sarmatian movements stopped temporarily during the 1st century BC due to the rise of the Dacian kingdom of Burebista, they resumed after the collapse of his kingdom following his assassination and in 16 BC. Lucius Tarius Rufus had to repel a Sarmatian attack on Thracia and Macedonia, while further attacks around 10 BC and 2 BC were defeated by Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus.
Meanwhile, other Sarmatian tribes, possibly the Aorsi, sent ambassadors to the Roman emperor Augustus, who tried to establish a diplomatic accommodation with them. During the 1st century AD, the Siraces and Aorsi, who were mutually hostile, participated in the Roman–Bosporan War on opposite sides: the Siraces and their king Zorsines allied with Mithridates III against his half-brother Cotys I, who was allied with Rome and the Aorsi. With the defeat of Mithridates, the Siraces were also routed and lost rulership over most of their lands. Between 50 and 60 CE, the Alans had appeared in the foothills of the Caucasus, from where they attacked the Caucasus and Transcaucasus areas and the Parthian Empire. During the 1st century AD, the Alans expanded across the Volga to the west, absorbing part of the Aorsi and displacing the rest, and pressure from the Alans forced the Iazyges and Roxolani to continue attacking the Roman Empire from across the Danube. During the 1st century AD, two Sarmatian rulers from the steppe named Pharzoios and Inismeōs were minting coins in Pontic Olbia.
The Roxolani continued their westward migration following the conflict on the Bosporan Chersonesus, and by 69 AD they were close enough to the lower Danube that they were able to attack across the river when it was frozen in winter, and soon later they and the Alans were living on the coast of the Black Sea, and they later moved further west and were living in the areas corresponding to modern-day Moldavia and western Ukraine.

The Sarmatian tribe of the Arraei, who had had close contacts with the Romans, eventually settled to the south of the Danube river, in Thrace, and another Sarmatian tribe, the Koralloi, were also living in the same area alongside a section of the Scythian Sindi.

During the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, the Iazyges often bothered the Roman authorities in Pannonia; they participated in the destruction of the Quadian kingdom of Vannius, and often migrated to the east across the Transylvanian Plateau and the Carpathian Mountains during seasonal movements or for trade.

By the 2nd century AD, the Alans had conquered the steppes of the north Caucasus and of the north Black Sea area and created a powerful confederation of tribes under their rule. Under the hegemony of the Alans a trade route connected the Pontic Steppe, the southern Urals, and the region presently known as Western Turkestan. One group of the Alans, the Antae, migrated north into the territory of what is presently Poland.
=== Decline ===

The hegemony of the Sarmatians in the steppes began to decline over the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, when the Huns conquered Sarmatian territory in the Caspian Steppe and the Ural region. The supremacy of the Sarmatians was finally destroyed when the Germanic Goths migrating from the Baltic Sea region conquered the Pontic Steppe around 200 AD. In 375 AD, the Huns conquered most of the Alans living to the east of the Don river, massacred a significant number of them, and absorbed them into their tribal polity, while the Alans to the west of the Don remained free from Hunnish domination. As part of the Hunnic state, the Alans participated in the Huns&#x27; defeat and conquest of the kingdom of the Ostrogoths on the Pontic Steppe. Some free Alans fled into the mountains of the Caucasus, where they participated in the ethnogenesis of populations including the Ossetians and the Kabardians, and other Alan groupings survived in Crimea. Others migrated into Central and then Western Europe, from where some of them went to Britannia and Hispania, and some joined the Germanic Vandals into crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and creating the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa.

The Sarmatians in the Bosporan Kingdom assimilated into the Greek civilization. Others assimilated with the proto-Circassian Meot people, and may have influenced the Circassian language. Some Sarmatians were absorbed by the Alans and Goths. During the Early Middle Ages, the Proto-Slavic population of Eastern Europe assimilated and absorbed Sarmatians during the political upheavals of that era. However, a people related to the Sarmatians, known as the Alans, survived in the North Caucasus into the Early Middle Ages, ultimately giving rise to the modern Ossetic ethnic group.

==Archaeology==
In 1947, Soviet archaeologist Boris Grakov defined a culture flourishing from the 6th century BC to the 4th century AD, apparent in late kurgan graves (buried within earthwork mounds), sometimes reusing part of much older kurgans. It was a nomadic steppe culture ranging from the Black Sea eastward to beyond the Volga that is especially evident at two of the major sites at Kardaielova and Chernaya in the trans-Uralic steppe. The four phases – distinguished by grave construction, burial customs, grave goods, and geographical spread – are:

#Sauromatian, 6th–5th centuries BC, also called the &quot;Blumenfeld culture&quot;
#Early Sarmatian, 4th–2nd centuries BC, also called the &quot;Prokhorovka culture&quot;
#Middle Sarmatian, late 2nd century BC to late 2nd century AD, also called the &quot;Suslov culture&quot;
#Late Sarmatian, late 2nd century AD to 4th century AD, also called the &quot;Shipov culture&quot;

While &quot;Sarmatian&quot; and &quot;Sauromatian&quot; are synonymous as ethnonyms, by convention they are given different meanings as archaeological technical terms. The term &quot;Prokhorovka culture&quot; derives from a complex of mounds in the Prokhorovski District, Orenburg region, excavated by S. I. Rudenko in 1916.

Reportedly, during 2001 and 2006 a great Late Sarmatian pottery centre was unearthed near Budapest, Hungary in the Üllő5 archaeological site. Typical grey, granular Üllő5 ceramics form a distinct group of Sarmatian pottery is found ubiquitously in the north-central part of the Great Hungarian Plain region, indicating a lively trading activity.

A 1998 paper on the study of glass beads found in Sarmatian graves suggests wide cultural and trade links.

A 2023 paper on a grave discovered in Cambridgeshire, England found via archaeogenetics that the person had Sarmatian-related ancestry, and was not related to the local population. Stable isotope analysis of his teeth determined that he had probably migrated long distances twice in his life. One tooth was radiocarbon dated to cal 126-228 CE.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Scythian-Sarmatian cultures may have given rise to the Greek legends of Amazons. Graves of armed women have been found in southern Ukraine and Russia. David Anthony noted that approximately 20% of Scythian-Sarmatian &quot;warrior graves&quot; on the lower Don and lower Volga contained women dressed for battle as warriors and he asserts that encountering that cultural phenomenon &quot;probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.&quot;

==Ethnology==

The Sarmatians were part of the Iranian steppe peoples, among whom were also Scythians and Saka. These also are grouped together as &quot;East Iranians.&quot; Archaeology has established the connection &#x27;between the Iranian-speaking Scythians, Sarmatians, and Saka and the earlier Timber-grave and Andronovo cultures&#x27;. Based on building construction, these three peoples were the likely descendants of those earlier archaeological cultures. The Sarmatians and Saka used the same stone construction methods as the earlier Andronovo culture. The Timber grave (Srubnaya culture) and Andronovo house building traditions were further developed by these three peoples. Andronovo pottery was continued by the Saka and Sarmatians. Archaeologists describe the Andronovo culture people as exhibiting pronounced Caucasoid features.

The first Sarmatians are mostly identified with the Prokhorovka culture, which moved from the southern Urals to the Lower Volga and then to the northern Pontic steppe, in the fourth–third centuries BC. During the migration, the Sarmatian population seems to have grown and they divided themselves into several groups, such as the Alans, Aorsi, Roxolani, and Iazyges. By 200 BC, the Sarmatians replaced the Scythians as the dominant people of the steppes. The Sarmatians and Scythians had fought on the Pontic steppe to the north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians, described as a large confederation, were to dominate these territories over the next five centuries. According to Brzezinski and Mielczarek, the Sarmatians were formed between the Don River and the Ural Mountains. Pliny the Elder wrote that they ranged from the Vistula River (in present-day Poland) to the Danube.

==Culture==
===Language===

The Sarmatians spoke an Iranian language that was derived from &#x27;Old Iranian&#x27; and was heterogenous. By the first century AD, the Iranian tribes in what is today South Russia spoke different languages or dialects, clearly distinguishable. According to a group of Iranologists writing in 1968, the numerous Iranian personal names in Greek inscriptions from the Black Sea coast indicate that the Sarmatians spoke a North-Eastern Iranian dialect ancestral to Alanian-Ossetian. However, Harmatta (1970) argued that &quot;the language of the Sarmatians or that of the Alans as a whole cannot be simply regarded as being Old Ossetian.&quot;

===Equipment===
The Roxolani, who were one of the earlier Sarmatian tribes to have migrated into Europe and therefore were among the more geographically western Sarmatians, used helmets and corselets made of raw ox hide, and wicker shields, as well as spears, bows, and swords. The Roxolani adopted these forms of armour and weaponry from the Germanic Bastarnae near whom they lived. The more eastern Sarmatian tribes used scale armour and used a long lance called the  and bows in battle.

=== Metalwork ===
The early Sarmatians already possessed the technique of decorating with gold inclusions, observed in Achaemenid metalwork. It was spread by nomads in the Eurasian steppes during the 7th-5th century BC, from the Altai Mountains (Arzhan-2 kurgan) westward to central Kazakhstan and the southern Urals. Peter the Great particularly cherished his Demidov Gift, a Sarmatian gold collection, now exhibited in the Gold Chamber at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. The Novocherkassk Treasure with the famous Sarmatian Diadem adorned with the Tree of Life can also be seen in the Hermitage Gold Room. It is a Sarmatian hoard of gold, silver and bronze articles and jewellery discovered in the Khokhlach barrow in Novocherkassk in 1864. Chronologically it belongs to the first and second centuries AD.

Numerous weapons, armour, helmets were already found in the excavations of the Early Sarmatian Filippovka kurgan (c. 450-300 BCE):

Many Chinese mirrors can be found in graves of the Middle-Sarmatian to Late-Sarmatian periods. 

==Genetics==
=== Autosomal DNA ===
Sarmatians emerged primarily from the Bronze and Iron Age Western Steppe Herders (Steppe_MLBA), associated with the Sintashta, Srubnaya and Andronovo cultures, but also carried a small amount of admixed from an East Asian-derived population represented by Khövsgöl LBA groups, which may have been indirectly mediated via contact with the related Saka from the Altai region, which are regarded as the oldest Scythoid cultural group. The Sarmatians also received geneflow from an ancient Iranian population associated with the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex.

A genetic study published in &quot;Current Biology&quot; in 2022 regarding the genetic origin of Huns, Avars, and conquering Hungarians. 265 ancient genomes were analyzed, it revealed that the Hungarian conquerors admixed with Sarmatians and Huns. Sarmatian ancestry was also detected among several Hun samples which implies a significant Sarmatian influence on European Huns.

There is also evidence for a later eastwards expansion of Sarmatian-like ancestry, evident in a Saka-associated sample from southeastern Kazakhstan (Konyr Tobe 300CE), displaying around 85% Sarmatian and 15% additional BMAC-like ancestry. Sarmatian-like contributions have also been detected among some Xiongnu remains.

=== Haplogroups ===
Afanasiev et al. (2014) analyzed ten Alanic burials on the Don River. Four of them carried Y-DNA Haplogroup G2 and six of them possessed mtDNA haplogroup I.

In 2015, again Afanasiev et al. analyzed skeletons of various Sarmato-Alan and Saltovo-Mayaki culture Kurgan burials. The two Alan samples from the fourth to sixth century AD belonged to Y-DNA haplogroups G2a-P15 and R1a-Z94, while two of the three Sarmatian samples from the second to third century AD found to belong to Y-DNA haplogroup J1-M267, and one belonged to R1a. Three Saltovo-Mayaki samples from the eighth to ninth century AD turned out to have Y-DNA corresponding to haplogroups G, J2a-M410 and R1a-z94.

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; in March 2017 examined several Sarmatian individuals buried in Pokrovka, Russia (southwest of the Ural Mountains) between the fifth century BC and the second century BC. The sample of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1b1a2a2. This was the dominant lineage among males of the earlier Yamnaya culture. The eleven samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to the haplogroups U3, M, U1a&#x27;c, T, F1b, N1a1a1a1a, T2, U2e2, H2a1f, T1a, and U5a1d2b. The Sarmatians examined were found to be closely related to peoples of the earlier Yamnaya culture and to the Poltavka culture.

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of twelve Sarmatians buried between 400 BC and 400 AD. The five samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1a1, I2b, R (two samples), and R1. The eleven samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to C4a1a, U4a2 (two samples), C4b1, I1, A, U2e1h (two samples), U4b1a4, H28, and U5a1.

A genetic study published in &quot;Science Advances&quot; in October 2018 examined the remains of five Sarmatians buried between 55 AD and 320 AD. The three samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1a1a and R1b1a2a2 (two samples), while the five samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup H2a1, T1a1, U5b2b (two samples), and D4q.

A genetic study published in &quot;Current Biology&quot; in July 2019 examined the remains of nine Sarmatians from the southern Ural Mountains between 7th–2nd century BC. The five samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup Q1c-L332, R1a1e-CTS1123, R1a-Z645 (two samples), and E1b1b-PF6746, while the nine samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup W, W3a, T1a1, U5a2, U5b2a1a2, T1a1d, C1e, U5b2a1a1, U5b2c, and U5b2c.

A archaeogenetic study published in &quot;Cell&quot; in 2022, analyzed 17 Late Sarmatian samples from 4-5th century AD from the Pannonian Basin in Hungary. The nine extraced Y-DNA belonged to a diverse set of haplogroups, 2x I2a1b1a2b1-CTS4348, 2x I1a2a1a1a-Z141, I1a-DF29, G2a1-FGC725, E1b1b-L142.1, R1a1a1b2a2a1-Z2123 and R1b1a1b1a1a2b-PF6570, while the mtDNA haplogroups C5, H, 2x H1, H5, H7, H40, H59, HV0 I1, J1, 2x K1a, T1a, 2x T2b, U2.

==Physical appearance==

The Early Sarmatians from the Filippovka kurgans (4th century BC) combined Western (Timber Grave and Andronovo) and Eastern characteristics. Compared with classical Sauromatians, Early Sarmatians, such as those of Filippovka, generally display an increased incidence of eastern Asiatic features. They most closely resembled the Saka populations of Central Asia, particularly from the Altai region (Pazyryk), and were very different from the western Scythians, or the Sarmatians of the Volga River area. 

The Roman author Ovid recorded that one of the Sarmatian tribes, the Coralli, had blond hair, which is a characteristic that Ammianus Marcellinus also ascribed to the Alans. He wrote that nearly all of the Alani were &quot;of great stature and beauty, their hair is somewhat yellow, their eyes are frighteningly fierce.&quot;

Modern historians have offered conflicting opinions about the description of the Alans as being tall and having blond hair. For instance, Roger Batty has posited that &quot;presumably, only some of the Alans would have been blond&quot;. Bernard Bachrach has likewise suggested that because the Alans assimilated so many foreigners, the majority of them are unlikely to have been blond-haired, and that there was no distinguishing physical characteristic of the Alans. However, John Day has argued that Bachrach&#x27;s analysis is flawed, because he mistranslated the original passage from Ammianus Marcellinus, and that the majority of the Alans were in fact blond. Iver Neumann has suggested that the description of Alans as blond may mean that their Indo-Iranian ancestry was greater than it was in the Huns. Charles Previté-Orton wrote that the Alans were only partly of Iranian heritage, and that the other part of their ancestry came from captive women and slaves.

==Sarmatism==
Sarmatism (or Sarmatianism) is an ethno-cultural concept with a shade of politics designating the formation of an idea of the origin of Poland from Sarmatians within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was the dominant Baroque culture and ideology of the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) that existed in times of the Renaissance to the eighteenth centuries. Together with another concept of &quot;Golden Liberty,&quot; it formed a central aspect of the Commonwealth&#x27;s culture and society. At its core was the unifying belief that the people of the Polish Commonwealth descended from the ancient Iranic Sarmatians, the legendary invaders of Slavic lands in antiquity.

<text>A is a Japanese concealed weapon used by samurai or ninja or in martial arts as a hidden dagger or &quot;metsubushi&quot; to distract or misdirect.

Shuriken are also known as throwing stars, or ninja stars, although they were originally constructed in many different shapes. The major varieties of shuriken are the and the or .

Shuriken functioned as supplementary weapons to the sword or to other weapons in a samurai&#x27;s arsenal, although they often had an important tactical effect in battle. The art of wielding the shuriken is known as shurikenjutsu and was taught as a minor part of the martial-arts curriculum of many famous schools, such as Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, Ittō-ryū, Kukishin-ryū, and Togakure-ryū.

==Bo-shuriken==
A &quot;bo-shuriken&quot; is a throwing weapon consisting of a straight iron or steel spike, usually four-sided but sometimes round or octagonal in section. Some examples have points on both ends. The length ranges from 12 to 21 cm (5–8.5 in) and the average weight from 35 to 150 grams (1.2–5.4 ounces). They should not be confused with the kunai, which is a thrusting and stabbing implement that is sometimes thrown.

&quot;Bo-shuriken&quot; were constructed from a wide variety of everyday items, and as such came in many shapes and sizes. Some derived their names from the materials of which they were made, such as &quot;kugi-gata&quot; (nail form), &quot;hari-gata&quot; (needle form) and &quot;tantō-gata&quot; (knife form); some were named after an object of similar appearance, such as &quot;hoko-gata&quot; (spear form), &quot;matsuba-gata&quot; (pine-needle form); while others have names that are purely descriptive, such as &quot;kankyuto&quot; (piercing tool form), &quot;kunai-gata&quot; (utility tool form), or &quot;teppan&quot; (plate metal) and &quot;biao&quot; (pin).

The &quot;bo-shuriken&quot; is thrown in a number of ways, such as overhead, underarm, sideways and rearwards, but in each case the throw involves the blade sliding out of the hand through the fingers in a smooth, controlled flight. The major throwing methods are the &quot;jiki da-ho&quot; (direct-hit method), and the &quot;han-ten da-ho&quot; (turning-hit method). These two are technically different, in that the former does not allow the blade to spin before it hits the target, while the latter requires that the blade spin&quot;.&quot;
Other items such as hairpins, &quot;kogata&quot; (utility knife), and chopsticks were thrown in the same way as &quot;bo-shuriken&quot;, although they were not associated with any particular school of shurikenjutsu.

The origins of the &quot;bo-shuriken&quot; in Japan are still unclear, despite continuing research. This is partly because shurikenjutsu was a secret art and also due to the fact that throughout early Japanese history there were many independent exponents of the skill of throwing long, thin objects. The earliest-known reference to a school teaching shurikenjutsu is Ganritsu Ryu, active during the 17th century. This school utilized a long, thin implement with a bulbous head, thought to be derived from the arrow. Surviving examples of blades used by this school appear to combine an arrow&#x27;s shape with that of a needle traditionally used in Japanese leatherwork and armor manufacture.

There are earlier mentions in written records, such as the , of the standard knife and short sword being thrown in battle. Miyamoto Musashi is said to have won a duel by throwing his short sword at his opponent, killing him.

==Hira shuriken/shaken==
&quot;Hira-shuriken&quot; generally resemble the popular conception of shuriken. They are constructed from thin, flat plates of metal derived from a variety of sources including &quot;hishi-gane&quot; (coins), &quot;kugi-nuki&quot; (carpentry tools), spools, and &quot;senban&quot; (nail removers).

They often have a hole in the center and possess a fairly thin blade sharpened mainly at the tip. The holes derive from their source in items that had holes—old coins, washers, and nail-removing tools. This proved convenient for the shuriken user as the weapons could be strung on a string or dowel in the belt for transport, and the hole also had aerodynamic and weighting effects that aided the flight of the blade.

There are a wide variety of forms of &quot;hira-shuriken,&quot; and they are now usually identified by the number of points the blades possess. As with &quot;bo-shuriken&quot;, the various shapes of &quot;hira-shuriken&quot; were usually representative of a particular school (&quot;ryū&quot;) or region that preferred the use of such shapes, and it is therefore possible to identify the school by the type of blade used.

==Usage==
Shuriken targets were primarily the more exposed parts of the body: the eyes, face, hands, or feet. Shuriken, despite low mass, were capable of dealing lethal blows at short ranges. In some cases, shuriken were capable of partially disemboweling targets.

Shuriken, especially &quot;hira-shuriken&quot;, were also used in novel ways—they could be embedded in the ground, injuring those who stepped on them (similar to a caltrop), wrapped in a fuse to be ignited and thrown to cause fire, or wrapped in a cloth soaked in poison and lit to cover an area with a cloud of poisonous smoke. They could also be used as a handheld weapon in close combat.

There are reports of shuriken being coated with poison, intended either as a throwing weapon or to be left in a conspicuous place for a victim to pick up. Other reports indicate that shuriken may have been buried in dirt or animal feces and allowed to harbor the bacterium &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;—if the point penetrated a victim deeply enough, the bacteria transferred into the wound could cause a then-incurable tetanus infection.

Shuriken are simple weapons, but their historical value has increased. Unlike the &quot;katana&quot; and other bladed weapons, antique shuriken are not often well preserved (although some are blackened in ash to prevent corrosion), largely due to their expendable nature.

==Legality==
Modern commercially available shuriken, which are sold in Europe and North America, are often made of stainless steel. However, in many countries and jurisdictions, they are illegal to possess or carry, such as in Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom (manufacture, sale, distribution and import). In the United States, they are prohibited in some states, such as California and New York. In some cases they may be allowed, but may still be subject to specific local legislation. Owners may be required to possess a certificate for possession.

<doc id="140469" wikidata="Q837791" url="?curid=140469" title="Iazyges">
<text>The Iazyges () were an ancient Sarmatian tribe that traveled westward in 200BC from Central Asia to the steppes of modern Ukraine. In , they moved into modern-day Hungary and Serbia near the Dacian steppe between the Danube and Tisza rivers, where they adopted a semi-sedentary lifestyle.

In their early relationship with Rome, the Iazyges were used as a buffer state between the Romans and the Dacians; this relationship later developed into one of overlord and client state, with the Iazyges being nominally sovereign subjects of Rome. Throughout this relationship, the Iazyges carried out raids on Roman land, which often caused punitive expeditions to be made against them.

Almost all of the major events of the Iazyges, such as the two Dacian Wars—in both of which the Iazyges fought, assisting Rome in subjugating the Dacians in the first war and conquering them in the second—are connected with war. Another such war is the Marcomannic War that occurred between 169 and 175, in which this time, Iazyges fought against Rome but were defeated by Marcus Aurelius and had severe penalties imposed on them.

==Culture==
Although the Iazyges were nomads before their migration to the Tisza plain, they became semi-sedentary once there, and lived in towns, although they migrated between these towns to allow their cattle to graze. Their language was a dialect of Old Iranian, which was quite different from most of the other Sarmatian dialects of Old Iranian. According to the Roman writer Gaius Valerius Flaccus, when an Iazyx became too old to fight in battle, they were killed by their sons or, according to Roman geographer Pomponius Mela, threw themselves from a rock.

===Etymology===
The Iazyges&#x27; name was Latinized as &#x27; () or &#x27;, or sometimes as &#x27;. Their name was also occasionally spelled as &quot;Iazuges&quot;. Several corruptions of their name, such as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;, existed. Other modern English forms of their name are &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;. The root of the name may be Proto-Iranian &quot;*yaz-&quot;, &quot;to sacrifice&quot;, perhaps indicating a caste or tribe specializing in religious sacrifices.
According to , a 19th-century French classical scholar, the Iazyges Metanastæ, a warlike Sarmatian race, which had migrated during the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius, and therefore received the name of &quot;Metanastæ&quot;, resided in the mountains west of the Theiss (Tisza) and east of the Gran (Hron) and Danube. The Greek Metanastæ () means &quot;migrants&quot;. The united Scythians and Sarmatæ called themselves Iazyges, which Laurent connected with Old Church Slavonic (&quot;językŭ&quot;, &quot;tongue, language, people&quot;).

===Burial traditions===
The graves made by the Iazyges were often rectangular or circular, although some were ovoid, hexagonal, or even octagonal. They were flat and were grouped like burials in modern cemeteries. Most of the graves&#x27; access openings face south, southeast, or southwest. The access openings are between and wide. The graves themselves are between and in diameter.

After their migration to the Tisza plain, the Iazyges were in serious poverty. This is reflected in the poor furnishings found at burial sites, which are often filled with clay vessels, beads, and sometimes brooches. Iron daggers and swords were very rarely found in the burial site. Their brooches and arm-rings were of the La Tène type, showing the Dacians had a distinct influence on the Iazyges. Later tombs showed an increase in material wealth; tombs of the 2nd to early 4th centuries had weapons in them 86% of the time and armor in them 5% of the time. Iazygian tombs along the Roman border show a strong Roman influence.

===Diet===
Before their migration into the Pannonian Basin, while still living north of Tyras, on the north-western coast of the Black Sea, the geographer Strabo states that their diet consisted largely of &quot;honey, milk, and cheese&quot;. After their migration, the Iazyges were cattle breeders; they required salt to preserve their meat but there were no salt mines within their territory. According to Cassius Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.

The Iazyges used hanging, asymmetrical, barrel-shaped pots that had uneven weight distribution. The rope used to hang the pot was wrapped around the edges of the side collar; it is believed the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing it to spin in circles. Due to the spinning motion, there are several theories about the pot&#x27;s uses. It is believed the small hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol using the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (&quot;Impatiens noli-tangere&quot;), and larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese.

===Military===
The Iazyges wore heavy armor, such as sugarloaf helms, and scale armor made of iron, bronze, horn, or horse hoof, which was sewn onto a leather gown so the scales would partially overlap. They used long, two-handed lances called ; they wielded these from horses, which they barded. Their military was exclusively cavalry. They are believed to have used saddle blankets on their horses. Although it was originally Gaulish, it is believed the Iazyges used the , a trumpet-like wind instrument.

===Religion===
One of the Iazygian towns, Bormanon, is believed to have had hot springs because settlement names starting with &quot;Borm&quot; were commonly used among European tribes to denote that the location had hot springs, which held religious importance for many Celtic tribes. It is not known, however, whether the religious significance of the hot springs was passed on to the Iazyges with the concept itself. The Iazyges used horse-tails in their religious rituals.

==Economy==
When the Iazyges migrated to the plain between the Tisza and the Danube, their economy suffered severely. Many explanations have been offered for this, such as their trade with the Pontic Steppe and Black Sea being cut off and the absence of any mineable resources within their territory making their ability to trade negligible. Additionally, Rome proved more difficult to raid than the Iazyges&#x27; previous neighbors, largely due to Rome&#x27;s well-organized army. The Iazyges had no large-scale organized production of goods for most of their history. As such, most of their trade goods were gained via small-scale raids upon neighboring peoples, although they did have some incidental horticulture. Several pottery workshops have been found in Banat, which was within the territory of the Iazyges, close to their border with Rome. These pottery workshops were built from the late 3rd century and have been found at Vršac–Crvenka, Grădinari–Selişte, Timişoara–Freidorf, Timişoara–Dragaşina, Hodoni, Pančevo, Dolovo, and Izvin şi Jabuca.

The Iazyges&#x27; trade with the Pontic Steppe and Black Sea was extremely important to their economy; after the Marcomannic War, Marcus Aurelius offered them the concession of movement through Dacia to trade with the Roxolani, which reconnected them with the Pontic Steppe trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani&#x27;s and the Iazyges&#x27; trade with the Pontic Steppe. The Iazyges also traded with the Romans, although this trade was smaller in scale. While there are Roman bronze coins scattered along the entirety of the Roman Danubian Limes, the highest concentration of them appear in the Iazyges&#x27; territory.

===Imports===
Because the Iazyges had no organized production for most of their history, imported pottery finds are sparse. Some goods, such as bronze or silver vessels, amphorae, terracotta wares, and lamps are extremely rare or nonexistent. Some amphorae and lamps have been found in Iazygian territory, often near major river crossings near the border with Rome, but the location of the sites make it impossible to determine whether these goods are part of an Iazygain site, settlement, or cemetery; or merely the lost possessions of Roman soldiers stationed in or near the locations.

The most commonly found imported ware was &quot;Terra sigillata&quot;. At Iazygian cemeteries, a single complete &quot;terra sigillata&quot; vessel and a large number of fragments have been found in Banat. &quot;Terra sigillata&quot; finds in Iazygian settlements are confusing in some cases; it can sometimes be impossible to determine the timeframe of the wares in relation to its area and thus impossible to determine whether the wares came to rest there during Roman times or after the Iazyges took control. Finds of &quot;terra sigillata&quot; of an uncertain age have been found in Deta, Kovačica–Čapaš, Kuvin, Banatska Palanka, Pančevo, Vršac, Zrenjanin–Batka, Dolovo, Delibata, Perlez, Aradac, Botoš, and Bočar. Finds of &quot;terra sigillata&quot; that have been confirmed to having been made the time of Iazygian possession but of uncertain date have been found in Timișoara–Cioreni, Hodoni, Iecea Mică, Timișoara–Freidorf, Satchinez, Criciova, Becicherecul Mic, and Foeni–Seliște. The only finds of &quot;terra sigillata&quot; whose time of origin is certain have been found in Timișoara–Freidorf, dated to the 3rd century AD. Amphorae fragments have been found in Timișoara–Cioreni, Iecea Mică, Timișoara–Freidorf, Satchinez, and Biled; all of these are confirmed to be of Iazygian origin but none of them have definite chronologies.

In Tibiscum, an important Roman and later Iazygian settlement, only a very low percent of pottery imports were imported during or after the 3rd century. The pottery imports consisted of &quot;terra sigillata&quot;, amphorae, glazed pottery, and stamped white pottery. Only 7% of imported pottery was from the &quot;late period&quot; during or after the 3rd century, while the other 93% of finds were from the &quot;early period&quot;, the 2nd century or earlier. Glazed pottery was almost nonexistent in Tibiscum; the only finds from the early period are a few fragments with Barbotine decorations and stamped with &quot;CRISPIN(us)&quot;. The only finds from the late period are a handful of glazed bowl fragments that bore relief decorations on both the inside and the outside. The most common type of amphorae is the Dressel 24 similis; finds are from the time of rule of Hadrian to the late period. An amphora of type Carthage LRA 4 dated between the 3rd and 4th century AD has been found in Tibiscum-Iaz and an amphora of type Opaiţ 2 has been found in Tibiscum-Jupa.

==Geography==
Records of eight Iazygian towns have been documented; these are Uscenum, Bormanum, Abieta, Trissum, Parca, Candanum, Pessium, and Partiscum. There was also a settlement on Gellért Hill. Their capital was at Partiscum, the site of which roughly corresponds with that of Kecskemét, a city in modern-day Hungary. It is believed that a Roman road may have traversed the Iazyges&#x27; territory for about , connecting Aquincum to Porolissum, and passing near the site of modern-day Albertirsa. This road then went on to connect with the Black Sea city states.

The area of plains between the Danube and Tisza rivers that was controlled by the Iazyges was similar in size to Italy and about long. The terrain was largely swampland dotted with a few small hills that was devoid of any mineable metals or minerals. This lack of resources and the problems the Romans would face trying to defend it may explain why the Romans never annexed it as a province but left it as a client-kingdom.

According to English cartographer Aaron Arrowsmith, the Iazyges Metanastæ lived east (sic) of the [Roman] Dacia separating it from [Roman] Pannonia and Germania. The Iazyges Metanastæ drove Dacians from Pannonia and Tibiscus River (today known as Timiș River).

==History==
===Early history===
In the 3rd century BC the Iazyges lived in modern-day south-eastern Ukraine along the northern shores of the Sea of Azov, which the Ancient Greeks and Romans called the Lake of Maeotis. From there, the Iazyges—or at least some of them—moved west along the shores of the Black Sea into modern-day Moldova and south-western Ukraine. It is possible the entirety of the Iazyges did not move west and that some of them stayed along the Sea of Azov, which would explain the occasional occurrence of the surname &quot;&quot;; the Iazyges that possibly remained along the Sea of Azov, however, are never mentioned again.

====Migration====

In the 2nd centuryBC, sometime before 179BC, the Iazyges began to migrate westward to the steppe near the Lower Dniester. This may have occurred because the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges&#x27; eastern neighbors, were also migrating westward due to pressure from the Aorsi, which put pressure on the Iazyges and forced them to migrate westward as well.

The views of modern scholars as to how and when the Iazyges entered the Pannonian plain are divided. The main source of division is over the issue of if the Romans approved, or even ordered, the Iazyges to migrate, with both sides being subdivided into groups debating the timing of such a migration. Andreas Alföldi states that the Iazyges could not have been present to the north-east and east of the Pannonian Danube unless they had Roman approval. This viewpoint is supported by János Harmatta, who claims that the Iazyges were settled with both the approval and support of the Romans, so as to act as a buffer state against the Dacians. András Mócsy suggests that Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Augur, who was Roman consul in 26BC, may have been responsible for the settlement of the Iazyges as a buffer between Pannonia and Dacia. However, Mócsy also suggests that the Iazyges may have arrived gradually, such that they initially were not noticed by the Romans. John Wilkes believes that the Iazyges reached the Pannonian plain either by the end of Augustus&#x27;s rule (14AD) or some time between 17 and 20AD. Constantin Daicoviciu suggests that the Iazyges entered the area around 20AD, after the Romans called upon them to be a buffer state. Coriolan Opreanu supports the theory of the Iazyges being invited, or ordered, to occupy the Pannonian plain, also around 20AD. Gheorghe Bichir and Ion Horațiu Crișan support the theory that the Iazyges first began to enter the Pannonian plain in large numbers under Tiberius, around 20AD. The most prominent scholars that state the Iazyges were not brought in by the Romans, or later approved, are Doina Benea, Mark Ščukin, and Jenő Fitz. Doina Benea states that the Iazyges slowly infiltrated the Pannonian plain sometime in the first half of the 1st centuryAD, without Roman involvement. Jenő Fitz promotes the theory that the Iazyges arrived &quot;en masse&quot; around 50AD, although a gradual infiltration preceded it. Mark Ščukin states only that the Iazyges arrived by themselves sometime around 50AD. Andrea Vaday argued against the theory of a Roman approved or ordered migration, citing the lack of strategic reasoning, as the Dacians were not actively providing a threat to Rome during the 20–50AD period.

The occupation of the lands between the Danube and Tisza by the Iazyges was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (77–79AD), in which he says that the Iazyges inhabited the basins and plains of the lands, while the forested and mountainous area largely retained a Dacian population, which was later pushed back to the Tisza by the Iazyges. Pliny&#x27;s statements are corroborated by the earlier accounts of Seneca the Younger in his &quot;Quaestiones Naturales&quot; (61–64AD), where he uses the Iazyges to discuss the borders that separate the various peoples.

From 78 to 76BC, the Romans led an expedition to an area north of the Danube—then the Iazyges&#x27; territory—because the Iazyges had allied with Mithridates VI of Pontus, with whom the Romans were at war. In 44BC King Burebista of Dacia died and his kingdom began to collapse. After this, the Iazyges began to take possession of the Pannonian Basin, the land between the Danube and Tisa rivers in modern-day south-central Hungary. Historians have posited this was done at the behest of the Romans, who sought to form a buffer state between their provinces and the Dacians to protect the Roman province of Pannonia. The Iazyges encountered the Basternae and Getae along their migration path sometime around 20AD and turned southward to follow the coast of the Black Sea until they settled in the Danube Delta. This move is attested by the large discrepancy in the location reported by Tacitus relative to that which was earlier given by Ovid. Archeological finds suggest that while the Iazyges took hold of the northern plain between the Danube and the Tisa by around 50AD, they did not take control of the land south of the Partiscum-Lugio line until the late 1st or early 2nd century.

The effects of this migration have been observed in the ruins of burial sites left behind by the Iazyges; the standard grave goods made of gold being buried alongside a person were absent, as was the equipment of a warrior; this may have been because the Iazyges were no longer in contact with the Pontic Steppe and were cut off from all trade with them, which had previously been a vital part of their economy. Another problem with the Iazyges&#x27; new location was that it lacked both precious minerals and metals, such as iron, which could be turned into weapons. They found it was much more difficult to raid the Romans, who had organized armies around the area, as opposed to the disorganized armies of their previous neighbors. The cutting-off of trade with the Pontic Steppe meant they could no longer trade for gold for burial sites, assuming any of them could afford it. The only such goods they could find were the pottery and metals of the adjacent Dacian and Celtic peoples. Iron weapons would have been exceedingly rare, if the Iazyges even had them, and would likely have been passed down from father to son rather than buried because they could not have been replaced.

====Post-migration====

After the conquest of the Pannonian Basin, the Iazyges appear to have ruled over some measure of the remaining Germanic, Celtic, and Dacian populations, with the hilly areas north of modern-day Budapest retaining strong Germanic traditions, with a significant presence of Germanic burial traditions. Items of Celtic manufacturing appear up until the late 2nd centuryAD, in the northern area of the Carpathian Basin.

During the time of Augustus, the Iazyges sent an embassy to Rome to request friendly relations. In a modern context, these &quot;friendly relations&quot; would be similar to a non-aggression pact. Around this time, some of the western parts of the land of the Iazyges were occupied, apparently without conflict, by the Quadi, which scholar Nicholas Higham states &quot;suggests long-term collaboration between [them]&quot;.

Later, during the reign of Tiberius, the Iazyges became one of many new client-tribes of Rome. Roman client states were treated according to the Roman tradition of patronage, exchanging rewards for service. The client king was called &quot;socius et amicus Romani Populi&quot; (ally and friend of the Roman People); the exact obligations and rewards of this relationship, however, are vague. Even after being made into a client state, the Iazyges conducted raids across their border with Rome, for example in 6AD and again in 16AD. In 20AD the Iazyges moved westward along the Carpathians into the Pannonian Steppe, and settled in the steppes between the Danube and the Tisza river, taking absolute control of the territory from the Dacians. In 50AD, an Iazyges cavalry detachment assisted King Vannius, a Roman client-king of the Quadi, in his fight against the Suevi.

In the Year of Four Emperors, 69AD, the Iazyges gave their support to Vespasian, who went on to become the sole emperor of Rome. The Iazyges also offered to guard the Roman border with the Dacians to free up troops for Vespasian&#x27;s invasion of Italy; Vespasian refused, however, fearing they would attempt a takeover or defect. Vespasian required the chiefs of the Iazyges to serve in his army so they could not organize an attack on the undefended area around the Danube. Vespasian enjoyed support from the majority of the Germanic and Dacian tribes.

Domitian&#x27;s campaign against Dacia was mostly unsuccessful; the Romans, however, won a minor skirmish that allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he paid the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian had been given the title of Imperator—for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting the populace—or at least the senate—was aware it had been a less-than-successful war, despite Domitian&#x27;s claims otherwise. In 89AD, however, Domitian invaded the Iazyges along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details of this war are known but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated, it is, however, known that Roman troops acted to repel simultaneous incursion by the Iazyges into Dacian lands.

In early 92AD the Iazyges, Roxolani, Dacians, and Suebi invaded the Roman province of Pannonia—modern-day Croatia, northern Serbia, and western Hungary. Emperor Domitian called upon the Quadi and the Marcomanni to supply troops to the war. Both client-tribes refused to supply troops so Rome declared war upon them as well. In May 92AD, the Iazyges annihilated the Roman Legio XXI Rapax in battle. Domitian, however, is said to have secured victory in this war by January of the next year. It is believed, based upon a rare Aureus coin showing an Iazyx with a Roman standard kneeling, with the caption of &quot;Signis a Sarmatis Resitvtis&quot;, that the standard is taken from the annihilated Legio XXI Rapax was returned to Rome at the end of the war. Although the accounts of the Roman-Iazyges wars of 89 and 92AD are both muddled, it has been shown they are separate wars and not a continuation of the same war. The threat presented by the Iazyges and neighbouring people to the Roman provinces was significant enough that Emperor Trajan travelled across the Mid and Lower Danube in late 98 to early 99, where he inspected existing fortification and initiated the construction of more forts and roads.

Tacitus, a Roman Historian, records in his book &quot;Germania&quot;, which was written in 98AD, that the Osi tribes paid tribute to both the Iazyges and the Quadi, although the exact date this relationship began is unknown.

During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges were trained in the Roman army, officially as an honor but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held absolute power over the Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops but these were denied because of the fear they might revolt or desert in a war.

===Dacian wars===
An alliance between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans to focus more on the Danube than the Rhine. This is shown by the placement of the Roman legions; during the time of Augustus&#x27;s rule there were eight legions stationed along the Rhine, four stationed in Mainz, and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus&#x27; rule, however, Roman military resources had become centered along the Danube rather than the Rhine, with nine legions stationed along the Danube and only one at the Rhine. By the time of Marcus Aurelius, however, twelve legions were stationed along the Danube. The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danube—from Germany to the Black Sea—and in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower Danube with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower Danube, respectively; they, however, had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.

====First Dacian War====
Trajan, with the assistance of the Iazyges, led his legions into Dacia against King Decebalus, in the year 101. In order to cross the Danube with such a large army, Apollodorus of Damascus, the Romans&#x27; chief architect, created a bridge through the Iron Gates by cantilevering it from the sheer face of the Iron Gates. From this he created a great bridge with sixty piers that spanned the Danube. Trajan used this to strike deep within Dacia, forcing the king, Decebalus, to surrender and become a client king.

====Second Dacian War====
As soon as Trajan returned to Rome, however, Decebalus began to lead raids into Roman territory and also attacked the Iazyges, who were still a client-tribe of Rome. Trajan concluded that he had made a mistake in allowing Decebalus to remain so powerful. In 106AD, Trajan again invaded Dacia, with 11 legions, and, again with the assistance of the Iazyges—who were the only barbarian tribe that aided the Romans in this war— and the only barbarian tribe in the Danube region which did not ally with Dacia. The Iazyges were the only tribe to aid Rome in both Dacian Wars, pushed rapidly into Dacia. Decebalus chose to commit suicide rather than be captured, knowing that he would be paraded in a triumph before being executed. In 113AD Trajan annexed Dacia as a new Roman province, the first Roman province to the east of the Danube. Trajan, however, did not incorporate the steppe between the Tisza river and the Transylvanian mountains into the province of Dacia but left it for the Iazyges. Back in Rome, Trajan was given a triumph lasting 123 days, with lavish gladiatorial games and chariot races. The wealth coming from the gold mines of Dacia funded these lavish public events and the construction of Trajan&#x27;s Column, which was designed and constructed by Apollodorus of Damascus; it was tall and had 23 spiral bands filled with 2,500 figures, giving a full depiction of the Dacian war. Ancient sources say 500,000 slaves were taken in the war but moderns sources believe it was probably closer to 100,000 slaves.

===After the Dacian Wars===

Ownership of the region of Oltenia became a source of dispute between the Iazyges and the Roman empire. The Iazyges had originally occupied the area before the Dacians seized it; it was taken during the Second Dacian War by Trajan, who was determined to constitute Dacia as a province. The land offered a more direct connection between Moesia and the new Roman lands in Dacia, which may be the reason Trajan was determined to keep it. The dispute led to war in 107–108, where the future emperor Hadrian, then governor of Pannonia Inferior, defeated them. The exact terms of the peace treaty are not known, but it is believed the Romans kept Oltenia in exchange for some form of concession, likely involving a one-time tribute payment. The Iazyges also took possession of Banat around this time, which may have been part of the treaty.

In 117, the Iazyges and the Roxolani invaded Lower Pannonia and Lower Moesia, respectively. The war was probably brought on by difficulties in visiting and trading with each other because Dacia lay between them. The Dacian provincial governor Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus was killed in the invasion. The Roxolani surrendered first, so it is likely the Romans exiled and then replaced their client king with one of their choosing. The Iazyges then concluded peace with Rome. The Iazyges and other Sarmatians invaded Roman Dacia in 123, likely for the same reason as the previous war; they were not allowed to visit and trade with each other. Marcius Turbo stationed 1,000 legionaries in the towns Potaissa and Porolissum, which the Romans probably used as the invasion point into Rivulus Dominarum. Marcius Turbo succeeded in defeating the Iazyges; the terms of the peace and the date, however, are not known.

===Marcomannic Wars===
In 169, the Iazyges, Quadi, Suebi, and Marcomanni once again invaded Roman territory. The Iazyges led an invasion into Alburnum in an attempt to seize its gold mines. The exact motives for and directions of the Iazyges&#x27; war efforts are not known. Marcus Claudius Fronto, who was a general during the Parthian wars and then the governor of both Dacia and Upper Moesia, held them back for some time but was killed in battle in 170. The Quadi surrendered in 172, the first tribe to do so; the known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client-king Furtius on their throne and the Quadi were denied access to the Roman markets along the limes. The Marcomanni accepted a similar peace but the name of their client-king is not known.

In 173, the Quadi rebelled and overthrew Furtius and replaced him with Ariogaesus, who wanted to enter into negotiations with Marcus. Marcus refused to negotiate because the success of the Marcomannic wars was in no danger. At that point the Iazyges had not yet been defeated by Rome. having not acted, Marcus Aurelius appears to have been unconcerned, but when the Iazyges attacked across the frozen Danube in late 173 and early 174, Marcus redirected his attention to them. Trade restrictions on the Marcomanni were also partially lifted at that time; they were allowed to visit the Roman markets at certain times of certain days. In an attempt to force Marcus to negotiate, Ariogaesus began to support the Iazyges. Marcus Aurelius put out a bounty on him, offering 1,000 aurei for his capture and delivery to Rome or 500 aurei for his severed head. After this, the Romans captured Ariogaesus but rather than executing him, Marcus Aurelius sent him into exile.

In the winter of 173, the Iazyges launched a raid across the frozen Danube but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed them back to the Danube. Knowing the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to do so without slipping, the Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter the Romans as they tried to cross the frozen river. The Roman army, however, formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields so they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counter-attacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing their spears, clothing, and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after slipping on the ice and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges—and presumably the Sarmatians in general—were declared the primary enemy of Rome.

The Iazyges surrendered to the Romans in March or early April of 175. Their prince Banadaspus had attempted peace in early 174 but the offer was refused and Banadaspus was deposed by the Iazyges and replaced with Zanticus. The terms of the peace treaty were harsh; the Iazyges were required to provide 8,000 men as auxiliaries and release 100,000 Romans they had taken hostage, and were forbidden from living within ten Roman miles (roughly of the Danube. Marcus had intended to impose even harsher terms; it is said by Cassius Dio that he wanted to entirely exterminate the Iazyges but was distracted by the rebellion of Avidius Cassius. During this peace deal, Marcus Aurelius broke from the Roman custom of Emperors sending details of peace treaties to the Roman Senate; this is the only instance in which Marcus Aurelius is recorded to have broken this tradition. Of the 8,000 auxiliaries, 5,500 of them were sent to Britannia to serve with the Legio VI Victrix, suggesting that the situation there was serious; it is likely the British tribes, seeing the Romans being preoccupied with war in Germania and Dacia, had decided to rebel. All of the evidence suggests the Iazyges&#x27; horsemen were an impressive success. The 5,500 troops sent to Britain were not allowed to return home, even after their 20-year term of service had ended. After Marcus Aurelius had beaten the Iazyges; he took the title of &quot;Sarmaticus&quot; in accordance with the Roman practice of victory titles.

===After the Marcomannic Wars===
In 177, the Iazyges, the Buri, and other Germanic tribes invaded Roman territory again. It is said that in 178, Marcus Aurelius took the bloody spear from the Temple of Bellona and hurled it into the land of the Iazyges. In 179, the Iazyges and the Buri were defeated, and the Iazyges accepted peace with Rome. The peace treaty placed additional restrictions on the Iazyges but also included some concessions. They could not settle on any of the islands of the Danube and could not keep boats on the Danube. They were, however, permitted to visit and trade with the Roxolani throughout the Dacian Province with the knowledge and approval of its governor, and they could trade in the Roman markets at certain times on certain days. In 179, the Iazyges and the Buri joined Rome in their war against the Quadi and the Marcomanni after they secured assurances that Rome would prosecute the war to the end and not quickly make a peace deal.

As part of a treaty made in 183, Commodus forbade the Quadi and the Marcomanni from waging war against the Iazyges, the Buri, or the Vandals, suggesting that at this time all three tribes were loyal client-tribes of Rome. In 214, however, Caracalla led an invasion into the Iazyges&#x27; territory. In 236, the Iazyges invaded Rome but were defeated by Emperor Maximinus Thrax, who took the title Sarmaticus Maximus following his victory. The Iazyges, Marcomanni, and Quadi raided Pannonia together in 248, and again in 254. It is suggested the reason for the large increase in the amount of Iazyx raids against Rome was that the Goths led successful raids, which emboldened the Iazyges and other tribes. In 260, the Goths took the cities of Tyras and Olbia, again cutting off the Iazyges&#x27; trade with the Pontic Steppe and the Black Sea. From 282 to 283, Emperor Carus lead a successful campaign against the Iazyges.

The Iazyges and Carpi raided Roman territory in 293, and Diocletian responded by declaring war. From 294 to 295, Diocletian waged war upon them and won. As a result of the war, some of the Carpi were transported into Roman territory so they could be controlled. From 296 to 298, Galerius successfully campaigned against the Iazyges. In 358, the Iazyges were at war with Rome. In 375, Emperor Valentinian had a stroke in Brigetio while meeting with envoys from the Iazyges. Around the time of the Gothic migration, which led the Iazyges to be surrounded on their northern and eastern borders by Gothic tribes, and most intensely during the reign of Constantine I, a series of earthworks known as the Devil&#x27;s Dykes (Ördögárok) was built around the Iazygian territory, possibly with a degree of Roman involvement. Higham suggests that the Iazyges became more heavily tied to the Romans during this period, with strong cultural influence.

===Late history and legacy===

In late antiquity, historic accounts become much more diffuse and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. Beginning in the 4th century, most Roman authors cease to distinguish between the different Sarmatian tribes, and instead refer to all as Sarmatians. In the late 4th century, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned—the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived on opposite sides of the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Roxolani conquered the Iazyges, after which the Iazyges became the Limigantes and the Roxolani became the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen who gradually migrated into the area were subservient to the Iazyges; the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Yet another theory holds that the Roxolani were integrated into the Iazyges. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both tribes were conquered by the Goths and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.

==Foreign relations==
===The Roman Empire===
The Iazyges often harassed the Roman Empire after their arrival in the Pannonian Basin, but they never rose to become a true threat. During the 1st century, Rome used diplomacy to secure their northern borders, especially on the Danube, by way of befriending the tribes, and by sowing distrust amongst the tribes against each other. Rome defended their Danubian border not just by way of repelling raids, but also by levying diplomatic influence against the tribes and launching punitive expeditions. The combination of diplomatic influence and swift punitive expeditions allowed the Romans to force the various tribes, including the Iazyges, into becoming client states of the Roman Empire. Even after the Romans abandoned Dacia, they consistently projected their power north of the Danube against the Sarmatian tribes, especially during the reigns of Constantine, Constantius II, and Valentinian. To this end, Constantine constructed a permanent bridge across the middle Danube in order to improve logistics for campaigns against the Goths and Sarmatians.

Another key part of the relationship between the Roman Empire and the Sarmatian tribes was the settling of tribes in Roman lands, with emperors often accepting refugees from the Sarmatian tribes into nearby Roman territory. When the Huns arrived in the Russian steppes and conquered the tribes that were there, they often lacked the martial ability to force the newly conquered tribes to stay, leading to tribes like the Greuthungi, Vandals, Alans, and Goths migrating and settling within the Roman Empire rather than remaining subjects of the Huns. The Roman Empire benefited from accepting these refugee tribes, and thus continued to allow them to settle, even after treaties were made with Hunnic leaders such as Rugila and Attila that stipulated that the Roman Empire would reject all refugee tribes, with rival or subject tribes of the Huns being warmly received by Roman leaders in the Balkans.

====Archeology====
Around the time of Trajan, the Romans established routes between Dacia and Pannonia, with evidence of Roman goods appearing in Iazygian land occurring around 100AD, largely centered near important river crossings. Additionally, a small number of Roman inscriptions and buildings were made during this period, which scholar Nicholas Higham states suggests either a high degree of Romanization or the presence of diplomatic or military posts within Iazygian territory. Roman goods were widespread in the second and early third centuryAD, especially near Aquincum, the capital of Roman Pannonia Inferior, and the area east to the Tizsa valley.

===Roxolani===
The Iazyges also had a strong relationship with the Roxolani, another Sarmatian tribe, both economically and diplomatically. During the second Dacian War, where the Iazyges supported the Romans, while the Roxolani supported the Dacians, the Iazyges and Roxolani remained neutral to each other. After the Roman annexation of Dacia, the two tribes were effectively isolated from each other, until the 179 peace concession from Emperor Marcus Aurelius which permitted the Iazyges and Roxolani to travel through Dacia, subject to the approval of the governor. Because of the new concession allowing them to trade with the Roxolani they could, for the first time in several centuries, trade indirectly with the Pontic Steppe and the Black Sea. It is believed the Iazyges traveled through Small Wallachia until they reached the Wallachian Plain, but there is little archeological evidence to prove this. Cypraea shells began to appear in this area in the last quarter of the 2nd century.

===Quadi===
The scholar Higham suggests that there was some degree of &quot;long-term collaboration&quot; between the Iazyges and the Quadi, noting that they were allied in the late 2nd centuryAD, and that the Iazyges ceded the western portions of their land to them shortly after arriving in the Pannonian Basin, apparently without conflict.

<text>The Roxolani or Rhoxolāni ( , ; ) were a Sarmatian people documented between the 2nd century BC and the 4th century AD, first east of the Borysthenes (Dnieper) on the coast of Lake Maeotis (Sea of Azov), and later near the borders of Roman Dacia and Moesia. They are believed to be an offshoot of the Alans.

==Name==
The name &quot;Roxolani&quot; is generally interpreted as a compound formed with the Alanic root * (modern Ossetian or &#x27;light, luminous&#x27;; Avestan and Persian , &#x27;luminous, shining&#x27;) attached to the tribal name &quot;Alān&quot;. This would make &quot;Roxolani&quot; an endonym translatable as the &#x27;luminous&#x27; or the &#x27;shining Alans&#x27;. The name could be linked to aspects of worship or the supernatural, as suggested by the modern Ossetian expression (&#x27;may you be blessed&#x27;), addressed to the deceased, or the name &quot;Wacyrūxs&quot; (&#x27;divine light&#x27;), mentioned in the Nart sagas.&quot;&quot;

Historian George Vernadsky suggested that the &quot;Rocas&quot; (or &quot;Rogas&quot;), a tribe conquered by the Ostrogoths in the 4th century, may be a corruption of &quot;Ruxs-As.&quot; He also argued that the Rosomoni mentioned by Jordanes could be also related, and their name interpreted as the &#x27;Ros Men&#x27;.

==Geography==
Their first recorded homeland lay between the Volga, Don and Dnieper rivers; they migrated in the 1st century AD toward the Danube, to what is now the Baragan steppes in Romania.

==History==
===1st century BC===
Around 100 BC, they invaded the Crimea under their king Tasius in support of the Scythian warlord Palacus but were defeated by Diophantus, general of Mithradates VI.

===1st century AD===
In the mid-1st century AD, the Roxolani began incursions across the Danube into Roman territory. One such raid in AD 68/69 was intercepted by the Legio III Gallica with Roman auxiliaries, who destroyed a raiding force of 9,000 Roxolanian cavalry encumbered by baggage. Tacitus describes the weight of the armour worn by the &quot;princes and most distinguished persons&quot; made &quot;it difficult for such as have been overthrown by the charge of the enemy to regain their feet&quot;. The long two-handed kontos lance, the primary melee weapon of the Sarmatians, was unusable in these conditions. The Roxolani avenged themselves in AD 92, when they joined the Dacians in destroying the Roman Legio XXI Rapax.

===2nd century===
During Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars, the Roxolani at first sided with the Dacians, providing them with most of their cavalry strength, but they were defeated in the first campaign of AD 101–102 at Nicopolis ad Istrum. They appear to have stood aside as neutrals during Trajan&#x27;s final campaign of AD 105–106, which ended in the complete destruction of the Dacian state. The creation of the Roman province of Dacia brought Roman power to the very doorstep of Roxolani territory. The Emperor Hadrian reinforced a series of pre-existing fortifications and built numerous forts along the Danube to contain the Roxolani threat. Later, Marcus Aurelius also campaigned against the Roxolani along the Danubian frontier.

===3rd century===
They are known to have attacked the Roman Province of Pannonia in 260; shortly afterwards contingents of Roxolani troops entered Roman military service.

===4th century===
Like other Sarmatian peoples, the Roxolani were conquered by the Huns in the mid-4th century.

==Culture==
The Greco-Roman historian Strabo (late 1st century BC-early 1st century AD) described them as &quot;wagon-dwellers&quot; (i.e. nomads). According to him, they were the most remote of Scythian peoples.

== Legacy ==
George Vernadsky theorized about the association of Rus and Alans. He claimed that &quot;Ruxs&quot; in Alanic means &quot;radiant light&quot;, thus the ethnonym &quot;Roxolani&quot; could be understood as &quot;bright Alans&quot;. He theorized that the name &quot;Roxolani&quot; a combination of two separate tribal names: the Rus and the Alans. It is not widely accepted. The most common theory about the origin of the word &quot;Russian&quot; is the Germanic version. The name &quot;Rus&quot;″, like the Proto-Finnic name for Sweden (&quot;*roocci&quot;), from which the modern Finnish name &quot;Ruotsi&quot; is derived, is supposed to be descended from an Old Norse term meaning &quot;the men who row&quot; (&quot;rods-&quot;).

<doc id="140471" wikidata="Q1168491" url="?curid=140471" title="Charlie Brown">
<text>Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Brown is the principal character of the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, syndicated in daily and Sunday newspapers in numerous countries all over the world. Depicted as a &quot;lovable loser&quot;, Charlie Brown is one of the great American archetypes and a popular and widely recognized cartoon character. Charlie Brown is characterized as a person who frequently suffers, and as a result, is usually nervous and lacks self-confidence. He shows both pessimistic and optimistic attitudes: on some days, he is apprehensive to even get out of bed because he is unable to face the world, but on others, he hopes to accomplish things and is determined to do his best. Charlie Brown is easily recognized by his round head and trademark zigzag patterned shirt. His catchphrase is &quot;Good Grief!&quot;

The character&#x27;s creator, Charles M. Schulz, said that Charlie Brown &quot;has to be the one who suffers, because he is a caricature of the average person. Most of us are much more acquainted with losing than we are with winning.&quot; Despite this, Charlie Brown does not always suffer, as he has experienced some happy moments and victories through the years, and he has sometimes uncharacteristically shown self-assertiveness despite his frequent nervousness. Schulz also said: &quot;I like to have Charlie Brown eventually be the focal point of almost every story.&quot; Charlie Brown is the only &quot;Peanuts&quot; character to have appeared regularly in the strip throughout its entire 50-year run.

Lee Mendelson, producer of the majority of the Peanuts television specials, has said of Charlie Brown that &quot;He was, and is, the ultimate survivor in overcoming bulliness—Lucy or otherwise.&quot;

Charlie Brown is eight years old for most of the strip&#x27;s floating timeline. Initially, he suggests he lives in an apartment, with his grandmother occupying the one above his; a few years into the strip, he moves to a house with a backyard. He is always referred to as &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; and never simply &quot;Charlie&quot; by most of the other characters in the strip, including his sister, Sally (who also refers to him as &quot;big brother&quot;) and Snoopy, his dog (who sometimes calls him &quot;the round-headed kid&quot;), with the exception of Peppermint Patty and Marcie who address him as &quot;Chuck&quot; and &quot;Charles&quot; respectively.

== History ==
=== 1940s–1950s ===

The character&#x27;s name was first used on May 30, 1948, in an early Schulz comic strip titled &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot;. The character made his official debut in the first &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip on October 2, 1950. The strip features Charlie Brown walking by, as two other children named Shermy and Patty look at him. Shermy refers to him as &quot;Good Ol&#x27; Charlie Brown&quot; as he passes by, but then immediately reveals his hatred toward him once he is gone on the last panel. In the very early days of the strip, Charlie Brown was explicitly identified as being four years old; he would age very slowly over the next several years, being old enough to attend elementary school by the 1960s. During the strip&#x27;s early years, Charlie Brown was much more impish and lighthearted and not the dour defeatist he would soon become. He was something of a smart-aleck and would often play pranks and jokes on the other characters. On December 21, 1950, his signature zig-zag pattern first appeared on his formerly plain T-shirt. By April 25, 1952, his T-shirt was changed to a polo shirt with a collar and the zig-zag. On the March 6, 1951, strip, Charlie Brown first appears to play baseball, as he was warming up before telling Shermy that they can start the game; however, he was the catcher and not yet the pitcher and manager of his team.

Charlie Brown&#x27;s relationships with other &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters initially differed significantly from their later states, and their concepts were grown up through this decade until they reached their more-established forms. An example is his relationship with Violet Gray, to whom he was introduced in the February 7, 1951, strip. The two constantly remained on fairly good terms, a bit different from their later somewhat tepid relationship. In the August 16, 1951, strip, she called Charlie Brown a &quot;blockhead&quot;, being the first time Charlie Brown was referred by that insult. The strip for November 14 of that year featured the first appearance of the famous football gag, with Violet in the role that would later be filled by Lucy.

On May 30, 1951, Charlie Brown is introduced to Schroeder. As Schroeder is still a baby, Charlie Brown cannot converse with him. On June 1 of the same year, Charlie Brown stated that he felt like a father to Schroeder; in fact, for quite some time, he sometimes acted like a father to him, trying to teach him words and reading stories to him. On September 24 of that year, he taught Schroeder how to play the piano, the instrument which would later become Schroeder&#x27;s trademark. On that year&#x27;s October 10, strip, he told Schroeder the story of Beethoven and set in motion the piano player&#x27;s obsession with the composer. Charlie Brown placed the Beethoven bust on Schroeder&#x27;s piano on November 26, 1951. Later, Schroeder and Charlie Brown were portrayed as being about the same age, and Schroeder became Charlie Brown&#x27;s closest friend after Linus Van Pelt. Schroeder became the catcher on Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team for the first time in the April 12, 1952, strip.

In early 1959, Charlie Brown (and other &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters) made his first animated appearances after they were sponsored by the Ford Motor Company in commercials for its automobiles, as well as for intros to &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show. &quot;The ads were animated by Bill Melendez for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client.

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, the &quot;Peanuts &quot;comic strip entered what most readers consider to be its Golden Age, reaching its peak in popularity, becoming well known in numerous countries, with the strip reaching 355 million readers.

In 1965, the Coca-Cola Company approached Lee Mendelson about sponsoring a &quot;Peanuts&quot; Christmas television special. The next day Mendelson called Schulz and proposed a Christmas special featuring Charlie Brown and the &quot;Peanuts &quot;characters, in which he would collaborate with both Schulz and Melendez. Titled &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, the special was first broadcast by the CBS network on December 9, 1965. The special&#x27;s primary goal is showing &quot;the true meaning of Christmas&quot;. Before &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was broadcast, several of those involved in the special&#x27;s creation were worried that it might be poorly received, with its unorthodox soundtrack and overt religious message; however, it turned out to be a huge success, with the number of homes watching the special an estimated 15,490,000, placing it at number two in the ratings, behind &quot;Bonanza&quot; on NBC. The special&#x27;s music score made an equally pervasive impact on viewers who would later perform jazz, among them David Benoit and George Winston. &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was honored with both an Emmy and Peabody Award.

The success of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas &quot;was followed by the creation of a second CBS television special, &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All-Stars&quot;, which was originally broadcast on June 8, 1966. In October of that year,a third &quot;Peanuts&quot; special was broadcast on CBS: the Halloween-themed &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;.

The stage adaptation of a concept album titled &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, based on Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, and Patty, went into rehearsal in New York City on February 10, 1967. Prior to its opening, the musical had no actual libretto; it was several vignettes with dialogue adapted from &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips and a musical number for each one. Since Patty was such a weakly defined character in Schulz&#x27;s strip, she became a composite character in the musical, with much of her material originating with Violet and Frieda in the strip. On March 7, 1967, the musical premiered off-Broadway at Theatre 80 in the East Village, featuring Gary Burghoff as Charlie Brown.

On December 4, 1969, &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, the first feature-length animated film based on &quot;Peanuts&quot; was released. The film was a box office success, earning 6 million dollars at the box office, against its 1 million dollar budget. The film was generally well received by critics.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969, when they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for the Apollo 10 mission. While not included in the official mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission. Charles Schulz drew an original picture of Charlie Brown in a spacesuit; this drawing was hidden aboard the craft to be found by the astronauts once they were in orbit. Its current location is on a display at the Kennedy Space Center.

=== 1970s ===
During the 1970s, Charlie Brown appeared in twelve &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials that were produced as a result of the success of the earlier TV specials. Charlie Brown also appeared in two animated feature films (&quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; and &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot;, released on August 9, 1972, and August 24, 1977, respectively).

=== 1980s ===
Fourteen more &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials were produced in the 1980s, two of which were musicals (one is the animated version of &quot;You&#x27;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;).

Another full-length animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; film, titled &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don&#x27;t Come Back!!)&quot; was released on May 30, 1980.

=== 1990s ===
Six television specials featuring Charlie Brown were produced during this decade.

Within the comic strip, a storyline got Charlie Brown the character Peggy Jean as a girlfriend; this relationship lasted for roughly nine years.

=== Final comic strip appearance ===

Charlie Brown made his final appearance in the very last original &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, which was published on February 13, 2000—the day following Schulz&#x27;s death. Despite ending its original run in 2000, repeats of the comic strip are still being published as of 2024.

=== Post-comic strip appearances ===
After the comic strip ended, Charlie Brown continued to appear in more television specials. On November 20, 2006, the special &quot;He&#x27;s a Bully, Charlie Brown&quot; beat a Madonna concert special with its 10 million views, although &quot;Peanuts&quot; was no longer in its heyday. As of 2016, the latest of Charlie Brown&#x27;s original television appearances is &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown&quot;, which came out on October 1, 2011.

=== &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; ===

An animated film starring Charlie Brown, &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, was released on November 6, 2015. The film was directed by Steve Martino, produced by Blue Sky Studios, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The director said of the character: &quot;We&#x27;ve all been Charlie Brown at one point in our lives&quot;.

The film received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and grossed $246 million worldwide against its $99 million budget, making it a box office success.

== Inspiration ==
Charlie Brown&#x27;s traits and experiences are inspired by those of Schulz, who admitted in interviews that he had often felt shy and withdrawn in his life. In an interview on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; in May 1997, Schulz observed: &quot;I suppose there&#x27;s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists, because cartooning, like all other humor, comes from bad things happening.&quot; Furthermore, both Charlie Brown&#x27;s and Schulz&#x27;s fathers were barbers, and their mothers housewives. Charlie Brown&#x27;s friends, such as Linus and Shermy, were named after good friends of Schulz, and Peppermint Patty was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of Schulz&#x27;s cousins on his mother&#x27;s side. Schulz devised the character&#x27;s name when he saw peppermint candies in his house. Even Charlie Brown&#x27;s unrequited love for the Little Red-Haired Girl was inspired by Schulz&#x27;s own love for Donna Mae Johnson, an Art Instruction Inc. accountant. When Schulz finally proposed to her in June 1950, shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate, she turned him down and married another man.

==Personality==
Charlie Brown is a shy, meek, kind, innocent, gentle-hearted character with many anxieties.

Charlie Brown is normally referred to by his full name (with the exceptions of Peppermint Patty who calls him &quot;Chuck&quot;, Marcie, Eudora, Violette and Emily who call him &#x27;Charles&#x27;, Peggy Jean who calls him &quot;Brownie Charles&quot;, and Sally who calls him &quot;Big Brother&quot;, though on extremely rare occasions, Lucy, Violet, Patty and Frieda did call him just &quot;Charlie&quot;). Charlie Brown&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;good grief&quot;. Like Schulz, Charlie Brown is the son of a barber. The character is an example of &quot;the great American un-success story&quot; in that he fails in almost everything he does with an almost continuous streak of bad luck; but still keeps trying with huge efforts and work, resulting in either more losses or (very rarely) great victories. Some of these victories are hitting a game-winning home run off a pitch by a minor character named Royanne on a strip from 1993, and his victory over Joe Agate (another minor character) in a game of marbles on a strip from 1995. Although Charlie Brown is often unlucky within the strip&#x27;s storylines, in some ways Charles M. Schulz created through the ever-persevering character &quot;the most shining example of the American success story in the comic strip field.&quot;

Charlie Brown cares very deeply for his family and friends, even if he was maltreated by them. His care for his sister is shown on a strip from May 26, 1959, when he reacts to the birth of his sister Sally by exclaiming &quot;A BABY SISTER?! I&#x27;M A FATHER! I mean my DAD&#x27;s a father! I&#x27;m a brother! I have a baby sister! I&#x27;m a brother!&quot; Two strips later, Charlie Brown continues the celebration of her birth by handing over chocolate cigars to his friends. When Charlie Brown was maltreated by his companions (most often Lucy, Violet and Patty), he does not usually take out his anger on them, but often retaliates and even manages to turn the tables. An example is a strip from 1951, which features Violet and Patty telling Charlie Brown that they are not going to invite him to their party, with Charlie Brown replying that he does not wish to go to their &quot;dumb ol&#x27; party&quot; anyway, leading the two girls to invite him.

Christopher Caldwell has stated that &quot;What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he&#x27;s not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly &quot;not&quot; self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can &quot;earn&quot; a sense of self-worth, and his willingness to do so by exposing himself to humiliations is the dramatic engine that drives the strip. The greatest of Charlie Brown&#x27;s virtues is his resilience, which is to say his courage. Charlie Brown is ambitious. He &quot;manages&quot; the baseball team. He&#x27;s the pitcher, not a scrub. He may be a loser, but he&#x27;s, strangely, a leader at the same time. This makes his mood swings truly bipolar in their magnificence: he vacillates not between kinda happy and kinda unhappy, but between being a &quot;hero&quot; and being a &quot;goat&quot;.&quot;

===Birthday and age===
Charlie Brown&#x27;s age is neither normally specified nor consistently given. His birthday occurs in the strip published on October 30, 1950. He is four years old in a strip published November 3, 1950. He aged slowly over the next two decades of the strip&#x27;s floating timeline, being six years old as of November 17, 1957, and &quot;eight-and-a-half years old&quot; by July 11, 1979. Other references continue to peg Charlie Brown as being approximately eight years old.
A strip published on April 3, 1971, suggests he was born around 1963 (setting up the gag that when he is 21, it will be 1984).

==Reception==
Charlie Brown, along with Snoopy, was ranked eighth on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time.

===Shrine of the Eternals===

Charlie Brown was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2017. Similar in concept to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, criteria for inclusion in the Shrine of the Eternals differs in that statistical achievement is not a primary consideration for induction, and fictional characters are eligible for induction. Charlie Brown was the first fictional character inducted to the Shrine.

<doc id="140473" wikidata="Q3237" url="?curid=140473" title="Rügen">
<text>Rügen (; Rani: Rȯjana, Rāna; , ) is Germany&#x27;s largest island. It is located off the Pomeranian coast in the Baltic Sea and belongs to the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

The &quot;gateway&quot; to Rügen island is the Hanseatic city of Stralsund, where it is linked to the mainland by road and railway via the Rügen Bridge and Causeway, two routes crossing the two-kilometre-wide Strelasund, a sound of the Baltic Sea.

Rügen has a maximum length of (from north to south), a maximum width of in the south and an area of . The coast is characterised by numerous sandy beaches, lagoons () and open bays (), as well as peninsulas and headlands. In June 2011, UNESCO awarded the status of a World Heritage Site to the Jasmund National Park, characterised by vast stands of beeches and chalk cliffs like King&#x27;s Chair, the main landmark of Rügen island.

The island of Rügen is part of the district of Vorpommern-Rügen, with its county seat in Stralsund.

The towns on Rügen are: Bergen, Sassnitz, Putbus and Garz. In addition, there are the Baltic seaside resorts of Binz, Baabe, Göhren, Sellin and Thiessow.

Rügen is very popular as a tourist destination because of its resort architecture, the diverse landscape and its long, sandy beaches.

== Geology ==
The chalk cliffs of the Jasmund peninsula belong to the Rügen Chalk unit and were formed during the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago.

== Geography ==
The main body of the island, known as Muttland, is surrounded by several peninsulas. To the north lie the peninsulas of Wittow and Jasmund, connected to each other by the Schaabe sandbar and to Muttland by the Schmale Heide, an embankment at Lietzow and the Wittow Ferry. The northern peninsulas are separated from Muttland by several lagoons or , the largest of which are the Großer Jasmunder Bodden and Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden. Major peninsulas in the south are Zudar and Mönchgut which both face the Bay of Greifswald. Strelasund separates the island from the southern mainland.
Rügen has a total area of , or if the adjacent small islands are included. The maximum diameter is from north to south, and from east to west. Of an overall coastline, are sandy Baltic Sea beaches, and sandy beaches. The highest elevations are on the Jasmund peninsula: Piekberg () and Königsstuhl ().

The northern part of the Bay of Greifswald, the Rügischer Bodden, is a large bay in the south of Rügen island, with the island of Vilm lying just offshore. At the western end of the bay, the peninsula of Zudar runs out to the southernmost point of Rügen (Palmer Ort), at the eastern end the highly indented peninsula of Mönchgut projects into the sea. This peninsula ends in the east at the cape of Nordperd near Göhren and in the south at the cape of &quot;Südperd&quot; by Thiessow. In the west of the peninsula of Mönchgut a narrow, bar, the Reddevitz Höft, separates the two bays of Having and Hagensche Wiek.
In the north-east of the island of Rügen is formed by the peninsula of Jasmund, which is joined to the heart of the island, &quot;Muttland&quot;, by the bar of Schmale Heide between Binz-Prora and Sassnitz-Mukran and by a rail and road embankment at Lietzow. The Schmale Heide separates the outer bay of Prorer Wiek from the lagoon of the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden. On the peninsula of Jasmund are the Piekberg (), the highest point on Rügen, and the Königsstuhl, a chalk cliff in Stubbenkammer, which forms the most striking landmark on the island. Another bar, the Schaabe, links Jasmund to the peninsula of Wittow in the north of Rügen. The Schaabe, in turn, separates the outer bay of Tromper Wiek from the lagoon of the Großer Jasmunder Bodden. The peninsula of Wittow and the long, narrow peninsula of Bug to the west are separated from the main body of Rügen by the Rassower Strom, the Breetzer Bodden and the &quot;Breeger Bodden&quot;. The Wittow peninsula is adjoined in the north by Cape Arkona. Just under a kilometre to the northwest, located at 54°41&#x27; N, is the northernmost point of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Below this cliff () on the shoreline is the Siebenschneidersteinthe fourth largest glacial erratic boulder on Rügen.

The northwestern and western sides of Rügen are also highly indented, but a little flatter. Offshore are the larger islands of Hiddensee and Ummanz as well as the smaller islands Öhe Liebitz and Heuwiese. Sand removal and deposition by the Baltic Sea has to be constantly countered by dredging operations to the north and south of Hiddensee, otherwise Hiddensee would merge with Rügen within a few years. Rügen is dotted with many glacial erratic boulders, of which the 22 largest belong to legally-protected geotopes (&quot;see also: Erratics on and around Rügen).

=== Land use ===
The heartland of Rügen is gently rolling, and the area is characterised primarily by agriculture. East of the town of Bergen auf Rügen the land climbs to 90 metres (295&#x27;) (at Rugard where there is an observation tower) and to 107 metres (351&#x27;) in the southeastern hill country of the Granitz. The soil on Rügen is very fertile and productive, particularly in Wittow, the breadbasket of the island. There are major cabbage-producing regions.

Two German national parks are situated on Rügen: the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park, in the west (including Hiddensee), and the Jasmund National Park, a smaller park including the chalk cliffs (Königsstuhl). There is also a nature reserve, the Southeast Rügen Biosphere Reserve, consisting of the peninsulas in the southeast.
=== Climate ===

The climate is in the temperate zone. According to the Köppen climate classification the northern parts of the island and the coastal regions (apart from those lay adjacent to Strelasund) are under the influence of the oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), meanwhile the remaining majority of the area is dominated by the humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). The winters are not particularly cold, with mean temperatures in January and February of ; and summers are mild and temperate, with a mean temperature in August of . There is an average rainfall of and approximately 1800–1870 hours of sunshine annually.

== Administration ==
Administratively, Rügen is part of the district Vorpommern-Rügen. Its subdivisions are the Bergen auf Rügen (municipalities Bergen auf Rügen, Buschvitz, Garz, Gustow, Lietzow, Parchtitz, Patzig, Poseritz, Ralswiek, Rappin, Sehlen and Thesenvitz), West-Rügen (municipalities Altefähr, Dreschvitz, Gingst, Hiddensee, Kluis, Neuenkirchen, Rambin, Samtens, Schaprode, Trent and Ummanz), Nord-Rügen (municipalities Altenkirchen, Breege, Dranske, Glowe, Lohme, Putgarten, Sagard, Wiek) and Mönchgut-Granitz (municipalities Baabe, Göhren, Lancken-Granitz, Middelhagen, Sellin, Thiessow and Zirkow) and the Amt-free municipalities of Binz, Putbus and Sassnitz. Overall, there are 45 municipalities on Rügen, four of which have town status (Bergen, Garz, Putbus and Sassnitz).

== History ==

=== Pre-history and the Germani ===

Discoveries in the indicate that there has been settlement here since the Stone Age. All over Rügen are numerous stone monuments, such as megalithic tombs and altar stones that have survived to the present day. By the 1st century, the inhabitants of Rügen were part of the East Germanic tribe of Rugii, who occupied roughly the region that was later to become Western Pomerania and who gave the island its name. The Rugii may have originated from Scandinavia or evolved from autochthonous tribes. In the Migration Period, many Rugii moved south and founded an empire in Pannonia.

=== Slavic Rani ===
From the 7th century, the West Slavic Rani (or Rujani) built an empire on Rügen and the neighbouring coast between Recknitz and Ryck. It decidedly affected the history of the Baltic Sea area and the surrounding Obodritic (in the west) and Liutician (in the south) occupied mainland for the next few centuries. Many traces of their life can be found today.
The basis of their military strength was a combination of the Ranian navy and a favourable location. Denmark, which was at that time very successful in Great Britain and Scandinavia, was neither able to match its Ranian rivals in the Baltic Sea region nor protect its coastline from Ranian armies until well into the 12th century. Meanwhile, the Ranians built numerous castles and temples in the Barth-Jasmund-Gristow triangle.

The temple hill of Jaromarsburg, at the northern tip of Rügen and dedicated to the god Svetovid, was significant well beyond the boundaries of the Ranian empire. After the fall of Radgosc it became the chief shrine for the pagan northwestern Slavs. The administrative centre of the empire was Charenza, possibly on the site of the present-day hillfort known as Garz or Venz. The main trading centre of the empire was Ralswiek at the southernmost point of the Großer Jasmunder Bodden.

=== Principality under Danish suzerainty ===
In 1168, the Danish king, Valdemar I, and his army commander and advisor, Bishop Absalon of Roskilde destroyed the Svetovid temple in the hillfort at Cape Arkona, ending both the territorial and religious autonomy of the Rani; their former monarchs became Danish princes of Rügen. The Rani prince Jaromar I (died 1218) was a vassal of the Danish king and Christianized the island&#x27;s inhabitants. In 1184, the Pomeranians, whose rule had previously extended as far as the land of Gützkow and to Demmin and thus made them the immediate neighbours of the now Danish Principality of Rugia, were commissioned by their overlord, the Holy Roman Emperor, to seize Rügen for the empire, but were defeated in the Bay of Greifswald.

Under Danish rule the Principality of Rugia changed its character. Danish monasteries were established (e.g. Bergen Abbey in 1193 and Hilda Abbey, today Eldena Abbey, in 1199). German colonists were introduced into the land and soon they became the largest and most culturally influential group within the population. The Slavic cultural element disappeared, mostly due to the lack of their own Slavic church structures, so that the Rani were absorbed in the period that followed into the now German-influenced people of Rügen. In addition to the colonization of the country and the building of new monasteries and churches, towns were also re-established. In 1234, the Rügen Prince Wizlaw I founded the town of Stralsund and granted Greifswald market rights in 1241. The power of the towns grew rapidly, forcing Rügen&#x27;s rulers to make concessions—for example, the prince&#x27;s castle at Barth was slighted and Schadegast, the princely &quot;twin&quot; of the municipally-controlled Stralsund, was ousted in favour of the latter.

In 1304 a storm surge, known as the All Saints&#x27; Flood, devastated the island and flooded the peninsula between Mönchgut and Ruden.

=== Part of Pomerania ===
After the death of the last Slav prince of the &quot;Wizlawiden&quot; (&quot;House of Wizlaw&quot;) dynasty, Wizlaw III, in 1325, the principality was acquired by the duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast as a consequence of the 1321 inheritance agreement (), and from 1368/72–1451 was part of the estate of a branch line, the dukes of Pomerania-Barth. This state of affairs, together with the disputes over the Danish throne that occurred at that time, led to the Rügen wars of succession. After they had played out, the former principality went in 1354 to Pomerania-Wolgast and thus became part of the Holy Roman Empire. 

In 1478, Pomerania-Wolgast and Pomerania-Stettin were united and, 170 years later, the combined state went to Sweden in 1648 as a result of the Treaty of Westphalia (see Swedish Pomerania). Rügen was part of Swedish Pomerania from 1648 to 1815. The largest landowners, owning at least one-fifth of the island until 1945, was the House of Putbus, which was an offshoot of the earlier ruling princes of the Wizlawid dynasty. In 1727, they were created counts of Holy Roman Empire and 1731 counts in Sweden, ultimately Swedish princes in 1807.

Under Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden the town of Gustavia was constructed on the Mönchgut peninsula, but was abandoned during the Napoleonic Wars. In the years 1678 and 1715, Rügen was briefly wrested from the Swedes by the Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William and by the King in Prussia, Frederick William I. For example, a Brandenburg-Danish army landed on the island as part of the invasion of Rügen in 1678. After the Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1679 the island passed from Danish to Swedish ownership again. At the time of Napoleonic Wars, Rügen was held by the French from 1807 to 1813. In the Treaty of Kiel of 1814, it was transferred initially from Sweden to Denmark and then fell to Prussia, along with New Western Pomerania (), thanks to the Vienna Convention of 1815. In 1818, the island became part of the administrative district of Stralsund and thus belonged to the Prussian Province of Pomerania. Wilhelm Malte I (1783–1854), 1st prince of Putbus, was the last Governor of Swedish Pomerania and the first under Prussian rule.
In 1816, the first bathing resort was founded at Putbus. Later more resorts were established, and Rügen remained the most popular holiday resort of Germany until World War II.

=== German Empire ===
Rügen was a popular destination for exile of Catholic priests and clergy during &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; between 1875 and 1879.

=== Nazi era ===

The Nazis added a large resort: Prora, planned by the Strength through Joy organisation, which aimed to occupy people&#x27;s free time. However, Prora was never completed.

In 1936, the first bridge connecting Rügen with the mainland was constructed (Rügendamm), replacing the former ferry shuttles.

The operation commanded by Wolfram von Richthofen that bombed the town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, was named after the island. An Abwehr Signals intelligence Operation during the same conflict was titled Operation Bodden after the strait separating Rügen from the German mainland.

In the aftermath of World War II, East German and Soviet authorities exiled landholders from the mainland to the island.

=== GDR era ===
After the Second World War, Rügen became part of the state of Mecklenburg within the German Democratic Republic (GDR). In 1952, the island became part of the district of Rostock.

The island was the focal point of Project Rose (&quot;Action Rose&quot;) by the GDR government designed to nationalise hotels, taxis and service companies on 10 February 1953. The occasion was supposed to have been a visit by Walter Ulbricht to the island of Rügen, during which he had been annoyed by the many surviving private hotels and guest houses. Many of the hotel owners were convicted by kangaroo courts under the pretext of having been engaged in economic crime or as agents working for the West. Their property was then confiscated and they were sent to prison. Many of the owners and small businessmen were incarcerated in Bützow prison. The hotels were supposed to have been expropriated by the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB). In fact, they were used as accommodation for the barracks-based &quot;people&#x27;s police&quot; ( or CPI). As a result of the confiscation of hotels, tourism on Rügen in 1953 came almost to a complete standstill for a time.

In the following nearly four decades, the island became one of the main tourist areas in the GDR. The FDGB played a dominant role in tourist accommodation. In 1963 the FDGB had 7,519 holiday places, the Reisebüro der DDR 2,906 places and a further 5,025 were available for businesses and organisations. In addition, there were 12,245 places for children in summer camps and another 20,800 places for campers. The plots were located mainly near the beaches. Increased holiday capacity was not however generated until the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Reunited Germany ===
In 1990, Rügen became part of the new state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and, together with the neighbouring islands of Hiddensee and Ummanz, formed the district of Rügen. Since the 2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern district reforms, Rügen has been part of Vorpommern-Rügen.

In 2007, a second bridge, the Rügen Bridge (), was built to replace the first one built in 1936.

Rügen has now surpassed Sylt as the most popular German island again.

== Tourist resorts ==
Rügen is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Germany. The island receives about one quarter of all overnight stays in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Most visitors come to Rügen between April and October, the peak season being from June to August, but its quiet atmosphere in winter is also appreciated.

The first bathing facility on Rügen opened in 1794 at the mineral-rich spring in Sagard. In 1818, the Putbus village of Lauterbach became Rügen&#x27;s first seaside resort. In the 1860s Sassnitz became a seaside resort, followed by Binz in the 1880s. During World War II Prora was constructed as a mass tourist resort but it was never finished.

Today the most popular seaside resorts are the Schaabe beaches between Altenkirchen and Juliusruh including Drewoldke, Glowe and Breege, and the eastern beaches between Sassnitz and Göhren including Neu Mukran, Prora, Binz, Sellin and Baabe. The latter are accessible via an historic narrow-gauge railway employing steam locomotives, called the Rügensche Bäderbahn. Tourist destinations, other than seaside resorts, include Cape Arkona, the wood-covered Stubbenkammer hills on Jasmund with interesting chalk cliff formations, the wood-covered Granitz hills with their or hunting lodge, the classicist buildings of Putbus and the inland villages of Bergen auf Rügen, Ralswiek and Gingst.

The island offers a huge variety of different beach and shore areas. Rügen is often visited by windsurfers and kitesurfers and offers more than fifteen different locations for surfing. The most popular locations are Dranske, Rosengarten, Wiek, Suhrendorf and Neu Mukran.

On the peninsula of Jasmund is the Jasmund National Park, which consists of the beech forest of Stubnitz, including the chalk cliffs of Rügen. On the Königsstuhl itself is the Königsstuhl National Park Centre, which has a multivision cinema and audio-guide exhibitions with information about the national park in several languages.

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===

The railway network consists of the electrified standard gauge stretch of the Deutsche Bahn Stralsund (Rügendamm)-Bergen-Sassnitz line (timetable route (KBS) 195), Lietzow-Binz (KBS 197), the non-electrified routes Bergen-Putbus-Lauterbach Mole of the PRESS (KBS 198) and the narrow-gauge stretch () of the Rügen Resort Railway (): Lauterbach Mole-Putbus-Binz-Sellin-Göhren (KBS 199).

In addition to regional trains, there are also Intercity services from Binz via Bergen and Stralsund to Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and the Ruhr. Night train services to Munich, Basle and the Ruhr area were deleted from the timetable on 9 December 2007, despite massive protests from the local hotel industry.

=== Bus ===
The bus service on Rügen is operated by the . Since 1996 it has been continuously expanded, and has developed an integral clock-face schedule. There is a service between all major towns and municipalities on the island at least every two hours, sometimes more frequently during peak season. Throughout the year, buses now run at least every hour on the routes between Sassnitz-Binz-Bergen, Schaprode–Bergen–Klein Zicker, Bergen/Sassnitz-Altenkirchen-Wiek-Dranske and the Altenkirchen-Putgarten near Cape Arkona. In addition, the bus service is well-linked with the railway, especially in Bergen, but also at other railway stations.

=== Road ===

Until October 2007, individual traffic from the mainland to the island of Rügen was mainly routed along the two-lane Rügendamm causeway, running between Stralsund and Altefähr over the sound of Strelasund.

The cornerstone for a second crossing over the Strelasund was laid on 31 August 2004. This bridge, the Rügen Bridge, running parallel to the Rügendamm, has a length of about and a vertical clearance for ships of , and was on opened on 20 October 2007. In order to relieve the town of Stralsund, a ring road has been built in the last few years, coming from the southwest. The B 96 federal road between Stralsund and Greifswald is also connected via an access road to the A 20 motorway. The B 96 runs from Stralsund via Bergen to Sassnitz. Here a new route with bypasses is planned (the &quot;New B 96&quot;).

The main tourist attractions of Cape Arkona, the Königsstuhl and the Granitz hunting lodge are, however, car-free in order to protect the countryside, as is the island of Hiddensee which belongs to Vorpommern-Rügen district. All these destinations can be reached using public transport, without needing a car.

=== Cycling ===
Rügen has a signposted network of cycle paths. The condition and signing of this network varies considerably from one place to another, from very good in the seaside resorts to poor in the area between Garz and Zudar. There is a circular cycle path around the whole island.
During the summer season there is the option on some routes to carry bicycles on the buses. This is always possible on the railways.

=== Ship ===
Two car ferries belonging to the operate every half-an-hour between the Zudar peninsula on Rügen and Stahlbrode on the mainland, halfway between Stralsund and Greifswald .

Another car ferry, the Wittow Ferry runs from the heartland of Rügen (&quot;Muttland&quot;) to Wittow.

A ferry sails from Sassnitz ferry port in Mukran to the Danish island of Bornholm, to Swedish Trelleborg, to Klaipėda (formerly Memel) in Lithuania, to Baltiysk (formerly Pillau) and to Saint Petersburg.

The island of Hiddensee, which also belongs to the county of Vorpommern-Rügen, is connected by a regular ferry service from Schaprode to Rügen, and is increasingly integrated into the clock-schedule timetable on the main island. In addition, there is a regular ship service from Stralsund, Wiek and Breege to Hiddensee. Tourist services include ferry connections from Lauterbach to Gager, and between Sassnitz, Binz, Sellin and Göhren. There are also round-trips mainly from Sassnitz, but also from Lohme, to the Königsstuhl.
Pleasure steamers also ply between the resorts and Peenemünde on Usedom, where there is a connection to the Usedom Railway (UBB).

=== Ferries ===
Sassnitz–Neu Mukran is the international ferry terminal on Rügen, with ferry services to
*Trelleborg (Sweden, served by Stena Line),
*Rønne (Bornholm, Denmark, served by Bornholmslinjen),
*Klaipėda (Memel, Lithuania, served by DFDS Lisco),
*Baltiysk (Pillau, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, served by DFDS Lisco),
*Saint Petersburg (Russia, served by &quot;TransRussiaExpress&quot;)
*Ust-Luga (near Saint Petersburg, Russia; planned).
Sassnitz-Mukran is the largest railway ferry terminal in Germany and the only one in Europe where different tracks allow switching from standard gauge to broad gauge.

Local passenger ferries connect the piers of Sassnitz, Binz, Sellin and Göhren with the adjacent islands of Hiddensee, Vilm and Greifswalder Oie. Passenger and car ferries connect Rügen&#x27;s centre of Muttland, to both Wittow in Rügen&#x27;s north via the Wittow Ferry and to the mainland via the Glewitz Ferry () between Stahlbrode near Greifswald and Glewitz on Rügen&#x27;s Zudar peninsula.

=== Aviation ===

Rügen Airport is located about from Bergen. After the &quot;Wende&quot;, the first sightseeing flights over the island were offered on the former agricultural airfield. In May 1993, the first tarmac runway was inaugurated. Since then, charter flights to Berlin, Hamburg and other cities in Europe have been available.

The Baltic Sea Airport Stralsund also offers flights to and from the region of Western Pomerania. The larger Rostock–Laage Airport offers regular international destinations.

<text>Khosrow I (also spelled Khosrau, Khusro or Chosroes; ), traditionally known by his epithet of Anushirvan (&quot;the Immortal Soul&quot;), was the Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 531 to 579. He was the son and successor of Kavad I ().

Inheriting a reinvigorated empire at war with the Byzantines, Khosrow I signed a peace treaty with them in 532, known as the Perpetual Peace, in which the Byzantine emperor Justinian I paid 11,000 pounds of gold to the Sasanians. Khosrow then focused on consolidating his power, executing conspirators, including his uncle Bawi. Dissatisfied with the actions of the Byzantine clients and vassals, the Ghassanids, and encouraged by Ostrogoth envoys from Italy, Khosrow violated the peace treaty and declared war against the Byzantines in 540. He sacked the major city of Antioch and deported its population to Persia. In 541, he invaded Lazica and made it an Iranian protectorate, thus initiating the Lazic War. In 545, the two empires agreed to halt the wars in Mesopotamia and Syria while continuing to fight in Lazica. A truce was made in 557, and by 562 a Fifty-Year Peace Treaty was made.

In 572, Justin II, the successor of Justinian, broke the peace treaty and sent a Byzantine force into the Sasanian region of Arzanene. The following year, Khosrow besieged and captured the important Byzantine fortress-city of Dara, which led Justin II to insanity. The war lasted until 591, outliving Khosrow. Khosrow&#x27;s wars were not only based in the west. To the east, in an alliance with the Göktürks, he finally put an end to the Hephthalite Empire, which had inflicted a handful of defeats on the Sasanians in the 5th century, killing Khosrow&#x27;s grandfather Peroz I. To the south, Iranian forces led by Wahrez defeated the Aksumites and conquered Yemen.

Khosrow I was known for his character, virtues and knowledge. During his ambitious reign, he continued his father&#x27;s project of making major social, military, and economic reforms, promoting the welfare of the people, increasing state revenues, establishing a professional army, and founding or rebuilding many cities, palaces, and much infrastructure. He was interested in literature and philosophy, and under his reign, art and science flourished in Iran. He was the most distinguished of the Sasanian kings, and his name became a royal title, like that of Caesar in the history of Rome.

At the time of his death, the Sasanian Empire had reached its greatest extent since Shapur II, stretching from Yemen in the west to Gandhara in the east. He was succeeded by his son Hormizd IV.

== Name and titles ==
 is the New Persian variant of his name used by scholars; his original name was Middle Persian, , itself derived from Avestan (&quot;he who has good fame&quot;). The name is rendered in Greek as () and in Arabic as &quot;Kisra&quot;. Besides his personal name, he is widely known in sources by his epithet of (&quot;the Immortal Soul&quot;), a New Persian rendering of Middle Persian . He received this title after his death to distinguish him from Khosrow II. It referred to his religious reforms and promotion of the prosperity of the realm and probably also connected him with the mythical immortal king Kay Khosrow (both were remembered as pious kings and &quot;restorers&quot; of the faith). Other variants of the name are , &quot;Anushiravan&quot; and . Khosrow was also known by the epithets (&quot;Dispenser of Justice&quot;) and, in Islamic times, &quot;&#x27;Adel&quot; (&quot;the Just&quot;).

== Historiography ==
Many sources dating to the Islamic era, such as al-Tabari&#x27;s Arabic &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot; and the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;) of the medieval Persian epic of Ferdowsi (d. 1020), give much information regarding Khosrow&#x27;s reforms, and thus most likely drew both of their information from the Middle Persian history book &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; (&quot;Book of Lords&quot;). Other works were made independently, such as the &quot;Sirat Anushirwan&quot;, which was reportedly an autobiography made by Khosrow himself, and survives in the work of Miskawayh (932–1030). Khosrow is also mentioned in several Greek sources, such as the ones of Procopius, Agathias and Menander Protector, who all give important information regarding Khosrow&#x27;s management of the Irano-Roman wars. Syriac authors, such as John of Ephesus and Zacharias Rhetor also include Khosrow in their work, offering a perception of the consequences that his expeditions brought on the people who lived on the Roman border.

== Background ==

Khosrow I was reportedly born between 512 and 514 at Ardestan, a town located in the Spahan province in central Iran. The town, dating back to the Achaemenid period, thrived during Khosrow&#x27;s age, and also included a fire temple, which was said to be founded by the mythological Kayanian king Kay Bahman, from whom the Sasanians claimed their descent. Khosrow was the youngest son of Kavad I, the ruling Sasanian shah. His mother was an Ispahbudhan princess, who was the sister of the leading Iranian general Bawi. The Ispahbudhan were one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran that formed the elite aristocracy of the Sasanian Empire. They in particular enjoyed such a high status that they were acknowledged as &quot;kin and partners of the Sasanians&quot;. The family also held the important position of &quot;spahbed&quot; of the West, i.e. the Sasanian Empire&#x27;s southwestern regions (Khwarwaran).

Following the tradition of the aristocratic or upper-class families, Khosrow would have started at school (&quot;frahangestān&quot;) between the age of five and seven. There he would learn to write and would learn the &quot;yashts&quot;, &quot;Hadokht&quot;, &quot;Bayān Yasn&quot; and &quot;Vendidad&quot;, following the same pattern of schooling made for a future priest (&quot;herbed&quot;). Furthermore, he would observe the Middle Persian translation of the Avesta, the Zend. Afterwards, he would be schooled in riding, archery, polo (&quot;chovgan&quot;) and military creativity.

== Early life ==
===Negotiations with the Byzantines over the adoption of Khosrow===

In , Kavad, in order to secure the succession of Khosrow, whose position was threatened by rival brothers and the Mazdakite sect, proposed that Emperor Justin I adopt him. The proposal was initially greeted with enthusiasm by the Byzantine Emperor and his nephew, Justinian, but Justin&#x27;s &quot;quaestor&quot;, Proclus, opposed the move, due to the concern of Khosrow possibly later try to take over the Byzantine throne. The Byzantines instead made a counter-proposal to adopt Khosrow not as a Roman, but a barbarian. In the end the negotiations did not come to a consensus. Khosrow reportedly felt insulted by the Byzantines, and his attitude deteriorated towards them.

Mahbod, who had along with Siyawush acted as the diplomats of the negotiations, accused the latter of purposely sabotaging the negotiations. Further accusations were made towards Siyawush, which included the reverence of new deities and having his dead wife buried, which was a violation of Iranian laws. Siyawush was thus most likely a Mazdakite, the religious sect that Kavad originally supported but now had withdrawn his support from. Although Siyawush was a close friend of Kavad and had helped him escape from imprisonment, the latter did not try to prevent his execution, seemingly with the purpose of restricting Siyawush&#x27;s immense authority as the head of the Sasanian army, a post which was disliked by the other nobles. Siyawush was executed, and his office was abolished. Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, it was not until 530 that full-scale warfare on the main eastern frontier broke out. In the intervening years, the two sides preferred to wage war by proxy, through Arab allies in the south and Huns in the north.

===Persecution of Mazdak and his followers===

Mazdak was the name of a chief representative of a religious and philosophical teaching called Mazdakism, which opposed violence, and called for the sharing of wealth, women and property, an archaic form of communism. Mazdakism not only consisted of theological and cosmological aspects, but also political and social impacts, which was to the disadvantage of the nobility and clergy. According to modern historians Touraj Daryaee and Matthew Canepa, sharing women was most likely an overstatement and defamation deriving from Mazdak&#x27;s decree that loosened marriage rules to help the lower classes. Powerful families saw this as a tactic to weaken their lineage and advantages, which was most likely the case. Kavad used the movement as a political tool to curb the power of the nobility and clergy. With the nobility and clergy weakened, Kavad was able to make reforms with less difficulty. With the reforms roaring by the 520s, he no longer had any use for Mazdak. As a result, he officially withdrew his support from the Mazdakites. A debate was arranged, where not only the Zoroastrian priesthood, but also the Christian and Jewish ones slandered Mazdak and his followers.

According to the Shahnameh (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;), written several centuries later by the medieval Persian poet Ferdowsi, Kavad had Mazdak and his supporters sent to Khosrow, who had his supporters killed by burying their heads in a walled orchard, with only their feet being visible. Khosrow then summoned Mazdak to look at his garden, saying the following; &quot;You will find trees there that no-one has ever seen and no-one ever heard of even from the mouth of the ancient sages.&quot; Mazdak, seeing his followers corpses, screamed and passed out. He was afterwards executed by Khosrow, who had his feet fastened on a gallows, and had his men shoot arrows at him. The validity of the story is uncertain; Ferdowsi used much earlier reports of events to write the Shahnameh, and thus the story may report some form of contemporary memory.

== Accession ==
=== The Eternal Peace of 532 ===

In 531, while the Iranian army was besieging Martyropolis, Kavad became ill and died. Khosrow succeeded him, but due to his domestic position being insecure, he wanted to make peace with the Byzantines, who themselves under Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) were perhaps already more focused on recovering the lost western half of the Roman Empire than in pursuing war against Iran. The Byzantine envoys Rufinus, Hermogenes, Alexander and Thomas found Khosrow in a more conciliatory disposition than his father, and an agreement was soon reached. Justinian would pay 110 &quot;centenaria&quot; (11,000 pounds) of gold, ostensibly as a contribution to the defence of the Caucasus passes against the barbarians living beyond, and the base of the &quot;dux Mesopotamiae&quot; would be withdrawn from the fortress of Dara to the city of Constantina. The two rulers would recognize once again each other as equal and pledged mutual assistance. Khosrow initially refused to hand back the two Lazic forts, while demanding the return of the two other forts the Byzantines had captured in Sasanian Armenia. Justinian at first agreed, but soon changed his mind, causing the agreement to be broken off. In summer 532, however, a new embassy by Hermogenes and Rufinus managed to persuade Khosrow for a full exchange of the occupied forts, as well as for allowing the exiled Iberian rebels to either remain in the Byzantine Empire or return safely to their homes.

=== Consolidation of power ===
Sometime during the early reign of Khosrow, he had to deal with his eldest brother Kawus, who ruled as governor-king of the northern province of Padishkhwargar. Unlike Khosrow, he was a Mazdakite (or at least had strong Mazdakite sympathies), and thus had their support as the candidate for the throne. Kawus asserted to be the legitimate heir of the throne due to his older age. He was, however, defeated by Khosrow&#x27;s forces and taken to Ctesiphon, where Khosrow summoned the priests and urged Kawus to make confessions and ask for forgiveness, so that he could be released. Kawus refused, preferring death, forcing Khosrow to have him killed. Khosrow reportedly &quot;cursed the fortunes&quot; for &quot;forcing him to kill a brother like Kawus.&quot;

Another danger to Khosrow&#x27;s rule was that of his uncle Bawi, who along with other members of the Iranian aristocracy, became involved in a conspiracy in which they tried to overthrow Khosrow and make Kavad, the son of Khosrow&#x27;s brother Jamasp, the shah of Iran. Upon learning of the plot, Khosrow executed all his brothers and their offspring, along with Bawi and the other aristocrats who were involved. Khosrow also ordered the execution of Kavad, who was still a child, and was away from the court, being raised by Adergoudounbades. Khosrow sent orders to kill Kavad, but Adergoudounbades disobeyed and brought him up in secret, until he was betrayed to the shah in 541 by his own son, Bahram. Khosrow had him executed, but Kavad, or someone claiming to be him, managed to flee to the Byzantine Empire.

==Reforms==

===Summary===
Khosrow I represents the epitome of the philosopher king in the Sasanian Empire. Upon his ascent to the throne, Khosrow did not restore power to the feudal nobility or the magi, but centralized his government. Khosrow&#x27;s reign is considered to be one of the most successful within the Sasanian Empire. The peace agreement between Rome and Iran in 531 gave Khosrow the chance to consolidate power and focus his attention on internal improvement. His reforms and military campaigns marked a renaissance of the Sasanian Empire, which spread philosophic beliefs as well as trade goods from the far east to the far west.

The internal reforms under Khosrow were much more important than those on the exterior frontier. The subsequent reforms resulted in the rise of a bureaucratic state at the expense of the great noble families, strengthening the central government and the power of the Shahanshah. The army too was reorganized and tied to the central government rather than local nobility allowing greater organization, faster mobilization and a far greater cavalry corps. Reforms in taxation provided the empire with stability and a much stronger economy, allowing prolonged military campaigns as well as greater revenues for the bureaucracy.

====Tax reforms====
Khosrow&#x27;s tax reforms have been praised by several scholars, the most notable of whom is F. Altheim. The tax reforms, which were started under Kavad I and completely implemented by Khosrow, greatly strengthened the royal court. Prior to Khosrow and Kavad&#x27;s reigns, a majority of the land was owned by seven Parthian families: Suren, Waraz, Karen, Ispahbudhan, Spandiyadh, Mihran and Zik. These great landowners enjoyed tax exemptions from the Sasanian empire, and were tax collectors within their local provincial areas.

With the outbreak of the Mazdakite revolution, there was a great uprising of peasants and lower-class citizens who grabbed large portions of land under egalitarian values. As a result of this there was great confusion on land possession and ownership. Khosrow surveyed all the land within the empire indiscriminately and began to tax all land under a single program. Tax revenues that previously went to the local noble family now went to the central government treasury. The fixed tax that Khosrow implemented created a more stable form of income for the treasury.

Because the tax did not vary, the treasury could easily estimate the year&#x27;s revenue. Prior to Khosrow&#x27;s tax reforms, taxes were collected based on the yield that the land had produced. The new system calculated and averaged taxation based on the water rights for each piece of property. Lands which grew date palms and olive trees used a slightly different method of taxation based on the amount of producing trees that the land contained. These tax reforms of Khosrow were the stepping stone which enabled subsequent reforms in the bureaucracy and the military to take place.

====Administrative reforms====
The hallmark of Khosrow&#x27;s bureaucratic reform was the creation of a new social class. Before, the Sasanian Empire consisted of only three social classes, magi, nobles and peasants/commoners. Khosrow added a fourth class to this hierarchy between the nobles and the peasants, called the dehqans. The dehqans were small land owning citizens of the Sasanian Empire and were considered lower nobility.

Khosrow promoted honest government officials based on trust and honesty, rather than corrupt nobles and magi. The small landowning deghans were favored over the high nobles because they tended to be more trustworthy and owed their loyalty to the Shah for their position in the bureaucracy. The rise of deghans became the backbone of the empire because they now held the majority of land and positions in local and provincial administration.

The reduction of power of the great families improved the empire. This was because previously, each great family ruled a large chunk of land and had their own king. The name Shahanshah, meaning King of Kings, derived from the fact that there were many feudal kings in Sasanian Iran with the Shahanshah as the ruler of them all. Their fall meant their power was redirected to the central government and all taxes now went to the central government rather than to the local nobility.

===Military reforms===

Major reforms to the military made the Iranian army capable of fighting sustained wars, battling on multiple fronts, and deploy itself faster. Prior to Khosrow&#x27;s reign, much like other aspects of the empire, the military was dependent on the feudal lords of the great families to provide soldiers and cavalry. Each family would provide their own army and equipment when called by the Shahanshah. This system was replaced with the emergence of the lower deghan nobility class, who was paid and provided by the central government.

The main force of the Sasanian army was the Aswaran cavalry. Previously only nobles could enlist into the Aswaran cavalry which was very limited and created shortages in well trained soldiers. Now that the dehqan class was considered nobility, they were able to join the cavalry force and boosted the number of cavalry force significantly.

The military reform focused more on organization and training of troops. The cavalry was still the most important aspect of the Iranian military, with foot archers being less important, and mass peasant forces being on the bottom of the spectrum.

Khosrow made four military districts with a &quot;spahbed&quot;, or general, in charge of each district. Before the reforms of Khosrow, the general of the Iranians (&quot;Eran-spahbed&quot;) controlled the military of the entire empire. The four zones consisted of Mesopotamia in the west, the Caucasus region in the north, the Persian Gulf in the central and southwest region, and Central Asia in the east. This new quadripartition of the Empire not only created a more efficient military system but also &quot;[administration] of a vast, multiregional, multicultural, and multiracial empire&quot;.

====Equipment====
During Khosrow&#x27;s reign, a &quot;list&quot; for equipment for the cavalry (&quot;aswaran&quot;) was written. The list comprised a helmet, a gorget, a chain mail shirt, a lamellar coat or cuirass, leg armour, gauntlets, sword, shield, two bows with spare strings, 30 arrows, axe or mace, and horse armour.

Sasanian bullae showing the four spahbeds show that horses were still fully armoured during this period and heavy cavalry tactics were still used by the Sasanian cavalry. It is highly likely that the stirrup had been introduced to the Sasanian cavalry two centuries before Khosrow&#x27;s reforms (and are mentioned in Bivar (1972)), and a &quot;stirrupped&quot; foot position can be seen on the Sasanian bullae and at Taq-e-Bostan.

==Military campaigns==

===War with the Byzantine Empire, 540–562===

====Background====
In 539 Khosrow had originally attempted to gain a &quot;casus belli&quot; against the Byzantines by trying to take advantage of a disagreement between his Lakhmid clients and the Byzantine clients Ghassanids, who both claimed ownership of the lands south of Palmyra, near the old &quot;Strata Diocletiana&quot;. His attempt was, however, thwarted when the Byzantines successfully equivocated the problem. Subsequently, Khosrow accused Justinian of trying to bribe the Lakhmid ruler al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu&#x27;man () through his diplomat Summus, and also that he had emboldened some Huns to make incursions into Iran. The Ghassanid ruler al-Harith ibn Jabalah () invaded Mundhir&#x27;s territory and carried off rich booty. Khosrow complained to Justinian about this incident, and requested that the stolen riches be returned to him, including payment for the Arabs that had been killed during the attack. His request was, however, ignored. This incident, along with the support by an emissary from the Ostrogoth king Vitiges, and the Armenians living in Byzantine territory being dissatisfied with their rule, encouraged Khosrow to renew the war against the Byzantines. Justinian&#x27;s ceaseless wars in North Africa and Italy must have contributed to Khosrow&#x27;s aspirations as well. Justinian, informed of Khosrow&#x27;s intention for war, tried to dissuade him, but to no avail.

====Sasanian invasion of Syria====
In May 540, Khosrow invaded the domains of the Byzantines; he avoided the fortress of Circesium, and instead approached Zenobia, where he made a lukewarm attempt to persuade the fortress to surrender, which proved unsuccessful. He then proceeded to Sura and killed its commander Arsaces in battle. Demoralized by the death of their commander, the residents sent their bishop to parley with Khosrow. Feigning to accept the plea of the bishop, Khosrow took advantage of the occasion and captured the city, which was shortly sacked. Germanus, the cousin of Justinian, sent the bishop of Beroea, Megas, to negotiate with Khosrow. Regardless, Khosrow continued his expedition, threatening the city of Hierapolis, whose custodians swiftly paid him of silver to leave the city untouched. After receiving additional pleas by Megas, Khosrow agreed to end his expedition in return for ten &quot;centenaria&quot;. While Megas went back to Antioch to inform Germanus of Khosrow&#x27;s demands, the latter approached Beroea, which he had sacked. In June, Khosrow reached Antioch, where he offered its citizens to not attack the city in return for ten &quot;centenaria&quot;. His offer was rejected, and as a result he captured and sacked the city.

Justinian sued for peace, and made a treaty with Khosrow that the Iranians would withdraw back to their domains in return for a payment of 50 &quot;centenaria&quot; plus 5 &quot;centenaria&quot; extra each year. Part of treaty also included that the Byzantine envoys were to be hostages of Khosrow as an assurance that the Byzantines would honor the agreement. However, before departing, Khosrow went to the port of Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, where he bathed in the Mediterranean Sea. He then told the envoys that he wished to visit the city of Apamea out of interest, which they reluctantly allowed him, with the condition that he would leave for his domains afterwards. There he held chariot races, where he made the Blue Faction—which was supported by Justinian—lose against the rival Greens. Khosrow extracted tribute from Apamea and other Byzantine towns, at which point Justinian called off his truce and prepared to send his commander Belisarius to move against the Sasanians.

====Lazic War====

In spring 541, Khosrow brought his army north to Lazica on request of the Lazic king Gubazes II to repel the Byzantines from his territory. The fortress of Petra was afterwards captured by Khosrow&#x27;s forces, and a protectorate was established over the country. At the same time, Belisarius arrived in Mesopotamia and began besieging the city of Nisibis. Although Belisarius had greatly outnumbered the city garrison, the city was too well fortified and he was forced to ravage the country around the Nisibis, subsequently getting recalled back west. After successful campaigns in Armenia, Khosrow was encouraged once again to attack Syria. Khosrow turned south towards Edessa and besieged the city. Edessa was now a much more important city than Antioch was, and the garrison which occupied the city was able to resist the siege. The Iranians were forced to retreat from Edessa, but were able to forge a five-year truce with the Byzantine Empire in 545. Three years into the five-year truce (548), rebellion against Sasanian control broke out in Lazica. In response, a Byzantine army was sent to support the people of Lazica, effectively ending the established truce and thus continuing the Lazic Wars.

Sometime later, Khosrow, who was keen to wrest Dara from Byzantine control, and would do so even if he risked to break the truce they had made regarding Mesopotamia, tried to capture it by tricking them; he sent one of highest officials, Izadgushasp, as a diplomat to Constantinople, but in reality the latter would stop by Dara, and with the aid of his large crew, he would seize the city. However, this plan was prevented by a former adviser of Belisarius named George, who demanded that if Izadgushasp should enter the city he should have only twenty members of his crew with him. Izadgushasp then left the city and continued his journey to Constantinople, where he was amicably welcomed by Justinian, who gave him some gifts.

In 549 the previous truce between Justinian and Khosrow was disregarded and full war broke out once again between Iranians and Romans. The last major decisive battle of the Lazic wars came in 556 when Byzantine general Martin defeated a massive Sasanian force led by an Iranian &quot;nakhvaegan&quot; (field marshal). Negotiations between Khosrow and Justinian opened in 556, leading to the Fifty-Year Peace Treaty in 562 in which Iranians would leave Lazica in return for an annual payment of gold.

According to ancient historian Menander Protector, a minor official in Justinian&#x27;s court, there were 12 points to the treaty, stated in the following passage:

===War in the East===

With a stable peace agreement with the Byzantines in the west, Khosrow was now able to focus his attention on the eastern Hephthalites and end their domination over Central Asia. Even with the growth of Iranian military power under Khosrow&#x27;s reforms, the Sasanians were still uneasy at the prospect of attacking the Hephthalite on their own and began to seek allies. Their answer came in the form of Turkic incursions into Central Asia. The movement of Turkic people into Central Asia very quickly made them natural enemies and competitors to the Hephthalites.

The Hephthalites were a strong military power but they lacked the organization to fight on multiple fronts. The Sasanians and the First Turkic Khaganate made an alliance and in 557 launched a two pronged attack on the Hephthalites, taking advantage of their disorganization and disunity. The Hephthalite Empire was destroyed after the battle of Gol-Zarriun, and broke into several minor kingdoms around the Oxus. The Hephthalite king Ghadfar and what was left of his men fled southward to Sasanian territory, where they took refuge. Meanwhile, the Turkic Khagan Sinjibu reached an agreement with the Hephthalite nobility, and appointed Faghanish, the ruler of Chaghaniyan, as the new Hephthalite king.
This was much to the dislike of Khosrow, who considered the Turkic collaboration with the Hephthalites to pose a danger for his rule in the east, and thus marched towards the Sasanian-Turkic border in Gurgan. When he reached the place, he was met by a Turkic delegate of Sinjibu that presented him gifts. There Khosrow asserted his authority and military potency, and persuaded the Turks to make an alliance with him. The alliance contained a treaty that made it obligatory for Faghanish to be sent to the Sasanian court in Ctesiphon and gain the approval of Khosrow for his status as Hephthalite king. Faghanish and his kingdom of Chaghaniyan thus became a vassal of the Sasanian Empire, which set the Oxus as the eastern frontier the Sasanians and Turks. However, friendly relations between Turks and Sasanians quickly deteriorated after that. Both Turks and Iranians wanted to dominate the Silk Road and the trade industry between the west and the far east. In 562 Khosrow II defeated the Hephthalites once again, and then stopped the threat of the Turks.

In 568 a Turkic embassy was sent to Byzantine to propose an alliance and two pronged attack on the Sasanian Empire. Fortunately for the Sasanians, nothing ever came from this proposal. Later in 569/570, Sinjibu attacked and pillaged Sasanian border lands, but a treaty was soon signed. Khosrow then sent a Mihranid named Mihransitad, to estimate the quality of the daughter of the Turkic Khagan. According to Armenian sources her name was Kayen, while Persian sources states that her name was Qaqim-khaqan. After Mihransitad&#x27;s visit in Central Asia, Khosrow married Qaqim-khaqan. According to some sources, Hormizd IV, the successor of Khosrow, was the son of the Turkic princess. However, &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; states that the &quot;marriage with the daughter of the Turkic khaqan is chronologically impossible&quot;, and says that Hormizd was born in 540, thirty years before Khosrow&#x27;s marriage.

===Campaign in Yemen against Abyssinia===

In 522, before Khosrow&#x27;s reign, a group of miaphysite Ethiopians led an attack on the dominant Himyarites of southern Arabia. The local Arab leader blunted the attack, and appealed to the Sasanians for aid, while the Ethiopians subsequently turned towards the Byzantines for help. The Ethiopians sent another force across the Red Sea, killed the Arab leader, and crowned an Ethiopian king of the region.

In 531, Justinian suggested that the Ethiopians of Yemen end the Sasanians maritime trade with the Indians. The Ethiopians never met this request because an Ethiopian general named Abraha took control of the Yemenite throne and created an independent nation. After Abraha&#x27;s death one of his sons, Ma&#x27;d-Karib, went into exile while his half-brother took the throne. After being denied by Justinian, Ma&#x27;d-Karib sought help from Khosrow, who sent a small fleet and army under commander Vahrez to depose the current king of Yemen. After capturing the capital city San&#x27;a&#x27;l, Ma&#x27;d-Karib&#x27;s son, Saif enthroned.

Justinian was ultimately responsible for Sasanian maritime presence in Yemen. By not providing the Yemenite Arabs support, Khosrow was able to help Ma&#x27;d-Karib and subsequently established Yemen as a principality of the Sasanian Empire.

===War with the Byzantine Empire, 572–591===
Justinian died in 565 and left Justin II to succeed the throne. In 555, the Sasanian governor of Armenia and a relative of Khosrow, Chihor-Vishnasp (also known as Suren), built a fire temple at the Armenian capital Dvin and put to death a popular and influential member of the Mamikonian family. This execution created tremendous civil unrest and led to a revolt and massacre of the governor including the capture of Dvin in 572. Justin II took advantage of this revolt and used it as an excuse to stop paying annual payments to Khosrow, effectively putting an end to the 51 year peace treaty that was established ten years earlier. Khosrow, who tried to avoid another war, sent a Christian diplomat named Sebokht to Constantinople in order to try to persuade Justin to change his mind. Justin, however, refused to listen to the diplomat, and prepared to help the Armenians, whom he considered his allies, in their war against Khosrow. A Byzantine army was sent into Sasanian territory and besieged Nisibis in the same year.

Meanwhile, Khosrow sent an army under Golon Mihran to Armenia, but the latter was defeated in Taron by the Armenian rebel leader Vardan III Mamikonian, who captured his war elephants as war booty. Sometime later, however, Golon Mihran managed to seize Angl. During the same time, the Siunian prince Vahan asked for Khosrow&#x27;s permission that he could move his court from Dvin to the capital of Paytakaran, a region in eastern Armenia. Furthermore, Vahan also requested that Paytakaran should be merged with the Adurbadagan province. Khosrow accepted, and did what he asked.

In 573, Khosrow sent an army under Adarmahan to invade Syria, while he himself along with the three Mihranid military officers Izadgushasp, Fariburz and Bahram Chobin led an army towards Dara, where they captured the city after four months, while Adarmahan sacked several cities in Syria, which included Apamea. Justin reportedly lost his mind after these Byzantine disasters, and abdicated.

He was succeeded by Tiberius, a high-ranking military officer in 578. Khosrow invaded Armenia once again feeling that he had the upper hand, and was initially successful. Soon after, the tables turned and the Byzantines gained a lot of local support. This made the Sasanians attempt another truce. However, sometime later, Khosrow, with an army consisting of 12,000 Iranian soldiers including a combined of Sabir-Arab soldiers numbering 8,000 sent by his allies, ravaged the places around Resaina and Constantia in Syria, thus turning the tables once more. During the same time, one of Khosrow&#x27;s chief generals, Tamkhosrau, managed to trick Maurice by faking an invasion of Theodosiopolis, and then plundered the countryside of Martyropolis and Amida.

However, the tables of the war quickly turned again when the newly appointed Byzantine supreme-commander Maurice entered the field and captured many Sasanian settlements. The revolt came to an end when Khosrow gave amnesty to Armenia and brought them back into the Sasanian empire. Peace negotiations were once again brought back up, but abruptly ended with the death of Khosrow in 579, who was succeeded by his son Hormizd IV.

== Religious policy ==

Khosrow, like all other Sasanian rulers, was an adherent of Zoroastrianism. Since the 5th century, the Sasanian monarchs had been made aware of the significance of the religious minorities in the realm, and as a result tried to homogenize them into a structure of administration where according to legal principles, all would be treated straightforwardly as &quot;mard / zan ī šahr&quot;, i.e. &quot;man/woman citizen (of the Empire).&quot; Jews and notably Christians had accepted the concept of Iran and considered themselves part of the nation. By the time of Khosrow, the leader of the Church of the East had the title of &quot;Catholicos of Iran&quot; (&quot;Ērān Cathollicos&quot;).

Sasanian monarchs only persecuted other religions when it was in their urgent political interests to do. This also applied to Khosrow, who, in the words of Eberhard Sauer, had to &quot;walk a fine line&quot;. Khosrow himself used the church considerably, and was fond of its Patriarch, Aba I, whom he wanted to defend against the Zoroastrian priests. Nevertheless, Aba was accused of working with the Byzantines, which was a serious allegation due to the war that had begun in 540. Consequently, in 542, Aba was dismissed from his post, but was only exiled instead of being executed.

Khosrow even enjoyed good relations with Gregory, the Mihranid commander of the Iranian troops in the Caucasus, who had showily disowned Zoroastrianism in front of other troops massed at a feast in 518. This resulted in discontent amongst members of the court, who pressured Khosrow to deal with an apostate from such a powerful and influential family, stating that &quot;It is a great dishonor for the religion of the Magians that such a great man from the lineage of the house of Mihran, who have always been servants of Ohrmazd, now becomes a servant of Christ.&quot; Khosrow was thus forced to have Gregory relieved and incarcerated, yet the Mihranids deemed Khosrow&#x27;s choice insufficient. A son of Gregory&#x27;s paternal uncle, Mihran, asked Khosrow to execute Gregory for &quot;bringing dishonor to our lineage&quot;. The latter was in a good position to make such request, due to recently having defeated the Hephthalites in the east; Gregory was eventually executed.

Khosrow did however deal harshly and swiftly with people with of any belief or practice that ran contrary to Sasanian-mediated Zoroastrian orthodoxy. Aberrance in ceremony and principle exceeded apostasy as &quot;a social and political evil in undermining the foundations of the imperial religion (Payne).&quot; According to Khosrow&#x27;s supposed autobiographical work of &quot;Sirat Anushirwan&quot;, he had a party of nobles practicing unorthodoxy executed instantly when he found out about them. According to the book, Khosrow also had another group−supposedly Manichaeans−banished from Iran. This was due to the royal anxieties regarding the chance of religious rogues to upset the political structure, which had recently occurred during Kavad and Khosrow&#x27;s reigns by the Mazdakites.

== Constructions ==

Khosrow is known to have ordered many public works projects during his long reign, such bridges, roads, dams and walls. To protect the frontiers of Iran, Khosrow had a sequence of walls built (and fortified) around his empire, much like the Great Wall of China and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in Northern England. Instead of constructing it on one side of the empire, he had it on four. According to Middle Persian sources, Khosrow I ordered the construction of the Great Wall of Gorgan, which extended from the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea to block incursions by nomadic tribes, such as the Hephthalites. In the northwest, he had the Derbent Wall further fortified to protect the area from incursions by Alans, Turks, Sarirs, Khazars, and other northern neighbours.

Another wall was constructed in the southwest, called the &quot;war-i tāzigān&quot; (&quot;wall of the Arabs&quot;). He may have also built another wall in the northeast−the Wall of Tammisha. Besides defense structures, Khosrow also had a large-scale canal system created in Asoristan, known in Islamic sources as the Nahrawan Canal. Out of all his constructions, his most memorable and noteworthy achievement was the palace he had made at Ctesiphon, known as the Taq-e Kasra. The palace, still standing to this day, albeit heavily ruined, portrays one of the empire&#x27;s most remarkable architectural accomplishments.

After the sack of Antioch in 540, Khosrow built a new city one &quot;parasang&quot; () south of Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he had captured. It was located on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and was officially named &quot;Weh-andīōg-husraw&quot; (&quot;City Better than Antioch [has] Khosrow [built this]&quot; or &quot;Khosrow&#x27;s Better Antioch&quot;). The city reportedly had public baths and a hippodrome, and a street program modelled on Antioch. The Christian population was granted freedom of religion and burial. The city was known informally as Rumagan (&quot;Town of the Greeks&quot;), which later became ar-Rumiyya under the Caliphate. The remains of the city are most likely situated at the unexcavated place that is still known as Bustan Kisra (&quot;Gardens of Khosrow&quot;).
== Coinage ==

The Sassanian revival took place under his rule, so Khosrow minted such inscriptions on his especial issue coinage as &quot;Iranians have become fearless&quot; (&quot;ērān abē-bēm kard&quot;), and &quot;Iranians became strong&quot; (&quot;ērān abzonhēnēd&quot;).

==Philosopher King==

Khosrow I was admired, both in Iran and elsewhere, for his character, virtues, and knowledge of Greek philosophy. He was identified by some Romans as the true philosopher king.

Khosrow I was known to be a great patron of philosophy and knowledge. An entry in the Chronicle of Séert reads: Khosrow I is known for saying a philosophic quote that follows: 

Khosrow I accepted refugees coming from the Eastern Roman Empire when Justinian closed the neo-Platonist schools in Athens in 529. He was greatly interested in Indian philosophy, science, mathematics, and medicine. He sent multiple embassies and gifts to the Indian court and requested them to send back philosophers to teach in his court in return. Khosrow made many translations of texts from Greek, Sanskrit, and Syriac into Middle Persian. He received the title of &quot;Plato&#x27;s Philosopher King&quot; by the Greek refugees that he allowed into his empire because of his great interest in Platonic philosophy. Nöldeke states that Khosrow I was &quot;certainly one of the most efficient and best kings that the Iranians have ever had&quot;.

A synthesis of Greek, Iranian, Indian, and Armenian learning traditions took place within the Sasanian Empire. One outcome of this synthesis created what is known as &quot;bimaristan&quot;, the first hospital that introduced a concept of segregating wards according to pathology. Greek pharmacology fused with Iranian and Indian traditions resulted in significant advances in medicine. According to historian Richard Frye, this great influx of knowledge created a renaissance during and after Khosrow&#x27;s reign.
Intellectual games such as chess and backgammon demonstrated and celebrated the diplomatic relationship between Khosrow and a &quot;great king of India.&quot; The vizier of the Indian king invented chess as a cheerful, playful challenge to King Khosrow. It seems that the Indian ruler who sent the game of chess to Khosrow was the Maukhari King Śarvavarman of Kannauj, between the beginning of Śarvavarman&#x27;s reign in 560/565 and the end of Khosrow&#x27;s reign in 579. When the game was sent to Iran it came with a letter which read: &quot;As your name is the King of Kings, all your emperorship over us connotes that your wise men should be wiser than ours. Either you send us an explanation of this game of chess or send revenue and tribute us.&quot; Khosrow&#x27;s grand vizier successfully solved the riddle and figured out how to play chess. In response the wise vizier created the game backgammon and sent it to the Indian court with the same message. The Indian king was not able to solve the riddle and was forced to pay tribute.

===Academy of Gondishapur===

Khosrow I is known to have greatly expanded the Academy of Gondishapur, located in the city of Gundeshapur. As to the development of non-religious knowledge and research in Iran and apart from historical evidence given on such traditions in the preceding Iranian Empires, there are reports on systematic activities initiated by the Sasanian court as early as in the first decades of Sasanian rule. The Middle Persian compendium &quot;Denkard&quot; states that during the reign of Shapur I writings of this kind were collected and added to the Avesta. And an atmosphere of vivid reflection and discussion at the early Sasanian court in the third century AD is reflected in such accounts.
The foundation of the Academy of Gondishapur introduced the studies of philosophy, medicine, physics, poetry, rhetoric, and astronomy into the Sasanian court. According to some historical accounts, this famous learning center was built in order to provide a place for incoming Greek refugees to study and share their knowledge. Gundeshapur became the focal point of the combination of Greek and Indian sciences along with Iranian and Syriac traditions. The cosmopolitan which was introduced by the institution of Gondishapur became a catalyst for modern studies.

==Legacy==

Although Khosrow&#x27;s achievements were highly successful and helped centralize the empire, they did not last long after his death. The local officials and great noble families resented the fact that their power had been stripped away from them and began to quickly regain power after his death. Khosrow&#x27;s reign had a major impact on Islamic culture and political life. Many of his policies and reforms were brought into the Islamic nation in their transformation from a decentralized confederation into a centralized empire.

There are a considerable number of Islamic works that were inspired by the reign of Khosrow I, for example the &quot;Kitab al-Taj&quot; of Jahiz. The high number of Islamic texts referring to Khosrow&#x27;s reign can make it hard to distinguish fact from fallacy.

During his reign the Silk Road between ancient China, India and the western world was promoted and possibly even created. Richard Frye argues that Khosrow&#x27;s rationale behind his numerous wars with the Byzantine empire as well as the eastern Hephthalites was to establish the Sasanian dominance on this trade route.

<text>Essential Logic are an English post-punk band formed in 1978 by saxophonist Lora Logic after leaving X-Ray Spex. The band initially consisted of Lora on vocals, Phil Legg on guitar and vocals, William Bennett (later of Whitehouse) on guitar, Mark Turner on bass guitar, Rich Tea (Richard Thompson) on drums and Dave Wright on saxophone. Turner was later replaced by Sean Oliver (later of Rip, Rig &amp; Panic) on bass. The band split in 1981 and reformed in 2001.

==History==
The group formed in 1978 with Logic fresh out of art school. Their first 7&quot; was released on their own record label, Cells. They then released a self-titled EP on Virgin Records in 1979, before signing to Rough Trade. Their debut studio album, &quot;Beat Rhythm News&quot;, was released in 1979, followed by several 7&quot;s. Work began on a second album but the band split in 1980 and the album, &quot;Pedigree Charm&quot;, was released as a Lora Logic solo LP. 

Between 1978 and 1981, Logic also performed as a member of Red Crayola, as well as playing on recordings by Kollaa Kestää, The Stranglers, The Raincoats and Swell Maps.

Soon after &quot;Pedigree Charm&quot; was released in 1982 on the Rough Trade label, Logic gave up recording and performing: she had turned to the Hare Krishna religion. She did record and perform under the X-Ray Spex name again when they reformed in 1995.

She resumed Essential Logic in 2001 with a new line-up, and released a four-track EP of new material. This version of the group included ex-members of the ska group Bad Manners and guitarist Gary Valentine of Blondie. A year later, a further four tracks from a recording session in 1998 were made available from the website, Vitaminic. In 2003, an anthology of Essential Logic recordings was issued, entitled &quot;Fanfare in the Garden&quot;, on the Kill Rock Stars record label. 

In 2022 a new studio album, &quot;Land of Kali&quot; was released under the Essential Logic name.

<doc id="140484" wikidata="Q244071" url="?curid=140484" title="Kavad I">
<text>Kavad I ( ; 473 – 13 September 531) was the Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 488 to 531, with a two or three-year interruption. A son of Peroz I (), he was crowned by the nobles to replace his deposed and unpopular uncle Balash ().

Inheriting a declining empire where the authority and status of the Sasanian kings had largely ended, Kavad tried to reorganize his empire by introducing many reforms whose implementation was completed by his son and successor, Khosrow I. They were made possible by Kavad&#x27;s use of the Mazdakite preacher Mazdak, leading to a social revolution that weakened the authority of the nobility and the clergy. Because of this, and the execution of the powerful king-maker Sukhra, Kavad was deposed and imprisoned in the Castle of Oblivion. He was replaced by his brother Jamasp. However, with the aid of his sister and an officer named Siyawush, Kavad and some of his followers fled east to the territory of the Hephthalite king, who provided him with an army. This enabled Kavad to restore himself to the throne in 498/9.

Bankrupted by this hiatus, Kavad applied for subsidies from the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I. The Byzantines had originally paid the Iranians voluntarily to maintain the defense of the Caucasus against attacks from the north. Anastasius refused the subsidies, which led Kavad to invade his domains, thus starting the Anastasian War. Kavad first seized Theodosiopolis and Martyropolis respectively, and then Amida after holding the city under siege for three months. The two empires made peace in 506, with the Byzantines agreeing to pay subsidies to Kavad for the maintenance of the fortifications on the Caucasus in return for Amida. Around this time, Kavad also fought a lengthy war against his former allies, the Hephthalites; by 513 he had re-taken the region of Khorasan from them.

In 528, the Iberian War erupted between the Sasanians and Byzantines in what is now eastern Georgia because the Byzantines refused to acknowledge Khosrow as Kavad&#x27;s heir and because of a dispute over Lazica. Although Kavad&#x27;s forces suffered two notable losses at the battles of Dara and Satala, the war was largely indecisive, with both sides suffering heavy losses. In 531, while the Sasanian army was besieging Martyropolis, Kavad died from an illness. He was succeeded by Khosrow I, who inherited a reinvigorated and mighty empire equal to that of the Byzantines.

Because of the many challenges and issues Kavad successfully overcame, he is considered one of the most effective and successful kings to rule the Sasanian Empire. In the words of the Iranologist Nikolaus Schindel, he was &quot;a genius in his own right, even if of a somewhat Machiavellian type.&quot;

== Name ==
Due to increased Sasanian interest in Kayanian history, Kavad was named after the mythological Kayanian king Kavi Kavata. The name is transliterated in Greek as &quot;Kabates&quot;, &quot;Chü-he-to&quot; in Chinese, and &quot;Qubādh&quot; in Arabic. &quot;Qobād&quot; (also &quot;Ghobād&quot; with a ghayn instead of qaf) is the form used in New Persian.

== Background and state of Sasanian Iran ==

The son of the Sasanian shah Peroz I (), Kavad was born in 473. The Sasanian family had been the monarchs of Iran since 224 after the triumph of the first Sasanian shah Ardashir I () over the Parthian (Arsacid) Empire. Although Iranian society was greatly militarised and its elite designated themselves as a &quot;warrior nobility&quot; (&quot;arteshtaran&quot;), it still had a significantly smaller population, was more impoverished, and was a less centralized state compared to the Roman Empire. As a result, the Sasanian shahs had access to fewer full-time fighters, and depended on recruits from the nobility instead. Some exceptions were the royal cavalry bodyguard, garrison soldiers, and units recruited from places outside Iran.

The bulk of the high nobility included the powerful Parthian noble families (known as the &quot;wuzurgan&quot;) that were centered on the Iranian plateau. They served as the backbone of the Sasanian &quot;feudal&quot; army and were largely autonomous. The Sasanian shahs had noticeably little control over the &quot;wuzurgan&quot;; attempts to restrict their self-determination usually resulted in the murder of the shah. Ultimately, the Parthian nobility worked for the Sasanian shah for personal benefit, personal oath, and, conceivably, a common awareness of the &quot;Aryan&quot; (Iranian) kinship they shared with their Persian overlords.

Another vital component of the army was the Armenian cavalry, which was recruited from outside the ranks of the Parthian &quot;wuzurgan&quot;. However, the revolt of Armenia in 451 and the loss of its cavalry had weakened the Sasanians&#x27; attempts to keep the Hunnic tribes (i.e., the Hephthalites, Kidarites, Chionites and Alkhans) of the northeastern border in check. Indeed, Kavad&#x27;s grandfather Yazdegerd II () had managed to hold off the Kidarites during his wars against them, which had occupied him throughout most of his reign. Now, however, Sasanian authority in Central Asia began to decay. 

First in 474 and again in the late 470s/early 480s, Peroz was defeated and captured by the Hephthalites. In his second defeat, he offered to pay thirty mule packs of silver drachms in ransom, but could only pay twenty. Unable to pay the other ten, he sent Kavad in 482 as a hostage to the Hephthalite court until he could pay the rest. He eventually managed to gain the ten mule packs of silver by imposing a poll tax on his subjects, and thus secured the release of Kavad before he mounted his third campaign in 484. There, Peroz was defeated and killed by a Hephthalite army, possibly near Balkh. His army was completely destroyed, and his body was never found. Four of his sons and brothers had also died. The main Sasanian cities of the eastern region of Khorasan−Nishapur, Herat and Marw were now under Hephthalite rule.

Sukhra, a member of the Parthian House of Karen, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, quickly raised a new force and stopped the Hephthalites from achieving further success. Peroz&#x27;s brother, Balash, was elected as shah by the Iranian magnates, most notably Sukhra and the Mihranid general Shapur Mihran. However, Balash proved unpopular among the nobility and clergy who had him blinded and deposed after just four years in 488. Sukhra, who had played a key role in Balash&#x27;s deposition, appointed Kavad as the new shah of Iran. According to Miskawayh (), Sukhra was Kavad&#x27;s maternal uncle.

== First reign ==
===Accession and conditions of the empire===

Kavad ascended the throne in 488 at the age of 15. His youth is emphasized on his coins, which show him with short whiskers. He inherited an empire that had reached its lowest ebb. The nobility and clergy exerted great influence and authority over the nation, and were able to act as king-makers, as seen by their choice to depose Balash. Economically, the empire was not doing well either, the result of drought, famine, and the crushing defeats delivered by the Hephthalites. They had not only seized large parts of its eastern provinces, but had also forced the Sasanians to pay vast amounts of tribute to them, which had depleted the royal treasury of the shah. Rebellions were occurring in the western provinces including Armenia and Iberia. Simultaneously, the country&#x27;s peasant class was growing more and more uneasy and alienated from the elite.

===Conflict with Sukhra over the empire===

The young and inexperienced Kavad was tutored by Sukhra during his first five years as shah. During this period, Kavad was a mere figurehead, whilst Sukhra was the de facto ruler of the empire. This is emphasized by al-Tabari, who states that Sukhra &quot;was in charge of government of the kingdom and the management of affairs ... [T]he people came to Sukhra and undertook all their dealings with him, treating Kavad as a person of no importance and regarding his commands with contempt.&quot; Numerous regions and the representatives of the elite paid tribute to Sukhra, not to Kavad. Sukhra controlled the royal treasury and the Iranian military. In 493, Kavad, having reached adulthood, wanted to put an end to Sukhra&#x27;s dominance, and had him exiled to his native Shiraz in southwestern Iran. Even in exile, however, Sukhra was in control of everything except the kingly crown. He bragged about having put Kavad on the throne.

Alarmed by the thought that Sukhra might rebel, Kavad wanted to get rid of him completely. He lacked the manpower to do so, however, as the army was controlled by Sukhra and the Sasanians relied mainly on the military of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. He found his solution in Shapur of Ray, a powerful nobleman from the House of Mihran, and a resolute opponent of Sukhra. Shapur, at the head of an army of his own men and disgruntled nobles, marched to Shiraz, defeated Sukhra&#x27;s forces, and imprisoned him in the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Even in prison, Sukhra was considered too powerful and was executed. This caused displeasure among some prominent members of the nobility, weakening Kavad&#x27;s status as shah. It also marked the temporary loss of authority of the House of Karen, whose members were exiled to the regions of Tabaristan and Zabulistan, which were away from the Sasanian court in Ctesiphon.

=== The Mazdakite movement and Kavad I&#x27;s deposition ===

According to classical sources, not long after Sukhra&#x27;s execution, a mobad (priest) named Mazdak caught Kavad&#x27;s attention. Mazdak was the chief representative of a religious and philosophical movement called Mazdakism. Not only did it consist of theological teachings, but it also advocated for political and social reforms that would impact the nobility and clergy.

The Mazdak movement was nonviolent and called for the sharing of wealth, women and property, an archaic form of communism. According to modern historians Touraj Daryaee and Matthew Canepa, &#x27;sharing women&#x27; was most likely an overstatement and defamation deriving from Mazdak&#x27;s decree that loosened marriage laws to help the lower classes. Powerful families saw this as a tactic to weaken their lineage and advantages, which was most likely the case. Kavad used the movement as a political tool to curb the power of the nobility and clergy. Royal granaries were distributed, and land was shared among the lower classes.

The historicity of the persona of Mazdak has been questioned. He may have been a fabrication to take the blame away from Kavad. Contemporary historians, including Procopius and Joshua the Stylite make no mention of Mazdak, naming Kavad as the figure behind the movement. Mention of Mazdak only emerges in later Middle Persian Zoroastrian documents, namely the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, the &quot;Denkard&quot;, and the &quot;Zand-i Wahman yasn&quot;. Later Islamic-era sources, particularly al-Tabari, also mention Mazdak. These later writings were perhaps corrupted by Iranian oral folklore, given that blame put on Mazdak for the redistribution of aristocratic properties to the people, is a topic repeated in Iranian oral history. Other &#x27;villains&#x27; in pre-Islamic Iranian history, namely Gaumata in the Behistun Inscription of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great () and Wahnam in the Paikuli inscription of the Sasanian king Narseh (), are frequently accused of similar misdeeds.

The nobility deposed Kavad in 496 for his support of the Mazdakites and his execution of Sukhra. They installed his more impressionable brother Jamasp on the throne.

== Imprisonment, flight and return ==
A council soon took place among the nobility to discuss what to do with Kavad. Gushnaspdad, a member of the Kanarangiyan, the family that held the important title of &quot;kanarang&quot; (military leader of Abarshahr), proposed Kavad be executed. His suggestion was overruled and Kavad was imprisoned instead in the Castle of Oblivion in Khuzestan. According to Procopius&#x27; account, Kavad&#x27;s wife approached the commander of the prison. They came to an understanding that she would be allowed to see Kavad in exchange for sleeping with him. Kavad&#x27;s friend, Siyawush, who was regularly in the same area as the prison, planned his friend&#x27;s escape by preparing horses near the prison. Kavad changed clothes with his wife to disguise himself as a woman, and escaped from the prison and fled with Siyawush.

Tabari&#x27;s account is different. He says that Kavad&#x27;s sister helped him to escape by rolling him in a carpet, which she made the guard believe was soaked with her menstrual blood. The guard did not object or investigate the carpet, &quot;fearing lest he become polluted by it&quot;. One of the authors of the &quot;Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire&quot;, John Robert Martindale, proposes she may have been Sambice, Kavad&#x27;s sister-wife, who was the mother of his eldest son, Kawus.

Regardless, Kavad managed to escape imprisonment and fled to the court of the Hephthalite king, where he took refuge. According to the narratives included in the history of al-Tabari, during his flight Kavad met a peasant girl from Nishapur, named Niwandukht, who became pregnant with his child, who would ascend the throne as Khosrow I. However, the story has been dismissed as &quot;fable&quot; by the Iranologist Ehsan Yarshater. Khosrow&#x27;s mother was in reality a noblewoman from the House of Ispahbudhan, one of the Seven Great Houses.

At the Hephthalite court in Bactria, Kavad gained the support of the Hephthalite king, and also married his daughter, who was Kavad&#x27;s niece. During his stay, Kavad might have witnessed the rise of the Hephthalites to a better position than that of their former suzerains, the Kidarites. The present-day district of Qobadian (the Arabicized form of Kavadian) near Balkh, which was then under Hephthalite rule, was perhaps founded by Kavad and possibly served as his source of revenue. In 498 (or 499), Kavad returned to Iran with a Hephthalite army. When he crossed the domains of the Kanarangiyan in Khorasan, he was met by Adergoudounbades, a member of the family, who agreed to help him. Another noble who supported Kavad was Zarmihr Karen, a son of Sukhra.

Jamasp and the nobility and clergy did not resist as they wanted to prevent another civil war. They agreed that he would be king again with the understanding that he would not hurt Jamasp or the elite. Jamasp was spared, albeit probably blinded, while Gushnaspdad and other nobles who had plotted against Kavad were executed. Generally, however, Kavad secured his position by lenience. Adergoudounbades was appointed the new &quot;kanarang&quot;, while Siyawush was appointed the head of the Sasanian army (&quot;arteshtaran-salar&quot;). Another of Sukhra&#x27;s sons, Bozorgmehr, was made Kavad&#x27;s great minister (&quot;wuzurg framadar&quot;). Kavad&#x27;s reclamation of his throne displays the troubled circumstances of the empire; a small force was able to overwhelm the nobility-clergy alliance.

== Second reign ==
===Reforms===

Kavad&#x27;s reign is noteworthy for his reforms, which he had been able to make with the nobility and clergy weakened by the Mazdakites. They would not be completed under his reign but were continued by his son, Khosrow I. The serious blows the Sasanians had suffered at the hands of the Hephthalites in the last quarter of the 5th century was a key reason behind the reforms the two made. Tax reform was implemented, a poll tax was created, and a review of taxable land was undertaken to ensure that taxation was fair. The empire was divided into four frontier regions (&quot;kust&quot; in Middle Persian), with a &quot;spāhbed&quot; (military commander) in charge of each district; a chancery was also added to keep the soldiers equipped.

Before Kavad and Khosrow&#x27;s reforms, the Iranians&#x27; general (&quot;Eran-spahbed&quot;) managed the empire&#x27;s army. Many of these military commanders were notably from the &quot;wuzurgan&quot; class of Parthia, indicating the continuation of their authority despite the efforts by Kavad and Khosrow. A new priestly office was also created known as the &quot;advocate and judge of the poor&quot; (&quot;driyōšān jādag-gōw ud dādwar&quot;), which assisted the clergy to help the poor and underprivileged, which they had possibly ignored previously.

As a result of the reforms, the power of the &quot;dehqans&quot;, a class of small land-owning magnates, increased substantially. The &quot;dehqans&quot; may have even been created by the reforms in the first place. A group of these &quot;dehqans&quot; was enlisted into a group of cavalry men, who were managed directly by the shah and earned steady wages. This was done to decrease the reliance on the Parthian cavalry. Soldiers were also enlisted from Sasanian allies, such as the Hephthalites, Arabs, and Daylamites. As a result, the newly rejuvenated Sasanian army proved successful in its efforts in subsequent decades. It sacked the Byzantine city of Antioch in 540, conquered Yemen in the 570s, and under the Parthian military commander Bahram Chobin defeated the Hephthalites and their allies, the Western Turkic Khaganate, in the Perso-Turkic war of 588–589.

Although the reforms were beneficial for the Empire, they may also have resulted in the decline of the traditional links between the aristocracy and the crown under Hormizd IV () and Khosrow II (), to the degree that many belonging to the &quot;wuzurgan&quot; class, notably Bahram Chobin of the Mihran family, and later Shahrbaraz of the same family, were bold enough to dispute the legitimacy of the Sasanian family and lay claims to the throne.

===Persecution of Mazdak and his followers===
With his reforms under way by the 520s, Kavad no longer had any use for Mazdak and he officially stopped supporting the Mazdakites. A debate was arranged where not only the Zoroastrian priesthood but also Christian and Jewish leaders slandered Mazdak and his followers. According to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, written several centuries later by the medieval Persian poet Ferdowsi, Kavad had Mazdak and his supporters sent to Khosrow. His supporters were killed in a walled orchard, buried head first with only their feet visible. Khosrow then summoned Mazdak to look at his garden, saying: &quot;You will find trees there that no-one has ever seen and no-one ever heard of even from the mouth of the ancient sages.&quot; Mazdak, seeing his followers&#x27; corpses, screamed and passed out. He was executed afterwards by Khosrow, who had his feet fastened on a gallows and had his men shoot arrows at Mazdak. The validity of the story is uncertain; Ferdowsi used much earlier reports of events to write the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, and thus the story may report some form of contemporary memory.

=== Building projects ===

Many places were founded or re-built under Kavad. He is said to have founded the city Eran-asan-kerd-Kawad in Media; Fahraj in Spahan; and Weh-Kawad, Eran-win(n)ard-Kawad, Kawad-khwarrah, and Arrajan in Pars. He rebuilt Kirmanshah in Media, which he also used as one of his residences. He is also said to have founded a township in Meybod, which was named Haft-adhar (&quot;seven fires&quot;), because of a Zoroastrian fire temple being established there. Its original fire was created by fire brought from seven other temples in Pars, Balkh, Adurbadagan, Nisa, Spahan, Ghazni, and Ctesiphon.

In the Caucasus, Kavad had new fortifications built at Derbent, and ordered the construction of the Apzut Kawat wall (Middle Persian: &quot;*Abzūd Kawād&quot;, &quot;Kavad increased [in glory]&quot; or &quot;has prospered&quot;). The prominent Caucasian Albanian capital of Partaw, which had been rebuilt during the reign of Peroz I and named Perozabad (&quot;the city of Peroz&quot;), was fortified by Kavad and called Perozkavad (&quot;victorious Kavad&quot;). The former Albanian capital of Kabala, a large urban area that included the headquarters of one of the Albanian bishops, was also fortified by Kavad. He founded the city of Baylakan, which by most researchers is identified with the ruins of Oren-kala. Ultimately, these extensive buildings and fortifications transformed Caucasian Albania into a bastion of Iranian presence in the Caucasus.

=== The India trade ===
The Sasanians exerted considerable influence on trade in the region under Kavad. By using the strategic location of the Persian Gulf, the Sasanians interfered to prevent Byzantine traders from taking take part in the India trade. They accomplished this either by bargaining with trade associates in the Indian subcontinent—ranging from the Gupta Empire in the north to the Anuradhapura monarchs of Sri Lanka in the south—or by attacking the Byzantine boats. Iranian traders were also able to seize Indian vessels well before they could make contact with Byzantine traders. These advantages resulted in the Iranian traders establishing something resembling a monopoly over the India trade.

===Anastasian war===
The Sasanians and Byzantines had kept peace since the brief Byzantine–Sasanian War of 440. The last major war between the two empires had been during the reign of Shapur II (). However, war finally erupted in 502. Bankrupted by his hiatus in 496–498/9, Kavad applied for subsidies to the Byzantine Empire, who originally had paid the Iranians voluntarily to maintain the defense of the Caucasus against attacks from the north. The Iranians seemingly saw the money as a debt due to them. But now Emperor Anastasius I () refused subsidies forcing Kavad to attempt to obtain the money by force. In 502, Kavad invaded Byzantine Armenia with a force that included Hephthalite soldiers. He captured Theodosiopolis, perhaps with local support; in any case, the city was undefended by troops and weakly fortified.

He then marched through southwestern Armenia, reportedly without facing any resistance, and entrusted local governor with the administration of the area. He proceeded to cross the Armenian Taurus, and reached Martyropolis, where its governor Theodore, surrendered without any resistance and gave Kavad two years&#x27; worth of taxes collected from the province of Sophene. Because of this, Kavad let Theodore keep his position as governor of the city. Kavad then besieged the fortress-city of Amida through the autumn and winter (502–503). The siege proved to be a far more difficult enterprise than Kavad had expected; the defenders, although unsupported by troops, repelled the Iranian assaults for three months before they were finally defeated. 

He had its inhabitants deported to a city in southern Iran, which he named &quot;Kavad&#x27;s Better Amida&quot; (Weh-az-Amid-Kawad). He left a garrison in Amida which included his general Glon, two &quot;marzbans&quot; (margraves) and 3,000 soldiers. The Byzantines failed in their attempt to recapture the city. Kavad then tried unsuccessfully to capture Edessa in Osroene. In 505 an invasion of Armenia by the Huns from the Caucasus led to an armistice; the Byzantines paid subsidies to the Iranians for the maintenance of the fortifications on the Caucasus, in return for Amida. The peace treaty was signed by the Ispahbudhan aristocrat Bawi, Kavad&#x27;s brother-in-law. Although Kavad&#x27;s first war with the Byzantines did not end with a decisive winner, the conquest of Amida was the greatest accomplishment achieved by a Sasanian force since 359, when the same city had been captured by Shapur II.

===Relations with Christianity===
Kavad&#x27;s relationship with his Christian subjects is unclear. In Christian Iberia, where the Sasanians had earlier tried to spread Zoroastrianism, Kavad represented himself as an advocate of orthodox Zoroastrianism. In Armenia, however, he settled disputes with the Christians and appears to have continued Balash&#x27;s peaceful approach. The Christians of Mesopotamia and Iran proper practised their religion without any persecution, despite the punishment of Christians in Iran proper being briefly mentioned . Like Jamasp, Kavad also supported the patriarch of the Church of the East, Babai, and Christians served in high offices at the Sasanian court. According to Eberhard Sauer, Sasanian monarchs only persecuted other religions when it was in their urgent political interests to do so.

According to the &quot;Chronicle of Seert&quot; and the historian Mari ibn Sulayman, Kavad ordered all the religious communities in the empire to submit written descriptions of their beliefs. This took place sometime before 496. In response to this command, the Patriarch Aqaq commissioned Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye, interpreter of the school of Nisibis, to write for the Church of the East. His work was then translated from Syriac to Middle Persian and presented to Kavad. This work has since been lost.

Kavad&#x27;s reign marked a new turn in Sasanian–Christian relations; before his reign, Jesus had been seen solely as the defender of the Byzantines. This changed under Kavad. According to an apocryphal account in the &quot;Chronicle of Pseudo–Zachariah of Mytilene&quot;, written by an anonymous West Syrian monk at Amida in 569, Kavad saw a vision of Jesus whilst besieging Amida, which encouraged him to remain resolute in his effort. Jesus guaranteed to give him Amida within three days, which happened. Kavad&#x27;s forces then sacked the city, taking much booty. The city&#x27;s church was spared, however, due to the relationship between Kavad and Jesus. Kavad was even thought to have venerated a figure of Jesus. According to modern historian Richard Payne, the Sasanians could now be viewed as adherents of Jesus and his saints, if not Christianity itself.

=== Wars in the east ===
Not much is known about Kavad&#x27;s wars in the east. According to Procopius, Kavad was forced to leave for the eastern frontier in 503 to deal with an attack by &quot;hostile Huns&quot;, one of the many clashes in a reportedly lengthy war. After the Sasanian disaster in 484, all of Khorasan was seized by the Hephthalites; no Sasanian coins minted in the area (Nishapur, Herat, Marw) have been found from his first reign. The increase in the number of coins minted at Gorgan (which was now the northernmost Sasanian region) during his first reign may indicate a yearly tribute he paid to the Hephthalites. During his second reign, his fortunes changed. A Sasanian campaign in 508 led to the conquest of the Zundaber (Zumdaber) Castellum, associated with the temple of az-Zunin in the area of ad-Dawar, situated between Bust and Kandahar. A Sasanian coin dating to 512/3 has been found in Marw. This indicates the Sasanians under Kavad had managed to re-conquer Khorasan after successfully dealing with the Hephthalites.

===Negotiations with the Byzantines over the adoption of Khosrow===

Around 520 to secure the succession of his youngest son Khosrow, whose position was threatened by rival brothers and the Mazdakite sect, and to improve his relationship with the Byzantine emperor Justin I, Kavad proposed that he adopt Khosrow. This proposal was greeted initially with enthusiasm by the Byzantine emperor and his nephew, Justinian. However, Justinian&#x27;s &quot;quaestor&quot;, Proclus, opposed the move concerned over the possibility that Khosrow might attempt to take over the Byzantine throne. The Byzantines made a counter-proposal to adopt Khosrow not as a Roman but as a barbarian. In the end the negotiations did not reach a consensus. Khosrow reportedly felt insulted by the Byzantines, and his attitude towards them deteriorated.

Mahbod and Siyawush were the Sasanian diplomats sent to negotiate with the Byzantines. Mahbod accused Siyawush of purposely sabotaging the negotiations. Further accusations were made against Siyawush, which included his reverence for new deities, and having his dead wife buried, a violation of Iranian law. Siyawush was thus most likely a Mazdakite, the religious sect that Kavad had originally, but now no longer, supported. Although Siyawush was a close friend of Kavad and had helped him escape imprisonment, Kavad did not try to prevent his execution. Seemingly, his purpose was to restrict Siyawush&#x27;s immense authority as the head of the Sasanian army, a post which was disliked by the other nobles. Siyawush was executed, and his office was abolished. Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, it was not until 530 that full-scale warfare on the main western frontier broke out. In the intervening years, the two sides preferred waging war by proxy, through Arab allies in the south and Huns in the north.

===Iberian war===
Hostility between the two powers erupted into conflict once again in 528, just a year after the new Byzantine emperor Justinian I () had been crowned. This was supposedly the result of the Byzantines not acknowledging Khosrow as Kavad&#x27;s heir. According to the Greek chronicler John Malalas, military clashes first took place in Lazica, which had been disputed between the two empires since 522. Not long after this the battles also spread down to Mesopotamia, where the Byzantines suffered a heavy defeat near the border. In 530, one of the famous open-field battles took place between the Byzantine and Sasanian troops at Dara.

The Sasanian army led by Perozes, Pityaxes and Baresmanas suffered a severe defeat. The battle did not, however, bring an end to the conflict. The following year Kavad raised an army, which he sent under Azarethes to invade the Byzantine province of Commagene. When the Byzantine army under Belisarius approached, Azarethes and his men withdrew east, halting at Callinicum. In the ensuing battle the Byzantines suffered a heavy defeat, but Iranian losses were so great Kavad was displeased with Azarethes, and relieved him of his command. In 531, the Iranians besieged Martyropolis. During the siege, however, Kavad became ill and died on 13 September. As a result, the siege was lifted and peace was made between Kavad&#x27;s successor Khosrow I and Justinian.

== Coins ==

The provinces of Gorgan, Khuzestan, and Asoristan provided the most Sasanian coinage for Kavad during his reign. His reign marks the introduction of distinctive traits on the obverse sides of the coin which includes astral symbols, particularly, a crescent on both of his shoulders, and a star in the left corner. The reverse side shows the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants facing it in veneration. Kavad used the title of &quot;kay&quot; (Kayanian) on his coins, a title that had been used since the reign of his grandfather Yazdegerd II (). Kavad was, however, the last Sasanian shah to have &quot;kay&quot; inscribed on his coins—the last one issued in 513. The regular obverse inscription on his coins simply has his name; in 504, however, the slogan &quot;abzōn&quot; (&quot;may he prosper/increase&quot;) was added.

== Succession ==

According to Procopius and other historians, Kavad had written a succession plan that favoured Khosrow just before his death. Historian John Malalas stated that Kavad crowned Khosrow himself. However, at the beginning of Khosrow&#x27;s reign in 531, Bawi and other members of the Iranian aristocracy became involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Khosrow and make Kavad, the son of Kavad&#x27;s second eldest son Jamasp, the shah of Iran. Upon learning of the plot, Khosrow executed all of his brothers and their offspring, as well as Bawi and the other nobles who were involved.

Khosrow also ordered the execution of Kavad, who was still a child, and was away from the court, being raised by Adergoudounbades. He sent orders to kill Kavad, but Adergoudounbades disobeyed and secretly raised him until he was betrayed to the shah in 541 by his own son, Bahram. Khosrow had him executed, but Kavad, or someone claiming to be him, managed to flee to the Byzantine Empire.

== Legacy ==
Kavad&#x27;s reign is considered a turning point in Sasanian history. Since he successfully handled many challenges and issues, he is considered one of the most effective and successful kings to rule the Sasanian Empire. In the words of Iranologist Nikolaus Schindel he was &quot;a genius in his own right, even if of a somewhat Machiavellian type.&quot; He was successful in his efforts to reinvigorate his declining empire, paving the way for a smooth transition to his son Khosrow I, who inherited a powerful empire. Khosrow improved it further during his reign, becoming one of the most popular shahs of Iran and earning the epithet Anushirvan (&quot;the immortal soul&quot;).

The Ziyarid dynasty, which mainly ruled over Tabaristan and Gorgan between 931–1090, claimed that the founder of the dynasty, Mardavij (), was descended from Kavad.

<text>Kavad II () was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran briefly in 628.

Born Sheroe, he was the son of Khosrow II () and Maria. With help from different factions of the nobility, Sheroe overthrew his father in a coup d&#x27;état in 628. At this juncture, the Iranian army had been split into three separate armies, each led by one of the faction leaders. After ascending the throne, he had his father and all his brothers executed. Also, he made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (), thus concluding the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628.

Kavad II soon died of a devastating plague, which became known as the Plague of Sheroe. He was succeeded by his seven-year-old son Ardashir III ().

Contemporary sources and modern historiography present a mixed view of Kavad II, with some of the latter criticizing him for his fratricide, considering it to have heavy consequences for the empire. The Austrian historian and numismatist Nikolaus Schindel in contrast suggests that Kavad II&#x27;s fratricide may have prevented a possible civil war, and had Kavad II lived longer, he might had been able to prevent the disintegration of the Sasanian political structure and the impending Arab-Islamic conquest of Iran.

== Background ==
Born Sheroe, he was the son of Khosrow II (), the last prominent Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran. His mother was Maria, a Byzantine woman which some Eastern sources considered to be a daughter of the emperor Maurice (). However, Byzantine sources do not report that Maurice had a daughter named Maria, much less that he gave her in marriage to a member of the Sasanian dynasty. According to the Austrian historian and numismatist Nikolaus Schindel, Maria most likely belonged to the aristocracy of the Sasanian Empire. The union of Khosrow and Maria took place in 590 at the earliest, making Sheroe 37 years old at maximum when he became king in 628. It is certain Sheroe had at least reached adulthood by then, as he had a seven-year-old son (Ardashir III) when he died in the same year. According to the 7th-century Greek Christian chronicle &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, Sheroe was Khosrow II&#x27;s eldest son. However, this remains uncertain.

== Early life ==

In 602, Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. As a result, Khosrow II proceeded to declare war, ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. During the two-decade war, Khosrow II was initially successful, conquering the Byzantine provinces in the Near East, including Egypt. However, by 627 the tables had turned against the Sasanians, with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius () seizing chunks of Adurbadagan (in present-day northwestern Iran) and laying waste to the temple of Adur Gushnasp. The nobles had grown weary of Khosrow II&#x27;s policies, with some of them possibly already starting to form an opposition against him following the failed siege of Constantinople in 626. During this period, Sheroe was imprisoned in a fortress outside of Babylon together with a couple of unidentified brothers. There they were educated by tutors sent by Khosrow II.

Following the Byzantine sacking of the royal Sasanian residence at Dastagird on 6 January 628, Khosrow II fled to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. There he tried to secure the city and his legacy. He planned to crown his son Mardanshah (whose mother was the Christian queen Shirin) as his heir apparent. When Sheroe was informed of this, he immediately sent his foster brother to Gurdanasp, a former general who led the opposition against Khosrow II. Gurdanasp declined to have an audience with Sheroe, instead asking him to send a letter to express himself. Sheroe soon sent a letter, in which he promised to replace Khosrow II as the &quot;shahanshah&quot;, make peace with the Byzantines and the Western Turkic Khaganate, and increase the rank of the conspirators and the income of the army. Having convinced the conspirators with his letter, Sheroe continued to correspond with them through his foster brother, who made it possible for the two parties to plan their actions for the upcoming &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

== The coup against Khosrow II ==
===Preparations===

It was essential for the conspirators to move quickly to catch Khosrow II and his men off guard. To maintain contact between Ctesiphon and Veh-Ardashir, it was necessary to occupy the pontoon bridge over the Tigris River. The core of individuals involved in the conspiracy had to grow as quickly as feasible. To gather more support, they had to make the political equivalent of a shock attack. The conspirators agreed to stage the coup on the night of 23/24 February. They made the decision to inform Heraclius of the situation by sending a group of deputies to him. They required assurance that the Byzantines would be prepared to talk peace terms with a newly established Iranian government. They must have felt encouraged by Heraclius&#x27; recent proposition to Khosrow II, but they required a clear promise from him. Much justification for the coup attempt would be gone if there was no assurance that the Byzantines would also favor making peace, as the Sasanian state would get weakened by the coup.

Four army commanders and two high-ranking civilians made up the deputation that departed. The &quot;hazarbed&quot; Gousdanaspa Razei was in charge of it. Once Heraclius had given the desired assurance, Gousdanaspa Razei was permitted to tell him about the details of the scheme, the upcoming coup, and its date. The deputation needed about a week&#x27;s worth of time because the Byzantine army was about 200 kilometers from Ctesiphon. They thus must have departed by 17 February to be in time for the coup on 23/24 February. They met with Heraclius in Shahrazur, most likely around 19 February. There they received his assurance, and in return informed him of the details of the coup.

===The coup===
At night, a group of distinguished state officials brought Sheroe into Veh-Ardashir. Along with removing the horses from the royal stables and transporting them over the river, the conspirators from Ctesiphon crossed the bridge to meet him. A messenger called attention to Sheroe&#x27;s takeover of authority and called for people to join his cause. The prisoners were freed, being told that the new &quot;shahanshah&quot; had opened the &quot;gates of life&quot; for them. They stole the horses from the royal stables and rode on them around while displaying their chains and berating Khosrow II. Instead of lending the coup military power, their main role was to intensify the revolutionary climate through their yelling and galloping. Heraclius had previously suggested that the conspirators free and arm the Byzantine prisoners of war, though there is no proof that they followed his advice.

The palace guards were made aware of the situation by the ruckus coming from Veh-Ardashir, and several of them crossed the bridge to join the rebels. Khosrow II inquired about the commotion and trumpet noise. He tried to flee after learning the truth from his attendants but discovered that the royal stables were empty. The last of the guards fled as the rebels crossed the river around daybreak and moved toward the palace. Khosrow II disguised himself and went to the palace&#x27;s gardens, where he hid. A search crew discovered him there; he was then apprehended, cuffed, and imprisoned in the new treasury building. The following day, on 25 February, Sheroe ascended the throne, adopting &quot;Kavad&quot; as his regal name.

== Reign ==
===Execution of his father and brothers===

The conspirators that overthrew Khosrow II and installed Kavad II on the throne were composed of several powerful dynastic factions; the &quot;Nemrozi&quot; faction led by Mihr Hormozd; Shahrbaraz, who represented a branch of the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and the Kanarangiyan. At this juncture, the Iranian army had been split into three separate armies; the army of Adurbadagan led by Farrukh Hormizd; the occupation army of Shahrbaraz; and the army of Nemroz, led by Mihr Hormozd.

Right after Kavad II&#x27;s accession, the grandees pressured him to have Khosrow II executed, telling him that &quot;It is not fitting that we should have two kings: either you kill Khosrow, and we will be your faithful and obedient servants, or we shall depose you and give our obedience to him [Khosrow] just as we always did before you secured the royal power.&quot; Kavad II, terrified and devastated, dispatched Asfadjushnas as a deputy to Khosrow II. Asfadjushnas&#x27; task was to explain to Khosrow II all the crimes he had committed, and the reasons for his removal and eventual execution. The lengthy discussion between the two is recounted by al-Tabari. Agitated, Kavad II ordered his father to be executed. Although various figures wanted vengeance upon Khosrow II, no one dared to commit regicide. Mihr Hormozd eventually volunteered. He was the son of Mardanshah, the former &quot;padgospan&quot; of Nemroz, who had at his own request been executed by Khosrow II, due to being mutilated and dishonored by the latter. Khosrow II was executed on 28 February 628.

It was also either during this period or later, that Kavad II had all his brothers (17 or 18 of them) executed. This was done at the instigation of his minister Piruz Khosrow and Shamta, the son of Khosrow II&#x27;s treasurer Yazdin. Al-Tabari describes the executed brothers as &quot;men of good education, bravery, and the manly virtues&quot;. He adds that Kavad II was scolded by his sisters Boran and Azarmidokht for his actions, which caused him to become remorseful.

=== Peace negotiations with the Byzantine Empire ===
Following his accession, Kavad II sent two groups of deputies to inform Heraclius of his victory. The first group was composed of a Persian and an Armenian, sent in advance to make preparations for the safe passage of the other group, led by Chosdaï, a high-rank royal secretary. The first group met with Heraclius on 24 March, where they gave him a letter from Chosdaï, which said that the latter was on his way with a group of delegates from the government and would be bringing written suggestions from the new &quot;shahanshah&quot;. On 3 April, Heraclius met with Chosdaï, who gave him a letter from Kavad II as well as lavish gifts. There Chosdaï provided thoroughly thought-out peace offers. After consolidating his position, Kavad II had turned to the Sasanian Empire&#x27;s most influential constituency—the noble estate—for formal permission to begin peace negotiations with the Byzantines. This was easily gained, as the coup against Khosrow II owed its success to the extensive war-weariness and vehement dissatisfaction at many of the policies implemented in order to prolong the war effort.

It was acknowledged that the majority of Khosrow II&#x27;s enormous territorial gains would need to be given up. However, it was not what the exact frontier line should look like. Although Byzantium and Iran had been neighbours for a very long time, a precise definition of their geographic boundaries had not been established. Arguments could be made in favor of all of the several frontiers that had separated their lands since the resurgence of Iranian authority in the middle of the 3rd-century, due to the lack of any evident topographical, ethnic, or cultural line of boundary south or north of the Armenian Taurus Mountains.

The letter sent by Kavad II to Heraclius from this period has partly survived in the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;. In it, he labels Heraclius as &quot;the most clement Roman emperor, our brother&quot; in contrast to Khosrow II&#x27;s belittling message towards the latter. By using the word &quot;brother&quot;, Kavad II made it clear right away that he acknowledged the Byzantine Empire as legitimate and equals of Iran. He was thus swiftly re-establishing the dualistic world order that had been dominant for four centuries. He announced his ascension to the throne of his fathers and forefathers via the protection of God in the letter&#x27;s body, which was kept brief. Kavad II was doing everything in his power to avoid supporting the idea that the war had been a religious conflict by omitting mention of the divinities in Zoroastrianism.

He claimed that he intended to free every individual held in jail, including political opponents of his father and prisoners of war, as a sign of his commitment to doing whatever could be helpful and in the service of mankind. The letter did not discuss how to fix the borders. Instead, Chosdaï had to relay the Sasanian offer to withdraw from Byzantine territory verbally, and Heraclius had to respond in writing with precise suggestions on how to fix the borders. A solemn oath, sealed in the customary Persian fashion with salt, was placed within the letter.

Heraclius responded with a letter four days later, which has also partly survived. In the first portion, only the final few words of each line have been preserved. He confirmed receiving the letter brought by Chosdaï, congratulated Kavad II on becoming king (mentioning both God&#x27;s role and Kavad II&#x27;s good fate), and wished him many years of success, vigor, and peace. He also recognized Kavad II&#x27;s stated intention to work in the service of mankind. The rest of Heraclius&#x27; letter has not survived.

The English historian James Howard-Johnston suggests that the rest of Heraclius&#x27; letter was a general statement, in which he said that he was prepared to make peace, along with some indication of what he thought should be a fair boundary to draw between the two empires. In accordance with the conditions of his earlier offer, Kavad II would then be required to make arrangements for the Iranian soldiers&#x27; withdrawal from what was acknowledged to be Byzantine land and the release of all Byzantine prisoners of war. This is all implied in the &quot;History of Khosrov&quot;, a source that Howard-Johnston considers to be the &quot;only trustworthy account of the second stage of negotiations.&quot; The Byzantine writer Nikephoros I claims that in the letter Heraclius called Kavad II his &quot;son,&quot; thus declaring superiority over the Sasanian Empire. Howard-Johnston dismisses this claim, amongst other things arguing that due to the weakened Byzantine military, Heraclius was in no position to make such an assertion.

After the negotiations were successful, Kavad II started carrying out the agreement&#x27;s obligations. He gave orders for a letter to be written, telling Shahrbaraz to assemble his troops and head back to Iranian land, which he refused. According to Howard-Johnston, Shahrbaraz—having conquered the Byzantine Middle East—was not willing to give up more or less everything he had achieved in order to stop more violence and expenditure. However, the Iranologist Parvaneh Pourshariati suggests that Shahrbaraz&#x27;s noncompliance was due to his concern of the collaboration of the other factions of Iran, who were managing the affairs of the state while he was still in Byzantine territory. Shahrbaraz&#x27;s refusal led to a deadlock, which would last for months. However, for the time being, Heraclius and his men could march home in peace, assured that the protracted conflict was finished, while the Iranian military could start preparing operations against the Turks in the South Caucasus.

=== Death and succession ===
Kavad II soon died of a devastating plague, which became known as the Plague of Sheroe. According to the 10th-century Arab historian and geographer al-Masudi, at least a third of Iran&#x27;s population—or perhaps even half—died to the plague. Al-Tabari reported that &quot;most of the Persians perished.&quot; According to the modern historian Michael Bonner, epidemic sickness would have quickly swept throughout Mesopotamia&#x27;s crowded and densely populated communities. He adds that while it is possible the highlands of Iran remained unharmed, sources raise the possibility that the plague&#x27;s impact on Ctesiphon urban area was as devastating as they claim. It is uncertain around what time Kavad II died, as sources differ on whether he ruled six, seven, or eight months. He died in late summer or early autumn, and was succeeded by his seven-year-old son Ardashir III, who was supervised by Mah-Adhur Gushnasp as his regent.

== Religious policy ==
Kavad II, like all other Sasanian rulers, was an adherent of Zoroastrianism. The government of Kavad II helped Christian churches, such as giving the Church of the East permission to nominate their own catholicos, a privilege they had lost since 609.

== Coinage and imperial ideology ==

The majority of his Khosrow II&#x27;s design ideas on Sasanian coins were abandoned by Kavad II, including the numerous rims on the obverse and reverse, Verethragna&#x27;s wings in the crown, the word &quot;xwarrah&quot; (&quot;royal splendor)&quot; and a star symbol, which had replaced the korymbos. On the obverse of Kavad II&#x27;s coins, the engraving reads &quot;Kawād pērōz&quot; (&quot;Kavad the victorious&quot;).

Although the previous Sasanian monarch Kavad I () was not portrayed positively by the royal propaganda of Kavad II, the latter still chose to adopt his name. Schindel calls this choice &quot;somewhat surprising&quot;.

== Family ==
A passage of the &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot; identifies &quot;Anzoy the Roman&quot; as the wife of Kavad II and mother of Ardashir III. She was probably a Christian princess from the Byzantine Empire.

According to &quot;Guidi&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, Boran was also Kavad II&#x27;s wife, demonstrating the practice in Zoroastrianism of &quot;Xwedodah&quot;, or close-kin marriage.

== Legacy and assessment ==
The personal power of the &quot;shahanshah&quot; was lower under Kavad II than under Khosrow II. The fact that the &quot;shahanshah&quot; had stopped leading his army into battle since Hormizd IV () may have been a significant contributing element. This may have caused a growing disconnection between the army and the &quot;shahanshah&quot;, which gave military commanders (such as Bahram Chobin and Shahrbaraz) the opportunity to challenge the &quot;shahanshah&quot;—something which never happened in earlier Sasanian history. Pourshariati considers Kavad II to have had little authority, arguing that the factions who had overthrown Khosrow II were in control of the affairs of the empire.

Some sources such as al-Tabari consider Kavad II to be a bad ruler, while others such as the &quot;Chronicle of Seert&quot; paint a more favorable picture of him. Schindel suggests that if Kavad II had lived longer, he might had been able to prevent the disintegration of the Sasanian political structure and the impending Arab-Islamic conquest of Iran.

Assessing Kavad II&#x27;s execution of his brothers, Schindel also states that; &quot;While one cannot defend the slaughter of his brothers from an ethical point of view, it might have seemed preferable to risking a civil war if any of these potential rivals should have made a bid for the throne, especially given the depleted military manpower. At the same time, such a desperate measure was not completely new, since Hormizd IV is also said to have killed his brothers upon his accession.&quot; According to Bonner, Kavad II&#x27;s reign was &quot;disgraced by the massacre of his brothers&quot; and that the &quot;near extermination of the male line of the Sasanian family was to disrupt the royal succession forever, and royal prestige never recovered.&quot; Iranologist Touraj Daryaee states that Kavad II&#x27;s fratricide &quot;would have a devastating effect on the future of the empire.&quot;

Kavad II appears under the name &quot;Siroes&quot; in an apocalyptic chronicle, in which he fights Nehemiah over control of Jerusalem. The Jews escape after Siroes kills the progenitor of the Messiah. According to the prophecy, the events would take place in 1058. The modern historian Israel Levi places the author&#x27;s residence in Palestine and dates the work to 629–636. The Jews of Palestine had great hopes for a Messianic verdict in history when the Iranians took control of Jerusalem, and thus despised Kavad II for his murder of his father and subsequent peace with Heraclius. Considered the epitome of the anti-messiah, Kavad II was as a result made into a villain in the messianic story.

<text>A penny is a coin (: pennies) or a unit of currency (: pence) in various countries. Borrowed from the Carolingian denarius (hence its former abbreviation d.), it is usually the smallest denomination within a currency system. At present, it is the formal name of the British penny ( p) and the &quot;de facto&quot; name of the American one-cent coin ( ¢). Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to merchants, banks, government mints and the public in general.

&quot;Penny&quot; is also the informal name of the cent unit of account in Canada, although one-cent coins were removed from circulation in 2012. 

The name &quot;penny&quot; is also used in reference to various historical currencies, also derived from the Carolingian system, such as the French denier and the German pfennig. It may also be informally used to refer to any similar smallest-denomination coin, such as the euro cent or Chinese fen.

The Carolingian penny was originally a 0.940-fine silver coin, weighing pound. It was adopted by Offa of Mercia and other English kings and remained the principal currency in Europe over the next few centuries, until repeated debasements necessitated the development of more valuable coins. The British penny remained a silver coin until the expense of the Napoleonic Wars prompted the use of base metals in 1797. Despite the decimalization of currencies in the United States and, later, throughout the British Commonwealth, the name remains in informal use.

No penny is currently formally subdivided, although farthings (d), halfpennies, and half cents have previously been minted and the mill (¢) remains in use as a unit of account in some contexts.

==Etymology==
&quot;Penny&quot; is first attested in a 1394 Scots text, a variant of Old English , a development of numerous variations including , , and . The etymology of the term &quot;penny&quot; is uncertain, although cognates are common across almost all Germanic languages and suggest a base *&quot;pan-&quot;, *&quot;pann-&quot;, or *&quot;pand-&quot; with the individualizing suffix &quot;-ing&quot;. Common suggestions include that it was originally *&quot;panding&quot; as a Low Franconian form of Old High German &quot;pawn&quot; (in the sense of a pledge or debt, as in a pawnbroker putting up collateral as a pledge for repayment of loans); *&quot;panning&quot; as a form of the West Germanic word for &quot;frying pan&quot;, presumably owing to its shape; and *&quot;ponding&quot; as a very early borrowing of Latin (&quot;pound&quot;). Recently, it has been proposed that it may represent an early borrowing of Punic (&quot;Pane&quot; or &quot;Pene&quot;, &quot;Face&quot;), as the face of Carthaginian goddess Tanit was represented on nearly all Carthaginian currency. Following decimalization, the British and Irish coins were marked &quot;new penny&quot; until 1982 and 1985, respectively.

From the 16th century, the regular plural &quot;pennies&quot; fell out of use in England, when referring to a sum of money (e.g. &quot;That costs tenpence.&quot;), but continued to be used to refer to more than one penny coin (&quot;Here you are, a sixpence and four pennies.&quot;). It remains common in Scottish English, and is standard for all senses in American English, where, however, the informal &quot;penny&quot; is typically only used of the coins in any case, values being expressed in &quot;cents&quot;. The informal name for the American cent seems to have spread from New York State.

In Britain, prior to decimalization, values from two to eleven pence were often written, and spoken as a single word, as &quot;twopence&quot; or &quot;tuppence&quot;, &quot;threepence&quot; or &quot;thruppence&quot;, etc. (Other values were usually expressed in terms of shillings and pence or written as two words, which might or might not be hyphenated.) Where a single coin represented a number of pence, it was treated as a single noun, as &quot;a sixpence&quot;. Thus, &quot;a threepence&quot; (but more usually &quot;a threepenny bit&quot;) would be a single coin of that value whereas &quot;three pence&quot; would be its value, and &quot;three pennies&quot; would be three penny coins. In British English, divisions of a penny were added to such combinations without a conjunction, as &quot;sixpence-farthing&quot;, and such constructions were also treated as single nouns. Adjectival use of such coins used the ending -penny, as &quot;sixpenny&quot;.

The British abbreviation d. derived from the Latin . It followed the amount, e.g. &quot;11d&quot;. It has been replaced since decimalization by p, usually written without a space or period. From this abbreviation, it is common to speak of pennies and values in pence as &quot;p&quot;. In North America, it is common to abbreviate cents with the currency symbol ¢. Elsewhere, it is usually written with a simple c.

==History==

===Antiquity===

The medieval silver penny was modeled on similar coins in antiquity, such as the Greek drachma, the Carthaginian shekel, and the Roman denarius. Forms of these seem to have reached as far as Norway and Sweden. The use of Roman currency in Britain, seems to have fallen off after the Roman withdrawal and subsequent Saxon invasions.

===Frankish Empire===

Charlemagne&#x27;s father Pepin the Short instituted a major currency reform around aiming to reorganize Francia&#x27;s previous silver standard with a standardized .940-fine () weighing 1⁄240 pound. (As the Carolingian pound seems to have been about 489.5 grams, each penny weighed about 2 grams.) Around 790, Charlemagne introduced a new .950 or .960-fine penny with a smaller diameter. Surviving specimens have an average weight of although some estimate the original ideal mass at But despite the purity and quality of these pennies, they were often rejected by traders throughout the Carolingian period, in favor of the gold coins used elsewhere; this led to repeated legislation against such refusal, to accept the king&#x27;s currency.

===England===
Some of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms initially copied the solidus, the late Roman gold coin; at the time, however, gold was so rare and valuable that even the smallest coins had such a great value that they could only be used in very large transactions and were sometimes not available at all. Around 641–670, there seems to have been a movement to use coins with lower gold content. This decreased their value and may have increased the number that could be minted, but these paler coins do not seem to have solved the problem of the value and scarcity of the currency. The miscellaneous silver sceattas minted in Frisia and Anglo-Saxon England after around 680 were probably known as &quot;pennies&quot; at the time. (The misnomer is based on a probable misreading of the Anglo-Saxon legal codes.) Their purity varied and their weight fluctuated from about 0.8 to about 1.3 grams. They continued to be minted in East Anglia under Beonna and in Northumbria as late as the mid-9th century.

The first Carolingian-style pennies were introduced by King Offa of Mercia ( 757–796), modeled on Pepin&#x27;s system. His first series was of the Saxon pound of , giving a pennyweight of about His queen Cynethryth also minted these coins under her own name. Near the end of his reign, Offa minted his coins in imitation of Charlemagne&#x27;s reformed pennies. Offa&#x27;s coins were imitated by East Anglia, Kent, Wessex and Northumbria, as well as by two Archbishops of Canterbury. As in the Frankish Empire, all these pennies were notionally fractions of shillings (; ) and pounds (; ) but during this period neither larger unit was minted. Instead, they functioned only as notional units of account. (For instance, a &quot;shilling&quot; or &quot;solidus&quot; of grain was a measure equivalent to the amount of grain that 12 pennies could purchase.) English currency was notionally .925-fine sterling silver at the time of Henry II, but the weight and value of the silver penny steadily declined from 1300 onwards.

In 1257, Henry III minted a gold penny which had the nominal value of 1 shilling 8 pence (i.e. 20 &quot;d.&quot;). At first, the coin proved unpopular because it was overvalued for its weight; by 1265 it was so undervalued—the bullion value of its gold being worth 2 shillings (i.e. 24 &quot;d.&quot;) by then—that the coins still in circulation were almost entirely melted down for the value of their gold. Only eight gold pennies are known to survive. It was not until the reign of that the florin and noble established a common gold currency in England.
The earliest halfpenny and farthing (¼&quot;d.&quot;) found date from the reign of Henry III. The need for small change was also sometimes met by simply cutting a full penny into halves or quarters. In 1527, Henry VIII abolished the Tower pound of 5400 grains, replacing it with the Troy pound of 5760 grains (making a penny 5760/240 = 24 grains) and establishing a new pennyweight of 1.56 grams, although, confusingly, the penny coin by then weighed about 8 grains, and had never weighed as much as this 24 grains. The last silver pence for general circulation were minted during the reign of Charles II around 1660. Since then, they have only been coined for issue as Maundy money, royal alms given to the elderly on Maundy Thursday.

===United Kingdom===

Throughout the 18th century, the British government did not mint pennies for general circulation and the bullion value of the existing silver pennies caused them to be withdrawn from circulation. Merchants and mining companies, such as Anglesey&#x27;s Parys Mining Co., began to issue their own copper tokens to fill the need for small change. Finally, amid the Napoleonic Wars, the government authorized Matthew Boulton to mint copper pennies and twopences at Soho Mint in Birmingham in 1797. Typically, 1 lb. of copper produced 24 pennies. In 1860, the copper penny was replaced with a bronze one (95% copper, 4% tin, 1% zinc). Each pound of bronze was coined into 48 pennies.

===United States===

The United States&#x27; cent, popularly known as the &quot;penny&quot; since the early 19th century, began with the unpopular copper chain cent in 1793. Abraham Lincoln was the first historical figure to appear on a U.S. coin when he was portrayed on the one-cent coin to commemorate his 100th birthday.

===South Africa===
The penny that was brought to the Cape Colony (in what is now South Africa) was a large coin—36 mm in diameter, 3.3 mm thick, and —and the twopence was correspondingly larger at 41 mm in diameter, 5 mm thick and . On them was Britannia with a trident in her hand. The English called this coin the Cartwheel penny due to its large size and raised rim, but the Capetonians referred to it as the Devil&#x27;s Penny as they assumed that only the Devil used a trident. The coins were very unpopular due to their large weight and size. On 6 June 1825, Lord Charles Somerset, the governor, issued a proclamation that only British Sterling would be legal tender in the Cape Colony (colonial South Africa). The new British coins (which were introduced in England in 1816), among them being the shilling, six-pence of silver, the penny, half-penny, and quarter-penny in copper, were introduced to the Cape. Later two-shilling, four-penny, and three-penny coins were added to the coinage. The size and denomination of the 1816 British coins, with the exception of the four-penny coins, were used in South Africa until 1960.

==Criticism of continued use==

Handling and counting penny coins entail transaction costs that may be higher than a penny. It has been claimed that, for micropayments, the mental arithmetic costs more than the penny. Changes in the market prices of metals, combined with currency inflation, have caused the metal value of penny coins to exceed their face value.

Canada adopted 5¢ as its lowest denomination in 2012. Several nations have stopped minting equivalent value coins, and efforts have been made to end the routine use of pennies in several countries. In the UK, since 1992, one- and two-penny coins have been made from copper-plated steel (making them magnetic) instead of bronze.

==In popular culture==
* In British and American culture, finding a penny is traditionally considered lucky. A proverbial expression of this is &quot;Find a penny, pick it up, and all the day you&#x27;ll have good luck.&quot;
* &quot;A penny for your thoughts&quot; is an idiomatic way of asking someone what they are thinking about. It is first attested in John Heywood&#x27;s 1547 &quot;Dialogue Conteinying the Nomber in Effect of All the Proverbes in the Englishe Tongue&quot;, at a time when the penny was still a sterling silver coin.
* &quot;In for a penny, in for a pound,&quot; is a common expression used to express someone&#x27;s intention to see an undertaking through, however much time, effort, or money this entails.
* To &quot;give (one&#x27;s) tuppence/tuppenny/two&#x27;penneth (worth)&quot;, is a commonwealth saying that uses the words for two pence to share one&#x27;s opinion, idea, or point of view, regardless of whether or not others want to hear it. A similar expression using the US term of cents is my two cents.
* In British English, to &quot;spend a penny&quot; means to urinate. Its etymology is literal: coin-operated public toilets commonly charged a pre-decimal penny, beginning with the Great Exhibition of 1851.
* &quot;Tuppence&quot; – Old British slang word for ‘vagina’.
* In 1936 U.S. shoemaker G.H. Bass &amp; Co. introduced its &quot;Weejuns&quot; penny loafers. Other companies followed with similar products.
* A common myth is that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building would kill a person or crack the sidewalk. However, a penny is too light and has too much air resistance to acquire enough speed to do much damage since it reaches terminal velocity after falling about 50 feet.

<text>Khosrow II (spelled Chosroes II in classical sources; and &quot;Khosrau&quot;), commonly known as Khosrow Parviz (New Persian: , &quot;Khosrow the Victorious&quot;), is considered to be the last great Sasanian King of Kings (Shahanshah) of Iran, ruling from 590 to 628, with an interruption of one year.

Khosrow II was the son of Hormizd IV (reigned 579–590), and the grandson of Khosrow I (reigned 531–579). He was the last king of Iran to have a lengthy reign before the Muslim conquest of Iran, which began five years after his execution. He lost his throne, then recovered it with the help of the Byzantine emperor Maurice, and, a decade later, went on to emulate the feats of the Achaemenids, conquering the rich Roman provinces of the Middle East; much of his reign was spent in wars with the Byzantine Empire and struggling against usurpers such as Bahram Chobin and Vistahm.

Khosrow II began a war against the Byzantines in 602, ostensibly to avenge the murder of his ally Maurice. Persian forces captured much of the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s territories, earning Khosrow II the epithet &quot;the Victorious&quot;. A siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 626 was unsuccessful, and Heraclius, now allied with Turks, started a risky but successful counterattack deep into Persia&#x27;s heartland. Dissatisfied with the war, the feudal families of the empire supported a coup in which Khosrow II was deposed and killed by his estranged son Sheroe, who took power as Kavad II. This led to a civil war and interregnum in the empire and the reversal of all Sasanian gains in the war against the Byzantines.

In works of Persian literature such as the Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and Nizami Ganjavi&#x27;s (1141–1209) &quot;Khosrow and Shirin&quot;, a famous tragic romance and a highly elaborated fictional version of Khosrow&#x27;s life made him one of the greatest heroes of the culture, as much a lover as a king. &quot;Khosrow and Shirin&quot; tells the story of his love for the originally Aramean princess Shirin, who becomes his queen after a lengthy courtship strewn with mishaps and difficulties.

== Name ==

 is the New Persian variant of his name used by scholars; in Middle Persian, his name is , which derives from Avestan (&quot;he who has good fame&quot;). The name is rendered in Greek as &quot;Chosroes&quot; () and in Arabic as &quot;Kisra&quot;. He was given the epithet (New Persian / ), meaning &quot;victorious.&quot; His name in combination with the epithet is attested in Georgian as (Pseudo-Juansher, writing around the year 800) and in Armenian as .

== Background ==
Khosrow II was born in ; he was the son of Hormizd IV and an unnamed noblewoman from the House of Ispahbudhan, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. Her brothers, Vinduyih and Vistahm, were to have a profound influence in Khosrow II&#x27;s early life. Khosrow&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the famed Sasanian shah Khosrow I Anushirvan (), whilst his paternal grandmother was the daughter of the khagan of the Khazars. Khosrow is first mentioned in the 580s, when he was at Partaw, the capital of Caucasian Albania. During his stay there, he served as the governor of the kingdom, and managed to put an end to the Kingdom of Iberia and make it into a Sasanian province. Furthermore, Khosrow II also served as the governor of Arbela in Mesopotamia sometime before his accession to the throne.

== Rebellion of Bahram Chobin ==
=== Overthrow of Hormizd IV and accession ===

In 590, Hormizd IV had his prominent general Bahram Chobin disgraced and dismissed. Bahram, infuriated by Hormizd&#x27;s actions, responded by rebelling, and due to his noble status and great military knowledge, was joined by his soldiers and many others. He then appointed a new governor for Khorasan, and afterwards set out for the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. The legitimacy of the House of Sasan was based on acceptance that the halo of kingship, the &quot;xwarrah&quot;, was given to the first Sasanian shah, Ardashir I () and his family following the latter&#x27;s conquest of the Parthian Empire. This was now, however, disputed by Bahram Chobin, thus marking the first time in Sasanian history that a Parthian dynast challenged the legitimacy of the Sasanian family by rebelling.

Meanwhile, Hormizd tried to come to terms with his brothers-in-law Vistahm and Vinduyih, who according to the Syriac writer Joshua the Stylite, both &quot;equally hated Hormizd&quot;. The two brothers overthrew Hormizd in a seemingly bloodless palace revolution. They had Hormizd blinded with a red-hot needle, and put Khosrow II on the throne. Sometime in the summer of 590, the two brothers then had Hormizd killed, with at least the implicit approval of Khosrow II. Nevertheless, Bahram Chobin continued his march to Ctesiphon, now with the pretext of claiming to avenge Hormizd.

Khosrow then took a carrot and stick attitude, and wrote a message to Bahram Chobin, stressing his rightful claim to the Sasanian kingship: &quot;Khosrow, kings of kings, ruler over the ruling, lord of the peoples, prince of peace, salvation of men, among gods the good and eternally living man, among men the most esteemed god, the highly illustrious, the victor, the one who rises with the sun and who lends the night his eyesight, the one famed through his ancestors, the king who hates, the benefactor who engaged the Sasanians and saved the Iranians their kingship—to Bahram, the general of the Iranians, our friend... We have also taken over the royal throne in a lawful manner and have upset no Iranian customs... We have so firmly decided not to take off the diadem that we even expected to rule over other worlds, if this were possible... If you wish your welfare, think about what is to be done.&quot;

=== Fight ===

Bahram Chobin, however, ignored his warning—a few days later, he reached the Nahrawan Canal near Ctesiphon, where he fought Khosrow&#x27;s men, who were heavily outnumbered, but managed to hold Bahram Chobin&#x27;s men back in several clashes. However, Khosrow&#x27;s men eventually began losing their morale, and were in the end defeated by Bahram Chobin&#x27;s forces. Khosrow, together with his two uncles, his wives, and a retinue of 30 nobles, thereafter fled to Byzantine territory, while Ctesiphon fell to Bahram Chobin. Bahram Chobin declared himself king of kings in the summer of 590, asserting that the first Sasanian king Ardashir I () had usurped the throne of the Arsacids, and that he now was restoring their rule.

Bahram Chobin tried to support his cause with the Zoroastrian apocalyptic belief that by the end of Zoroaster&#x27;s millennium, chaos and destructive wars with the Hephthalites/Huns and the Romans occurs and then a savior would appear. Indeed, the Sasanians had misidentified Zoroaster&#x27;s era with that of the Seleucids (312 BC), which put Bahram Chobin&#x27;s life almost at the end of Zoroaster&#x27;s millennium, he was therefore hailed by many as the promised savior Kay Bahram Varjavand. Bahram was to re-establish the Arsacid Empire and commenced a new millennium of dynastic rule. He started minting coins, where he is on the front imitated as an exalted figure, bearded and wearing a crenellation-shaped crown with two crescents of the moon, whilst the reverse shows the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants. Regardless, many nobles and priests still chose to side with the inexperienced and less dominant Khosrow II.

In order to get the attention of the Byzantine emperor Maurice (r. 582–602), Khosrow II went to Syria, and sent a message to the Sasanian occupied city of Martyropolis to stop their resistance against the Byzantines, but with no avail. He then sent a message to Maurice, and requested his help to regain the Sasanian throne, which the Byzantine emperor agreed with; in return, the Byzantines would re-gain sovereignty over the cities of Amida, Carrhae, Dara and Martyropolis. Furthermore, Iran was required to stop intervening in the affairs of Iberia and Armenia, effectively ceding control of Lazistan to the Byzantines.

===Return to Iran===

In 591, Khosrow moved to Constantia and prepared to invade Bahram Chobin&#x27;s territories in Mesopotamia, while Vistahm and Vinduyih were raising an army in Adurbadagan under the observation of the Byzantine commander John Mystacon, who was also raising an army in Armenia. After some time, Khosrow, along with the Byzantine commander of the south, Comentiolus, invaded Mesopotamia. During this invasion, Nisibis and Martyropolis quickly defected to them, and Bahram Chobin&#x27;s commander Zatsparham was defeated and killed. One of Bahram Chobin&#x27;s other commanders, Bryzacius, was captured in Mosil and had his nose and ears cut off, and was thereafter sent to Khosrow, where he was killed. Khosrow II and the Byzantine general Narses then penetrated deeper into Bahram&#x27;s territory, seizing Dara and then Mardin in February, where Khosrow was re-proclaimed king. Shortly after this, Khosrow sent one of his Iranian supporters, Mahbodh, to capture Ctesiphon, which he managed to accomplish.

At the same time a force of 8,000 Iranians under Vistahm and Vinduyih and 12,000 Armenians under Mushegh II Mamikonian invaded Adurbadagan. Bahram Chobin tried to disrupt the force by writing a letter to Mushegh II, the letter said: &quot;As for you Armenians who demonstrate an unseasonable loyalty, did not the house of Sasan destroy your land and sovereignty? Why otherwise did your fathers rebel and extricate themselves from their service, fighting up until today for your country?&quot; Bahram Chobin in his letter promised that the Armenians would become partners of the new Iranian empire ruled by a Parthian dynastic family if he accepted his proposal to betray Khosrow II. Mushegh, however, rejected the offer.

Bahram Chobin was then defeated at the Battle of Blarathon, forcing him to flee with 4,000 men eastwards. He marched towards Nishapur, where he defeated a pursuing army as well as an army led by a Karenid nobleman at Qumis. Constantly troubled, he crossed the Oxus river, where he was received honorably by the Khagan of the Turks, who was most likely Birmudha—the same Turkic prince that Bahram Chobin had defeated and captured a few years earlier during his wars against the Turks. Bahram Chobin entered his service, and was appointed as a commander in the army, achieving further military accomplishments there. Bahram Chobin became a highly popular figure after saving the Khagan from a conspiracy instigated by the latter&#x27;s brother Byghu (conceivably an incorrect translation of &quot;yabghu&quot;). Khosrow II, however, could not feel safe as long as Bahram Chobin lived, and succeeded in having him assassinated. The assassination was reportedly achieved through distribution of presents and bribes between the members of the Turkic royal family, notably the queen. What remained of Bahram Chobin&#x27;s supporters went back to northern Iran and joined the rebellion of Vistahm (590/1–596 or 594/5–600).

==Consolidation of the empire==
===Domestic affairs and relations with the Byzantines===
With Khosrow&#x27;s rule now restored, his aim was to now consolidate his grip over his realm, which included showing tolerance and support to his Christian subjects. His wife Shirin—a Christian from Khuzestan—was the most influential of his wives, playing an important role in the royal favour that the Mesopotamian Christians enjoyed. She had a church and monastery constructed near the palace in Ctesiphon, which was used to receive a portion of the treasury for the wages of the clergy and their vestments. The Arab Lakhmids/Nasrids, a client state located at al-Hira and its surroundings, could now openly convert to Nestorian Christianity without angering the Sasanian court.

The Iranians and the Byzantines enjoyed good relations with each other for the first eleven years. This was apparent in their management of the issues that had risen in Armenia. In the 590s, many Armenian nobles and their supporters sought asylum in Iran to avoid being conscripted for Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns. The open borders between the two empires meant that nobles could freely immigrate to Iran and get promoted. However, when they showed signs of aspiring to fight the Byzantines, the Iranians worked together with the Byzantines to deal with the issue.

===Revolt of Vistahm===
After his victory, Khosrow rewarded his uncles with high positions: Vinduyih became treasurer and first minister and Vistahm received the post of &quot;spahbed&quot; of the East, encompassing Tabaristan and Khorasan, which was the traditional homeland of the Ispahbudhan. Soon, however, Khosrow changed his intentions: trying to disassociate himself from his father&#x27;s murder, he decided to execute his uncles. The Sasanian monarchs&#x27; traditional mistrust of over-powerful magnates and Khosrow&#x27;s personal resentment of Vinduyih&#x27;s patronising manner certainly contributed to this decision. Vinduyih was soon put to death, according to a Syriac source captured while trying to flee to his brother in the East.

At the news of his brother&#x27;s murder, Vistahm rose in open revolt. According to Dinawari, Vistahm sent a letter to Khosrow announcing his claim to the throne through his Parthian (Arsacid) heritage: &quot;You are not worthier to rule than I am. Indeed, I am more deserving on account of my descent from Darius, son of Darius, who fought Alexander. You Sasanians deceitfully gained superiority over us [the Arsacids] and usurped our right, and treated us with injustice. Your ancestor Sasan was no more than a shepherd.&quot; Vistahm&#x27;s revolt, like Bahrams&#x27;s shortly before, found support and spread quickly. Local magnates as well as the remnants of Bahram Chobin&#x27;s armies flocked to him, especially after he married Bahram&#x27;s sister Gordiya. Vistahm repelled several loyalist efforts to subdue him, and he soon held sway in the entire eastern and northern quadrants of the Iranian realm, a domain stretching from the Oxus river to the region of Ardabil in the west. He even campaigned in the east, where he subdued two Hephthalite princes of Transoxiana, Shaug and Pariowk. The date of Vistahm&#x27;s uprising is uncertain. From his coinage, it is known that his rebellion lasted for seven years. The commonly accepted dates are ca. 590–596, but some scholars like J. D. Howard-Johnston and Parvaneh Pourshariati push its outbreak later, in 594/5, to coincide with the Armenian Vahewuni rebellion.

As Vistahm began to threaten Media, Khosrow sent several armies against his uncle, but failed to achieve a decisive result: Vistahm and his followers retreated to the mountainous region of Gilan, while several Armenian contingents of the royal army rebelled and defected to Vistahm. Finally, Khosrow called upon the services of the Armenian Smbat Bagratuni, who engaged Vistahm near Qumis. During the battle, Vistahm was murdered by Pariowk at Khosrow&#x27;s urging (or, according to an alternative account, by his wife Gordiya). Nevertheless, Vistahm&#x27;s troops managed to repel the royal army at Qumis, and it required another expedition by Smbat in the next year to finally end the rebellion.

=== Abolition of the Lakhmid dynasty ===
In 600, Khosrow II executed Al-Nu&#x27;man III, King of the Lakhmids of Al-Hira, presumably because of the Arab king&#x27;s refusal to give him his daughter al-Ḥurqah in marriage and insulting Persian women. Afterwards the central government took over the defense of the western frontiers to the desert, and the buffer state of the Lakhmids vanished. This ultimately facilitated the Muslim Caliphs&#x27; invasion and conquest of Lower Iraq, less than a decade after Khosrow&#x27;s death.

== Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 ==
=== Initial Iranian invasion and dominance ===

Toward the beginning of his reign, Khosrow II had good relations with the Byzantines. However, when in 602 Emperor Maurice was murdered by his General Phocas (602–610), who usurped the Roman (Byzantine) throne, Khosrow launched an offensive against Constantinople: ostensibly to avenge Maurice&#x27;s death, but his aim clearly included the annexation of as much Byzantine territory as was feasible. Khosrow II, along with Shahrbaraz and his other best generals, quickly captured Dara and Edessa in 604, and recaptured lost territory in the north, which made the Sasanian–Byzantine borders go back to the pre-591 frontier before Khosrow gave Maurice territory in return for military aid against Bahram Chobin. After having reclaimed lost territory, Khosrow withdrew from the battlefield and handed military operations to Shahrbaraz and Shahin Vahmanzadegan. The Sasanian armies then invaded and plundered Syria and Asia Minor, and in 608 advanced into Chalcedon.

In 610, Heraclius revolted against Phocas and killed him, crowning himself as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. He then tried to negotiate peace with Khosrow II by sending diplomats to his court. Khosrow, however, rejected their offer and said: &quot;That kingdom belongs to me, and I shall enthrone Maurice&#x27;s son, Theodosius, as emperor. [As for Heraclius], he went and took the rule without our order and now offers us our own treasure as gifts. But I shall not stop until I have him in my hands.&quot; Khosrow then had the diplomats executed.

In 613 and 614, General Shahrbaraz besieged and captured Damascus and Jerusalem, and the True Cross was carried away in triumph. Soon afterwards, Shahin marched through Anatolia, defeating the Byzantines numerous times; he conquered Egypt in 618. The Byzantines could offer but little resistance, as they were torn apart by internal dissensions, and pressed by the Avars and Slavs, who were invading the Empire from across the Danube River. In 622/3, Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell to the Sasanians, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.

=== Turko-Hephthalite invasion ===
In ca. 606/607, Khosrow recalled Smbat IV Bagratuni from Sasanian Armenia and sent him to repel the Turko-Hephthalites, who had raided as far as Spahan in central Iran. Smbat, with the aid of an Iranian prince named Datoyean, repelled the Turko-Hephthalites from Iran, and plundered their domains in eastern Khorasan, where Smbat is said to have killed their king in single combat. Khosrow then gave Smbat the honorific title &quot;Khosrow Shun&quot; (&quot;the Joy or Satisfaction of Khosrow&quot;), while his son Varaztirots II Bagratuni received the honorific name &quot;Javitean Khosrow&quot; (&quot;Eternal Khosrow&quot;).

Sebeos describes the event as:

=== Byzantine counter-offensive and resurgence ===

In 622, despite the major progress the Sasanians were making in the area of the Aegean Sea, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius was able to take the field with a powerful force. In 624, he advanced into northern Adurbadagan, where he was welcomed by Farrukh Hormizd and his son Rostam Farrokhzad who had rebelled against Khosrow. Heraclius then began sacking several cities and temples, including the Adur Gushnasp temple.

In 626 Heraclius captured Lazistan (Colchis). Later that same year, Shahrbaraz advanced on Chalcedon on the Bosphoros and attempted to capture Constantinople with the help of Avar and Slavic allies. In this siege of Constantinople in 626, the combined Sassanid, Slavic and Avar forces failed to capture the Byzantine capital city. The Avars did not have the patience or technology to conquer the city. On top of that, the Iranians, who were siege warfare experts, were unable to transport their troops and equipment to the other side of the Bosphorus where their Slavic and Avar allies were located, due to heavy guarding of the strait by the Byzantine navy. Furthermore, the walls of Constantinople were easily defended against the siege towers and engines. Another reason was that the Persians and Slavs did not have a strong enough navy to skirt the sea walls and establish a channel of communication. The lack of supplies for the Avars eventually caused them to abandon the siege. As this maneuver failed, Shahrbaraz&#x27; forces were defeated, and he withdrew his army from Anatolia later in 628.

Following the Third Perso-Turkic War in 627, Heraclius defeated the Iranian army at the Battle of Nineveh and advanced towards Ctesiphon. Khosrow II fled from his favorite residence, Dastagird (near Ctesiphon), without offering resistance. Heraclius then captured Dastagird and plundered it.

=== Overthrow and death ===

After the capture of Dastagird, the son of Khosrow, Sheroe, was released by the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, which included the Ispahbudhan &quot;spahbed&quot; Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad. Shahrbaraz of the Mihran family, the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni, and finally Kanadbak of the Kanārangīyān family. On the night of 25 February, the night-watch of the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon, which would usually shout the name of the reigning shah, shouted the name of Sheroe instead, which indicated a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was taking place. Sheroe, with Aspad Gushnasp leading his army, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II in the house of a certain Mehr-Sepand (also known as Maraspand). Sheroe, who had now assumed the dynastic name of Kavad II, then ordered Aspad Gushnasp to lead the charge of accusations against the deposed shah. Khosrow, however, dismissed all accusations one by one.

Kavad shortly proceeded to have all his brothers and half-brothers executed, including the heir Mardanshah, who was Khosrow&#x27;s favourite son. The murder of all his brothers, &quot;all well-educated, valiant, and chivalrous men&quot;, stripped the Sasanian dynasty of a future competent ruler, and has been described as a &quot;mad rampage&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot;. Three days later he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute Khosrow. However, after the regicide of his father, Kavad also proceeded to have Mihr Hormozd killed. Khosrow&#x27;s daughters Boran and Azarmidokht reportedly criticized and scolded Kavad for his barbaric actions, which made him filled with remorse. With the support of the Iranian nobles, Kavad then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, which made the Byzantines regain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.

Due to Kavad&#x27;s actions, his reign is seen as a turning point in Sasanian history, and has been argued by some scholars as playing a key role in the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The overthrow and death of Khosrow culminated in a chaotic civil war, with the most powerful members of the nobility gaining full autonomy and starting to create their own government. The hostilities between the Persian (&quot;Parsig&quot;) and Parthian (&quot;Pahlav&quot;) noble-families were also resumed, which split up the wealth of the nation. The civil war finally ended when Khosrow&#x27;s eight year old grandson, Yazdegerd III, ascended the throne. The young king, however, inherited a disintegrating empire, which was dealt its last blow in 651 during the Arab conquest of Iran.

== Religious policy and beliefs ==
Khosrow II, like all other Sasanian rulers, was an adherent of Zoroastrianism. Since the 5th century, the Sasanian monarchs had been made aware of the significance of the religious minorities in the realm, and as a result tried to integrate them into a structure of administration where, according to legal principles, all would be treated straightforwardly as / , i.e. &quot;man/woman [citizen] of the country&quot;. Jews and Christians (but not the persecuted Manichaeans) had accepted the concept of &quot;Eranshahr&quot; / &quot;Iran&quot; (which had once been inextricable from Zoroastrianism) and considered themselves part of it.

During his reign there was constant conflict between Monophysite and Nestorian Christians. Khosrow favored the Monophysites, and ordered all his subjects to adhere to Monophysitism, perhaps under the influence of Shirin and the royal physician Gabriel of Sinjar, who both supported this faith. Khosrow also dispensed money or gifts to Christian shrines. Khosrow&#x27;s great tolerance to Christianity and friendship with the Christian Byzantines even made some Armenian writers think that Khosrow was a Christian. His positive policy toward Christians (which, however, was probably politically motivated) made him unpopular with the Zoroastrian priests, and also made Christianity greatly spread around the Sasanian Empire. In 591, at the beginning of his reign, Byzantine-Sasanian negotiations resulted in an edict of toleration, based on the understanding that proselytization would be banned. According to Nina Garsoïan, Khosrow &quot;returned to the normal pattern of alternate toleration and repression&quot; of Christians after the death of his ally Maurice in 602. While individual Christians continued to enjoy his favor, a number of prominent Christian officials and prelates were put to death during this period. During Khosrow&#x27;s war with the Byzantines, Christian elites and organizations were incorporated into the Sasanian system, as part of his attempt to absorb the Byzantine realm into his expanded empire. The condition of the Christian nobility reached its pinnacle under Khosrow. Mushegh II Mamikonian, a prominent Armenian &quot;nakharar&quot;, is the first and only Christian nobleman that is praised by courtly historiographers, due to his rejection of the enticements of Bahram Chobin. His decision to choose Khosrow over his native Armenia, gained him a place in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the national epic of Iran. Smbat IV Bagratuni likewise led an illustrious career under Khosrow, rising to the office of frontier commander of Gurgan, possibly the most vital and contested area of the Sasanian realm. As a reward for his accomplishments in the east, Smbat was appointed the leader of the military jurisdiction in the Caucasus. Furthermore, his aristocratic house – the Bagratunis – was made the pillar of Sasanian authority in the area.

Khosrow also paid attention to the Zoroastrians, and had various fire temples constructed. However, this did not help the Zoroastrian church, which was in a heavy decline during his reign. According to Richard N. Frye, the Zoroastrian church under Khosrow &quot;was noted for its devotion to luxury more than its devotion to thought.&quot;

== Music during the reign of Khosrow II ==
Khosrow II&#x27;s reign was considered a golden age in music. Before Khosrow II there were many other Sasanian kings that showed particular interest in music, like Khosrow I, Bahram Gur, and even Ardashir I. Notable musicians during the reign of Khosrow II were Barbad (Khosrow&#x27;s favorite court musician), Bamshad, Sarkash, and Nagisa.

== Rock reliefs ==

Khosrow restored the practice of erecting rock reliefs, after an absence of nearly three centuries, the last one being erected under Shapur III (). At Taq-e Bostan, Khosrow mimicked and magnified the rock relief of Shapur III. His relief, known as the &quot;Great Ayvan&quot;, is in a barrel vault carved in a cliff. The ayvan is split into an upper and lower section; the upper section depicts a divine investiture scene, with the Zoroastrian divinities Ahura Mazda and Anahita each giving Khosrow a diadem. The lower section depicts Khosrow II on horseback, wearing full body armor, whilst holding a lance and shield. His head is encircled by a halo, which according to Howard-Johnston, is most likely a representation of his &quot;xwarrah&quot;, i.e. kingly glory. On the left side panel, a boar hunt scene is depicted, portraying Khosrow on a boat whilst aiming a bow. On the right, there is a deer hunt scene. The relief, however, is unfinished, probably due to Khosrow&#x27;s setback in the later stages of the war and his eventual downfall.

== Coinage ==

Khosrow, during his second reign, added the ideogram GDH, meaning &quot;xwarrah&quot; (&quot;royal splendor&quot;) on his coins. He combined this together with the word &quot;abzōt&quot; (&quot;he has increased&quot;), making the full inscription thus read as: &quot;Khosrow, he has increased the royal splendor&quot; (&quot;Khūsrōkhwarrah abzōt&quot;). The title of King of Kings–missing since the reign of Peroz I ()–was also restored on his coins. According to Shayegan, Khosrow&#x27;s adoption of the title was &quot;undoubtedly a consequence of his Byzantine policy,&quot; and was signifying a resurrection of the ancient Achaemenid Empire. His two successors, Kavad II () and Ardashir III (), refrained from using the title, seemingly in order distance themselves from him.

== Khosrow II in Islamic tradition ==
Islamic tradition tells a story in which Khosrow II (in &quot;Kisra&quot;) was a Persian king to whom Muhammad had sent a messenger, Abdullah ibn Hudhafah as-Sahmi, along with a letter in which Khosrow was asked to preach the religion of Islam. The account as transmitted by Muslim tradition reads:

Islamic tradition further states that Khosrow II tore up Muhammad&#x27;s letter saying, &quot;A pitiful slave among my subjects dares write his name before mine&quot; and commanded Badhan, his vassal ruler of Yemen, to dispatch two valiant men to identify, seize and bring this man from Hijaz (Muhammad) to him. When Abdullah ibn Hudhafah as-Sahmi told Muhammad how Khosrow had torn his letter to pieces, Muhammad promised the destruction of Khosrow II stating, &quot;Even so, Allah shall destroy his kingdom.&quot; Later, Badhan&#x27;s men arrived in Medina and talked to Muhammad, ordering him to accompany them back to Khosrow II. Muhammad reportedly changed the subject, made it obvious he did not like their appearance, and responded by asking why they shave their beards and leave their mustaches to grow and be that large. When they said that&#x27;s what their god orders them to do, he said his god orders him to cut his mustache and grow his beard. After he took control of the conversation like that, he went back on-topic and asked them to come back to him the next day. When they did, he informed them that Khosrow II had been killed by his son. Badhan&#x27;s men responded angrily, threatening Muhammad to tell Badhan what he is saying about Khosrow II. To that, he responded by encouraging them to write to Badhan and to also tell him that Islam and its power will reach all that Khosrow II has ever ruled over. A few days later, Badhan received confirmation from Persia that Khosrow II was dead. As a consequence, he is said to have accepted Islam, and Muhammad kept him as a ruler over his people.

== In art ==

The battles between Heraclius and Khosrow are depicted in a famous early Renaissance fresco by Piero della Francesca, part of the &quot;History of the True Cross&quot; cycle in the church of San Francesco, Arezzo. Many Persian miniature paintings depict events in his life, like his battles or his assassination.

== Family ==
Khosrow was the son of Hormizd IV and an unnamed Ispahbudhan noblewoman who was the sister of Vistahm and Vinduyih. Khosrow also had two cousins from the Ispahbudhan family who were named Mah-Adhur Gushnasp and Narsi. He had a brother-in-law named Hormuzan, a Sasanian nobleman from one of the seven Parthian clans, who later fought against the Arabs during the Muslim invasion of Persia.

Of Khosrow&#x27;s wives, the Christian Shirin played the most prominent public role. She bore Khosrow a son, Mardanshah, and unsuccessfully tried to secure the succession for him. Another one of Khosrow&#x27;s wives was Maria, which some sources depict as the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Maurice. However, this identification is generally not accepted by scholars. Maria may have been a Greek girl in Khosrow&#x27;s harem, later remembered as a Byzantine princess. Maria was the mother of Khosrow&#x27;s successor Kavad II. The 9th-century historian Dinawari claims that Khosrow married Gordiya, the sister of Bahram Chobin, after the latter&#x27;s death, and that Gordiya bore him a son named Javanshir. Javanshir is supposed to have ruled before Khosrow&#x27;s daughter Borandukht, but he is not represented in Sasanian coinage. Khosrow also had other children: daughters Borandukht and Azarmidokht and sons Shahriyar and Farrukhzad Khosrow V. All these persons except Shahriyar would later become the monarch of Iran during the Sasanian civil war of 628–632. Khosrow had a sister who was married to the Sasanian &quot;spahbed&quot; Shahrbaraz and bore him Shapur-i Shahrvaraz. She was called Mihran because she had married into the House of Mihran.

<text>Hormizd-Ardashir, better known by his dynastic name of Hormizd I (also spelled Hormozd I or Ohrmazd I; ), was the third Sasanian King of Kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) of Iran, who ruled from May 270 to June 271. He was the third-born son of Shapur I (), under whom he was governor-king of Armenia, and also took part in his father&#x27;s wars against the Roman Empire. Hormizd I&#x27;s brief time as ruler of Iran was largely uneventful. He built the city of Hormizd-Ardashir (present-day Ahvaz), which remains a major city today in Iran. He promoted the Zoroastrian priest Kartir to the rank of chief priest (&quot;mowbed&quot;) and gave the Manichaean prophet Mani permission to continue his preaching.

It was under Hormizd I that the title of &quot;King of Kings of Iran and non-Iran&quot; became regularized in Sasanian coinage; previously, the royal titulary had generally been &quot;King of Kings of Iran&quot;. Hormizd I was succeeded by his eldest brother Bahram I.

== Etymology ==
The name of Hormizd (also spelled &quot;Ōhrmazd&quot;, &quot;Hormozd&quot;) is the Middle Persian version of the name of the supreme deity in Zoroastrianism, known in Avestan as Ahura Mazda. The Old Persian equivalent is &quot;Auramazdā&quot;, whilst the Greek transliteration is &quot;Hormisdas&quot;. The name is attested in Armenian as &quot;Ormizd&quot; and in Georgian as &quot;Urmizd&quot;. His personal name was &quot;Hormizd-Ardashir&quot;, a combination of &quot;Hormizd&quot; and &quot;Ardashir&quot;, the latter being the Middle Persian form of the Old Persian &quot;Ṛtaxšira&quot; (also spelled &quot;Artaxšaçā&quot;), meaning &quot;whose reign is through truth (asha)&quot;.

== Background ==
Hormizd was the third-born son of Shapur I (). According to folklore, Hormizd&#x27;s mother was a daughter of the Parthian dynast Mihrak. His two elder brothers were Bahram (the eldest) and Shapur Meshanshah, whilst Narseh was his younger brother. Hormizd had two sisters named Adur-Anahid and Shapurdukhtak. His grandfather was Ardashir I, the founder of the Sasanian Empire. The Sasanians had supplanted the Arsacid Empire as the sovereigns of Iran in 224, when Ardashir I defeated and killed the last Arsacid King of Kings Artabanus IV () at the Battle of Hormozdgan.

== Rise ==

Hormizd is first mentioned during the wars of Shapur I against the Roman Empire. He was made the king of Armenia after its conquest by Shapur I in 252. Hormizd is believed to be many modern historians to have taken part in Shapur I&#x27;s second Roman expedition, which took place in the Roman provinces of Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, and which lasted from 253 to 256. This is supported by the reports of the Cappadocian conquests. Cappadocia does not appear to have been the only area that Hormizd fought in: according to the &quot;Scriptores Historiae Augustae&quot;, the Roman rebel Cyriades assisted Shapur I and a certain Odomastes in the conquest of Antioch. The name &quot;Odomastes&quot; is an incorrect transliteration of Hormizd, and may thus suggest that after plundering Cappadocia, Hormizd took part in the siege of Antioch in 253. 

Hormizd is mentioned in an inscription on the wall of the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht at Naqsh-e Rostam near Persepolis in southern Iran, which Shapur I had created in order to praise his sons by citing their names and titles. In the inscription, Hormizd is given the title of &quot;Wuzurg Šāh Arminān&quot; (&quot;Great King of the Armenians&quot;). The 4th-century Armenian historian Agathangelos states that this title was only given to the heir of the &quot;shahanshah&quot;.

When Shapur I was on his deathbed, he crowned Hormizd as the new &quot;shahanshah&quot; of Iran, in May 270.

== Reign ==
Little is known of Hormizd&#x27;s reign. He reportedly gave the Zoroastrian priest Kartir clothes that were worn by the upper class, the cap and belt (&quot;kulāf ud kamarband&quot;) and appointed him as the chief priest (&quot;mowbed&quot;). Like his father, Hormizd also granted the Manichaean prophet Mani permission to continue his preaching. It is unclear why Hormizd supported Kartir and Mani, both of whom represented a different religion. The Iranologist Touraj Daryaee has suggested that it was possibly part of his attempt to control both religions, which were both seeking to become the main religion in the empire. According to the Iranologist Prods Oktor Skjaervo, Hormizd was like his two predecessors, a &quot;lukewarm Zoroastrian&quot;. Hormizd is usually given the epithet of &quot;nēw&quot; or &quot;yaxī/yaxē&quot; (both meaning &quot;brave&quot;) in Manichean Middle Iranian sources, possibly indicating his accomplishments in warfare. It was seemingly under Hormizd that the two New Year festivals (Nowruz) in the month of Farwardin were linked together to design a festival that lasted six days. In primary sources, Hormizd is credited as the founder of the city of Hormizd-Ardashir (present-day Ahvaz), however, in some instances Ardashir I is also attributed as its founder. Modern historians (citing &quot;Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr&quot;) usually consider Hormizd to be its actual founder. He also founded the city of Ram-Hormizd-Ardashir (meaning &quot;Ardashir&#x27;s peace of Hormizd&quot;), abbreviated as Ram-Hormizd. He refounded the city of Artemita as Dastagird, whose royal residence would later serve as an important place for the &quot;shahanshahs&quot; Khosrow I () and Khosrow II (). Hormizd was not succeeded by his son Hormozdak, but by his brother Bahram (who became known as Bahram I), who ascended the throne with the aid of Kartir. According to local folklore, Hormizd was buried in Ram-Hormizd.

== Coinage and imperial ideology ==

While Ardashir I and Shapur I generally used the title of &quot;King of Kings of (Iran)ians&quot; on their coinage, Hormizd had the title slightly modified, adding the phrase &quot;and non-Iran(ians)&quot;. His full title thus read &quot;the Mazda-worshiping, divine Hormizd, King of Kings of Iran(ians) and non-Iran(ians), whose image/brilliance is from the gods&quot;. The phrase &quot;and non-Iran(ians)&quot; had already been in use in the inscriptions of Shapur I, and in rare cases his coin mints, but was first regularized under Hormizd. The extended title demonstrates the incorporation of new territory into the empire, however what was precisely seen as &quot;non-Iran(ian)&quot; (&quot;aneran&quot;) is not certain. The reverse of Hormizd&#x27;s coin portrayed two attendants, an addition that was first made by Shapur I, on whose coinage both attendants are depicted wearing mural crowns, whilst looking away from the fire temple between them. They most likely represented the shah. In the coinage of Hormizd, the attendants face the temple and are wearing different crowns. The figure on the left side represents Hormizd, whilst the figure on the right—depending on its portrayal—represents the Iranian deities Mithra or Anahita.

<text>Hormizd II (also spelled Hormozd or Ohrmazd; ) was king (shah) of the Sasanian Empire. He ruled for six years and five months, from 303 to 309. He was a son and successor of Narseh ().

During his reign, the Kingdom of Armenia had recently declared Christianity as its official religion, thus leaving its ancient Zoroastrian heritage that it shared with Sasanian Iran. Hormizd II&#x27;s reign was also marked by internal turmoil, which he successfully managed to deal with. Hormizd II was also successful in his efforts in the west, defeating and killing the Ghassanid king in Syria. His reign was, however, cut short by the intrigues of the Iranian nobility, who killed him in a secluded place.

He was succeeded by his son Adur Narseh, who after a few months of reigning was also killed by the nobility. They instead installed Hormizd II&#x27;s infant son Shapur II on the throne.

== Etymology ==
The name of Hormizd (also spelled &quot;Ōhrmazd&quot;, &quot;Hormozd&quot;) is the Middle Persian version of the name of the supreme deity in Zoroastrianism, known in Avestan as Ahura Mazda. The Old Persian equivalent is &quot;Auramazdā&quot;, while the Greek transliteration is &quot;Hormisdas&quot;. The name is attested in Armenian as &quot;Ormizd&quot; and in Georgian as &quot;Urmizd&quot;.

==Life==
=== Background ===

When Hormizd&#x27;s father Narseh ascended the throne in 293, he had an investiture relief made in Naqsh-e Rostam, where he is depicted as receiving the ring of kingship from a female figure that is frequently assumed to be the goddess Anahita. However, some scholars have suggested that this may be his wife and Hormizd&#x27;s mother, Shapurdukhtak. The figure standing behind Narseh is most likely Hormizd, due to his cap being the form of that of an animal protome, which was typically worn by Sasanian heirs. Hormizd most likely did not take part in his father&#x27;s war against the Roman Empire, which ended disastrously for the Sasanians, with Narseh&#x27;s wife and some of his offspring being captured, forcing him to surrender a handful provinces in Armenia and Mesopotamia in order to have his family members handed back to him. Hormizd may have been same person as Hormizd II Kushanshah, a Sasanian prince who briefly ruled the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom from 300 to 303. They both minted coins where they were depicted with a winged crown, whilst on the reverse, which usually shows the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants, also shows a head emerging from the fire, a typical Kushano-Sasanian design which first appears on Sasanian coins during the reign of Hormizd II.

===Reign===
In 303, Hormizd II ascended the throne, assuming a crown whose features resembled that of the same used by the early Sasanian rulers, such as Bahram II (). Not much is known about the reign of Hormizd; he supposedly started out as a cruel ruler but then became benevolent.

This change of behaviour is described by al-Tabari;

However, he persecuted the Manicheans, who had lived peacefully in the reign of his father; Narseh followed a policy of religious tolerance in emulation of the first two shahs, Ardashir I () and Shapur I (). Hormizd reportedly founded the rural district of Kurang (or Wahisht-Hormozd) near Izeh in the Khuzistan province. He gave his daughter Hormizddukht in marriage to a Mamikonian prince named Vahan as part of an effort to improve Sasanian relations with Armenia, which had recently under Tiridates III of Armenia declared Christianity as its state religion.

Hormizd&#x27;s rock relief at Naqsh-e Rostam in the Pars province (present-day Fars) indicates that there was internal turmoil during his reign. He is depicted on horseback, impaling an enemy whose helmet bears the family signature of Papak, a high-ranking nobleman who served as the (viceroy) of Albania during the reign of Bahram II and Narseh. During his last years Hormizd pursued hostilities against the Ghassanid king, demanding tribute and raiding Ghassanid domains in Syria. The Ghassanid king requested reinforcements from the Roman emperor, but was killed before they arrived. Hormizd died in 309, reportedly ambushed by Ghassanid troops whilst he was hunting in the desert. He was more likely killed in a secluded place by the Iranian nobility, who afterwards sought to get rid of his sons as well.

According to the 11th-century &quot;Chronicle of Seert&quot;, Hormizd declared war against the Romans in order to avenge the defeat of his father, whilst the Chronicle of Arbela states that when the Roman emperor started persecuting his Christian subjects, Hormizd raised a great army, invaded the Roman domains and raided many cities. The credibility of the two sources are doubtful, with the events not being reported in other sources. According to the Iranologist Alireza Shapour Shahbazi, &quot;one may only surmise that it is probably a reflection of Hormozd&#x27;s alleged raid into Syria.&quot;

==Succession==
After Hormizd&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his eldest son Adur Narseh, who, after a brief reign which lasted few months, was killed by some of the nobles of the empire. They then blinded the second, and imprisoned the third (Hormizd, who afterwards escaped to the Roman Empire). The throne was reserved for the unborn child of Hormizd II&#x27;s wife Ifra Hormizd, which was Shapur II. Shapur II was reportedly the only king in history to be crowned &quot;in utero&quot;, as the legend claims that the crown was placed upon his mother&#x27;s womb while she was pregnant. However, according to Shahbazi, it is unlikely that Shapur was crowned as king while still in his mother&#x27;s womb, since the nobles could not have known of his sex at that time. He further states that Shapur was born forty days after his father&#x27;s death, and that the nobles killed Adur Narseh and crowned Shapur II in order to gain greater control of the empire, which they were able to do until Shapur II reached his majority at the age of 16.

==Offspring==
Hormizd II was one of the Sasanian kings with the most children, which he had from his wife Ifra-Hormizd, and several other wives and concubines:
*Prince Adur Narseh (3rd century – 309), the ninth king of the Sasanian Empire.
*Prince Shapur II (309 – 379), the tenth king of the Sasanian Empire.
*Prince Adurfrazgird (??? – 4th century), governor of southern Arbayistan.
*Prince Zamasp (??? – 4th century), governor of northern Arbayistan.
*Prince Shapur Sakanshah (??? – 4th century), governor of Sakastan.
*Prince Hormizd (??? – 4th century), imprisoned by the Iranian nobility and later defected to the Roman Empire.
*Prince Ardashir II (309 – 383), the eleventh king of the Sasanian Empire.
*Prince Narseh (??? – 4th century), briefly occupied the Armenian throne in the mid-330s.
*Princess Hormizddukht (??? – 4th century), married the Mamikonian prince Vahan.

<text>Hormizd III (; New Persian: ), was the seventeenth king (shah) of the Sasanian Empire, ruling briefly from 457 to 459. He was the son and successor of Yazdegerd II (). His reign was marked by the rebellion of his younger brother Peroz I, who with the aid of one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, the House of Mihran, and the eastern neighbours of the Sasanians, the Hephthalites, had him captured and executed.

== Etymology ==
The name of Hormizd (also spelled &quot;Ōhrmazd&quot;, &quot;Hormozd&quot;) is the Middle Persian version of the name of the supreme deity in Zoroastrianism, known in Avestan as Ahura Mazda. The Old Persian equivalent is &quot;Auramazdā&quot;, whilst the Greek transliteration is &quot;Hormisdas&quot;. The name is attested in Armenian as &quot;Ormizd&quot; and in Georgian as &quot;Urmizd&quot;.

== Biography ==
Hormizd III was the eldest son and heir of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II, and governed the eastern province of Sakastan during his father&#x27;s reign. The province was far away from the imperial court in Ctesiphon, and had since its conquest by Ardashir I () been governed by Sasanian princes, who held title of &quot;sakanshah&quot; (&quot;king of the Saka&quot;). When Yazdegerd I died in 457, Hormizd ascended the throne at Ray. His younger brother Peroz I, with the support of the powerful Mihranid magnate Raham Mihran, fled to the northeastern part of the empire and began raising an army in order to claim the throne for himself. The empire thus fell into a dynastic struggle and became divided; the mother of the two brothers, Denag, temporarily ruled as regent of the empire from its capital, Ctesiphon. According to eastern sources, Peroz was more worthy for the throne than Hormizd, who is called unjust. Only the anonymous source known as the Codex Sprenger 30 describes Hormizd as the &quot;braver and better&quot;, whilst describing Peroz as &quot;more learned in religion&quot;.

The Arsacid ruler of Caucasian Albania, Vache II (), who was the nephew of the two brothers through his mother, and had been forced to convert to Zoroastrianism by Yazdegerd II, took advantage of the dispute by declaring independence and reverting to Christianity. Peroz later went to the domains of the Hephthalite monarch, who agreed to support him with soldiers in his struggle for the throne. In 459, Peroz, with Hephthalite and Mihranid assistance, led an army against Hormizd and defeated him. According to some sources, Hormizd was pardoned and spared by his brother. However, this is most likely a legend, due to being contradicted by other sources, which state Peroz had Hormizd and three members of his family killed. Peroz I afterwards fully incorporated Sakastan into the empire by appointing an aristocrat from the House of Karen as governor. Hormizd was thus the last person to wield the title of &quot;sakanshah&quot;. No coins minted during Hormizd&#x27;s reign has been found.

== Family ==
Hormizd was survived by his two daughters, who were:

* Balendukht, the wife of Vakhtang I, the ruler of Iberia. She bore the latter a son named Dachi.
* An unnamed daughter, who was the wife of Varsken, Viceroy of Gugark and later Caucasian Albania.

<doc id="140493" wikidata="Q315902" url="?curid=140493" title="Hormizd IV">
<text>Hormizd IV (also spelled Hormozd IV or Ohrmazd IV; ) was the Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 579 to 590. He was the son and successor of Khosrow I () and his mother was a Khazar princess.

During his reign, Hormizd IV had the high aristocracy and Zoroastrian priesthood slaughtered, whilst supporting the landed gentry (the &quot;dehqan&quot;). His reign was marked by constant warfare: to the west, he fought a long and indecisive war with the Byzantine Empire, which had been ongoing since the reign of his father; and to the east, the Iranian general Bahram Chobin successfully contained and defeated the Western Turkic Khaganate during the First Perso-Turkic War. It was also during Hormizd IV&#x27;s reign that the Chosroid dynasty of Iberia was abolished. After negotiating with the Iberian aristocracy and winning their support, Iberia was successfully incorporated into the Sasanian Empire.

Jealous of Bahram&#x27;s success in the east, Hormizd IV had him disgraced and dismissed, which led to a rebellion led by Bahram, which marked the start of the Sasanian civil war of 589–591. Another faction, led by two other dissatisfied nobles, Vistahm and Vinduyih, had Hormizd IV deposed and killed, and elevated his son Khosrow II as the new king (shah).

Hormizd IV was noted for his religious tolerance, declining appeals by the Zoroastrian priesthood to persecute the Christian population of the country. Contemporary sources generally considered him to be a tyrannical figure, due to his policies. Modern historiography presents a milder view of him, and considers him a well-meaning ruler who strived to continue his father&#x27;s policies, albeit overambitiously.

== Etymology ==
Hormizd (also spelled Ōhrmazd and Hormozd) is the Middle Persian version of the name of the supreme deity in Zoroastrianism, known in Avestan as Ahura Mazda. The Old Persian equivalent is Auramazdā, while the Greek transliteration is Hormisdas. The name is attested in Armenian as Ormizd and in Georgian as Urmizd.

== Ancestry ==

Hormizd was the son of Khosrow I, one of the most celebrated of the Sasanian shahs. Oriental sources and modern scholars have associated Hormizd&#x27;s maternal grandfather with Istemi, the khagan of the Turks, who allied himself with Khosrow I in to put an end to the Hephthalites, which the two allied powers accomplished at the Battle of Gol-Zarriun. Khosrow I was given the daughter of Istemi in marriage, who reportedly gave birth to Hormizd. Hormizd is thus called a &quot;Torkzad(a)&quot; in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, or &#x27;son of a Turk&#x27;. This is, however, rejected by the Iranologist Shapur Shahbazi, who called such a relationship a &quot;chronological difficulty&quot;, due to sources mentioning Hormizd being sent by his father to contain the threat posed by Istemi, following the division of Hephthalite territory between the Sasanians and Turks.

Historians consider it more plausible that Hormizd was born around 540: his son Khosrow II was thus born in . The 7th-century Armenian historian Sebeos called Hormizd&#x27;s mother a &quot;daughter of the khagan of the Turks&quot; and referred to her as Kayen, whilst Mas&#x27;udi called her Faqom, stating that she was the daughter of the ruler of the Khazars. Shahbazi supported the German orientalist Josef Markwart in his deduction that Hormizd&#x27;s maternal grandfather was the khagan of the Khazars (who are frequently called Turks in other sources), and that Sebeos had referred to Hormizd&#x27;s mother by her father&#x27;s name (or title). The medieval Iranian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh also mentioned Khosrow I and the Khazar king organizing to marry each other&#x27;s daughters. Hormizd was thus not only an offspring of the highly esteemed Khosrow I of the ruling family of Iran, but also belonged to a royal Turkic dynasty, which according to Sebeos &quot;made Hormizd even greater than his paternal ancestors and equally greater and wilder than his maternal relatives&quot;.

==Policies and personality==

Khosrow I, aware that Hormizd had showed himself as a leader of quality, appointed Hormizd as his heir. The decision was also politically motivated, due to Hormizd&#x27;s maternal line being of noble lineage, whilst the mothers of Khosrow I&#x27;s other sons were more lowly. Hormizd came to the throne in 579: according to the narratives included in the history of al-Tabari, Hormizd was well learned and full of good aspirations of kindness toward the poor and weak. He was seemingly less warlike than his predecessors, but was resolute enough to continue their reforms. He appears to have strived his best to continue the policies of his father—supporting the landed gentry (the &quot;dehqan&quot;) against the aristocracy and protecting the rights of the lower classes, as well as thwarting efforts by the Zoroastrian priesthood to reassert themselves. He did, however, resort to executions in order to maintain his father&#x27;s policies, and as a result became the subject of hostility by the Zoroastrians. He declined an appeal by the priesthood to persecute the Christian population by asserting his wish that &quot;all his subjects were to exercise their religion freely&quot;. He reportedly had many members of the priesthood killed, including the chief priest (&quot;mowbed&quot;) himself.

He strained his relationship with the aristocracy by having thousands of them killed. Many had been distinguished figures under Hormizd&#x27;s father, such as the latter&#x27;s famous minister (wuzurg framadar) Bozorgmehr; the military commander (&quot;spahbed&quot;) of Khwarasan, Chihr-Burzen; the &quot;spahbed&quot; of &quot;Nemroz&quot;, Bahram-i Mah Adhar; the distinguished dignitary Izadgushasp; the &quot;spahbed&quot; of the southwest (Khwarwaran), Shapur, an Ispahbudhan nobleman who was the father of Vistahm; Vinduyih; and an unnamed daughter whom Hormizd had married. Hormizd was himself related to the family, with his paternal grandmother being a sister of Bawi, the father of Shapur. Hormizd was not the first Sasanian shah to kill a close relative from the Ispahbudhan family: his father Khosrow I had ordered the execution of Bawi in the early 530s. Nevertheless, the Ispahbudhans continued to enjoy such a high status that they were acknowledged as &quot;kin and partners of the Sasanians&quot;, with Vistahm being appointed as the successor of his father by Hormizd.

Due to his persecutions against the nobility and clergy, Hormizd thus became viewed with hostility in Persian sources. This was not unusual: the 5th-century Sasanian ruler Yazdegerd I is portrayed very negatively in Persian sources due to his tolerant policy towards his non-Zoroastrian subjects, and his refusal to comply with the demands of the aristocracy and priesthood, thus becoming known as the &quot;sinner&quot;. Although met with hostility in medieval sources, Hormizd is portrayed in a more positive light in modern sources. The German orientalist Theodor Nöldeke deemed the negative portrayal of Hormizd as unreasonable, and considered the shah to be &quot;a well-meaning sovereign who intended to restrain the nobility and clergy and ease the burden of the lower classes: his effort was on the whole justified, but the unhappy outcome shows that he was not the man to reach such lofty goals with peace and competence&quot;. The modern historian Michael Bonner states that &quot;the Persian royal tradition has covered Hurmazd in opprobrium, and the principal features of his reign have been deformed.&quot;

==War against the Byzantines==

From his father, Hormizd had inherited an ongoing war against the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Negotiations of peace had just begun with the Emperor Tiberius II, who offered to give up all claims to Armenia and interchange the Byzantine-occupied Arzanene for the Iranian-occupied Dara (which was an important Byzantine stronghold). Hormizd, however, further demanded the payment of the yearly tribute that was made during the reign of Justinian I (), and thus caused the negotiations to be broken off. No campaign in Mesopotamia was undertaken by either of the empires due to the negotiations, however they continued to clash in Armenia, where Varaz Vzur succeeded Tamkhosrow as the new Sasanian governor of Armenia.

The Byzantines were successful at their endeavors, securing a noteworthy victory under the commanders Cours and John Mystacon, albeit also suffering a defeat at the hands of the Sasanians. In early 580, the clients and vassals of the Sasanians, the Lakhmids, were defeated at the hands of the Ghassanids, vassals of the Byzantines. In the same year, a Byzantine army ravaged Garamig ud Nodardashiragan, reaching as far as Media. Around the same time, Bakur III, the Sasanian client king of Iberia, died, leaving behind two sons who were underage. Hormizd took advantage of the situation by abolishing the Iberian monarchy, i.e. the Chosroid dynasty. He appointed his son Khosrow as the governor of Caucasian Albania, who negotiated with the Iberian aristocracy and won their support, so successfully incorporating the country into the Sasanian Empire.

The following year (581), an ambitious campaign by the Byzantine commander Maurice, supported by Ghassanid forces under al-Mundhir III, targeted the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. The combined force moved south along the river Euphrates, accompanied by a fleet of ships. The army stormed the fortress of Anatha and moved on until it reached the region of Beth Aramaye in central Mesopotamia, near Ctesiphon. There they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Iranians. In response to Maurice&#x27;s advance, the Iranian general Adarmahan was ordered to operate in northern Mesopotamia, threatening the Byzantine army&#x27;s supply line. Adarmahan raided Osrhoene, and was successful in capturing its capital, Edessa. He then marched his army toward Callinicum on the Euphrates. With the possibility of a march to Ctesiphon gone, Maurice was forced to retreat. The retreat was arduous for the tired army, and Maurice and al-Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition&#x27;s failure. However, they cooperated in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw, and defeated him at Callinicum.

Tiberius tried afterwards to renew negotiations by sending Zachariah to the frontier to meet Andigan. The negotiations broke off once more after Andigan attempted to pressurize him by drawing the attention of the nearby Iranian contingent led by Tamkhosrow. In 582, Tamkhosrow, along with Adarmahan, invaded Byzantine territory and headed for the town of Constantina. Maurice, who had been expecting and preparing for such an attack, fought the Iranians outside the city in June 582. The Iranian army suffered a heavy defeat, and Tamkhosrow was killed. Not long afterwards, the deteriorating physical condition of Tiberius forced Maurice to return immediately to Constantinople to assume the crown. Meanwhile, John Mystacon, who had replaced Maurice as the Commander of the East, attacked the Sasanians at the junction of the Nymphius and the Tigris, but was defeated by the Iranian general Kardarigan. 

In 583, the objective of the Iranian army was to recapture the fortress Aphumon, which had been seized by Maurice in 578. However, while they besieged the fortress, the Romans besieged Akbas, a newly constructed fortress east of the Nymphius and thus close to the Roman frontier. This diverted the attention of the Iranian soldiers at Aphumon, who went to relieve Akbas. By the end of year, however, the Romans had destroyed the fortress. Hormizd then sued for peace: in 584, an Iranian envoy arrived at Constantinople, while a Roman envoy arrived at Ctesiphon. The negotiations, however, broke off once again. Around the same time, Philippicus was appointed the new Commander of the East.

In 585, Kardarigan went on the offensive, besieging the Byzantine base of Monocarton. The siege failed, and he then marched north to Martyropolis, Philippicus&#x27;s base; after sacking the church of John the Baptist near the city, however, he returned to Iranian territory, most likely Armenia. In the spring of 586, Hormizd once again attempted to make peace, and sent Mahbod to negotiate with Philippicus at Amida. Negotiations, however, broke down once more after the Iranians demanded gold in exchange for peace. Not long after, an Iranian force—led by Kardarigan, Aphraates and Mahbod—suffered a heavy defeat against the Byzantines at the Battle of Solachon. The victory was followed by destructive raids into Corduene and Arbayistan. In the following year, the new commander of the east, Heraclius the Elder, captured three fortresses near Dara. The Iranians took advantage of the discord in the Roman army between 588 and 589, and managed to successfully occupy Martyropolis in 589 with the help of a turncoat Roman officer.

== Turkic incursions in the east ==

In 588, the Turkic Khagan Bagha Qaghan (known as Sabeh/Saba in Persian sources), together with his Hephthalite subjects, invaded the Sasanian territories south of the Oxus, where they attacked and routed the Sasanian soldiers stationed in Balkh. After conquering the city, they proceeded to take Talaqan, Badghis, and Herat. The invasion was a violation of the treaty that Khosrow I and the Khagan Istemi had agreed to, which set the Oxus as the boundary between the empires. In a council of war, Bahram Chobin of the Parthian Mihranid family was chosen to lead an army against them and was given the governorship of Khorasan. Bahram&#x27;s army, supposedly consisting of 12,000 hand-picked horsemen, ambushed a large army of Turks and Hephthalites in April 588, at the Battle of Hyrcanian Rock. By 589 he had repelled the Turks and entered Balkh triumphantly, where he captured the Turkic treasury and the golden throne of the Khagan. He then proceeded to cross the Oxus river and won a decisive victory over the Turks, personally killing Bagha Qaghan with an arrowshot. He managed to reach as far as Baykand, near Bukhara, and also contain an attack by the son of the deceased Khagan, Birmudha, whom Bahram had captured and sent to Ctesiphon. 

Birmudha was well received there by Hormizd, who forty days later had him sent back to Bahram with the order that the Turkic prince should get sent back to Transoxiana. The Sasanians now held suzerainty over the Sogdian cities of Chach and Samarkand, where Hormizd minted coins. This victory briefly made Iran the supreme power in Near East, a feat that was for a long time evoked in Persian stories. After Bahram&#x27;s great victory against the Turks he was sent to Caucasus to repel an invasion of nomads, possibly the Khazars, where he was victorious. He was once again made commander of the Sasanian forces against the Byzantines, and successfully defeated a Byzantine force in Georgia. However, he then suffered a minor defeat by a Byzantine army on the banks of the Aras. Hormizd, who was jealous of Bahram, used this defeat as an excuse to dismiss him from his office, and had him humiliated.

According to one source, Bahram was the subject of jealousy by others after his victory against the Turks. Hormizd&#x27;s minister Azen Gushnasp, who was reportedly jealous of Bahram, accused him of having kept the best part of the booty for himself and only sending a small part to Hormizd. According to other sources, it was Birmudha or the courtiers that raised Hormizd&#x27;s suspicion. Regardless, Hormizd could not tolerate the rising fame of Bahram, and thus had him disgraced and removed from office for supposedly having kept some of the booty for himself. Furthermore, Hormizd sent him a chain and a spindle to show that he considered him as a lowly slave &quot;as ungrateful as a woman&quot;. Enraged, Bahram, who was still in the east, rebelled against Hormizd. The version of Bahram rebelling after his defeat against the Byzantines was supported by Nöldeke in 1879. However, a source found ten years later confirmed Bahram&#x27;s rebellion took in fact place while he was still in the east.

== Civil war ==

Due to his noble status and great military knowledge, Bahram&#x27;s soldiers and many others joined the rebellion, which marked the start of the Sasanian civil war of 589–591. Bahram then appointed a new governor for Khorasan, and afterwards set for Ctesiphon. The legitimacy of the House of Sasan had been established in the credence that the halo of kingship, the &quot;xwarrah&quot;, was given to the first Sasanian shah, Ardashir I () and his family following the latter&#x27;s conquest of the Parthian Empire (also known as the Arsacids). This was now, however, disputed by Bahram, thus marking the first time in Sasanian history that a Parthian dynasty challenged the legitimacy of the Sasanian family by rebelling.

He started circulating rumours based on an extract from the Zoroastrian holy book &quot;Bundahishn&quot; that implied by the end of Zoroaster&#x27;s millennium, &quot;a man shall come from the frontiers of Kavulistan, with whom there will be glory, also of the royal family, whom they will name Kay Bahram; and all men will return with him, and he will rule even over India, Rome, and Turkistan, over all the frontiers.&quot; Indeed, the Sasanians had misidentified Zoroaster&#x27;s era with that of the Seleucids (312 BC), which put Bahram&#x27;s life almost at the end of Zoroaster&#x27;s millennium, he was therefore hailed by many as the promised savior Kay Bahram Varjavand. A verse in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; seemingly indicates that Bahram proclaimed himself as the personification of the fire of the sun god Mithra, and that he swore to restore the religion and traditions of his ancestors, the Arsacids.

Hormizd sent a force under Sarames the Elder to arrest Bahram. He was, however, defeated by the latter, who had him trampled to death by an elephant. The route taken by Bahram was presumably the northern edge of the Iranian plateau, where in 590 he had repelled a Byzantine-funded attack by Iberians and others on Adurbadagan, and suffered a minor setback by a Byzantine force employed in Transcaucasia. He then marched southwards Media, where Sasanian monarchs, including Hormizd, ordinarily resided during the summer. Hormizd then left for the Great Zab River in order to cut communications between Ctesiphon and the Iranian soldiers on the Byzantine border. Around that time the soldiers, who were situated outside Nisibis, the chief city in northern Mesopotamia, rebelled against Hormizd and pledged their allegiance to Bahram when reached the city.

The influence and popularity of Bahram continued to grow: Sasanian loyalist forces sent north against the Iranian rebels at Nisibis were flooded with rebel propaganda. The loyalist forces eventually also rebelled and killed their commander Chubriadanes, which made the position of Hormizd become unsustainable. He then sent an envoy to placate Bahram, while he started to make preparations to collect the royal treasure, destroy the bridge of the Tigris, and take sanctuary in al-Hira, the capital of the Lakhmids. A new Sasanian force was sent under the general Farrukhan to encounter Bahram. Shortly before the departure of the army, Hormizd had approved a request by Farrukhan. He had asked the king for the release of an aristocratic prisoner named Zadspram, whom he regarded as an important figure in his efforts against Bahram. The forces of Farrukhan and Bahram confronted each other at the Great Zab, but neither attacked, due to lack of confidence to cross the river. Farrukhan possibly hoped that the troops of Bahram would desert the latter; instead he was, however, deserted by Zadspram, and then eventually some of his officers, who murdered him.

=== Overthrow and death ===

Hormizd, during his stay at Ctesiphon, was overthrown in a seemingly bloodless palace revolution by his brothers-in-law Vistahm and Vinduyih, who according to the Syriac writer Joshua the Stylite, both &quot;equally hated Hormizd&quot;. They had Hormizd blinded with a red-hot needle, and put his oldest son Khosrow II (who was their nephew through his mother&#x27;s side) on the throne. On June, the two brothers strangled Hormizd to death with his own turban.

According to the 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, Khosrow II was involved in the murder of his father, while the 9th-century Muslim historian Abu Hanifa Dinawari, who based his account on the now lost Middle Persian work &quot;The Book of Bahram Chobin&quot;, does not involve Khosrow II. Sebeos, who was hostile to Khosrow II, likewise does not accuse him of patricide. Propaganda circulated by Bahram, however, condemned Khosrow II for the death of his father. The modern historian Michael Bonner is skeptical of Theophylact&#x27;s account, which he deems to have chronological issues. Bahram continued his march to Ctesiphon, now with the pretext of claiming to avenge Hormizd. Hormizd&#x27;s death continued to be a controversial matter—a few years later, Khosrow II ordered the execution of both his uncles as well as other nobles who had a hand in the killing of his father. A few decades later, Khosrow II, after being overthrown in a coup by his son Kavad II, was accused of regicide against his father.

== Religious policy and beliefs ==
Hormizd, like all other Sasanian rulers, was an adherent of Zoroastrianism. Since the 5th-century, the Sasanian monarchs had been made aware of the significance of the religious minorities in the realm, and as a result tried to homogenize them into a structure of administration where according to legal principles, all would be treated straightforwardly as &quot;mard / zan ī šahr&quot;, i.e. &quot;man/woman citizen (of the Empire)&quot;. Jews and (notably) Christians had accepted the concept of Iran and considered themselves part of the nation. Hormizd, aware of the importance of the Christians and their support, refused to attack them when asked by the Zoroastrian clergy, whom he reportedly urged to acknowledge the input of the Christians. According to al-Tabari&#x27;s &quot;History of Prophets and Kings&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle of Seert&quot;, which both drew some of their work from the Middle Persian history book &quot;Khwaday-Namag&quot; (&quot;Book of Lords&quot;), Hormizd told the clergy:

His tolerance towards the Christians earned him the gratitude of their priests, and the respect of the patriarch Ezekiel and his successor Ishoyahb I. Hormizd was himself married to a Christian woman and prayed to the martyr St. Sergius, a military saint whose cult rapidly increased beyond political and cultural borders from the 5th to the 7th-century. He was as a result suspected of harboring Christian beliefs. However, his son Khosrow II also paid tribute to Sergius, more than once. Hormizd superstitiously wore a talisman against death, and stressed the importance of astrology.

== Coinage ==
On the reverse of his coins, Hormizd is depicted wearing a crown equivalent to that of the second worn by his great-grandfather Peroz I (). The crown consists of a diadem, a crown with crenellations in the middle and behind, and the korymbos, with a moon crescent at the front. Hormizd made use of astral symbols on the obverse side—stars and crescents are present at 3, 6, and 9 o&#x27;clock. Gold coins were rarely minted under the Sasanians, with Hormizd being one of the rulers to never mint them.

==Family==
Two of Hormizd&#x27;s wives are known, one of them being an Ispahbudhan noblewoman, who was the daughter of Shapur, whilst the other one was a Christian woman.

Besides Khosrow II (), Hormizd also had an unnamed daughter, who married Shahrbaraz of the House of Mihran.

<text>Hormizd VI () was a Sasanian prince who ruled from 630 to 632.

The overthrow and execution of his grandfather Khosrow II () in 628 led to a civil war that saw many pretenders to the Sasanian throne. This period saw a series of monarchs with very short reigns, often of less than a year. Before Hormizd VI, Shapur-i Shahrvaraz had a short reign, before he was deposed by powerful magnate Farrukh Hormizd. He then raised the Sasanian princess Azarmidokht to the throne in Ctesiphon in 630. Shortly after, the troops of prominent Sasanian general and usurper Shahrbaraz proclaimed Horizd VI to be king in Nisibis.

He maintained himself about two years in Nisibis, until he was overthrown by the same troops who had previously supported him. Yazdegerd III, another grandson of Khosrow II, with the support of the nobles, succeeded in becoming the sole ruler of the empire.

<text>Peroz I () was the Sasanian King of Kings () of Iran from 459 to 484. A son of Yazdegerd II (), he disputed the rule of his elder brother and incumbent king Hormizd III (), eventually seizing the throne after a two-year struggle. His reign was marked by war and famine. Early in his reign, he successfully quelled a rebellion in Caucasian Albania in the west, and put an end to the Kidarites in the east, briefly expanding Sasanian rule into Tokharistan, where he issued gold coins with his likeness at Balkh. Simultaneously, Iran was suffering from a seven-year famine. He soon clashed with the former subjects of the Kidarites, the Hephthalites, who possibly had previously helped him to gain his throne. He was defeated and captured twice by the Hephthalites and lost his recently acquired possessions.

In 482, revolts broke out in the western provinces of Armenia and Iberia, led by Vahan Mamikonian and Vakhtang I respectively. Before Peroz could quell the unrest there, he was defeated and killed in his third war with the Hephthalites in 484, who seized the main Sasanian cities of the eastern region of Khorasan−Nishapur, Herat and Marw. Taking advantage of the weakened Sasanian authority in the east, the Nezak Huns subsequently seized the region of Zabulistan. Peroz was the last to mint unique gold coins in the Indian region of Sindh, which indicates that the region was lost around the same period. Albeit a devout Zoroastrian, Peroz supported the newly established Christian sect of Nestorianism, and just before his death, it was declared the official doctrine of the Iranian church.

Peroz&#x27;s wars against the Hephthalites have been described as &quot;foolhardy&quot; in both contemporary and modern historiography. His defeat and death introduced a period of political, social and religious tumult. The empire reached its lowest ebb; the was now a client of the Hephthalites and was compelled to pay tribute, while the nobility and clergy exerted great influence and authority over the nation, being able to act as king-makers. The magnates—most notably Sukhra and Shapur Mihran—elected Peroz&#x27;s brother, Balash, as the new . Order would first be restored under Peroz&#x27;s son Kavad I (), who reformed the empire and defeated the Hephthalites, reconquering Khorasan. By 560, Peroz had been avenged by his grandson Khosrow I (), who in collaboration with the First Turkic Khaganate, destroyed the Hephthalites.

== Name ==
&quot;Peroz&quot; is a Middle Persian name, meaning &quot;victorious&quot;. It is attested in Parthian as , whilst its New Persian form is (Arabicized form: ). Peroz is transliterated in Greek as (). The Georgian transliteration of the name, , was introduced into Georgian twice; through its Middle Iranian form (Parthian/Middle Persian) and in the New Persian form. The Armenian transliteration, (), follows the exact same spelling as the Middle Persian original. The name Peroz had already been in use by members of the Sasanian family in the 3rd-century, namely by the Kushano-Sasanian ruler Peroz I Kushanshah.

== Rise to power ==

When Peroz&#x27;s father Yazdegerd II () died in 457, he had reportedly not designed a successor and instead—according to the medieval historian al-Tha&#x27;alibi—entrusted the task to the elite and the leading (margraves). Civil war soon followed; Yazdegerd II&#x27;s eldest son Hormizd III declared himself king at the city of Ray in northern Iran, while Peroz fled to the northeastern part of the empire and began raising an army in order to claim the throne for himself. The brothers&#x27; mother, queen Denag, temporarily ruled as regent of the empire from its capital, Ctesiphon. According to eastern sources, Peroz was more worthy for the throne than Hormizd, who they refer to as &quot;unfair&quot;. Only the anonymous source known as the &quot;Codex Sprenger 30&quot; describes Hormizd as the &quot;braver and better&quot;, while describing Peroz as &quot;more learned in religion&quot;.

Both brothers seemingly attempted to gain the support of the powers of the neighbouring eastern region of Tokharistan/Bactria in their struggle. The region was then controlled by the Kidarites, along with some of their local vassals, such as the Hephthalites. According to three contemporary letters in the Bactrian language (the language of Tokharistan), the local ruler of the city of Rob (between Kabul and Balkh) Kirdir-Warahran, is given the honorific titles of &quot;glorious through Hormizd&quot; and &quot;true to Peroz&quot;, which seemingly indicates that he shifted his allegiance between the two brothers. According to the contemporary Armenian historians Elishe and Ghazar Parpetsi, Peroz was notably supported by the House of Mihran, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, while later Persian sources instead report that Peroz fled to the Hephthalites and enlisted their help.

This version, however, has been called &quot;legendary&quot; and &quot;somewhat fanciful&quot; by modern historians. The modern historians Parvaneh Pourshariati, Shapur Shahbazi and Michael Bonner prefer the Armenian version, with the latter suggesting that the Persian account may yield some authenticity, with Peroz enlisting Hephthalite aid through the Mihranids. Elishe and Ghazar give two slightly different accounts of Peroz&#x27;s struggle against Hormizd. According to the former, Peroz was aided by his Mihranid tutor Raham Mihran, who in 459 captured and executed Hormizd, and then crowned Peroz as . The same account is given by Ghazar, with the exception that the Mihranid is named Ashtad Mihran, and was not the tutor, but rather foster father of Peroz.

== Reign ==
=== Revolt in Caucasian Albania and famine ===
During the dynastic struggle between Peroz and Hormizd III, the Arsacid king of Caucasian Albania, Vache II (), took advantage of the tumultuous situation and declared independence. He allowed the Huns into the city of Derbent, and with their aid attacked the Iranian army. Peroz responded by allowing the Huns to pass through the Darial Gorge, and they subsequently ravaged Albania. The two kings negotiated an accord; Vache II would return his mother (Peroz&#x27;s sister) and daughter to Peroz, while he would receive the 1,000 families he had originally been given by his father as his share of the inheritance. Vache II abdicated in 462, leaving Albania kingless until 485, when Vachagan III () was installed on the throne by Peroz&#x27;s brother and successor Balash (). Peroz also freed some of the Armenian aristocrats who had been jailed by his father in the aftermath of the Armenian uprising in 451. The previous year (461), Iran suffered from a severe drought, which caused a large-scale famine that would last until 467.

=== Relations with the Byzantine Empire ===

Early in Peroz&#x27;s reign, tensions began to rise between Iran and Byzantium. In the mid-460s, the Byzantines discovered that their general Ardaburius had been secretly corresponding with the Iranian court, urging Peroz to attack the Byzantines, with the promise of military support and presumably also intelligence. Ardaburius&#x27;s letters were intercepted and given to Byzantine emperor Leo I (), who had him removed from office and summoned to the capital, Constantinople. Ardaburius&#x27;s fate is not known. Leo responded to the Iranian activity by reinforcing his borders with them, which included the fortification of Callinicum in Syria.

Since the Byzantine–Iranian peace treaty of 387, both empires had agreed that they were obligated to cooperate in the defense of the Caucasus against nomadic attacks from the northern steppes. The Iranians took the major role in this, while the Byzantines contributed roughly of gold at irregular intervals. The Byzantines saw this payment as a contribution to their mutual defense, but the Iranians saw it as tribute which established Byzantium as a subordinate of Iran. Since the foundation of the Sasanian Empire, its rulers had demonstrated the sovereignty and power of their realm through collection of tribute, particularly from the Byzantines. Retaliating for Iran&#x27;s plot with Ardaburius, Leo stopped the payments. Repeated negotiations failed to resolve the issue. The Byzantines also appealed for the return of the city of Nisibis, which had been ceded to Iran as part of a treaty in 363. Tensions continued to increase until the accession of the Byzantine emperor Zeno () in 474, who resumed payment to Iran and also ransomed Peroz from captivity by the Hephthalites. Regardless, war almost erupted in the early 480s, when some Tayy clients of the Sasanians made incursions into Byzantine territory due to suffering from a two-year drought. The Iranian general Qardag Nakoragan, who was stationed at the frontier, quickly pacificed the Tayy raiders and ensured peace with the Byzantines.

=== War with the Kidarites ===

Since the reign of Shapur II (), Iran had to deal with nomadic invaders in the east known as &quot;Iranian Huns&quot; and made up of Hephthalites, Kidarites, Chionites and Alkhans. They seized Tokharistan and Gandhara from Shapur II and his Kushano-Sasanian clients, and eventually Kabul from Shapur III (). Archaeological, numismatic, and sigillographic evidence demonstrates that the Huns ruled a realm just as refined as that of the Sasanians. They swiftly adopted Iranian imperial symbolism and titulature, such as imitating Sasanian imperial coinage. The modern historian Richard Payne states: &quot;Far from the destructive &quot;xyonan&quot; of the Iranian accounts or the marauding barbarians of the Roman historians, the Hun kingdoms of post-Iranian Central Asia were city-based, tax-raising, ideologically innovative states the kings of kings found themselves hard pressed to unseat.&quot; The loss of the Armenian cavalry contingent after the revolt of Armenia in 451 weakened Sasanian efforts to keep their eastern enemies in check.

The Sasanian efforts were disrupted in the early 5th century by the Kidarites, who forced Yazdegerd I (), Bahram V (), and/or Yazdegerd II to pay them tribute. Although this did not trouble the Iranian treasury, it was nevertheless humiliating. Yazdegerd II eventually refused to pay tribute, which would later be used as a justification for the war that the Kidarites declared against Peroz in 464. Peroz lacked enough manpower to fight, and therefore asked for financial aid from the Byzantine Empire, which declined. He then offered peace to the king of the Kidarites, Kunkhas, and offered his sister in marriage, but sent a woman of low status instead.

After some time Kunkhas found about Peroz&#x27;s deception, and in turn attempted to trick him, by requesting him to send military experts to strengthen his army. When a group of 300 military experts arrived at the court of Kunkhas at Balaam (possibly Balkh), they were either killed or disfigured and sent back to Iran, with the information that Kunkhas did this due to Peroz&#x27;s false treaty. Around this time, Peroz allied himself with the Hephthalites and other Huns, such as Mehama, the ruler of Kadag in eastern Tokharistan. With their help, he finally vanquished the Kidarites in 466, and brought Tokharistan briefly under Sasanian control, issuing gold coins at Balkh. The style of the gold coin was largely based on the Kidarite coins, and displayed Peroz wearing his second crown. The legend of the coin displayed his name and title in Bactrian. The following year (467), an Iranian embassy journeyed to Constantinople, where the victory over the Kidarites was announced. An Iranian embassy sent to the Chinese Northern Wei dynasty in 468 may have done the same.

The Kidarites continued to rule in Gandhara, and possibly Sogdia. They were eventually conquered by the Alkhans in Gandhara, and by the Hephthalites in Sogdia. According to Bactrian chronicles, Mehama was subsequently promoted to the position of &quot;governor of the famous and prosperous king of kings Peroz&quot;. However, a power vacuum followed in Tokharistan, which allowed Mehama to gain autonomy, or possibly even independence.

=== First and second war with the Hephthalites ===

Peroz&#x27;s war with the Hephthalites is reported by at least two contemporary sources—the account of the Byzantine historian Procopius and the Syriac text of Pseudo-Joshua the Stylite. However, both sources are marred by errors and oversights. According to Pseudo-Joshua, Peroz fought three wars with the Hephthalites, but he only briefly mentions them. Procopius&#x27; report, although detailed, has only two wars. Additionally, Peroz&#x27;s war with the Hephthalites is also reported by the Mandaic &quot;Book of Kings&quot;. Many modern historians agree that he fought the Hephthalites three times.

With the fall of the Kidarites, their former subjects–the Hephthalites, who were based in eastern Tokharistan–took advantage of the power vacuum, extending their rule over all of Tokharistan. Their capital was most likely near the city of Kunduz in eastern Tokharistan, which the medieval scholar al-Biruni calls War-Waliz. The Hephthalite king is often given the name of Akhshunwar, which according to the Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani was probably a title used by the Hephthalite kings, similar to other contemporary Central Asian titles such as and . In order to halt the Hephthalite expansion, Peroz attacked them in 474, but was ambushed and captured near the border of Gurgan. He was ransomed by Zeno, who helped him restore good relations between the Sasanians and the Hephthalites. According to Procopius, Akhshunwar demanded that Peroz prostrate before him in exchange for his release. Following the advice of his priests, Peroz met Akhshunwar at dawn and pretended to prostrate before him, while in reality he was doing it before the rising sun, i.e. Mithra, the sun god.

In the late 470s or early 480s, Peroz launched a second campaign, which ended in his defeat and capture once more; he offered to pay thirty mule packs of silver drachms in ransom, but could only pay twenty. Unable to raise the rest, he sent his youngest son, Kavad, to the Hephthalite court in 482 as a hostage until this balance was paid. Payne notes that &quot;The sums involved were modest in comparison with late antique diplomatic subsidies or state revenues. But rumors of a caravan delivering tribute from the Iranian court to the Huns spread across the Iran and the Mediterranean worlds, as far as Sidonius Apollinaris in Gaul.&quot; After this, Akhshunwar minted coins of himself wearing a winged, triple-crescent crown, which was the third crown of Peroz, indicating that the Hephthalite king considered himself to be the legitimate ruler of Iran. Peroz imposed a poll tax on his subjects to raise the ten mule packs of silver, and secured the release of Kavad before he mounted his third campaign.

=== Revolts in Armenia and Iberia ===

Besides Caucasian Albania, the two other Iranian provinces in the Caucasus—Armenia and Iberia—were also dissatisfied with Zoroastrian Sasanian rule. In Armenia, Yazdegerd II&#x27;s policy of integrating the Christian nobility into the bureaucracy by forcing them to convert to Zoroastrianism had resulted in a large-scale rebellion in 451, led by the Armenian military leader Vardan Mamikonian. Although the Sasanians defeated the rebels at the Battle of Avarayr, the impact of the rebellion was still felt, and tensions continued to grow. Meanwhile, in Iberia, Peroz had favoured Varsken, the viceroy () of the Armeno-Iberian frontier region of Gugark. A member of the Mihranids of Gugark, Varsken was born a Christian, but when he travelled to the Iranian court in 470, he converted to Zoroastrianism and shifted his allegiance from the Christian Iberian monarchy to the Sasanian Empire. As a reward for his conversion, he was given the viceroyalty of Albania and a daughter of Peroz in marriage. Espousing his pro-Iranian position, he attempted to force his family to convert to Zoroastrianism, including his first wife Shushanik (a daughter of Vardan), whom he eventually killed, which made her a martyr. Varsken&#x27;s policies were unacceptable to the Iberian king Vakhtang I (), who had him killed and then revolted against Iran in 482. Almost simultaneously, the Armenians rebelled under the leadership of Vahan Mamikonian, a nephew of Vardan.

In the same year, the of Armenia, Adhur Gushnasp was defeated and killed by Vahan&#x27;s forces, who installed Sahak II Bagratuni as the new . Peroz sent an army under Zarmihr Hazarwuxt of the House of Karen to Armenia, while another army led by the Sasanian general Mihran, of the Mihranid family, was sent to Iberia. During the summer, an army led by Shapur Mihran, the son of Mihran, inflicted a defeat on a combined Armenian-Iberian army at Akesga, resulting in the death of Sahak II Bagratuni and Vahan&#x27;s brother Vasak, while Vakhtang fled to Byzantine-controlled Lazica. The role of Shapur Mihran in command of the army in Iberia implies that Peroz may have recalled his father, Mihran, to participate in his Hephthalite war.

Vahan retreated with the rest of his forces to the mountains in Tayk, from where they engaged in guerrilla warfare. Shapur Mihran restored Sasanian rule in Armenia, but was summoned to the court in Ctesiphon, resulting in Vahan regaining control of over the Armenian capital of Dvin, where he fortified himself. In 483, Iranian reinforcements arrived under Zarmihr Hazarwuxt, who laid siege to Dvin. Heavily outnumbered, Vahan mounted a surprise attack on the Iranians, defeating them at the Battle of Nerseapate, near Maku. Vahan retreated to the mountains once more, close to the Byzantine border. He hoped that the Iranians would not pursue and attack him there, in order to avoid risking a conflict with the Byzantines. However, after a night march, Zarmihr Hazarwuxt attacked the Armenian camp and managed to capture several princesses. Vahan and most of his men withdrew further into the mountains.

An unexpected turn of events changed the tide of the war: Peroz&#x27;s death in 484 during his war with the Hephthalites caused the Iranian army to withdraw from Armenia. Peroz&#x27;s brother and successor, Balash, made peace with Vahan, and appointed him as (minister) and later as of Armenia. Peace was likewise made in Iberia, where Vakhtang was able to resume his rule.

=== Third war with the Hephthalites and death ===

Against the counsel of the aristocracy and the clergy, Peroz prepared in Gurgan for a third campaign against the Hephthalites. Ghazar highlights the opposition amongst his men towards the campaign, stating that the Iranian forces were demoralised at the prospect of facing the Hepthalites to the point of near mutiny. Peroz left his brother Balash in charge of the empire, launching his Hephthalite campaign at the head of a large army in 484. When Akhshunwar learned of Peroz&#x27;s campaign, he sent his deputy with the following message &quot;You concluded peace with me in writing, under seal, and you promised not to make war against me. We defined common frontiers not to be crossed with hostile intent by either party.&quot;

A tower erected as a boundary marker near the Oxus by Peroz&#x27;s grandfather, Bahram V, was destroyed by Peroz. This event is reported by both Dinawari (d. 896) and al-Tabari (d. 923). The latter reported that Peroz had the tower tied to fifty elephants and three hundred men linked together and dragged it in front of his men, while he walked behind the tower, feigning not to have violated his grandfather&#x27;s peace treaty. Akhshunwar, unwilling to face Peroz directly, had a large trench dug across the battleground, concealing it with shrubbery and loose wood, and positioning his forces behind it. Charging at Akhshunwar&#x27;s forces, Peroz and his army fell into the trench, where they were killed. Their bodies were not recovered by the Iranians. The Iranian dead included many distinguished aristocrats, including four of Peroz&#x27;s sons or brothers. The site of the battle is uncertain; according to the modern historian Klaus Schippmann, it took place in present-day Afghanistan, possibly near Balkh.

Pseudo-Joshua, who portrays Peroz in a hostile manner, proposed that Peroz may have been able to escape from the trench, but subsequently either died of hunger in a cleft in a mountain or was killed and eaten by wild animals in a forest.

=== Aftermath ===
The main Sasanian cities of the eastern region of Khorasan−Nishapur, Herat and Marw were now under Hephthalite rule. Peroz&#x27;s retinue, including his daughter Perozdukht and his priests, were captured by Akhshunwar. Perozdukht was married to Akhshunwar, and bore him a daughter, who would later marry Peroz&#x27;s son Kavad I (). Due to Peroz&#x27;s defeat, a law was allegedly made that forbade pursuit of a withdrawing army. His wars against the Hephthalites have been described as &quot;foolhardy&quot; in both contemporary and modern historiography. His defeat and death introduced a period of political, social and religious tumult. The empire reached its lowest ebb: the was now a client of the Hephthalites and was compelled to pay tribute; while the nobility and clergy exerted great influence and authority over the nation, being able to act as king-makers. According to Payne, &quot;No other event in the history of the Sasanian dynasty so clearly vitiated the pretensions of [the Iranian Empire], and contemporaries were aghast at the foolhardiness of the king of kings.&quot; Taking advantage of the weakened Sasanian authority in the east, the Nezak Huns seized the region of Zabulistan. Peroz was the last to mint unique gold coins in the Indian region of Sindh, which indicates that the region was lost around the same period.

The Iranian magnate Sukhra quickly raised a new army and prevented the Hephthalites from achieving further success. A member of the House of Karen, Sukhra&#x27;s family claimed descent from the mythological heroes Karen and Tus, who had saved Iran after its king Nowzar had been killed by the Turanian Afrasiab, which Payne calls &quot;in circumstances too similar to those of Peroz&#x27;s death for the resemblance to be coincidental.&quot; According to the Iranologist Ehsan Yarshater, some of the Iranian–Turanian battles that are described in the medieval Persian epic (&#x27;The Book of Kings&#x27;) were seemingly based on the Hephthalite wars of Peroz and his successors. Peroz&#x27;s brother, Balash, was elected as by the Iranian magnates, most notably Sukhra and Shapur Mihran. Order was restored under Kavad I, who reformed the empire and defeated the Hephthalites, reconquering Khorasan. Peroz was avenged by his grandson Khosrow I (), who in collaboration with the First Turkic Khaganate destroyed the Hephthalites in 560.

Since Bahram I (), the Sasanian monarchs had primarily resided in Gundeshapur in southern Iran, due to its convenient position between the Iranian plateau and the Mesopotamian plain. Due to the increasing importance of the Tigris-Euphrates floodplains, the main residence of the was moved to Ctesiphon after Peroz.

== Religious policy ==

Peroz, like all other Sasanian rulers, was an adherent of Zoroastrianism. According to al-Tabari, Peroz &quot;displayed just rule and praiseworthy conduct, and showed piety,&quot; which according to Schippmann, indicates that he was most likely amenable to the demands of the Zoroastrian clergy. Under Peroz, the Zoroastrian sect of Zurvanism was seemingly rejected, although he retained the staunch Zurvanite Mihr-Narseh as his minister (). Under Peroz, the Iranian calendar was reformed; the New Year (Nowruz) and the epagomenal from the month Frawardin were moved to the month Adur.

Unlike his father, Peroz did not attempt to convert the Caucasian Albanians and Armenians to Zoroastrianism. Nevertheless, persecutions of Christians and Jews were reported to have occurred during Peroz&#x27;s reign. While Jewish accounts claim Iranian fanaticism as the reason behind the persecutions, Iranian accounts accuse the Jews of abusing the Zoroastrian priests. The modern historian Jacob Neusner suggested that there may be some truth in the Iranian accounts, and that the Jews may had done it due to anticipating the coming of the Messiah, who was to arrive 400 years after the destruction of the Second Temple (dated by the rabbis in 68 AD, thus in 468). He further adds that the Jews may have expected the country to become Jewish now with the coming of the Messiah. According to the modern historian Eberhard Sauer, Sasanian monarchs only persecuted other religions when it was in their urgent political interests to do so.

Peroz supported the new Christian sect of Nestorianism as the official doctrine of the Iranian Christian church. In 484, shortly before Peroz&#x27;s death, a council took place in Gundeshapur, where Nestorianism was announced as the official doctrine of the church.

== Building projects ==

Peroz was notable for founding many cities. According to &quot;The History of the Country of Albania&quot;, Peroz ordered his vassal the Caucasian Albanian king Vache II to have the city of Perozapat (&quot;the city of Peroz&quot; or &quot;Prosperous Peroz&quot;) built. However, this is unlikely as the Kingdom of Caucasian Albania had been abolished by Peroz after a suppressing a revolt by Vache II in the mid-460s. The city was seemingly founded by Peroz himself after the removal of the ruling family in Caucasian Albania. Due to its more secure location, it was made the new residence of the Iranian . Peroz also founded Shahram Peroz (Ardabil) in Adurbadagan; Ram Peroz near Ray; and Rowshan Peroz between Gurgan and Derbent.

The basilica of Bolnisi Sioni in Iberia is a testimony of the growing Sasanian influence there. It was constructed in 478/479 in the southern part of the country, which had fallen under the local control of the Mihranids of Gugark. The iconography of the basilica showed Iranian characteristics, while its inscription, written in Old Georgian, mentions Peroz:

Although the basilica was not commissioned by Peroz, the builders of Bolnisi Sioni might have been inspired by the royal constructions of the Sasanians.

Peroz&#x27;s reign marks the latest possible date for the completion of the Great Wall of Gorgan, whose construction had started in the late 4th-century. Additional fortifications were later made to the wall, possibly as late as the reigns of Kavad I and Khosrow I. The wall, stretching from the Caspian coast to Pishkamar, was the largest of its time, and the biggest Iranian investment in military infrastructure in the late antique and medieval periods.

== Coinage and imperial ideology ==

On Peroz&#x27;s coinage the traditional Sasanian titulature of (&quot;King of Kings&quot;) is omitted, and only the two aspects of (&quot;King Peroz&quot;) are displayed. One of Peroz&#x27;s seals demonstrates that the traditional titulature was still used, which indicates that coins do not with certainty display the full formal titulature of the Sasanian monarchs. The use of the mythological Kayanian title of , first used by Peroz&#x27;s father Yazdegerd II, was due to a shift in the political perspective of the Sasanian Empire. Originally disposed towards the west, this now changed to the east. This shift, which had already started under Yazdegerd I and Bahram V, reached its zenith under Peroz I and his father. It may have been triggered by the aggression of the tribes on the eastern frontier. The war against the Hunnic tribes may have awakened the mythical rivalry existing between the Iranian Kayanian rulers and their Turanian enemies, which is demonstrated in the Younger Avesta.

This conflict between Iran and its eastern enemies may have resulted in the adoption of the title of , used by the Iranian mythical kings in their war against the Turanians in the east. It is probable that it was during this period that legendary and epic texts were collected by the Sasanians, including the legend of the Iranian hero-king Fereydun (Frēdōn in Middle Persian), who divided his kingdom between his three sons: his eldest son Salm received the empire of the west, Rome; the second eldest Tur received the empire of the east, Turan; and the youngest, Iraj, received the heartland of the empire, Iran. Influenced by these tales of the Kayanians, the Sasanians may have believed themselves to be the heirs of the Fereydun and Iraj, and so possibly considered both the Byzantine domains in west and the eastern domains of the Hephthalites as belonging to Iran. The Sasanians may therefore have been symbolically asserting their rights over these lands by assuming the title of .

Peroz depicted himself with three different crowns on his coins. The first consists of a diadem, a crown with crenellations in the middle, and the korymbos, with a moon crescent at the front. The second crown is similar to the first, with the exception that crenellations have been extended to the back of the cap. On the third crown, two wings are added, which is a reference to Verethragna, the god of victory. Peroz and Shapur II () were the only two Sasanian monarchs to regularly mint gold coins. The Austrian historian and numismatist Nikolaus Schindel has suggested that gold coins were generally not used in daily lives, but instead used as a form of donation given to high-ranking Iranian magnates by the , seemingly during festivities.

== In Persian literature ==
Peroz is included in a legendary romantic story narrated by the 13th-century Iranian historian Ibn Isfandiyar. The story begins with Peroz dreaming about a beautiful woman whom he falls in love with. Peroz then sends one of his relatives who is also a close friend, Mihrfiruz from the Mihran family, to find her. Mihrfiruz finds the woman and discovers her to be the daughter of the Mihranid general Ashtad Mihran. Peroz marries her and, at her request, lays the foundations of the city of Amol in Tabaristan.

<text>Gourds include the fruits of some flowering plant species in the family Cucurbitaceae, particularly &quot;Cucurbita&quot; and &quot;Lagenaria&quot;. The term refers to a number of species and subspecies, many with hard shells, and some without. Many gourds have large, bulbous bodies and long necks, such as Dipper Gourds, many variations of Bottle Gourd and caveman club gourds. One of the earliest domesticated types of plants, subspecies of the bottle gourd, &quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;, have been discovered in archaeological sites dating from as early as 13,000 BC. Gourds have had numerous uses throughout history, including as tools, musical instruments, objects of art, film, and food.

==Terminology==
&quot;Gourd&quot; is occasionally used to describe crop plants in the family Cucurbitaceae, like pumpkins, cucumbers, squash, luffa, and melons. More specifically, &quot;gourd&quot; refers to the fruits of plants in the two Cucurbitaceae genera &quot;Lagenaria&quot; and &quot;Cucurbita&quot;, or also to their hollow, dried-out shell.

There are many different gourds worldwide. The main plants referred to as gourds include several species from the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot; (mostly native to North America, including the Malabar gourd and turban squash), &quot;Crescentia cujete&quot; (the tree gourd or calabash tree, native to the American tropics) and &quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot; (bottle gourd, thought to be originally from Africa but present worldwide). Other plants with gourd in their name include the luffa gourd (likely domesticated in Asia), which includes several species from the genus &quot;Luffa&quot;, as well as the wax gourd, snake gourd, teasel gourd, hedgehog gourd, buffalo gourd/coyote gourd. The bitter melon/balsam apple/balsam pear is also sometimes referred to as a gourd.

==History==
&quot;L. siceraria&quot; or bottle gourd, are native to the Americas, being found in Peruvian archaeological sites dating from 13,000 to 11,000 BC and Thailand sites from 11,000 to 6,000 BC. A study of bottle gourd DNA published in 2005 suggests that there are two distinct subspecies of bottle gourds, domesticated independently in Africa and Asia, the latter approximately 4,000 years earlier. The gourds found in the Americas appear to have come from the Asian subspecies very early in history, although a new study now indicates Africa. The archaeological and DNA records show it is likely that the gourd was among the first domesticated species, in Asia between 12,000 and 13,000 years before present, and possibly the first domesticated plant species.

Wild, poisonous gourds (&quot;Citrullus colocynthis&quot;) were unknowingly added to the company of prophets&#x27; stew according to a story of Elisha in the Hebrew Bible. Elisha added flour to the stew in order to purify it. This interpretation of the verse is disputed by Rashi&#x27;s interpretation, who translates it as poisonous mushrooms, not poisonous gourds.

Gourds continued to be used throughout history in almost every culture throughout the world. European contact in North America found extensive gourd use, including the use of bottle gourds as birdhouses to attract purple martins, which provided bug control for agriculture. Almost every culture had musical instruments made of gourds, including drums, stringed instruments common to Africa and wind instruments, including the nose flutes of the Pacific.

==Research==
Scientists in India have been working on crossbreeding six members of the &quot;Momordica&quot; (bitter gourd) genus found in India to reduce the unpleasant taste while retaining the nutritional and medicinal values of the plants. These include Teasle gourd (&quot;Momordica dioica&quot;), Spine gourd (&quot;Momordica subangulata&quot;), Sweet gourd (&quot;Momordica cochinchinensis&quot;), balsam apple (&quot;Momordica balsamina&quot;) and &quot;Momordica sahyadrica&quot;.

==Uses==
Cultures from arid regions often associate gourds with water, and they appear in many creation myths. Since before human written history, they have had a multitude of uses including food storage, cooking tools, toys, musical instruments and decoration. Today, gourds are commonly used for a wide variety of crafts, including jewelry, furniture, dishes, utensils and a wide variety of decorations using carving, burning and other techniques such as lamps and containers for storing objects.

Just one example of a musical instrument is the West African Balafon, a xylophone that has gourds attached to the bottom of each note for resonance.

==Folklore==
Gourds have maintained a prominent role in the mythology of numerous cultures. In regard to Christianity, several artists such as Frans Floris and Carlo Crivelli have depicted the gourd as a symbol of the Resurrection of Christ, juxtaposed with the Fruit of Good and Evil that was consumed by Adam and Eve. In the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, a gourd tree was used to shield Jonah from intense weather conditions while he was surveying Nineveh. This terminology is contested by the New King James Version which calls which simply uses the term plant. In Catholicism, the calabash and rod that pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago adorn have become synonymous with the image of Raphael (archangel).

The gourd also makes frequent appearances in Chinese mythology. The Chinese god of longevity Shouxing is often depicted carrying a staff with a gourd attached to its end. Li Tieguai, one of the Eight Immortals is also often depicted with a bottle gourd that contains a special medicine that he uses to aid the sick, poor, or needy. These depictions denote the fruit&#x27;s significance as a symbol of longevity and the power of medicine within Chinese culture.

<text>In BDSM, edgeplay is a subjective term for activity (sexual or mentally manipulative) that may challenge the conventional safe, sane and consensual (&quot;SSC&quot;) scheme; if one is aware of the risks and consequences and is willing to accept them, then the activity is considered risk-aware consensual kink (&quot;RACK&quot;).

Edgeplay may involve the consequences of potential short or long-term harm or death, exemplified by activities such as breathplay (erotic asphyxiation), fire play, knife play, fear play, temperature play, wax play, consensual non-consent, and gunplay, as well as the potential increased risk of infection when the possibility of bodily fluid exchange is present, such as with cutting, bloodplay, or barebacking.

In the mid-1990s, the Living in Leather convention did not have discussion on ageplay, salirophilia or scat because, at the time, they were considered too extreme for consensual activity. By 2000, some considered them to be within the scope of edgeplay.

<text>Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, is the birthplace and family home of Sir Isaac Newton. In the orchard within the grounds is Newton&#x27;s famous apple tree. A Grade I listed building, it is now owned by the National Trust and open to the public.

== History ==
=== Before Isaac Newton’s birth===
Originally part of the estate of Colsterworth and still part of its ecclesiastical parish, by the twelfth century Woolsthorpe was a separate manor. It was the seat of various families including the Sleafords, the Pigotts, the Thimelbys, the Burys, and the Underwoods, who in 1623 sold it to Robert Newton, grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton. It was the Newton family&#x27;s second property in Woolsthorpe and Robert then settled it on his eldest son Isaac as a wedding dowry in 1639. With the property went the title Lord of the Manor. However, by the 17th century the manorial rights had been largely eroded and the house acted more as a yeoman&#x27;s farmstead, principally rearing sheep. In April 1642 Isaac married Hannah Ayscough and died in October the same year, three months before the birth of his son.

=== Isaac Newton ===
Sir Isaac Newton was born in the house on Christmas Day 1642 (N.S. 4 January 1643) and was baptised on New Year&#x27;s Day (11 January) in the nearby parish church of St John the Baptist, Colsterworth. At the age of three his widowed mother Hannah remarried and moved to North Witham a mile and a half away leaving Isaac to be raised by his grandparents, returning to Woolsthorpe after she was widowed a second time seven years later. When Newton was twelve he was sent to The King&#x27;s School in Grantham and later worked with the local apothecary. He returned briefly at the age of 17; however, unsuited to and uninterested in a life of professional husbandry, he soon returned to Grantham and in 1661 at the age of 18 left Lincolnshire for Trinity College in Cambridge.

Newton returned to Woolsthorpe in 1666 when Cambridge University closed due to the plague, and performed many of his most famous experiments there, most notably his work on light and optics. This is also said to be the site where Newton, observing an apple fall from a tree, was inspired to formulate his law of universal gravitation.

=== After Newton ===

When Newton died in 1727 the manor passed to his nearest male heir, John Newton, his uncle Robert&#x27;s great-grandson. In 1732 the estate was sold to the Turnor family, based at the nearby Stoke Rochford Estate, who leased the manor to a farming family called the Woolerton. They remained the tenants for the next 200 years. In 1942 the manor was purchased by the Pilgrim Trust and the Royal Society who then gave it to the National Trust for preservation.

=== National Trust ===
Now in the hands of the National Trust and open to the public except in winter, it is presented as a typical seventeenth century yeoman&#x27;s farmhouse.

New areas of the house, once private, were opened up to the public in 2003, with the old rear steps (originally to the hay loft and grain store, often seen in period drawings) being rebuilt, and the old walled kitchen garden to the rear of the house being restored.

One of the former farmyard buildings has been equipped as an interactive visitor experience of the physical principles investigated by Newton in the house.

==The tree==
Isaac Newton recounted to his contemporary William Stukeley how an apple tree in the orchard inspired him to work on his law of universal gravitation. Dendrochronology confirms one of the trees in the orchard to be over 400 years old, having regrown from roots surviving from a tree which blew down in 1820. It is attended to by gardeners, secured with a fence, and cared for by the National Trust.

==The village==

Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth (not to be confused with Woolsthorpe-by-Belvoir, also in Lincolnshire) has grown from a hamlet of several houses in the seventeenth century to a small village of several hundred houses today; much of the original land once owned by Woolsthorpe Manor was sold to a nearby family, and some of the immediate open land has since been built upon. Woolsthorpe Manor remains on the edge of the village and is mostly surrounded by fields.

== In popular culture ==
* Appears in episode three and ten of the TV documentary &quot;&quot;, whilst discussing the development of planetary motion and Newton&#x27;s work on the matter.
* Appears in opening to episode two, &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot;, of the 60th anniversary series of Doctor Who, first broadcast on 2 December 2023.
* Also appears in a BBC documentary, &quot;Isaac Newton: The Dark Heretic&quot;.

<doc id="140504" wikidata="Q392963" url="?curid=140504" title="Ageplay">
<text>Ageplay or age play is a form of roleplaying in which an individual acts or treats another as if they are a different age. Ageplay is roleplaying between adults, and involves consent from all parties. Ageplay is not necessarily sexual, but can be. Portraying any age can be the goal of ageplay, from babies to a child to the elderly. Usually this involves someone pretending to be younger than they actually are, but more rarely can involve assuming an older role.

==Characteristics and variations==
Ageplay is a form of roleplay between one or more consenting adults. Ageplay can be non-sexual, sexual, or something in between. Within dominant/submissive relationships, ageplay can enhance power dynamics, and allow a partner to feel more comfortable with their dominance or submission.

Sexual variations may include among other things such as incest play, in which individuals recreate and sexualize roles within a family. A common myth is that caregiver dynamics (caregiver/little, daddy/little, mommy/little) all involve ageplay. However, these dynamics are more about caring for one another than re-enacting an incest fantasy. Research shows that there is an interest in this kind of &quot;intergenerational play&quot; that is distinct from incest—or kinship—play.

Ageplay is often associated with pedophilia, but it is not related by professional psychologists to any form of sex abuse. Individuals who engage in ageplay are consenting adults who enjoy imagining or portraying themselves as children, or merely enjoy childlike elements typical of children present in adults.

===Paraphilic infantilism===
Paraphilic infantilism, colloquially known as &quot;adult baby&quot; play, is a specific form of ageplay which involves one or more consenting adults role-playing an age regression to an infant-like state. &quot;Adult baby&quot; play can be an expression of sexual fetish (or, more accurately, paraphilia) or simply as a non-sexual form of recreational adult role-play. 

Behaviors may include things such as wearing childish clothes, wearing or using diapers, cuddling with stuffed animals, drinking from a bottle or sucking on a pacifier, and (when done with others) engaging in gentle and nurturing experiences, baby talk, or BDSM power dynamics involving masochism, coercion, punishment or humiliation. People who participate in paraphilic infantilism are often referred to as &quot;adult babies&quot; or &quot;ABs&quot;.

Though distinct, within the kink community paraphilic infantilism is often associated with diaper fetishism under the umbrella term, &quot;adult baby/diaper lover&quot; or &quot;AB/DL&quot;.

Some research has aimed to separate ageplay from the pathologized framing of paraphilic infantilism, noting in part that paraphilic infantilism is not listed within the DSM-V. This research also discourages thinking of ageplay as an identity category.

==Ageplay events==
Specific conventions and major events have formed that specifically cater to ageplayers including:

* CAPCon (2010–present) a convention that occurs annually at a hotel in the Chicago, Illinois area of the United States
* Camp Abdulia (2012–2018) a gathering that occurred sporadically throughout various cities and states in the United States
* TOMKAT (2013–present) a gathering that occurs bi-annually at a private wilderness camp in Ontario, Canada
* TeddyCon (2014–2019) a convention that occurred annually at a hotel near Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the United States
* West Coast Jungle Gym (2019–2021) a convention that occurred annually at a hotel in San Diego, California area of the United States

<doc id="140506" wikidata="Q2981602" url="?curid=140506" title="Linux framebuffer">
<text>The Linux framebuffer (fbdev) is a linux subsystem used to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the system console.

It was designed as a hardware-independent API to give user space software access to the framebuffer (the part of a computer&#x27;s video memory containing a current video frame) using only the Linux kernel&#x27;s own basic facilities and its device file system interface, avoiding the need for libraries like SVGAlib which effectively implemented video drivers in user space.

In most applications, fbdev has been superseded by the Linux Direct Rendering Manager subsystem, but as of 2022, several drivers provide both DRM and fbdev APIs for backwards compatibility with software that has not been updated to use the DRM system, and there are still fbdev drivers for older (mostly embedded) hardware that does not have a DRM driver.

==Applications==
There are three applications of the Linux framebuffer:
* An implementation of text Linux console that doesn&#x27;t use hardware text mode (useful when that mode is unavailable, or to overcome its restrictions on glyph size, number of code points etc.). One popular aspect of this is the ability to have console show the Tux logo at boot up.
* A graphic output method for a display server, independent of video adapter hardware and its drivers.
* Graphic programs avoiding the overhead of the X Window System.
Examples of the third application include Linux programs such as MPlayer, links2, NetSurf, w3m, fbff, fbida, and fim, and libraries such as GLUT, SDL (version 1.2), GTK, and Qt, which can all use the framebuffer directly. This use case is particularly popular in embedded systems.

The now defunct DirectFB is another project aimed at providing a framework for hardware acceleration of the Linux framebuffer.

There was also a windowing system called FramebufferUI (fbui) implemented in kernel-space that provided a basic 2D windowing experience with very little memory use.

==History==
Linux has had generic framebuffer support since the 2.1.109 kernel.

It was originally implemented to allow the kernel to emulate a text console on systems such as the Apple Macintosh that do not have a text-mode display, and was later expanded to the IBM PC compatible platform.

<doc id="140509" wikidata="Q944855" url="?curid=140509" title="Siege of Pilsen">
<text>The siege of Pilsen (or Plzeň) or Battle of Pilsen was a siege of the fortified city of Pilsen () in Bohemia carried out by the forces of the Bohemian Protestants led by Ernst von Mansfeld. It was the first major battle of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Protestant victory and subsequent capture of the city enlarged the Bohemian Revolt.

== Eve of the battle ==
On 23 May 1618 the Protestant nobles overthrew the rule of King Ferdinand II and threw the Roman Catholic governors of Bohemia from their office at Prague Castle in the Defenestration of Prague. The new government formed of Protestant nobility and gentry gave Ernst von Mansfeld the command over all of its forces. Meanwhile, Catholic nobles and priests started fleeing the country. Some of the monasteries as well as unfortified manors were evacuated and the Catholic refugees headed for the city of Pilsen, where they thought that a successful defence could be organised. The city was well-prepared for a lengthy siege, but the defences were undermanned and the defenders lacked enough gunpowder for their artillery. Mansfeld decided to capture the city before the Catholics were able to gain support from the outside.

== Siege ==

On 19 September 1618 Mansfeld&#x27;s army reached the outskirts of the city. The defenders blocked two city gates and the third one was reinforced with additional guards. The Protestant army was too weak to start an all-out assault on the castle, so Mansfeld decided to take the city by hunger. On 2 October the Protestant artillery arrived, but the calibre and number of the cannons was small and the bombardment of the city walls brought little effect. The siege continued, with the Protestants receiving new supplies and recruits on a daily basis, while the defenders lacked food and munitions. Also, the main city well was destroyed and the stores of potable water soon depleted.

Finally, on 21 November, cracks were made in the walls and the Protestant soldiers poured into the city. After several hours of close hand-to-hand combat, all of the town was in Mansfeld&#x27;s hands.

== Aftermath ==

After capturing the city, Mansfeld demanded 120,000 golden guldens as war reparations and an additional 47,000 florins for sparing the city and not burning it to the ground. [Between the previous and next sentence, two years passed.] However, soon the Holy Roman Empire, led by Bavaria, gathered enough forces and crossed the border with Bohemia, heading towards Pilsen and Prague.

The newly elected Bohemian king, Frederick V of the Palatinate was aware of the huge superiority of his enemies&#x27; forces and ordered his own army to regroup and attack each of the advancing armies separately. However, he was abandoned by most of his allies and his armies dispersed in the dense forests between Pilsen and Prague, which resulted in a decisive defeat in the Battle of White Mountain.

<doc id="140510" wikidata="Q3047595" url="?curid=140510" title="Edinburgh Academy">
<text>The Edinburgh Academy is a private day school in Edinburgh, Scotland, which was opened in 1824. The original building, on Henderson Row in the city&#x27;s New Town, is now part of the Senior School. The Junior School is on Arboretum Road to the north of the city&#x27;s Royal Botanic Garden.

In 2023 the school was investigated by the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry over numerous allegations by ex-pupils of historical abuse by several staff. The Academy later issued an acknowledgement and apology.

==Foundation==

In 1822, the school&#x27;s founders, Henry Cockburn and Leonard Horner, agreed that Edinburgh required a new school to promote classical learning. Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal High School provided a classical education, but the founders felt that greater provision was needed for the teaching of Greek, to compete with some of England&#x27;s public schools. Cockburn and Horner recruited John Russell as a co-founder and the three of them, together with other interested parties, put a proposal to the City Council for the building of a new school. The City Fathers gave their approval in 1823 and fifteen committee members were elected.

==Buildings==


The main building of the Senior School, with its Greek Doric frontage, was designed by architect William Burn. The stone used was principally from the nearby Craigleith Quarry. The Foundation Stone was laid in June 1823 and the school opened for the first session in October 1824. In 1892, new classrooms were built along the western wall of the site, and in 1900, the School Library was opened, followed by the new Science Block in 1909, both along the eastern wall. At the back of the school the Dining Hall, and the Rifle Range beneath it, was opened in 1912 and after World War I, the Gymnasium was built. This was dedicated as a War Memorial to Edinburgh Academicals (former pupils) who had fallen during the hostilities of 1914 to 1918.

In 1945, a new building, Denham Green House, was acquired in the Trinity area of Edinburgh. This was used for the junior department (now known as Early Years) of the Preparatory School (now known as The Edinburgh Academy Junior School). In 1960, a new building for the upper three years of the Preparatory School was completed in Inverleith (Arboretum campus). Denham Green&#x27;s nursery and early years facilities were relocated to purpose built accommodation on the Preparatory school&#x27;s Arboretum campus in 1987. In 1992, the Rector&#x27;s residence, &quot;Academy House&quot; and in 1997, a new Games Hall were constructed on the same campus. The latter was partly funded by money from The Lottery and Sports Council and is for the use not only of pupils in both parts of the school but also of the community in the area. A new computing and music building was completed at the Junior School in 2005 and a new nursery and after school facility in 2009.

At Henderson Row, the property next to the school, No 32, was acquired for administrative use in 1972 and in 1977, the Academy acquired the junior school of Donaldson&#x27;s College, to the west. This allowed departments to expand and a purpose-built Music School was opened on this part of the campus in 1991. In 2005 the 1909 science block was demolished and a new science block, the James Clerk Maxwell Centre, named in honour of the 19th century scientist and former pupil, was opened by Lord Falconer of Thoroton on 3 November 2006.

== Teaching ==
The Edinburgh Academy was originally a day and boarding school for boys. It opened its primary school in 1960 and its nursery in 2009. While girls first arrived in the 1970s, it ceased boarding and transitioned to co-education in 2008 and is now a fully coeducational day school.

== Abuse==
In 2020 and 2021, six men accused a man later named as Iain Wares of physical and sexual abuse when they were pupils in the 1970s. The Scottish Crown Prosecution Service was initially reluctant to prosecute because of difficulties in seeking his extradition from South Africa, where he had moved, and his advanced age, but South Africa in 2020 approved the UK&#x27;s request for extradition on six charges of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour and one of indecent assault.

On 27 July 2022, broadcaster Nicky Campbell disclosed that he had witnessed and experienced sexual and violent physical abuse while a pupil at the Edinburgh Academy in the 1970s. Alex Renton, a journalist investigating child abuse in private schools, reported that ex-pupils of Edinburgh Academy had named 17 other staff members, employed between the 1950s and 1980s, as physical and sexual abusers.

From 8 August 2023, the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI) hearings in Edinburgh, before Anne Smith, Lady Smith, took evidence from former pupils and members of staff of the Edinburgh Academy and medical experts. When actor Iain Glen spoke out about his abuse in 2002, &quot;the wrath of Morningside and Muirfield and Murrayfield rained down on his head with biblical fury because he&#x27;d broken the code, the Edinburgh omertà&quot;.

Also frequently mentioned was Hamish Dawson, deceased, whose affectionate appreciation from the Rector in September 1984 was contradicted by testimony from many reporting having suffered at his hands. On 30 August 2023, the school issued an apology for both the &quot;brutal and unrestrained&quot; historical abuse and its consequences for &quot;grown men deeply damaged as children&quot;.

On 30 November 2023, BBC1 broadcast a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme &#x27;My Teacher the Abuser: Fighting for Justice&#x27;, devoted to the history of abuse at the Edinburgh Academy and Fettes College and concentrating on the allegations against Iain Wares and the efforts to extradite him from South Africa. On 12 December 2023, Police Scotland announced that five former teaching staff aged between 69 and 90 had been arrested for questioning regarding alleged abuse incidents between 1968 and 1992, with one further individual to be referred to the authorities.

On 11 March 2024 at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, an examination of facts hearing regarding John Brownlee commenced as, at 89 and demented, he was deemed unfit to stand trial. Nicky Campbell described repeated physical mistreatment. Other pupils had reported similar cases.

On 27 March, after over two weeks&#x27; testimony from 42 former pupils, the Sheriff ruled that Brownlee had repeatedly committed a number of violent assaults against children aged between eight and 11 years, spanning 31 charges as well as ‘cruel and unnatural acts’ at the school. A spokesman from the Edinburgh Academy Survivors group afterwards described Brownlee as a &quot;violent monster&quot; who had caused &quot;a lifetime of damage to everyone concerned&quot;. The evidence was also reported to have exposed a wider culture of complicity at the school.

==Notable alumni==
Former pupils of the Edinburgh Academy are known as &quot;Academicals&quot;, or &quot;Accies&quot;, a name shared with the associated rugby club.

Famous alumni of the school include Robert Louis Stevenson, James Clerk Maxwell, Nicky Campbell, Magnus Magnusson, Baron Falconer of Thoroton, Mike Blair, and Iain Glen. It has also produced one Nobel Prize winner (J. Michael Kosterlitz), numerous political and legal figures, several rugby internationals and nine recipients of the Victoria Cross; the highest number of any school in Scotland. According to the Sutton Trust, the school is placed second in Scotland and joint 36th in the UK for the number of the nation&#x27;s leading people produced.

<text>William King (1663–1712) was an English poet.

==Life==
Born in London, England, the son of Ezekiel King, he was related to the family of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. From Westminster School, where he was a scholar under Richard Busby, at the age of 18, he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1681. There, he is said to have dedicated himself completely to his studies. Reportedly, after eight years, he had read over 22,000 books and manuscripts, a figure reduced to about 7,000 in seven years by Thomas Young.

In 1688, he graduated with an M.A. Taking up the civil law, he became a doctor in 1692 and was admitted as an advocate at Doctors&#x27; Commons. In 1702, having moved to Ireland, he was made Judge of the Admiralty, Commissioner of the Prizes, Keeper of the Records in Birmingham&#x27;s Tower, and Vicar-General to Narcissus Marsh, the primate. King found a friend in Anthony Upton, one of the High Court judges, who had a house called Mountown, near Dublin, where King frequently stayed. Both men were severely criticised by their political opponents for neglecting their official duties; it was said that they had no ambition but to live out their days in rural retirement.

In 1708, when Lord Wharton was sent to govern Ireland, the King returned to London.

In 1710, he became a supporter of the High Church party, on the side of Henry Sacheverell, and was supposed to have had some part in setting up &quot;The Examiner&quot;. He was suspicious of the operations of Whiggism, and he criticised White Kennet&#x27;s adulatory sermon at the funeral of the Duke of Devonshire.

In the autumn of 1712, King&#x27;s health declined, and he died on Christmas Day.

==Works==
In 1688, King published &quot;Reflections upon Mons Varillas&#x27;s History of Heresy&quot;, written with Edward Hannes, a confutation of Antoine Varillas&#x27;s account of John Wycliffe. He had already made some translations from the French language and written some humorous and satirical pieces, and in 1694, Molesworth published his &quot;Account of Denmark&quot;, in which he treated the Danes and their monarch with great contempt. This book offended Prince George of Denmark, the consort of Queen Anne, and the Danish Minister protested.

In 1699, he published &quot;A Journey to London&quot;, following the method of Dr. Martin Lister, who had published &quot;A Journey to Paris&quot;. And in 1700, he satirised the Royal Society—or at least, Sir Hans Sloane, their president—in two dialogues entitled &quot;The Transactioner&quot;. At Mountown, the home of his friend Mr Justice Upton, he wrote the poem &quot;Mully of Mountown&quot;.

Back in London, King published some essays called &quot;Useful Transactions&quot;, including &quot;Voyage to the Island of Cajamai&quot;. He then wrote the &quot;Art of Love&quot;, a poem, and in 1709 he imitated Horace in an &quot;Art of Cookery&quot;, which he published with some letters to Lister. The same year he published three issues of philosophical parodies under the title &quot;Useful Transactions in Philosophy and Other Sorts of Learning&quot;. &quot;The History of the Gods&quot;, a book composed for schools, was written in 1711. The same year, he published &quot;Rufinus&quot;, a historical essay and a political poem on the Duke of Marlborough and his adherents.

<doc id="140526" wikidata="Q57100" url="?curid=140526" title="Maria Goeppert Mayer">
<text>Maria Goeppert Mayer (; ; June 28, 1906 – February 20, 1972) was a German-American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate in Physics for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus. She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics, the first being Marie Curie. In 1986, the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award for early-career women physicists was established in her honor.

A graduate of the University of Göttingen, Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the laser in the 1960s later permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.

Maria Goeppert married chemist Joseph Edward Mayer and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on double beta decay in 1935. In 1937, she moved to Columbia University, where she took an unpaid position. During World War II, she worked for the Manhattan Project at Columbia on isotope separation, and with Edward Teller at the Los Alamos Laboratory on the development of thermonuclear weapons.

After the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of physics at the University of Chicago (where her husband and Teller worked) and a senior physicist at the university-run Argonne National Laboratory. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego.

== Early life ==
Maria Göppert was born on June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz (now Katowice, Poland), a Silesian city in the former Kingdom of Prussia, the only child of paediatrician Friedrich Göppert and his wife Maria née Wolff. In 1910, she moved with her family to Göttingen when her father, a sixth-generation university professor, was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the University of Göttingen. Göppert was closer to her father than to her mother. &quot;Well, my father was more interesting&quot;, she later explained. &quot;He was after all a scientist&quot;.

Göppert was educated at the &quot;Höhere Technische&quot; in Göttingen, a school for middle-class girls who aspired to higher education. In 1921, she entered the &quot;Frauenstudium&quot;, a private high school run by suffragettes that aimed to prepare girls for university. She took the &quot;abitur&quot;, the university entrance examination, at age 17, a year early, with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys. All the girls passed, but only one of the boys did.

In the spring of 1924, Göppert entered the University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics. She spent one year at Cambridge university, in England, before returning to Göttingen. A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, Emmy Noether, but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.

Instead, Göppert became interested in physics, and chose to pursue a PhD. In her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. Eugene Wigner later described the thesis as &quot;a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness&quot;. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the laser permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a europium-doped crystal. To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the &quot;GM&quot;. One GM is 10−50 cm4 s photon−1. Her examiners were three Nobel Prize winners: Max Born, James Franck and Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus (in 1954, 1925, and 1928, respectively).

On January 19, 1930, Goeppert married Joseph Edward Mayer, an American Rockefeller fellow who was one of James Franck&#x27;s assistants. The two had met when Mayer had boarded with the Goeppert family. The couple moved to Mayer&#x27;s home country of the United States, where he had been offered a position as associate professor of chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. They had two children, Maria Ann (who later married Donat Wentzel) and Peter Conrad.

== United States ==
Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from hiring Goeppert Mayer as a faculty member. These rules, created at many universities to prevent patronage, had by this time lost their original purpose and were primarily used to prevent the employment of women married to faculty members. She was given a job as an assistant in the physics department working with German correspondence, for which she received a very small salary, a place to work and access to the facilities. She taught some courses, and published an important paper on double beta decay in 1935.
There was little interest in quantum mechanics at Johns Hopkins but Goeppert Mayer worked with Karl Herzfeld in this area. They collaborated on a number of papers, including a paper with Herzfeld&#x27;s student A.L. Sklar on the spectrum of benzene. She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the &quot;Handbuch der Physik&quot;. This ended when the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Concerned by the 1933 anti-Jewish laws that ousted professors of Jewish descent, Goeppert Mayer as well as Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.

Joe Mayer was fired in 1937. He attributed this to the hatred of women on the part of the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer&#x27;s presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer&#x27;s chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the physics department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939, with the three of them and their families living in nearby Leonia, New Jersey. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct. In 1941 she was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society.

== Manhattan Project ==

In December 1941, Goeppert Mayer took up her first paid professional position, teaching science part-time at Sarah Lawrence College. In the spring of 1942, with the United States embroiled in World War II, she joined the Manhattan Project. She accepted a part-time research post from Urey with Columbia University&#x27;s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the fissile uranium-235 isotope in natural uranium; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of uranium hexafluoride and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. This method proved impractical at the time, but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of separation of isotopes by laser excitation.

Through her friend Edward Teller, Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project, which researched the properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the Teller&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot; bomb, the wartime program for the development of thermonuclear weapons. In February 1945, Joe was sent to the Pacific War, and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller&#x27;s group at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Joe came back from the Pacific earlier than expected, and they returned to New York together in July 1945.

In February 1946, Joe became a professor in the chemistry department and the new Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago, and Goeppert Mayer was able to become a voluntary associate professor of physics at the school. When Teller also accepted a position there, she was able to continue her Opacity work with him. When the nearby Argonne National Laboratory was founded on July 1, 1946, Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part-time job there as a senior physicist in the theoretical physics division. She responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about nuclear physics.&quot; She programmed the Aberdeen Proving Ground&#x27;s ENIAC to solve criticality problems for a liquid metal cooled reactor using the Monte Carlo method. While in Chicago, Mayer derived the Bigeleisen-Mayer equation with Jacob Bigeleisen.

== Nuclear shell model ==
During her time at Chicago and Argonne in the late 1940s, Goeppert Mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, which she published in 1950. Her model explained why certain numbers of nucleons in an atomic nucleus result in particularly stable configurations. These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called &quot;magic numbers&quot;: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. In an account relayed by Joe Mayer, Maria Goppert Mayer attained a critical insight while speaking with Enrico Fermi. 
She had realised that the nucleus is a series of closed shells and pairs of neutrons and protons tend to couple together. She described the idea as follows:
Three German scientists, Otto Haxel, J. Hans D. Jensen, and Hans Suess, were also working on solving the same problem, and arrived at the same conclusion independently. While their results were announced in an issue of the Physical Review before Goeppert Mayer in June 1949, Goeppert Mayer&#x27;s work was received for review in February 1949, while the work of the German authors was received later in April 1949. Afterwards, she collaborated with them. Hans Jensen co-authored a book with Goeppert Mayer in 1950 titled &quot;Elementary Theory of Nuclear Shell Structure&quot;. Goeppert Mayer was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1956. In 1963, Goeppert Mayer and Jensen shared one half of the Nobel Prize for Physics &quot;for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure.&quot; The other half of that years Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Eugene Wigner. She was the second female Nobel laureate in physics, after Marie Curie, and would be the last for over half a century, until Donna Strickland was awarded the prize in 2018.

== Death and legacy ==

In 1960, Goeppert Mayer was appointed full professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. Although she suffered from a stroke shortly after arriving there, she continued to teach and conduct research for a number of years. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1965. Goeppert Mayer died in San Diego, California, on February 20, 1972, after a heart attack that had struck her the previous year left her comatose. She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.

After her death, the Maria Goeppert Mayer Award was created by the American Physical Society (APS) to honor young female physicists at the beginning of their careers. Open to all female physicists who hold PhDs, the winner receives money and the opportunity to give guest lectures about her research at four major institutions. In December 2018, the APS named Argonne National Laboratory an APS Historic Site in recognition of her work. Argonne National Laboratory also honors her by presenting an award each year to an outstanding young woman scientist or engineer, while the University of California, San Diego hosts an annual Maria Goeppert Mayer symposium, bringing together female researchers to discuss current science. Crater Goeppert Mayer on Venus, which has a diameter of about 35 km, is also named after Goeppert-Mayer. In 1996, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2011, she was included in the third issuance of the &quot;American Scientists&quot; collection of US postage stamps, along with Melvin Calvin, Asa Gray, and Severo Ochoa. Her papers are in Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego, and the university&#x27;s physics department is housed in Mayer Hall, which is named after her and her husband.

<doc id="140527" wikidata="Q1340088" url="?curid=140527" title="Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español">
<text> (English: Universal Free Encyclopedia in Spanish) was a Spanish-language wiki-based online encyclopedia that started as a fork of the Spanish Wikipedia, released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0 and using the same MediaWiki software.

==History==
The was founded by contributors to the Spanish Wikipedia who decided to start an independent project. Led by Edgar Enyedy, they left Wikipedia on 26 February 2002, and created the new website, provided by the University of Seville for free, with the freely licensed articles of the Spanish Wikipedia.

The reasons for the split are explained on Enciclopedia Libre. Key issues included concerns about censorship and the possibility of advertising on Wikipedia. Edgar Enyedy stated the main reasons for splitting at that time as:
* Perceived expectation that Wikipedia would soon start hosting advertisements.
* Non-English Wikipedias were running older versions of MediaWiki. 
* When national groups offered help in software development and maintenance, access to theservers was denied.
* The downloadable database dumps of Wikipedia content were highly outdated.
* Wikipedia was hosted on a .com rather than a .org domain.

==Post-split history==
In 2011, Enyedy said that the sole reason for the failure of as a long-term project was that it &quot;was not intended to last. It was merely a form of pressure. Some of the goals were achieved, not all of them, but it was worth the cost.&quot; He further said &quot;Nowadays, the romantic point of view is that EL survived and is still going strong.&quot; He argued that while the viewpoint is positive, it is not factual.

By late 2024 the site had ceased operations.

<text>The Freescale 683xx (formerly Motorola 683xx) is a family of compatible microcontrollers by Freescale that use a Motorola 68000-based CPU core. The family was designed using a hardware description language, making the parts synthesizable, and amenable to improved fabrication processes, such as die shrinks.

There are two CPU cores used in the 683xx family: the 68EC000 and the CPU32. The instruction set of the CPU32 core is similar to the 68020 without bitfield instructions, and with a few instructions unique to the CPU32 core, such as table lookup and interpolate instructions, and a low-power stop mode.

The modules of the microcontroller were designed independently and released as new CPUs could be tested. This process let the architects perform &quot;design-ahead&quot; so that when silicon technologies were available, Motorola had designs ready to implement and go to market. Many of these submodules have been carried forward into the Coldfire line of processors.

The microcontrollers consist of a series of modules, connected by an internal bus:
*A fully static CPU core, capable of running at any clock speed from dead stop to maximum rated speed (25 or 33 MHz).
*A CPU core designed to minimize transistors while maximizing performance.
*A high-speed clocked serial interface for debugging called background debug mode (BDM). The 683xx-series was the first to have a clocked serial interface to the CPU to perform debugging. Now, many CPUs use a standard serial test interface, usually JTAG, for this purpose.
*The SIM (System Integration Module), which eliminates much glue logic by providing chip selects and address decoding. The SIM also provides a clock generator, watchdogs for various system operations, configuration of processor pins, a periodic timer, and an interrupt controller.

Other modules available on various processors in the 683xx family are:
*The Timing Processor Unit (TPU), which performs almost any timing related task: timers, counters, proportional pulse width control, pulse width measurement, pulse generation, stepper motor controllers, quadrature detection, etc. Freescale gives the development system and code away for free.
*An auxiliary random-access memory (RAM) doubles as a programmable microcontroller store for the TPU.
*Some early models have two conventional counter-timers.
*A general purpose timer (GPT) module provides pulse accumulators, capture/compare, and pulse-width modulation capabilities.
*Some models have a network interface processor in the form of a communication processor module (CPM) and serial communications controllers (SCC) which can be interfaced to Ethernet or HDLC busses.
*Most models have a queued serial module (QSM) which provides both synchronous Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and logic-level RS-232 UART capabilities.

Motorola announced the 68341 and 68349 processors in 1993. The 68349, known as the &quot;Dragon I&quot; was designed to run the Magic Cap platform from General Magic for use in personal communicator devices. The 68341 was aimed at home entertainment and educational systems such as the Philips CD-i and in low-cost, low-power solutions generally.

<text>The Liberal Unionist Party was a British political party that was formed in 1886 by a faction that broke away from the Liberal Party. Led by Lord Hartington (later the Duke of Devonshire) and Joseph Chamberlain, the party established a political alliance with the Conservative Party in opposition to Irish Home Rule. The two parties formed the ten-year-long coalition Unionist Government 1895–1905 but kept separate political funds and their own party organisations until a complete merger between the Liberal Unionist and the Conservative parties was agreed to in May 1912.

==History==

===Formation===

The Liberal Unionists owe their origins to the conversion of William Ewart Gladstone to the cause of Irish Home Rule (i.e. limited self-government for Ireland). The 1885 general election had left Charles Stewart Parnell&#x27;s Irish Nationalists holding the balance of power, and had convinced Gladstone that the Irish wanted and deserved instatement of Home Rule for Ireland and so reform the 85 years of union. Some Liberals believed that Gladstone&#x27;s Home Rule bill would lead to independence for Ireland and the dissolution of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which they could not countenance. Seeing themselves as defenders of the Union, they called themselves &quot;Liberal Unionists&quot;, although at this stage most of them did not think the split from their former colleagues would be permanent. Gladstone preferred to call them &quot;dissentient Liberals&quot; as if he believed they would eventually come back like the &quot;Adullamites&quot;, Liberals who had opposed the extension of the franchise in 1866 but had mostly come back to the main party after the Conservatives had passed their own electoral reform bill in 1867. In the end it did not matter what the Liberal Unionists were called, the schism in the Liberal Party grew wider and deeper within a few years.

The majority of Liberal Unionists, including Hartington, Lord Lansdowne, and George Goschen, were drawn from the Whig faction of the party and had been expected to split from the Liberal Party anyway, for reasons connected with economic and social policy. Some of the Unionists held extensive landed estates in Ireland and feared these would be broken up or confiscated if Ireland had its own government, while Hartington had suffered a personal loss at the hands of Irish Nationalists in 1882 when his brother was killed during the Phoenix Park Murders.

The anti-Home Rule Liberals formed a Committee for the Preservation of the Union in early 1886, and were soon joined by a smaller radical faction led by Joseph Chamberlain and John Bright. Chamberlain had briefly taken office in the Gladstone government which had been formed in 1886 but resigned when he saw the details of Gladstone&#x27;s Home Rule plans. As Chamberlain had previously been a standard bearer of radical liberalism against the Whigs, his adherence to the alliance against the Gladstonian Liberals came as a surprise. When the dissident Liberals eventually formed the Liberal Unionist Council, which was to become the Liberal Unionist party, Chamberlain organised the separate National Radical Union in Birmingham. This allowed Chamberlain and his immediate allies to distance themselves from the main body of Liberal Unionism (and their Conservative allies) and left open the possibility that they could work with the Liberal Party in the future.

In 1889 the National Radical Union changed its name to the National Liberal Union and remained a separate organisation from the main Liberal Unionist Council.

Historian Robert Ensor reports that after 1886, Gladstone&#x27;s main Liberal Party was deserted by practically the entire Whig peerage and the great majority of the upper-class and upper-middle-class Liberals. Gentlemen&#x27;s clubs that had a Liberal base were deeply split. Ensor notes that &quot;London society, following the known views of the Queen, practically ostracized home rulers&quot;.

Chamberlain used anti-Catholicism to build a base for the new party among &quot;Orange&quot; Nonconformist Protestant elements in Britain and Ireland. John Bright popularised the catchy slogan, &quot;Home rule means Rome rule.&quot;

===Break with the Liberals===

The 1886 election left the Conservatives as the largest party in the House of Commons, but without an overall majority. The leading Liberal Unionists were invited to join the Conservative Lord Salisbury&#x27;s government. Salisbury said he was even willing to let Hartington become Prime Minister of a coalition ministry but the latter declined. In part, Hartington was worried this would split the Liberal Unionists and lose them votes from pro-Unionist Liberal supporters. The Liberal Unionists, despite providing the necessary margin for Salisbury&#x27;s majority, continued to sit on the opposition benches throughout the life of the parliament, and Hartington and Chamberlain uneasily shared the opposition Front Bench with their former colleagues Gladstone and Harcourt.

In December 1886, when Lord Randolph Churchill suddenly resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Salisbury offered the position to George Goschen, by far the most conservative of the leading Liberal Unionists. After consulting Hartington, Goschen agreed to join the Conservative government and remained Chancellor for the next six years.

===The Unionist Coalition===
While the Whiggish wing of the Liberal Unionists cooperated informally with the Conservative Government (and supplied it with a cabinet minister), the party&#x27;s Radical Unionist wing held a series of meetings with their former Liberal colleagues. Led by Chamberlain and Sir George Trevelyan, the Round Table Conference was an attempt to see if reunion of the Liberal Party was possible. Despite some progress (and Chamberlain&#x27;s statement that they were united on ninety-nine out of a hundred issues), the problem of Home Rule for Ireland could not be resolved. Neither Hartington nor Gladstone took a direct part in these meetings, and there seemed to be no other Liberal statesman who could reunite the party. Within a few months the talks were over, though some Liberal Unionists, including Trevelyan, later rejoined the Liberal Party soon after.

The failed talks of 1887 forced the Liberal Unionists to continue to develop their links with the Conservatives. In Parliament, they supported the Salisbury administration, though they sat on the opposition benches alongside the Liberals. Hostile feelings between the former political colleagues hardened with the return of Gladstone as Prime Minister, following the 1892 general election. Forming a minority government (with Irish Nationalist parliamentary support), the Liberals introduced the second Home Rule bill. Leading the opposition to the Bill were Hartington (now the Duke of Devonshire) and Chamberlain. The Bill was defeated in the House of Lords by a massive majority of Conservative and Liberal Unionist peers.

By now all chance of a reunion between the Liberals and Liberal Unionists had disappeared, and it was no great surprise when leading Liberal Unionists joined Salisbury&#x27;s new administration in 1895 following the heavy electoral defeat inflicted on the Liberal Party. The resulting government was generally referred to as &quot;Unionist&quot;, and the distinction between Conservatives and Liberal Unionists began to dissolve, though the latter were still able to field around 100 candidates for all the subsequent general elections until the December 1910 general election when that total dropped to 75.

Though a few Liberal Unionists like Goschen formally joined the Conservatives (by becoming member of the exclusively Tory Carlton Club), the party still continued to maintain a separate identity and to raise their own funds. Their strength in the House of Commons fell from 78 seats in 1886 to 47 in 1892 but recovered to 71 and then 68 in the general elections of 1895 and 1900. The Liberal Unionists managed to stay strong in the south-west of England, the West Midlands (the centre of Chamberlain&#x27;s power base), and especially in Scotland, where the Liberal Unionists were initially the more dominant group in their alliance with the Scottish Conservatives against the Liberals.

===Protectionism vs Free trade===

From the start, there was tension within the Liberal Unionists between the moderate Whigs, such as Devonshire, and the more radical Chamberlainites. While both factions opposed Home Rule, there was little else that united them, and a separate Liberal Unionist identity was hard to define in the politics of the late 1890s. Weak local party associations were encouraged to amalgamate with their Conservative allies, though Devonshire&#x27;s wish to merge fully was rejected by Chamberlain.

Despite these tensions, the Liberal Unionists more or less managed to stay together until 1903, when in a surprise move, Chamberlain dramatically launched tariff reform with a speech in his Birmingham political homeland. This departure from Free trade (i.e. no tariff barriers) caused immediate problems within the Unionist alliance, but especially with the Devonshire section of the Liberal Unionists. Rejecting tariff reform, Devonshire and other supporters of Free Trade left the Liberal Unionist Association in May 1904 in protest. Chamberlain took over the party&#x27;s leadership, but this did not stop a large number of disgruntled Liberal Unionists, including a few MPs, migrating back to the Liberal Party. As for Devonshire and his allies, they put their political efforts into the Unionist Free Trade League (also called the Free Food League) which included a sizeable minority of Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) including, for a few months, Conservative MP Winston Churchill before he too defected to the Liberals in 1904. Most of them eventually left the party while Devonshire ended his political career estranged from both main parties and appears to have sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

In the 1906 general election, the Liberal Unionists (both Free Traders and Tariff Reformers) shared the same fate as their Conservative allies, with a big reduction in their parliamentary strength. They now numbered only 23 MPs (or 25 according to other calculations) in a combined Unionist alliance of just 157 in the new House of Commons – though in Birmingham the Liberal Unionist and Conservative candidates won all the seats available.

With a few exceptions, the remaining Liberal Unionists were now firm supporters of tariffs, as were now the majority of the Conservative MPs. Indeed, for a short period in early 1906, Chamberlain was the de facto leader of the Unionist alliance in the House of Commons, as the Conservative party leader, and former Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour had lost his seat in the election (though he soon managed to return to parliament after a conveniently-arranged by-election).

It was possible that at this stage Chamberlain could have become leader of all the surviving Unionists (at least all those in favour of tariff reform) and force Balfour to resign. However, even protectionist Tories were reluctant to choose Chamberlain as their leader, not having forgotten how, as a Liberal, in the 1880s, he had been one of their sternest critics. Also, in an age when religious identification still mattered, Chamberlain was not a member of the established Church of England but belonged to the minority Unitarians.

Chamberlain could, perhaps, have led the Unionists despite these drawbacks, but in July 1906 he suffered a stroke, which left him physically crippled. He remained semi-politically active and continued as the official leader of the Liberal Unionists, but his son Austen Chamberlain and Lansdowne effectively acted on his behalf in both the party and the Tariff Reform League.

Devonshire died in 1908 but, despite the loss of the party&#x27;s two most famous standard bearers, the Liberal Unionists were still able to increase their parliamentary representation in the two 1910 general elections to 43 and then 49 MPs. 

===Fusion with the Conservatives===
The issue of tariff reform had now become overshadowed by the revived threat of Home Rule for Ireland, as the Parliament Act 1911 effectively stripped the House of Lords of its ability to veto it, while leaving it with delaying powers. This encouraged a movement to merge the two parties formally at the constituency and national organizational levels, a process speeded up by the election in 1911 of Bonar Law as the new Conservative Party leader. An effective merger had already happened to some extent in Ireland, with the Irish Unionist Party and the separately organized Ulster Unionist Council in 1905, later formally to become the Ulster Unionist Party. Outside Scotland and the English city of Birmingham, many local Liberal Unionists and Conservatives had already formed joint constituency associations in the previous decade.

In May 1912 the formal merger of the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists was finally accomplished to form the Conservative and Unionist Party, now usually called the Conservative Party. Although by 1912 the political distinctions between the two parties had long ceased to have any real meaning, they had been a residual factor in Austen Chamberlain&#x27;s failure to become the Unionist leader in the House of Commons in 1911. When Arthur Balfour resigned, Austen Chamberlain and Walter Hume Long both declared themselves as candidates for the leadership of the Unionist Party in the Commons. However, as Austen Chamberlain was still officially at least a Liberal Unionist, his candidature was opposed by many Conservatives, because they already had the Liberal Unionist Lord Lansdowne leading them in the House of Lords. In the end, Bonar Law was elected unopposed by Unionist Members, and Austen Chamberlain would have to wait ten years for his chance to lead the united party.

Following the merger, the party remained officially distinct in Scotland as the Unionist Party, though its MPs sat with the Conservatives and were part of the Conservative Party in all but name only; the Scottish party finally officially merged with its English counterpart in 1965.

===Legacy===
The political impact of the Liberal Unionist breakaway marked the end of the long nineteenth century domination by the Liberal Party of the British political scene. From 1830 to 1886 the Liberals (the name the Whigs, Radicals and Peelites accepted as their political label after 1859) had been managed to become almost the party of permanent government with just a couple of Conservative interludes. After 1886, it was the Conservatives who enjoyed this position and they received a huge boost with their electoral and political alliance with a party of disaffected Liberals.

Though not numerous, the Liberal Unionists boasted having the vast bulk of the old Whig aristocracy within their ranks, as represented by the stolid &quot;old money&quot; Duke of Devonshire. Another example is Frederick Leveson-Gower. The Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s political partner, the Radical Joseph Chamberlain, was from a very different &quot;new money&quot; background, a businessman and a Unitarian. Though he had joined the Liberal Unionists late on, he was more determined to maintain their separate status in the alliance with the Conservatives, perhaps hoping and wishing that he would be able to refashion the combination under his own leadership at a later date. Chamberlain&#x27;s stroke in 1906 robbed him of this chance, though he remained involved in political life until 1914.

Though the Liberal Unionist party disappeared as a separate organisation in 1912, the Chamberlain legacy helped keep the industrial powerhouse of Birmingham from returning to the Liberal Party and would only be changed in 1945 in the Labour Party electoral landslide of that year. It also remained a profound influence on Chamberlain&#x27;s sons Austen and Neville Chamberlain, who, when he was elected leader of the Conservative Party and thus became Prime Minister in 1937, told an audience how proud he was of his Liberal Unionist roots. This isn&#x27;t surprising. Neither Neville or Austen actually stood for Parliament as &#x27;Conservative&#x27; candidates. Their local political association in Birmingham preferred to call themselves Unionist rather than Conservative during this time and campaigned as such. The Unionist label privately suited Neville Chamberlain as well. He confided to his own family how he always regarded the Conservative party label as &#x27;odious&#x27; and thought of it a barrier to people joining what he thought could be a non-socialist but a reforming party during the 1930s which Chamberlain hoped would be called National to include the parties of the National Government coalition in the 1930s.

==Electoral performance==
==Historiography==
Iain Sharpe argues that for many years historians largely ignored the party or mentioned it as introducing a new class division to British party politics. Scholars since 1970 have dropped this class conflict approach. They see the Liberal Unionists as motivated primarily by ideology not class. For example, W. C. Lubenow finds no correlation between Liberal MPs&#x27; class background and their position on home rule. Jonathan Parry and T. A. Jenkins have separately argued that Gladstone&#x27;s domineering leadership, his intense religiosity and his pandering to public opinion alienated the more secular and rationalist outlook of many Liberals. Ian Cawood portrays the Liberal Unionists as a distinct and vital political force, at least until 1895 when they entered coalition with the Conservatives.

==In popular culture and the media==
In Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; there is an exchange between Jack Worthing and Lady Bracknell about his suitability as a match for her daughter Gwendolen.

:LADY BRACKNELL : [Sternly]... What are your politics?

:JACK: Well, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.

:LADY BRACKNELL: Oh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at any rate.

The play was first performed at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre London on 14 February 1895 and ran for 83 performances. Jack Worthing&#x27;s declaration that he was in essence apolitical but – if pressed – would say Liberal Unionist was a joke that would have appealed to the audiences that saw the play in that period. As a party that depended on an electoral pact with the Tories to maintain their MPs in parliament, the Liberal Unionists had to at least appear to be also &#x27;Liberal&#x27; in matters not connected with Home Rule including some measures of promoting reform. To someone like Jack, the Liberal Unionists&#x27; attempts to be two things at the same time but in different places would have appealed with his double identity (&#x27;Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country&#x27;, he says in act 1).

Since 1895 the then topical &#x27;Liberal Unionist&#x27; reference has caused some problems with later productions of the play. Usually the line is retained – despite its reference to a long dead political issue (and also party) but it was altered or omitted in at least two film versions of the play.

In 1952 film version directed by Anthony Asquith (the son of a former British Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith) Jack answers that he is a &#x27;Liberal&#x27; rather than &#x27;Liberal Unionist&#x27;. Lady Bracknell&#x27;s answer remains the same. In 1952 this comment was applicable to the then Liberal Party&#x27;s precarious political position, whose few remaining MPs were largely in constituencies where the Conservative Party refused to stand for fear of splitting an established Liberal vote and letting in the Labour Party. Since then, many adaptations of the play have kept this brief mention of the obscure political party. However, in the 2002 film version which starred Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Rupert Everett and Reese Witherspoon – the lines were dropped yet episodes and characters in an earlier version of the play that Wilde had been encouraged to drop before the play&#x27;s first performance were re-incorporated.

He played his first football at Hucknall Town, before being signed by Stuart Watkiss at Mansfield Town.

He was released, by the then manager, Keith Curle and then joined Championship side Crewe Alexandra. When he was released by Crewe, Gudjon Thordarson signed him for Notts County.

In June 2006 White re-joined Kidderminster Harriers on a one-year contract. In March 2007 he joined Stafford Rangers on a short-term loan deal. White was then released by Kidderminster at the end of the 2006-07 season.

<text>The Battle of Narva (, ; ) on (20 November in the Swedish transitional calendar) was an early battle in the Great Northern War. A Swedish relief army under Charles XII of Sweden defeated a Russian siege force three to four times its size. Previously, Charles XII had forced Denmark–Norway to sign the Treaty of Travendal. Narva was not followed by further advances of the Swedish army into Russia; instead, Charles XII turned southward to expel August the Strong from Livonia and Poland–Lithuania. Tsar Peter the Great of Russia took Narva in a second battle in 1704.

== Background ==
During the 17th century, Russia was less advanced technologically than the rest of Europe, a condition which extended to its armed forces. Despite this shortcoming, Peter the Great of Russia was keen to get &quot;an adequate opening to the Baltic&quot; by conquering parts of Sweden&#x27;s Baltic provinces that Russia had lost during the Time of Troubles. However, there was a problem: while most states&#x27; armies of the time consisted of poorly trained militia and small contingents of mercenaries, Sweden had a professional army, one of the largest and most disciplined of northern Europe.

Peter the Great would drastically modernize Russia in the coming years, but the army with which he traveled in 1700 was still poorly drilled. Preparing for war, he decided to form 31 new regiments. At the same time, in the spring of 1700, a revision of the officer corps was made whereby most officers were sent into retirement or to garrison units to serve without pay. A catastrophic shortage of command personnel (up to 70% at the company level) resulted. The vacancies were filled with young Moscow noblemen who had neither the experience of command nor the experience of service in the infantry nor regular military training—their traditional places were elite irregular cavalry or court service. Non-commissioned officers also experienced serious problems—they were not veteran soldiers but were elected from recruits.

== Prelude ==
Russia made a military alliance with Frederick IV, King of Denmark–Norway; and Augustus the Strong, King of Poland–Lithuania and elector of Saxony, to wage war against Sweden whereupon three countries attacked Sweden from different directions. The Danish and Saxon armies acted indecisively, bounding themselves to unsuccessful sieges of fortresses. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth refused to support its king, and Russia waited for a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire to transfer its struggle from south to north.

Charles XII, assisted by the Royal Navy and the Dutch Navy, first landed in Humlebæk north of Copenhagen and forced Denmark-Norway to leave the alliance in August 1700 (until 1709). He then moved part of the Swedish army across the Baltic Sea to Estonia, where Estonian and Finnish regiments of the Swedish army joined it.

During November, Russian troops surrounded the city of Narva in Estonia (part of the Swedish Empire at the time), attempting to secure its surrender via siege. August II commanded a Saxon-Polish army, and Steinau was outside Riga in Swedish Livonia. The Saxon-Polish army, however, had gone into winter camp south of the river Daugava. Hence, Charles XII decided to deal with the more immediate Russian threat against Narva, which was under siege by Peter&#x27;s forces.

==High command==
The Swedish army was commanded personally by Charles XII, assisted by Lieutenant-General Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld and General of the cavalry Otto Vellingk. During the Scanian War in 1675–1679, Vellingk was already a colonel and commanded a cavalry regiment, and Rehnskiöld rose from lieutenant to lieutenant-colonel. Both also had the experience of service in foreign armies: Vellingk served for ten years in France, during which he rose to the rank of colonel, and Rehnskiöld participated in the Franco-Dutch War (1688—1697). From 1698 Vellingk was a governor in Ingermanland and at the beginning of the Great Northern War commanded a small corps, sent to help besieged Riga.

Peter and Charles Eugène de Croÿ commanded the Russian forces. Peter had left Narva just the day before and was not present during the actual fighting. Trying to explain this act, some historians suggest that he did not expect an immediate attack on his well-fortified and numerically superior force, or he was sure that such an attack would be easily repulsed. It is suggested that Peter wanted to speed up the arrival of reinforcements, address supply issues, and negotiate with Augustus. Some interpretations consider his departure from Narva the night before the battle as cowardly; most of Europe mocked the Tsar for his departure. However, some scholars believe this accusation has little merit, as reportedly, the Tsar had placed himself in physical danger too many times for this departure to be an act of cowardice.

Peter not only left the army on the eve of the battle but also took with him the formal commander-in-chief—Field Marshal Fyodor Golovin. The new commander-in-chief, de Croÿ, was not at all a Russian general—August II sent him with a diplomatic mission (he asked for an auxiliary Russian corps) and met with Peter in Novgorod only on . Due to a lack of experienced commanders, Peter retained de Croÿ with him; they reconnoitered the fortifications of Narva together, but de Croÿ did not hold any official post and never before commanded any unit of the Russian army. De Croÿ refused to accept the command several times and relented only after Peter personally &quot;strengthened his resolve with a glass of wine&quot;. This happened only the day before the battle, and the official instruction for the transfer of command was dated , &quot;i.e.&quot;, when the Swedish relief force arrived at Narva.

The Russian army near Narva was divided into three main parts (&quot;general&#x27;stvo&quot;), commanded by Avtonom Golovin, Trubetskoy, and Weide. All of them were young men (born in 1667), and their combat experience was limited to the two sieges of the Turkish fortress of Azov, but they had served in Peter&#x27;s favorite poteshnye voiska. More experienced generals were sent to command remote garrisons. A popular commander, Sheremetev, known for his successful actions against Turks, had no rank in the hierarchy of the regular army and was ordered to command the feudal levy cavalry.

The Swedish artillery was commanded by experienced Master-General of the Ordnance . He had almost forty years of service in artillery and was an author of the first Swedish Artillery Regulation of 1690. Massie notes the excellent actions of the Swedish artillery in the skirmish at Pyhajoggi Pass, eighteen miles west of Narva. Under the screen of their dragoons, the cannons were quickly deployed and suddenly opened fire on the clusters of Russian cavalry from a close distance. Since the Russians had no artillery at Pyhajoggi, they could not hold this advantageous position and had to retreat.

The formal commander of Russian artillery was Prince Alexander of Imereti, a young man of 26, a close companion of Peter in his entourage. His experience was limited to several months studying the theoretical foundations of gunnery in The Hague in 1697. After his return to Moscow, he soon received the highest artillery rank of General Feldzeugmeister (May 1700). There is much evidence of the extremely unsuccessful actions of Russian siege artillery against Narva.

== Battle ==
===Preparations===
On the afternoon of , Charles XII approached the village of Lagena, 7 miles from Narva, and made a final inspection of his army. Charles was not sure if Narva was still holding, so he ordered to give the Swedish recognition signal by cannon shots and then got the same response from the fortress. Earlier, the Sheremetev&#x27;s cavalry joined the main forces. Thus, the Russian siege camp was warned about the enemy&#x27;s approach. De Croÿ inspected the army and ordered it to increase vigilance, prepare firearms, and keep half of the army on alert throughout the night. On the morning of the next day, &quot;before sunrise,&quot; it was ordered to give soldiers the charges and build the entire army. Among other instructions was the prohibition against opening fire earlier than 20–30 steps to the enemy.

On 19 (OS) or 30 (NS) November 1700 (20 November in the Swedish transitional calendar), Charles XII positioned his 10,500 men (another 2,000 men were garrisoned in the city and would take part in the battle at a later stage) opposite the besieging Russian army of about 34,000 to 40,000 troops.

The Swedes approached the Russian army at 10 a.m. and began to prepare for an attack. Charles and his generals examined the Russian position, and the soldiers stored the fascines to overcome the ditches surrounding it. De Croÿ was concerned about the small size of the Swedish army and suspected that this was only the vanguard of the main forces. Sheremetev proposed to lead the army out of the entrenchment in the field and attack the Swedes but was not supported by other generals. De Croÿ decided to leave the army stretched for and sandwiched between two rows of ramparts. The space between the ramparts was uneven: about on the right Russian flank, about in the center, and on the left flank – only . There were many barracks for soldiers between the ramparts, which made it difficult to maneuver.

In the center of the Russian position was the Goldenhof Hill, fenced on all sides by barracks and sharpened stakes (&quot;the chevaux de frise&quot;) and adapted to all-around defence. Charles divided his infantry into two parts and directed them to the north and south of the Goldenhof Hill. On the right (southern) flank were 11 &quot;field&quot; battalions under the command of Vellingk. On the left (northern) flank were 10 &quot;field&quot; battalions under the command of Rehnskiöld, including a small column of two battalions under the command of Magnus Stenbock, where Charles was himself. Grenadiers with fascines marched in the vanguard of the infantry columns. The Swedish cavalry (≈4,300 men) covered the flanks of the infantry and had to prevent Russian attempts to exit the fortifications. The Swedish artillery (37 guns at all), located on a small rise, bombarded the places planned for the attack.

The exact battle order of the Russian army is unknown – Russian documents are not preserved, and the Swedish data are contradictory. It is known that the &quot;division&quot; (&quot;general&#x27;stvo&quot;) of Trubetskoy was located in the center. It was the weakest part of the three main divisions: there were only two &quot;regular&quot; infantry regiments, and they were even worse drilled than the rest – they were formed as late as August 1700, and in September, Trubetskoy already marched to Narva. Trubetskoy also had four weak regiments of local &quot;streltsy&quot; from Novgorod and Pskov garrisons and, may be, there were two regular infantry regiments temporarily separated from other divisions.

===Action===

By afternoon, the Swedes had finished their preparations and moved forward at 2 p.m. At that moment, it got colder, the wind changed, and the snowstorm blew directly into the eyes of the Russians. Some Swedish officers asked to postpone the attack until the end of the storm. Still, Charles saw his opportunity and advanced on the Russian army under cover of the weather.
The Swedes attacked with two highly dense shock groups, quickly approached the Russian positions, and gave a volley, after which the Russians &quot;fell like grass&quot;. At first, the Russians vigorously resisted: &quot;They returned a heavy fire and killed many fine fellows&quot;, but within 15 minutes, the Swedes filled the ditches with fascines, broke into the fortifications with cold steel arms, and &quot;a terrible massacre&quot; began.

Acting according to the plan, the Swedes moved south and north along the fortification line, rolling up the Russian defense. They attacked inexperienced Russian regiments and shattered them one by one. There was panic and chaos; Russian soldiers began killing foreign officers, and de Croÿ, with his staff, hurried to surrender. Masses of panicking Russians troops rushed to the only Kamperholm Bridge over the Narva River, located at the northern edge of the defensive line. At one crucial point, the bridge collapsed under retreating Russian troops.

On the right (northern) flank of the Russians, only two regiments of the future Guards (Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky) retained the battle order. They rebuilt in a square, arranged improvised barricades of wagons, and stubbornly held on; some running soldiers joined them. Karl led the attacks against this center of resistance, encouraging his troops, but they were repulsed, and a horse under Karl was killed. Most of the Russian commanders, including generals Golovin and Trubetskoy, managed to join this group despite the surrender of de Croÿ. On the left flank, General Weide was seriously wounded at the very beginning of the battle, but his &quot;division&quot; for the most part did not succumb to panic and even made a successful counterattack, but could not reconnect with the rest of the army.

===Capitulation===

After the first clash, the high command of the Russian army lost its morale and decided to capitulate. The Swedes, in turn, were exhausted and could not finish off those parts of the Russians who did not succumb to panic and kept their ground. The right flank of the Russian army capitulated faster on a free exit with weapons and colours, but general Weide on the left flank capitulated later and was already forced to hand over weapons and banners. All the artillery and wagon-trains also fell into the hands of the Swedes.

The Swedes and the Russians repaired the Kamperholm Bridge through which capitulated troops crossed to the right bank of the Narva River. The highest Russian commanders remained with the Swedes, initially as hostages, to ensure the fulfillment of the terms of surrender. But later, Charles violated the treaty and kept them as prisoners. The Swedes explained this act by not receiving the army treasury. Sheremetev with his cavalry marched to the south along the left bank of Narva river to &quot;Syrensk&quot;, crossed the river on the bridge there and thus escaped captivity.

===Results===
The Battle of Narva was a terrible defeat for the Russian army. The Swedes captured ten generals and ten colonels, and many Russian regimental officers were killed in battle. The Russian regimental rolls from January 1701 show that the total loss of personnel was about 25% (with a 57–68% loss in the two regular infantry regiments of Trubetskoy&#x27;s &quot;division&quot;). In Golovin&#x27;s &quot;division&quot; (excluding the two Guard regiments), only 250 of the 356 officers survived. Weide&#x27;s &quot;division&quot;, however, fared somewhat better. The Russians also suffered heavy losses in armaments, as the Swedes captured 4050 muskets and 173 artillery pieces, including 64 siege cannons. Soon thereafter, the Swedes took an additional 22 mortars from a baggage train near &quot;Yam&quot;. While the Russians had mostly replenished their small arms by the spring of 1701, the former Golovin and Weide &quot;divisions&quot; still lacked regimental artillery. If Charles had continued the campaign against Russia (as General Vellingk had suggested attacking Novgorod and Pskov), the Russian army very likely would have suffered another defeat.

==Memory==
=== Russian memorial ===
In 1900, 200 years after the battle of Narva, the Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky regiments initiated the construction of a memorial to the Russian soldiers who had fallen in the Battle of Narva. The memorial consists of a granite pedestal with a cross on top, placed on a mound of earth. The inscription says: &quot;Our heroic ancestors who fell in November 1700.&quot;

=== Victory monument ===
On 20 November 2000, the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lena Hjelm Wallén inaugurated a new memorial monument to celebrate the victory. Erected with an economic contribution from the Swedish Institute, it replaced an older memorial erected in 1936, which disappeared during the Second World War. The monument is surmounted by a &quot;Swedish lion&quot;, his left paw resting on a ball engraved with the Three Crowns of Sweden. It stands on a pedestal of granite. The Latin inscription on the pedestal reads &quot;&quot;MDCC&quot; (1700) and &quot;Svecia memor&quot;&quot; (&quot;Sweden remembers&quot;).

== Second siege ==

Four years after the Narva battle, Peter I marched again in a new attempt to capture Narva. Marshal Boris Sheremetev&#x27;s force of 20,000 captured Tartu on 24 June. Sheremetev then besieged Narva, where the garrison was under Commandant Major-General Henning Rudolf Horn af Ranzien and consisted of 3,800 infantry and 1,300 cavalry. The Russians captured Narva on 20 August 1704 and massacred some of its Swedish inhabitants before Peter I stopped them. Horn, several officers, and a large number of Swedish soldiers were captured, with about 3,200 casualties while the Russians lost up to 3,000 men during the siege and the assault.

<text>Let It Be is the twelfth and final studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, nearly a month after the official announcement of the group&#x27;s public break-up, in tandem with the documentary of the same name. Concerned about recent friction within the band, Paul McCartney had conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the group by returning to simpler rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll configurations. Its rehearsals started at Twickenham Film Studios on 2 January 1969 as part of a planned television documentary showcasing the Beatles&#x27; return to live performance.

The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill feeling, leading to George Harrison&#x27;s temporary departure from the group. As a condition of his return, the members reconvened at their own Apple Studio, and recruited guest keyboardist Billy Preston. Together, they performed a single public concert on the studio&#x27;s rooftop on 30 January, from which three of the album&#x27;s tracks were drawn. In April, the Beatles issued the lead single &quot;Get Back&quot;, backed with &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, after which engineer Glyn Johns prepared and submitted mixes of the album, then titled &quot;Get Back&quot;, which the band rejected. As bootlegs of these mixes circulated widely among fans, the project lay in limbo, and the group moved on to the recording of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, released that September.

In January 1970, four months after John Lennon departed from the band, the remaining Beatles completed &quot;Let It Be&quot; and recorded &quot;I Me Mine&quot;. The former was issued as the second single from the album with production by George Martin. When the documentary film was resurrected for a cinema release, as &quot;Let It Be&quot;, Lennon and Harrison asked American producer Phil Spector to assemble the accompanying album. Among Spector&#x27;s choices was to include a 1968 take of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and apply orchestral and choral overdubs to &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. His work offended McCartney, particularly in the case of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, which was the third and final single of the album.

&quot;Let It Be&quot; topped record charts in several countries, including both the UK and the US. However, it was a critical failure at the time, and came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums in history, though retrospective reception has been more positive. In 2003, McCartney spearheaded &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;, an alternative version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; that removes Spector&#x27;s embellishments and alters the tracklist. In 2021, another remixed and expanded edition of &quot;Let It Be&quot; was released with session highlights and the original 1969 &quot;Get Back&quot; mix, coinciding with &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;, an eight-hour documentary series covering the January 1969 sessions and rooftop concert.

==Background==
The Beatles completed the five-month sessions for their self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) in mid-October 1968. While the sessions had revealed deep divisions within the group for the first time, leading to Ringo Starr quitting for three weeks, the band enjoyed the opportunity to re-engage with ensemble playing, as a departure from the psychedelic experimentation that had characterised their recordings since the band&#x27;s retirement from live performance in August 1966. Before the White Album&#x27;s release, John Lennon enthused to music journalist Jonathan Cott that the Beatles were &quot;coming out of our shell ... kind of saying: remember what it was like to &quot;play&quot;?&quot; George Harrison welcomed the return to the band&#x27;s roots, saying that they were aiming &quot;to get as funky as we were in the Cavern&quot;.

Concerned about the friction over the previous year, Paul McCartney was eager for the Beatles to perform live again. In early October 1968, he told the press that the band would soon play a live show for subsequent broadcast in a TV special. The following month, Apple Corps announced that the Beatles had booked the Roundhouse in north London for 12–23 December and would perform at least one concert during that time. When this plan came to nothing, Denis O&#x27;Dell, the head of Apple Films, suggested that the group be filmed rehearsing at Twickenham Film Studios, in preparation for their return to live performance, since he had booked studio space there to shoot &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;.

The initial plan was that the rehearsal footage would be edited into a short TV documentary promoting the main TV special, in which the Beatles would perform a public concert or perhaps two concerts. Michael Lindsay-Hogg had agreed to direct the project, having worked with the band on some of their promotional films. The project&#x27;s timeline was dictated by Harrison being away in the United States until Christmas and Starr&#x27;s commitment to begin filming his role in &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; in February 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/Mojo&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; The band intended to perform only new material and were therefore under pressure to finish writing an album&#x27;s worth of songs. Although the concert venue was not established when rehearsals began on 2 January, it was decided that the 18th would serve as a potential dress rehearsal day; the 19th and 20th would serve as concert dates.

==Recording and production==
===Twickenham rehearsals===

The Twickenham rehearsals quickly disintegrated into what Apple Corps executive Peter Brown characterised as a &quot;hostile lethargy&quot;. Lennon and his partner Yoko Ono had descended into heroin addiction after their arrest on drugs charges in October and Ono&#x27;s subsequent miscarriage. Unable to supply his quota of new songs for the project, Lennon maintained an icy distance from his bandmates and scorned McCartney&#x27;s ideas. By contrast, Harrison was inspired by his recent stay in the US; there, he enjoyed jamming with musicians in Los Angeles and experienced a musical camaraderie and creative freedom with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York that was lacking in the Beatles. Harrison presented several new songs for consideration at Twickenham, some of which were dismissed by Lennon and McCartney. McCartney&#x27;s attempts to focus the band on their objective were construed as overly controlling, particularly by Harrison.

The atmosphere in the film studios, the early start each day, and the intrusive cameras and microphones of Lindsay-Hogg&#x27;s film crew combined to heighten the Beatles&#x27; discontent. When the band rehearsed McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Two of Us&quot; on 6 January, a tense exchange ensued between McCartney and Harrison about the latter&#x27;s lead guitar part. During lunch on 10 January, Lennon and Harrison had a heated disagreement in which Harrison berated Lennon for his lack of engagement with the project. Harrison was also angry with Lennon for telling a music journalist that the Beatles&#x27; Apple organisation was in financial ruin. According to journalist Michael Housego&#x27;s report in the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, Harrison and Lennon&#x27;s exchange descended into violence with the pair allegedly throwing punches at each other. Harrison denied this in a 16 January interview for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, saying: &quot;There was no punch-up. We just fell out.&quot; After lunch on 10 January, Harrison announced that he was leaving the band and told the others, &quot;See you round the clubs.&quot; Starr attributed Harrison&#x27;s exit to McCartney &quot;dominating&quot; him.

===Apple sessions===
During a meeting on 15 January, the band agreed to Harrison&#x27;s terms for returning to the group: they would abandon the plan to stage a public concert and move from the cavernous soundstage at Twickenham to their Apple Studio, where they would be filmed recording a new album, using the material they had gathered to that point. The band&#x27;s return to work was delayed by the poor quality of the recording and mixing equipment designed by Lennon&#x27;s friend &quot;Magic&quot; Alex Mardas and installed at Apple Studio, in the basement of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row. Producer George Martin, who had been only a marginal presence at Twickenham, arranged to borrow two four-track recorders from EMI Studios; he and audio engineer Glyn Johns then prepared the facility for the Beatles&#x27; use.

Sessions (and filming) at Apple began on 21 January. The atmosphere in the band was markedly improved. To help achieve this, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate, after meeting him outside the Apple building on 22 January. Preston contributed to most of the recording and also became an Apple Records artist. McCartney and Lindsay-Hogg continued to hope for a public concert by the Beatles to cap the project. 

=== Rooftop concert ===

According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, it is uncertain who thought of a rooftop concert, but the idea was conceived just days before the actual event. In Preston&#x27;s recollection, it was John Lennon who suggested it.

Until the last minute, according to Lindsay-Hogg, the Beatles were still undecided about performing the concert. He recalled that on 30 January, they had discussed it and then gone silent, until &quot;John said in the silence, &#x27;Fuck it – let&#x27;s go do it. The four Beatles and Preston arrived on the roof at around 12:30 pm. When they began to play, there was confusion nearby among members of the public, many of whom were on their lunch break. As the news of the event spread, crowds began to congregate in the streets and on the flat rooftops of nearby buildings.

Police officers ascended to the roof just as the Beatles began the second take of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;. The concert came to an end with the conclusion of &quot;Get Back&quot;.

Recording of the project (and filming) wrapped on 31 January.

===&quot;Get Back&quot; mixes===

In early March, Lennon and McCartney called Johns to Abbey Road and offered him free rein to compile an album from the &quot;Get Back&quot; recordings. Johns booked time at Olympic Studios between 10 March and 28 May to mix the album and completed the final banded master tape on 28 May. Only one track, &quot;One After 909&quot;, was taken from the rooftop concert, with &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; and &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; (then called &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;) being studio recordings instead. Johns also favoured earlier, rougher versions of &quot;Two of Us&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; over the more polished performances from the final, 31 January session (which were eventually chosen for the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film; the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album used the 31 January take of &quot;Two of Us&quot; but the same 26 January take of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; that Johns had used). It also included a jam called &quot;Rocker&quot;, a brief rendition of the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; and a four-minute edit of &quot;Dig It&quot;. A tape copy of this acetate would later make its way to the United States, where it was played on radio stations in Buffalo and Boston over September 1969.

The cover of the proposed album featured a photograph of the Beatles taken by Angus McBean on 13 May in the interior stairwell at EMI&#x27;s Manchester Square headquarters. The photo was intended as an update of the group&#x27;s &quot;Please Please Me&quot; cover image from 1963 and was particularly favoured by Lennon. The text design and placement similarly mirrored that of the 1963 LP sleeve. The sequencing of &quot;One After 909&quot;, a Lennon–McCartney composition from the early 1960s, as the opening track furthered the back-to-the-roots aesthetic. The Beatles rejected the album.

The &quot;Get Back&quot; album was intended for release in July 1969, but its release was pushed back to September to coincide with the planned television special and the theatrical film about the making of the album. In September, the release was pushed back to December, because the Beatles had just recorded &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and wanted to issue that album instead. On 20 September, six days before &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was released, Lennon told McCartney, Starr, and business manager Allen Klein (Harrison was not present) that he &quot;wanted a divorce&quot; from the group. By December, the &quot;Get Back&quot; album had been shelved.

On 15 December, the Beatles again approached Johns to compile an album, but this time with the instruction that the songs must match those included in the as yet unreleased &quot;Get Back&quot; film. Between 15 December 1969 and 8 January 1970, new mixes were prepared. Johns&#x27;s new mix omitted &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; as the song did not appear in the film. It added &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (a remix of the 1968 studio version, as the January 1969 rehearsals had not been properly recorded) and &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, on which only Harrison, McCartney and Starr performed, as Lennon had already left the band. &quot;I Me Mine&quot; was newly recorded on 3 January 1970, as it appeared in the film since no multi-track recording had yet been made. Johns also rearranged the playlist, moving &quot;Let It Be&quot; away from &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; onto the first side. The Beatles once again rejected the album.

=== Final mixing ===
Producer Phil Spector was invited by Lennon and Harrison to take on the task of turning the Beatles&#x27; abandoned &quot;Get Back&quot; recording sessions into a usable album. The songs &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; had been released on a single in April 1969 and &quot;Let It Be&quot; was the A-side of the band&#x27;s March 1970 single. To coincide with the single, the project was renamed &quot;Let It Be&quot;. The film, now with the new title, was premiered in New York City on 13 May 1970. One week later, UK premieres were held at the Liverpool Gaumont Cinema and the London Pavilion. None of the Beatles attended any of the premieres.

For the soundtrack album, Spector chose three tracks recorded live from the rooftop performance: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;, &quot;One After 909&quot; and &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;. &quot;Two of Us&quot; was recorded &quot;live in the studio&quot; with the band members playing together in a single take, and without overdubs or splicing. Spector included &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, which were improvised during the recordings. &quot;Get Back&quot;, on the other hand, included only the section recorded on 27 January 1969, without the coda recorded the next day, and cross-faded to the remarks at the end of the rooftop concert.

Seven of the tracks were thereby released in accordance with the original plans for the &quot;Get Back&quot; project, whereas the album versions of &quot;For You Blue&quot;, &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; include editing, splicing and/or overdubs. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, recorded live in the studio two days before the rooftop concert, was omitted from the album. &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is an edited version of the original 1968 recording, played back at a slower speed (which lowered the key from D to D♭), which had only been rehearsed at Twickenham and not professionally recorded on multi-track tape during the January 1969 sessions.

McCartney was dissatisfied with Spector&#x27;s treatment of some songs, particularly &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. McCartney had conceived of the song as a simple piano ballad, but Spector dubbed in orchestral and choral accompaniment. Lennon defended Spector&#x27;s work in his &quot;Lennon Remembers&quot; interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying, &quot;He was given the shittiest load of badly recorded shit – and with a lousy feeling to it – ever. And he made something out of it. He did a great job. When I heard it, I didn&#x27;t puke.&quot;

Lennon chose not to credit Johns for his contribution as a producer. When EMI informed Martin that he would not get a production credit because Spector produced the final version, Martin commented, &quot;I produced the original, and what you should do is have a credit saying &#x27;Produced by George Martin, over-produced by Phil Spector&#x27;.&quot;

==Packaging==
In most countries except the United States, the &quot;Let It Be&quot; LP was originally presented in a box with a full colour book. The book contained photos by Ethan Russell from the January 1969 filming, dialogue from the film, with all expletives removed at EMI&#x27;s insistence, and essays by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writers Jonathan Cott and David Dalton. Despite the new album title, the book was still titled &quot;Get Back&quot;. Its inclusion was another step in the Beatles&#x27; efforts to provide increasingly elaborate packaging for their records since &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The book&#x27;s lavishness increased production costs by 33 per cent, however, driving the retail price higher than for any previous Beatles album.

In the United States, the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album was issued in a gatefold cover and was initially distributed by United Artists Records instead of their usual Capitol Records, with the record using red-tinted Apple labels to reflect this change. (Capitol would acquire United Artists in 1979.) On both sides of the disc, the words &quot;Phil+Ronnie&quot; are inscribed into the inner dead wax.

The LP cover was designed by John Kosh and includes individual photos of the four band members, again taken by Russell. On the front cover, the photos are set in quadrants on a black surround. The album title appears in white text above the images but, as on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and other Beatles LPs, the cover does not include the band&#x27;s name. Written by Apple press officer Derek Taylor, the LP&#x27;s liner notes described &quot;Let It Be&quot; as a &quot;new phase Beatles album&quot;, adding that &quot;in come the warmth and the freshness of a live performance; as reproduced for disc by Phil Spector&quot;. Martin and Johns were among those listed for &quot;thanks to&quot;.

==Critical reception and legacy==
&quot;Let It Be&quot; topped album charts in both the US and the UK, and the &quot;Let It Be&quot; single and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; also reached number one in the US. Despite its commercial success, according to &quot;Beatles Diary&quot; author Keith Badman, &quot;reviews [were] not good&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; critic Alan Smith wrote: &quot;If the new Beatles&#x27; soundtrack is to be their last then it will stand as a cheapskate epitaph, a cardboard tombstone, a sad and tatty end to a musical fusion which wiped clean and drew again the face of pop.&quot; Smith added that the album showed &quot;contempt for the intelligence of today&#x27;s record-buyer&quot; and that the Beatles had &quot;sold out all the principles for which they ever stood&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John Mendelsohn was also critical of the album, citing Spector&#x27;s production embellishments as a weakness: &quot;Musically, boys, you passed the audition. In terms of having the judgment to avoid either over-producing yourselves or casting the fate of your get-back statement to the most notorious of all over-producers, you didn&#x27;t.&quot;

John Gabree of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine found the album &quot;not nearly as bad as the movie&quot; and &quot;positively wonderful&quot; relative to the recent solo releases by McCartney and Starr. Gabree admired &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Two of Us&quot;, but derided &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, the last of which he described as &quot;bloated and self-satisfied – the kind of song we&#x27;ve come to expect from these rich, privileged prototeenagers&quot;. While questioning whether the Beatles&#x27; split would remain permanent, William Mann of &quot;The Times&quot; described &quot;Let It Be&quot; as &quot;Not a breakthrough record, unless for the predominance of informal, unedited live takes; but definitely a record to give lasting pleasure. They aren&#x27;t having to scrape the barrel yet.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Derek Jewell deemed the album to be &quot;a last will and testament, from the blackly funereal packaging to the music itself, which sums up so much of what The Beatles as artists have been – unmatchably brilliant at their best, careless and self-indulgent at their least.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/CanUDigIt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective review, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic described &quot;Let It Be&quot; as the &quot;only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews&quot;, but felt that it was &quot;on the whole underrated&quot;. He singles out &quot;some good moments of straight hard rock in &#x27;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&#x27; and &#x27;Dig a Pony&#x27;&quot;, and praises &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;the folky &#x27;Two of Us&#x27;&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2009, Neil McCormick described &quot;Let It Be&quot; as a &quot;slightly sad postscript&quot;, adding, &quot;there are still monster tunes here by anyone else&#x27;s standards, but it lacks sonic clarity, and is peppered with under-developed, sub-standard blues.&quot;

&quot;Let It Be&quot; was ranked number 86 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, number 392 in the 2012 version, and number 342 in the 2020 edition.
It was voted number 890 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). On Metacritic, the 50th Anniversary multi-disc Super Deluxe Edition of the album holds a score of 91 out of 100, based on seven professional reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 1971, &quot;Let It Be&quot; won the Grammy Award for the Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special. It was also one of the nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus. Despite his objections to Spector&#x27;s embellishments and the expensive packaging, including the &quot;blatant hype&quot; printed on the LP&#x27;s back cover, McCartney personally accepted the band&#x27;s award. That same year, the Beatles won the Academy Award for the Best Original Song Score for the songs in the film.

In 1988, the Slovenian band Laibach released a martial industrial version of the album, also titled &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Beatles author Kenneth Womack comments on Laibach&#x27;s notable exclusion of the title track and describes the album as &quot;military style interpretations and choral pieces&quot;. For the magazine&#x27;s October 2010 issue, &quot;Mojo&quot; released &quot;Let It Be Revisited&quot;, a CD containing interpretations of the songs by acts such as Beth Orton, Phosphorescent, Judy Collins, Wilko Johnson, the Besnard Lakes, John Grant and the Jim Jones Revue.

==Reissues==
In 1976, the United Artists release of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album went out of print in America until 1979, when United Artists Records was acquired by Capitol Records. &quot;Let It Be&quot; was reissued on the Capitol label, catalogue number SW 11922; during this three year hiatus, many counterfeit copies of the LP appeared on the market in the US.

===&quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;===
Paul McCartney, long unhappy with the original Phil Spector produced &quot;Let It Be&quot; LP, initiated a remix of the album, titled &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; which was released in 2003. The album was presented as an alternative attempt to capture the original artistic vision of the project, to &quot;get back&quot; to the rock and roll sound of the band&#x27;s early years. The album features alternate takes, edits, and mixes of the songs, mainly removing elements added by Spector. The album omits the group chatter, &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot;, and adds a live rooftop performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, a song omitted from the original album and issued as the B side of the &quot;Get Back&quot; single in 1969.

===Deluxe editions===

In November 2021, &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;, a new documentary directed by Peter Jackson using footage captured for the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film, was released on Disney+ as a three-part miniseries. It was originally going to be theatrically released in 2020 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, but was delayed to November 2021 and moved to Disney+. A book also titled &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; was released in October 2021, ahead of the documentary.

A super deluxe version of the album was released on 15 October 2021.

<doc id="140538" wikidata="Q1060964" url="?curid=140538" title="Flyweight pattern">
<text>In computer programming, the flyweight software design pattern refers to an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing some of its data with other similar objects. The flyweight pattern is one of twenty-three well-known &quot;GoF design patterns&quot;. These patterns promote flexible object-oriented software design, which is easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

In other contexts, the idea of sharing data structures is called hash consing.

The term was first coined, and the idea extensively explored, by Paul Calder and Mark Linton in 1990 to efficiently handle glyph information in a WYSIWYG document editor. Similar techniques were already used in other systems, however, as early as 1988.

==Overview== 
The flyweight pattern is useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share simple repeated elements which would use a large amount of memory if they were individually embedded. It is common to hold shared data in external data structures and pass it to the objects temporarily when they are used.

A classic example are the data structures used representing characters in a word processor. Naively, each character in a document might have a glyph object containing its font outline, font metrics, and other formatting data. However, this would use hundreds or thousands of bytes of memory for each character. Instead, each character can have a reference to a glyph object shared by every instance of the same character in the document. This way, only the position of each character needs to be stored internally.

As a result, flyweight objects can: 
* store &quot;intrinsic&quot; state that is invariant, context-independent and shareable (for example, the code of character &#x27;A&#x27; in a given character set)
* provide an interface for passing in &quot;extrinsic&quot; state that is variant, context-dependent and can&#x27;t be shared (for example, the position of character &#x27;A&#x27; in a text document)

Clients can reuse codice_1 objects and pass in extrinsic state as necessary, reducing the number of physically created objects.

=== Structure ===
The above UML class diagram shows:

* the codice_2 class, which uses the flyweight pattern
*the codice_3 class, which creates and shares codice_1 objects
* the codice_1 interface, which takes in extrinsic state and performs an operation 
*the codice_6 class, which implements codice_1 and stores intrinsic state

The sequence diagram shows the following run-time interactions:

# The codice_2 object calls codice_9 on the codice_3, which returns a codice_6 object.
# After calling codice_12 on the returned codice_6 object, the codice_2 again calls codice_9 on the codice_3.
# The codice_3 returns the already-existing codice_6 object.

== Implementation details ==
There are multiple ways to implement the flyweight pattern. One example is mutability: whether the objects storing extrinsic flyweight state can change.

Immutable objects are easily shared, but require creating new extrinsic objects whenever a change in state occurs. In contrast, mutable objects can share state. Mutability allows better object reuse via the caching and re-initialization of old, unused objects. Sharing is usually nonviable when state is highly variable.

Other primary concerns include retrieval (how the end-client accesses the flyweight), caching and concurrency.

=== Retrieval === 
The factory interface for creating or reusing flyweight objects is often a facade for a complex underlying system. For example, the factory interface is commonly implemented as a singleton to provide global access for creating flyweights.

Generally speaking, the retrieval algorithm begins with a request for a new object via the factory interface.

The request is typically forwarded to an appropriate cache based on what kind of object it is. If the request is fulfilled by an object in the cache, it may be reinitialized and returned. Otherwise, a new object is instantiated. If the object is partitioned into multiple extrinsic sub-components, they will be pieced together before the object is returned.

=== Caching ===
There are two ways to cache flyweight objects: maintained and unmaintained caches.

Objects with highly variable state can be cached with a FIFO structure. This structure maintains unused objects in the cache, with no need to search the cache.

In contrast, unmaintained caches have less upfront overhead: objects for the caches are initialized in bulk at compile time or startup. Once objects populate the cache, the object retrieval algorithm might have more overhead associated than the push/pop operations of a maintained cache.

When retrieving extrinsic objects with immutable state one must simply search the cache for an object with the state one desires. If no such object is found, one with that state must be initialized. When retrieving extrinsic objects with mutable state, the cache must be searched for an unused object to reinitialize if no used object is found. If there is no unused object available, a new object must be instantiated and added to the cache.

Separate caches can be used for each unique subclass of extrinsic object. Multiple caches can be optimized separately, associating a unique search algorithm with each cache. This object caching system can be encapsulated with the chain of responsibility pattern, which promotes loose coupling between components.

=== Concurrency ===
Special consideration must be taken into account where flyweight objects are created on multiple threads. If the list of values is finite and known in advance, the flyweights can be instantiated ahead of time and retrieved from a container on multiple threads with no contention. If flyweights are instantiated on multiple threads, there are two options:

# Make flyweight instantiation single-threaded, thus introducing contention and ensuring one instance per value.
# Allow concurrent threads to create multiple flyweight instances, thus eliminating contention and allowing multiple instances per value.

To enable safe sharing between clients and threads, flyweight objects can be made into immutable value objects, where two instances are considered equal if their values are equal.

== Examples ==

=== C# ===
In this example, every instance of the codice_19 class uses a codice_20 class to provide data.

// Defines Flyweight object that repeats itself.
public class Flyweight
 public string Name { get; set; }
 public string Location { get; set; }
 public string Website { get; set; }
 public byte[] Logo { get; set; }

public static class Pointer
 public static readonly Flyweight Company = new Flyweight { &quot;Abc&quot;,&quot;XYZ&quot;,&quot;www.example.com&quot; };

public class MyObject
 public string Name { get; set; }
 public string Company =&gt; Pointer.Company.Name;


=== C++ ===
The C++ Standard Template Library provides several containers that allow unique objects to be mapped to a key. The use of containers helps further reduce memory usage by removing the need for temporary objects to be created.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

// Instances of Tenant will be the Flyweights
class Tenant {
public:
 Tenant(const std::string&amp; name = &quot;&quot;) : m_name(name) {}

 std::string name() const {
 return m_name;
private:
 std::string m_name;

// Registry acts as a factory and cache for Tenant flyweight objects
class Registry {
public:
 Registry() : tenants() {}

 Tenant&amp; findByName(const std::string&amp; name) {
 if (!tenants.contains(name)) {
 tenants[name] = Tenant{name};
 return tenants[name];
private:
 std::map&lt;std::string, Tenant&gt; tenants;

// Apartment maps a unique tenant to their room number.
class Apartment {
public:
 Apartment() : m_occupants(), m_registry() {}

 void addOccupant(const std::string&amp; name, int room) {
 m_occupants[room] = &amp;m_registry.findByName(name);

 void tenants() {
 for (const auto &amp;i : m_occupants) {
 const int&amp; room = i.first;
 const auto&amp; tenant = i.second;
 std::cout « tenant-&gt;name() « &quot; occupies room &quot; « room « std::endl;
 }
private:
 std::map&lt;int, Tenant*&gt; m_occupants;
 Registry m_registry;

int main() {
 Apartment apartment;
 apartment.addOccupant(&quot;David&quot;, 1);
 apartment.addOccupant(&quot;Sarah&quot;, 3);
 apartment.addOccupant(&quot;George&quot;, 2);
 apartment.addOccupant(&quot;Sarah&quot;, 12);
 apartment.addOccupant(&quot;Michael&quot;, 10);
 apartment.tenants();

 return 0;

<text>A number of corporations are used by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. They publish literature and perform other operational and administrative functions, representing the interests of the religious organization. &quot;The Society&quot; has been used as a collective term for these corporations.

The oldest and most prominent of their corporation names, &quot;Watch Tower Society&quot;, has also been used synonymously with the religious organization of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, even in their own literature. Particularly since 2000, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have maintained a distinction between their corporations and their religious organization. The primary corporations are operated by Governing Body &quot;helpers&quot; who implement its decisions.

==Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania==
&quot;Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&quot; is a non-stock, not-for-profit organization headquartered in Warwick, New York, United States. It is the main legal entity used worldwide by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, often referred to as &quot;The Society&quot;. It holds the copyrights of most literature published by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The society was founded in 1881 with William Henry Conley, a Pittsburgh businessman, as the first president and Charles Taze Russell as secretary-treasurer. The society was incorporated as &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower Tract Society&quot; in Pennsylvania on December 15, 1884, with Russell as president. The corporation was officially renamed &quot;Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society&quot; in 1896; similar names had been in unofficial use since at least 1892.

===Board of Directors===
* President: Robert Louis Ciranko
* Vice-Presidents: Richard E. Devine, David W. Schafer
* Secretary-Treasurer: Danny L. Bland
* Other Directors: Enrique R. Ford, Robert V. Luccioni, Mark J. Noumair

===Name changes===
* &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower Tract Society&quot; (1881–1896)
* &quot;Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society&quot; (1896–1955)
* &quot;Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&quot; (since 1955)

== United States corporations ==

=== Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. ===

&quot;Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.&quot; is a corporation used by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses which is responsible for administrative matters, such as real estate, especially within the United States. This corporation is typically cited as the publisher of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses publications, though other publishers are sometimes cited. The corporation&#x27;s stated purposes are: “Charitable, benevolent, scientific, historical, literary and religious purposes; the moral and mental improvement of men and women, the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and for religious missionary work.” In 2001, &quot;Newsday&quot; listed the Watch Tower Society as one of New York&#x27;s forty richest corporations, with revenues exceeding $950 million.

Originally known as the &quot;Peoples Pulpit Association&quot;, the organization was incorporated in 1909 when the Society&#x27;s principal offices moved to Brooklyn, New York. In 1939, it was renamed &quot;Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc.&quot;, and in 1956, the name was changed to &quot;Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc&quot;. Until 2000, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses was president of both the &quot;Watch Tower&quot; (Pennsylvania) and &quot;Watchtower&quot; (New York) corporations, as well as Britain&#x27;s International Bible Students Association corporation; in 2001, it was decided that the corporations&#x27; directors need not be members of the Governing Body.

====Board of Directors====
* President: Harold L. Corken
* Vice-Presidents: Anthony Griffin, John D. Larson
* Secretary-Treasurer: Mark L. Questell
* Assistant Secretary-Treasurers: Kent E. Fischer, Edgar Rene Llerena, Jesse V. Morris

===Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Inc.===

&quot;Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Inc.&quot; was established to organize and administer the congregational affairs of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the United States. It filed for incorporation on August 21, 2000, in New York State as a “domestic non-profit corporation” in Putnam County, New York. An incorporation record was also filed with the State of Florida on March 3, 2006, as a &quot;foreign non-profit corporation&quot; with an agency in Collier County, Florida.

As announced to congregations in January 2001, the Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is a corporation used by their United States branch committee, which oversees the preaching work of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the United States, Bermuda, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. All branch committee members are appointed by and report to the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

As with other agencies of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses may correspond directly with any circuit overseer, local body of elders, or individual, or it may assign someone else to communicate on its behalf. Any of these persons or groups may function as an agency acting at the explicit direction of the Governing Body.

====Board of Directors====
* President: Allen E. Shuster
* Vice-Presidents: Gary Breaux, Andrew Sciascia
* Secretary-Treasurer: Mark Turner
* Assistant Secretary-Treasurers: Keith Wolff, Richard L. Ashe, Jr., Thomas Jefferson, Jr.

===Other US corporations===
Reorganization in 2000 resulted in the creation of several additional corporate entities to serve the needs of the United States branch of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Since then, most written communication with congregations and individuals in the United States involves the Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Inc.; other corporations include:
* &quot;Religious Order of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, New York&quot;, incorporated in 2000 for the administration of full-time preaching activities.
* &quot;Kingdom Support Services, Inc., New York&quot;, incorporated in 2000 for construction and fleet management.

==Corporations outside the United States==

===International Bible Students Association===
The &quot;International Bible Students Association&quot; (IBSA) is a corporate not-for-profit organization used by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the United Kingdom for the production and distribution of religious literature. Its stated purpose is &quot;to promote the Christian religion by supporting congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and others in connection with their spiritual and material welfare in Britain and abroad within the charitable purposes of the Association.&quot;

The IBSA was founded in 1914 as a corporation of the Bible Students by Charles Taze Russell in London, England, and was the first legal corporation representing Russell&#x27;s ministry in Europe. The Watch Tower Society stated in 1917 that the IBSA, along with its Pennsylvania and New York based corporations &quot;were organized for identical purposes and they harmoniously work together.&quot; Other similarly named corporations operate in various countries to promote the interests of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

===Other corporations===
Since the formation of the International Bible Students Association, many other corporations sanctioned by the Governing Body have been used throughout the world to further the interests of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses by supporting the activities of their respective branch offices in different countries, for example:
* &quot;Associação Torre de Vigia de Bíblias e Tratados&quot; (Brazil)
* &quot;Association culturelle des Témoins de Jéhovah de France &quot;
* &quot;Association of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses of East Africa&quot;
* &quot;Los Testigos de Jehová en México&quot;
* &quot;Wachtturm Bibel- und Traktat-Gesellschaft der Zeugen Jehovas e. V., Selters/Taunus&quot; (Germany)
* &quot;Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society Of Australia, Inc.&quot;

In some countries, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses use the corporation name &quot;Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot; or a similar name translated into the local language. In 2005, the branch office in Canada began using this name as a separate Canadian entity for most correspondence, while retaining &quot;Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Canada&quot; for other matters. In Mexico, the corporation, &quot;Congregación Cristiana de los Testigos de Jehová&quot;, is used. Literature of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses has also referred to the denomination generally as the &quot;Christian congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;.

<doc id="140542" wikidata="Q1418619" url="?curid=140542" title="Memento pattern">
<text>The memento pattern is a software design pattern that exposes the private internal state of an object.
One example of how this can be used is to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback), another is versioning, another is custom serialization.

The memento pattern is implemented with three objects: the &quot;originator&quot;, a &quot;caretaker&quot; and a &quot;memento&quot;. The originator is some object that has an internal state. The caretaker is going to do something to the originator, but wants to be able to undo the change. The caretaker first asks the originator for a memento object. Then it does whatever operation (or sequence of operations) it was going to do. To roll back to the state before the operations, it returns the memento object to the originator. The memento object itself is an opaque object (one which the caretaker cannot, or should not, change). When using this pattern, care should be taken if the originator may change other objects or resources—the memento pattern operates on a single object.

Classic examples of the memento pattern include a pseudorandom number generator (each consumer of the PRNG serves as a caretaker who can initialize the PRNG (the originator) with the same seed (the memento) to produce an identical sequence of pseudorandom numbers) and the state in a finite state machine.

== Structure ==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===

In the above UML class diagram, 
the codice_1 class refers to the codice_2 class 
for saving (codice_3) and restoring (codice_4) originator&#x27;s internal state.
&lt;br&gt;
The codice_2 class implements 
&lt;br&gt;
(1) codice_3 by creating and returning a codice_7 object that stores originator&#x27;s current internal state
and 
&lt;br&gt;
(2) codice_4 by restoring state from the passed in codice_7 object.
&lt;br&gt;

The UML sequence diagram
shows the run-time interactions: 
&lt;br&gt;
(1) Saving originator&#x27;s internal state: The codice_1 object calls codice_3 on the codice_2 object,
which creates a codice_7 object, saves 
its current internal state (codice_14), and returns the codice_7 to the codice_1.
&lt;br&gt;
(2) Restoring originator&#x27;s internal state: The codice_1 calls codice_4 on the codice_2 object and specifies the codice_7 object that stores the state that should be restored. The codice_2 gets the state (codice_22) from the codice_7 to set its own state.

== Java example ==


The following Java program illustrates the &quot;undo&quot; usage of the memento pattern.
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
class Originator {
 private String state;
 // The class could also contain additional data that is not part of the
 // state saved in the memento..
 public void set(String state) {
 this.state = state;
 System.out.println(&quot;Originator: Setting state to &quot; + state);
 
 public Memento saveToMemento() {
 System.out.println(&quot;Originator: Saving to Memento.&quot;);
 return new Memento(this.state);
 
 public void restoreFromMemento(Memento memento) {
 this.state = memento.getSavedState();
 System.out.println(&quot;Originator: State after restoring from Memento: &quot; + state);
 
 public static class Memento {
 private final String state;

 public Memento(String stateToSave) {
 state = stateToSave;
 
 // accessible by outer class only
 private String getSavedState() {
 return state;
 }
 
class Caretaker {

}
The output is:
 Originator: Setting state to State1
 Originator: Setting state to State2
 Originator: Saving to Memento.
 Originator: Setting state to State3
 Originator: Saving to Memento.
 Originator: Setting state to State4
 Originator: State after restoring from Memento: State3
This example uses a String as the state, which is an immutable object in Java. In real-life scenarios the state will
almost always be a mutable object, in which case a copy of the state must be made.

It must be said that the implementation shown has a drawback: it declares an internal class. It would be better if this memento strategy could apply to more than one originator.

There are mainly three other ways to achieve Memento:
# Serialization.
# A class declared in the same package.
# The object can also be accessed via a proxy, which can achieve any save/restore operation on the object.

== C# example ==
The memento pattern allows one to capture the internal state of an object without violating encapsulation such that later one can undo/revert the changes if required. Here one can see that the &quot;memento object&quot; is actually used to &quot;revert&quot; the changes made in the object.

class Memento
 private readonly string savedState;

 private Memento(string stateToSave)
 savedState = stateToSave;

 public class Originator
 private string state;
 // The class could also contain additional data that is not part of the
 // state saved in the memento.

 public void Set(string state)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Originator: Setting state to &quot; + state);
 this.state = state;

 public Memento SaveToMemento()
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Originator: Saving to Memento.&quot;);
 return new Memento(state);

 public void RestoreFromMemento(Memento memento)
 state = memento.savedState;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Originator: State after restoring from Memento: &quot; + state);
 }

class Caretaker
 static void Main(string[] args)
 var savedStates = new List&lt;Memento&gt;();

 var originator = new Memento.Originator();
 originator.Set(&quot;State1&quot;);
 originator.Set(&quot;State2&quot;);
 savedStates.Add(originator.SaveToMemento());
 originator.Set(&quot;State3&quot;);
 // We can request multiple mementos, and choose which one to roll back to.
 savedStates.Add(originator.SaveToMemento());
 originator.Set(&quot;State4&quot;);

<doc id="140546" wikidata="Q333772" url="?curid=140546" title="Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax">
<text>Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax (16 April 1661 – 19 May 1715) was an English statesman and poet. He was the grandson of the 1st Earl of Manchester and was eventually ennobled himself, first as Baron Halifax in 1700 and later as Earl of Halifax in 1714. As one of the four members of the so-called Whig Junto, Montagu played a major role in English politics under the reigns of King William III and Queen Anne. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1694 to 1699 and as First Lord of the Treasury from 1714 until his death the following year. He was also president of the Royal Society and a patron of the scientist Isaac Newton.

==Early life==
Charles Montagu was born in Horton, Northamptonshire, to Elizabeth Irby and George Montagu, fifth son of the 1st Earl of Manchester. He was educated first in the country, and then at Westminster School, where he was chosen as a Queen&#x27;s Scholar in 1677, and entered into close friendship with George Stepney.

In 1679 Montagu was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge. At the time his relation, Dr. John Montagu, was Master of Trinity College and took him under his wing. While studying at Cambridge Montagu began a lasting association with Isaac Newton.
He graduated with an MA in 1682 and became a Fellow of Trinity in 1683.

Two portraits of Montagu by Godfrey Kneller are in the college collection.

In 1685, Montagu&#x27;s verses on the death of King Charles II made such an impression on the Earl of Dorset that he was invited to town and introduced to other entertainments. In 1687, Montagu joined with Matthew Prior in &quot;The City Mouse and the Country Mouse&quot;, a burlesque of John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Hind and the Panther&quot;. Shortly before the Glorious Revolution, he married his cousin&#x27;s widow, the Dowager Countess of Manchester. In the 1689 election, with the support of the Earl of Dorset and the Lord Lieutenant of Essex, the Earl of Oxford, he successfully contested the Maldon constituency against the Tory Sir John Bramston. Montagu sat for Maldon in the Convention Parliament of 1689. He also purchased for £1,500 a position as Clerk of the Council, to which he was appointed on 21 February 1689. He was returned for Maldon again without a contest at the 1690 election.

==Political office==
In 1691, having become a member of the House of Commons, he argued in favour of a law to grant the assistance of counsel in trials for high treason. He became flustered in the middle of his speech, and upon recovering himself, observed &quot;how reasonable it was to allow counsel to men called as criminals before a court of justice, when it appeared how much the presence of that assembly could disconcert one of their own body&quot;.

After the House of Commons he rose quickly, becoming one of the Commissioners of the Treasury and a member of the Privy Council. In 1694 he became Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reward for devising the establishment of the Bank of England, the plan which had been proposed by William Paterson three years before but not acted upon. After an unsuccessful attempt to supplant the Earl of Sunderland&#x27;s leadership with the Whigs, he was compelled to reconcile with him in August 1695. With the support of Sunderland and the Court, Montagu was returned to Parliament for the Westminster constituency in October 1695. In the same year he was involved in the successful recoinage project. In 1698, having been appointed to the first Commission of the Treasury, he was also one of the regency in the King&#x27;s absence. The next year he was made Auditor of the Exchequer, and the year after was created Baron Halifax, of Halifax in the County of Yorkshire, with remainder to his nephew George Montagu. His impeachment by the Commons failed, when the Articles were dismissed by the House of Lords.

John Macky relates a short description of the circumstances leading up to Charles, Lord Halifax&#x27;s impeachment, in the Secret Service Papers published by his son in 1733.

...But as all courtiers, who rise too quick, as he did, are envied, so his great Favour with the King, and powerful Interest in the House, raised a great Party against him, which he strengthened, by seeming to despise them. The Deficiency of Parliamentary Funds, and the growing Debts of the Nation, by the great Interest of Paper Credit, laid him but too much open to these Attacks, he having the whole Administration of the Revenue. When he saw the Party growing too strong for him in the House of Commons, he prudently got himself made a Lord; and as a Screen from all Objections against his Administration, quitted his Management of Commissioner, to serve as Auditor: But his Enemies did not quit him so, they followed him into the House of Peers with an Impeachment, and so left no Stone unturned, to get him out of his Employ, bespattering him every Day with Pamphlets.
:—&quot;Memoirs of the Secret Services of John Macky Esq.&quot;, pp. 51–54.
On the accession of Queen Anne, Montagu was dismissed from the Council, and in the first Parliament of her reign was again attacked by the Commons, and again escaped by the protection of the Lords. In 1704 he wrote an answer to Bromley&#x27;s speech against occasional conformity. He headed the inquiry into the danger of the Church. In 1706 he proposed and negotiated the Union with Scotland and when the Elector of Hanover received the Garter, after the Act had passed for securing the Protestant Succession, he was appointed to carry the ensigns of the Order to the Electoral Court. He sat as one of the judges of Henry Sacheverell, but voted for a mild sentence. Being now no longer in favour, he obtained a writ for summoning the Electoral Prince to Parliament as Duke of Cambridge.

==Earl of Halifax==

At the Queen&#x27;s death Montagu was again appointed one of the regents. At the accession of George I, he was made Viscount Sunbury and Earl of Halifax, with remainder to heirs male, a Knight of the Garter, and First Lord of the Treasury, with a grant to his nephew of the reversion of the Auditorship of the Exchequer. Shortly afterwards he died of an inflammation of his lungs. The viscountcy and earldom became extinct on his death as he had no sons while he was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his nephew George Montagu.

Halifax is reported to have left Catherine Barton, Newton&#x27;s niece, a sizable inheritance for &quot;her &quot;excellent conversation&quot;, as John Flamsteed wryly reported at the time. Many of his possessions were auctioned by Christopher Cock on 25 March 1740 at his room in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden.

Alexander Pope commemorated the Earl&#x27;s death in his unpublished poem &quot;Farewell to London in the Year 1715&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;The love of arts lies cold and dead
In Halifax&#x27;s urn,
And not one Muse of all he fed
Has yet the grace to mourn.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="140547" wikidata="Q468612" url="?curid=140547" title="Geoff Emerick">
<text>Geoffrey Ernest Emerick (5 December 1945 – 2 October 2018) was an English sound engineer and record producer who worked with the Beatles on their albums &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966), &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969). Beatles producer George Martin credited him with bringing &quot;a new kind of mind to the recordings, always suggesting sonic ideas, different kinds of reverb, what we could do with the voices&quot;.

Emerick also engineered the Zombies&#x27; &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; (1968), Paul McCartney and Wings&#x27; &quot;Band on the Run&quot; (1973) and produced Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982), among many others. He won four Grammy Awards for his work in the music recording field. His 2006 memoir &quot;Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles&quot; caused controversy for its factual errors. In 2018, Emerick died from a heart attack at the age of 72 in Los Angeles, California.

==Early career at EMI==
Geoff Emerick was brought up in Crouch End in north London and educated at Crouch End secondary modern school. One of his teachers there heard about a job at EMI and suggested he apply. At age 16, he was employed as an assistant engineer. On 4 September 1962, his second day at work, the Beatles came to EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) to carry out their second recording session for the company. To familiarise Emerick with his work, he was placed under the supervision of another assistant engineer, Richard Langham, assistant to recording engineer Norman Smith, who would be working on the session. As a new recruit, Emerick was not entitled to receive overtime pay, but he was fortunate enough to witness the Beatles recording for the first time with their new drummer, Ringo Starr, on what became the band&#x27;s debut hit single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;.

==Working with the Beatles and others==
Emerick worked as an assistant engineer to Smith on several of the Beatles&#x27; early recordings, including &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. From early in 1964, his involvement with the band was limited due to his training program at EMI, as he progressed to lacquer cutter, mastering engineer and then balance (or recording) engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Womack/Encyclopedia p 256&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, he helped record other artists for the label, including Judy Garland, and assisted at the EMI artist test of the Hollies. After working his way up to the recording engineer&#x27;s position, Emerick engineered the 1966 Manfred Mann single &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot;, which became a number 1 hit in the UK.

In April 1966 at the age of 20, Emerick took over as the Beatles&#x27; recording engineer, at the request of producer George Martin, when Smith became a producer. Emerick&#x27;s first album in this new role was &quot;Revolver&quot;, starting with the sessions for the song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. It was Emerick&#x27;s suggestion to record John Lennon&#x27;s vocal through a Leslie speaker on the song, to capture the ethereal sound Lennon wanted, and to close-mic Starr&#x27;s drums, formerly a prohibited practice at EMI Studios. In 1967, Emerick engineered &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, one of the most musically complex songs on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Lennon told Martin he wanted to re-create the &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot; of the Pablo Fanque circus poster that inspired the song. For the middle eight bars, Emerick spliced together multiple recordings of fairground organs and calliope in an attempt to create the effect; after a great deal of unsuccessful experimentation, Martin instructed Emerick to chop the tape into pieces with scissors, throw them up in the air, and re-assemble them at random. Later in 1967, he engineered the Zombies&#x27; &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; and Tomorrow&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

Emerick abandoned work on &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) on 16 July 1968, and quit his position after McCartney, working for a frustrating three days trying to record &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, unleashed an angry swear word filled tirade. Emerick also objected to Chris Thomas, Martin&#x27;s inexperienced assistant, being elevated to the role of producer in Martin&#x27;s absence, with the band&#x27;s acceptance. He returned to work with the Beatles on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Emerick received Grammy Awards for the engineering of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

Despite his departure from the White Album sessions, Emerick remained on good terms with the Beatles, particularly Paul McCartney, who invited Emerick to quit EMI and come and work for their company Apple Corps in 1969. In addition to engineering duties, Emerick oversaw the building of the band&#x27;s Apple Studio in the Apple Corps building.

==After the Beatles==
Following the Beatles&#x27; break-up in 1970, Emerick continued to work with McCartney. He served as recording engineer on McCartney albums such as &quot;Band on the Run&quot; (1973), which netted Emerick another Grammy, &quot;London Town&quot; (1978), &quot;Tug of War&quot; (1982) and &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; (1997). Emerick later said that he had always been perceived by the other ex-Beatles as &quot;Paul&#x27;s guy&quot;. As a result, for their solo recordings, Lennon and George Harrison chose to work instead with Phil McDonald, another former EMI engineer.

Emerick was the sound engineer on Robin Trower&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; and was credited by both Trower and producer Matthew Fisher for that album&#x27;s sound. He also recorded some of the backing tracks for the debut album by Stealers Wheel, but resigned early on in the process, handing over to Apple recording engineer John Mills to continue working with producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The Stealers Wheel album featured &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; and went on to receive the Dutch Edison Award.

Following the success of EMI&#x27;s &quot;The Beatles at Abbey Road&quot; presentation in 1983, Emerick prepared an album of the Beatles&#x27; studio outtakes, to be titled &quot;Sessions&quot;, for release. The former Beatles initiated legal proceedings to prevent EMI from issuing the album, saying that the work was substandard; when made available on bootleg compilations, his mixes and editing of some of the tracks were widely criticised by collectors. In the mid-1990s, these recordings were used for the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; CD releases.

Emerick also worked on albums by Elvis Costello (for whom he produced &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; and &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot;), Badfinger, Art Garfunkel, America, Jeff Beck, Gino Vannelli, Supertramp, UFO, Cheap Trick, Nazareth, Chris Bell, Split Enz, Trevor Rabin, Nick Heyward, Big Country, Gentle Giant, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Ultravox. His other recording projects included Matthew Fisher&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;; Kate Bush&#x27;s demo tape to EMI, which landed her a record deal; and Nellie McKay&#x27;s critically acclaimed 2004 debut CD &quot;Get Away from Me&quot;. In 2003, he received his fourth Grammy, a Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award.

In 2007, Emerick produced a re-recording of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in honour of the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary. It included performances by contemporary artists such as Oasis, the Killers, Travis and Razorlight. Emerick used much of the original equipment to record the new versions of the songs, and the results were broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 2 June that year.

From 1984, Emerick resided in Los Angeles.

==&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;==
In 2006, Emerick released his memoir, &quot;Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles&quot;, co-authored by music journalist Howard Massey. The book caused controversy for its factual errors, its allegedly unfavourable portrayal of Harrison, bias towards McCartney, and belittling and dismissal of Harrison and Starr&#x27;s contributions. According to Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez, Emerick&#x27;s recurring theme that Harrison lacked prowess as a guitar player until the late 1960s is more reflective of Emerick&#x27;s personality, and is countered by several other sources, and some of his descriptions of the Beatles&#x27; recordings are negated by the availability of bootleg compilations of the band&#x27;s multitrack masters.

Historian Erin Torkelson Weber said that, apart from Lennon&#x27;s account in &quot;Lennon Remembers&quot;, the book also presents arguably the most negative depiction of Martin as a record producer. The publication led to an Internet flame war, as former Beatles engineer Ken Scott challenged the accuracy of Emerick&#x27;s recollections and stated that, before writing the book, Emerick had contacted him and other EMI technical staff saying he had limited memory of the events. Scott&#x27;s 2012 autobiography, &quot;From Abbey Road to Ziggy Stardust&quot;, sought to correct Emerick&#x27;s statements in &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, especially with regard to Harrison&#x27;s musicianship and character.

==Death==
Emerick died from a heart attack on 2 October 2018, aged 72. He had been hospitalised two weeks beforehand after experiencing trouble walking, but was ruled to have been dehydrated. His manager, William Zabaleta, recalled talking to Emerick for the last time: &quot;While on the phone, he had complications and dropped the phone. I called 911, but by the time they got there, it was too late. Geoff suffered from heart problems for a long time and had a pacemaker. When it&#x27;s your time, it&#x27;s your time. We lost a legend and a best friend to me and a mentor.&quot;

Paul McCartney commented on social media: &quot;He was smart, fun-loving, and the genius behind many of the great sounds on our records. I&#x27;m shocked and saddened to have lost such a special friend.&quot;

<text>Naphtali Daggett (September 8, 1727 – November 25, 1780) was an American academic and educator. He graduated from Yale University in 1748. Three years later, he became pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Smithtown, Long Island. In 1755, the Yale Corporation persuaded him to return to New Haven to assist President Thomas Clapp in the pulpit, and to be considered for appointment as a college professor. On March 4, 1756, the Corporation inducted him as Yale&#x27;s first professor—officially the Livingstonian Professor of Divinity.

Daggett became the college&#x27;s president &quot;pro tempore&quot; in 1766 after the resignation of President Clap. Daggett held the office of President for the next eleven years, until 1777.

When the British attacked New Haven in 1779, Rev. Daggett took up arms in defense but was taken prisoner and forced to serve as a guide. He was bayoneted by his captors, and died in 1780.

<text>Lien Chan (; born August 27, 1936) is a Taiwanese political scientist and politician. He was the Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government from 1990 to 1993, Premier of the Republic of China from 1993 to 1997, Vice President of the Republic of China from 1996 to 2000, and was the Chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) from 2000 to 2005, apart from various ministerial posts he had also held. 

After graduating from National Taiwan University, Lien earned a master&#x27;s degree and PhD from the University of Chicago in the United States. He ran for the President of the Republic of China on behalf of the Kuomintang twice in 2000 and 2004, but both lost to Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Upon his retirement as KMT Chairman in August 2005, he was given the title Honorary Chairman of KMT. 

Lien is highly credited after holding a groundbreaking visit to Mainland China in his capacity as the Chairman of the Kuomintang to meet with the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Hu Jintao on April 29, 2005, the first meeting between the two party leaders after the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, which subsequently helped thaw the long-stalled cross-strait relations.

==Early life and education==

Lien Chan was born at Jenkins and Robertson Hospital in Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi province, China as the only child of Taiwanese father Lien Chen-tung and Mainland Chinese mother Chao Lan-k&#x27;un (趙蘭坤). His paternal grandfather, Lien Heng, was the writer of &quot;The General History of Taiwan&quot; (臺灣通史), a book that is often cited for the quote, &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s sorrow is that it has no history.&quot;His father, Lien Chen-tung, served as Minister of the Interior from 1960 to 1966, promoting local autonomy and maintaining close ties with the CC Clique. His mother, Zhao Lankun, came from a prominent family in Shenyang and had Manchu ancestry. She graduated from Yenching University.

Lien earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the National Taiwan University in 1957 and then pursued graduate studies in the United States, where he earned a Master of Arts (1961) in international law and diplomacy and a Ph.D. (1965) from the University of Chicago. He married former Miss Republic of China Fang Yu the same year he received his doctorate. Lien is also currently a Trustee Emeritus on the Board of Trustees to the University of Chicago.

Lien held assistant professorships of political science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1966 to 1967 and the University of Connecticut from 1967 to 1968. He returned to Taiwan in 1968 to become visiting professor of political science at the National Taiwan University, serving as chairman of the Political Science Department and dean of the Graduate Institute of Political Science the following year.

His official positions included Ambassador to El Salvador (1975–1976), Minister of Transportation and Communications (1981–1987), Vice Premier (1987–1988), Foreign Minister (1988–1990) before becoming Governor of Taiwan Province (1990–1993). In 1993 he was appointed Premier of the Republic of China. In 1996, Lee Teng-hui selected him as running mate in the presidential election. Lee and Lien won the election for the presidency and the vice-presidency respectively. Before becoming Chairman of the KMT, he was Vice Chairman (1993–2000) and a member of the Central Committee (1984–2000).

During his term in office, Lien was credited for having established National Health Insurance, which is the national health insurance policy for all citizens of the Republic of China. It ranks as one of the best national health plans in the world and modeled by other nations who seek to have a national health coverage for other citizens. He spearheaded the constructions of Cross-Island Highway (橫貫公路), a series of highways that connected the eastern side of the island to the western side of the island. Taiwan is dominated by the Central Mountain Range which cordons off the east from the west. In order to go to the eastern side from the western side, one had to circle the island to reach their destinations before the highways were constructed. After Lien constructed these highways, traffic back-and-forth between the east and west of the island was much more efficient. He also began the reconstruction to the Military dependents’ villages (眷村) which were temporary shelters designated for the military personnel and their families when the Kuomintang (KMT) first moved to Taiwan. There are over 879 of these Military dependents’ villages which housing nearly 100,000 households within. Most of this housing was temporary shelter and were constructed during the period between 1945 and 1950s to house the military personnel as the KMT retreated to Taiwan. Half a century later when it became clear that reunification with Mainland China under the terms of the Republic of China would not be possible, it became obvious that the housing for the military personnel would have to be reconstructed.

Throughout Lien&#x27;s term as Foreign Minister and through his premiership, about 30 countries had diplomatic relations with Republic of China (Taiwan), this was the highest number of diplomatic relations since Republic of China was expelled from the United Nations in 1972 and severed diplomatic relations with the United States in 1976. Lien also established diplomatic relations with Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Grenada, Belize, Republic of Guinea-Bissau and reestablished diplomatic relations with Kingdom of Lesotho, Republic of Liberia and the Republic of Nicaragua.

Lien also established the foundations for the Internet in Taiwan via research centers established under the National Science Council (國家科學委員會). Furthermore, he liberalized the telecommunications network which allowed for multiple players to compete and ushered in the mobile service era in the Telecommunications sector. He also revised and deregulated the regulation on cable television sector that allowed for multiple players in the television and cable sectors. These policies made Taiwan the most liberal area in Asia for Media.

For the purpose of developing Taiwan as an economic hub in the Asia-Pacific, Lien espoused a platform called the “Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Center” because Taiwan has two natural deep water harbors, one is Keelung and second one is Kaohsiung, shipments from all over the world would transport and transfer in these harbors before heading to Japan, Korea, China or Southeast Asia. However, due to Lee Teng-hui&#x27;s (李登輝) “two state solution” (兩國論), a theory advocated for China and Taiwan to engage in a special &quot;state to state relationship&quot;, Mainland China was deeply angered, therefore Taiwan became increasingly marginalized.

Lien took an active role as a representative of Lee Teng-hui in quasi-official diplomacy in the mid-1990s. One of the greatest moments of his career is his 1995 meeting with Václav Havel, in which Lien likened the democratic reforms of the Lee Teng-hui administration as being similar to the Velvet Revolution.

After the defeat of the KMT in 2000, Lien assume the leadership of the KMT. As the Chairman of the KMT, Lien vowed to learn from his loss and remake the KMT party. He held forums to discuss erasing the KMT&#x27;s image as a corrupt institution and Lien promised to give up property seized by the KMT after the Japanese exodus.

The Pan-Blue reunited in the election of 2004 with Lien and Soong running on a combined ticket against DPP&#x27;s Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu. Chen Shui-bian was the incumbent and was trailing 13% behind in the polls before ballot day. Then, out of nowhere came two bullets, one barely grazing Chen&#x27;s belly and another one grazing Annette Lu&#x27;s knee. Immediately the DPP-control government suspended all election activities and prohibited all servicemen, policeman and security workers to return home to vote. The servicemen are typically Pan-Blue voters and number of service men affected was roughly 350,000. The DPP Secretary General of the President&#x27;s office Chiou I-jen (邱義仁) immediately came out on media to announce that there was an assassination attempt on the DPP candidates Chen and Lu and accused the KMT of collaborating with the Chinese Communists Party to assassinate Taiwan&#x27;s President. Lien lost that election by 0.228% margin, a mere 29,518 votes out of a total of 12,914,422 (12 million nine hundred and fourteen thousand four hundred and twenty two) ballots cast. Both Chen and Lu were released from the hospital on the same day and went to vote on the next day. Neither one had life-threatening injury nor did they lose consciousness or had a surgery. Rather, alleged assassin Chen Yi-hsiung (陳義雄) was killed and his body was found ten days later ditched into a pond near where he lives. His body was formally dressed in suite and tie and entangled in a fishnet.

This incident sparked mass riots and controversy because it was believed that the shooting was staged in order to gain sympathy votes for Chen and Lu who won by a sliver of a margin. Hence the 319 Shooting Truth Investigation Special Committee was established.

On January 31, 2008, the 319 Shooting Truth Investigation Special Committee concluded its investigation into the assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) and Vice President Annette Lu (呂秀蓮), and raised questions about whether the shooting was a staged event. &quot;We have compared all of the evidence and clues through interviews and reconstructed the scene. Although the truth of the event remains unclear, the &quot;truth&quot; that government publicized and the evidence don&#x27;t match,&quot; committee convener Wang Ching-feng (王清峰) told reporters. The report also suggested that Chen Yi-hsiung (陳義雄), whom the authorities identified as the shooter, was murdered instead of committing suicide when he was found dead 10 days after the incident.

In 2005, after Ma was elected as KMT chairman to succeed Lien, the KMT Central Committee offered the title of &quot;Chairman Emeritus&quot; (Honorary Chairman) to Lien.

In December 2010, Lien was awarded the Confucius Peace Prize in China, which was instituted as a reaction to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu Xiaobo. Lien&#x27;s office said to the &quot;Taipei Times&quot;: “We&#x27;ve never heard of such an award and of course Mr Lien has no plans to accept it.”

<text>The al-Hakim Mosque (), also known as al-Anwar (), is a historic mosque in Cairo, Egypt. It is named after al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh (985–1021), the 6th Fatimid caliph and 16th Ismāʿīlī Imam. Construction of the mosque was originally started by Caliph al-ʿAziz, the son of al-Muʿizz and the father of al-Ḥākim, in 990 CE. It was completed in 1013 by al-Ḥākim, which is why it is named after him.

The mosque is located in Islamic Cairo, on the east side of al-Muʿizz Street, just south of Bab al-Futuh (the northern city gate). In the centuries since its construction, the mosque was often neglected and re-purposed for other functions, eventually falling into ruin. In 1980, a major restoration and reconstruction of the mosque was completed by the Dawoodi Bohras, resulting in its reopening for religious use.

== History ==

=== Fatimid construction and modifications ===
The mosque&#x27;s construction was initiated by the 5th Fatimid caliph al-ʿAziz Billah in the year 990 CE and the first Friday prayers took place in it a year later, though the building was incomplete. This suggests that the prayer hall or sanctuary, the area where prayers were led, was probably built first. His successor, al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh, and his overseer Abu Muhammad al-Hafiz &#x27;Abd al-Ghani ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Misri, resumed construction work in 1002–1003. In 1010, the minarets were modified by the construction of large square bastions around them, which hid much of the original towers. The chronology of construction in the mosque&#x27;s interior and the determination of exactly which part was built by which patron, is uncertain.

Finally, its inauguration took place in Ramadan of the year 1013. It measured 120 meters by 113 meters when it was finished and was more than double the size of the al-Azhar Mosque. Al-Hakim allocated 40,000 dinars to the construction and then another 5,000 dinars to its furnishings. The al-Hakim Mosque was also known by an epithet, &quot;al-Anwar&quot; (&#x27;the Illuminated&#x27;), similar in style to the name of the earlier al-Azhar Mosque founded by the Fatimids. At the time of inauguration, al-Hakim permitted a celebratory procession which made its way from al-Azhar to al-Anwar and from al-Anwar back to al-Azhar.

The mosque originally stood outside the walls of Cairo, but when the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali rebuilt and extended the city walls in 1087, the northern side of the mosque, including its minaret, was incorporated into the northern city wall (between the newly-built gates of Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr). A &quot;ziyada&quot;, or a walled outer enclosure, was also added around the mosque later, begun by Caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021&quot;–&quot;1036) but completed much later under the Ayyubid sultan al-Salih Najm al-Din (r. 1240–1249) and the Mamluk sultan Aybak (r. 1250–1257). 

=== Post-Fatimid era ===

In 1303, during the Mamluk period, the mosque was severely damaged by an earthquake and was subsequently restored by Sultan Baybars II al-Jashankir. By that time, the mosque was also being used to teach Islamic law from the four Sunni &quot;maddhabs&quot;. In 1360, the mosque was restored again by Sultan Hasan. In the 15th century, a merchant sponsored the construction of a third minaret for the mosque, though this minaret has not been preserved.

The interior of the mosque fell into ruin over many centuries until its modern renovation, and the building was only intermittently used as a mosque. At various times, it was used as a prison for captured Franks (i.e. Latin crusaders) during the Crusades, as a stable by Saladin, as a fortress by Napoleon, as an Islamic arts Museum in 1890, and as a boys&#x27; school in the 20th century during Nasser&#x27;s presidency. In the early 19th century, the mosque underwent a restoration sponsored by &#x27;Umar Makram. The restoration also added a small mihrab to the interior that is still preserved today, dated to 1808.

=== 20th century restoration ===

In 1980, the mosque was extensively reconstructed and refurbished in white marble and gold trim by Mohammed Burhanuddin, the head of the Dawoodi Bohra, an international Shia sect based in India. The restoration took 27 months and the mosque was officially re-opened on 24 November 1980, in a ceremony attended by Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, Mohammed Burhanuddin, and other high-ranking Egyptian officials. 

Remnants of the original decorations, including stucco carvings, timber tie-beams, and Quranic inscriptions were preserved, but most of the mosque&#x27;s present interior dates from this reconstruction. Among other things, the restoration introduced a new marble mihrab whose motifs imitated the appearance of the Fatimid-era stucco mihrab in the al-Azhar Mosque. It also involved the demolition of the Mamluk-era tomb of Qurqumas, which stood right in front of the mosque and which was subsequently relocated to the Northern Cemetery. 

The use of &quot;unauthentic&quot; materials and additions during the restoration has been criticized by scholars and conservationists, particularly when judged by the standards of the Venice Charter. The issue has elicited scholarly debate about the relative merits of different philosophies on the restoration and reconstruction of historic sites. Some scholars, like James Roy King and Bernard O&#x27;Kane, have noted that the restoration has at least had the benefit of converting the building from a ruin to a functioning mosque that can be visited by anyone, even if some of the details of the restoration remain problematic. 

===21st century===
In 2017, a new restoration project began, undertaken through a partnership between the Dawoodi Bohra community and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The project encompassed various tasks such as addressing water damage, strengthening wooden structures, refurbishing chandeliers, installing security cameras, and updating electrical wiring. Efforts were made to restore the mosque&#x27;s facades, marble floors, and interior inscriptions. The mosque was reopened after restorations in February 2023.

On June 25, 2023, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi visited the mosque along with Prime Minister of Egypt, Mostafa Madbouly and son of Mufaddal Saifuddin, Husain Burhanuddin.

== Architecture ==

=== General layout ===

The facades and minarets of the mosque are made from stone, while the rest of the structure is made of brick. The mosque&#x27;s rectangular layout consists of an open courtyard surrounded by arcades (&quot;riwaq&quot;s) on four sides. Behind these arcades are roofed areas divided into aisles by more arcades that run parallel to the sides of the courtyard. The space on the northwest side of the courtyard (the entrance side) is two aisles deep, the spaces along its southwest and northeast sides are three aisles deep, and the main prayer hall on the southeast side is five aisles deep. This layout is similar to the layout of the older Ibn Tulun Mosque and the al-Azhar Mosque. A special aisle, running perpendicular to the others, cuts across the five aisles of the prayer hall and leads towards the &quot;mihrab&quot; (niche indicating the &quot;qibla&quot; or direction of prayer). This central aisle is further emphasized by its greater width and height, as well as by the presence of a dome, carried on squinches, that covers the space directly in front of the mihrab. In addition to the main mihrab (which dates entirely from the 1980 restoration), another smaller mihrab to the right, covered in polychrome marble, was added by &#x27;Umar Makram in 1808. 

An unusual feature of the mosque is the monumental main entrance (on the western side) with its projecting stone portal, similar to the older Fatimid-built Great Mosque of Mahdia in present-day Tunisia and most likely similar to the original entrance (no longer extant) of al-Azhar Mosque. The decoration and high-quality stonework of the portal, however, was quite different from that of other Fatimid mosques of this period. Scholar Doris Behrens-Abouseif suggests that this may be due to the employ of foreign craftsmen, perhaps from Syria. The mosque&#x27;s original Fatimid portal has not been preserved; the current portal was reconstructed during the mosque&#x27;s modern restoration according to earlier descriptions provided by K. A. C. Creswell.

=== The minarets ===

The most spectacular feature of the mosque is the minarets on either side of the facade. The northern minaret is 33.7 meters high while the southern minaret is 24.7 meters high. The minarets were originally built in 1003, but the massive bastion towers or salients (referred to as &quot;arkān&quot; in Arabic sources) that define their lower parts today were added in 1010, after their initial construction, for reasons that remain unclear. The two bastions, built of brick, are shaped like two superimposed cubic sections with an austere appearance and little decoration. The center of these bastions is hollow, as they were built around the original towers, whose original lower levels have been preserved inside. The inner towers are braced against the outer towers by supporting arches between them. 

The outer wall of the southern encasing bastion also features an Arabic inscription in foliated Kufic carved in marble, from the Fatimid period. The top edge of this bastion&#x27;s lower section also has ornate crenellations designed in an interlacing motif that resembles the crenellations found at the older Ibn Tulun Mosque. The northern minaret was later incorporated into the city wall by Badr al-Jamali in 1087, at which point the Kufic inscription on its encasing bastion was either moved to or recarved on the outside of the city wall.

The inner (original) minaret towers have a multi-tier design with different forms: the northern minaret has a square base and a cylindrical shaft above it, whereas the southern minaret is composed of a taller square base with an octagonal shaft above it. These sections, now hidden, have extensive carved decoration: the northern tower with horizontal bands with lozenge motifs, whereas the southern tower has decoration similar to the mosque&#x27;s main entrance, including a carved inscription in floriated Kufic that mentions al-Hakim&#x27;s name and the date of construction. The design of these towers was highly original and would have made them distinctive from other minarets that existed in this part of the Islamic world at the time.

The reasons behind al-Hakim&#x27;s decision to encase the original minarets in thick outer walls, while still preserving the original towers inside, have been debated by scholars. Bernard O&#x27;Kane has proposed that the reason for the unusual decision to encase the minarets in these bastions may have been political and symbolic. At the time of construction, the only other mosques that had multiple minarets and had minarets with multi-level designs were the Haram Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina, both located in the Hijaz under Fatimid control at the time. O&#x27;Kane suggests that the minarets of al-Hakim&#x27;s Mosque were designed to reflect and symbolize Fatimid sovereignty over those holy sites at the time. However, by 1010, the ruler of Mecca had rejected Fatimid authority in support of a rebellion in the Palestine region, thus undermining Fatimid claims over those sites. Accordingly, al-Hakim may have ordered the new minarets in Cairo to be hidden in order to obscure this embarrassing political setback. In another analysis, art historian Jennifer Pruitt suggested that the modification to the minarets was due to al-Hakim&#x27;s shifting ideologies and policies in his later reign. Both Pruitt and Jonathan Bloom note that the inscriptions on the original minaret towers (from 1003), which include Qur&#x27;anic verses that feature prominently in the Ismai&#x27;ili &quot;ta&#x27;wīl&quot; of the Qur&#x27;an, differ strongly from the inscriptions on the outer towers (from 1010), which include Qur&#x27;anic verses that are focused on universal justice and on criticizing unbelievers. According to Pruitt, these latter inscriptions are relevant to al-Hakim&#x27;s puritanical policies in his later years as well as his unusual order to destroy the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which happened around the same time in 1009 or 1010. She also notes the austerity of the encasing bastions in contrast with the richly-decorated original towers, as well as their resemblance to other Sunni (i.e. non-Fatimid) minarets of the era. Accordingly, she suggests that al-Hakim&#x27;s decision to obscure the original minarets was part of his complex shift away from traditional Fatimid Isma&#x27;ili doctrines, his re-imagining of himself as a universal ruler and purveyor of justice, and his will to symbolize this in his architectural program. 

The upper parts of the minarets, which extend above the thick square towers that encase their lower sections and are visible today, have octagonal bodies culminating in a &quot;mabkhara&quot;-style head with carved &quot;muqarnas&quot; decoration. They are similar in design but not identical. These tops were rebuilt by the Mamluk sultan Baybars II al-Jashankir after an earthquake in 1303 and reflect an early Mamluk style instead of an original Fatimid style. An Arabic inscription band in Naskhi script on the outer eastern flank of the northern minaret likely dates from the time of Baybars II.
=== Inscriptions ===

One of the artistic elements of the mosque are Quranic inscriptions done in floriated Kufic script – many of the inscriptions are preserved while many are lost. Of those lost, many have been replaced or restored. Due to various restorations made, the Kufic styles have differed from time to time. The mosque is said to have had twelve thousand feet of Kufic adornment. Kufic inscriptions feature on all four sides of each of the five bays of the prayer hall. The square bases of the three domes and the &quot;qibla&quot; wall (southeast wall) underneath the windows also carry the Kufic gypsum band of Quranic inscriptions. At the top, colonnades of the arches of the mosque are embellished with a gypsum band of floriated Kufic inscriptions of the Quran which averages approximately 52 cms in width.

<text>The Legislative Yuan () is the unicameral legislature of the Republic of China (Taiwan) located in Taipei. The Legislative Yuan is composed of 113 members, who are directly elected for four-year terms by people of the Taiwan Area through a parallel voting system.

Originally located in Nanjing, the Legislative Yuan, along with the National Assembly (electoral college) and the Control Yuan (upper house), formed the tricameral parliament under the original 1947 Constitution. The Legislative Yuan previously had 760 members representing each constituencies of all China (includes provinces, municipalities, Tibet Area, and various professions in Mainland China).

Until democratization, the Republic of China was an authoritarian state under the &quot;Dang Guo&quot; system. At the time, the Legislative Yuan functioned as a rubber stamp for the ruling regime of the Kuomintang.

Like parliaments or congresses of other countries, the Legislative Yuan is responsible for the passage of legislation, which is then sent to the president for signing. For these similarities, it is also common for people to refer to the Legislative Yuan as &quot;the parliament&quot; ().

Under the current amended Constitution, the Legislative Yuan, as the only parliamentary body, also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the president (then tried by the Constitutional Court).

==Composition==
===Legislators===

Starting with the 2008 legislative elections, changes were made to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with a constitutional amendment passed in 2005. The Legislative Yuan has 113 members serving four-year terms; 73 members are elected by first-past-the-post, 6 reserved for indigenous candidates by single non-transferable vote, and 34 by party-list proportional representation. The current Legislative Yuan was inaugurated on February 1, 2024, and its term expires on January 31, 2028.

The 5 largest parties with 3 seats or more can form caucuses. If there are fewer than 5 such parties, legislators in other parties or with no party affiliation can form caucuses with at least 4 members.

===Leadership===

The &quot;president&quot; and &quot;vice president&quot; of the Legislative Yuan are elected by the 113 legislators during a preparatory session in the beginning of their 4-year terms. &quot;President&quot; and &quot;vice president&quot; of the Legislative Yuan sometimes translate to &quot;speaker&quot; and &quot;deputy speaker&quot; respectively in English.

The President is responsible for appointing the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, as well as other legislative staff, who are described as the Administrative Unit. The Vice President serves in place during the absence of the President. 

==Functions==
===Powers===
Like legislatures of other countries, the Legislative Yuan holds the following power according to the current amended Constitution:
* make laws and approve national budget, treaties, and emergency decrees issued by the president
* review executive decrees
* interpellation of government officials
* initiate no-confidence votes against the Executive Yuan
* approve appointments to the Examination Yuan, the Control Yuan, the grand justices, the auditor general, the public prosecutor general, the National Communications Commission, the Fair Trade Commission and the Central Election Commission,
* initiate the recall of the president or the vice president, and the impeachment of the president or the vice president
* initiate constitutional amendments, which must be referred to a referendum

Other governmental organs are authorized to propose legislative bills to the Legislative Yuan. Legislative bills proposed to the Legislative Yuan have to be cosigned by a certain number of legislators. Once a bill reaches the legislature, it is subject to a process of three readings.

===Committees===
* Standing committees
** Internal Administration Committee
** Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee
** Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee
** Transportation Committee
** Education and Culture Committee
** Finance Committee
** Economics Committee
** Foreign and National Defense Committee
* Ad hoc committees
** Procedure Committee
** Expenditure Examination Committee
** Constitutional Amendment Committee
** Discipline Committee

==History==
===Constitutional theory===
The concept of Legislative Yuan was introduced by Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot;. The theory proposed a separation of powers into five branches (). The Legislative Yuan, under Sun&#x27;s political theory, is a branch of government elected by the National Assembly that serves as the standing legislative body when the National Assembly is not in session.

The legislators are to be elected through direct elections. In the constitution, Legislative Yuan, together with National Assembly and Control Yuan, form three chambers of a tricameral parliament according to the Judicial Yuan&#x27;s interpretation number 76 of the Constitution (1957).

However, the later constitutional amendments in the 1990s removed the parliamentary roles from National Assembly and Control Yuan and transferred them to the Legislative Yuan, which became an unicameral parliament.

===Establishment and relocation to Taiwan===

The original Legislative Yuan was formed in the original capital of Nanjing after the completion of the Northern Expedition. Its 51 members were appointed to a term of two years. The 4th Legislative Yuan under this period had its members expanded to 194, and its term in office was extended to 14 years because of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). According to KMT political theory, these first four sessions marked the period of political tutelage.

The current Constitution of the Republic of China came into effect on 25 December 1947, and the first Legislative session convened in Nanjing on 18 May 1948, with 760 members. Six preparatory meetings had been held on 8 May 1948, during which Sun Fo and Chen Li-fu were elected president and vice president of the body. In 1949, the mainland fell to the Communist Party and the Legislative Yuan (along with the entire ROC government) was transplanted to Taipei. On 24 February 1950, 380 members convened at the Sun Yat-sen Hall in Taipei.

The first Legislative Yuan was to have been elected for a term of three years ending in 1951; however, the fall of mainland China made it impossible to hold new elections. As a result, the Judicial Yuan decided that the members of the Legislative Yuan would continue to hold office until new elections could be held on the Mainland. This decision was made in the belief that the KMT would retake the Mainland in a short time. However, over the years, as the prospect of regaining the Mainland diminished, this meant that the legislators from mainland districts (and members of the ruling KMT) held their seats for life, in a one-party system. The body thus came to be called &quot;the Non-reelected Congress&quot;.

Over the years, deceased members elected on the mainland were not replaced while additional seats were created for Taiwan starting with eleven seats in 1969. Fifty-one new members were elected to a three-year term in 1972, fifty-two in 1975, ninety-seven in 1980, ninety-eight in 1983, one hundred in 1986, and one hundred thirty in 1989. Although the elected members of the Legislative Yuan did not have the majority to defeat legislation, they were able to use the Legislative Yuan as a platform to express political dissent. Opposition parties were formally illegal until 1991, but in the 1970s candidates to the Legislative Yuan would run as Tangwai (&quot;outside the party&quot;), and in 1985 candidates began to run under the banner of the Democratic Progressive Party.

===Democratization===
The members of the Legislative Yuan with extended terms remained until 31 December 1991, when as part of subsequent Judicial Yuan ruling they were forced to retire and the members elected in 1989 remained until the 161 members of the Second Legislative Yuan were elected in December 1992. The third LY, elected in 1995, had 157 members serving 3-year terms. The fourth LY, elected in 1998, was expanded to 225 members in part to include legislators from the abolished provincial legislature of Taiwan Province. The Legislative Yuan greatly increased its prominence after the 2000 presidential elections in Taiwan when the Executive Yuan and presidency was controlled by the Democratic Progressive Party while the Legislative Yuan had a large majority of Kuomintang members. The legislative elections in late 2001 produced a contentious situation in which the pan-blue coalition has only a thin majority over the governing pan-green coalition in the legislature, making the passage of bills often dependent on the votes of a few defectors and independents. Because of the party situation there have been constitutional conflicts between the Legislative Yuan and the executive branch over the process of appointment for the premier and whether the president has the power to call a special session.

Amid 70% public support, the Legislative Yuan voted 217–1 on 23 August 2004 for a package of amendments to:
* Halve the number of seats from 225 to 113
* Switch to a single-member district parallel voting electoral system
* Increase the terms of members from 3 to 4 years, to synchronize the legislative and presidential elections. (The change was implemented for the next election cycle, as the legislative election was held in January 2008, and the presidential election followed in March.)

The new electoral system installed in 2008 includes 73 plurality seats (one for each electoral district), 6 seats for aboriginals, with the remaining 34 seats to be filled from party lists. Every county has a minimum of 1 electoral district, thereby guaranteed at least one seat in the legislature, while half of the proportionally represented seats drawn from party lists must be women.

Additionally, the Legislative Yuan proposed to abolish the National Assembly. Future amendments would still be proposed by the LY by a three-fourths vote from a quorum of at least three-fourths of all members of the Legislature. After a mandatory 180-day promulgation period, the amendment would have to be ratified by an absolute majority of &quot;all&quot; eligible voters of the ROC &quot;irrespective&quot; of voter turnout. The latter requirement would allow a party to kill a referendum proposal by asking that their voters boycott the vote as was done by the KMT with the referendums associated with the 2004 presidential election.

A DPP proposal to allow the citizens the right to initiate constitutional referendums was pulled off the table, due to a lack of support. The proposal was criticized for dangerously lowering the threshold for considering a constitutional amendment. Whereas a three-fourths vote of the LY would require that any proposed constitutional amendment have a broad political consensus behind it, a citizen&#x27;s initiative would allow a fraction of the electorate to force a constitutional referendum. It was feared that allowing this to occur would result in a referendum on Taiwan independence which would likely result in a crisis with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The Legislative Yuan also proposed to give itself the power to summon the president for an annual &quot;state of the nation&quot; address and launch a recall of the president and vice president (proposed by one fourth and approved by two thirds of the legislators and be submitted to a nationwide referendum for approval or rejection by majority vote). The Legislative Yuan will also have the power to propose the impeachment of the president or vice president to the Council of Grand Justices.

An &quot;ad hoc&quot; National Assembly was elected and formed in 2005 to ratify the amendments. The downsized Legislative Yuan took effect after the 2008 elections.

On 20 July 2007, the Legislative Yuan passed a Lobbying Act.

==Elections and terms==

The Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the year following the first legislative elections (1948) after the enactment of the 1947 constitution. As the Kuomintang government continues to claim sovereignty over Mainland China, the term of the original legislators was extended until &quot;re-election is possible in their original electoral districts.&quot; In response to the increasing democracy movement in Taiwan, limited supplementary elections were held in Taiwan starting from 1969 and parts of Fujian from 1972. Legislators elected in these supplementary elections served together with those who were elected in 1948. This situation remained until a Constitutional Court (Judicial Yuan) ruling on 21 June 1991 that ordered the retirement of all members with extended terms by the end of 1991.
Timeline of Legislative Yuan elections and terms

The legislature had 225 members during the 4th, 5th, and 6th terms. Legislators were elected as follows:
* 168 were elected by popular vote through single non-transferable vote in multi-member consistencies.
* 41 were elected on the basis of the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties.
* 8 were allocated for overseas citizens and were selected by the parties on the basis of the proportion of votes received nationwide.
* 8 seats were reserved for the indigenous populations.

Since the 7th term, the 113 legislators are elected to office as follows:
*73 are elected under the first-past-the-post system in single-member constituencies.
*34 are elected under the supplementary member system on a second ballot, based on nationwide votes, and calculated using the largest remainder method by the Hare quota. Any party which receives 5% or more of the party vote can enter the parliament. For each party, at least half of the legislators elected under this system must be female.
*6 seats are elected by indigenous voters through single non-transferable vote in two three-member constituencies.

== Composition by term ==
The Kuomintang (KMT) held a supermajority of seats in the Legislative Yuan between 1948 and 1991, while some seats were held by the Chinese Youth Party (CYP) and the China Democratic Socialist Party (CDSP). Through the limited supplementary elections held in since the 1970s, the Tangwai movement saw their share of seats increase. Most members in the Tangwai movement joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after its founding in the late 1980s.


==Issues==
===Protests and occupation===

On 18 March 2014, the Legislative Yuan was occupied by protesting students.

===Legislative violence===
Much of the work of the Legislative Yuan is done via legislative committees, and a common sight on Taiwanese television involves officials of the executive branch answering extremely hostile questions from opposition members in committees. In the 1990s, there were a number of cases of violence breaking out on the floor, usually triggered by some perceived unfair procedure ruling, but in recent years, these have become less common. There was a brawl involving 50 legislators in January 2007 and an incident involving 40 legislators on 8 May 2007 when a speaker attempted to speak about reconfiguring the Central Election Committee. It has been alleged that fights are staged and planned in advance. These antics led the scientific humor magazine &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; to award the Legislative Yuan its Ig Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 &quot;for demonstrating that politicians gain more by punching, kicking and gouging each other than by waging war against other nations&quot;. On 29 June 2020 more than 20 lawmakers affiliated with the Kuomintang took over the legislature over night, blocking entry to the main chamber with chains and chairs, saying the government was trying to force through legislation and demanding the president withdraw the nomination of a close aide to a high-level watchdog. Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers forced themselves in while there were scuffles and shouting with Kuomintang lawmakers. On 18 May 2024, a lawmaker attempted to steal a bill in an attempt to prevent it from being passed. This resulted in a brawl on the chamber floor due to the chaos. 

== Building ==
The current Legislative Yuan building in Taipei, was formerly the constructed during the Japanese colonial rule since 1960 with the administrative offices previously a dormitory. Over the years, there were several proposals to relocate the Legislative Yuan. The 1990 proposal to move the legislature to the location of the defunct Huashan station, was passed in 1992, then abandoned after the budget was cut. A second proposal in 1999 suggested that the legislature move to what had previously served as Air Force Command Headquarters. This proposition was opposed by the Taipei City Council and funds for disaster relief became a priority after the Jiji earthquake. Other relocation proposals include moving the parliament to Taichung, New Taipei, Changhua County, or Yilan County. In 2022, graduate students from several Taiwanese universities were invited to submit designs for a new building.

<text>Fiber (also spelled fibre in British English; from ) is a natural or artificial substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.

Synthetic fibers can often be produced very cheaply and in large amounts compared to natural fibers, but for clothing natural fibers have some benefits, such as comfort, over their synthetic counterparts.

== Natural fibers ==

Natural fibers develop or occur in the fiber shape, and include those produced by plants, animals, and geological processes. They can be classified according to their origin:
*Vegetable fibers are generally based on arrangements of cellulose, often with lignin: examples include cotton, hemp, jute, flax, abaca, piña, ramie, sisal, bagasse, and banana. Plant fibers are employed in the manufacture of paper and textile (cloth), and dietary fiber is an important component of human nutrition.
*Wood fiber, distinguished from vegetable fiber, is from tree sources. Forms include groundwood, lacebark, thermomechanical pulp (TMP), and bleached or unbleached kraft or sulfite pulps. Kraft and sulfite refer to the type of pulping process used to remove the lignin bonding the original wood structure, thus freeing the fibers for use in paper and engineered wood products such as fiberboard.
*Animal fibers consist largely of particular proteins. Instances are silkworm silk, spider silk, sinew, catgut, wool, sea silk and hair such as cashmere wool, mohair and angora, fur such as sheepskin, rabbit, mink, fox, beaver, etc.
*Mineral fibers include the asbestos group. Asbestos is the only naturally occurring long mineral fiber. Six minerals have been classified as &quot;asbestos&quot; including chrysotile of the serpentine class and those belonging to the amphibole class: amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite. Short, fiber-like minerals include wollastonite and palygorskite.
*Biological fibers, also known as fibrous proteins or protein filaments, consist largely of biologically relevant and biologically very important proteins, in which mutations or other genetic defects can lead to severe diseases. Instances include the collagen family of proteins, tendons, muscle proteins like actin, cell proteins like microtubules and many others, such as spider silk, sinew, and hair.

==Artificial fibers==
Artificial or chemical fibers are fibers whose chemical composition, structure, and properties are significantly modified during the manufacturing process. In fashion, a fiber is a long and thin strand or thread of material that can be knit or woven into a fabric. Artificial fibers consist of regenerated fibers and synthetic fibers.
===Semi-synthetic fibers===
Semi-synthetic fibers are made from raw materials with naturally long-chain polymer structure and are only modified and partially degraded by chemical processes, in contrast to completely synthetic fibers such as nylon (polyamide) or dacron (polyester), which the chemist synthesizes from low-molecular weight compounds by polymerization (chain-building) reactions. The earliest semi-synthetic fiber is the cellulose regenerated fiber, rayon. Most semi-synthetic fibers are cellulose regenerated fibers.

====Cellulose regenerated fibers====
Cellulose fibers are a subset of artificial fibers, regenerated from natural cellulose. The cellulose comes from various sources: rayon from tree wood fiber, bamboo fiber from bamboo, seacell from seaweed, etc. In the production of these fibers, the cellulose is reduced to a fairly pure form as a viscous mass and formed into fibers by extrusion through spinnerets. Therefore, the manufacturing process leaves few characteristics distinctive of the natural source material in the finished products.

Some examples of this fiber type are:
* rayon
* Lyocell, a brand of rayon
* Modal
* diacetate fiber
* triacetate fiber.

Historically, cellulose diacetate and -triacetate were classified under the term rayon, but are now considered distinct materials.

===Synthetic fibers===
Synthetic come entirely from synthetic materials such as petrochemicals, unlike those artificial fibers derived from such natural substances as cellulose or protein.

Fiber classification in reinforced plastics falls into two classes: (i) short fibers, also known as discontinuous fibers, with a general aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of fiber length to diameter) between 20 and 60, and (ii) long fibers, also known as continuous fibers, the general aspect ratio is between 200 and 500.

====Metallic fibers====

Metallic fibers can be drawn from ductile metals such as copper, gold or silver and extruded or deposited from more brittle ones, such as nickel, aluminum or iron.

====Carbon fiber====
Carbon fibers are often based on oxidized and via pyrolysis carbonized polymers like PAN, but the end product is almost pure carbon.

====Silicon carbide fiber====
Silicon carbide fibers, where the basic polymers are not hydrocarbons but polymers, where about 50% of the carbon atoms are replaced by silicon atoms, so-called poly-carbo-silanes. The pyrolysis yields an amorphous silicon carbide, including mostly other elements like oxygen, titanium, or aluminium, but with mechanical properties very similar to those of carbon fibers.

====Fiberglass====
Fiberglass, made from specific glass, and optical fiber, made from purified natural quartz, are also artificial fibers that come from natural raw materials, silica fiber, made from sodium silicate (water glass) and basalt fiber made from melted basalt.

====Mineral fibers====
Mineral fibers can be particularly strong because they are formed with a low number of surface defects; asbestos is a common one.

====Polymer fibers====
* Polymer fibers are a subset of artificial fibers, which are based on synthetic chemicals (often from petrochemical sources) rather than arising from natural materials by a purely physical process. These fibers are made from:
** polyamide nylon
** PET or PBT polyester
** phenol-formaldehyde (PF)
** polyvinyl chloride fiber (PVC) vinyon
** polyolefins (PP and PE) olefin fiber
** acrylic polyesters, pure polyester PAN fibers are used to make carbon fiber by roasting them in a low oxygen environment. Traditional acrylic fiber is used more often as a synthetic replacement for wool. Carbon fibers and PF fibers are noted as two resin-based fibers that are not thermoplastic, most others can be melted.
** aromatic polyamids (aramids) such as Twaron, Kevlar and Nomex thermally degrade at high temperatures and do not melt. These fibers have strong bonding between polymer chains
** polyethylene (PE), eventually with extremely long chains / HMPE (e.g. Dyneema or Spectra).
** Elastomers can even be used, e.g. spandex although urethane fibers are starting to replace spandex technology.
** polyurethane fiber
** Elastolefin
* Coextruded fibers have two distinct polymers forming the fiber, usually as a core-sheath or side by side. Coated fibers exist such as nickel-coated to provide static elimination, silver-coated to provide anti-bacterial properties and aluminum-coated to provide RF deflection for radar chaff. Radar chaff is actually a spool of continuous glass tow that has been aluminum coated. An aircraft-mounted high speed cutter chops it up as it spews from a moving aircraft to confuse radar signals.

====Microfibers====
Invented in Japan in the early 1980s, microfibers are also known as microdenier fibers. Acrylic, nylon, polyester, lyocell and rayon can be produced as microfibers. In 1986, Hoechst A.G. of Germany produced microfiber in Europe. This fiber made it way into the United States in 1990 by DuPont.

Microfibers in textiles refer to sub-denier fiber (such as polyester drawn to 0.5 denier). Denier and Dtex are two measurements of fiber yield based on weight and length. If the fiber density is known, you also have a fiber diameter, otherwise it is simpler to measure diameters in micrometers. Microfibers in technical fibers refer to ultra-fine fibers (glass or meltblown thermoplastics) often used in filtration. Newer fiber designs include extruding fiber that splits into multiple finer fibers. Most synthetic fibers are round in cross-section, but special designs can be hollow, oval, star-shaped or trilobal. The latter design provides more optically reflective properties. Synthetic textile fibers are often crimped to provide bulk in a woven, non woven or knitted structure. Fiber surfaces can also be dull or bright. Dull surfaces reflect more light while bright tends to transmit light and make the fiber more transparent.

Very short and/or irregular fibers have been called fibrils. Natural cellulose, such as cotton or bleached kraft, show smaller fibrils jutting out and away from the main fiber structure.

== Typical properties of selected fibers ==
Fibers can be divided into natural and artificial (synthetic) substance, their properties can affect their performance in many applications. Synthetic fiber materials are increasingly replacing other conventional materials like glass and wood in a number of applications. This is because artificial fibers can be engineered chemically, physically, and mechanically to suit particular technical engineering. In choosing a fiber type, a manufacturer would balance their properties with the technical requirements of the applications. Various fibers are available to select for manufacturing. Here are typical properties of the sample natural fibers as compared to the properties of artificial fibers. 

The tables above just show typical properties of fibers, in fact there are more properties which could be referred as follows (from a to z):

Arc Resistance, Biodegradable, Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion, Continuous Service Temperature, Density of Plastics, Ductile / Brittle Transition Temperature, Elongation at Break, Elongation at Yield, Fire Resistance, Flexibility, Gamma Radiation Resistance, Gloss, Glass Transition Temperature, Hardness, Heat Deflection Temperature, Shrinkage, Stiffness, Ultimate tensile strength, Thermal Insulation, Toughness, Transparency, UV Light Resistance, Volume Resistivity, Water absorption, Young&#x27;s Modulus
