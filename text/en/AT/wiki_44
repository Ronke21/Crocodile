<text>Nidaros Cathedral () is a Church of Norway cathedral located in the city of Trondheim in Trøndelag county. It is built over the burial site of King Olav II (c. 995–1030, reigned 1015–1028), who became the patron saint of the nation, and is the traditional location for the consecration of new Norwegian monarchs. It was built over a 230-year period, from 1070 to 1300 when it was substantially completed. However additional work, additions and renovations have continued intermittently since then, including a major reconstruction starting in 1869 and completed in 2001.

In 1152, the church was designated as the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros. In 1537, during the Protestant Reformation, it became part of the newly established state Church of Norway. It is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world.

The cathedral is the main church for the &quot;Nidaros og Vår Frue&quot; parish, the seat of the Nidaros domprosti (arch-deanery), and the seat of the Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros. The Preses of the Church of Norway is also based at this cathedral. The church seats about 1,850 people.

==History==

Nidaros Cathedral was built beginning in 1070 to memorialize the burial place of Olav II of Norway, the king who was killed in 1030 in the Battle of Stiklestad. He was canonized as Saint Olav a year later by Grimketel, the Bishop of Nidaros (the canonization was later confirmed by the pope). Around 1070, King Olav Kyrre, who was St. Olav&#x27;s nephew, began building a large stone church on the site where the wooden church had stood. It was dedicated to the Holy Trinity but was commonly called Kristkirken (an earlier term for cathedral). The altar in this church was to be placed over the grave, and when the church was completed around 1090, St. Olav&#x27;s shrine was moved here and placed over the altar. In this church, almost all Norwegian royals of the 11th and 12th centuries were buried. Kristkirken was about 50 meters long with a choir, nave, and west tower, and it was the largest church in Norway at the time.

Nothing of Olav Kyrre&#x27;s church is visible today. It was gradually replaced by new building parts in the 13th century, but its outline can be seen in the ground plan: as was often the case in the Middle Ages, the later walls were built on the old foundations to save time and costs. During the restoration in the late 19th century, these foundations were excavated and measured, providing some knowledge of the church&#x27;s architecture.

It was designated the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros from its establishment in 1152 until its abolition in 1537 under the Reformation.

Since the Reformation, it has served as the cathedral of the Lutheran bishops of Trondheim (or Nidaros) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The architectural style of the cathedral is Romanesque and Gothic. Historically it has been an important destination for pilgrims coming from all of Northern Europe.

In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway&#x27;s first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called &quot;electors&quot; who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.

Along with Vår Frue Church, the cathedral is part of the &quot;Nidaros og Vår Frue&quot; parish in the Nidaros deanery in the Diocese of Nidaros.

==Building and restoration==


Work on the cathedral as a memorial to St. Olav started in 1070. It was finished some time around 1300, nearly 150 years after being established as the cathedral of the diocese. The cathedral was badly damaged by fires in 1327 and again in 1531. The nave was destroyed and was not rebuilt until the restoration in early 1900s.

In 1708, the church burned down completely except for the stone walls. It was struck by lightning in 1719, and was again ravaged by fire. Major rebuilding and restoration of the cathedral started in 1869, initially led by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer, and nearly completed by Christian Christie. It was officially completed in 2001. Maintenance of the cathedral is an ongoing process.

The oldest parts of the cathedral consist of the octagon with its surrounding ambulatory. This was the site of the original high altar, with the reliquary casket of Saint Olav, and choir. Design of the octagon may have been inspired by the Corona of Canterbury Cathedral, although octagonal shrines have a long history in Christian architecture. Similarly, the choir shows English influence, and appears to have been modeled after the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral.

It is joined to the octagon by a stone screen that fills the entire east side of the choir. The principal arch of this screen is subdivided into three subsidiary arches: the central arch frames a statue of Christ the Teacher, standing on the top of a central arch of three subsidiary arches below him. The space above the principal arch, corresponding to the vault of the choir, contains a crucifix by the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, placed between statues of the Virgin Mary and the Apostle John. Built into the south side of the ambulatory is a small well. A bucket could be lowered to draw up water drawn from the spring that originated from St. Olav&#x27;s original burial place. (This was covered over by the construction of later cathedrals).

The present cathedral has two principal altars. At the east end of the chancel in the octagon is an altar at the site of the medieval high altar, behind which stood the silver reliquary casket containing the remains of St. Olav. This silver-gilt reliquary casket was melted down for coinage by Christian II and St. Olav&#x27;s remains buried in an unknown location under the cathedral. The only relic known to have survived is a femur in a silver-gilt reliquary. Shaped as a forearm, it was given by Queen Josephine to St. Olav Catholic Cathedral in Oslo. The original reliquary casket was in the form of a church, with dragon heads on its gables. The dragons are similar to those carved on the gables of Norwegian stave churches. Surviving medieval reliquary caskets in Norway frequently also bear such dragon heads, for instance, that at Heddal Stave Church. He was the church&#x27;s and the kingdom&#x27;s patron saint. The current altar was designed to recall in marble sculpture the essential form of this reliquary casket. It replaces the previous baroque altar, which was transferred to Vår Frue Church.

The second altar is in the crossing, where the transept intersects the nave and the chancel. It bears a large modern silver crucifix. It was commissioned and paid for by Norwegian American emigrants in the early twentieth century, and the design was inspired by the memory of a similar silver crucifix in the medieval church. The medieval chapter house may also be used as a chapel for smaller groups of worshipers.

All the stained glass in the cathedral dates from its rebuilding in the 19th and 20th centuries. The windows on the north side of the church depict scenes from the Old Testament against a blue background, while those on the south side of the church depict scenes from the New Testament against a red background.

==Organs==

Two organs are installed in the cathedral. The main organ was built by the Steinmeyer firm in 1930, and was erected in the north transept. It then had 125 stops. Installation of the Steinmeyer organ was commissioned in 1930 for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Stiklestad. The organ was funded mostly by donations, particularly by Elias Anton Cappelen Smith. In 1962, the organ was heavily rebuilt and moved to the west nave. Many stops were removed; some of them were used to build a new choir organ. This organ was fully restored in 2014.

The old Baroque organ built by noted German organ builder Joachim Wagner (1690–1749) during the period 1738–40 was carefully restored by Jürgen Ahrend between 1993 and 1994. It has 30 stops and is located at a gallery in the north transept.

==Tourist attraction==
Today, the cathedral is a popular tourist attraction. Nidaros Cathedral is the site of the observation of Olav&#x27;s Wake (). This religious and cultural festival is centered upon the anniversary of the death of Saint Olav at the Battle of Stiklestad. Tourists often follow the historic Pilgrim&#x27;s Route () to visit the cathedral for this and other events.

==Alleged bombing plot==
The cathedral is also familiar to enthusiasts of Norwegian black metal, as it is featured on the cover artwork of &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;, the 1994 studio album by Mayhem. It was rumored that members of the band who had already been associated with the 
burnings of other Christian churches in Norway had planned to destroy the cathedral in relation to the release of the album. When police arrested former Mayhem bassist Varg Vikernes on 19 August 1993 they had found of explosives in his home.

<doc id="142292" wikidata="Q153803" url="?curid=142292" title="John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough">
<text>General John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, 1st Prince of Mindelheim, 1st Count of Nellenburg, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, (26 May 1650 – 16 June 1722 O.S.) was a British army officer and statesman. From a gentry family, he served as a page at the court of the House of Stuart under James, Duke of York, through the 1670s and early 1680s, earning military and political advancement through his courage and diplomatic skill. He is known for never having lost a battle.

Churchill&#x27;s role in defeating the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 helped secure James on the throne, but he was a key player in the military conspiracy that led to James being deposed during the Glorious Revolution. Rewarded by William III with the title Earl of Marlborough, persistent charges of Jacobitism led to his fall from office and temporary imprisonment in the Tower of London. William recognised his abilities by appointing him as his deputy in Southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) before the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701, but not until the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 did he secure his fame and fortune.

Marriage to Sarah Jennings and her relationship with Anne ensured Marlborough&#x27;s rise, first to the captain-generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. As de facto leader of Allied forces in the Low Countries, his victories at battles of Blenheim (1704), of Ramillies (1706), of Oudenarde (1708), and of Malplaquet (1709) ensured his place in history as one of Europe&#x27;s great generals. His wife&#x27;s stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, was central to his own fall. Incurring Anne&#x27;s disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to favour with the accession of George I to the throne in 1714, but a stroke in 1716 ended his career.

Marlborough&#x27;s leadership of the main Allied army against Louis XIV from 1701 to 1711 helped to consolidate Britain&#x27;s emergence as a front-rank power, while his ability to maintain unity in the fractious coalition demonstrated his diplomatic skills. He is often remembered by military historians as much for his organisational and logistic skills as his tactical abilities. Marlborough&#x27;s military exploits have resulted in successive historians describing him as one of the modern era&#x27;s finest military commanders.

==Early life (1650–1678)==

=== Family ===

Churchill was the second but eldest-surviving son of Sir Winston Churchill of Glanvilles Wootton, Dorset, and Elizabeth Drake, whose family came from Ash, Devon. Winston served with the Royalist army in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms; he was heavily fined for doing so, forcing his family to live at Ash House with his mother-in-law. John Churchill was a descendant of Edward I through his daughter, Joan of Acre.

After the 1660 Restoration of Charles II, Winston became Member of Parliament for Weymouth and from 1662 served as Commissioner for Irish Land Claims in Dublin. On returning to London in 1663, he was knighted and received a position at Whitehall, with John attending St Paul&#x27;s School.

The family fortune was made in 1665 when Arabella Churchill became maid of honour to Anne Hyde and began an affair with her husband, James, Duke of York. This lasted over a decade; James had four acknowledged children by her, including James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick. Their relationship led to appointments for her brothers; John was appointed page to James, and in September 1667 made an ensign in the Foot Guards.

=== Army entry ===

Claims that Churchill served with the Tangier Garrison cannot be confirmed, but he is recorded as being with Sir Thomas Allin in the Mediterranean from March to November 1670. He returned to London, where in February 1671 he engaged in a duel with Sir John Fenwick. He allegedly had an affair with Barbara Villiers, a mistress of Charles II, and may have fathered her daughter Barbara Fitzroy, although he never formally acknowledged her.

In 1670 Treaty of Dover, Charles II agreed to support a French attack on the Dutch Republic and supply a British brigade of 6,000 troops for the French army. Louis XIV paid him £230,000 per year for this. When the Franco-Dutch War began in 1672, Churchill was present at the Battle of Solebay on 28 May, possibly aboard James&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Prince&quot;, which was crippled.

Shortly thereafter, Churchill was commissioned Captain in the Duke of York&#x27;s Admiralty Regiment, part of the British brigade, commanded by the Duke of Monmouth. The alliance with Catholic France was extremely unpopular and many doubted the brigade&#x27;s reliability against the Dutch. As a result, it served in the Rhineland against the Holy Roman Empire, although Churchill, Monmouth and other volunteers took part in the French siege of Maastricht.

England withdrew from the war with the 1674 Treaty of Westminster, but to keep his subsidies, Charles encouraged members of the Anglo-Scots force to remain in French service; many did so, including Monmouth and Churchill, who became Colonel of one such regiment, serving under Marshal Turenne. He was present at Sinsheim in June 1674, Enzheim in October, and possibly at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.
Sometime around 1675, Churchill met the 15-year-old Sarah Jennings, who came from a similar background of minor Royalist gentry, ruined by the war. The family moved to London after her father died and in 1673, Sarah and her sister Frances joined the household of Mary of Modena, James&#x27;s second Catholic wife. Despite opposition from his father, who wanted him to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley, Churchill married Sarah in the winter of 1677–78, helped by Mary.

The couple had five children who survived to adulthood: Henrietta Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, Lady Anne Churchill, John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford, Elizabeth, and Mary.

==Early service (1678–1700)==

=== Crisis ===
In November 1677, William of Orange married James&#x27;s eldest daughter, Mary, and in March 1678, the Earl of Danby negotiated an Anglo-Dutch defensive alliance. Churchill was sent to the Hague to make arrangements for an expeditionary force, although English troops did not arrive in significant numbers until after the Peace of Nijmegen ended the war on 10 August.

James publicly confirmed his conversion to Catholicism in 1673; as heir to the throne, this led to a political crisis that dominated English politics from 1679 to 1681. In the 1679 General Election, Churchill was elected MP for Newtown; the majority supported James&#x27;s exclusion and he spent the next three years in exile, Churchill acting as his liaison with the court.
Charles defeated the Exclusionists and dismissed Parliament in 1681, allowing James to return to London. In 1682, Churchill was made Lord Churchill of Eyemouth in the peerage of Scotland and the following year, colonel of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons. These rewards allowed him to live in some style and comfort; in addition to a house in London, he purchased Holywell House, near St Albans. He also gained control of the Parliamentary constituency of St Albans; his brother George held the seat from 1685 to 1708.

Charles Churchill served at the Danish court, where he became friends with Prince George of Denmark, who married James&#x27;s younger daughter Anne in 1683. His senior aide was Colonel Charles Griffin, brother-in-law to Sarah, appointed Lady of the Bedchamber to Anne. The Churchills and their relatives formed a central part of the so-called &#x27;Cockpit circle&#x27; of Anne&#x27;s friends, named after her apartments in Whitehall. Churchill was reportedly concerned at being too closely associated with James, particularly since Sarah&#x27;s sister Frances was married to Irish Catholic Richard Talbot, appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1687. This was offset by their connection with the Protestant Anne, while Sarah herself was renowned for being virulently anti-Catholic.

===Rebellion===
Despite his Catholicism, James succeeded Charles as king in February 1685 with widespread support. Many feared his exclusion would lead to a repetition of the 16381651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms but tolerance for his personal beliefs did not apply to Catholicism in general. His support collapsed when his policies appeared to threaten the primacy of the Church of England and created the instability his supporters wished to avoid.

This preference for stability led to the rapid defeat in June 1685 of Argyll&#x27;s Rising in Scotland and the Monmouth Rebellion in western England. In the campaign against Monmouth, Churchill led the infantry, under the command of the Earl of Feversham, at Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, defeating the rebels and effectively putting an end to the rebellion. Although subordinate to Feversham, Churchill&#x27;s administrative capacity, tactical skill, and courage in battle were pivotal in the victory.

In recognition of his contribution, he was promoted Major General and given the colonelcy of the Third Troop of Life Guards. In May, he had been made Baron Churchill of Sandridge, giving him a seat in the House of Lords, which led to the first open breach with James; Lord Delamere was accused of involvement in the rebellion and tried by 30 members of the House of Lords, including Churchill. As the most junior peer, he went first and his vote for acquittal was viewed as giving a lead to others; Delamere was set free, much to James&#x27;s annoyance.

As early as 1682, Churchill was recorded as being uneasy at James&#x27;s obstinacy. The conviction he was always right often resulted in what many viewed as vindictive behaviour, including Monmouth&#x27;s clumsy execution and the persecution of his followers by Judge Jeffreys. This provides the immediate context for Delamere&#x27;s acquittal but shortly after the Coronation, Churchill reputedly told French Protestant Henri de Massue that &quot;If the King should attempt to change our religion, I will instantly quit his service.&quot;

===Revolution===

Churchill emerged from the Sedgemoor campaign with great credit, but he was anxious not to be seen as sympathetic towards the King&#x27;s growing religious ardour against the Protestant establishment. James II&#x27;s promotion of Catholics in royal institutions – including the army – engendered first suspicion, and ultimately sedition in his mainly Protestant subjects; even members of his own family expressed alarm at the King&#x27;s zeal for Roman Catholicism.

When the queen gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, it opened up the prospect of successive Catholic monarchs. Some in the King&#x27;s service, such as the Earl of Salisbury and the Earl of Melfort, converted to Catholicism and were seen as having betrayed their Protestant upbringing to gain favour at court. Churchill remained true to his conscience, telling the King, &quot;I have been bred a Protestant, and intend to live and die in that communion&quot;, although he was also motivated by self-interest. Believing that the monarch&#x27;s policy would either wreck his own career or generate a wider insurrection, he did not intend, like his unfortunate father before him, to be on the losing side.
Seven men met to draft the invitation to the Protestant Dutch Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange, to invade England and assume the throne. The signatories to the letter included Whigs, Tories, and the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, who assured the Prince that, &quot;Nineteen parts of twenty of the people ... are desirous of change&quot;.

William needed no further encouragement. Although the invitation was not signed by Churchill (he was not, as yet, of sufficient political rank), he declared his intention through William&#x27;s principal English contact in The Hague – &quot;If you think there is anything else that I ought to do, you have but to command me&quot;.

William landed at Brixham on 5 November 1688 (O.S.); from there, he moved his army to Exeter. James&#x27;s forces – once again commanded by Lord Feversham – moved to Salisbury, but few of its senior officers were eager to fight – even Princess Anne wrote to William to wish him &quot;good success in this so just an undertaking&quot;. Promoted to Lieutenant-General on 7 November (O.S.) Churchill was still at the King&#x27;s side, but his displaying &quot;the greatest transports of joy imaginable&quot; at the desertion of Lord Cornbury led Feversham to call for his arrest. Churchill himself had openly encouraged defection to the Orangist cause, but James continued to hesitate. Soon it was too late to act. After the meeting of the council of war on the morning of 24 November (O.S.), Churchill, accompanied by some 400 officers and men, slipped from the royal camp and rode towards William in Axminster, leaving behind him a letter of apology and self-justification:
I hope the great advantage I enjoy under Your Majesty, which I own I would never expect in any other change of government, may reasonably convince Your Majesty and the world that I am actuated by a higher principle ...

When the King saw that he could not keep even Churchill – for so long his loyal servant – he despaired. James II, who in the words of the Archbishop of Rheims, had &quot;given up three kingdoms for a Mass&quot;, fled to France, taking with him his son and heir.

==William&#x27;s general==
As part of William III and Mary II&#x27;s coronation honours, Churchill was created Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); he was also sworn as a member of the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King&#x27;s Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James&#x27;s supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough&#x27;s apologists, including his biographer and most notable descendant Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of David G. Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.

Marlborough&#x27;s first official act was to assist in the remodeling of the army – the power of confirming or purging officers and men allowed the Earl to build a new patronage network that would prove beneficial over the next two decades. His task was urgent, for less than six months after James II&#x27;s departure, England joined the war against France as part of a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing the ambitions of Louis XIV. With his experience it was logical that Marlborough took charge of the 8,000 English troops sent to the Low Countries in the spring of 1689; yet throughout the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–97) he saw only three years service in the field, and then mostly in subordinate commands. However, at the Battle of Walcourt on 25 August 1689 Marlborough won praise from the Allied commander, Prince Waldeck – &quot;despite his youth he displayed greater military capacity than do most generals after a long series of wars ... He is assuredly one of the most gallant men I know&quot;.

Since Walcourt, though, Marlborough&#x27;s popularity at court had waned. William and Mary distrusted both Lord and Lady Marlborough&#x27;s influence as confidants and supporters of Princess Anne (whose claim to the throne was stronger than William&#x27;s). Sarah had supported Anne in a series of court disputes with the joint monarchs, infuriating Mary who included the Earl in her disfavour of his wife. Yet for the moment the clash of tempers was over-shadowed by more pressing events in Ireland where James had landed in March 1689 in an attempt to regain his thrones. When William left for Ireland in June 1690 Marlborough became commander of all troops and militia in England and was appointed a member of the Council of Nine to advise Mary on military matters in the King&#x27;s absence, but she made scant effort to disguise her distaste at his appointment – &quot;I can neither trust or esteem him&quot;, she wrote to William.

William III&#x27;s victory at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 (O.S.) forced James II to abandon his army and flee back to France. In August Marlborough himself left for Ireland engaged upon his first independent command – a land/sea operation upon the southern ports of Cork and Kinsale. It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success. Cork fell on 27 September (O.S.), and Kinsale followed in mid-October. Although the campaign did not end the war in Ireland as Marlborough hoped, it taught him the significance of the minutiae of logistics, and the importance of cooperation and tact when working alongside other senior Allied commanders. It would, however, be more than ten years before he once again took charge in the field.

===Dismissal and disgrace===
William III recognised Marlborough&#x27;s qualities as a soldier and strategist, but the refusal of the Order of the Garter and failure to appoint him Master-General of the Ordnance rankled with the ambitious Earl; nor did Marlborough conceal his bitter disappointment behind his usual bland discretion. Using his influence in Parliament and the army, Marlborough aroused dissatisfaction concerning William&#x27;s preferences for foreign commanders, an exercise designed to force the King&#x27;s hand. Aware of this, William, in turn, began to speak openly of his distrust of Marlborough; the Elector of Brandenburg&#x27;s envoy to London overheard the King remark that he had been treated – &quot;so infamously by Marlborough that, had he not been King, he would have felt it necessary to challenge him to a duel&quot;.

Since January 1691 Marlborough had been in contact with the exiled James II in Saint-Germain, anxious to obtain the erstwhile King&#x27;s pardon for deserting him in 1688 – a pardon essential for the success of his future career in the not altogether unlikely event of a Jacobite restoration. James himself maintained contact with his supporters in England whose principal object was to re-establish him upon his throne. William was well aware of these contacts (as well as others such as Baron Godolphin and the Duke of Shrewsbury), but their double-dealing was seen more like an insurance policy, rather than as an explicit commitment. Marlborough did not wish for a Jacobite restoration, but William was conscious of his military and political qualities, and the danger the Earl posed: &quot;William was not prone to fear&quot;, wrote Thomas Macaulay, &quot;but if there was anyone on earth that he feared, it was Marlborough&quot;.

By the time William and Marlborough had returned from an uneventful campaign in the Spanish Netherlands in October 1691, their relationship had further deteriorated. In January 1692, the Queen, angered by Marlborough&#x27;s intrigues in Parliament, the army, and even with Saint-Germain, ordered Anne to dismiss Sarah from her household – Anne refused. This personal dispute precipitated Marlborough&#x27;s dismissal. On 30 January 1692 (20 January 1691 O.S.), the Earl of Nottingham, Secretary of State, ordered Marlborough to dispose of all his posts and offices, both civil and military, and consider himself dismissed from all appointments and forbidden the court. No reasons were given but Marlborough&#x27;s chief associates were outraged: Shrewsbury voiced his disapproval and Godolphin threatened to retire from government. Admiral Russell, now commander-in-chief of the Navy, personally accused the King of ingratitude to the man who had &quot;set the crown upon his head&quot;.

===High treason===
The nadir of Marlborough&#x27;s fortunes had not yet been reached. The spring of 1692 brought renewed threats of a French invasion and new accusations of Jacobite treachery. Acting on the testimony of one Robert Young, the Queen had arrested all the signatories to a letter purporting the restoration of James II and the seizure of William III. Marlborough, as one of these signatories, was sent to the Tower of London on 4 May (O.S.) where he languished for five weeks; his anguish compounded by the news of the death of his younger son Charles on 22 May (O.S.). Young&#x27;s letters were eventually discredited as forgeries and Marlborough was released on 15 June (O.S.), but he continued his correspondence with James, leading to the celebrated incident of the &quot;Camaret Bay letter&quot; of 1694.

For several months the Allies had been planning an attack on Brest, the French port in the West of Brittany. The French had received intelligence alerting them to the imminent assault, enabling Marshal Vauban to strengthen its defences and reinforce the garrison. Inevitably the attack on 18 June led by Thomas Tollemache ended in disaster; most of his men were killed or captured, and Tollemache died of his wounds shortly afterward. Despite lacking evidence, Marlborough&#x27;s detractors claimed that it was he who had alerted the enemy. Macaulay states that in a letter on 3 May 1694 Marlborough betrayed the Allied plans to James, thus ensuring that the landing failed and that Tollemache, a talented rival, was killed or discredited as a direct result. Historians such as John Paget and C. T. Atkinson conclude that he probably did write the letter, but did so only when he knew that it would be received too late for its information to be of any practical use (the plan of the attack on Brest was widely known, and the French had already begun to strengthen their defences in April). To Richard Holmes, the evidence linking Marlborough with the Camaret Bay letter (which no longer exists), is slender, concluding, &quot;It is very hard to imagine a man as careful as Marlborough, only recently freed from suspicion of treason, writing a letter which would kill him if it fell into the wrong hands&quot;. However, David Chandler surmises that &quot;the whole episode is so obscure and inconclusive that it is still not possible to make a definite ruling&quot;.

===Reconciliation===
Mary&#x27;s death on 28 December 1694 (O.S.) eventually led to a formal but cool reconciliation between William III and Anne, now heir to the throne. Marlborough hoped that the rapprochement would lead to his own return to office, but although he and Lady Marlborough were allowed to return to court, the Earl received no offer of employment.

In 1696 Marlborough, together with Godolphin, Russell, and Shrewsbury, was yet again implicated in a treasonous plot with James II, this time instigated by the Jacobite militant John Fenwick. The accusations were eventually dismissed as a fabrication and Fenwick executed – the King himself had remained incredulous – but it was not until 1698, a year after the Treaty of Ryswick brought an end to the Nine Years&#x27; War, that the corner was finally turned in William&#x27;s and Marlborough&#x27;s relationship. On the recommendation of Lord Sunderland (whose wife was a close friend of Lady Marlborough), William eventually offered Marlborough the post of governor to the Duke of Gloucester, Anne&#x27;s eldest son; he was also restored to the Privy Council, together with his military rank. When William left for Holland in July, Marlborough was one of the Lords Justices left running the government in his absence; but striving to reconcile his close Tory connections with that of the dutiful royal servant was difficult, leading Marlborough to complain – &quot;The King&#x27;s coldness to me still continues&quot;.

==War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714)==

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the single most important theme in European politics was the rivalry between the House of Habsburg and the House of Bourbon. In 1665, the infirm and childless Habsburg Charles II became the King of Spain. Spain was no longer the dominant global power it once was but remained a vast global confederation, with possessions in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and large parts of the Americas. It proved remarkably resilient; when Charles died in 1700, it was largely intact and had even expanded in areas like the Pacific. Its possession could change the balance of power in favour of either France or Austria.

Attempts to partition the Empire between the French and Austrian candidates or install an alternative from the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty failed. When Charles died, he left his throne to Louis XIV&#x27;s grandson, who became Philip V of Spain on 16 November 1700. However, this was on condition Philip renounced his claim to the French throne; Louis&#x27; decision to ignore this once again threatened French domination over Europe and led to the Grand Alliance being reformed in 1701.
With his health deteriorating, William III appointed Marlborough Ambassador-Extraordinary and commander of English forces to attend the conference at the Hague. On 7 September 1701, the Treaty of the Second Grand Alliance nominated Emperor Leopold I&#x27;s second son Archduke Charles as King of Spain instead of Phillip. It was signed by England, the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire represented by Emperor Leopold I, head of the Austrian Habsburgs; however, the increasing independence of German states within the Empire meant Bavaria now allied itself with France.

William III died on 8 March 1702 (O.S.) from injuries sustained in a riding accident and was succeeded by his sister-in-law Anne. While his death was expected, it deprived the Alliance of its most obvious leader although Marlborough&#x27;s personal position was further strengthened by his close relationship with the new Queen. Anne appointed him Master-General of the Ordnance, a Knight of the Garter and Captain-General of her armies at home and abroad. Lady Marlborough was made Groom of the Stool, Mistress of the Robes and Keeper of the Privy Purse giving them a combined annual income of over £60,000 and unrivaled influence at court.

During the war, Marlborough, along with Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius and Prince Eugene of Savoy, would come to form the triumvirate that, in various respects, governed Europe during the War of the Spanish Succession.

===Early campaigns===

On 4 May 1702 (O.S.), England formally declared war on France, and Marlborough was given supreme command over the Anglo-Dutch army. News of his appointment led to some consternation, as he had never commanded a field army and had less military experience than dozen or so Dutch and German generals now under his command. Moreover, since he was an Englishman the Dutch States General wanted to prevent English political and military interests from being prioritised over those of the Dutch. As such, the States General placed severe limits on his military powers, which were defined in 12 articles. The most notable articles stated that:

# (Article 2) Marlborough was only allowed to command Dutch troops that were part of the combined Anglo-Dutch field army.
# (Article 3) Marlborough always had to formulate his operational plans in consultation with the highest-ranking Dutch general, who was also authorised to ask his subordinates for advice.
# (Article 4) Marlborough had to take all his decisions in agreement with the Dutch general and field deputies.
# (Article 6) Marlborough was not allowed to give orders to Dutch troops independently of senior Dutch officers.

As supreme commander of the Anglo-Dutch army, he had to coordinate all his plans with highest-ranking Dutch commander and had the power to give orders to the other Dutch officers only when their troops were in action with his own. In cases of disagreement between Marlborough and the Dutch general, Marlborough could not push through his plan; instead, the Dutch deputies, the political representatives of the States General, had to make the final decision. This meant that he often had to rely on his powers of tact and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies. The Dutch were primarily concerned by the threat of a French invasion, yet despite their initial lassitude the Allied campaign in the Low Countries (the war&#x27;s principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he and Athlone captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.

On 9 February 1703 (O.S.), soon after the Marlboroughs&#x27; elevation, their daughter Elizabeth married Scroop Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater. This was followed in the summer by an engagement between Mary and John Montagu, heir to the Earl of, and later Duke of Montagu, (they later married on 20 March 1705 (O.S.)). Their two older daughters were already married: Henrietta to Godolphin&#x27;s son Francis in April 1698, and Anne to the hot-headed and intemperate Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland in 1700. However, Marlborough&#x27;s hopes of founding a great dynasty of his own reposed in his eldest and only surviving son, John, who, since his father&#x27;s elevation, had borne the courtesy title of Marquess of Blandford. But while studying at Cambridge in early 1703, the 17-year-old was stricken with severe smallpox. His parents rushed to be by his side, but on Saturday morning, 20 February (O.S.), the boy died, plunging the duke into &quot;the greatest sorrow in the world&quot;.

Bearing his grief, and leaving Sarah to hers, the Duke returned to The Hague at the beginning of March. By now Marshal Villeroi had replaced Boufflers as commander in the Spanish Netherlands, but although Marlborough was able to take Bonn, Huy, and Limbourg in 1703, the &quot;Great Design&quot; – the Anglo-Dutch plan to secure Antwerp and thereby open the river lines into Flanders and Brabant – was left in ruins by Villeroi&#x27;s initiative and poor Allied co-ordination, resulting in the near-disaster at the Battle of Ekeren on 30 June. Domestically the Duke also encountered problems. The moderate Tory ministry of Marlborough, the Lord Treasurer Godolphin, and the Speaker of the House of Commons Robert Harley, were hampered by, and often at variance with, their High Tory colleagues whose strategic policy favoured the full employment of the Royal Navy in pursuit of trade advantages and colonial expansion overseas. To the Tories an action at sea was preferable to one ashore: rather than attack the enemy where they were strongest the Tories proposed to attack Louis XIV and Philip V where they were weakest – in their colonial empires and on the high seas. In contrast, the Whigs, led by their Junto, enthusiastically supported the Ministry&#x27;s Continental strategy of thrusting the army into the heart of France. This support wilted somewhat following the Allies&#x27; recent campaign, but the Duke, whose diplomatic tact had held together a very discordant Grand Alliance, was now a general of international repute, and the limited success of 1703 was soon eclipsed by the Blenheim campaign.

====Blenheim and Ramillies====
Pressed by the French and Bavarians to the west and Hungarian rebels to the east, Austria faced the real possibility of being forced out of the war. Concerns over Vienna and the situation in southern Germany convinced Marlborough of the necessity of sending aid to the Danube, but the scheme of seizing the initiative from the enemy was extremely bold. From the start, the Duke resolved to mislead the States General, who would never willingly permit any major weakening of Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands. To this end, Marlborough moved English and Dutch troops to the Moselle (a plan approved of by The Hague), but once there he planned to slip the Dutch leash and march south to link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany. Dutch Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius was likely secretly informed by Marlborough of his plan beforehand.

A combination of strategic deception and brilliant administration enabled Marlborough to achieve his purpose. After marching from the Low Countries, the Allies fought a series of engagements against the Franco-Bavarian forces ranged against them on the Danube. The first major encounter occurred on 2 July 1704 when Marlborough and Prince Louis of Baden stormed the Schellenberg heights at Donauwörth. However, the main event followed on 13 August when Marlborough – assisted by the Imperial commander, the able Prince Eugene of Savoy – delivered a crushing defeat on Marshal Tallard&#x27;s and the Elector of Bavaria&#x27;s army at the Battle of Blenheim. The whole campaign, which historian John A. Lynn describes as one of the greatest examples of marching and fighting before Napoleon, had been a model of planning, logistics, tactical and operational skill, the successful outcome of which had altered the course of the conflict – Bavaria was knocked out of the war, and Louis XIV&#x27;s hopes of an early victory were destroyed. With the subsequent fall of Landau on the Rhine, and Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle, Marlborough now stood as the foremost soldier of the age. Even the Tories, who had declared that should he fail they would &quot;break him up like hounds on a hare&quot;, could not entirely restrain their patriotic admiration.

The Queen lavished upon her favourite the royal manor of Woodstock and the promise of a fine palace commemorative of his great victory at Blenheim; but since her accession her relationship with Sarah had become progressively distant. The Duke and Duchess had risen to greatness not least because of their intimacy with Anne, but the Duchess&#x27;s relentless campaign against the Tories (Sarah was a firm Whig) isolated her from the Queen whose natural inclinations lay with the Tories, the staunch supporters of the Church of England. For her part, Anne, now Queen and no longer the timid adolescent so easily dominated by her more beautiful friend, had grown tired of Sarah&#x27;s tactless political hectoring and increasingly haughty manner which, in the coming years, were to destroy their friendship and undermine the position of her husband.

During the Duke&#x27;s march to the Danube Emperor Leopold I offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the campaign of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle Valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, indecision and Dutch objections (concerned as they were for the security of their homeland), prevented the Duke from attacking the French at the Dyle. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a chance occurrence and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.

The early months of 1706 also proved frustrating for the Duke as Louis XIV&#x27;s generals gained early successes in Italy and Alsace. These setbacks thwarted Marlborough&#x27;s original plans for the coming campaign, but he soon adjusted his schemes and marched into enemy territory. Louis XIV, equally determined to fight and avenge Blenheim, goaded his commander, Marshal Villeroi, to seek out &quot;Monsieur Marlbrouck&quot;. The subsequent Battle of Ramillies, fought in the Spanish Netherlands on 23 May, was perhaps Marlborough&#x27;s most successful action, and one in which he had himself characteristically drawn his sword at the pivotal moment. For the loss of fewer than 5,000 dead and wounded (far fewer than Blenheim), his victory had cost the enemy some 15,000 casualties, inflicting in the words of Marshal Villars, &quot;the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs&quot;. The campaign was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general. Town after town subsequently fell to the Allies. &quot;It really looks more like a dream than truth&quot;, wrote Marlborough to Sarah.

====Falling out of favour====

While Marlborough fought in the Low Countries, a series of personal and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting the government in the next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough&#x27;s son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah&#x27;s tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah&#x27;s cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who was convinced that the duumvirate&#x27;s policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as an alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.

Following his victory at Ramillies, Marlborough returned to England and the acclamation of Parliament; his titles and estates were made perpetual upon his heirs, male or female, so &quot;the memory of these deeds should never lack one of his name to bear it&quot;. However, the Allied successes were followed in 1707 with a resurgence in French arms on all fronts of the war, and a return to political squabbling and indecision within the Grand Alliance. The Great Northern War also threatened dire consequences. The French had hoped to entice King Charles XII of Sweden to attack the Empire regarding grievances over the Polish Succession. In a pre-campaign visit to the King&#x27;s headquarters at Altranstädt, Marlborough&#x27;s diplomacy helped placate Charles and prevent his interference regarding the Spanish Succession. Following the 1706 Treaty of Altranstädt, Tsar Peter the Great of Russia unsuccessfully offered the yet to be conquered Polish crown to Marlborough, among other candidates.

In Altranstädt, Marlborough reportedly approached Carl Piper, the most favoured of the King&#x27;s advisers. Allegedly, he offered Piper a pension in exchange for advising Charles XII to launch an invasion of Russia, as this would distract Charles from interfering in the War of the Spanish Succession. Carl Piper was accused of having accepted Marlborough&#x27;s bribe, advising Charles to invade Russia. Carl Piper denied having accepted Marlborough&#x27;s offer, but he did admit that Marlborough provided his wife, Christina Piper with a pair of valuable earrings which she accepted, and it was the habit of Carl to personally refuse bribes but allow his wife to accept them and then follow her advice.

Nevertheless, major setbacks in Spain at Almansa and along the Rhine in Southern Germany, had caused Marlborough great anxiety. Prince Eugene&#x27;s retreat from Toulon (Marlborough&#x27;s major goal for 1707) ended any lingering hopes of a war-winning blow that year.

Marlborough returned from these tribulations to a political storm as the Ministry&#x27;s critics turned to attack the overall conduct of the war. The Duke and Godolphin had initially agreed to explore a &quot;moderate scheme&quot; with Harley and reconstruct the government, but they were incensed when Harley privately criticised the management of the war in Spain to the Queen, and his associate Henry St John, the Secretary at War, raised the issue in Parliament. Convinced of Harley&#x27;s caballing, the duumvirs threatened the Queen with resignation unless she dismissed him. Anne fought stubbornly to keep her favourite minister, but when the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Pembroke refused to act without &quot;the General nor the Treasurer&quot;, Harley resigned: Henry Boyle replaced him as Secretary of State, and his fellow Whig, Robert Walpole, replaced St John as Secretary at War. The struggle had given Marlborough a final lease of power but it was a Whig victory, and he had to a large extent lost his hold on the Queen.

====Oudenaarde and Malplaquet====

The military setbacks of 1707 continued through the opening months of 1708, with the defection of Bruges and Ghent to the French. Marlborough remained despondent about the general situation, but his optimism received a major boost with the arrival in theatre of Prince Eugene, his co-commander at Blenheim. Heartened by the Prince&#x27;s robust confidence, Marlborough set about to regain the strategic initiative. After a forced march, the Allies crossed the river Schelde at Oudenaarde just as the French army, under Marshal Vendôme and the duc de Burgundy, was crossing farther north with the intent of besieging the place. Marlborough – with renewed self-assurance – moved decisively to engage them. His subsequent victory at the Battle of Oudenaarde on 11 July 1708 demoralised the French army in Flanders; his eye for ground, his sense of timing and his keen knowledge of the enemy were again amply demonstrated. The success, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders, restored the strategic initiative to the Allies, who now opted to besiege Lille, the strongest fortress in Europe. While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town, which surrendered on 22 October; however, it was not until 10 December that the resolute Boufflers yielded the citadel. Yet for all the difficulties of the winter siege, the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success, requiring superior logistical skill and organisation. The Allies re-took Brugge and Gent, and the French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands.

While Marlborough achieved honours on the battlefield, the Whigs, now in the ascendancy, drove the remaining Tories from the Cabinet. Marlborough and Godolphin, now distanced from Anne, would henceforth have to conform to the decisions of a Whig ministry, while the Tories, sullen and vengeful, looked forward to their former leaders&#x27; downfall. To compound his troubles, the Duchess, spurred on by her hatred of Harley and Abigail, had finally driven the Queen to distraction and wrecked what was left of their friendship. Sarah was retained in her court position out of necessity, as the price to be paid to keep her victorious husband at the head of the army.

After the recent defeats and one of the worst winters in modern history, France was on the brink of collapse. However, Allied demands at the peace talks in The Hague in April 1709 (principally concerning Article 37 that bound Louis XIV to hand over Spain within two months or face the renewal of the war), were rejected by the French in June. The Whigs, the Dutch, Marlborough and Eugene failed for personal and political reasons to secure a favourable peace, adhering to the uncompromising slogan &quot;No peace without Spain&quot; without any clear knowledge of how to accomplish it. All the while Harley, maintained up the backstairs by Abigail, rallied the moderates to his side, ready to play an ambitious and powerful middle part.

Marlborough returned to campaigning in the Low Countries in June 1709. After outwitting Marshal Villars to take the town of Tournai on 3 September (a major and bloody operation), the Allies turned their attention upon Mons, determined to maintain the ceaseless pressure on the French. With direct orders from the increasingly desperate Louis XIV to save the city, Villars advanced on the tiny village of Malplaquet on 9 September 1709 and entrenched his position. Two days later the opposing forces clashed in battle. On the Allied left flank the Prince of Orange led Dutch troops in desperate charges only to have them be cut to pieces. On the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely. Nevertheless, sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, enabling Marlborough to break through and claim victory. Yet the cost was high: the allied casualty figures were approximately double that of the enemy (sources vary), leading Marlborough to admit – &quot;The French have defended themselves better in this action than in any battle I&#x27;ve seen&quot;. A rumour among the French about Marlborough&#x27;s death in this battle lead to the burlesque lament &quot;Marlbrough s&#x27;en va-t-en guerre&quot;, (Marlborough has left for the war). The Duke proceeded to take Mons on 20 October, but on his return to England his enemies used the Malplaquet casualty figures to sully his reputation. Harley, now master of the Tory party, did all he could to persuade his colleagues that the pro-war Whigs – and by their apparent concord with Whig policy, Marlborough and Godolphin – were bent on leading the country to ruin.

===Endgame===

The Allies had confidently expected that victory in a major set-piece battle would compel Louis XIV to accept peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat for a compromise peace settlement to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again Louis XIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, Philip V, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.

Although the Duke was only an observer at Geertruidenberg, the failed negotiations gave credence to his detractors that he was deliberately prolonging the war for his own profit. Yet it was with reluctance that he returned to campaigning in the spring, capturing Douai in June, before taking Béthune, and Saint-Venant, followed in November by Aire-sur-la-Lys. Nevertheless, support for the pro-war policy of the Whigs had, by this time, ebbed away. The Cabinet had long lacked cohesion and mutual trust (particularly following the Sacheverell affair) when in the summer the plan to break it up, prepared by Harley, was brought into action by the Queen. Sunderland was dismissed in June, followed by Godolphin (who had refused to sever his ties with Sarah) in August. Others followed. The result of the general election in October was a Tory landslide and a victory for the peace policy. Marlborough remained at the head of the army, however. The defeated Junto, the Dutch, Eugene, and the Emperor, implored him to stand by the common cause, while the new ministers, knowing they had to fight another campaign, required him to maintain the pressure on the enemy until they had made their own arrangements for the peace.

The Duke, &quot;much thinner and greatly altered&quot;, returned to England in November. His relationship with Anne had suffered further setbacks in recent months (she had refused to grant him his requested appointment of Captain-General for life, and had interfered in military appointments). The damage done to Marlborough&#x27;s general standing was substantial because it was so visible. For now, though, the central issue was the Duchess whose growing resentment of Harley and Abigail had finally persuaded the Queen to be rid of her. Marlborough visited Anne on 17 January 1711 (O.S.) in a last attempt to save his wife, but she was not to be swayed, and demanded Sarah give up her Gold Key (the symbol of her office) within two days, warning, &quot;I will talk of no other business till I have the key.&quot;

Notwithstanding all this turmoil – and his declining health – Marlborough returned to The Hague in late February to prepare for what was to be his last campaign, and one of his greatest. Once again Marlborough and Villars formed against each other in line of battle, this time along the Avesnes-le-Comte–Arras sector of the Lines of &quot;Ne Plus Ultra&quot;. Expecting another onslaught on the scale of Malplaquet, the allied generals surmised that their commander, distressed from domestic turmoil, was leading them to an appalling slaughter. By an exercise of brilliant psychological deception, and a secretive night march covering nearly 40 miles in 18 hours, the Allies penetrated the allegedly impregnable lines without losing a single man; Marlborough was now in position to besiege the fortress of Bouchain. Villars, deceived and outmanoeuvred, was helpless to intervene, compelling the fortress&#x27;s unconditional surrender on 12 September. Chandler writes: The pure military artistry with which he repeatedly deceived Villars during the first part of the campaign has few equals in the annals of military history ... the subsequent siege of Bouchain with all its technical complexities, was an equally fine demonstration of martial superiority.

Marlborough&#x27;s strategic gains in 1711 made it virtually certain that the Allies would march on Paris the following year, but Harley had no intention of letting the war progress that far and risk jeopardising the favourable terms secured from the secret Anglo-French talks (based on the idea that Philip V would remain on the Spanish throne) that had proceeded throughout the year. Marlborough had long had doubts about the Whig policy of &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot;, but he was reluctant to abandon his allies (including the Elector of Hanover, Anne&#x27;s heir presumptive), and sided with the Whigs in opposing the peace preliminaries. Personal entreaties from the Queen (who had long tired of the war), failed to persuade the Duke. The Elector made it clear that he too was against the proposals, and publicly sided with the Whigs. Nevertheless, Anne remained resolute, and on 7 December 1711 (O.S.) she was able to announce that – &quot;notwithstanding those who delight in the arts of war&quot; – a sneer towards Marlborough – &quot;both time and place are appointed for opening the treaty of a general peace&quot;.

===Dismissal===
To prevent the serious renewal of warfare in the spring, it was considered essential to replace Marlborough with a general more in touch with the Queen&#x27;s ministers and less in touch with their allies. To do this, Harley (newly created Earl of Oxford) and St John first needed to bring charges of corruption against the Duke, completing the anti-Whig, anti-war picture that Jonathan Swift was already presenting to a credulous public through his pamphleteering, notably in his &quot;Conduct of the Allies&quot; (1711).

Two main charges were brought to the House of Commons against Marlborough: first, an assertion that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that he had taken 2.5% from the pay of the foreign troops in English pay, amounting to £280,000. Despite Marlborough&#x27;s refutations (claiming ancient precedent for the first allegation, and, for the second, producing a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deductions instead of secret service money for the war), the findings were enough for Harley to persuade the Queen to release her Captain-General. On 29 December 1711 (O.S.), before the charges had been examined, Anne, who owed to him the success and glory of her reign, sent her letter of dismissal: &quot;I am sorry for your own sake the reasons have become so public which makes it necessary for me to let you know you have rendered it impracticable for you to continue yet longer in my service&quot;. The Tory-dominated Parliament concluded by a substantial majority that &quot;the taking of several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough from the contractor for foraging the bread and wagons ... was unwarrantable and illegal&quot;, and that the 2.5% deducted from the pay of foreign troops &quot;is public money and ought to be accounted for&quot;. When his successor, the Duke of Ormonde, left London for The Hague to take command of British forces he went, noted Bishop Burnet, with &quot;the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of Marlborough&quot;.

The Allies were stunned by Marlborough&#x27;s dismissal. The French, however, rejoiced at the removal of the main obstacle to the Anglo-French talks. Oxford (i.e. Harley) and St John had no intention of letting Britain&#x27;s new Captain-General undertake any action, and issued Ormonde his &quot;restraining orders&quot; in May, forbidding him to use British troops in action against the French – an infamous step that ultimately ruined Eugene&#x27;s campaign in Flanders. Marlborough continued to make his views known, but he was in trouble: attacked by his enemies and the government press; with his fortune in peril and Blenheim Palace still unfinished and running out of money; and with England split between Hanoverian and Jacobite factions, Marlborough thought it wise to leave the country. After attending Godolphin&#x27;s funeral on 7 October (O.S.), he went into voluntary exile to the Continent on 1 December 1712 (O.S.).

== Later life ==
===Return to favour===

Marlborough was welcomed and fêted by the people and courts of Europe, where he was not only respected as a great general but also as a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. Sarah joined him in February 1713 and was delighted when on reaching Frankfurt in the middle of May to see that the troops under Eugene&#x27;s command paid her lord &quot;all the respects as if he had been at his old post&quot;. Churchill was described as having been about the middle height, and has the best figure in the world; his features are without fault, fine, sparkling eyes and good teeth ... In short, apart from his legs, which are too thin, he is one of the handsomest men ever seen ... His ambition knows no bounds.

Throughout his travels Marlborough remained in close contact with the Electoral court of Hanover, determined to ensure a bloodless Hanoverian succession on Anne&#x27;s death. He also maintained correspondence with the Jacobites. The spirit of the age saw little wrong in Marlborough&#x27;s continuing friendship with his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, James II&#x27;s illegitimate son with Arabella. But these assurances against a Jacobite restoration (which he had been taking out since the early years of William III, no matter how insincere), stirred Hanoverian suspicions, and perhaps prevented him from holding the first place in the counsels of the future George I.

The representatives of France, Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Utrecht on 11 April 1713 (N.S.) – the Emperor and his German allies, including the Elector of Hanover, continued with the war before finally accepting the general settlement the following year. The Treaty marked Britain&#x27;s emergence as a great power. Domestically, however, the country remained divided between Whig and Tory, Jacobite and Hanoverian factions. By now Oxford and St John (Viscount Bolingbroke since 1712) – absorbed entirely by their mutual enmity and political squabbling – had effectively wrecked the Tory administration. Marlborough had been kept well informed of events while in exile and had remained a powerful figure on the political scene, not least because of the personal attachment the Queen still retained for him. After the death of his daughter Elizabeth from smallpox in March 1714, Marlborough contacted the Queen. Although the contents of the letter are unknown, Anne may likely have summoned him home. Either way, it seems that an agreement was reached to reinstate the Duke in his former offices.

Oxford&#x27;s period of predominance was now at an end, and Anne turned to Bolingbroke and Marlborough to assume the reins of government and ensure a smooth succession. But beneath the weight of hostility the Queen&#x27;s health, already fragile, rapidly deteriorated, and on 1 August 1714 (O.S.) – the day the Marlboroughs returned to England – she died. The Privy Council immediately proclaimed the Elector of Hanover King George I of Great Britain. The Jacobites had proved incapable of action; what Daniel Defoe called the &quot;solidity of the constitution&quot; had triumphed, and the regents chosen by George prepared for his arrival.

=== Death ===
The Duke&#x27;s return to favour under the House of Hanover enabled him to preside over the defeat of the 1715 Jacobite rising from London (although it was his former assistant, Cadogan, who directed the operations). But his health was fading, and on 28 May 1716 (O.S.), shortly after the death of his daughter Anne, Countess of Sunderland, he suffered a paralytic stroke at Holywell House. This was followed by another, more serious stroke in November, this time at a house on the Blenheim estate. The Duke recovered somewhat, his speech had become slightly impaired, but it was not severe and continued to improve over time and his mind remained as sharp and clear as ever. He recovered enough to ride out to watch the builders at work on Blenheim Palace and attend the Lords to vote for Oxford&#x27;s impeachment.

In 1719 the Duke and Duchess were able to move into the east wing of the unfinished palace, but Marlborough had only three years to enjoy it. While living at Windsor Lodge he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday and slipped into a coma. Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried on 9 August (O.S.) in the vault at the east end of the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved to be by her side lying in the vault beneath the chapel at Blenheim. One newspaper described how the occasion was &quot;celebrated with unparallel&#x27;d Magnificence&quot;, a fitting end for &quot;he, who surpass&#x27;d all the Heroes of Antiquity&quot;.

=== Assessment ===
Historian John H. Lavalle argues that:
Marlborough&#x27;s place as one of the finest soldiers Britain ever produced is well deserved. He possessed the personal courage, imagination, common sense, self-control, and quick wits that mark the best battlefield commanders. He had an unerring ability to sense an enemy&#x27;s weaknesses and the ability to use stratagems to throw his enemy off balance... It was in the realm of strategy, however, where Marlborough shone. As commander-in-chief of a coalition army, he could tolerate politicians, allies, and fools gladly. He also saw the potential of the recently introduced combination of flintlock and socket bayonet to restore the offensive...to warfare in an age when extensive fortifications, magazines, and the defensive dominated military thinking. Marlborough&#x27;s attention to logistics allowed him to break free of the bonds of the magazine system and ensured that his soldiers were fed, clothed, and paid, earning him the loyalty of his troops and the nickname &quot;Corporal John&quot;.

Marlborough was equally adept at both battle and siege. Robert Parker, who served under Marlborough, writes:
in the ten campaigns he made against [the French]; during all which time it cannot be said that he ever slipped an opportunity of fighting when there was any probability of coming at his enemy: and upon all occasions he concerted matters with so much judgment and forecast, that he never fought a battle which he did not gain, nor laid siege to a town which he did not take.

Sicco van Goslinga, a Dutch field deputy who worked closely with Marlborough, frequently praised his military abilities and considered him a genius, but gave a mixed view of Marlborough&#x27;s personal character. In Van Goslinga&#x27;s opinion, Marlborough often faked his sincerity along with being overly ambitious and greedy. He also wrote that 

He [Marlborough] was sometimes indecisive, especially on the eve of some great undertaking, shrank from difficulties, and sometimes allowed himself to be beaten down by adversity... He knows little about military discipline and gives too much freedom to the soldiers, causing them to commit horrible excesses.

To military historians David Chandler and Richard Holmes, Marlborough is the greatest British commander in history, an assessment that is shared by others, including the Duke of Wellington who could &quot;conceive nothing greater than Marlborough at the head of an English army&quot;. However the 19th century Whig historian Thomas Macaulay denigrated Marlborough throughout the pages of his &quot;History of England&quot;. In the words of historian John Wilson Croker he pursued the Duke with &quot;more than the ferocity, and much less than the sagacity, of a bloodhound&quot;, though according to G. M. Trevelyan Macaulay &quot;instinctively desired to make Marlborough&#x27;s genius stand out bright against the background of his villainy&quot;. It was largely in response to Macaulay that a descendant, Winston Churchill, wrote his laudatory biography, &quot;&quot; (4 vol. 1933–1938).

Unlike Macaulay, the 19th-century Dutch military historian Willem Jan Knoop criticised not only Marlborough’s character but also his generalship. In Knoop&#x27;s view, Marlborough was hardly comparable to Wellington, and his successes were largely owed to the quality of his Dutch troops, skilled subordinates, cooperation with Prince Eugene, and the ineptitude of his opponents. While less harsh, the modern American historian Cathal Nolan echoed Knoop&#x27;s assessment, stating: The main reasons for his successes were Britain’s rising military power, critical Dutch and English finance, very fine Dutch and British troops, many able subordinates, and an equally talented co-commander in Prince Eugene of Savoy.

Marlborough was ruthlessly ambitious, and relentless in the pursuit of wealth, power, and social advancement, earning him a reputation for avarice and miserliness. These traits may have been exaggerated for party faction but, notes Trevelyan, nearly all other statesmen of the day were engaged in founding families and amassing estates at the public expense; Marlborough only differed in that he gave the public much more value for their money. In his quest for fame and personal interests he could be unscrupulous, as his desertion of James II testifies. To Macaulay this is regarded as a piece of selfish treachery against his patron; an analysis shared by G. K. Chesterton, a devout Catholic: Churchill, as if to add something ideal to his imitation of Iscariot, went to James with wanton professions of love and loyalty ... and then calmly handed over the army to the invader. To the finish of this work of art but few could aspire, but to their degree, all the politicians of the Revolution were upon this ethical pattern. To Trevelyan, Marlborough&#x27;s behaviour during the 1688 revolution was a sign of his &quot;devotion to the liberties of England and the Protestant religion&quot;. However, his continuing correspondence with Saint-Germain was not noble. Although Marlborough did not wish for a Jacobite restoration his double-dealing ensured that William III and George I would never be fully disposed to trust him.

Marlborough&#x27;s weakness during Anne&#x27;s reign lay in the English political scene. His determination to preserve the independence of the Queen&#x27;s administration from the control of the party faction initially enjoyed full support, but once royal favour turned elsewhere, the Duke, like his key ally Godolphin, found himself isolated; first becoming little more than a servant of the Whigs, then a victim of the Tories.

===Captain-General===
On the grand strategic level, Marlborough had a rare grasp of the broad issues involved and was able from the start of the War of the Spanish Succession to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of Philip V as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war&#x27;s main theatre. The Allies did come close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon Louis XIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.

As a commander, Marlborough preferred battle over slow-moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected &quot;aides-de-camp&quot; such as Cadogan), as well as enjoying a close personal relationship with Eugene of Savoy, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy&#x27;s characteristics in battle. Marlborough was more likely to manoeuvre than his opponents and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet he qualified more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th-century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and coordinated combined arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes. 

Marlborough was also a good administrator and his attention to detail meant that his troops rarely went short of supply. When his armies arrived at their destination they were intact and in a fit state to fight. This was accomplished mostly due to Marlborough&#x27;s fruitful cooperation with Dutch officials and commanders, who frequently made use of the Dutch Republic&#x27;s efficient supply lines on campaign. Marlborough&#x27;s concern for the welfare of the common soldier together with his ability to inspire trust and confidence, and his willingness to share the dangers of battle, often earned him adulation from his men – &quot;The known world could not produce a man of more humanity&quot;, observed Corporal Matthew Bishop. It was this range of abilities that make Marlborough outstanding. Even his old adversaries recognised the Duke&#x27;s qualities. In his &quot;Letters on the Study of History&quot; (1752), Bolingbroke declared, &quot;I take with pleasure this opportunity of doing justice to that great man ... [whose memory] as the greatest general, and as the greatest minister that our country, or perhaps any other has produced, I honour&quot;. His success was made possible because of his enormous reserves of stamina, willpower and self-discipline; his ability to hold together the Alliance against France, made possible by his victories, can hardly be overestimated.

<text>An ace is a playing card, die or domino with a single pip. In the standard French deck, an ace has a single suit symbol (a heart, diamond, spade, or a club) located in the middle of the card, sometimes large and decorated, especially in the case of the ace of spades. This embellishment on the ace of spades started when King James VI of Scotland and I of England required an insignia of the printing house to be printed on the ace of spades. This insignia was necessary for identifying the printing house and stamping it as having paid the new stamp tax. Although this requirement was abolished in 1960, the tradition has been kept by many card makers. In other countries the stamp and embellishments are usually found on ace cards; clubs in France, diamonds in Russia, and hearts in Genoa because they have the most blank space.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;ace&quot; (, ) comes from the Old French word &quot;as&quot; (from Latin &#x27;as&#x27;) meaning &#x27;a unit&#x27;, from the name of a small Roman coin. It originally meant the side of a die with only one pip, before it was a term for a playing card. Since this was the lowest roll of the die, it traditionally meant &#x27;bad luck&#x27; in Middle English, but as the ace is often the highest playing card, its meaning has since changed to mean &#x27;high-quality, excellence&#x27;.

==Ace promotion==
Historically, the ace had a low value and this still holds in many popular European games (in fact many European decks, including the French- and Latin-suited decks, do not use the &quot;A&quot; index, instead keeping the numeral &quot;1&quot;). The modern convention of &quot;ace high&quot;, in which the ace is the highest card of the house, seemed to have happened in stages. Card games, before they arrived in Europe, had suits that were in reverse ranking. In the Chinese game of Mǎ diào, which lacked court cards, the suit of coins was inverted so the 1 of Coins was the highest in its suit. In the Ganjifa games of Persia, India, and Arabia, only the pip cards of half the suits were reversed so the 1 ranked just below the lowest court card. This convention carried over to early European games like Ombre, Maw, and Trionfi (Tarot). During the 15th and 16th centuries, the ranking of all suits were becoming progressive. A few games from this period like Triomphe, has the ace between the ten and the jack. The earliest known game in which the ace is the highest card of its suit is Trappola. In ace–ten games like brusquembille, pinochle and sixty-six, the ace dragged the 10 along with it to the top so the ranking became A-10-K. Some games promoted the deuces and treys too like Put, Truc, and Tressette. &quot;King high&quot; games were still being made in the 17th century, for example cribbage. Many games, such as poker and blackjack, allow the player to choose whether the ace is used as a high or low card. This duality allows players in some other games to use it as both at once; some variants of Rummy allow players to form melds, of rank K-A-2 or similar. This is known as &quot;going around the corner&quot;.

It was not only the French deck which experienced this promotion, but some games involving the Swiss and German deck also evolved into using the &quot;Daus&quot; (deuce) as the highest card. The ace had disappeared during the 15th century, so the deuce took its place. The &quot;Ass&quot; (ace) and &quot;Daus&quot; (deuce) were conflated into a single card and the names are used interchangeably along with &quot;Sau&quot; (sow) as early cards of that rank depicted a pig. Some decks in southern Germany use &quot;A&quot; for the index because &quot;D&quot; is reserved for &quot;Dame&quot; (Queen) in French-suited decks. Confusion is also avoided as German-suited decks lack numbered cards below &quot;7&quot; or &quot;6&quot;. Despite using French-suited cards, Russians call the Ace a Deuce (&quot;tuz&quot;), a vestige of a period when German cards were predominant in central and eastern Europe.

<doc id="142294" wikidata="Q208181" url="?curid=142294" title="Blenheim Palace">
<text>Blenheim Palace ( ) is a country house in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England. It is the seat of the Dukes of Marlborough. Originally called Blenheim Castle, it has been known as Blenheim Palace since the 19th century. One of England&#x27;s largest houses, it was built between 1705 and 1722, and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.

The palace is named after the 1704 Battle of Blenheim. It was originally intended to be a reward to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough for his military triumphs against the French and Bavarians in the War of the Spanish Succession, culminating in the Battle of Blenheim. The land was given as a gift, and construction began in 1705, with some financial support from Queen Anne. The project soon became the subject of political infighting, with the Crown cancelling further financial support in 1712, Marlborough&#x27;s three-year voluntary exile to the Continent, the fall from influence of his duchess, and lasting damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh.

Designed in the rare, and short-lived, English Baroque style, architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s. It is unique in its combined use as a family home, mausoleum and national monument. The palace is notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill.

Following the palace&#x27;s completion, it became the home of the Churchill (later Spencer-Churchill) family for the next 300 years, and various members of the family have wrought changes to the interiors, park and gardens. At the end of the 19th century, the palace was saved from ruin by funds gained from the 9th Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s marriage to American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt.

==Origins and construction==
=== Churchills ===
John Churchill was born in Devon. Although his family had aristocratic relations, it belonged to the minor gentry rather than the upper echelons of 17th-century society. In 1678, Churchill married Sarah Jennings, and in April that year, he was sent by Charles II to The Hague to negotiate a convention on the deployment of the English army in Flanders. The mission ultimately proved abortive. In May, Churchill was appointed to the temporary rank of Brigadier-General of Foot, but the possibility of a continental campaign was eliminated with the Treaty of Nijmegen.

When Churchill returned to England, the Popish Plot resulted in a temporary three-year banishment for James Stuart, Duke of York. The Duke obliged Churchill to attend him, first to The Hague, then in Brussels. For his services during the crisis, Churchill was made Lord Churchill of Eyemouth in the peerage of Scotland in 1682, and the following year appointed colonel of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons.

On the death of Charles II in 1685, his brother, the Duke of York, became King James II. James had been Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (today North America&#x27;s oldest company, established by royal charter in 1670), and with his succession to the throne, Churchill was appointed the company&#x27;s third ever governor. He had also been affirmed Gentleman of the Bedchamber in April, and admitted to the English peerage as Baron Churchill of Sandridge in the county of Hertfordshire in May. Following the Monmouth Rebellion, Churchill was promoted to Major General and awarded the lucrative colonelcy of the Third Troop of Life Guards.

When William, Prince of Orange, invaded England in November 1688, Churchill, accompanied by some 400 officers and men, rode to join him in Axminster. When the King saw he could not even keep Churchill – for so long his loyal and intimate servant – he fled to France. As part of William III&#x27;s coronation honours, Churchill was created Earl of Marlborough, sworn to the Privy Council, and made a Gentleman of the King&#x27;s Bedchamber.

During the War of the Spanish Succession Churchill gained a reputation as a capable military commander, and in 1702 he was elevated to the dukedom of Marlborough. During the war he won a series of victories, including the Battle of Blenheim (1704), the Battle of Ramillies (1706), the Battle of Oudenarde (1708), and the Battle of Malplaquet (1709). For his victory at Blenheim, the Crown bestowed upon Marlborough the tenancy of the royal manor of Hensington (situated on the site of Woodstock) to site the new palace, and Parliament voted a substantial sum of money towards its creation. The rent or &quot;petit serjeanty&quot; due to the Crown for the land was set at the peppercorn rent or quit-rent of one copy of the French royal flag to be tendered to the Monarch annually on the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim. This flag is displayed by the Monarch on a 17th-century French writing table in Windsor Castle.

Marlborough&#x27;s wife was by all accounts a cantankerous woman, though capable of great charm. She had befriended the young Princess Anne and later, when the princess became Queen, the Duchess of Marlborough, as Her Majesty&#x27;s Mistress of the Robes, exerted great influence over the Queen on both personal and political levels. The relationship between Queen and Duchess later became strained and fraught, and following their final quarrel in 1711, the money for the construction of Blenheim ceased. For political reasons the Marlboroughs went into exile on the Continent until they returned the day after the Queen&#x27;s death on 1 August 1714.

=== Site ===
The estate given by the nation to Marlborough for the new house was the manor of Woodstock, sometimes called the Palace of Woodstock, which had been a royal demesne, in reality little more than a deer park. Legend has obscured the manor&#x27;s origins. King Henry I enclosed the park to contain the deer. Henry II housed his mistress Rosamund Clifford (sometimes known as &quot;Fair Rosamund&quot;) there in a &quot;bower and labyrinth&quot;; a spring in which she is said to have bathed remains, named after her.

It seems the unostentatious hunting lodge was rebuilt many times, and had an uneventful history until Elizabeth I, before her succession, was imprisoned there by her half-sister Mary I between 1554 and 1555. Elizabeth had been implicated in the Wyatt plot, but her imprisonment at Woodstock was short, and the manor remained in obscurity until bombarded and ruined by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops during the Civil War.

When the park was being re-landscaped as a setting for the house, the 1st Duchess wanted the historic ruins demolished, while Vanbrugh, an early conservationist, wanted them restored and made into a landscape feature. The Duchess, as so often in her disputes with her architect, won the day and the remains of the manor were swept away.

=== Architect ===

The architect selected for the ambitious project was a controversial one. The Duchess was known to favour Sir Christopher Wren, famous for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and many other national buildings. The Duke however, following a chance meeting at a playhouse, is said to have commissioned Sir John Vanbrugh there and then. Vanbrugh, a popular dramatist, was an untrained architect, who usually worked in conjunction with the trained and practical Nicholas Hawksmoor. The duo had recently completed the first stages of the Baroque Castle Howard. This huge Yorkshire mansion was one of England&#x27;s first houses in the flamboyant European Baroque style. The success of Castle Howard led Marlborough to commission something similar at Woodstock.
Blenheim, however, was not to provide Vanbrugh with the architectural plaudits he imagined it would. The fight over funding led to accusations of extravagance and impracticality of design, many of these charges levelled by the Whig factions in power. He found no defender in the Duchess of Marlborough. Having been foiled in her wish to employ Wren, she levelled criticism at Vanbrugh on every level, from design to taste. In part their problems arose from what was demanded of the architect. The nation (which was then assumed, by both architect and owners, to be paying the bills) wanted a monument, but the Duchess wanted not only a fitting tribute to her husband but also a comfortable home, two requirements that were not compatible in 18th-century architecture. Finally, in the early days of the building the Duke was frequently away on his military campaigns, and it was left to the Duchess to negotiate with Vanbrugh. More aware than her husband of the precarious state of the financial aid they were receiving, she criticised Vanbrugh&#x27;s grandiose ideas for their extravagance.

Following their final altercation, Vanbrugh was banned from the site. In 1719, whilst the Duchess was away, Vanbrugh viewed the house in secret. However, when Vanbrugh&#x27;s wife visited the completed Blenheim as a member of the viewing public in 1725, the Duchess refused to allow her even to enter the park.

Vanbrugh&#x27;s severe massed Baroque used at Blenheim never truly caught the public imagination, and was quickly superseded by the revival of the Palladian style. Vanbrugh&#x27;s reputation was irreparably damaged, and he received no further truly great public commissions. For his final design, Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland, which was hailed as his masterpiece, he used a refined version of the Baroque employed at Blenheim. He died shortly before its completion.

=== Funding the construction ===
The precise responsibility for the funding of the new house has always been a debatable subject, unresolved to this day. The house as a reward was mooted within months of the Battle of Blenheim, at a time when Marlborough was still to gain many further victories on behalf of the country. That a grateful nation led by Queen Anne wished and intended to give their national hero a suitable home is beyond doubt, but the exact size and nature of that house is questionable. A warrant dated 1705, signed by the parliamentary treasurer the Earl of Godolphin, appointed Vanbrugh as architect and outlined his remit. Unfortunately for the Churchills, nowhere did this warrant mention Queen or Crown.

The Duke of Marlborough contributed £60,000 to the initial cost when work commenced in 1705, which, supplemented by Parliament, should have built a monumental house. Parliament voted funds for the building of Blenheim, but no exact sum was mentioned nor provision for inflation or over-budget expenses. Almost from the outset, funds were spasmodic. Queen Anne paid some of them, but with growing reluctance and lapses, following her frequent altercations with the Duchess. After their final argument in 1712, all state money ceased and work came to a halt. £220,000 had already been spent and £45,000 was owing to workmen. The Marlboroughs were forced into exile on the continent, and did not return until after the Queen&#x27;s death in 1714.

On their return the Duke and Duchess came back into favour at court. The 64-year-old Duke now decided to complete the project at his own expense. In 1716 work resumed, but the project relied completely upon the limited means of the Duke himself. Harmony on the building site was short-lived, as in 1717 the Duke suffered a severe stroke, and the thrifty Duchess took control. The Duchess blamed Vanbrugh entirely for the growing costs and extravagance of the house, the design of which she had never liked. Following a meeting with the Duchess, Vanbrugh left the building site in a rage, insisting that the new masons, carpenters and craftsmen, brought in by the Duchess, were inferior to those he had employed. The master craftsmen he had patronised, however, such as Grinling Gibbons, refused to work for the lower rates paid by the Marlboroughs. The craftsmen brought in by the Duchess, under the guidance of furniture designer James Moore, and Vanbrugh&#x27;s assistant architect Hawksmoor, completed the work in perfect imitation of the greater masters.
Following the Duke&#x27;s death in 1722, completion of the house and its park became the Duchess&#x27;s driving ambition. Vanbrugh&#x27;s assistant Hawksmoor was recalled and in 1723 designed the &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot;, based on the Arch of Titus, at the entrance to the park from Woodstock. Hawksmoor also completed the interior design of the library, the ceilings of many of the state rooms and other details in numerous other minor rooms, and various outbuildings.

Cutting rates of pay to workmen, and using lower-quality materials in unobtrusive places, the widowed Duchess completed the great house as a tribute to her late husband. The final date of completion is not known, but as late as 1735 the Duchess was haggling with Rysbrack over the cost of Queen Anne&#x27;s statue placed in the library. In 1732 the Duchess wrote &quot;The Chappel is finish&#x27;d and more than half the Tomb there ready to set up&quot;.

== Current design and architecture ==
Vanbrugh planned Blenheim in perspective; that is, to be best viewed from a distance. As the site covers some seven acres (28,000 m2) this is also a necessity.

The plan of the palace&#x27;s principal block (or corps de logis) is a rectangle (&quot;see plan&quot;) pierced by two courtyards; these serve as little more than light wells. Contained behind the southern facade are the principal state apartments; on the east side are the suites of private apartments of the Duke and Duchess, and on the west along the entire length of the &quot;piano nobile&quot; is given a long gallery originally conceived as a picture gallery, but is now the library. The corps de logis is flanked by two further service blocks around square courtyards (&quot;not shown in the plan&quot;). The east court contains the kitchens, laundry, and other domestic offices, the west court adjacent to the chapel the stables and indoor riding school.

The three blocks together form the &quot;Great Court&quot; designed to overpower the visitor arriving at the palace. Pilasters and pillars abound, while from the roofs, themselves resembling those of a small town, great statues in the Renaissance manner of St Peter&#x27;s in Rome gaze down on the visitor below, who is rendered inconsequential. Other assorted statuary in the guise of martial trophies decorate the roofs, most notably Britannia standing atop the entrance pediment in front of two reclining chained French captives sculpted in the style of Michelangelo, and the English lion devouring the French cock, on the lower roofs. Many of these are by such masters as Grinling Gibbons.

In the design of great 18th-century houses comfort and convenience were subservient to magnificence, and this is certainly the case at Blenheim. This magnificence over creature comfort is heightened as the architect&#x27;s brief was to create not only a home but also a national monument to reflect the power and civilisation of the nation. To create this monumental effect, Vanbrugh chose to design in a severe Baroque style, using great masses of stone to imitate strength and create shadow as decoration.

The solid and huge entrance portico on the north front resembles more the entrance to a than a family home. Vanbrugh also liked to employ what he called his &quot;castle air&quot;, which he achieved by placing a low tower at each corner of the central block and crowning the towers with vast belvederes of massed stone, decorated with curious finials (disguising the chimneys). Coincidentally these towers, which hint at the pylons of an Egyptian temple, further add to the heroic pantheonesque atmosphere of the building.

There are two approaches to the palace&#x27;s grand entrance, one from the long straight drive through wrought iron gates directly into the Great Court; the other, equally if not more impressive, betrays Vanbrugh&#x27;s true vision: the palace as a bastion or citadel, the true monument and home to a great warrior. Piercing the windowless, city-like curtain wall of the east court is the great East Gate, a monumental triumphal arch, more Egyptian in design than Roman. An optical illusion was created by tapering its walls to create an impression of even greater height. Confounding those who accuse Vanbrugh of impracticality, this gate is also the palace&#x27;s water tower. Through the arch of the gate one views across the courtyard a second equally massive gate, that beneath the clock tower, through which one glimpses the Great Court.

This view of the Duke as an omnipotent being is also reflected in the interior design of the palace, and indeed its axis to certain features in the park. It was planned that when the Duke dined in state in his place of honour in the great saloon, he would be the climax of a great procession of architectural mass aggrandising him rather like a proscenium. The line of celebration and honour of his victorious life began with the great column of victory surmounted by his statue and detailing his triumphs, and the next point on the great axis, planted with trees in the position of troops, was the epic Roman style bridge. The approach continues through the great portico into the hall, its ceiling painted by James Thornhill with the Duke&#x27;s apotheosis, then on under a great triumphal arch, through the huge marble door-case with the Duke&#x27;s marble effigy above it (bearing the ducal plaudit &quot;Nor could Augustus better calm mankind&quot;), and into the painted saloon, the most highly decorated room in the palace, where the Duke was to have sat enthroned.

The Duke was to have sat with his back to the great 30-tonne marble bust of his vanquished foe Louis XIV, positioned high above the south portico. Here the defeated King was humiliatingly forced to look down on the great parterre and spoils of his conqueror (rather in the same way as severed heads were displayed generations earlier). The Duke did not live long enough to see this majestic tribute realised, and sit enthroned in this architectural vision. The Duke and Duchess moved into their apartments on the eastern side of the palace, but the entirety was not completed until after the Duke&#x27;s death.

The palace has been Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England since August 1957.

===Palace chapel===
The palace chapel, as a consequence of the Duke&#x27;s death, now obtained even greater importance. The design was altered by the Marlboroughs&#x27; friend the Earl of Godolphin, who placed the high altar in defiance of religious convention against the west wall, thus allowing the dominating feature to be the Duke&#x27;s gargantuan tomb and sarcophagus. Commissioned by the Duchess in 1730, it was designed by William Kent, and statues of the Duke and Duchess depicted as Caesar and Caesarina adorn the great sarcophagus. In bas relief at the base of the tomb, the Duchess ordered to be depicted the surrender of Marshal Tallard. However, the theme throughout the palace of honouring the Duke did not reach its apotheosis until the dowager duchess&#x27;s death in 1744. Then, the Duke&#x27;s coffin was returned to Blenheim from its temporary resting place, Westminster Abbey, and husband and wife were interred together and the tomb erected and completed. Now Blenheim had indeed become a pantheon and mausoleum. Successive Dukes and their wives are also interred in the vault beneath the chapel. Other members of family are interred in St. Martin&#x27;s parish churchyard at Bladon, a short distance from the palace.

== Interior ==


The internal layout of the rooms of the central block at Blenheim was defined by the court etiquette of the day. State apartments were designed as an axis of rooms of increasing importance and public use, leading to the chief room. The larger houses, like Blenheim, had two sets of state apartments each mirroring each other. The grandest and most public and important was the central saloon &quot;(&quot;B&quot; in the plan&quot;) which served as the communal state dining room. To either side of the saloon are suites of state apartments, decreasing in importance but increasing in privacy: the first room &quot;(&quot;C&quot;)&quot; would have been an audience chamber for receiving important guests, the next room &quot;(&quot;L&quot;)&quot; a private withdrawing room, the next room &quot;(&quot;M&quot;)&quot; would have been the bedroom of the occupier of the suite, thus the most private. One of the small rooms between the bedroom and the internal courtyard was intended as a dressing room. This arrangement is reflected on the other side of the saloon. The state apartments were intended for use by only the most important guests such as a visiting sovereign. On the left (east) side of the plan on either side of the bow room &quot;(marked &quot;O&quot;)&quot; can be seen a smaller but nearly identical layout of rooms, which were the suites of the Duke and Duchess themselves. Thus, the bow room corresponds exactly to the saloon in terms of its importance to the two smaller suites.

Blenheim Palace was the birthplace of the 1st Duke&#x27;s famous descendant, Winston Churchill, whose life and times are commemorated by a permanent exhibition in the suite of rooms in which he was born &quot;(marked &quot;K&quot; on the plan)&quot;. Blenheim Palace was designed with all its principal and secondary rooms on the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, thus there is no great staircase of state: anyone worthy of such state would have no cause to leave the &quot;piano nobile&quot;. Insofar as Blenheim does have a grand staircase, it is the series of steps in the Great Court which lead to the North Portico. There are staircases of various sizes and grandeur in the central block, but none are designed on the same scale of magnificence as the palace. James Thornhill painted the ceiling of the hall in 1716. It depicts Marlborough kneeling to Britannia and proffering a map of the Battle of Blenheim. The hall is high, and remarkable chiefly for its size and for its stone carvings by Gibbons, yet in spite of its immense size it is merely a vast anteroom to the saloon.

The saloon was also to have been painted by Thornhill, but the Duchess suspected him of overcharging, so the commission was given to Louis Laguerre. This room is an example of three-dimensional painting, or &quot;trompe l&#x27;œil&quot;, &quot;trick-the-eye&quot;, a fashionable painting technique at the time. The Peace Treaty of Utrecht was about to be signed, so all the elements in the painting represent the coming of peace. The domed ceiling is an allegorical representation of Peace: John Churchill is in the chariot, he holds a zigzag thunderbolt of war, and the woman who holds back his arm represents Peace. The walls depict all the nations of the world who have come together peacefully. Laguerre also included a self-portrait placing himself next to Dean Jones, chaplain to the 1st Duke, another enemy of the Duchess, although she tolerated him in the household because he could play a good hand at cards. To the right of the doorway leading into the first stateroom, Laguerre included the French spies, said to have big ears and eyes because they may still be spying. Of the four marble door-cases in the room displaying the Duke&#x27;s crest as a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, only one is by Gibbons, the other three were copied indistinguishably by the Duchess&#x27;s cheaper craftsmen.

The third remarkable room is the long library designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1722–1725, &quot;(H)&quot;, long, which was intended as a picture gallery. The ceiling has saucer domes, which were to have been painted by Thornhill, had the Duchess not upset him. The palace, and in particular this room, was furnished with the many valuable artefacts the Duke had been given, or sequestered as the spoils of war, including a fine art collection. Here in the library, rewriting history in her own indomitable style, the Duchess set up a larger than life statue of Queen Anne, its base recording their friendship.

From the northern end of the library—in which is housed the largest pipe organ in private ownership in Europe, built by England&#x27;s great organ builder Henry Willis &amp; Sons—access is obtained to the raised colonnade which leads to the chapel &quot;(H)&quot;. The chapel is perfectly balanced on the eastern side of the palace by the vaulted kitchen. This symmetrical balancing and equal weight given to both spiritual and physical nourishment would no doubt have appealed to Vanbrugh&#x27;s renowned sense of humour, if not the Duchess&#x27;. The distance of the kitchen from even the private dining room &quot;(&quot;O&quot; on the plan)&quot; was obviously of no consideration, hot food being of less importance than to avoid having to inhale the odour of cooking and proximity of servants.

==Pipe organs==
The Long Library organ was built in 1891 by the famous London firm of Henry Willis &amp; Sons at a cost of £3,669. It replaced a previous organ built in 1888 by Isaac Abbott of Leeds, which was removed to St Swithun&#x27;s church, Hither Green. Originally erected in the central bay, with its back to the water terraces, the Norwich firm of Norman &amp; Beard moved it to the northwestern end of the library in 1902 and made a few tonal additions and, the following year, cleaned it. No further changes were made until 1930, when the Willis firm lowered the pitch to modern concert pitch: a Welte automatic player was added in 1931, with 70 rolls cut by Marcel Dupré, Joseph Bonnet, Alfred Hollins, Edwin Lemare and Harry Goss-Custard also being supplied. This remained in use for some time: the Duke of the time is said to have frequently sat at the organ bench and pretended to play the organ to his guests and they would applaud at the end. This practice is said to have been halted abruptly when the player started before the Duke had reached the organ. This famous instrument is regularly maintained and is played by visiting organists throughout the year, but as of 2013 its condition is declining: a fundraising campaign has been launched for its complete restoration.

The organ in the chapel was built circa 1853 by Robert Postill of York: it is notable as a rare unaltered example of this fine builder&#x27;s work, speaking boldly and clearly into a generous acoustic.

== Park and gardens ==

Blenheim sits in the centre of a large undulating park, a classic example of the English landscape garden movement and style. When Vanbrugh first cast his eyes over it in 1704 he immediately conceived a typically grandiose plan: through the park trickled the small River Glyme, and Vanbrugh envisaged this marshy brook traversed by the &quot;finest bridge in Europe&quot;. Thus, ignoring the second opinion offered by Sir Christopher Wren, the marsh was channelled into three small canal-like streams and across it rose a bridge of huge proportions, so huge it was reported to contain some 30-odd rooms. While the bridge was indeed an amazing wonder, in this setting it appeared incongruous, causing Alexander Pope to comment: &quot;the minnows, as under this vast arch they pass, murmur, &#x27;how like whales we look, thanks to your Grace.&#x27;&quot;

Horace Walpole saw it in 1760, shortly before Capability Brown&#x27;s improvements: &quot;the bridge, like the beggars at the old duchess&#x27;s gate, begs for a drop of water and is refused.&quot; Another of Vanbrugh&#x27;s schemes was the great parterre, nearly half a mile long and as wide as the south front. Also in the park, completed after the 1st Duke&#x27;s death, is the &quot;Column of Victory&quot;. It is high and terminates a great avenue of elms leading to the palace, which were planted in the positions of Marlborough&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Blenheim. Vanbrugh had wanted an obelisk to mark the site of the former royal manor, and the trysts of Henry II which had taken place there, causing the 1st Duchess to remark, &quot;If there were obelisks to bee made of all what our Kings have done of that sort, the countrey would bee stuffed with very odd things&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;). The obelisk was never realised.

Following the 1st Duke&#x27;s death, the Duchess concentrated most of her considerable energies on the completion of the palace itself, and the park remained relatively unchanged until the arrival of Capability Brown in 1764. The 4th Duke employed Brown who immediately began an English landscape garden scheme to naturalise and enhance the landscape, with tree planting and man-made undulations. However, the feature with which he is forever associated is the lake, a huge stretch of water created by damming the River Glyme and ornamented by a series of cascades where the river flows in and out. The lake was narrowed at the point of Vanbrugh&#x27;s grand bridge, but the three small canal-like streams trickling underneath it were completely absorbed by one river-like stretch. Brown&#x27;s great achievement at this point was to actually flood and submerge beneath the water level the lower stories and rooms of the bridge itself, thus reducing its incongruous height and achieving what is regarded by many as the epitome of an English landscape. Brown also grassed over the great parterre and the Great Court. The latter was re-paved by Duchêne in the early 20th century. The 5th Duke was responsible for several other garden follies and novelties.

Sir William Chambers, assisted by John Yenn, was responsible for the small summerhouse known as &quot;The Temple of Diana&quot; down by the lake, where in 1908 Winston Churchill proposed to his future wife.

The extensive landscaped park, woodlands and formal gardens of Blenheim are Grades I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Blenheim Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==History==
=== Failing fortunes ===
On the death of the 1st Duke in 1722, as both his sons were dead, he was succeeded by his daughter Henrietta. This was an unusual succession and required a special Act of Parliament, as only sons can usually succeed to an English dukedom. When Henrietta died, the title passed to Marlborough&#x27;s grandson Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, whose mother was Marlborough&#x27;s second daughter Anne.

The 1st Duke, as a soldier, was not a rich man and what fortune he possessed was mostly used for finishing the palace. In comparison with other British ducal families, the Marlboroughs were not very wealthy. Yet they existed quite comfortably until the time of the 5th Duke of Marlborough (1766–1840), a spendthrift who considerably depleted the family&#x27;s remaining fortune. He was eventually forced to sell other family estates, but Blenheim was safe from him as it was entailed. This did not prevent him from selling the Marlboroughs&#x27; Boccaccio for a mere £875 and his own library in over 4000 lots. On his death in 1840, his profligacy left the estate and family with financial problems.

By the 1870s, the Marlboroughs were in severe financial trouble and in 1875 the 7th Duke sold the &quot;Marriage of Cupid and Psyche&quot;, together with the famed Marlborough gems, at auction for £10,000. However, this was not enough to save the family. In 1880, the 7th Duke was forced to petition Parliament to break the protective entail on the Palace and its contents. This was achieved under the Blenheim Settled Estates Act 1880 and the door was now open for wholesale dispersal of Blenheim and its contents. The first victim was the great Sunderland Library which was sold in 1882, including such volumes as &quot;The Epistles of Horace&quot;, printed at Caen in 1480, and the works of Josephus, printed at Verona in 1648. The 18,000 volumes raised almost £60,000. The sales continued to denude the palace: Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Ansidei Madonna&quot; was sold for £70,000; Van Dyck&#x27;s Equestrian Portrait of Charles I realised £17,500; and finally, the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; of the collection, Peter Paul Rubens&#x27; &quot;Rubens, His Wife Helena Fourment, and Their Son Peter Paul, and Their Son Frans (1633–1678)&quot;, which had been given by the city of Brussels to the 1st Duke in 1704, was also sold, and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

These sums of money, vast by the standards of the day, failed to cover the debts and the maintenance of the great palace remained beyond the Marlboroughs&#x27; resources. These had always been small in relation to their ducal rank and the size of their house. The British agricultural depression, which started in the 1870s, added to the family&#x27;s problems. When the 9th Duke inherited in 1892, the land was generating dwindling income.

=== 9th Duke of Marlborough ===
Charles, 9th Duke of Marlborough (1871–1934) can be credited with saving both the palace and the family. Inheriting the near-bankrupt dukedom in 1892, he was forced to find a quick and drastic solution to the problems. Prevented by the strict social dictates of late 19th-century society from earning money, he was left with one solution: he had to marry into money. In November 1895 he coldly and openly without love married the American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt.

The marriage was celebrated following lengthy negotiations with her divorced parents: her mother, Alva Vanderbilt, was desperate to see her daughter a duchess, and the bride&#x27;s father, William Vanderbilt, paid for the privilege. The final price was $2,500,000 ($ million today) in 50,000 shares of the capital stock of the Beech Creek Railway Company with a minimum 4% dividend guaranteed by the New York Central Railroad Company. The couple were given a further annual income each of $100,000 for life.

The teenage Consuelo had been locked in her room by her mother until she agreed to the marriage. The marriage settlement was actually signed in the vestry of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, New York, immediately after the wedding vows had been made. In the carriage leaving the church, Marlborough told Consuelo he loved another woman, and would never return to America, as he &quot;despised anything that was not British&quot;.

The replenishing of Blenheim began on the honeymoon itself, with the replacement of the Marlborough gems. Tapestries, paintings and furniture were bought in Europe to fill the depleted palace. On their return, the Duke began an exhaustive restoration and redecoration of the palace. The staterooms to the west of the saloon were redecorated with gilt boiseries in imitation of Versailles. Vanbrugh&#x27;s subtle rivalry to Louis XIV&#x27;s great palace was now completely undermined, as the interiors became mere pastiches of those of the greater palace.

While this redecoration may not have been without fault (and the Duke later regretted it), other improvements were better received. Another problem caused by the redecoration was that the state and principal bedrooms were now moved upstairs, thus rendering the staterooms an enfilade of rather similar and meaningless drawing rooms. On the west terrace, the French landscape architect Achille Duchêne was employed to create a water garden. On a second terrace below this were placed two great fountains in the style of Bernini, scaled models of those in the Piazza Navona which had been presented to the 1st Duke.

Blenheim was once again a place of wonder and prestige. However, Consuelo was far from happy; she records many of her problems in her cynical and often less than candid biography &quot;The Glitter and the Gold&quot; (1956). In 1906 she shocked society and left her husband. They divorced in 1921. She married a Frenchman, Jacques Balsan in 1921. She died in 1964, having lived to see her son become Duke of Marlborough. She frequently returned to Blenheim, the house she had hated and yet saved, albeit as the unwilling sacrifice.

After his divorce the Duke married again, to an American former friend of Consuelo, Gladys Deacon, who was of an artistic disposition, and a painting of her eyes remains on the ceiling of the great north portico (&quot;see secondary lead image&quot;). A lower terrace was decorated with sphinxes modelled on Gladys and executed by W. Ward Willis in 1930. Before her marriage, while staying with the Marlboroughs, she caused a diplomatic incident by encouraging the young Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany to form an attachment with her.

The prince had given her an heirloom ring, which the combined diplomatic services of two empires were charged to recover. After her marriage, Gladys was in the habit of dining with the Duke with a revolver by the side of her plate. Tiring of her, the Duke was temporarily forced to close Blenheim, and turn off the utilities to drive her out. They subsequently separated but did not divorce. The Duke died in 1934. His widow died in 1977.

=== 10th Duke of Marlborough ===
The 9th Duke was succeeded by his and Consuelo Vanderbilt&#x27;s eldest son, John, 10th Duke of Marlborough (1897–1972), who married to the Hon. Alexandra Mary Cadogan in 1920. Together they had two sons and three daughters. She died in 1961, and after eleven years as a widower he remarried at the age of 74 to (Frances) Laura Charteris, formerly the wife of the 2nd Viscount Long and the 3rd Earl of Dudley, and granddaughter of the 11th Earl of Wemyss. The marriage was short-lived, however; the Duke died just six weeks later, on 11 March 1972. The bereaved Duchess complained of &quot;the gloom and inhospitality of Blenheim&quot; after his death and soon moved out. In her autobiography, &quot;Laughter from a Cloud&quot; (1980), she referred to Blenheim Palace as &quot;The Dump&quot;. She died in London in 1990.

=== Second World War ===
The coming-out party held for the 17 year-old Lady Sarah Consuelo Spencer-Churchill at Blenheim Palace on 7 July 1939 was considered to be the highlight of the social season, and in hindsight has been styled by some as &quot;the last season ever&quot;. There were over 700 guests, including Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and the young John F. Kennedy, the house and gardens were lit up and visible for miles, and the Ambrose band played in a pavilion as the guests danced on the vast lawn into the early morning. Socialite Henry (Chips) Channon noted in his diary: “I have seen much, travelled far and am accustomed to splendour, but there has never been anything like tonight”.

During the war the 10th Duke welcomed the boys from Malvern College as evacuees. In September 1940, the Security Service (MI5) was allowed to use the palace as its base until the end of the war.

===11th Duke of Marlborough===
John Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough, (13 April 1926 – 16 October 2014) was a British peer. He was the elder son of the 10th Duke of Marlborough and his wife, the Hon. Alexandra Mary Hilda Cadogan. He was known as &quot;Sunny&quot; after his courtesy title of Earl of Sunderland. He was ranked 224th in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; 2004, with an estimated wealth of £185 million.

In 1972, on inheriting the Dukedom of Marlborough, he assumed the management of Blenheim Palace and the Blenheim estate. To fund the maintenance of the house, he opened it to visitors and as a film set, and established a number of businesses, including a garden furniture company and a water bottling plant.

He was also active in a range of organisations, including the Thames and Chilterns Tourist Board and Oxford United Football Club. He served as vice-president of the Witney Conservative Association, the local party of David Cameron. He died in 2014 at the age of 88.

=== The palace today ===
The palace remains the home of the Dukes of Marlborough, the present incumbent of the title being Charles James (Jamie) Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough. Charles James succeeded to the Dukedom upon his father 11th Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s death on 16 October 2014. , the Marlboroughs still have to tender a copy of the French royal flag to the Monarch on the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim as rent for the land that Blenheim Palace stands on.

The palace, park, and gardens are open to the public on payment of an entry fee (maximum , ). Several tourist entertainment attractions separate from the palace are the Formal and Walled Gardens, Marlborough Maze and the Butterfly House. The palace is linked to the Walled Garden by a miniature railway, the Blenheim Park Railway. 

The public have free access to about five miles (8 km) of public rights of way through the Great Park area of the grounds, which are accessible from Old Woodstock and from the Oxfordshire Way, and which are close to the Column of Victory.

Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, the brother of the current Duke, wished to feature a contemporary art programme within the historic setting of the palace where he spent his childhood. He founded Blenheim Art Foundation (BAF), a non-profit organisation, to present large-scale contemporary art exhibitions. BAF launched on 1 October 2014 with the UK&#x27;s largest ever exhibition by Ai Weiwei. The foundation was conceived to give a vast number of people access to innovative contemporary artists working in the context of this historic palace. 

In September 2019, following the opening of Maurizio Cattelan&#x27;s show &quot;Victory is not an option&quot;, the palace was the scene of a robbery when thieves entered the palace at night time and stole an 18-carat golden toilet, valued at £4.8 million, which had been installed by the artist in one of the bathrooms. In April 2024 one of those responsible pleaded guilty to the theft at Oxford Crown Court.

Blenheim Palace is a frequent location for filming. A survey in 2021 noted that Blenheim made 71 appearances in film and television, more than for any other English country house. The site offers a tour of the various filming locations.

In March 2024, it was announced that Blenheim Palace would be the venue for the 4th summit of the European Political Community on 18 July 2024.

<doc id="142296" wikidata="Q654374" url="?curid=142296" title="Battle of Cambrai (1917)">
<text>The Battle of Cambrai (Battle of Cambrai, 1917, First Battle of Cambrai and Schlacht von Cambrai) was a British attack in the First World War, followed by the biggest German counter-attack against the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) since 1914. The town of Cambrai, in the département of Nord, in France, was an important supply centre for the German (known to the British as the Hindenburg Line) and capture of the town and the nearby Bourlon Ridge would threaten the rear of the German line to the north. Major General Henry Tudor, Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), of the 9th (Scottish) Division, advocated the use of new artillery-infantry tactics on his sector of the front. During preparations, J. F. C. Fuller, a staff officer with the Tank Corps, looked for places to use tanks for raids. General Julian Byng, commander of the Third Army, decided to combine both plans. The French and British armies had used tanks en masse earlier in 1917, although to considerably less effect.

After a big British success on the first day, mechanical unreliability, German artillery and infantry defences exposed the frailties of the Mark IV tank. On the second day, only about half of the tanks were operational and British progress was limited. In the &quot;History of the Great War&quot;, the British official historian Wilfrid Miles and modern scholars do not place exclusive credit for the first day on tanks but discuss the concurrent evolution of artillery, infantry and tank methods. Numerous developments since 1915 matured at Cambrai, such as predicted artillery fire, sound ranging, infantry infiltration tactics, infantry-tank co-ordination and close air support. The techniques of industrial warfare continued to develop and played a vital part during the Hundred Days Offensive in 1918, along with replacement of the Mark IV tank with improved types. The rapid reinforcement and defence of Bourlon Ridge by the Germans, as well as their counter-attack, were also notable achievements, which gave the Germans hope that an offensive strategy could end the war before American mobilisation became overwhelming.

==Prelude==

===British plan===

Proposals for an operation in the Cambrai area using a large number of tanks originated from Brigadier Hugh Elles of the Tank Corps, and the reliance on the secret transfer of artillery reinforcements to be &quot;silently registered&quot; to gain surprise came from Henry Hugh Tudor, commander of the 9th (Scottish) infantry division artillery. In August 1917, Tudor conceived the idea of a surprise attack in the IV Corps sector, he suggested a primarily artillery-infantry attack, which would be supported by a small number of tanks, to secure a breakthrough of the German Hindenburg Line. The German defences were formidable; Cambrai, was a quiet front and the Germans had built an elaborate defence in depth.

Tudor&#x27;s plan sought to test new methods in combined arms, with emphasis on joint artillery and infantry tactics to see how effective they were against German fortifications. Tudor advocated using the new sound ranging and silent registration of guns to achieve instant suppression of fire and surprise. He also wanted to use tanks to clear paths through the deep barbed wire obstacles in front of German positions, while supporting the tank force with the No. 106 Fuze, designed to detonate high explosive (HE) ammunition without cratering the ground, to supplement the armour.

===Air support===

Two weeks before the start of the battle, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) began to train its pilots in ground-attack tactics. Before the ground offensive, the RFC was assigned sets of targets to attack, including trenches, supply points and enemy airfields.

==Battle==

===Third Army===

The battle began at dawn, approximately 06:30 on 20 November, with a predicted bombardment by on German defences, followed by smoke and a creeping barrage at ahead to cover the first advances. Despite efforts to preserve secrecy, the Germans had received sufficient intelligence to be on moderate alert: an attack on Havrincourt was anticipated, as was the use of tanks. The attacking force was six infantry divisions of the III Corps (Lieutenant-General Pulteney) on the right and IV Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Woollcombe) on the left, supported by nine battalions of the Tank Corps with about In reserve was one infantry division in IV Corps and the three divisions of the Cavalry Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Kavanagh). Initially, there was considerable success in most areas and it seemed as if a great victory was within reach; the Hindenburg Line had been penetrated with advances of up to . On the right, the 12th (Eastern) Division advanced as far as Lateau Wood before being ordered to dig in. The 20th (Light) Division forced a way through La Vacquerie and then advanced to capture a bridge across the Canal de Saint-Quentin at Masnières. The bridge collapsed under the weight of a tank halting the hopes for an advance across the canal. In the centre the 6th Division captured Ribécourt and Marcoing but when the cavalry passed through late, they were repulsed from Noyelles.
On the IV Corps front, the 51st (Highland) Division (Major-General George Harper) was held at Flesquières, its first objective, which left the attacking divisions on each flank exposed to enfilade fire. Harper had used a local variation of the tank drill instead of the standard one laid down by the Tank Corps. Flesquières was one of the most fortified points in the German line and was flanked by other strong points. Its defenders under Major Krebs acquitted themselves well against the tanks, almost forty being knocked out by the artillery in the vicinity. The Lone gunner of Flesquières (a common explanation of the &quot;mythical&quot; German officer) ignored the fact that the British tanks were opposed by a specialist anti-tank unit benefiting from the experience against French tanks in the Nivelle Offensive. The Germans abandoned Flesquières during the night.
To the west of Flesquières, the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division swept all the way through Havrincourt and Graincourt to within reach of the woods on Bourlon Ridge and on the British left, the 36th Division reached the Bapaume–Cambrai road. Of the tanks, 180 were out of action after the first day, although only been destroyed. Of the other casualties, 71 had suffered mechanical failure and 43 had ditched. The British lost and took a casualty rate half that of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) and a greater advance in six hours than in three months at Flanders but the British had failed to reach Bourlon Ridge. The German command was quick to send reinforcements and was relieved that the British did not manage fully to exploit their early gains. When the battle was renewed on 21 November, the pace of the British advance was greatly slowed. Flesquières, that had been abandoned and Cantaing were captured in the very early morning but in general the British took to consolidating their gains rather than expanding. The attacks by III Corps were terminated and attention was turned to IV Corps.
The effort was aimed at Bourlon Ridge. Fighting was fierce around Bourlon and at Anneux (just before the woods) was costly. German counter-attacks squeezed the British out of Moeuvres on 21 November and Fontaine on 22 November; when Anneux was taken, the 62nd Division found themselves unable to enter Bourlon Wood. The British were left exposed in a salient. Haig still wanted Bourlon Ridge and the exhausted 62nd Division was replaced by the 40th Division (Major-General John Ponsonby) on 23 November. Supported by almost and , the 40th Division attacked into the woods of Bourlon Ridge on the morning of 23 November and made little progress. The Germans had put two divisions of on the ridge with another two in reserve and was reinforced.

The 40th Division attack reached the crest of the ridge but were held there and suffered more than in three days. More British troops were pushed in to move beyond the woods but the British reserves were rapidly depleted and more German reinforcements were arriving. The final British effort was on 27 November by the 62nd Division aided by Early success was soon reversed by a German counter-attack. The British now held a salient roughly with its front along the crest of the ridge. On 28 November, the offensive was stopped and the British troops were ordered to lay wire and dig in. The Germans were quick to concentrate their artillery on the new British positions. On 28 November, more than were fired into the wood.

===German 2nd Army===
As the British took the ridge, German reinforcements began to arrive. By 23 November, the German command felt that a British breakthrough had been prevented and began to consider a counter-stroke and twenty divisions were assembled in the Cambrai area. The Germans planned to retake the Bourlon salient and also to attack around Havrincourt, with diversionary attacks to hold IV Corps; it was hoped to at least reach the old positions on the Hindenburg Line. The Germans intended to employ the new tactics of a short, intense period of shelling followed by a rapid assault using &quot;Hutier&quot; infiltration tactics, leading elements attacking in groups rather than waves and bypassing strong opposition. Three divisions of ( Otto von Moser) were to conduct the initial assault at Bourlon. On the eastern flank of the British salient, was to attack from Bantouzelle to Rumilly to capture Marcoing. advanced from Banteux. The two had seven infantry divisions.

British VII Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Snow), to the south of the threatened area, warned III Corps of German preparations. The German attack began at on 30 November; almost immediately, the majority of III Corps divisions were heavily engaged. The German infantry advance in the south was unexpectedly swift. The commanders of the 12th (Eastern) Division and 29th Division were almost captured, with Brigadier-General Berkeley Vincent having to fight his way out of his headquarters and grab men from retreating units to try to halt the Germans. In the south, the German advance spread across and came within a few miles of the village of Metz and its link to Bourlon.

At Bourlon, the Germans suffered many casualties. British units displayed reckless determination; one group of eight British machine-guns fired over against the German advance. The concentration of British effort to hold the ridge was effective but allowed the German advance elsewhere greater opportunity. Only counter-attacks by the Guards Division, the arrival of British tanks and the fall of night allowed the line to be held. By the following day, the impetus of the German advance was lost but pressure on 3 December led to the German capture of La Vacquerie and a British withdrawal on the east bank of the St Quentin canal. The Germans had reached a line curving from Quentin Ridge to near Marcoing. The German capture of Bonavis ridge made the British hold on Bourlon precarious. On 3 December, Haig ordered a partial retreat from the north salient and by 7 December, the British gains were abandoned except for a portion of the Hindenburg line around Havrincourt, Ribécourt and Flesquières. The Germans had exchanged this territorial loss for a slightly smaller sector to the south of Welsh Ridge.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The success of the first day was greeted in Britain by the ringing of church bells. The massed use of tanks, despite being a further increase on previous deployments, was not new but the success of the attack and the resulting Allied press enthusiasm was unprecedented. The particular effectiveness of the tanks at Cambrai was the initial passage through barbed wire defences, which had been previously &quot;supposed by the Germans to be impregnable&quot;.

The victory showed that even the most elaborate field fortifications could be overcome by a surprise attack, using a combination of new methods and equipment, reflecting a general increase in the British capacity to combine infantry, artillery, tanks and aircraft in attacks. The German revival after the shock of the British advance improved German morale but the potential for similar attacks meant that the Germans had to divert resources to anti-tank defences and weapons, an extra demand that the Germans could ill afford to meet,

The German counter-attack showed the effectiveness of artillery, trench mortars and evolving storm troop tactics, adopted from methods introduced by Hutier and his artillery commander, Colonel Georg Bruchmüller, against the Russians. From the German perspective, questions arose regarding battlefield supply beyond rail heads and the suitability of the MG 08 machine gun for rapid movement. By the end of the battle, the British retained some of the ground captured in the north and the Germans a smaller amount taken in the south. The British conducted several investigations, including a Court of Enquiry.

===Casualties===

According to the Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire during the Great War, the British forces in France, in the period of the Battle of Cambrai suffered or died of wounds, and or prisoners of war. Wilfrid Miles, the official historian, gave British losses in the Third Army, Tank Corps and the RFC from 20 November to 8 December them in the main battle. On the first day, were lost, knocked out, mechanical defects and other causes. the British took guns and howitzers and guns and howitzers, and mortars. The British recorded casualties on the basis of a daily head count and during the war the Germans counted the number of patients in hospital every ten days, which omitted lightly wounded, expected to return to service in a few days, not evacuated from the corps area. After the war the Germans compiled the &quot;Sanitätsbericht&quot; (1934) the German Army Medical report of the World War 1914–1918, in which the Germans suffered at Cambrai, and died of wounds, and and prisoners of war.

==Memorials and cemeteries==
The Battle of Cambrai is commemorated annually by the Royal Tank Regiment on Cambrai Day. The contributions of the Newfoundland Regiment at the 1917 Battle of Cambrai are remembered in the village of Masnières at the Masnières Newfoundland Memorial. Cambrai Day is also celebrated by 2nd Lancers (GH) of the Indian Army on 1 December every year as Lance Dafadar Gobind Singh of that unit was awarded the Victoria Cross during this battle. The name Cambrai was chosen in 1917 as the new name for the South Australian town of Rhine Villa, one of many Australian place names changed from German names during the First World War. During the Remilitarization of the Rhineland in the late 1930s, Germany named a newly built Kaserne in Darmstadt after the battle, which was later merged with the nearby Freiherr von Fritsch Kaserne to become Cambrai-Fritsch Kaserne. The United States Army occupied Cambrai-Fritsch Kaserne from the end of the Second World War until 2008, when the land was returned to the German government.

===British burial sites===

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has four Memorials with the names or remains of servicemen dead during the Battle of Cambrai:
* Cambrai Memorial to the Missing – the monument lists soldiers of the United Kingdom and South Africa who died and have no known graves.
* Flesquieres Hill British Cemetery – 900 servicemen were buried, one third unidentified.
* Orival Wood Cemetery – 200 servicemen buried.
* Hermies Hill British Cemetery – 1,000 servicemen buried.

===German burial sites===
The German War Cemetery on the Route de Solesmes was established before the offensive in May 1917; it accommodates the remains of and soldiers.

<text>Trinity College Dublin (), abbreviated as Trinity or TCD, officially titled The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin, is the first and sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I, who granted a royal charter on the advice of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and former Archbishop of Armagh, Adam Loftus, and it was modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and Cambridge, with whom Dublin shares a unique relation. As one of the seven &quot;ancient universities&quot; of Great Britain and Ireland, Trinity has significantly influenced Irish literature, as well as areas of science, medicine, and law.

Functionally largely synonymous with the University of Dublin, Trinity was established to consolidate the rule of the Tudor monarchy in Ireland, with its first Provost, Loftus, christening it after his alma mater, Trinity College, Cambridge. It stands on the former grounds of the Priory of All Hallows which was abolished by King Henry VIII, and it served as the principal university of the ruling Ascendancy elite for over two centuries. Academically, Trinity has three main faculties comprising 24 schools, and the undergraduate admissions are competitive, with an acceptance rate of 17%. The Royal Irish Academy of Music, The Lir Academy, and the Marino Institute are associated colleges. Trinity College Dublin is a sister college of both Oriel College, Oxford, and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and by mutual incorporation, graduates of the three universities can receive &quot;Oxon, Cantab, et Dubl&quot; degrees. 

The college contains landmarks such as the Campanile and The Rubrics, as well as the historic Old Library. Trinity&#x27;s legal deposit library serves both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and has housed the Book of Kells since 1661, the Brian Boru harp since 1782, and a copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic since 1916. As a part of Ireland&#x27;s tourism industry, the campus receives two million visitors annually, partly due to its folklores, and has been used as a location in numerous movies and novels. Trinity was also involved in the First World War, most noticeably in the Defence of Gallipoli at the Dardanelles.

The university is known for its rigor in literature, and notable alumni include playwrights Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett; satirist Jonathan Swift; novelists Bram Stoker and J. S. Le Fanu; poet Oliver Goldsmith; philosophers George Berkeley and Edmund Burke; and scriptwriters David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. The recipients of 28 Cunningham Medals, 4 Copley Medals, 2 Booker Prizes and a Pulitzer Prize; the past awardees of 6 Victoria Cross, 29 Legion of Honour, and 4 Pour le Mérite; as well as 14 Chief Justices, 8 Nobel Laureates, 5 Heads of State, 34 Presidents of the Royal Irish Academy, and 46 Fellows of the Royal Society, are affiliated with Trinity, as are 79 Fulbright scholars, 63 Olympians, 5 billionaires, and 3 Oscar award winners.

==History==
===First 50 years===
A medieval University of Dublin was founded in 1320 under a papal brief issued by Pope Clement V in 1311, and the university maintained an intermittent existence at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral over the following centuries, but it did not flourish and finally came to an end during the Reformation period. After that, and some debate about a new university at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, in 1592 a small group of Dublin citizens obtained a charter by way of letters patent from Queen Elizabeth I, incorporating Trinity College at the former site of the disbanded Augustinian Priory of All Hallows, immediately southeast of the city walls, provided by the Corporation of Dublin.

The college&#x27;s first provost was the Archbishop of Dublin, Adam Loftus (after whose former college at Cambridge the institution was named), and he was provided with two initial Fellows, James Hamilton and James Fullerton. Two years after the foundation, a few Fellows and students began to work in the new college, which then lay around one small square.

During the initial 50 years following the foundation, the community increased the endowments, considerable landed estates were secured, and new fellowships and academic chairs were established. The books which formed the foundation of the great library were acquired, either by private purchase or donations, a curriculum was devised, and statutes were framed.

====Ethos and purpose====
Trinity was originally the university of the Protestant Ascendancy ruling elite for much of its history, given the conditions for its establishment. While Catholics were admitted from the college&#x27;s foundation, for a period, graduation required the taking of an oath that was objectionable to them. In 1793, this requirement was removed but certain restrictions on membership of the college remained; professorships, fellowships and scholarships remained reserved only for Protestants.

===18th and 19th centuries===
During the 18th century, Trinity College was seen as the university of the Protestant Ascendancy. The Parliament of Ireland, meeting on the other side of College Green, made generous grants for building the College&#x27;s 18th-century neoclassical Parliament sqaure. The first building of this period was the Old Library, begun in 1712, followed by The Printing House and the Dining Hall. During the second half of the century, the Parliament Square slowly emerged. The great building drive was mostly completed by the early 19th century with the inauguration of the Botany Bay, the square which derives its name in part from the herb garden it once contained. Today, the square contains Trinity College&#x27;s own Botanic Gardens.

The 19th century was also marked by important developments in the professional schools. The law school was reorganized after the middle of the century. Medical studies had been taught in the college since 1711, but it was only after the establishment of the school on a firm basis by legislation in 1800, and under the inspiration of one Macartney, that it was in a position to play its full part, with such teachers as Graves and Stokes, in the great age of Dublin medicine. The Engineering School was established in 1842, and was among the first of its kind in Ireland and Britain.

====Access and religion====
While Catholics were officially admitted from the foundation, graduation was complicated by the requirement of oaths. Following early steps in Catholic Emancipation, these oaths were removed, allowing Catholics to graduate in 1793, before the equivalent change at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford, although some restrictions remained. In December 1845, Denis Caulfield Heron was the subject of a hearing at Trinity College. He had previously been examined and, on merit, been declared a Scholar of the college, but had not been allowed to take up his place due to his Catholic religion. Heron appealed to the Irish courts, which issued a Writ of Mandamus requiring the case to be adjudicated by the Archbishop of Dublin and the Primate of Ireland. The decision of Richard Whately and John George de la Poer Beresford was that Heron would remain excluded from Scholarship. This decision confirmed that students who were not Anglicans (Presbyterians were also affected) could not be elected as Scholars, Fellows, or be made a professor. Within three decades of this, however, all disabilities and restrictions imposed on Catholics were repealed. In 1873, all religious tests, except for those relating to entry to the Divinity school, were abolished by an Act of Parliament.

In 1871, just prior to the full repeal of all limitations on Catholic students, Irish Catholic bishops, responding to the increased ease with which Catholics could attend an institution which the bishops saw as thoroughly Protestant in ethos, and in light of the establishment of the Catholic University of Ireland, implemented a general ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, with few exceptions. &quot;The ban&quot;, despite its longevity, is associated in the popular mind with the Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid, as he was made responsible for enforcing it from 1956 until the Catholic Bishops of Ireland rescinded it in 1970, shortly before McQuaid&#x27;s retirement. Until 1956, it was the responsibility of each local bishop.

===20th century===
In April 1900, Queen Victoria visited College Green in Dublin. Women were admitted to Trinity College as full members for the first time in 1904. From 1904 to 1907, women from Oxford and Cambridge, who were admitted but not granted degrees, came to Trinity College to receive their ad eundem degree; they were known as Steamboat ladies and the fees they paid helped to fund Trinity Hall.

In 1907, the Chief Secretary for Ireland proposed the reconstitution of the University of Dublin. A &quot;Dublin University Defence Committee&quot; was created and successfully campaigned against any change to the status quo, while the Catholic bishops&#x27; rejection of the idea ensured its failure among the Catholic population. Chief among the bishops&#x27; concerns was the remains of the Catholic University of Ireland, which would become subsumed into a new university, which on account of Trinity College would be part Anglican. Ultimately this episode led to the creation of the National University of Ireland.

Trinity College was one of the targets of the Volunteer and Citizen Army forces during the 1916 Easter Rising but was successfully defended by a small number of unionist students, most of whom were members of the university Officers&#x27; Training Corps. From July 1917 to March 1918, the Irish Convention met in the college in an attempt to address the political aftermath of the Easter Rising. Subsequently, following the failure of the convention to reach &quot;substantial agreement&quot;, the Irish Free State was set up in 1922. In the post-independence period, Trinity College suffered from a cool relationship with the new state. On 3 May 1955, the provost, A.J. McConnell, wrote in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; that certain state-funded County Council scholarships excluded Trinity College from the list of approved institutions. This, he suggested, amounted to religious discrimination, which was forbidden by the Constitution. 

It has also been said of the period before Ireland left the Commonwealth that, &quot;The overwhelming majority of the undergraduates were ex-unionists or, if from Northern Ireland, unionists. Loyalty to the Crown was instinctive and they were proud to be British subjects and Commonwealth citizens&quot;, and that &quot;The College still clung, so far as circumstances permitted, to its pre-Treaty loyalties, symbolized by the flying of the Union Jack on suitable occasions and a universal wearing of poppies on Armistice Day, the chapel being packed for the two minutes&#x27; silence followed by a lusty rendering of &#x27;God Save the King...&quot;. &quot;But by the close of the 1960s... Trinity, with the overwhelming majority of its undergraduate population coming from the Republic, to a great extent conformed to local patterns&quot;.

The School of Commerce was established in 1925, and the School of Social Studies in 1934. Also in 1934, the first female professor was appointed.

In 1944, the Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid required Catholics in the Dublin archdiocese to obtain a special dispensation before entering the university, under threat of automatic excommunication. The ban was extended nationally at the Plenary Synod of Maynooth in August 1956. Despite this sectarianism, 1958 saw the first Catholic reach the Board of Trinity as a Senior fellow.

In 1962 the School of Commerce and the School of Social Studies amalgamated to form the School of Business and Social Studies. In 1969 several schools and departments were grouped into Faculties as follows: Arts (Humanities and Letters); Business, Economic and Social Studies; Engineering and Systems Sciences; Health Sciences (since October 1977 all undergraduate teaching in dental science in the Dublin area has been in Trinity College); and Science.

In the late 1960s, there was a proposal for University College Dublin, of the National University of Ireland, to become a constituent college of a newly reconstituted University of Dublin. This plan, suggested by Brian Lenihan and Donogh O&#x27;Malley, was dropped after officials of both universities opposed it.

In 1970 the Catholic Church lifted its ban on Catholics attending the college without special dispensation. At the same time, Trinity College authorities invited the appointment of a Catholic chaplain to be based in the college. There are now two such Catholic chaplains.

From 1975, the Colleges of Technology that now form the Dublin Institute of Technology had their degrees conferred by the University of Dublin. This arrangement was discontinued in 1998 when the DIT obtained degree-granting powers of its own.

The School of Pharmacy was established in 1977, and around the same time, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was transferred to University College Dublin in exchange for its Dental School. Student numbers increased sharply during the 1980s and 1990s, with total enrolment more than doubling, leading to pressure on resources and a subsequent investment programme. In 1991, Thomas Noel Mitchell became the first Roman Catholic elected Provost of Trinity College.

===21st century===

Trinity College is today in the centre of Dublin. At the beginning of the new century, it embarked on a radical overhaul of academic structures to reallocate funds and reduce administration costs, resulting in, for instance, the reduction from six to five to eventually three faculties under a subsequent restructuring. The ten-year strategic plan prioritises four research themes with which the college seeks to compete for funding at the global level. Comparative funding statistics reviewing the difference in departmental unit costs and overall costs before and after this restructuring are not apparent.

The Hamilton Mathematics Institute in Trinity College, named in honour of William Rowan Hamilton, was launched in 2005 and aims to improve the international profile of Irish mathematics, to raise public awareness of mathematics and to support local mathematical research through workshops, conferences and a visitor programme.

In 2021, Linda Doyle was elected the first woman Provost, succeeding Patrick Prendergast. In 2024, students set up an encampment outside the Book of Kells Museum regarding the university&#x27;s ties to Israel. After five nights of protests, the administration declared that it would not renew its business relationships with Israeli companies, and the last contract will expire in March 2025.

==Buildings and grounds==
The main site of Trinity College has been described as retaining a tranquil collegiate atmosphere despite its location in the centre of a capital city, and despite it being one of Dublin&#x27;s, and Ireland&#x27;s, most prominent tourist attractions, with more than 2 million visitors annually. This is, in large part, due to the enclosed and compact design of the college, with the main buildings looking inwards, largely arranged in quadrangles (called squares), and the existence of only a few public entrances. In addition to the main site of the college, Trinity owns a number of buildings nearby in central Dublin, as well as an enterprise centre near Ringsend and a botanic garden in Dartry. The college has been used as a location in numerous movies and novels.

Patrick Wyse Jackson, curator of the Geological Museum at Trinity, assessed the architectural merits of the entrance and entry buildings in 1993: 

&quot;The imposing entrance to Trinity College, consisting of a central area flanked by two square pavilions, was built in the 1750s of Leinster Granite from Golden Hill, Co Wicklow, and Portland Stone was used for the architraves, swags, and Corinthian pilasters and half-columns... The masonry cost £27,000. Between 1990 and 1992 the central portion of the building was cleaned. Passing through the gateway one walks over a wooden floor of interlocking hexagonal setts (similar in pattern to the basaltic Giant&#x27;s Causeway), and into Parliament Square, which is dominated by the identical Corinthian fronts, in Leinster Granite and Portland Stone, of the Chapel on the left and the Examination Hall on the right. Further into the square on the left-hand side is the Dining Hall, restored after a fire in 1984. For reasons unknown, until 1870 the clock in the portico was set fifteen minutes after Dublin time.&quot;

The hexagonal setts are made of oak, chosen for its noise absorption qualities, and was a common form of paving in the forecourts of hospitals. 

===Main site===
The main college grounds are approximately 190,000 m2 (47 acres), including the Trinity College Enterprise Centre some distance away, and buildings provide around 200,000 m2 of floor space, ranging from works of older architecture to more modern buildings. The college&#x27;s main entrance is on College Green, and its grounds are bounded by Nassau and Pearse Streets. The college is bisected by College Park, which has both a cricket and a rugby pitch.

The college&#x27;s western side is older, featuring the Campanile, as well as many fine buildings, including the Chapel and Examination Hall (designed by Sir William Chambers), Graduates Memorial Building, Museum Building, and The Rubrics (the sole surviving section of the original 17th-century quadrangle), all spread across the college&#x27;s five squares. An organ case held within the Examination Hall was noted by &quot;Dublin Tourism&quot; to be the oldest existing Irish made organ case, reputed to have been built in 1684 by Lancelot Pearse. The gilt oak chandelier which hangs in the Examination Hall was taken from the old Irish House of Commons in nearby College Green.

The Provost&#x27;s House sits a little way up from the College Front Gate such that the House is actually on Grafton Street, one of the two principal shopping streets in the city, while its garden faces into the college. The Douglas Hyde Gallery, a contemporary art gallery, is in the college, as is the Samuel Beckett Theatre. It hosts national and international performances and is used by the Dublin International Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, and The Fringe Festival, among others. During the academic term, it is predominantly used as a teaching and performance space for drama students and staff.

The college&#x27;s eastern side is occupied by science buildings, most of which are modern developments, arranged in three rows instead of quadrangles. In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked it one of the 15 most beautiful college grounds in the world.

====Chapel====

The current chapel was completed in 1798, and was designed by George III&#x27;s architect, Sir William Chambers, who also designed the public theatre opposite the chapel on Parliament Square. Reflecting the college&#x27;s Anglican heritage, there are daily services of Morning prayer, weekly services of Evensong, and Holy Communion is celebrated on Tuesdays and Sundays. It is no longer compulsory for students to attend these.

The chapel has been ecumenical since 1970, and is now also used daily in the celebration of Mass for the college&#x27;s Roman Catholic members. According to a &quot;Dublin Tourism&quot; brochure in the late 1990s, it was the &quot;only chapel in the country which is shared by all the Christian denominations&quot;. In addition to the Anglican chaplain, who is known as the Dean of Residence, there are two Roman Catholic chaplains and one Methodist chaplain. Ecumenical events are often held in the chapel, such as the annual carol service and the service of thanksgiving on Trinity Monday.

Behind the chapel is a small cemetery named Challenor&#x27;s Corner, which is reserved for the burial of Provosts of the college. The space is named after Luke Challenor, who was buried there in 1613.

====Library====
The Library of Trinity College is Ireland&#x27;s largest research library. As a result of its historic standing, Trinity College Library Dublin is a legal deposit library (as per Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003) for the United Kingdom, and has a similar standing in Irish law. The college is therefore legally entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain and Ireland, and consequently receives over 100,000 new items every year. The library contains about five million books, including 30,000 current serials and significant collections of manuscripts, maps, and printed music. Three million books are held in the book depository, known as the &quot;Stacks&quot;, in Santry, from which requests are retrieved twice daily.

The Library proper comprises several buildings in the college. The original (Old) Library is Thomas Burgh&#x27;s masterpiece. A huge building, it originally towered over the university and the city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street. It was founded with the college and first endowed by James Ussher (1625–56), Archbishop of Armagh, who endowed his own valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the college. The Book of Kells is by far the Library&#x27;s most famous book and is in the Old Library, along with the Book of Durrow, the Book of Howth and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library receives over 900,000 visitors per year, making it Dublin&#x27;s second-most visited tourist destination. In the 18th century, the college received the Brian Boru harp, one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, now housed in the library.

The buildings known as the college&#x27;s BLU (Berkeley Lecky Ussher) Arts library complex consist of the Berkeley Library in Fellow&#x27;s Square, built in 1956; the Lecky Library, attached to the Arts building; and the Ussher Library, which, opening in 2003, overlooks College Park and houses the Glucksman Map Library. The Glucksman Library contains half a million printed maps, the largest collection of cartographic materials in Ireland. This includes the first Ordnance Surveys of Ireland, conducted in the early 19th century.

The name of the Berkeley Library recently became a matter of controversy, given George Berkeley&#x27;s history as a slave trader, leading to a petition for renaming from the Students Union. In August 2022, incoming Student Union President Gabi Fullam announced that the Students Union would refer to the library as the &quot;X Library&quot; in all official communications pending renaming. In April 2023, Trinity College announced that it would dename the Berkeley Library, and in October 2024 it was renamed the Eavan Boland Library after the Irish poet Eavan Boland.

The Library also includes the William Hamilton Science and Engineering Library and the John Stearne Medical Library, housed at St James&#x27;s Hospital.

====Business school====

The Trinity College Business School&#x27;s building is in an €80 million construction project and was inaugurated on 23 May 2019 by the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, an alumnus of Trinity College School of Medicine. The six-storey building, adjoining the Naughton Institute on the college&#x27;s Pearse Street side, includes an Innovation and Entrepreneurial hub, a 600-seat auditorium, &quot;smart classrooms&quot; with digital technology, and an &quot;executive education centre&quot;. The near-zero energy building provides a link between the city and the main University grounds.

===Other facilities===
Trinity also incorporates a number of buildings and facilities spread throughout the city, from the politics and sociology departments on Dame Street to the Faculty of Health Sciences buildings, located at St. James&#x27;s Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital. The Trinity Centre at St James&#x27;s Hospital incorporates additional teaching rooms, as well as the Institute of Molecular Medicine and John Durkan Leukaemia Institute.

The college&#x27;s botanic garden, which developed from a herb garden on the main site, is located in Dartry, around four kilometres south of the main site, and it also owns a large set of residences on the Dartry Road, in Rathmines, called Trinity Hall. A new physic or herb garden was opened in 2011, and there are also small gardens in the space known as Botany Bay and at the rear of the Provost&#x27;s House.

In November 2018, Trinity announced plans, estimated at €230 million, to develop university research facilities on a site in Grand Canal Dock as part of an &quot;Innovation District&quot; for the area. These plans were later scaled back.

In addition to College Park, Botany Bay and other on-site facilities, the college also owns sports grounds in Santry and Crumlin, and a boathouse in Islandbridge.

==Charter==
Trinity is governed in accordance with amended versions of the Letters Patent of Elizabeth I, as well as various other statutes. On several occasions, the founding Letters Patent were amended by later monarchs, such as James I in 1613, and most notably Charles I in 1637 - the latter increased the number of fellows from seven to 16, established the Board – initially consisting of the Provost and the seven senior Fellows – and reduced the panel of Visitors in size. Further major changes were made in the reign of Queen Victoria, and more again by the Oireachtas, including in 2000.

==Organisation==

The college, officially incorporated as &quot;The Provost, Fellows and Scholars of the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin&quot;, is headed by the Provost. Linda Doyle has been Provost since August 2021.

The terms &quot;University of Dublin&quot; and &quot;Trinity College&quot; are generally considered synonymous for all practical purposes. Trinity was originally founded using the models of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge in England, both of which are collegiate universities that each comprise several quasi-independent colleges. In one sense, the University of Dublin exists only as a degree-granting institution, with the college providing the education and research; Trinity College was the only college to ever be established within the university.

===Governance===

The body corporate of the college consists of the provost, fellows and scholars. The college is governed according to its statutes, which are, in effect, the College Constitution. Statutes are of two kinds, those which originally could only be amended by Royal Charter or Royal Letters Patent, and which now can only be changed by an Act of the Oireachtas, and those which can be changed by the board but only with the Fellows&#x27; consent. 

When a change requires parliamentary legislation, the customary procedure is that the Board requests the change by applying for a Private Bill. For this, the whole Body Corporate&#x27;s consent is needed, with Scholars voting alongside Fellows. An example of a change that requires parliamentary legislation is an alteration to the composition of the Board. This last happened when the governance of the college and university was revised and restated by an Act of the Oireachtas in 2000.

==== Provost ====
The Provost serves a ten-year term and is elected by a body of electors consisting essentially of all full-time academic staff and a very small number of students. Originally the Provost was appointed for life. While the Provost was elected by the Fellows at the start, the appointment soon became a Crown one, reflecting the growing importance of the college and of the office of provost, which became both prestigious and well-paid. But as time passed, it became customary that the appointments were only made after taking soundings of college opinion, which meant mostly the views of the Board. 

With the establishment of the Free State in 1922, the power of appointment were passed to the Irish Government. It was agreed that when a vacancy occurred the college would provide a list of three candidates to the Government, from which the choice would be made. The college was allowed to rank the candidates in order of preference, and in practice, the most preferred candidate was always appointed. Now the Provost, while still formally appointed by the Government, is elected by staff plus student representatives, who gather in an electoral meeting and vote by exhaustive ballot until a candidate obtains an absolute majority; the process takes a day.

The Provost takes precedence over everyone else in the college, acts as the chief executive and accounting officer and chairs the board and council. The Provost also enjoys a special status in the University of Dublin.

==== Fellows and Scholars ====
Fellows and Scholars are elected by the board. Fellows were once elected for life on the basis of a competitive examination. The number of Fellows was fixed and a competition to fill a vacancy would occur on the death or resignation of a Fellow. Originally all the teaching was carried out by the Fellows. Fellows are now elected from among current college academics and serve until reaching retirement age, and there is no formal limit on their number. 

Only a minority of academic staff are Fellows. Election to Fellowship is recognition for staff that they have excelled in their field and amounts to a promotion for those receiving it. Any person appointed to a professorship who is not already a Fellow is elected a Fellow at the next opportunity.

Scholars continue to be selected by competitive examination from the Undergraduate body. The Scholarship examinations are now set separately for different undergraduate courses (so there is a Scholarship examination in history, or in mathematics, engineering, and so forth). The Scholarship examination is taken in the second year of a four-year degree course (though, in special circumstances, such as illness, bereavement, or studying abroad during the second year, permission may be given to sit the examination in the third year). 

In theory, students can sit the examination in any subject, not just the one they are studying. They hold their Scholarship until they are of &quot;MA standing&quot; – that is, three years after obtaining the BA degree. Most are thus Scholars for five years.

Fellows are entitled to residence in the college free of charge; most do not exercise this right in practice, with the legal requirement to provide accommodation to them fulfilled by providing an office. Scholars are also entitled to residence in the college free of charge; they also receive an allowance and have the fees paid for courses they take within the college. 

Due to the pressure on college accommodation, Scholars are no longer entitled, as they once were, to free rooms for the full duration of their Scholarship should they cease to be students. Fellows and Scholars are also entitled to one free meal a day, usually in the evening (&quot;Commons&quot;). Scholars also retain the right to free meals for the full duration of their Scholarship even after graduation, and ceasing to be students, should they choose to exercise it.

====Board====
Aside from the Provost, Fellows and Scholars, Trinity College has a Board (dating from 1637), which carries out general governance. Originally the Board consisted of the Provost and Senior Fellows only. There were seven Senior Fellows, defined as those seven fellows that had served longest, Fellowship at that time being for life, unless resigned. 

Over the years, a representational element was added, for example by having elected representatives of the Junior Fellows and of those professors who were not Fellows, with the last revision before Irish Independence being made by Royal Letters Patent in 1911. At that time there were, as well as the Senior Fellows, two elected representatives of those professors who were not Fellows and elected representatives of the Junior Fellows. Over the years, while formal revision did not take place, partly due to the complexity of the process, a number of additional representatives were added to the Board but as &quot;observers&quot; and not full voting members. These included representatives of academic staff who were not Fellows, and representatives of students. 

In practice, all attending the Board meetings were treated as equals, with votes, while not common, were taken by a show of hands. But it remained the case that legally only the full members of the Board could have their votes recorded and it was mere convention that they always ratified the decision taken by the show of hands.

The governance of Trinity College was next formally changed in 2000, by the Oireachtas, in The Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act 2000, legislation proposed by the Board of the college and approved by the Body Corporate. This was introduced separately from the Universities Act 1997. 

It states that the Board shall comprise of
* The Provost, Vice-Provost/Chief Academic Officer, Senior Lecturer, Registrar and Bursar;
* Six Fellows;
* Five members of the academic staff who are not Fellows, at least three of whom must be of a rank not higher than senior lecturer;
* Two members of the academic staff of the rank of professor;
* Three members of the non-academic staff;
* Four students of the college, at least one of whom shall be a post-graduate student;
* One member, not an employee or student of the college, chosen by a Board committee from nominations made by organisations &quot;representative of such business or professional interest as the Board considers appropriate&quot;;
* One member nominated by the Minister for Education following consultation with the Provost.

====Council====
A Council, dating from 1874, oversees academic matters. All decisions of the Council require the approval of the Board, but if the decision in question does not require a new expenditure, the approval is normally formal, without debate. 

The council had a significant number of elected representatives from the start, and was also larger than the Board, which at that time continued to consist of the provost and seven Senior Fellows only. The council is the formal body which makes academic staff appointments, always, in practice on the recommendation of appointments panels which have themselves been appointed by the council. 

An illustration of the relationship between the Board and the council is a decision to create a new professorial chair. As this involves paying a salary, the initial decision to create the chair is made by the council, but the decision to make provision for the salary is made by the Board; consequently, the Board might overrule or defer a Council decision on grounds of cost.

====Senate====

The University of Dublin was modelled on University of Oxford and University of Cambridge in the form of a collegiate university, Trinity College being the name given by the Queen as the &quot;mater universitatis&quot; (&quot;mother of the university&quot;). 

As no other college was ever established, the college is the university&#x27;s sole constituent college, and so &quot;Trinity College&quot; and the &quot;University of Dublin&quot; are for most purposes synonymous. Still, the statutes of the university and the college grant the university separate corporate legal rights to own property and borrow money and employ staff. 

Moreover, while the Board of the college has the sole power to propose amendments to the statutes of the university and college, amendments to the university statutes require the consent of the Senate of the university. Consequently, in theory, the Senate can overrule the Board, but only in very limited and particular circumstances. However, it is also the case that the university cannot act independently of the initiative of the Board of Trinity College. The most common example of when the two bodies must collaborate is when a decision is made to establish a new degree.

All matters relating to syllabus, examination and teaching are for the college to determine, but actual clearance for the award of the degree is a matter for the university. In the same way, when an individual is awarded an Honorary Degree, the proposal for the award is made by the Board of Trinity College, but this is subject to agreement by a vote of the Senate of Dublin University. All graduates of the university who have at least a master&#x27;s degree are eligible to be members of the Senate, but in practice, only a few hundred are, with a large proportion being current members of the staff of Trinity College.

====Visitors====
The college also has an oversight structure of two Visitors: the Chancellor of the university, who is elected by the Senate, and the judicial Visitor, who is appointed by the Irish Government from a list of two names submitted by the Senate of the university. The current judicial Visitor is Maureen Harding Clark. In the event of a disagreement between the two Visitors, the opinion of the Chancellor prevails.

The Visitors act as a final &quot;court of appeal&quot; within the college, with their modes of appointment giving them the needed independence from the college administration.

===Academic associations===
Trinity College is a sister college to Oriel College of the University of Oxford and St John&#x27;s College of the University of Cambridge. In accordance with the formula of , a form of recognition that exists among the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge and the University of Dublin, a graduate of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin can be conferred with the equivalent degree at either of the other two universities without further examination, a process referred to as &quot;Incorporation&quot;.
==== Teaching and affiliated hospitals ====
As of 2021, the teaching and associated hospitals are:
* Tallaght University Hospital
* St. James&#x27;s Hospital
* St Patrick&#x27;s University Hospital
* Dublin Dental University Hospital
* Naas General Hospital
* Coombe Women &amp; Infants University Hospital
* Rotunda Hospital
* Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital
* Children&#x27;s Health Ireland at Crumlin
* Peamount Hospital
* National Rehabilitation Hospital

==== Associated Institutions ====

* Royal Irish Academy of Music
* Marino Institute of Education
* Church of Ireland Theological Institute
* The Lir Academy

The School of Business in association with the Irish Management Institute forms the Trinity-IMI Graduate School of Management, incorporating the faculties of both organisations. Trinity College has also formerly been associated with several other teaching institutions, such as St Catherine&#x27;s College of Education for Home Economics (now closed), Magee College and Royal Irish Academy of Music, a music conservatoire, and The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art, the national conservatoire for theatre training actors, technicians, playwrights and designers to a professional and industry standard. The Lir is also advised by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the UK.

===Parliamentary representation===

The university has been linked to parliamentary representation since 1613, when James I granted it the right to elect two members of parliament (MPs) to the Irish House of Commons. 

Since the new Constitution of Ireland in 1937, the graduates of the university have formed a political constituency which elects three Senators to Seanad Éireann. The current representatives of the university constituency are David Norris and Lynn Ruane, with one vacancy. Notable representatives have included Edward Gibson, W. E. H. Lecky, Edward Carson, Noel Browne, Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien and Mary Robinson. The franchise was originally restricted to the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity College. This was expanded in 1832 to include those who had received an MA, and in 1918 all those who had received a degree from the university.

==Academic profile==
Since considerable academic restructuring in 2008, the college has three academic faculties:
* Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences
* Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
* Health Sciences

Each faculty is headed by a dean (there is also a Dean of Postgraduate Studies), and faculties are divided into schools, of which there were 24 as of 2021.

===Academic year===
The academic year is divided into three terms:

* Michaelmas term lasts from October to December 

* Hilary term from January to March

* Trinity term from April to June

Each term is separated by a vacation, and whilst teaching takes place across all three terms in postgraduate courses, for undergraduate programmes, teaching is condensed within the first two terms since 2009, with each term consisting of a 12-week period of teaching known as the Teaching Term. These are followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period during the Trinity Term.

Internally at least, the weeks in the term are often referred to by the time elapsed since the start of the teaching Term: thus the first week is called &quot;1st week&quot; or &quot;week 1&quot; and the last is &quot;Week 12&quot; or &quot;12th week&quot;.

The first week of Trinity Term (which marks the conclusion of lecturing for that year) is known as Trinity Week; normally preceded by a string of balls, it consists of a week of sporting and academic events. This includes the Trinity Ball and the Trinity Regatta (a premier social event on the Irish rowing calendar held since 1898), the election of Scholars and Fellows, and a college banquet.

===Second-level programmes===
Since 2014, Trinity College&#x27;s science department has established and operated a scheme for second-level students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

The system, similar to DCU&#x27;s CTYI programme, encourages academically gifted secondary students with a high aptitude for the STEM subjects, and was named the Walton Club in honour of Ernest Walton, Ireland&#x27;s first and only Nobel laureate in Physics. The programme was centred upon a pedagogic principle of &quot;developing capacity for learning autonomy&quot;. 

The educators in the programme are PhD students in the college, who impart an advanced, undergraduate-level curriculum to the students. The club was set up with a specific ethos around the mentoring of STEM subjects, and not as a grinds school. The scheme has been immensely successful and undergone growth in scope and scale year on year. It has also diversified beyond its traditional weekly club structure, running camps during school holidays to offer an opportunity to study STEM to those unable to join the club. 

It has also represented the college in many activities, meeting Chris Hadfield and attending the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition and the Web Summit. Students, or alphas as they are dubbed in honour of the eponymous physicist, develop projects in the club, with innovations pioneered there including a health-focused electroencephalogram. The club was founded by Professors Igor Shvets and Arlene O&#x27;Neill of the School of Physics in Trinity College.

===Undergraduate===

Most undergraduate courses require four years of study. First-year students at the undergraduate level are called Junior Freshmen; second-years, Senior Freshmen; third-years, Junior Sophisters; and fourth-years, Senior Sophisters. 

After a 2017 proposal by the SU Equality Committee, the Trinity College Board approved a three-year process changing the titles of first and second years to Junior and Senior Fresh. 

Students must take the exams during Michaelmas term and during Trinity term of each year, and those who pass the exams can enter the next year. Students who score at least 70% on the exams will receive a first-class honours degree, 60–69% an upper second-class honours degree, 50–59% a lower second-class honours degree, and 40–49% a third-class honours degree.

Most non-professional courses take a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. As a matter of tradition, bachelor&#x27;s degree graduates are eligible, after seven years from matriculation and without additional study, to purchase for a fee an upgrade of their bachelor&#x27;s degree to a Master of Arts.

Degree titles vary according to the subject of study. The Law School awards the LL.B., the LL.B. (ling. franc.) and the LL.B. (ling. germ.). Other degrees include the BAI (engineering) and BBS (business studies). The BSc degree is not in wide use although it is awarded by the School of Nursing and Midwifery; most science and computer science students are awarded a BA.

From 2018, Trinity will be offering a dual BA programme with Columbia University in New York City. Students of history, English, European studies or Middle Eastern and European languages and culture spend their first two years at Trinity and their last two years at Columbia.

===Postgraduate===
At postgraduate level, Trinity offers a range of taught and research degrees in all faculties. About 29% of students are post-graduate level, with 1,440 reading for a research degree and an additional 3,260 on taught courses (see Research and Innovation).

Trinity College&#x27;s Strategic Plan sets &quot;the objective of doubling the number of PhDs across all disciplines by 2013 in order to move towards a knowledge society. In order to achieve this, the college has received some of the largest allocations of Irish Government funding which have become competitively available to date.&quot;

In addition to academic degrees, the college offers Postgraduate Diploma (non-degree) qualifications, either directly or through associated institutions.

===Research===
The university operates an on-site Innovation Centre that promotes academic innovation and advising, provides patent counselling and in-depth research information, and also facilitates the creation and operation of industrial labs and campus businesses.

In 1999, the university purchased an enterprise centre on Pearse Street, a seven-minute walk from the on-site &quot;Innovation Center.&quot; The site has over 19,000 square metres of built space and includes a protected building, the Tower, which houses a Craft Centre. The Trinity Enterprise Centre is home to companies from Dublin&#x27;s university research sector.

===Admissions===
Undergraduate applications from Irish, British and European Union applicants are submitted and processed through the Central Applications Office (CAO) system. Trinity College instructs the CAO to administer all applications by standardised criteria before offering places to successful candidates. The college therefore has full control of admissions while ensuring anonymity and academic equality throughout the process. 

Admission to the university is highly competitive and based exclusively on academic merit. To be considered for admission, applicants must first reach the university&#x27;s minimum matriculation requirements, which typically involves holding sufficient recognised qualifications in English, mathematics and a second language; the mathematics requirement can be waived if Latin is presented as a second language. 

Applicants for certain courses may be required to achieve more specific qualifications than those prescribed for minimum matriculation requirements.

Eligible applicants must then compete for places based on the results of their school leaving examinations, but can additionally take matriculation examinations which are held in the university in April, in which each subject is considered equivalent to that of the Irish Leaving Certificate. Applications for restricted courses require further assessment considered in the admissions process, such as the Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT) for medicine or entrance tests for music and drama courses.

As applications for most courses far exceed available places, admission is highly selective, demanding excellent grades in the aforementioned examinations. Through the CAO, candidates may list several courses at Trinity College and at other third-level institutions in Ireland in order of preference. The CAO awards places in mid-August every year after matching the number of places available to the applicants&#x27; academic attainments. Qualifications are measured as &quot;points&quot;, with specific scales for the Leaving Certificate, UK GCE A-level, the International Baccalaureate and all other European Union school-leaving examinations.

In 2016, there were 3,220 new entrants out of 18,469 CAO applicants, indicating a competitive acceptance rate of 17.4%.

For applicants who are not citizens or residents of the European Union, different procedures apply. Disadvantaged, disabled, or mature students can also be admitted through a program that is separate from the CAO, the Trinity Access Programme, which aims to facilitate the entry of sectors of society which would otherwise be under-represented.

Students from non-European countries, such as the United States, may be admitted directly if they have passed the International Baccalaureate or EU/EFTA exams and meet the minimum admission requirements. Admission is not guaranteed and places will be filled in order of merit by the applicants with the highest score.

For those who have not taken the above exams, there is the one-year Foundation Program. This includes essays, discussions, question and answer sessions and training in study to prepare students for admission to Trinity College. Students must demonstrate proficiency in English to be admitted to the Foundation Program and must have a minimum score on the IELTS, TOEFL or Duolingo English Test (DET). Requirements also vary depending on the program. In addition to English language proficiency, students must meet the high school score.

Admission to graduate study is handled directly by Trinity College.

===Awards===
====Entrance Exhibition and sizarship====
Students who enter with exceptional Leaving Certificate or other public examination results are awarded an Entrance Exhibition. This entails a prize in the form of book tokens to the value of €150.00. Exhibitioners who are of limited means are made Sizars, entitled to Commons (evening meal) free of charge.

====Foundation Scholarship====
Undergraduate students of Senior Freshmen standing may elect to sit the Foundation Scholarship examination, which takes place in the Christmas Vacation, on the last week before Hilary term. 

On Trinity Monday (the first day of Trinity Term), the Board of the college sits and elects to the Scholarship all those who achieve First in the examination. Election to become a scholar of Trinity Dublin is widely regarded as &quot;the most prestigious undergraduate award in the country&quot;. Those from EU member countries are entitled to free rooms and Commons (the college&#x27;s Formal Hall), an annual stipend and exemption from fees for the duration of their scholarship, which lasts 15 terms. 

Scholars from non-EU member countries have their fees reduced by the current value of EU member fees. Scholars may add the suffix &quot;SCH.&quot; to their names, have the note &quot;discip. schol.&quot; appended to their name at Commencements and are entitled to wear Bachelor&#x27;s Robes and a velvet mortarboard.

Competition for Scholarship involves a searching examination and successful candidates must be of exceptional ability. The concept of scholarship is a valued tradition of the college, and many of the college&#x27;s most distinguished members were elected scholars (including Samuel Beckett and Ernest Walton). The Scholars&#x27; dinner, to which &#x27;Scholars of the decade&#x27; (those elected in the current year, and every year multiple of a decade previous to it, e.g., 2013, 2003..) are invited, forms one of the major events in Trinity&#x27;s calendar. One of the main objectives is the pursuit of excellence, and one of the most tangible manifestations of this objective is the institution of the scholarship.

Under the Foundation Charter (of 1592), Scholars were part of the body corporate (three Scholars were named in the charter &quot;in the name of many&quot;). Until 1609, there were about 51 Scholars at any one time. A figure of 70 was permanently fixed in the revising Letters Patent of Charles I in 1637. Trinity Monday was appointed as the day when all future elections to Fellowship and Scholarship would be announced (at this time Trinity Monday was always celebrated on the Monday after the feast of the Holy Trinity). Up to this point, all undergraduates were Scholars, but soon after 1637 the practice of admitting students other than Scholars commenced.

Until 1856, only the classical subjects were examined. The questions concerned all the classical authors prescribed for the entrance examination and for the undergraduate course up to the middle of the Junior Sophister year. The candidates had no new material to read, &#x27;but they had to submit to a very searching examination on the fairly lengthy list of classical texts which they were supposed by this time to have mastered&#x27;. The close link with the undergraduate syllabus is underlined by the refusal until 1856 to admit Scholars to the Library (a request for admission was rejected by the Board in 1842, on the grounds that Scholars should stick to their prescribed books and not indulge in &#x27;those desultory habits&#x27; that admission to an extensive library would encourage). During the second half of the 19th century, the content of the examination gradually came to include other disciplines.

Around the turn of the 20th century, &quot;Non-Foundation&quot; Scholarships were introduced. This initially was a device to permit women to be, in effect, elected Scholars, despite the then commonly accepted legal view that the statute revision of 1637 permitted only males to be elected Foundation Scholars. Clearly, when women were not permitted in the college, this had not caused any difficulties, but with the admission of women as full members of the college, an anomaly was created. 

The Non-Foundation Scholarship granted to the women elected to it all the rights of men, with the exception of voting rights at a meeting of the Body Corporate, a very rare event in any case. As women are now admitted to Foundation Scholarship on exactly the same basis as men, Non-Foundation Scholarships are retained as a device to allow for more than 70 persons to be Scholars at any one time provided they meet the qualifying standards. Foundation Scholarships are given to those whose performance is considered particularly exceptional, with the remaining qualifying persons that year being elected as Non-Foundation Scholars. While the number of Foundation Scholars remains fixed at 70, there is, in theory, no limit on the number of Non-Foundation Scholars. 

Non-Foundation and Foundation Scholars receive the same benefits and therefore the two groups are regarded in equal esteem and usually refer to themselves collectively as the Scholars of Trinity College Dublin.

===Reputation===
Trinity is ranked 87th in the world, 26th in Europe and 1st in Ireland in the QS World University Rankings 2025, one of the world&#x27;s leading indicators of university evaluation. The highest ranking in the QS system was in 2009, when it was ranked 43rd in the world. Trinity is also ranked 139th in the world and 1st in Ireland in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025.

In response to a long-term decline in rankings (from 43rd according to the last combined THE/QS ranking in 2009 to 88th in QS and 117th in THE for 2018), in 2014 Trinity announced a plan to reverse the trend, aiming to reenter the top 50. The dentistry program offered by the Dublin Dental University Hospital is ranked 51–75 in the world.
==Student life==
===Societies===

As of 2020, Trinity College has 120+ societies. Student societies operate under the aegis of the Dublin University Central Societies Committee (CSC).

Situated in the Graduates Memorial Building (GMB) are the three oldest societies: University Philosophical Society (the Phil), the College Historical Society (the Hist) and the College Theological Society (the Theo). The Phil meets each Thursday evening in the chamber of the GMB, the Hist meets each Wednesday evening and the Theo meets each Monday evening. Both the Phil and the Hist claim to be the oldest such student society: the Phil claims to have been founded in 1683, although university records list its foundation as having occurred in 1853, while the Hist was founded in 1770, making it the college&#x27;s oldest society according to the Calendar. 

Records of Trinity&#x27;s Chapel Choir date from 1762; as it was not yet an official university society, it is now not considered the oldest. Among the Phil&#x27;s Honorary Patrons are multiple Nobel Prize laureates, heads of state, notable actors, entertainers and well-known intellectuals, such as Al Pacino, Desmond Tutu, Sir Christopher Lee, Stephen Fry, and John Mearsheimer. The Hist has been addressed by many notable orators, including Winston Churchill and Ted Kennedy, and counts among its former members many prominent men and women in Ireland&#x27;s history.

Other societies include Vincent de Paul Society (VDP), which organises a large number of charitable activities in the local community; DU Players, theatre and drama societies which hosts more than 50 shows and events a year in the Players Theatre; 

The DU Film Society, founded in 1987, which organises filmmakers and cinephiles in college through workshops, screenings, production funding, etc.; Trinity FM, which broadcasts six weeks a year on FM 97.3 with various student productions; and the Q Soc – Trinity LGBT society, which is Ireland&#x27;s oldest LGBT society and celebrated its 25th anniversary in the 2007/08 year. 

The Card and Bridge Society holds weekly poker and bridge tournaments and was the starting point for many notable alumni, including Andy Black, Padraig Parkinson and Donnacha O&#x27;Dea; the Dublin University Comedy Society, known as DU Comedy, hosts comedy events for its members and has hosted gigs in college by comedians such as Andrew Maxwell, David O&#x27;Doherty, Neil Delamere and Colin Murphy; 

The Dance Society, known as &quot;&quot;, provides classes in Latin and ballroom dancing, as well as running events around other styles, such as swing dancing. 

In 2011, the Laurentian Society was revived. It had played a key role as a society for the few Catholic students who studied at Trinity while &quot;the Ban&quot; was still in force. The Trinity Fashion Society was established in 2009, and holds an annual charity fashion show and an international trip to London Fashion Week.

===Clubs===
Trinity has a sporting tradition, and the college has 50 sports clubs affiliated to the Dublin University Central Athletic Club (DUCAC).

The Central Athletic Club is made up of five committees that oversee the development of sport in the college: the executive committee, which is responsible overall for all activities; the Captains&#x27; Committee, which represents the 49 club captains and awards University Colours (Pinks); the Pavilion Bar Committee, which runs the private members&#x27; bar; the Pavilion Members&#x27; Committee; and the Sports Facilities Committee.

The oldest clubs include the Dublin University Cricket Club (1835), the Dublin University Boat Club (1836) and Dublin University Fencing Club (1774). Dublin University Football Club, founded in 1854, plays rugby union and is the world&#x27;s oldest documented &quot;football club&quot;. Dublin University A.F.C., founded in 1883, is the oldest surviving association football club in the Republic of Ireland. The Dublin University Hockey Club was founded in 1893, and the Dublin University Harriers and Athletic Club in 1885.

The newest club in the university is the American football team, who were accepted into the Irish American Football League (IAFL) in 2008. The Dublin University Fencing Club has won a total of 43 titles in 66 years. While the modern DU Fencing Club was founded in 1936, its origins can be dated to the 1700s when a &#x27;Gentleman&#x27;s Club of the Sword&#x27; existed, primarily for duelling practice.

===Publications===
Trinity College has a tradition of student publications, ranging from the serious to the satirical. Most student publications are administered by Trinity Publications, previously called the Dublin University Publications Committee (often known as &#x27;Pubs&#x27;), which maintains and administers the Publications office (located in No 6) and all the associated equipment needed to publish newspapers and magazines.

From 1869 to 1893, the literary magazine &quot;Kottabos&quot; was published, edited by Robert Yelverton Tyrrell. It has been called &#x27;perhaps the cream of Irish academic wit and scholarship&#x27;.

There are two rival student newspapers: &quot;The University Times&quot; and &quot;Trinity News&quot;. &quot;The University Times&quot; is funded by the Students&#x27; Union and has won national and international awards since its inception in 2009, including the award for best non-daily student newspaper in the world from the US-based Society of Professional Journalists. &quot;Trinity News&quot; is Ireland&#x27;s oldest student newspaper, launched in 1953. It publishes both an online edition and a print edition every three weeks during the academic year. For the last 10 years, the paper has been edited by a full-time student editor, who takes a sabbatical year from their studies, supported by a voluntary part-time staff of 30 student section editors and writers.

Student magazines currently in publication include the satirical newspaper &quot;The Piranha&quot; (formerly &quot;Piranha!&quot; magazine but rebranded in 2009), the generalist &quot;T.C.D. Miscellany&quot; (founded in 1895; one of Ireland&#x27;s oldest magazines), the film journal &quot;Trinity Film Review&quot; (TFR) and the literary &quot;Icarus&quot;. 

Other publications include the &quot;Student Economic Review&quot; and the Trinity College Law Review, produced independently by students of economics and law respectively; the &quot;Trinity College Journal of Postgraduate Research&quot;, produced by the Graduate Students Union; the &quot;Social and Political Review&quot; (SPR); the &quot;Trinity Student Medical Journal&quot;; and &quot;The Attic&quot;, student writing produced by the &quot;Dublin University Literary Society.&quot; More recent publications include &quot;Trinity Business Review (TBR)&quot; and &quot;The Burkean Journal&quot;, a politically and culturally conservative magazine named after one of Trinity&#x27;s most notable alumni, Edmund Burke.

===Ball===

The Trinity Ball is an annual event that draws 7,000 attendees. Until 2010, it was held annually on the last teaching day of Trinity term to celebrate the end of lectures and the beginning of Trinity Week. Due to a restructuring of the teaching terms of the college, the 2010 Ball was held on the last day of Trinity Week. In 2011, the ball was held on the final day of teaching of Hilary Term, before the commencement of Trinity Week. The Ball is run by Trinity Ents, Trinity Students&#x27; Union and Trinity&#x27;s Central Societies Committee in conjunction with event promoters MCD Productions, who held the contract to run the Ball until 2012. The Ball celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009.

===Students&#x27; Union===

The Students&#x27; Union&#x27;s primary role is to provide a recognised representative channel between undergraduates (UG) and the university and college authorities. The Campaigns Executive, the Administrative Executive and the Sabbatical Officers manage the business and affairs of the Union. The Sabbatical Officers are: The President, Communications Officer, Welfare Officer, Education Officer and the Entertainments Officer, and are elected on an annual basis; all capitated students are entitled to vote. The SU President, Welfare Officer and Education Officer are ex-officio members of the College Board.

The Graduate Students&#x27; Union&#x27;s primary role is to provide a recognised representative channel between postgraduates (PG) and the university and college authorities. The GSU president is also an ex-officio member of the College Board.

==Traditions and culture==
===Commons===
Commons is a three-course meal served in the College Dining Hall Monday to Friday, attended by Scholars, Fellows and Sizars of the college, as well as other members of the college community and their guests.

Commons starts at 18:15 during the week, and its start is signalled by a dramatic slamming of the Dining Hall doors. The bell of the Campanile in the college is rung at 18:00 to inform those attending the dinner.

A Latin grace prayer is said &quot;before and after dinner&quot;, read by one of the scholars.

During Advent, members of the Chapel Choir, the oldest choir in the university, sing Christmas carols to accompany the meals.

===Trinity Week===
Trinity Week begins each year on Trinity Monday in mid-April.

The start of Trinity Week is marked by the election of Fellows and Scholars to the College on Trinity Monday. The board of the college, having chosen the new Scholars (those who achieved a First in the Foundation Scholarship) and Fellows, announce in front square those appointed, before an ecumenical service is held in the College Chapel, with music sung by the Chapel Choir.

===Other traditions===

Trinity has a longstanding rivalry with nearby University College Dublin, which is largely friendly in nature. Every year, Colours events are contested between the sporting clubs of each University, as well as between their respective debating societies.

==In popular culture==
The Irish writer J. P. Donleavy was a student in Trinity and a number of his books feature characters who attend Trinity, including &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; and &quot;The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B.&quot; 

Fictional Naval Surgeon Stephen Maturin of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s popular Aubrey–Maturin series is a graduate of Trinity College. The character is played by Paul Bettany in the 2003 film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. Claire Kilroy&#x27;s novel &quot;All Names Have Been Changed&quot; is set in Trinity College in the 1990s. The story follows a group of creative writing students and their enigmatic professor. A photograph of Trinity is used in the cover art. 

Barry McCrea&#x27;s novel &quot;The First Verse&quot; is set in Trinity College. The narrative focuses on freshman Niall Lenihan&#x27;s search for identity and companionship and details his involvement with mysticism at the college. In Karen Marie Moning&#x27;s &quot;The Fever Series&quot; Trinity College is said to be where the main character, MacKayla Lane&#x27;s sister Alina, was attending school on scholarship before she was murdered. The college is also where several of the minor characters who inform Ms. Lane about her sister are said to work. 

In Cecelia Ahern&#x27;s novel &quot;Thanks for the Memories&quot;, Justin Hitchcock is a guest lecturer at Trinity College.

Parts of &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot;, &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;, &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; and &quot;Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx&quot; were filmed in Trinity College. It served as the filming location for Luftwaffe headquarters in &quot;The Blue Max&quot;. In the Channel 4 television series &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, Craig Dean attends Trinity College. He left Hollyoaks to study in Ireland in 2007 and now lives there with his boyfriend, John Paul McQueen, after they got their sunset ending in September 2008. 

In the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode Fair Haven set in a holographic 19th century Ireland near Dublin, Captain Janeway reprograms the hologram character Michael Sullivan to have &quot;the education of a 19th century 3rd year student at Trinity College&quot;.

In Sally Rooney&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Normal People&quot; and its 2020 television adaptation, the main characters, Connell Waldron and Marianne Sheridan, are students at Trinity College and are elected scholars. Rooney studied English as a scholar in Trinity. 

In the television adaptation, Connell is played by former Trinity College (The Lir Academy) student Paul Mescal; two other actors in the series, Frank Blake (who plays Marianne&#x27;s older brother Alan) and Kwaku Fortune (who plays Philip, a friend of Marianne&#x27;s at Trinity), are also alumni of the Lir Academy. Series director and executive producer Lenny Abrahamson studied philosophy at Trinity and was also elected a scholar. Following the broadcast of the series, Trinity was widely reported to have received a substantial increase in applications, to a total of over 40,000, including a small increase in applications from the United Kingdom.

The Oscar Wilde Memorial Sculpture in Dublin&#x27;s Merrion Square depicts Wilde wearing the Trinity College postgraduate tie.

<text>An endolith or endolithic is an organism (archaeon, bacterium, fungus, lichen, algae, sponge, or amoeba) that is able to acquire the necessary resources for growth in the inner part of a rock, mineral, coral, animal shells, or in the pores between mineral grains of a rock. Many are extremophiles, living in places long considered inhospitable to life. The distribution, biomass, and diversity of endolith microorganisms are determined by the physical and chemical properties of the rock substrate, including the mineral composition, permeability, the presence of organic compounds, the structure and distribution of pores, water retention capacity, and the pH. Normally, the endoliths colonize the areas within lithic substrates to withstand intense solar radiation, temperature fluctuations, wind, and desiccation. 
They are of particular interest to astrobiologists, who theorize that endolithic environments on Mars and other planets constitute potential refugia for extraterrestrial microbial communities.

==Subdefinitions==
The term &quot;endolith&quot;, which defines an organism that colonizes the interior of any kind of rock, has been further classified into five subclasses:

;Chasmoendolith: Colonizes fissures and cracks in the rock connected to the surface (&quot;chasm&quot; = cleft)
;Cryptoendolith: Colonizes structural cavities within natural pore spaces within the rocks. These pores are usually indirectly connected to the rock surface; (&quot;crypto&quot; = hidden) 
;Euendolith: Penetrates actively into the interior of rocks forming channels and grooves that conform with the shape of its body, rock boring organism (&quot;eu&quot; = true)
;Hypoendolith: Colonizes the pore spaces located on the underside of the rock and that make contact with the soil (&quot;hypo&quot; = under)
;Autoendolith: Capable of rocks formation by mineral depositation (&quot;auto&quot; = self)

==Environment==
Endolithic microorganisms have been reported in many areas around the globe. There are reports in warm hyper-arid and arid deserts such as Mojave and Sonora (USA), Atacama (Chile), Gobi (China, Mongolia), Negev (Israel), Namib (Namibia Angola), Al-Jafr basin (Jordan) and the Depression of Turpan (China), also in cold deserts as Arctic and Antarctic, and deep subsoil and ocean trenches rocks. However, there are reports of endolithic microorganisms in inter-tropical zones, where humidity and solar radiation are significantly different from the above-mentioned biomes. Endoliths have been found in the rock down to a depth of , though it is unknown if that is their limit (due to the cost involved in drilling to such depths). The main threat to their survival seems not to result from the pressure at such depth, but from the increased temperature. Judging from hyperthermophile organisms, the temperature limit is at about 120 °C (Strain 121 can reproduce at 121 °C), which limits the possible depth to 4-4.5 km below the continental crust, and 7 or 7.5 km below the ocean floor. Endolithic organisms have also been found in surface rocks in regions of low humidity (hypolith) and low temperature (psychrophile), including the Dry Valleys and permafrost of Antarctica, the Alps, and the Rocky Mountains.

==Metabolism and survival==
The metabolism of endolithic microorganisms is versatile; there have been found genes involved in sulphur metabolism, iron metabolism and carbon fixation in many endolithic communities. Whether they metabolize directly from the surrounding rock, or excrete an acid to dissolve it first is yet undetermined. According to Meslier &amp; DiRuggiero there are genes found in the endolithic community involved in nitrogen fixation. The Ocean Drilling Program found microscopic trails in basalt from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans that contain DNA. Photosynthetic endoliths have also been discovered.

As water and nutrients are sparse in the endolith&#x27;s surrounding environment, water limitation is a key factor in the capacity of survival of many endolithic microorganisms. Many of those microorganisms have adaptations to survive in low concentrations of water. Additionally, the presence of pigments, especially in cyanobacteria and some algae, such as; beta carotenes and chlorophyll help them to protect against dangerous radiation and act as a way to obtain energy. Another characteristic is the presence of a very slow reproduction cycle. Early data suggest some only engage in cell division once every hundred years. In August 2013, researchers reported evidence of endoliths in the ocean floor, perhaps millions of years old and reproducing only once every 10,000 years. Most of their energy is spent repairing cell damage caused by cosmic rays or racemization, and very little is available for reproduction or growth. It is thought that they weather long ice ages in this fashion, emerging when the temperature in the area warms.

==Ecology==

As most endoliths are autotrophs, they can generate organic compounds essential for their survival on their own from inorganic matter. Some endoliths have specialized in feeding on their autotroph relatives. The micro-biotope where these different endolithic species live together has been called a &quot;subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystem&quot; (&quot;SLiME&quot;), or &quot;endolithic systems&quot; within the subterranean lithic biome.

&quot;Endolithic systems&quot; are still at an early stage of exploration. In some cases its biota can support simple invertebrates, most organisms are unicellular. Near-surface layers of rock may contain blue-green algae but most energy comes from chemical synthesis of minerals. The limited supply of energy limits the rates of growth and reproduction. In deeper rock layers microbes are exposed to high pressures and temperatures.

==Endolithic fungi and algae in marine ecosystems==
Although it is possible that endolithic fungi could play an important role in the health of coral reefs, only limited research has been conducted on the distribution and diversity of marine endolithic fungi.

Endolithic fungi have been discovered in shells as early as the year 1889 by Edouard Bornet and Charles Flahault. These two French phycologists specifically provided descriptions for two fungi: &quot;Ostracoblabe implexis &quot; and &quot;Lithopythium gangliiforme&quot;. Discovery of endolithic fungi, such as &quot;Dodgella priscus&quot; and &quot;Conchyliastrum&quot;, has also been made in the beach sand of Australia by George Zembrowski. Findings have also been made in coral reefs and have been found to be, at times, beneficial to their coral hosts.

In the wake of worldwide coral bleaching, studies have suggested that the endolithic algae located in the skeleton of the coral may be aiding the survival of coral species by providing an alternative source of energy. Although the role that endolithic fungi play is important in coral reefs, it is often overlooked because much research is focused on the effects of coral bleaching as well as the relationships between Coelenterate and endosymbiotic Symbiodinia.

According to a study done by Astrid Gunther endoliths were also found in the island of Cozumel (Mexico). The endoliths found there not only included algae and fungi but also included cyanobacteria, sponges as well as many other microborers.

==Endolithic parasitism==
Until the 1990s phototrophic endoliths were thought of as somewhat benign, but evidence has since surfaced that phototrophic endoliths (primarily cyanobacteria) have infested 50 to 80% of midshore populations of the mussel species &quot;Perna perna&quot; located in South Africa. The infestation of phototrophic endoliths resulted in lethal and sub-lethal effects such as the decrease in strength of the mussel shells. Although the rate of thickening of the shells were faster in more infested areas it is not rapid enough to combat the degradation of the mussel shells.

==Endolithic fungi found in the eggs of Cretaceous dinosaurs==
Evidence of endolithic fungi were discovered within dinosaur eggshell found in central China. They were characterized as being “needle-like, ribbon-like, and silk-like.&quot;.

Fungus is seldom fossilized and even when it is preserved it can be difficult to distinguish endolithic hyphae from endolithic cyanobacteria and algae. Endolithic microbes can, however, be distinguished based on their distribution, ecology, and morphology. According to a 2008 study, the endolithic fungi that formed on the eggshells would have resulted in the abnormal incubation of the eggs and may have killed the embryos in infected eggs of these dinosaurs. It may also have led to the preservation of dinosaur eggs, including some that contained embryos.

==Relationship with astrobiology==
Endolithic microorganisms have been considered a model for the search for life on other planets by inquiring about what sort of microorganisms on Earth inhabit specific minerals, which helps to propose those lithologies as life detection targets on an extra-terrestrial surface such as Mars. Several studies have been carried out in extreme places that serve as analogs for Mars&#x27;s surface and subsurface, and many studies in geomicrobiology on Earth&#x27;s hot and cold deserts have been developed. In these extreme environments, microorganisms find protection against thermal buffering, UV radiation, and desiccation while living inside pores and fissures of minerals and rocks. Life in these endolithic habitats might face similar stress due to the scarcity of water and high UV radiation that rule on modern Mars.

An excellent example of these adaptations is the non-hygroscopic but microporous translucent gypsum crusts, which are found as potential substrates that can mitigate exposure to UV radiation and desiccation and allow microbial colonization in hyper-arid deserts. In the same way, the ability to grow under high water stress and oligotrophic conditions confer to endolithic microorganisms to survive in conditions similar to those found on Mars. There is evidence of the past existence of water on the red planet; perhaps, these microorganisms could develop adaptations found in current deserts on the Earth. Furthermore, The endolithic structures are a good way to find ancient or current biological activity (biosignatures) on Mars or other rocky planets.

==In popular culture==
The manga and anime Land of the Lustrous revolves around characters composed of gems given life by endolithic inclusions.

<text>Acura is the American luxury and performance division of Japanese automaker Honda, based primarily in North America. The brand was launched on March 27, 1986, marketing luxury and performance automobiles. Acura sells cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, and Kuwait. The company has also previously sold cars in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Russia, and Ukraine. Plans to introduce Acura to the Japanese domestic market in the late 2000s did not eventuate due to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Acura was the first luxury division established by a Japanese automaker. The creation of Acura coincided with the introduction of a JDM Honda dealership sales channel, called Honda Clio, which sold luxury vehicles, joining previously established Honda Verno, followed by Honda Primo the following year. In its first few years of existence, Acura was among the best-selling luxury marques in the US, outselling established brands such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Though sales were down in the mid-to-late 1990s, the brand experienced a revival in the early 2000s, due to drastic redesigns and the introductions of new models.

In the late 1980s, the success of the company&#x27;s first flagship vehicle, the Legend, inspired fellow Japanese automakers Toyota and Nissan to launch their own luxury brands, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively. The 1990 launch of the NSX, a mid-engine exotic sports car, offered a reliable and practical alternative to exotic European sports cars, and introduced Honda&#x27;s VTEC variable valve timing system to the North American market. The 1993 Legend coupé featured Acura&#x27;s first use of a six-speed manual transmission mated to a Type II engine. In the late 1990s, Acura produced a Type R version of its compact Integra, which featured a reduced curb weight, a stiffer and lower suspension, and a high-output VTEC engine.

In the early 2000s, Acura introduced new models, including the company&#x27;s first all-original SUV, the MDX, and two models which replaced the Integra coupé and sedan, the RSX and TSX, respectively. Type-S versions of the RSX, CL, and TL were added to the brand&#x27;s lineup during that decade. Acura&#x27;s 2005 RL flagship introduced SH-AWD, a torque-vectoring all-wheel drive system. The 2007 RDX, a crossover SUV, featured the first North American use of a turbocharged Honda engine. A second generation NSX was launched in 2016 and features a twin-turbocharged mid-engine, a nine-speed dual-clutch transmission, and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD.

In 2024, Acura unveiled its new Performance EV Concept at the Monterey Car Week.

== Etymology and logo ==
The Acura name is derived from the Latin “acutus,” meaning &quot;to sharpen&quot;. The logo is derived from the caliper, a precise design tool representing the meticulous attention to detail that goes into every car.It also closely resembles Honda&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; logo, with the tops of the side verticals pinched together.

==History==

===1980s===
The brand was created around the same time as Japanese rivals Nissan and Toyota developed their respective Infiniti and Lexus premium brands. The Japanese government imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S. market, so it was more profitable for Japanese automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S.
Following a decade of research, Honda opened 60 new dealerships in North America by 1986, to support its Acura automobile division. Acura was the first Japanese luxury brand, introduced under the slogan, &quot;Acura. Precision Crafted Automobiles.&quot; Its initial offering consisted of two models: the executive class Legend and the compact class Integra, available as a five-door and three-door hatchback. The Legend was the result of Project XX, a joint venture Honda entered into with the UK&#x27;s Austin Rover Group. It was mechanically related to the Rover 800 series, while the Integra was an improvement of the Honda Quint hatchback.

The success of these models, particularly the Legend, led to competing Japanese luxury brand ventures (Toyota&#x27;s Lexus that began development in 1983 as the F1 project, and Nissan&#x27;s Infiniti who began development in 1985 by revising their Japan-only flagship Nissan President; in the late 1990s Mazda planned but never launched its own Amati luxury division). The goal of the Legend was to compete with rivals Toyota Crown and the Nissan Cedric and Gloria, but due to its 1986 introduction worldwide, Toyota, Nissan and other companies like Lincoln took notice of the markets reaction to the Legend and later the Vigor and offered vehicles that addressed the executive size car. Toyota introduced the Lexus ES, Nissan introduced the Infiniti J30 and Ford utilized the Taurus platform and named their new sedan the Lincoln Continental.
In 1987, Acura&#x27;s first full year of sales, they sold 109,000 cars with the flagship Legend sedan accounting for 55,000 sales and the rest were of the smaller Integra. By 1990, Acura was selling 138,000 vehicles, including 54,000 Legends, compared to Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s 78,000 cars and 64,000 each for BMW and Lexus.

===1990s===
In 1990, five years after the debut of the Legend and Integra, Acura introduced the NSX, a midship V6 powered, rear-wheel-drive sports car. The NSX, an acronym for &quot;New Sports eXperimental&quot;, was billed as the first Japanese car capable of competing with Ferrari and Porsche. This vehicle served as an &quot;image car&quot; for both the Honda and Acura brands, heralding the introduction of Honda&#x27;s VTEC technology. The NSX was the world&#x27;s first all-aluminum production car, and was also marketed and viewed by some as the &quot;everyday supercar&quot; thanks in part to its ease of use, quality and reliability, traits that were unheard of in the supercar segment at the time. With the release of the NSX, Acura introduced the &quot;A-badge&quot;, a stylized pair of calipers—a tool used for exacting measurements to imply that Acura vehicles are built to precise and demanding standards.
Despite a strong start in market acceptance for the Acura brand, sales suffered in the mid-to-late 1990s. Some critics attributed this decline in part to less inspiring designs, which were re-branded Japanese-spec Hondas, such as the Acura Vigor in 1992. Additionally, during this time Acura switched to an alphanumeric nomenclature formula, dropping the Legend, Vigor and Integra titles, following the lead of the NSX sportscar. The 1996 3.5 RL, which replaced the popular Legend, and the Vigor became the 2.5 TL and 3.2 TL, and was regarded by many as the epitome of this problem, namely because the alphanumeric designations were more anonymous than the former Legend, Vigor and Integra titles, which had grown into their own cult followings.

The parent company, Honda, was also feeling the results of the decline of the Japanese economy, due to the Japanese asset price bubble that took place during the 1990s and into the 2000s. This period is known in Japan as the Lost Decade.

During this time, the NSX also lost sales as Acura made few changes from its original 1990 trim. A year later, the Integra sedan was withdrawn from the Canadian market, replaced by the market-exclusive Acura 1.6 EL, a rebadged Honda Civic/Domani. The Integra sedan continued to be sold in the United States until 2001 (in name only, the model it was replaced with, the RSX, was simply a rebadged left-hand-drive version of the JDM DC5 Honda Integra).

Despite these letdowns, Acura gained prominence in the 1990s with a young group of customers: &quot;tuner&quot; enthusiasts. Parent company Honda&#x27;s reputation with this demographic as a maker of &quot;easy-to-tune&quot; and &quot;rev-happy&quot; engines rubbed off onto Acura, and the Integra became a popular tuner car.

===2000–2003===

Beginning around the year 2000, Acura experienced a rebirth which was catalyzed by the introduction of several redesigned models. The first of these models was the 1999 Acura 3.2 TL, an upscale sedan. Critics suggested that although 3.2 TL did not outdo its competition in any one area of luxury cars, it offered a well-rounded blend of sportiness and luxury. These characteristics, combined with the TL&#x27;s competitive price, proved very popular with consumers. Subsequent Acura models have followed a similar philosophy of offering much standard equipment and few options.
Another refreshed Acura introduced in the early 2000s was the MDX, a popular three-row crossover SUV based on the Honda Odyssey minivan. The MDX replaced the slow-selling SLX, which was little more than a rebadged Isuzu Trooper. The MDX was a car-like crossover SUV with limited off-road capability that catered to the demands of the luxury SUV market. It was given top honors by Car and Driver in its first comparison test against seven other SUVs. Other cars in Acura&#x27;s line-up during this time included the 3.2 TL, 3.2 CL, RSX (formerly the Integra hatchback), and the NSX. By the late 2000s, Acura had dropped the inclusion of engine displacement numbers in its vehicle designations, retaining a simpler, two- or three-letter designation instead (e.g. 3.5 RL became RL). The 1999-2003 TL have been plagued by transmission and other problems.

In 2001, a new coupe, badged as the RSX was introduced to the Acura line up. It was a replacement for the outgoing Integra. The RSX is a rebadged Honda Integra (DC5) from the Japanese market. As a result, the RSX is technically a new generation of the outgoing Integra. Much like the Integra, the RSX was a hit in the tuner market. However, at the end of 2006, the RSX was taken out of the Acura line up, subsequently in the Japanese market as well. It is not known why the RSX did not continue to be sold as the Integra in Japan, however, the reason that Acura gave for the cancellation of the RSX is that Acura wishes to move up in the luxury brand, thus cannot sell a car that is mostly driven by teenagers.

===2004–2006===
A new TL was introduced for the 2004 model year, with a V6 measured by the then-current SAE standards. The new TL increased sales dramatically to 70,943 American units in 2005.

Also around the same time the Acura TSX was introduced. It was essentially a re-badged European and Japanese market Honda Accord loaded with features. This model became the only 4-cylinder sedan in Acura&#x27;s line-up (with the exception of the Canadian market Acura CSX, which replaced the EL in 2006).

Acura&#x27;s new models—particularly the TL and TSX—were well received by the motoring press and became Acura&#x27;s top selling vehicles by then. The TSX was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot;″s Ten Best list from 2004 to 2006.


In 2005, a new RL was introduced with a V6, improved styling, and Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD), a system capable of sending almost all of the RL&#x27;s power to just one wheel in a turn. The second-generation RL appeared on &quot;Car and Driver&quot;″s Ten Best list for 2005, and also garnered an CNET.com &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot;. However in the midsize luxury segment, RL sales lagged far behind not only the best-selling German offerings but also Japanese contemporaries like the Lexus GS and Infiniti M. Honda Japan had set the RL&#x27;s initial price high, close to those with V8 engines, disappointing potential customers who perceived Acura as not being on par with its German rivals in brand equity and expected more value from the Japanese marque. The damage from Honda Japan&#x27;s alleged hubris was done, even though Honda Canada has since reduced the RL&#x27;s price.

In 2006 Acura introduced a compact crossover SUV which was based on its own unique unibody chassis called the RDX with models becoming available to U.S. consumers in August 2006. It is powered by a turbocharged 240-hp 4-cylinder engine and, like the RL, uses Acura&#x27;s SH-AWD system. A completely redesigned MDX became available in the fall of 2006 with a V6 engine and Super Handling All-Wheel Drive.
===2007–2013===

Acura re-introduced the TL Type-S for the 2007 model year. 2009 marked the all new TL and TSX models as well as a mid-year model update for the RL; all three made their debuts in the 2008 calendar year. Acura planned on redesigning the RL by 2011 as well as announced the creation of a brand new luxury crossover vehicle called the ZDX, previewed by the concept of the same name.

The ZDX was the first Acura designed in Acura&#x27;s design studio located at Torrance in Southern California. The ZDX was designed by Michelle Christensen and based on the Acura MDX using that vehicles 3.7 litre V6 engine (300 bhp) and SH-AWD system. It is also the first Acura to be completely built in North America. The production model of the ZDX made its debut in the Orange County Auto Show in Southern California on 15 October 2009. The concept behind the ZDX is that it is a &quot;four door coupe,&quot; and the design emphasis of the body of the car is like a &quot;pulled back slingshot.&quot; Another prominent design aspect of the ZDX is the wide rear shoulders above the rear wheels. The ZDX went on sale in December 2009.
Acura initially had plans for the third generation of RL to be a rear wheel drive V8 sedan for its flagship, but shelved the plans in the wake of the 2008 economic downturn.

Acura announced new TSX wagon in the 2010 New York Auto Show and went on sale in Fall of 2010. The wagon version of the TSX is based on the wagon version of the Euro-spec Honda Accord which has been in the European market for some time. However, Acura did not announce any plans for the third-generation RL.

For the 2010 model year the MDX models received some slight exterior changes and increased equipment levels. Mechanically the engine remained unchanged but the transmission was updated from the previous 5-speeds to 6-speeds including steering column mounted shift override paddles. This new transmission was shared with the ZDX.

In 2012, Acura introduced a new model called the ILX which replaced the Acura CSX in Canada and is based on the Honda Civic platform. The ILX was initially offered with three powertrain options: a 1.5L four cylinder electric hybrid shared with the North American Honda Civic Hybrid paired to a CVT transmission, a 2.0L 4 cylinder R20A1 paired to a 5 speed automatic transmission, or a 2.4L K24Z7 paired with a 6 speed manual transmission equipped with a limited slip differential identical to the 2013-2015 Honda Civic Si. It also unveiled the Acura RLX Concept, a replacement for the RL sedan, at the New York International Auto Show. The ILX went on sale in May 2012 in the United States as a 2013 model.
Also in 2012, Acura &quot;reinvented&quot; another model, The RDX concept. For the new model, Acura dropped the 4 cylinder turbo for a 3.5L V6. When the official 2013 Acura RDX was released, it was relatively similar to the concept but had changes in wheels, taillights, and some other cosmetics. A lot of this Acura looks like its brother the ILX. The 2013 RDX doesn&#x27;t have the SH-AWD system instead it has &quot;AWD with intelligent control&quot;, similar to the CR-V&#x27;s AWD system.

In 2013, Acura showed a 2014 Concept of the MDX. Shortly after, it was released to the public. The MDX competes with the Lexus RX, Audi Q7, and many others.
In December 2013, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Acura unveiled a Sport Hybrid SH-AWD version of the flagship RLX sedan. It has a 310-horsepower 3.5L V6 engine and a pair of electric motors (one for each axle) that generate a combined 377 horsepower through a new 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Acura technology firsts on the 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD also include an electronic gear selector that replaces the conventional, center console-mounted shift lever with an efficiently packaged push-button array allowing the driver to easily select the desired mode—Park, Drive and Reverse, as well as Sport and Normal driving modes. The new RLX Sport Hybrid will go on sale in mid-2014.

===2014–present===
In January 2014, at the Detroit Auto Show, Acura unveiled the all-new 2015 TLX sports sedan. This new vehicle replaced the soon to be discontinued TSX and TL sedans. The TLX in the 2.4-liter comes with Acura&#x27;s all new eight-speed dual clutch DCT transmission. Meanwhile, the high-end 3.5-liter V6 model came with the new nine-speed transmission and Super-Handling All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD). The TLX went on sale in the Summer of 2014.

In 2015, Acura redesigned the ILX for the 2016 model year. Now solely available with a 2.4L K24V7 engine and 8-speed dual clutch transmission (DCT) instead of the 2.0L R20A1 &amp; 5-speed automatic transmission, 2.4L K24Z7 6 speed manual transmission and hybrid electric options. Added is the signature Acura Jewel Eye LED headlights, LED taillights, updated wheels, suspension modifications, bumper redesign, and new packages such as AcuraWatch Package (includes adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation, lane keeping assist system, road departure mitigation, and forward collision warning) and A-Spec (sportier appearance).

Also redesigned is the 2016 RDX. Featured with the same 3.5L 6-speed automatic with some slight adjustments for efficiency and hp/torque boosts. The RDX gets the Acura Jewel Eye LED treatment as well. A new Advance Package is being offered with the inclusion of, parking sensors (front and rear), rain-sensing windshield wipers, auto-dimming side mirrors, remote start, ventilated seats, and foglights.

In 2017, Acura made considerations on opening an Indian branch.

==Racing==
Almost since its inception, Acura has been involved in American motorsports, specifically in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and IMSA GT Championship series. Starting in 1991, Acura reached an agreement with Comptech Racing to use the V6 motor of the Acura NSX in Comptech&#x27;s Camel Lights Spice prototype. Acura would go on to take the Lights championship in its initial year, including a class win at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Acura and Comptech would take the Lights championships again in 1992 and 1993, as well as another Daytona class win in 1992 and a class win at the 12 Hours of Sebring for 1993.
However a change in the IMSA rules would lead to the demise of the Camel Lights, and so Acura moved to touring car racing, joining Realtime Racing in the SCCA World Challenge with the NSX in 1996, winning the final two races of the season. In 1997, Acura added Acura Integras to the lower classes, and were successful in taking the championship in both of these classes. Realtime took the touring championship with the Integra again in 1998, and came within a few points of winning it again in 1999 only to lose it in the final race, then coming back to retake the title in 2000.

Although Realtime had abandoned the NSX program in 1998, the NSXs returned to the top class in 2001. Although the NSX squad suffered mechanical woes and were unable to take the title, the Integras of the touring class once again took the teams championship. By 2002, Acura replaced the aged Integra with the new Acura RSX in the final races of the season, scoring good finishes in their debut. At the same time, Acura finally retired the NSXs from the top GT class. The RSXs would later be joined by new Acura TSXs in 2004. Realtime continues to campaign the RSX and TSX in the SCCA Speed World Challenge. Acura also currently races RSXs and TSXs in the Grand American Road Racing Association&#x27;s KONI Challenge Series for touring cars.
At the Detroit Auto Show in 2006, Acura announced their plans to enter the American Le Mans Series with multiple teams of Le Mans prototypes in the LMP2 class starting in 2007 season. The cars would be purchased chassis from existing manufacturers, but use American-built Acura V8s (a first for Acura and Honda). Acura also announced their initiative to take the cars to the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008 and eventually move to the superior LMP1 class with cars built by Acura themselves in 2009. Later in 2006, Acura announced that the three factory teams would be Andretti Green Racing, Fernández Racing, and Highcroft Racing, and that the chassis would be built by Lola Cars of the UK and Courage Compétition of France.

The three Acura-powered prototypes debuted at the 2007 12 Hours of Sebring, which was the opening round of the ALMS season, and were successful in their debut. Andretti Green&#x27;s Acura took second place overall and first in the LMP2 class, while Fernández Racing took third overall, and Highcroft sixth, beating a series of established Porsche teams in their class. At the same time, Acura began development of their own chassis by heavily modifying their purchased Courage chassis. The cars now have been so radically changed from their original orientation that they are now named Acura ARX-01a. Acura will introduce evolved B-spec cars in the 2008 season, with Gil de Ferran launching a fourth Acura team in the ALMS.

In 2009, Acura produced its first LMP1 car, the Acura ARX-02a.

In 2010, Honda rebadged all Acura prototypes as Honda Performance Development (HPD) cars, and announced that all future prototypes (such as the HPD ARX-03) would be constructed under the HPD name.

Acura did not participate in motorsports again until 2013, where two Acura ILXs were unofficially entered in the 25 Hours of Thunderhill by Honda R&amp;D Americas designers and engineers (Team Honda Research West). The car would retire from the race due to engine problems.

The Acura ILXs returned to Thunderhill for the 2014 25-hour race. This time the car won its class and finished 8th overall. At the 2016 New York International Auto Show, Acura announced the GT3 version of the NSX, which began competition in 2017 with factory support in both WeatherTech SportsCar Championship&#x27;s GTD class and Pirelli World Challenge GT class, the latter replacing the Acura TLX. The car competes under Honda branding outside North America.

==Marketing==

The Acura logo, introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, is, according to Honda, a caliper — a design tool used for measuring that can also be interpreted as a skewed &quot;H&quot; (for Honda) or a stylised &quot;A&quot; (for Acura). The logo that was originally authorized without approval by Soichiro Honda did not contain the small horizontal bar joining the two vertical pillars—thus, it did not form the letter &quot;H&quot;. Soichiro Honda ordered the 5,000 badges already produced to be destroyed, including prying off the emblems applied to 309 cars already (US-spec Integra, Legend, and NSX models).

Acura&#x27;s current marketing slogan is &quot;Precision Crafted Performance.&quot; Recent models include Technology, Advance, Type-S, SH-AWD and A-Spec trim levels. Technology and Advance models typically come with the latest hi-tech features such as keyless start and a blind spot information system. Type-S and SH-AWD models are performance-oriented, with a substantial increase in horsepower compared to the lower trim levels. Some models, such as the TL, also combine trim levels (i.e. &quot;SH-AWD with Advance&quot;).

Acura began an association with Marvel Entertainment in 2010, upon release of the film &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, which featured a ZDX after the ending credits. On April 20, 2011, Acura and Marvel announced a promotional campaign, making Acura the official brand of Marvel&#x27;s fictional S.H.I.E.L.D. organization. Soon thereafter, several Acura models—such as the MDX, ZDX, RL, and TL—appeared in the films &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;. In the 2012 film, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) drove an exotic sportscar by Acura, made specifically for the film, rather than the Audi R8 he previously drove. It was rumored that the car spotted during filming was a concept for the second generation NSX, however, a different-looking 2012 Acura NSX Concept was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show, on 9 January 2012.

From 1995 to 2007, Acura sponsored two WTA Tour tennis tournaments, both named the Acura Classic.

In 2012, Acura was the presenting sponsor and official vehicle of the Sundance Film Festival.

Acura also has a &#x27;Mobility Program&#x27; that ensures drivers who are disabled are safe in their vehicles. The program offers cash reimbursement towards the cost of adaptive equipment for disabled drivers.

Acura was the official shirt sponsor of the Columbus Crew from 2017 to 2020.

<text>&quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; (originally published as &quot;The Mask of the Red Death: A Fantasy&quot;) is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1842. The story follows Prince Prospero&#x27;s attempts to avoid a dangerous plague, known as the Red Death, by hiding in his abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, hosts a masquerade ball in seven rooms of the abbey, each decorated with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure disguised as a Red Death victim enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. Prospero dies after confronting this stranger, whose &quot;costume&quot; proves to contain nothing tangible inside it. The guests also die in turn.

Poe&#x27;s story follows many traditions of Gothic fiction and is often analyzed as an allegory about the inevitability of death, though some critics advise against an allegorical reading. Many different interpretations have been presented, as well as attempts to identify the true nature of the eponymous disease. The story was first published in May 1842 in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and has since been adapted in many different forms, including a 1964 film starring Vincent Price. Poe&#x27;s short story has also been alluded to by other works in many types of media.

==Plot summary==
The story takes place at a abbey of the &quot;happy and dauntless and sagacious&quot; Prince Prospero. Prospero and 1,000 &quot;hale and light-hearted&quot; other nobles have taken refuge in this walled abbey to escape the Red Death, a terrible plague with gruesome symptoms that has swept over the land. Victims are overcome by &quot;sharp pains&quot;, &quot;sudden dizziness&quot;, and &quot;profuse bleeding at the pores&quot;, and die within half an hour. Prospero and his court are indifferent to the sufferings of the population at large. They intend to await the end of the plague in luxury and safety behind the walls of their secure refuge, having welded the doors shut to ensure no one enters or leaves.

One night, five or six months into this seclusion, Prospero holds a masquerade ball to entertain his guests in seven colored rooms of the abbey. Each of the first six rooms is decorated and illuminated in a specific color: blue, purple, green, orange, white, and violet. The last room is decorated in black and is illuminated by a scarlet light, &quot;a deep blood color&quot; cast from its stained glass windows. Because of this chilling pairing of colors, very few guests are brave enough to venture into the seventh room. A large ebony clock stands in this room and ominously chimes each hour, upon which everyone stops talking or dancing and the orchestra stops playing. Once the chiming stops, everyone immediately resumes the masquerade. As nightfall approaches, none of the guests enter the final room as it takes on a more eerie display and the additional chimes of the clock make them uneasy.

At the chiming of midnight, the revelers and Prospero notice a figure in a dark, blood-splattered robe resembling a funeral shroud. The figure&#x27;s mask resembles the rigid face of a corpse and exhibits the traits of the Red Death. Gravely insulted, Prospero demands to know the identity of the mysterious guest so they can hang him. The guests, too afraid to approach the figure, instead let him pass through the six chambers. The Prince pursues him with a drawn dagger and corners the guest in the seventh room. When the figure turns to face him, the Prince lets out a sharp cry and falls dead. The terrified revelers become enraged and surge into the black room and forcibly remove the mask and robe, only to find to their horror that there is nothing underneath. Only then do they realize the costume was the Red Death all along, having &quot;come like a thief in the night&quot;, and all of the guests contract and succumb to the disease. The final line of the story sums up, &quot;And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held dominion over all.&quot;

==Analysis==

Directly influenced by the first Gothic novel, Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, in &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; Poe adopts many conventions of traditional Gothic fiction, including the castle setting. The multiple single-toned rooms may be representative of the human mind, showing different personality types. The imagery of blood and time throughout also indicates corporeality. The plague may, in fact, represent typical attributes of human life and mortality, which would imply the entire story is an allegory about man&#x27;s futile attempts to stave off death (a commonly accepted interpretation). However, there is much dispute over how to interpret &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;; some suggest it is not allegorical, especially due to Poe&#x27;s admission of a distaste for didacticism in literature. If the story really does have a moral, Poe does not explicitly state that moral in the text.

Blood, emphasized throughout the tale, along with the color red, serves as a dual symbol, representing both death and life. This is emphasized by the masked figure – never explicitly stated to be the Red Death, but only a reveler in a costume of the Red Death – making his initial appearance in the easternmost room, which is colored blue, a color most often associated with birth.

Although Prospero&#x27;s castle is meant to keep the sickness out, it is ultimately an oppressive structure. Its maze-like design and tall and narrow windows become almost burlesque in the final black room, so oppressive that &quot;there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all&quot;. Additionally, the castle is meant to be an enclosed space, yet the stranger is able to sneak inside, suggesting that control is an illusion.

Like many of Poe&#x27;s tales, &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; has been interpreted autobiographically, by some. In this point of view, Prince Prospero is Poe as a wealthy young man, part of a distinguished family much like Poe&#x27;s foster parents, the Allans. Under this interpretation, Poe is seeking refuge from the dangers of the outside world, and his portrayal of himself as the only person willing to confront the stranger is emblematic of Poe&#x27;s rush towards inescapable dangers in his own life. Prospero is also the name of a central character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

===The &quot;Red Death&quot;===
The disease called the Red Death is fictitious. Poe describes it as causing &quot;sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores&quot; leading to death within half an hour.

The disease may have been inspired by tuberculosis (or consumption, as it was known then), since Poe&#x27;s wife Virginia was suffering from the disease at the time the story was written. Like the character Prince Prospero, Poe tried to ignore the terminal nature of the disease. Poe&#x27;s mother Eliza, brother William, and foster mother Frances had also died of tuberculosis. Alternatively, the Red Death may refer to cholera; Poe witnessed an epidemic of cholera in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1831. Others have suggested the pandemic is actually bubonic plague, emphasized by the climax of the story featuring the Red Death in the black room. One writer likens the description to that of a viral hemorrhagic fever or necrotizing fasciitis. It has also been suggested that the Red Death is not a disease or sickness at all but a weakness (like original sin) that is shared by all of humankind inherently.

==Publication history==

Poe first published the story in the May 1842 edition of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s and Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as &quot;The Mask of the Red Death&quot;, with the tagline &quot;A Fantasy&quot;. This first publication earned him $12 () . A revised version was published in the July 19, 1845 edition of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; under the now-standard title &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;. The original title emphasized the figure at the end of the story; the new title puts emphasis on the masquerade ball.

<text>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin. Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February2 repeatedly. The film also features Stephen Tobolowsky, Brian Doyle-Murray, Marita Geraghty, Angela Paton, Rick Ducommun, Rick Overton, and Robin Duke in supporting roles.

Rubin conceived the outline of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; in the early 1990s. He wrote it as a spec script to gain meetings with producers for other work. It eventually came to the attention of Ramis, who worked with Rubin to make his idea less dark in tone and more palatable to a general audience by enhancing the comedy. After being cast, Murray clashed with Ramis over the script; Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements, whereas Ramis concentrated on the comedic aspects. Principal photography took place from March to June 1992, almost entirely in Woodstock, Illinois. Filming was difficult, in part because of bitterly cold weather but also because of the ongoing conflict between Ramis and Murray.

&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was a box-office success on its release, earning over $105million to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1993. It also received generally positive reviews. Reviewers were consistent in praise for the film&#x27;s successful melding of highly sentimental and deeply cynical moments, and for the philosophical message beneath the comedy. It received multiple award nominations and won a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay. For all its success, the film marked the end of Ramis&#x27;s and Murray&#x27;s long collaborative partnership, which had produced films like &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980) and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984). After filming ended, the pair did not speak to each other until shortly before Ramis&#x27;s death in 2014. The film was a showcase for Murray; he had previously been seen primarily as a comic actor, and his performance led to more serious roles in critically acclaimed films.

In the years since its release, the film has grown in esteem; it is often considered to be among the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the greatest comedy movies ever. It has also had a significant effect on popular culture: the term &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, meaning a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, has become part of the English lexicon. Buddhist, Christian, and Jewish scholars have analyzed the film as a religious allegory. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is also credited with having ushered in mainstream acceptance of comedy films with fantasy-genre elements. In 2006, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was adapted into a 2016 musical, and inspired a 2019 video game sequel, &quot;Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son&quot;.

==Plot==
On February1, cynical television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss Western Pennsylvania. Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the &quot;hicks&quot; who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.
On February2, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn to Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; playing on the clock radio. He gives a half-hearted report on the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney, and although he desperately searches for a way to leave, he is forced to spend the night in the town.

The next morning, Phil wakes once more to &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; and the same DJ banter on the radio in his room at the Cherry Street Inn. Phil experiences the previous day&#x27;s events repeating exactly and believes he is experiencing déjà vu. He again unsuccessfully attempts to leave the town and retires to bed. When he awakes, it is again February2. Phil gradually realizes that he is trapped in a time loop of which no one else is aware. He confides his situation to Rita, who directs him to a neurologist, who in turn directs him to a psychologist; neither can explain his experiences. Phil gets drunk with locals Gus and Ralph and then leads police on a high-speed car chase before being arrested and imprisoned; the next morning, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn once again. 

Realizing that there are no consequences for his actions, Phil begins to spend loops indulging in binge eating, one-night stands, robbery, and other dangerous activities, using his increasing knowledge of the day&#x27;s events and the town&#x27;s residents to manipulate circumstances to his advantage. Eventually, he focuses on seducing the sweet-natured Rita, using the loops to learn more about and manipulate her. No matter what steps he takes, Rita rebuffs his advances, particularly when Phil tells her he loves her; Rita asserts that he does not even know her.

Phil gradually becomes depressed and desperate for a way to escape the loop. He commits suicide in a variety of ways, even kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil and driving them both off a cliff. Each time, he reawakens on February2 to &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. He eventually tries to explain his situation to Rita again, using his detailed knowledge of the day to accurately predict events. Convinced, Rita spends the rest of that day&#x27;s loop with Phil; she encourages him to think of the loops as a blessing instead of a curse. As they lie on the bed together at night, Phil realizes that his feelings for Rita have become sincere. He wakes alone on February2. Phil decides to use his knowledge of the loop to change himself and others: he saves people from deadly accidents and misfortunes and learns to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French. Regardless of his positive actions, however, he is haunted by his inability to prevent a homeless old man from dying of natural causes.

During one iteration of the loop, Phil reports on the Groundhog Day festivities with such eloquence that other news crews stop working to listen to his speech, amazing Rita. Phil continues his day helping the people of Punxsutawney. That night, Rita witnesses Phil&#x27;s expert piano-playing as the adoring townsfolk regale her with stories of his good deeds earlier that day. Impressed by his apparent overnight transformation, Rita successfully bids for him at a charity bachelor auction. Phil carves an ice sculpture in Rita&#x27;s image and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is trapped in the loop forever, he is finally happy because he loves her. They share a kiss and retire to Phil&#x27;s room.

Phil wakes the next morning to &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter has changed; it is now February 3. He tells Rita he wants to live in Punxsutawney with her.

== Production ==
===Concept and original draft===

The original idea for &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990. He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice&#x27;s book &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; (1985). Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless. He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries. He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change. He singled out men he deemed to be in arrested development, who could not outlive their adolescence.

Having recently sold his first script for what would become the thriller film &quot;Hear No Evil&quot; (1993), his agent prompted him to develop a &quot;calling-card&quot; script that he could use to gain meetings with producers. Rubin began work on his idea of a man changing over eternal life, but quickly realized that the idea was impractical because of the expense of depicting historical and future events. At this point, Rubin recalled a brief story concept he had written two years earlier that followed a man who woke every morning to find it was the same day repeating. Rubin married the two ideas to create the outline for &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. By portraying eternity as a repeating cycle instead of a straight line through history, he eliminated the production cost of constantly changing settings. He believed that the repetition also offered him more dramatic and comedic possibilities.

Rubin opened a calendar and picked the next nearest holiday, February2, Groundhog Day. He saw it as a date with story potential because it was a recognized holiday without much widespread attention. Rubin believed that people were vaguely aware of the holiday, on which a groundhog predicts the coming of spring. Even so, he believed few people outside Pennsylvania were aware that the actual festival takes place in the small town of Punxsutawney, something he became aware of through a writing job for a local phone company. Setting the story in Punxsutawney provided a small area in which to trap Phil Connors, while reporting on the event gave the character a reason to visit. Rubin took the main character&#x27;s name from Punxsutawney Phil. He hoped the film could become a perennial holiday favorite, like &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (1965).

Rubin spent eight weeks working on the story: seven making notes to define the rules and characters, and one writing the script. He struggled to establish a cause for the time loop, considering technological, magical, and celestial origins. He considered these methods interchangeable and felt the cause was unimportant and could detract from the story elements he wanted to focus on. Rubin said that the lack of explanation made Phil&#x27;s situation more relatable, as &quot;none of us knows exactly how we got stuck here either.&quot; He chose to begin the story , with Phil already caught in the time loop. The first scene included Phil waking to &quot;I Got You Babe,&quot; predicting the radio host banter and the actions of the hotel patrons, and attacking a pedestrian outside. Rubin thought this would intrigue an audience trying to understand how and why he is doing these things. He chose &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; because it used a lot of repeating lines and was about love, which he felt were thematically resonant aspects. He likened his original script to the 1949 British black comedy film &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, particularly the flippant way in which Phil&#x27;s multiple suicides are shown.

Rubin did not initially write the film as a broad comedy, considering it more whimsical. He found that the funnier elements were the easiest to think of; one of the earliest scenes he wrote was about Phil using his ever-increasing knowledge to seduce women. Loops were also dedicated to Phil seeing how far he could get outside of Punxsutawney; inevitably, he was always returned to the town. Even so, the script focused much more on Phil&#x27;s loneliness. He breaks the loop only after realizing that there are other lonely people and that he can do good deeds to make them happier. Scenes in the finished film happened much earlier in Rubin&#x27;s script, such as Phil driving over a cliff. The passage of time was also more distinct; Phil would track it by reading one page of a book per day, reaching his low point when he realizes he has run out of books. The original ending also featured a twist: Phil breaks his loop and then confesses his love to Rita. The perspective then becomes Rita&#x27;s; she rejects Phil&#x27;s advance because she is not ready for love and gets trapped in a loop of her own.

===Development===

Rubin&#x27;s agent used the script to arrange meetings with producers; although it did not sell, the meetings generated other work for him. In 1991, after his agent left the industry, Rubin distributed the &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; script in an effort to secure a new representative. It came to the attention of Richard Lovett at Creative Arts Agency. Lovett said that he could not represent Rubin, but passed the script to his own client, Harold Ramis.

By the early 1990s, Ramis had begun moving away from involvement in the anti-establishment and anti-institutional comedies, such as &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980) and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), that had defined his earlier career. While Ramis had successes in front of the camera and in creative roles like writing, his last directorial effort, &quot;Club Paradise&quot; (1986), had been a critical and commercial failure. He wanted to direct an unusual project and was particularly interested in comedies about redemption and discovering one&#x27;s purpose in life. Rubin was aware of Ramis&#x27;s previous work, having watched him in film and television.

Ramis admitted that he did not laugh while reading Rubin&#x27;s script. He was interested in the underlying spirituality and romance present, but thought it needed more humor. The pair discussed the core ideas in the script, raising parallels between it and the concepts of Buddhism and reincarnation. They also discussed whether it was ethical for Superman—a superhuman being with the power to save the lives of countless people and prevent disasters—to effectively waste time on adventures with his partner Lois Lane.

Rubin&#x27;s script became the subject of two offers: one arranged by Ramis through Columbia Pictures that would grant his project a higher budget, but at the cost of creative control, and a smaller independent studio that offered a lower budget of $3million, but would let Rubin retain his original concept. Rubin chose to go with Ramis&#x27;s deal. As expected, the studio wanted changes.

===Writing===
Rubin admitted to becoming defensive about the studio&#x27;s changes. He was concerned that they would remove what he saw as innovative plot points and turn it into a generic comedy film. Ramis supervised the rewrite, tasked with balancing Rubin&#x27;s desire for originality and the studio&#x27;s demand for a broad comedy. The pair loosely used the Kübler-Ross model of the five stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—as an outline. Ramis imagined himself in Phil&#x27;s situation and the things he would do and feel if in the same cycle of entrapment. The pair spent weeks revising the script. Ramis suggested that Rubin&#x27;s original ending, with Rita trapped in her own loop, be removed. He felt that audiences would dislike this as it offered no catharsis. Similarly, he felt it was important to retain the story&#x27;s darker elements, such as Phil&#x27;s suicides, as these compensated for the necessary sentimental moments.

Rubin delivered a fresh draft on February 2, 1991. He was contractually permitted to write another draft, but the studio had Ramis take over, bringing Rubin&#x27;s involvement to an end. Ramis took Rubin&#x27;s new draft and began his solo rewrite. He found the sentimentality and sincerity completely opposed to everything he had learned to do as a comedian, and deliberately tempered the sweeter moments with a cynical and grouchy tone. Ramis reorganized the script into a mainstream three-act narrative. He emphasized Phil&#x27;s smug attitude as a means of distancing himself from others, giving him a defined story arc as a classic comedic lead character deserving of his punishment. Ramis liked Rubin&#x27;s concept of starting with the loop in progress, but associate producer Whitney White suggested starting the film before the loop begins because she thought it would be more interesting for the audience to see Phil&#x27;s initial reaction to his predicament.

Ramis also removed Rita&#x27;s boyfriend, Max, and introduced (then removed) Phil&#x27;s executive producer, Gil Hawley. This draft featured more scenes focused on Phil&#x27;s sexual conquests and removed some content deemed more mean-spirited, like Phil asking Rita to be his &quot;love slave.&quot; The situation was reversed in the final version of the film, in which Rita buys Phil at the bachelor auction, claiming that she owns him. Phil&#x27;s journeys outside Punxsutawney were excised, as Ramis did not want the audience becoming too focused on what the rules of the loop were and felt that keeping the story within the town made it more claustrophobic. Phil&#x27;s expositional narration was removed as well. Also excised were more scenes of Phil&#x27;s later good deeds and the clever methods he used to prevent accidents while making the most efficient use of his time. For example, Phil puts a large rock in a road to stop a truck delivering fish, on which a restaurant patron would have later choked. Where Rubin&#x27;s original script had been more sermonic and deprecating, Ramis made the tone more optimistic. Two versions of a scene with Phil and Rita in a diner from Rubin&#x27;s original script and Ramis&#x27;s rewrite exemplify the shift of emphasis toward both Phil&#x27;s smugness and the romantic core of the film:

Rubin&#x27;s original script
PHIL (voice over) &quot;And me and Rita—together—was the most obvious thing in the world...&quot;
PHIL &quot;Have you ever felt like you were reliving the same day over and over again?&quot; 
RITA &quot;Like déjà vu?&quot; 
PHIL &quot;More like—déjà, déjà, déjà, déjà...&quot; 
RITA &quot;So, you still think you&#x27;ve been here before?&quot; &quot;Phil nods.&quot; 
RITA &quot;And how does this evening turn out?&quot; 
PHIL &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what I do know. Even in a day as long as this, even in a lifetime of endless repetition, there&#x27;s still room for possibilities.&quot;

Ramis&#x27;s rewrite
PHIL &quot;What are you looking for? Who&#x27;s your perfect guy?&quot;
RITA &quot;Well. First of all, he&#x27;s too humble to know he&#x27;s perfect.&quot; 
PHIL &quot;That&#x27;s me.&quot; 
RITA &quot;He&#x27;s intelligent, supportive, funny.&quot; 
PHIL &quot;Intelligent, supportive, funny. Me, me, me.&quot; 
RITA (thinking) &quot;He&#x27;s romantic and courageous.&quot; 
PHIL &quot;Me, me also.&quot; 
RITA &quot;He has a good body but he doesn&#x27;t have to look in the mirror every two minutes.&quot; 
PHIL &quot;I have a great body and I never look at it.&quot; 
RITA &quot;He&#x27;s kind and sensitive and gentle and considerate. And he&#x27;s not afraid to cry in front of me.&quot; 
PHIL &quot;This is a man we&#x27;re talking about, right?&quot; 

It was Ramis&#x27;s version that attracted Murray to the project, though Murray and Ramis immediately clashed over its tone. Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements; Ramis countered that it was meant to be a comedy. The studio was happier with Ramis&#x27;s draft, believing that his changes made it more appealing to audiences. Columbia Pictures rehired Rubin to assess the script and provide notes. Rubin returned the script with pages of honest and sometimes sarcastic notes. In response, Murray recommended fully rehiring Rubin to assist on the script.

The studio refused to greenlight the project without making explicit why Phil becomes trapped. Producer Trevor Albert described a Columbia executive saying, &quot;Why does the day repeat?... I like it... but I don&#x27;t understand why he gets stuck in this loop.&quot; Rubin had conceived of several causes for the loop, including a jilted lover placing a curse on Phil and a mad scientist&#x27;s invention malfunctioning. Albert and Ramis worked with Rubin to appease the studio, while agreeing to place the scenes too late in the shooting schedule to be filmed—and if forced to shoot it, to simply not include it in the film.

As the conflict between Ramis and Murray continued, Ramis sent Rubin to work on the script with Murray; he believed it was the only way to stop Murray&#x27;s constant early-morning phone calls. When Ramis called to check on their progress, Murray asked Rubin to pretend he was not there. The pair visited the 1992 Punxsutawney Groundhog Day festival to get a better understanding of the event, remaining discreet and not revealing the reason for their visit. They then spent weeks working together in New York City revising the script. Rubin found Murray&#x27;s more laid-back approach to writing &quot;frustrating.&quot; They were still working on the script a month before filming began, bringing it back closer to Rubin&#x27;s original.

Rubin and Ramis then collaborated on an additional rewrite. The pair worked on individual sections and then edited each other. Ramis then spent a few days refining it into the screenplay. Rubin recommended that they not include any references to the 1990s or any specific period to allow it to remain timeless. Rubin has said that the final film largely resembles his script. He did regret the loss of a scene between Phil and a 14-year-old boy, in which the child behaves like Phil did at the start of the film, contrasting with Phil&#x27;s character development by that point in the script. A few scenes were written but not filmed, including Phil praying at a church, gambling, and a scene Murray personally vetoed, of Phil stripped naked to force an elderly man out of a swimming pool. Although the script was complete, it continued to undergo changes during filming.

===Casting===

For the role of Phil Connors, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, and Michael Keaton were also considered. Hanks was Ramis&#x27;s first choice, but he rejected the offer, rationalizing that he was typecast portraying nice people, and the audience would be expecting his inevitable redemption, whereas Murray was &quot;such a miserable [son of a bitch] on- and off-screen&quot; that the outcome would be less predictable. Keaton said that the role of a &quot;wry, sardonic, glib&quot; character was a typical role for him, but that he simply did not understand the film. He later confessed regret in passing on the role. Phil was written as a younger man, but this was changed when it was determined that the appropriate comic actors were all older.

Murray and Ramis had a longstanding friendship and collaborative relationship, having worked together since 1974 on many projects and five films to great success, including &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979), &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984). Rubin did not write the character as particularly nasty, aiming for a normal person in an extranormal situation. In casting Murray, Phil was portrayed as more cynical, sarcastic, and detached, but not so malicious that audiences would no longer support him. Rubin wanted Kevin Kline for the part, believing Murray did not have the necessary acting ability. Ramis reassured Rubin, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. This is what Bill Murray can do. He can be that nasty and still make you like him.&quot; MacDowell agreed, saying &quot;He&#x27;s a jerk but he makes you laugh.&quot;

Albert auditioned comedians for the role of Rita, but determined that someone competing with Murray at comedy would be detrimental. Rita was not intended to trade witty comments with Phil, but instead to offer human warmth and intelligence. MacDowell was cast because she was thought to bring an effortless grace suited to Rita&#x27;s character. MacDowell tried to adapt to Murray&#x27;s natural improvisation in scenes. She believed that her character&#x27;s humor comes from her honesty, without being outlandish. Singer Tori Amos was also considered for the role.

Tobolowsky was hired after delivering an &quot;overwhelmingly obnoxious&quot; portrayal during his audition. Michael Shannon, who portrays prospective groom Fred, made his on-screen acting debut in the film. He spent much of the shoot in the background of the diner scene as they wanted all the actors in their places even if the camera was not focused on them. A live groundhog, given the name Scooter, was used to portray Punxsutawney Phil. Punxsutawney officials, upset that their town was not used for filming, refused to allow the real Punxsutawney Phil to appear in the film. The groundhog itself was not specially bred for use on film and was trapped in the wild near Illinois a few weeks before filming.
===Preproduction===
The production wanted to use a &quot;quintessential American town&quot; for location shooting, a place that did not look as if it was specific to any particular period. The Pennsylvania Film Commission provided location scouting tapes of Punxsutawney, but it became obvious that attempting to film in Punxsutawney would present difficulties, as the town had few ideal filming locations for the scripted scenes. Punxsutawney was also too isolated from the necessary amenities. The rural town was nearly from Pittsburgh, the nearest large city and did not offer sufficient accommodation for the entire cast and crew.

As a Chicago native, Ramis enjoyed filming in Illinois and knew the area could meet their needs. These included being closer to a major metropolitan area with access to highways, a winter aesthetic, and the ability to complete the production as quickly as possible. Ramis also wanted a main street like Punxsutawney&#x27;s. Location scout Bob Hudgins thought that Mineral Point, Wisconsin, could meet their requirements. During the scouting journey there, the team stopped in the city of Baraboo, Wisconsin, which happened to have a town square. The filmmakers could see the benefits of a town square over a main street. Ramis asked for something similar, but in closer proximity to Chicago.

By the time they arrived in Woodstock, Illinois, over 60 towns had been scouted. Hudgins was aware of Woodstock—a small town of approximately 25,000 people—from his work on the 1987 comedy film &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;. Though relatively remote, it offered the timeless quality the filmmakers sought. After Hudgins arranged for Ramis and Albert to view the town from the bell tower of the Woodstock Opera House, the decision was made to film in Woodstock. The town even came with a large pothole for Phil to step in.

Scouts initially found a forested preserve area outside of McHenry, Illinois, to film scenes at Gobbler&#x27;s Knob. The filmmakers later opted to position the site in the town square instead, recreating it to scale with detailed notes and videos, which significantly increased the effect on the town. Thousands of extras were on site across multiple takes. Several local businesses banded together to oppose the film&#x27;s presence, concerned about the influence the production would have on both the town square and storefronts over an indeterminate amount of time. Hudgins said that he was proud that badges with the number &quot;23&quot; on them—representing the 23 united businesses—had to be amended to &quot;14&quot; as he won several over. The city council was also split on whether to let it proceed. Three of the business owners sued Columbia Pictures after filming concluded for lost profits during the production. One of these cases was settled out of court; the outcomes of the other two are unknown.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on March 16, 1992, and concluded on June10, after 86 days. The budget was reported to be between $14.6million and $30million. Filming took place mainly in Woodstock, as well as on sets in Cary, Illinois, and Hollywood.

Weather conditions varied considerably during filming. Much of the shoot was conducted in conditions described as frigid and bitterly cold. Murray estimated that it was often . The conditions persisted until the end of May. Murray said that being outside for up to 12 hours a day left his skin feeling raw and made him irritable. Toward the end of the shoot, as summer began, fake snow was used to replicate the winter setting, and the actors continued to wear their winter gear despite the rising heat. Ramis could not decide on the weather conditions for the background of Phil&#x27;s and Ned&#x27;s encounters, so he shot their nine scenes multiple times in differing conditions. He settled on a gloomy setting to indicate a loop coming to an end. Weather conditions were a major factor in a two-week shoot for the car crash scene.

The shoot was also mired in tensions between Ramis and Murray; Ramis was focused on making a romantic comedy, in direct contrast to Murray&#x27;s desire for a more contemplative film. Murray was also in the middle of a divorce from Margaret Kelly. He was reportedly miserable throughout filming, demonstrated erratic behavior, threw tantrums, and often contradicted Ramis&#x27;s decisions. Ramis said that Murray constantly showed up late to set, calling his behavior &quot;just irrationally mean and unavailable.&quot; The two also disagreed about the script and other actors&#x27; performances. Shannon recounted how he believed he had upset Murray during an encounter. When Ramis heard about this, he made Murray publicly apologize to Shannon. Tobolowsky recounted how before their scene&#x27;s first take, Murray walked into a bakery and bought all the pastries, which he threw to the gathered onlookers, using Tobolowsky to help carry the load.
The script continued to change during filming. When Tobolowsky arrived for his first scene, he was handed a new script. He estimated that about a third of it was different from his original copy. For example, early in the film, Phil ends his first loop by breaking a pencil to see if it is repaired the following day. A more elaborate scene was filmed in which Phil spray-painted the walls of the room he wakes up in, destroyed objects, and gave himself a Mohawk hairstyle. The scene took three days to film and was costly; Ramis discarded it for something quieter, simpler, and less manic. The revised script also featured more of Phil&#x27;s misadventures, and his suicide attempts were set closer to the end. These scenes were moved forward in favor of a long third act showing Phil embracing life.

Murray endured physical discomfort for some scenes. To prepare for his step into the water-filled pothole, he wrapped his foot in cling wrap, neoprene, and two pairs of socks. As soon as the scene finished, he began an expletive-filled rant until the costume department dried his foot with hairdryers to avoid frostbite. For another scene, Murray asked MacDowell to really slap him, and Ramis instructed the children Murray confronts in a snowball fight to throw hard. During the scene in which Phil drives off with Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog bit Murray on the knuckle. Although Murray was wearing gloves, the bite broke the skin. During a later take, the groundhog bit him again, in the same spot.

Murray was hesitant about shooting the final scene in which Phil awakens next to Rita, as how or whether Phil was dressed would affect the tone of the revelation that he had escaped the time loop. Ramis polled the crew, who were split between Phil wearing the same clothes as the previous night and different clothes that suggested the pair had been intimate. A young female crew member served as the tiebreaker, ruling that they should be wearing the same clothes as &quot;anything else... will ruin the movie.&quot; As MacDowell&#x27;s and Murray&#x27;s characters venture outside the Cherry Street Inn in the film&#x27;s denouement, the scripted line &quot;Let&#x27;s live here&quot; is tempered by a Murray ad lib, &quot;We&#x27;ll rent to start.&quot;

Many locations in and around Woodstock were used in the production. The Woodstock Town Square features prominently. A bar in the former courthouse is used for a bar in Rita&#x27;s hotel. The Woodstock Opera House served as the exteriors of Rita&#x27;s hotel, and its tower is used for Phil&#x27;s suicide leap. The Cherry Street Inn was a private residence; the interior was shot on a set. Woodstock City Lanes was used for the bowling alley scene. The Tip Top Cafe, a setting for several scenes, was purpose-built for the film. Local demand later led to a real diner with a near-identical name at the same location. The bachelor auction where Phil demonstrates his personal transformation was filmed at the Woodstock Moose Lodge. The shots of Murray being nearly run over by a train were filmed at the nearby Illinois Railway Museum. The scene of Phil driving a truck over a cliff was shot in Nimtz Quarry in Loves Park, Illinois, about from Woodstock. A rail system was used to propel two vehicles into the quarry on separate takes, to give Ramis a choice of shots; pyrotechnics were employed to make each explode.
==Release==
===Context===
1993 was considered the year of the family film. This was seen as a response to criticism of Hollywood for overusing violence and sex in films, as well as a need for feel-good entertainment in a time of recession. As production costs rose, films pitched at both adults and children offered a greater chance being profitable both at the theater and in the ensuing home video rentals. By 1993, the three all-time highest-grossing films in North America were family-oriented: &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Home Alone&quot;. Family films encouraged repeat business and offered more opportunities to sell merchandise. Columbia Pictures chairman Mark Canton said that PG-rated films were much more likely to make over $100million, compared to adult-oriented fare. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission. The film was seen as a potential sleeper success.

&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was one of many family films released that year, including &quot;Free Willy&quot;, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, and the highly anticipated &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, which would go on to become the highest-grossing film to date. Not all releases that year were family-centric; it would become considered one of the greatest years for film across a range of genres. There were blockbusters like &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; and &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, critical favorites such as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and future classics, like &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.

The premiere of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; took place on February4, 1993, at the Fox Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. Murray did not attend the low-budget event, whose guests included comedian Rodney Dangerfield and actresses Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Mimi Rogers, and Virginia Madsen. $40,000 of the entry ticket sales profits were donated to the Scleroderma Research Foundation and Turning Point Shelter. A second premiere took place the following day in Crystal Lake, Illinois, followed by an auction of props and signed equipment from the film. All proceeds were donated to the Woodstock school district.

===Box office===
In North America, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; received a wide release on February 12, 1993, across 1,640 theaters. The film earned $12.5million—an average of $7,632 per theater. The film benefited from a four-day weekend due to the President&#x27;s Day holiday Monday. This increased its weekend total to $14.6million—enhancing the theater average to $8,934. This made it the second-biggest opening for a film released in winter, behind &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; ($18million) released the year before. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of romantic drama &quot;Sommersby&quot; ($9.9million), and adventure comedy &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; ($8.1million), both in their second week of release. Screenings of the film were approximately 80% sold out. 65% of audiences polled said they would &quot;definitely recommend&quot; it.

The film retained the number-one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $9.3million. In its third weekend, it dropped to second place with $7.6million, behind the debuting crime thriller &quot;Falling Down&quot; ($8.7million). &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; remained in the top 10 grossing films for a further four weeks, earning a total of $57.6million. It spent the remainder of its run outside the top 10 apart from two brief resurgences—one during the long Easter weekend in mid-April where it rose to number 2, and approximately 15 weeks into its run, where it rose to number 7 after being released in low-price ticket theaters.

In total, the film earned an approximate box office gross of $70.9million. Though it did not break any records, the film was considered a success, if a modest one. It finished as the 10th highest-grossing film of 1993 behind &quot;Free Willy&quot; ($78million) and &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; ($84million). When accounting for films released at the end of 1993 that earned most of their box office in 1994, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; becomes the 14th highest-grossing film of 1993. Industry experts suggest that as of 1997, the box office returns to the studio—minus the theaters&#x27; share—was $32.5million. Outside of North America, the film is estimated to have earned a further $34.2million, giving it a cumulative worldwide gross of $105million and making it the 19th highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers gave it an average rating of &quot;B+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

It was seen as a significant change from the previous works of Murray and Ramis. Kenneth Turan appreciated it as a gentle, endearing, and smaller-scale film. Hal Hinson called it the best American comedy since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Tootsie&quot; (also featuring Murray). He said that &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; demonstrated Ramis&#x27;s capable comedic timing, and offered a clever plot without pretension. Critics compared it to a combination of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and the surreal science-fiction/horror television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (1959). Roger Ebert compared it to the Murray-starring Christmas-comedy &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988), featuring a similar transformation from selfish to selfless. He said that where that film offered a &quot;grim discontent,&quot; &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; offered optimism.

Critics agreed that the film had an obvious moral, but disagreed on its presentation. Desson Thomson found the film initially intriguing but believed it deteriorated into a Hollywood-style morality tale. In Turan&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; started as a traditional Hollywood story, but was earnest enough to convert the audience by the end, and had a &quot;romantic innocence&quot; that prevented it becoming formulaic. Hinson said that the moral core of the story was never presented in a way that insulted the viewer&#x27;s intelligence or required they sacrifice their cynicism to accept it. He continued that Phil evolves into a better version of himself, but never stops being a jerk. According to Janet Maslin, the film balanced sentimentality and nihilism. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; appreciated that the film endorsed small town morals and their positive effect on Phil. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; argued that it appealed simultaneously to cynicism and optimism.

The tone was described as inconsistent, and the film poorly paced, some scenes going on too long. Owen Glieberman compared it unfavorably to another time-travel film, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), which he found more cleverly structured. He described some scenes as isolated comedy sketches rather than part of a larger narrative. Thomson said that the repetition of scenes worked against the film, making it seem as if no progress was being made. Hinson countered that minor alterations to the scenes kept them interesting as part of a &quot;brilliantly imaginative&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; script. Some reviewers said that the humor was often mild, eliciting small chuckles instead of outright hilarity, although Hinson found it to be &quot;wildly funny.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that it offered a range of comedy and satire, all tempered by the love story between Phil and Rita. Critics highlighted the deeper story behind the comedy. Ebert called it a comedy on the surface but with an underlying thoughtfulness. Maslin said that her initial impression was of a lightweight fare, but it became &quot;strangely affecting.&quot;

Murray was consistently praised for his performance. Critics were in agreement that his performance was essential to the film&#x27;s success by making Phil&#x27;s transformation believable. Gene Siskel wrote that any other actor could not have prevented the film from becoming too &quot;saccharine.&quot; Turan said that Murray&#x27;s natural gruffness and comedic barbs prevented over-sentimentality. Turan also appreciated the endearing performance by Murray compared to his more abrasive, past performances. Hinson said that Murray had never been funnier. He continued that Murray was a vital component in keeping the film&#x27;s optimism from seeming dishonest or manufactured. Hinson liked that even after Phil&#x27;s redemption, he retains a cynical edge. Glieberman believed that Murray&#x27;s indifference retains the audience&#x27;s attention, but added that while Murray was talented enough to play a redeemed person, it was not a good fit for him. Ebert found Murray significantly funnier as a sarcastic antagonist than the friendly protagonist.

Critics were enamored with MacDowell&#x27;s performance. Siskel said that she lit up the screen when she was on. Maslin called her a &quot;thorough delight,&quot; saying that MacDowell&#x27;s performance offered a comforting, comedic presence. Hinson said that the on-screen chemistry between MacDowell and Murray was &quot;otherworldly&quot; and that she was a perfect fit for comedy. Tobolowsky also received praise as a hilarious &quot;pest.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 1993 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the screenplay came runner-up for Best Screenplay, tying with &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. The same year, it won Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards. In a then-unprecedented move, in late 1993, Columbia Pictures sent over 4,500 members of the Academy Awards voting committee a custom box containing videotapes of nine of their eligible films. The campaign was estimated to have cost between $400,000 and $650,000. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was included among these nine films, but received no nominations at the 66th Academy Awards.

At the 1994 BAFTA Awards, Rubin and Ramis won the award for Best Original Screenplay. MacDowell won the award for Best Actress at the 20th Saturn Awards ceremony, where &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; also received nominations for Best Fantasy Film (losing to &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;), Bill Murray for Best Actor (losing to Robert Downey Jr. in &quot;Heart and Souls&quot;), Best Writing and Best Direction (losing both to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), and Best Costumes for Jennifer Butler (losing to &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;). At the American Comedy Awards, Murray and Elliott were nominated for, respectively, Funniest Actor and Funniest Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for Best Dramatic Presentation at the Hugo Awards, losing to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

==Post-release==

===Aftermath===

Despite its relative success, a sequel was ruled out by November 1993. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was one of the films credited with helping to reverse Columbia&#x27;s failures at the box office, alongside the 1992 films &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. Shortly after its release, author Richard A. Lupoff threatened legal action against the filmmakers, alleging the film copied his short story &quot;12:01 P.M.&quot; and its associated 1990 short film adaptation about a man stuck in a time loop. The case was never formally filed as the film&#x27;s production company refused to support legal action. Similarly, author Leon Arden attempted legal action, claiming the film plagiarized his novel &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, which he had unsuccessfully pitched as a script to Columbia Pictures, about a man repeating April 15. The judge ruled against Arden.

Murray initially hated the finished &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. In a 1993 interview, he said that he wanted to focus on the comedy and the underlying theme of people repeating their lives out of fear of change. Ramis wanted to focus on the redeeming power of love. Even so, Murray agreed that Ramis had ultimately been right to do so. The film marked the end of Ramis and Murray&#x27;s nearly 20-year long partnership that among other things, had created films like &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. After filming concluded, Murray stopped speaking to Ramis. He never contacted Ramis, and refused to speak about him in interviews. Ramis openly spoke about Murray, both criticizing him and discussing his dreams where the pair were once again friends. Some of their close acquaintances, including producer Michael Shamberg, speculated that Murray had grown disillusioned with the assumption that his best work only came in collaboration with Ramis, or that Ramis was responsible for Murray&#x27;s public persona. Ramis said that he could make Murray as funny as possible, and in return, Murray&#x27;s improvisational skills could save even the most lackluster of scripts.

Murray felt that &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; had given him an opportunity to showcase a different side of himself. He admitted that he was bothered by his perception that his previous films focused on jokes without offering a deeper subtext. Even so, he said that he had found solace in meeting the people entertained by his work. Ramis believed that Murray&#x27;s dramatic turns in films like &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003) revealed more about Murray than anything else. Speaking in 2009, Ramis said that he thought Murray had grown tired of being the manic, energetic person carrying a film, and wanted to explore his potential. Ramis reached out to Murray to cast him in his 2005 black comedy &quot;The Ice Harvest&quot;. Murray&#x27;s brother Brian declined on his behalf. When Ramis enquired further, Brian said that Murray never discussed Ramis. Except for a few brief exchanges at public events, the pair did not speak for nearly two decades. They reunited only in the final few months of Ramis&#x27;s life in 2014. Rubin said that Murray and his brother now speak fondly of Ramis.

Rubin was in high demand as a screenwriter but retained his desire to tell original stories and refused to tell a traditional Hollywood narrative arc, as he found defying the expected premise and structure the most interesting part. He said that studios wanted him to simply put his spin on a conventional story. Eventually, the offers stopped coming. He continued to write scripts, but none progressed. In a 2017 interview, Rubin admitted some regret that &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; remained his biggest success.

===Home media and rereleases===
&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was released on VHS in early September 1993. It debuted at number 11 on the VHS rental chart, rising to number 1 by the end of September, replacing &quot;Falling Down&quot;. It remained the number 1 rental until mid-October when it was knocked off the top spot by &quot;Point of No Return&quot; at number 2 and &quot;Aladdin&quot; at number 1. It was considered the most successful comedy release of late 1993.

The film was released on DVD in 1998. The 2002 &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD included the film&#x27;s trailers, an audio commentary by Ramis, and &quot;The Weight of Time&quot;—a behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of the film, featuring cast and crew interviews. Murray did not participate. A 15th-anniversary edition DVD was released in January 2008. The film was digitally remastered under Ramis&#x27;s supervision. This set included Ramis&#x27; audio commentary and &quot;The Weight of Time&quot;, and added an interview with Ramis, a short documentary on groundhogs, and deleted scenes. This version was later released on Blu-ray disc in 2009, with an additional picture-in-picture feature with Tobolowsky reprising his role as Ned to provide facts about the film.

To celebrate the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary in February 2018, a remastered 4k resolution version of the film was released in select theaters. In April 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented a special one-night screening of the remastered film at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California. The remastered version was also released as an Ultra HD Blu-ray disc, Blu-ray disc, and a digital download. It included the same extras as the 15th-anniversary edition.

To celebrate the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the film was released in select theaters for two days in February 2023, with one of those days being February 2, Groundhog Day.

==Analysis==
===Time loop duration===
The duration of Phil&#x27;s real-time entrapment in the time loop has been the subject of much discussion. Ramis once said that he believed the film took place over ten years. When a blogger estimated the actual length to be approximately nine years, Ramis disputed that estimate and his own. He replied that it takes at least 10 years to become good at an activity (such as Phil learning ice sculpting and to speak French) and &quot;allotting for the down-time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years.&quot; A similar estimate suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of study (just over a year&#x27;s worth of time) to become an expert in a field, and given the number of loops seen or mentioned on screen, and how long Phil could spend per day studying, that Phil spent approximately 12,400 days, or nearly 34 years, trapped in the loop. In Rubin&#x27;s original concept draft, Phil himself estimates that he has been trapped for between 70 and 80 years, having used books to track the passage of time.

Born to a Jewish family, Ramis had adopted a Buddhist lifestyle from his second wife, embracing some of its precepts. He said that based on Buddhist doctrine, it takes approximately 10,000 years for a soul to evolve to the next level. In 2005, Rubin said, &quot;it became this weird political issue because if you asked the studio, &#x27;How long was the repetition?&#x27;, they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Two weeks&#x27;. But the point of the movie to me was that you had to feel you were enduring something that was going on for a long time... For me it had to be—I don&#x27;t know. A hundred years. A lifetime.&quot; In his book &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, Ryan Gilbey thought the vagueness surrounding the length of the loop was one of the most remarkable elements of the film. Just as there is no justification for why or how Phil is caught in the loop, the length of time is only as long as it takes for Phil to become a better person.

===Thematic analysis===

The film has been interpreted in many ways by different groups. Rubin has said that he did not set out to write the film as a spiritual allegory. He simply wanted to tell a story about human life and periods when a person becomes trapped in a cycle that they cannot escape. He said it was not &quot;just about a man repeating the same day but a story about how to live. Whose life isn&#x27;t a series of days? Who doesn&#x27;t feel stuck from time to time?&quot; In the bowling alley scene, Phil asks two Punxsutawney residents if they understand what it is like to be stuck in a place where nothing they do matters. He is referring to his own situation, but the two men, trapped in their own small-town lives, know exactly what he means.

While Rubin and Ramis discussed several of the philosophical and spiritual aspects of the film, they &quot;never intended [it] to be anything more than a good, heartfelt, entertaining story.&quot; Murray saw the original script as an interpretation of how people repeat the same day over and over because they are afraid of change. Rubin added that at the start of the loop, it is the worst day of Phil&#x27;s life. By being forced to change who he is, to embrace the world around him, and each moment of his day, it becomes the best day of his life; the day he falls in love. In a 2017 interview, Murray said he believed &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; still resonated because it is about &quot;the idea that we just have to try again... it&#x27;s such a beautiful, powerful idea.&quot;

Rubin has been contacted throughout the years by different experts providing their own interpretations. It has been seen as a Christian allegory with Punxsutawney Phil representing Jesus Christ, an example of the Nietzschean concept of eternal return, the spirit of Judaism, and the essence of homeopathy. It has also been interpreted as an adaptation of the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus who is also condemned to an eternal, daily punishment. Others have found significance in the numbers present in the film. Ramis himself was fascinated by Rubin&#x27;s original draft and its concepts of reincarnation. The date of Groundhog Day also has implications. It is set between the end of winter—characterized in the film as a period of satire and the end of things—and spring—a season represented by comedy and connected with themes of renewal and redemption.

Buddhist leaders commended the representation of the ideologies of regeneration. Phil can be interpreted as a bodhisattva, someone who has reached the brink of Nirvana and returns to Earth to help others to do the same. His loops can represent saṃsāra, a cycle of suffering from which he must escape. In the Jewish faith, Phil&#x27;s escape or reward can be seen as him being returned to Earth to perform moral deeds or &quot;mitzvot&quot;—the precepts and commandments of God. In Christianity, his journey can be interpreted as a form of resurrection or a means of securing a place in heaven. In Falun Gong religious philosophy, the film has been interpreted as a message that the spiritual self cannot evolve until it learns from past mistakes. In Catholicism, Phil&#x27;s situation can be identified as a form of purgatory, escaped only by embracing selflessness. MacDowell said &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we had that kind of experience and learn something from it? We go through life and are not always conscious of it... whatever religion you want to base yourself in, that&#x27;s ultimately why we&#x27;re here.&quot; &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; can also be interpreted as a secular tale in which Phil is experiencing an existential crisis where primal self-indulgence is no longer satisfying, causing him to fall into a depression that he escapes by taking ownership of his own self-improvement; he then uses his improved persona to benevolently help others.

Phil initially compares himself to a god, declaring that as a weatherman, he makes the weather. After several loops, he comes to believe he is a god, asserting that omnipotence may be mistaken for having lived so long one simply knows everything. Using his knowledge he is able to manipulate events in his favor. The repetition gives Phil an opportunity to escape from his own narcissistic self-confinement. Unwilling to change himself, the means to do so are forced upon him. After constant rejection by Rita and his idea of love, Phil hits an emotional low and repeatedly commits suicide. At one point, he suggests that he has killed himself enough times to no longer exist. It is at this point, Ramis suggests, that Phil becomes ready to change.

It is only when Phil stops using the loops to indulge his own desires and instead uses them to selflessly help others that he is freed. In repeatedly failing to save the old homeless man, Phil is also forced to accept that he is not a god. Similarly, regardless of how much knowledge he gains about Rita, and despite his accomplishments learned throughout the loops, he is unable to impress her enough to earn her love. He wins her over only once he stops trying to do so, and instead demonstrates genuine care for others without fakery or self-interest, will likely reset, and it will have all been for naught. Only then does Rita return his affections. The aspects of Rita that Phil mocked at the start of the film have become qualities he admires and respects, and in turn, Phil receives Rita&#x27;s love not because he desires it, but because he has genuinely become the type of person that Rita could love. This demonstrates the redeeming power of love, something Ramis wanted to emphasize. For him, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; represents having the strength and knowledge to make a change when faced with the opportunity to repeat previous mistakes.

Rick Brookhiser argues that it is because Phil fully appreciates every facet of the day that he is rewarded by the day being taken from him. He said, &quot;loving life includes loving the fact that it goes.&quot; John Seamon said that where other films use memory as a means of reflection or escape, Phil effectively lives within his memories, repeating them indefinitely; he has no hope for a future because everything will reset. By remembering and appreciating new details, Phil is able to grow as a person and becomes the agent of his own change. Rubin said Phil will not return to his old ways after his experiences, but might suffer disappointment that no day will ever live up to his final, perfect February2, after which he essentially loses his superpowers.

==Legacy==

&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is considered one of the most beloved comedy films ever made, an all-time classic, and a pop culture touchstone. In 2020, &quot;Paste&quot; described it as having a &quot;mythic, permanent pop cultural status reserved for few films.&quot; The film&#x27;s success made Ramis a credible comedy director, opening up more creative opportunities for him. Over the rest of the 1990s, he would direct 1996&#x27;s &quot;Multiplicity&quot; (also starring MacDowell), 1999&#x27;s &quot;Analyze This&quot;, and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Bedazzled&quot;. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; also showcased Murray&#x27;s capabilities as an actor, changing perceptions of him as a comedian to a broad-ranged actor and credible romantic lead. His performance is seen as a transitioning point to later roles in serious films like &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998), his Academy Award-nominated performance in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, and &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012). Rubin started a blog in 2007 that featured fictional conversations between himself and Phil Connors, who had since retired to live on a mountainside near Taos, New Mexico. Rubin taught screenwriting at Harvard University for several years.

Its impact on Woodstock and Punxsutawney was lasting and significant. Since the film&#x27;s release, Woodstock has hosted its own Groundhog Day festivals. These have included groundhog Woodstock Willie, screenings of the film, and walking tours of filming locations. The town attracts approximately 1,000 tourists for its yearly event, which has featured appearances by Albert, Rubin, and Tobolowsky. Punxsutawney, which once drew only a few hundred visitors to its festival, has since attracted tens of thousands. The year following the film&#x27;s release, over 35,000 people visited the town for Groundhog Day. Residents appreciate the film&#x27;s impact on the town, but assert that their focus remains on Punxsutawney Phil and the long-lived festival. In Woodstock, plaques are positioned at key locations used in the film, commemorating moments including Phil meeting Ned, the pothole in which Phil trips, and the town square pavilion where Phil and Rita share a dance.

As of 2016, Rubin continued to receive mail from fans, philosophers, and religious leaders; their content ranged from simple letters to sermons and dissertations. He has spoken of psychiatrists who recommend the film to their patients, and addicts who have told him that it helped them realize they were trapped in a repeating cycle of their own. Some time after the film&#x27;s release, Murray changed his opinion about it. He called it &quot;probably the best work I&#x27;ve done,&quot; adding &quot;and probably the best work Harold will ever do.&quot; In 2018, Tobolowsky said &quot;I think [Murray&#x27;s] performance in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; will stand as one of the greatest comedic performances of all time... He is able to be both antagonist and protagonist at the same time in the same film. He’s everything that’s horrible and everything that’s wonderful... I think it’s gonna stand up as long as films are made.&quot; The city of Chicago made a proclamation on February 2, 2024, as &quot;Harold Ramis Day&quot;, in a ceremony joined by Murray, Ramis&#x27; widow Erica Mann Ramis, and other actors from the film.

===Critical reassessment===
&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Rotten Tomatoes assesses a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average rating of . The consensus reads, &quot;Smart, sweet, and inventive, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; highlights Murray&#x27;s dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.&quot; The film has a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it Ramis&#x27;s masterpiece. In 2005, as part of his &quot;The Great Movies&quot; series, Ebert raised his original score for the film from three stars to a full four stars. In this updated review, Ebert said that he had underestimated the film and noted that Murray&#x27;s performance was essential to making the film work. That same year, Jonah Goldberg called it one of the best films of the previous 40 years, positioning it alongside &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; as one of America&#x27;s most uplifting and timeless films. In 2009, literary theorist Stanley Fish listed it as one of the ten best American films. He wrote, &quot;The comedy and the philosophy (how shall one live?) do not sit side by side, but inhabit each other in a unity that is incredibly satisfying.&quot; It is listed in the 2013 film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, which says &quot;...Bill Murray gives what may be the best and warmest performance of his career in this genius comedy—arguably the best of the 1990s...&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; attributes its lasting appeal to its use of a classic redemption arc like Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and its refusal to explain why the loop occurs, making it less like a typical mainstream film.

In 2000, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; number 34 on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list recognizing the best comedy films. In 2005, the film&#x27;s screenplay was listed as the twenty-seventh greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years on the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s (WGA) 101 Greatest Screenplays list. In a 2008 AFI poll of 1,500 industry members, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was ranked as the eighth-best fantasy film. That same year &quot;Empire&quot; listed the film 259th on its list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. In 2014, a poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked it the 63rd-best film of all time. In 2015, the screenplay was listed as the third-funniest on the WGA&#x27;s 101 Funniest Screenplays list, behind &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1958) and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977). That same year, it was ranked the 71st-best American film by a BBC Culture poll of international film critics. In 2017, the BBC polled 253 critics (118 female, 135 male) from across 52 countries on the funniest film made. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; came fourth, behind &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.

Several publications have ranked it as one of the greatest comedy films of all time, including: number one by &quot;Empire&quot; (2019); number five by &quot;Time Out&quot;; number 10 by Rotten Tomatoes; number 11 by &quot;IGN&quot;; number 18 by &quot;Paste&quot;; number 23 by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;; and unranked by Film School Rejects and &quot;Vogue&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes also listed the film number 86 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch. Similarly, it has been ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1990s, including: number 4 by IndieWire; number 5 by &quot;Slate&quot;; number 11 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;; number 12 by &quot;ShortList&quot;; number 15 by &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;; number 28 by Rotten Tomatoes; number 41 by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;; number 55 by the British Film Institute; and unranked by &quot;Time Out&quot;.

===Cultural impact===

William Goldman in 1993 said &quot;I think &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is the one that will be—of all of the movies that came out this year, it&#x27;s the one that will be remembered in 10 years.&quot; The same year, Desson Thomson opined &quot;&quot;Groundhog&quot; will never be designated a national film treasure by the Library of Congress.&quot; In 2006, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

Several filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; or cited it as an inspiration in their own careers, including David O. Russell, Terry Jones, and Jay Roach. Roach called it the film that &quot;changed him.&quot; Gillian Wearing called it one of her favorite films, citing its unusual structure and intelligent philosophical message. The film&#x27;s success helped to legitimize the use of fantasy in mainstream comedy films, laying the groundwork for future fantasy comedies such as &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), and &quot;Click&quot; (2006).

The phrase &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; has become a common term to reference a repetitive, unpleasant, and monotonous situation. It is recognized by dictionaries under two definitions: the holiday itself, and &quot;a situation in which events are or appear to be continually repeated.&quot; The term&#x27;s use is such that it has been defined as a cliché to refer to a situation in this way. It has been invoked (sometimes inaccurately) by singers, sports stars, comedians, actors, politicians, archbishops, and former Guantanamo Bay detention camp inmates. Then-President Bill Clinton referenced the film in a 1996 speech to troops stationed in Bosnia. The term was used during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, to refer to the monotony of quarantine and isolation associated with attempts to stem the spread of the virus.

The narrative concept of someone trapped in a repeating segment of time can be traced back to 1904, and is a popular trope, particularly in science-fiction. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; was responsible for popularizing the idea to the general public. Time loops have since been used in several films (including &quot;Naken&quot; (2000), &quot;Source Code&quot; (2011), &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), &quot;Happy Death Day&quot; (2017) and its sequel, and &quot;Palm Springs&quot; (2020)), television shows (including &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;The X-Files&quot;), and video games (including &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;Outer Wilds&quot; and &quot;Deathloop&quot;). These narratives often involve a central flawed character who must evolve to escape their chronological imprisonment. The influence of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is such that TV Tropes refers to this narrative arc as the &quot;Groundhog Day Loop.&quot; Rubin noted that with his script, he &quot;stumbled upon a story with all the makings of a classic, so simple and true that it could be retold many different ways by many different storytellers.&quot; It has been referenced across a range of media, including the 1998 novel &quot;About a Boy&quot;, the music video for the Craig David song &quot;7 Days,&quot; and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Flip-Flop&quot;, that features a time loop on the planet Punxsutawnee. Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, Michael Swaim postulated that since &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; popularized the time loop narrative, it had increased in mainstream popularity in part due to the Flynn effect—a statement on the increasing IQ of the population—that meant audiences could easily follow the more complex narratives, and the desire for nostalgia in the postmodern era of the early 21st century.

On February 2, 2016, fans in Liverpool, England, gathered to watch the film repeatedly for 24 hours. Since February2 that year (apart from 2017), Sky Cinema has played the film on repeat for 24 hours. In 2018, the New York Museum of Modern Art debuted a series of films chosen by polling 35 literary and religious scholars, which started with &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. There was conflict between the scholars as so many of them wanted to write about the film for the presentation.

==Adaptations==

A sequel was ruled out shortly after the film&#x27;s release in 1993. Rubin also holds a story credit on the 2004 Italian remake of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, called &quot;È già ieri&quot; (translated as &quot;It&#x27;s Already Yesterday&quot;), and commonly known as &quot;Stork Day&quot;. When asked about a sequel in 2018, MacDowell said it would never happen because &quot;I know [Murray]. He&#x27;s not going to do it.&quot; Despite this, Murray, Tobolowsky, and Doyle-Murray reprised their roles in a commercial for the Jeep Gladiator played during Super Bowl LIV on February2, 2020. Filmed in Woodstock, the commercial recreates scenes from the film, and features Murray again trapped in a time loop. He uses the Jeep Gladiator to explore Punxsutawney alongside Punxsutawney Phil. Murray called it his first and last commercial. In April 2020, Jeep released a series of modified versions of the advert to promote social distancing during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Murray provided creative input on the edit.

In the years since the film&#x27;s release, Rubin had worked on a musical adaptation of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, partly out of boredom and partly because a musical was not covered by the rights he had signed over to Columbia. In 2003, Stephen Sondheim expressed interest creating a musical but this project was never realized. When Matthew Warchus and Tim Minchin approached Rubin in 2012, he had already developed a narrative outline, jokes, and a refined list of 12 songs. He had been unable to progress the idea further without a composer. Coming off the success of &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;, Warchus and Minchin collaborated with Rubin for several years to produce the &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; musical. The musical debuted in August 2016, at The Old Vic theatre in London to generally positive reviews. A Broadway version started running in 2017. The show was nominated in several categories at the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, winning Best Actor and Best New Musical. Murray attended a Broadway show in 2017, alongside Doyle-Murray and Rubin.

A video game narrative sequel was released in September 2019. &quot;&quot; was developed by Tequila Works and published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality for PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive. The game casts players as Phil&#x27;s son, Phil ConnorsJr., who has grown up in the shadow of his beloved father. PhilJr. becomes trapped in his own time loop in Punxsutawney and is forced to help others and improve himself to earn his freedom. It received mixed critical reviews.

<text>Since the Partition of British India in 1947 and subsequent creation of the dominions of India and Pakistan, the two countries have been involved in a number of wars, conflicts, and military standoffs. A long-running dispute over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism have been the predominant cause of conflict between the two states, with the exception of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which occurred as a direct result of hostilities stemming from the Bangladesh Liberation War in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

== Background ==
The Partition of India came in 1947 with the sudden grant of independence. It was the intention of those who wished for a Muslim state to have a clean partition between independent and equal &quot;Pakistan&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot; once independence came.

Nearly one third of the Muslim population of India remained in the new India.

Inter-communal violence between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims resulted in between 200,000 and 2 million casualties leaving 14 million people displaced.

Princely states in India were provided with an Instrument of Accession to accede to either India or Pakistan.

==Wars==

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947===
The war, also called the First Kashmir War, started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the Maharaja of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu would accede to India. Following partition, princely states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal Islamic forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign the Instrument of Accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India to receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949. India gained control of about two-thirds of the state (Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly a third of The Pakistan controlled areas are collectively referred to as Pakistan administered Kashmir.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1965===

This war started following Pakistan&#x27;s Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. The hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and USA and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1971===

This war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle brewing in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Leader of East Pakistan, and Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in the declaration of Independence of Bangladesh from the state system of Pakistan. Following Operation Searchlight and the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India.
India intervened in the ongoing Bangladesh liberation movement. After a large scale pre-emptive strike by Pakistan, full-scale hostilities between the two countries commenced.

Pakistan attacked at several places along India&#x27;s western border with Pakistan, but the Indian Army successfully held their positions. The Indian Army quickly responded to the Pakistan Army&#x27;s movements in the west and made some initial gains, including capturing around of Pakistani territory (land gained by India in Pakistani Kashmir, Pakistani Punjab and Sindh sectors but gifted it back to Pakistan in the Simla Agreement of 1972, as a gesture of goodwill). Within two weeks of intense fighting, Pakistani forces in East Pakistan surrendered to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces following which the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh was created. The war resulted in the surrender of more than 90,000 Pakistani Army troops. In the words of one Pakistani author, &quot;Pakistan lost half its navy, a quarter of its air force and a third of its army&quot;.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1999===
Commonly known as the Kargil War, this conflict between the two countries was mostly limited. During early 1999, Pakistani troops infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) and occupied Indian territory mostly in the Kargil district. India responded by launching a major military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators. Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached by the infiltrators. According to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.
Fearing large-scale escalation in military conflict, the international community, led by the United States, increased diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to withdraw forces from remaining Indian territory. 
Faced with the possibility of international isolation, the already fragile Pakistani economy was weakened further. The morale of Pakistani forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties. The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers, an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas. Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Nawaz Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation and that Pakistan had lost the conflict. By the end of July 1999, organized hostilities in the Kargil district had ceased.
The war was a major military defeat for the Pakistani Army.

== Other armed engagements ==
Apart from the aforementioned wars, there have been skirmishes between the two nations from time to time. Some have bordered on all-out war, while others were limited in scope. The countries were expected to fight each other in 1955 after warlike posturing on both sides, but full-scale war did not break out.

===Siachen conflict===
In 1984, India launched Operation Meghdoot capturing all of the Siachen Glacier. Further clashes erupted in the glacial area in 1985, 1987 and 1995 as Pakistan sought, without success, to oust India from its stronghold.

=== Standing armed conflicts ===

====As proxies====

*Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir (1989–present): An insurgency in Kashmir has been a cause for heightened tensions. India has also accused Pakistan-backed militant groups of executing several terrorist attacks across India.
*Insurgency in Balochistan (1948–present): An insurgency in Balochistan province of Pakistan has also caused tensions recently. Pakistan has accused India of causing the insurgency with the help of ousted Baloch leaders, militant groups and terrorist organizations like the Balochistan Liberation Army. According to Pakistani officials these militants are trained in neighboring Afghanistan. In 2016, Pakistan alleged that an Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani forces during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan.
*Afghan conflict (1978–present): India and Pakistan had long been supporting opposing sides during the wars of Afghanistan, including during the Soviet–Afghan War and the civil wars from 1989 to 2001. In 2006, Pakistan has been accused by India for its involvement in terrorism in Afghanistan. In 2020, Pakistan accused India of trying to derail peace negotiations to end the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021).

=== Past skirmishes and standoffs ===
*1958 East Pakistan-India border clashes: were armed skirmishes between East Pakistan and India in August 1958. The clashes took place between troops of the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR) and the Indian Army in the village of Lakshmipur, located in Sylhet District.
*Operation Desert Hawk: A military operation executed by the Pakistan Armed Forces in the then disputed Rann of Kutch region.
* Operation Brasstacks: The largest of its kind in South Asia, it was conducted by India between November 1986 and March 1987. Pakistani mobilisation in response raised tensions and fears that it could lead to another war between the two neighbours.
* 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff: The terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament on 13 December 2001, which India blamed on the Pakistan-based terrorist organisations, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, prompted the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff and brought both sides close to war.
*2008 Indo-Pakistani standoff: a stand-off between the two nations following the 2008 Mumbai attacks which was defused by diplomatic efforts. Following ten coordinated shooting and bombing attacks across Mumbai, India&#x27;s largest city, tensions heightened between the two countries since India claimed interrogation results alleging Pakistan&#x27;s ISI supporting the attackers while Pakistan denied any official Pakistani involvement in the attacks. Pakistan placed its air force on alert and moved troops to the Indian border, voicing concerns about proactive movements of the Indian Army and the Indian government&#x27;s possible plans to launch attacks on Pakistani soil. The tension defused in a short time and Pakistan moved its troops away from the border.
*2016–2018 India–Pakistan border skirmishes: On 29 September 2016, border skirmishes between India and Pakistan began following reported &quot;surgical strikes&quot; by India against militant launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistani-administered Kashmir &quot;killing a large number of terrorists&quot;. Pakistan rejected that a strike took place, stating that Indian troops had not crossed the Line of Control but had only skirmished with Pakistani troops at the border, resulting in the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and the wounding of nine. Pakistan rejected India&#x27;s reports of any other casualties. Pakistani sources reported that at least eight Indian soldiers were killed in the exchange, and one was captured. India confirmed that one of its soldiers was in Pakistani custody, but denied that it was linked to the incident or that any of its soldiers had been killed. The Indian operation was said to be in retaliation for a militant attack on the Indian army at Uri on 18 September in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir that left 19 soldiers dead. In the succeeding days and months, India and Pakistan continued to exchange fire along the border in Kashmir, resulting in dozens of military and civilian casualties on both sides.
*2019 India–Pakistan border skirmishes: On 14 February 2019, a suicide attack on a convoy of India&#x27;s CRPF resulted in the death of at least 40 troops. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). 12 days later in February 2019, Indian jets crossed the international border to conduct air strikes on an alleged JeM camp in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. India claimed that it killed a very large number of militants belonging to JeM. Pakistan rejected to have suffered any losses. According to the sources and satellite imagery analysis, Indian air force appears to caused minimal damage to the buildings concerned, however, Pakistan had to close the site for one and a half month or 43 days before opened to media. The incidents escalated the tension between India and Pakistan. The following day, Indian and Pakistani air forces got locked on in an aerial engagement. Pakistan claimed to have shot down two Indian aircraft and capturing one pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. Pakistan military officials claimed that the wreckage of one Indian aircraft fell in Pakistan administered Kashmir while the other one fell in Indian administered Kashmir rumored to be a Sukhoi Su-30MKI. Meanwhile, Indian version was about loss a MiG-21 while shooting down a Pakistani F-16. The IAF also displayed remnants of an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile that they claimed could only be fired by F-16&#x27;s air planes. The missiles were said to have fired against and jammed by Su-30 by IAF. Pakistan rejected the Indian claim of an F-16 shot down. It initially released three or later on displayed all four air to air missiles of MiG-21 Bison with all missile seeker heads recovered intact from the wreckage however with mid-body of one of R-73 destroyed and claimed that non-of missiles were ever fired. Following the threats of a full-scale war, Abhinandan was released within two days. The Pentagon correspondent of Foreign Policy magazine, in a report claimed that Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident. Two senior U.S. defense officials told Foreign Policy that U.S. personnel recently counted Pakistan&#x27;s F-16s and found none missing. A Pentagon spokesman said they were not aware of any count being conducted, but the Pentagon did not put out any official statement on the matter. However, there have been no leaks countering the Foreign Policy report. India released the electronic footage of aerial engagement to re-assert its claims. Pakistani officials rejected radar images released by India. Stand off followed with intermittent firings across the LoC. Months later on 8 October, India on its Air Force Day, flew the same Su-30MKI &quot;Avenger 1&quot; aircraft in a flypast that Pakistan had claimed it had shot down during the air battle on 27 February.
*2020–2021 India–Pakistan border skirmishes: The standoff intensified when a major exchange of gunfire and shelling erupted between Indian and Pakistani troops in November 2020 along the Line of Control which left at least 22 dead, including 11 civilians. Pakistan&#x27;s foreign ministry said India had violated the ceasefire at least 2,729 times in 2020 which killed 21 Pakistani civilians and seriously injured 206 others. In February 2021, India and Pakistan released a joint statement, stating that after discussions over established hotlines, the two sides agreed to &quot;strict observance&quot; of all peace and ceasefire agreements with effect from midnight of 25 February 2021. Both sides agreed existing forms of hotline contact and border flag meetings would be utilized to resolve any future misunderstanding.

==Incidents==
* 1999 Pakistani
Atlantic shootdown: Pakistan Navy&#x27;s Naval Air Arm&#x27;s, Atlantic maritime patrol plane, carrying 16 people on board, was shot down by the Indian Air Force for alleged violation of airspace. The episode took place in the Rann of Kutch on 10 August 1999, just a month after the Kargil War, creating a tense atmosphere between India and Pakistan. Foreign diplomats noted that the plane fell inside Pakistani territory, although it may have crossed the border. However, they also believe that India&#x27;s reaction was unjustified. Pakistan later lodged a compensation claim at the International Court of Justice, accusing India for the incident, but the Court dismissed the case in a split decision ruling the Court did not have jurisdiction.
* The 2011 India–Pakistan border shooting incident took place between 30 August and 1 September 2011 across the Line of Control in Kupwara district/Neelam Valley, resulting in five Indian soldiers and three Pakistani soldiers being killed. Both countries gave different accounts of the incident, each accusing the other of initiating the hostilities.
* 2013 India–Pakistan border incident in the Mendhar sector of Jammu and Kashmir, due to the beheading of an Indian soldier. A total of 22 soldiers (12 Indian and 10 Pakistani) died.
*2014–2015 India–Pakistan border skirmishes: Started in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir due to killing of 1 soldier of Border Security Force and injured 3 soldiers and 4 civilians by Pakistan Rangers.

==Nuclear weapons==
The nuclear conflict between both countries is of passive strategic nature with nuclear doctrine of Pakistan stating a first strike policy, although the strike would only be initiated if and only if, the Pakistan Armed Forces are unable to halt an invasion (as for example in 1971 war) or a nuclear strike is launched against Pakistan, whereas India has a declared policy of no first use. According to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &quot;Nature Food&quot; in August 2022, a nuclear war between India and Pakistan could kill more than 2 billion indirectly by starvation during a nuclear winter.

* Pokhran-I (Smiling Buddha): On 18 May 1974 India detonated an 8-kiloton nuclear device at Pokhran Test Range, becoming the first nation to become nuclear capable outside the five permanent members of United Nations Security Council as well as dragging Pakistan along with it into a nuclear arms race. Pakistani prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had promised in 1965 that &quot;if India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own&quot;, and India&#x27;s Pokhran-I test spurred the Pakistani nuclear weapons program to greater efforts. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Chairman Munir Ahmed Khan said that the test would force Pakistan to test its own nuclear bomb.
* Kirana-I: In the 1980s a series of 24 different cold tests were conducted by PAEC, led by chairman Munir Ahmad Khan under extreme secrecy. The tunnels at Kirana Hills, Sargodha, are reported to have been bored after the Chagai nuclear test sites, it is widely believed that the tunnels were constructed sometime between 1979 and 1983. As in Chagai, the tunnels at Kirana Hills had been bored and then sealed and this task was also undertaken by PAEC&#x27;s DTD. Later due to excessive US intelligence and satellite focus on the Kirana Hills site, it was abandoned and nuclear weapons testing was shifted to the Kala Chitta Range.
* Pokhran-II (Operation Shakti): On 11 May 1998 India detonated another five nuclear devices at Pokhran Test Range. With jubilation and large scale approval from the Indian society came International sanctions as a reaction to this test, the most vehement reaction of all coming from Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan, which issued a stern statement claiming that India was instigating a nuclear arms race in the region. Pakistan vowed to match India&#x27;s nuclear capability with statements like: &quot;We are in a headlong arms race on the subcontinent&quot;.
* Chagai-I: (Youm-e-Takbir) Within half a month of Pokhran-II, on 28 May 1998 Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices to reciprocate India in the nuclear arms race. The Pakistani public, like the Indian, reacted with a celebration and a heightened sense of nationalism for responding to India in kind and becoming the only Muslim nuclear power. The day was later given the title Youm-e-Takbir to further proclaim such.
* Chagai-II: Two days later, on 30 May 1998, Pakistan detonated a sixth nuclear device completing its own series of underground tests with this being the last the two nations have carried out to date.

==Annual celebrations==

The nations of South Asia observe national and armed forces-specific days which originate from conflicts between India and Pakistan as follows:
* 28 May (since 1998) as Youm-e-Takbir (The day of Greatness) in Pakistan.
* 26 July (since 1999) as Kargil Vijay Diwas (Kargil Victory Day) in India.

* 7 September (since 1965) as Air Force Day (Youm-e-Fizaya) in Pakistan.
* 8 September (since 1965) as Victory Day/Navy Day (Youm-e-Bahr&#x27;ya) in Pakistan.
* 4 December (since 1971) as Navy Day in India.
* 16 December (since 1971) as Vijay Diwas (Victory Day) in India.
* 16 December (since 1971) as Bijoy Dibosh (Victory Day) in Bangladesh.

==Involvement of other nations==
*The USSR remained neutral during the 1965 war and played a pivotal role in negotiating the peace agreement between India and Pakistan. 
*The Soviet Union provided diplomatic and military assistance to India during the 1971 war. In response to the US and UK&#x27;s deployment of the aircraft carriers and , Moscow sent nuclear submarines and warships with anti-ship missiles in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, respectively.

<text>The Chess Olympiad is a biennial chess tournament in which teams representing nations of the world compete. FIDE organises the tournament and selects the host nation. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, FIDE held an Online Chess Olympiad in 2020 and 2021, with a rapid time control that affected players&#x27; online ratings.

The use of the name &quot;Chess Olympiad&quot; for FIDE&#x27;s team championship is of historical origin and is not connected to the Olympic Games.

==Birth of the Olympiad==
The first Olympiad was unofficial. For the 1924 Olympics an attempt was made to include chess in the Olympic Games but this failed because of problems with distinguishing between amateur and professional players. While the 1924 Summer Olympics was taking place in Paris, the 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad also took place in Paris. FIDE was formed on Sunday, July 20, 1924, the closing day of the 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad.
FIDE organised the first Official Olympiad in 1927 which took place in London. The Olympiads were occasionally held annually and at irregular intervals until World War II; since 1950 they have been held regularly every two years.


==Drug testing==
As a sporting federation recognized by the IOC, and particularly as a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conventions, FIDE adheres to their rules, including a requirement for doping tests, which they are obligated to take at the events such as the Olympiad. The tests were first introduced in 2002 under significant controversy, with the widespread belief that it was impossible to dope in chess. Research carried out by the Dutch chess federation failed to find a single performance-enhancing substance for chess. According to Dr Helmut Pfleger, who has been conducting experiments in the field for around twenty years, &quot;Both mentally stimulating and mentally calming medication have too many negative side effects&quot;. Players such as Artur Yusupov, Jan Timman and Robert Hübner either refused to play for their national team or to participate in events such as the Chess Olympiad where drug tests were administered. All 802 tests administered at the 2002 Olympiad came back negative. However, in the 36th Chess Olympiad in 2004, two players refused to provide urine samples and had their scores cancelled. Four years later, Vasyl Ivanchuk was not penalized for skipping a drug test at the 38th Chess Olympiad in 2008, with a procedural error being indicated instead.

In 2010, a FIDE official commented that due to the work of the FIDE Medical Commission, the tests were now considered routine. In November 2015, FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced they are working with WADA to define and identify doping in chess.

==Competition==
Each FIDE-recognized chess association can enter a team into the Olympiad. Each team is made of up to five players, four regular players and one reserve (prior to the tournament in Dresden 2008 there were two reserves).

Initially each team played all other teams but as the event grew over the years this became impossible. At first team seeding took place before the competition, with teams playing in preliminary groups and then finals. Later certain drawbacks were recognized with seeding and in 1976 a Swiss tournament system was adopted. Starting from 2008, the first criterion for determining ranking has been match points instead of board points. Teams score 2 points for a match win, 1 point for a drawn match and 0 points for a match loss.

The trophy for the winning team in the open section is the Hamilton-Russell Cup, which was offered by the English magnate Frederick Hamilton-Russell as a prize for the 1st Olympiad (London 1927). The cup is kept by the winning team until the next event, when it is consigned to the next winner. 

There is a separate women&#x27;s competition. Since 1976 it has been held at the same time and venue as the open event, with the two competitions comprising the Chess Olympiad. The trophy for the winning women&#x27;s team is known as the Vera Menchik Cup in honor of the first Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion. Judit Polgár from Hungary is the only player who won Chess Olympiad medals in both competitions – two gold medals in the women&#x27;s event (1988, 1990) and two silver medals in the open event (2002, 2014).

==Results (open event)==

* &quot;In 1976, the , other Communist countries and Arabic countries did not compete for political reasons.&quot; 
† &quot;FIDE organized the online olympiads in 2020 and 2021 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;

‡ &quot;Russia and India were subsequently declared joint winners after several Indian team members experienced connectivity issues due to a global outage of Cloudflare servers in 2020 Online Chess Olympiad.&quot;

§ &quot;The 2022 event was originally planned to be held in Minsk, Belarus, but it was rescheduled to Moscow, which originally was host of the 2020 Olympiad, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIDE made a statement in February 2022 that the tournament will not take place in Russia and will be shifted to Chennai, India.&quot;

==Gaprindashvili Cup==

This trophy was created by FIDE in 1997 and named after Nona Gaprindashvili, the former women&#x27;s World Champion (1962–1978). The trophy is awarded to the team that has the best overall performance across the open and women&#x27;s divisions.

Russia won this trophy six times, China – three times, India and Ukraine – two times each.

<doc id="142334" wikidata="Q6961612" url="?curid=142334" title="Names for Jewish and Christian holy books">
<text>This article distinguishes the various terms used to describe Jewish and Christian scripture. Several terms refer to the same material, although sometimes rearranged.

== Judaism ==
The Hebrew Bible comprises the Torah (the five books of Moses), the Neviim (the books of the Prophets), and the Ketuvim (the &quot;Writings&quot;).
The Hebrew Bible is also known as the Tanakh, an acronym from the initial Hebrew letters of these three words; and as the Mikra, meaning &quot;that which is read&quot;. 

Judaism has traditionally held that, along with the Torah, referred to as the &quot;Written Torah&quot;, God revealed a series of instructions on how to interpret and apply the Torah. The additional instructions were known as the Oral Torah. By the second century CE Jewish sages began writing down interpretations of the Bible; Orthodox Jews  consider these writings to embody the &quot;oral law.&quot; These writings take several forms:

* Talmud – An authoritative commentary on the Torah
** Mishnah – An analysis of the laws and meaning of the Bible, containing information from the oral law.
** Gemara – Rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah
* Tosefta – A set of teachings that in many ways are similar to the Mishnah. It may be an early commentary on the Mishnah, or it may be an independent attempt to codify the oral law.
* Braitot – A genre of rabbinic literature from the same time period as the Mishnah and Tosefta that no longer exists. The only quotes still extant from this literature are found as quotes within the Mishnah and Tosefta.
* Midrash – A genre of rabbinic literature that is an elaboration of, and commentary on, Biblical narrative.

== Christianity ==
For Christians, the Bible refers to the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Protestant Old Testament is largely identical to what Jews call &quot;the Bible&quot;; the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Old Testament (held to by some Protestants as well) is based on the prevailing first century Greek translation of the Jewish Bible, the Septuagint.

The Bible as used by Christianity consists of two parts:
* The Old Testament, largely the same as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible.
* The New Testament
** The four canonical Gospels. (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)
** The Acts of the Apostles recounts the early history of the Christian movement.
** The Epistles are letters to the various early Christian communities.
** The Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse, is a book of prophecy usually interpreted as regarding the Second Coming of Jesus.

Christians disagree on the contents of the Old Testament. The Catholic Church, the Orthodox Churches and some Protestants recognize an additional set of Jewish writings, known as the deuterocanonical books. They are not accepted as canonical by the Jews (although some ancient Jews appear to have accepted them) and by most of the Protestants, who consider them to be apocryphal.

There are also a number of other early Christian writings some individual Christians regard as scripture, but which are not generally regarded as such by the churches. These include the apocryphal gospels, such as the Gospel according to the Hebrews, the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.

== Differences ==
Jews regard the Old Testament part of the Christian Bible as scriptural, but not the New Testament. Christians generally regard both the Old Testament and the New Testament as scriptural.

The same books are presented in a different order in the Jewish Tanakh and the Christian Old Testament. The Torah/Pentateuch comes first in both. The Tanakh places the prophets next, then the historical material. The Christian Old Testament inverts this order, since the prophets are seen as prefiguring the coming of Christ.

Up to the first century CE, the books of the Tanakh were separate scrolls and their order was unimportant. The question of order arose with the invention of the codex. The order of the books is bound up with early Jewish-Christian polemics.

<doc id="142338" wikidata="Q17104660" url="?curid=142338" title="Network mapping">
<text>Network mapping is the study of the physical connectivity of networks e.g. the Internet. Network mapping discovers the devices on the network and their connectivity. It is not to be confused with network discovery or network enumeration which discovers devices on the network and their characteristics such as operating system, open ports, listening network services, etc. The field of automated network mapping has taken on greater importance as networks become more dynamic and complex in nature.

==Large-scale mapping project==
Images of some of the first attempts at a large scale map of the internet were produced by the Internet Mapping Project and appeared in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. The maps produced by this project were based on the layer 3 or IP level connectivity of the Internet (see OSI model), but there are different aspects of internet structure that have also been mapped.

More recent efforts to map the internet have been improved by more sophisticated methods, allowing them to make faster and more sensible maps. An example of such an effort is the OPTE project, which is attempting to develop a system capable of mapping the internet in a single day.

The &quot;Map of the Internet Project&quot; maps over 4 billion internet locations as cubes in 3D cyberspace. Users can add URLs as cubes and re-arrange objects on the map.

In early 2011 Canadian based ISP PEER 1 Hosting created their own Map of the Internet that depicts a graph of 19,869 autonomous system nodes connected by 44,344 connections. The sizing and layout of the autonomous systems was calculated based on their eigenvector centrality, which is a measure of how central to the network each autonomous system is.

Graph theory can be used to better understand maps of the internet and to help choose between the many ways to visualize internet maps. Some projects have attempted to incorporate geographical data into their internet maps (for example, to draw locations of routers and nodes on a map of the world), but others are only concerned with representing the more abstract structures of the internet, such as the allocation, structure, and purpose of IP space.

== Enterprise network mapping ==

Many organizations create network maps of their network system. These maps can be made manually using simple tools such as Microsoft Visio, or the mapping process can be simplified by using tools that integrate auto network discovery with Network mapping, one such example being the Fabric platform. Many of the vendors from the Notable network mappers list enable you to customize the maps and include your own labels, add un-discoverable items and background images. Sophisticated mapping is used to help visualize the network and understand relationships between end devices and the transport layers that provide service. Mostly, network scanners detect the network with all its components and deliver a list which is used for creating charts and maps using network mapping software. Items such as bottlenecks and root cause analysis can be easier to spot using these tools.

There are three main techniques used for network mapping: SNMP based approaches, active probing and route analytics.

The SNMP based approach retrieves data from Router and Switch MIBs in order to build the network map. The active probing approach relies on a series of traceroute-like probe packets in order to build the network map. The route analytics approach relies on information from the routing protocols to build the network map. Each of the three approaches have advantages and disadvantages in the methods that they use.

==Internet mapping techniques==
There are two prominent techniques used today to create Internet maps. The first works on the data plane of the Internet and is called active probing. It is used to infer Internet topology based on router adjacencies. The second works on the control plane and infers autonomous system connectivity based on BGP data. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds to maintain the connection.

===Active probing===
This technique relies on traceroute-like probing on the IP address space. These probes report back IP forwarding paths to the destination address. By combining these paths one can infer router level topology for a given POP. Active probing is advantageous in that the paths returned by probes constitute the actual forwarding path that data takes through networks. It is also more likely to find peering links between ISPs. However, active probing requires massive amounts of probes to map the entire Internet. It is more likely to infer false topologies due to load balancing routers and routers with multiple IP address aliases. Decreased global support for enhanced probing mechanisms such as source-route probing, ICMP Echo Broadcasting, and IP Address Resolution techniques leaves this type of probing in the realm of network diagnosis.

===AS PATH inference===
This technique relies on various BGP collectors who collect routing updates and tables and provide this information publicly. Each BGP entry contains a Path Vector attribute called the AS Path. This path represents an autonomous system forwarding path from a given origin for a given set of prefixes. These paths can be used to infer AS-level connectivity and in turn be used to build AS topology graphs. However, these paths do not necessarily reflect how data is actually forwarded and adjacencies between AS nodes only represent a policy relationship between them. A single AS link can in reality be several router links. It is also much harder to infer peerings between two AS nodes as these peering relationships are only propagated to an ISP&#x27;s customer networks. Nevertheless, support for this type of mapping is increasing as more and more ISP&#x27;s offer to peer with public route collectors such as Route-Views and RIPE. New toolsets are emerging such as Cyclops and NetViews that take advantage of a new experimental BGP collector BGPMon. NetViews can not only build topology maps in seconds but visualize topology changes moments after occurring at the actual router. Hence, routing dynamics can be visualized in real time. 
In comparison to what the tools using BGPMon does there is another tool netTransformer able to discover and generate BGP peering maps either through SNMP polling or by converting MRT dumps to a graphml file format. netTransformer allows us also to perform network diffs between any two dumps and thus to reason how does the BGP peering has evolved through the years. WhatsUp Gold, an IT monitoring tool, tracks networks, servers, applications, storage devices, virtual devices and incorporates infrastructure management, application performance management.

<text>Messier 100 (also known as NGC 4321 or the Mirror Galaxy) is a grand design intermediate spiral galaxy in the southern part of the mildly northern Coma Berenices. It is one of the brightest and largest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster and is approximately 55 million light-years from our galaxy, about 166,000 light-years in diameter. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781 and 29 days later seen again and entered by Charles Messier in his catalogue &quot;of nebulae and star clusters&quot;. It was one of the first spiral galaxies to be discovered, and was listed as one of fourteen spiral nebulae by Lord William Parsons of Rosse in 1850. NGC 4323 and NGC 4328 are satellite galaxies of M100; the former is connected with it by a bridge of luminous matter.

==Early observations==
After the discovery of M100 by Méchain, Charles Messier made observations of the galaxy depicting it as a nebula without a star. He pointed out that it was difficult to recognize the nebula because of its faintness. William Herschel was able to identify a bright cluster of stars within the &quot;nebula&quot; during his observations. His son John expanded the findings in 1833. With the advent of better telescopes, John Herschel was able to see a round, brighter galaxy; however, he also mentioned that it was barely visible through clouds. William Henry Smyth extended the studies of M100, detailing it as a pearly white nebula and pointing out diffuse spots.

==Star formation==
Messier 100 is considered a starburst galaxy with the strongest star formation activity concentrated in its center, within a ring – actually two tightly wound spiral arms attached to a small nuclear bar of radius: one thousand parsecs – where star formation has been taking place for at least 500 million years in separate bursts.

As usual on spiral galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, in the rest of the disk both star formation and neutral hydrogen, of which M100 is deficient compared to isolated spiral galaxies of similar Hubble type, are truncated within the galaxy&#x27;s disk, which is caused by interactions with the intracluster medium of Virgo.

==Supernovae==

Seven supernovae have been identified in M100:
* On 17 March 1901 Heber Curtis discovered SN 1901B (type I, mag. 15.6), at 110&quot;W and 4&quot;N from the galaxy&#x27;s nucleus.
* Heber Curtis discovered SN 1914A (type unknown, mag. 15.7) on 2 March 1914, at 24&quot;E and 111&quot;S from the galaxy&#x27;s nucleus.
* Milton Humason, with observations from early to mid 1960, discovered SN 1959E (type I, mag. 17.5), located 58&quot;E and 21&quot;S from the galaxy&#x27;s nucleus.
* On 15 April 1979, amateur astronomer Gus Johnson discovered SN 1979C, the first type II supernova found in the M100 galaxy. However, the star faded quickly, and later observations from x-ray to radio wavelengths revealed its remnant.
* SN 2006X (type Ia, mag. 15.3) was discovered by Shoji Suzuki and Marco Migliardi on 7 February 2006, two weeks before fading to magnitude 17.
* Jaroslaw Grzegorzek discovered SN 2019ehk (typeIb, mag. 16.5) on 29 April 2019. The supernova reached a peak magnitude of approximately 15.8.
* SN 2020oi (typeIc, mag. 17.28) was discovered by &quot;Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events&quot; (ALeRCE) on 7 January 2020.

<doc id="142340" wikidata="Q1473346" url="?curid=142340" title="Stained glass">
<text>Stained glass refers to coloured glass as a material or art and architectural works created from it. Although it is traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term &quot;stained glass&quot; to include domestic lead light and &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; created from glasswork, for example in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.

As a material &quot;stained glass&quot; is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. It may then be further decorated in various ways. The coloured glass may be crafted into a stained glass window, say, in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead, called cames or calms, and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow-coloured silver stain are often used to enhance the design. The term &quot;stained glass&quot; is also applied enamelled glass in which the colors have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.

Stained glass, as an art and a craft, requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages. In Western Europe, together with illuminated manuscripts, they constitute a major form of medieval visual art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained-glass windows have been described as &quot;illuminated wall decorations&quot;.

The design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the Bible, history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church – episodes from the life of Christ; within a parliament building – shields of the constituencies; within a college hall – figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home – flora, fauna, or landscape.

==Glass production==
During the late medieval period, glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of silica, the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as potash, soda, and lead can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as lime, are added to make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state. Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much of modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to flashed glass.

=== Cylinder or mouth-blown (&#x27;muff&#x27;) glass ===
Using a blow-pipe, a glass maker will gather a glob of molten glass that was taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The &#x27;gather&#x27; is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened, and the cylinder is then put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an annealer to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. &quot;Hand-blown&quot; or &quot;mouth-blown&quot; cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in the traditional fabrication of stained-glass windows.

===Crown glass===
Crown glass is hand-blown glass created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a potter&#x27;s wheel. The centrifugal force causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The centre of each piece of glass, known as the &quot;bull&#x27;s-eye&quot;, is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the pontil mark, a distinctive lump of glass left by the &quot;pontil&quot; rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.

===Rolled glass===
Rolled glass (sometimes called &quot;table glass&quot;) is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be &quot;double rolled&quot;, which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8&quot; or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called cathedral glass, but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.

===Flashed glass===
Architectural glass must be at least of an inch (3 mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of inch (3 mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed to create red stained glass is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming &quot;flashed glass&quot;.

A lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or abraded to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, hydrofluoric acid was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.

===Modern production of traditional glass===
There are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained-glass windows, in particular Tiffany glass and dalle de verre.

==Techniques==

===&quot;Pot metal&quot; and flashed glass===
The primary method of including colour in stained glass is to use glass, originally colourless, that has been given colouring by mixing with metal oxides in its melted state (in a crucible or &quot;pot&quot;), producing glass sheets that are coloured all the way through; these are known as &quot;pot metal&quot; glass. A second method, sometimes used in some areas of windows, is flashed glass, a thin coating of coloured glass fused to colourless glass (or coloured glass, to produce a different colour). In medieval glass flashing was especially used for reds, as glass made with gold compounds was very expensive and tended to be too deep in colour to use at full thickness.

===Glass paint===

Another group of techniques give additional colouring, including lines and shading, by treating the surfaces of the coloured sheets, and often fixing these effects by a light firing in a furnace or kiln. These methods may be used over broad areas, especially with silver stain, which gave better yellows than other methods in the Middle Ages. Alternatively they may be used for painting linear effects, or polychrome areas of detail. The most common method of adding the black linear painting necessary to define stained glass images is the use of what is variously called &quot;glass paint&quot;, &quot;vitreous paint&quot;, or &quot;grisaille paint&quot;. This was applied as a mixture of powdered glass, iron or rust filings to give a black colour, clay, and oil, vinegar or water for a brushable texture, with a binder such as gum arabic. This was painted on the pieces of coloured glass, and then fired to burn away the ingredients giving texture, leaving a layer of the glass and colouring, fused to the main glass piece.

===Silver stain===
&quot;Silver stain&quot;, introduced soon after 1300, produced a wide range of yellow to orange colours; this is the &quot;stain&quot; in the term &quot;stained glass&quot;. Silver compounds (notably silver nitrate) are mixed with binding substances, applied to the surface of glass, and then fired in a furnace or kiln. They can produce a range of colours from orange-red to yellow. Used on blue glass they produce greens. The way the glass is heated and cooled can significantly affect the colours produced by these compounds. The chemistry involved is complex and not well understood. The chemicals actually penetrate the glass they are added to a little way, and the technique therefore gives extremely stable results. By the 15th century it had become cheaper than using pot metal glass and was often used with glass paint as the only colour on transparent glass. Silver stain was applied to the opposite face of the glass to silver paint, as the two techniques did not work well one on top of the other. The stain was usually on the exterior face, where it appears to have given the glass some protection against weathering, although this can also be true for paint. They were also probably fired separately, the stain needing a lower heat than the paint.

===&quot;Sanguine&quot; or &quot;Cousin&#x27;s rose&quot;===
&quot;Sanguine&quot;, &quot;carnation&quot;, &quot;Rouge Jean Cousin&quot; or &quot;Cousin&#x27;s rose&quot;, after its supposed inventor, is an iron-based fired paint producing red colours, mainly used to highlight small areas, often on flesh. It was introduced around 1500. Copper stain, similar to silver stain but using copper compounds, also produced reds, and was mainly used in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Cold painting===
&quot;Cold paint&quot; is various types of paint that were applied without firing. Contrary to the optimistic claims of the 12th century writer Theophilus Presbyter, cold paint is not very durable, and very little medieval paint has survived.

===Scratching techniques===
As well as painting, scratched sgraffito techniques were often used. This involved painting a colour over pot metal glass of another colour, and then before firing selectively scratching the glass paint away to make the design, or the lettering of an inscription. This was the most common method of making inscriptions in early medieval glass, giving white or light letters on a black background, with later inscriptions more often using black painted letters on a transparent glass background.

==&quot;Pot glass&quot; colours==
These are the colours in which the glass itself is made, as opposed to colours applied to the glass.

===Transparent glass===
Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained-glass windows. These additives include manganese dioxide which produces sodium permanganate, and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in New England. Selenium has been used for the same purpose.

===Green glass===
While very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of Iron(II) oxide which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with chromium it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make wine bottles.
The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass. Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields emerald green glass.

===Blue glass===

*In medieval times, blue glass was made by adding cobalt blue, which at a concentration of 0.025% to 0.1% in soda-lime glass achieves the brilliant blue characteristic of Chartres Cathedral.
*The addition of sulphur to boron-rich borosilicate glasses imparts a blue colour.
* The addition of copper oxide at 2–3% produces a turquoise colour.
* The addition of nickel, at different concentrations, produces blue, violet, or black glass.

===Red glass===
* Metallic gold, in very low concentrations (around 0.001%), produces a rich ruby-coloured glass (&quot;ruby gold&quot;); in even lower concentrations it produces a less intense red, often marketed as &quot;cranberry glass&quot;. The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.
* Pure metallic copper produces a very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally &quot;flashed&quot; (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.
*Selenium is an important agent to make pink and red glass. When used together with cadmium sulphide, it yields a brilliant red colour known as &quot;Selenium Ruby&quot;.

===Yellow glass===
*This was very often achieved by &quot;silver stain&quot; applied externally to the sheets of glass (see above).
* The addition of sulphur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulphides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. With calcium it yields a deep yellow colour.
* Adding titanium produces yellowish-brown glass. Titanium is rarely used on its own and is more often employed to intensify and brighten other additives.
* Cadmium together with sulphur results in deep yellow colour, often used in glazes. However, cadmium is toxic.
* Uranium (0.1% to 2%) can be added to give glass a fluorescent yellow or green colour. Uranium glass is typically not radioactive enough to be dangerous, but if ground into a powder, such as by polishing with sandpaper, and inhaled, it can be carcinogenic. When used with lead glass with a very high proportion of lead, it produces a deep red colour.

===Purple glass===

* The addition of manganese gives an amethyst colour. Manganese is one of the oldest glass additives, and purple manganese glass has been used since early Egyptian history.
* Nickel, depending on the concentration, produces blue, or violet, or even black glass. Lead crystal with added nickel acquires a purplish colour.

===White glass===

* Tin dioxide with antimony and arsenic oxides produce an opaque white glass, first used in Venice to produce an imitation porcelain. White glass was used extensively by Louis Comfort Tiffany to create a range of opalescent, mottled and streaky glasses.

==Creating stained-glass windows==

===Design===
The first stage in the production of a window is to make, or acquire from the architect or owners of the building, an accurate template of the window opening that the glass is to fit.

The subject matter of the window is determined to suit the location, a particular theme, or the wishes of the patron. A small design called a &quot;Vidimus&quot; (from Latin &quot;we have seen&quot;) is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model maquette may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.

A traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.

A full-sized cartoon is drawn for every &quot;light&quot; (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple tracery lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large cathedral might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.

===Selecting and painting the glass===

Each piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by &quot;grozing&quot; the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces. Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.

From 1300 onwards, artists started using &quot;silver stain&quot; which was made with silver nitrate. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as &quot;Cousin&#x27;s rose&quot; was used to enhance flesh tones.

In the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamelled glass. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.

A method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead came. This allows for the use of techniques such as Angel gilding and Eglomise to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.

===Assembly and mounting===

Once the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or mastic between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see Came glasswork.

Traditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with lead strips or, more recently, with copper wires. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called &quot;ferramenta&quot;. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.

==History==
===Origins===
Coloured glass has been produced since ancient times. Both the Egyptians and the Romans excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. Phoenicia was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres Sidon, Tyre and Antioch. The British Museum holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the Lycurgus Cup, which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the cameo glass Portland vase which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.

In early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced alabaster set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.

Evidence of stained-glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when Benedict Biscop imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at Monkwearmouth. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at Jarrow.

In the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at Raqqa, Aleppo and Damascus and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.

===In Southwest Asia===
The creation of stained glass in Southwest Asia began in ancient times. One of the region&#x27;s earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the Assyrian city of Nineveh, dating to the 7th-century BC. The &quot;Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna&quot;, attributed to the 8th century alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān, discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt. The &quot;Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna&quot; also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass. The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text.

Stained glass creation had flourished in Persia (now Iran) during the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736 A.D.), and Zand dynasty (1751–1794 A.D.). In Persia stained glass sash windows are called Orosi windows (or transliterated as Arasi, and Orsi), and were once used for decoration, as well as controlling the incoming sunlight in the hot and semi-arid climate. 
===Medieval glass in Europe===
Stained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the Middle Ages when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.

In the Romanesque and Early Gothic period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at Chartres Cathedral and at the eastern end of Canterbury Cathedral. As Gothic architecture developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the Perpendicular style in England and Rayonnant style in France.

Integrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or rose window, developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at Sainte-Chapelle, Paris and the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Eye&quot; at Lincoln Cathedral.

While stained glass was widely manufactured, Chartres was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.

===Renaissance, Reformation and Classical windows===
Probably the earliest scheme of stained-glass windows that was created during the Renaissance was that for Florence Cathedral, devised by Lorenzo Ghiberti. The scheme includes three ocular windows for the dome and three for the facade which were designed from 1405 to 1445 by several of the most renowned artists of this period: Ghiberti, Donatello, Uccello and Andrea del Castagno. Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the Life of Christ or the Life of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, St Stephen and St Lawrence. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.

In Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of Protestantism. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the Limoges factory, and in Italy at Murano, where stained glass and faceted lead crystal are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France. Nonetheless, the country still holds the largest set of Renaissance stained glass in its churches, particularly in the regions of Normandy and Champagne where there were vivid ateliers in many cities until the early 17th century with the stained glass painter Linard Gonthier being active in Troyes until 1642. There are 1042 preserved 16th-century windows in the Aube department alone.

At the Reformation in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII and the injunctions of Thomas Cromwell against &quot;abused images&quot; (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See Stained glass – British glass, 1811–1918 for more details.

In the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at Grote Sint-Jan Church, Gouda. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59 feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of Dirck Crabeth and his brother Wouter. Many of the original cartoons still exist.

=== In Latin America ===

Stained glass was first imported to Latin America during the 17th–18th centuries by Portuguese and Spanish settlers. By the 20th century, many European artists had begun to establish their own studios within Latin America and had started up local production. With these new local studios came inventive techniques and less traditional imagery. Examples of these more modern works of art are the Basílica Nuestra Señora de Lourde and the Templo Vótivo de Maipú both located in Chile.

===Revival in Great Britain and Ireland===

The Catholic revival in England, gaining force in the early 19th century with its renewed interest in the medieval church, brought a revival of church building in the Gothic style, claimed by John Ruskin to be &quot;the true Catholic style&quot;. The architectural movement was led by Augustus Welby Pugin. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained-glass window making.

Among the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were William Warrington and John Hardman of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included William Wailes, Ward and Hughes, Clayton and Bell, Heaton, Butler and Bayne and Charles Eamer Kempe. A Scottish designer, Daniel Cottier, opened firms in Australia and the US.

===Revival in France===

In France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the Sèvres porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.
In France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the French Revolution. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by Viollet-le-Duc. Many of France&#x27;s finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri Gèrente and André Lusson.
Other glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.

===Revival in Germany, Austria and beyond===
During the mid- to late 19th century, many of Germany&#x27;s ancient buildings were restored, and some, such as Cologne Cathedral, were completed in the medieval style. There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as Albrecht Dürer. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827. A major firm was Mayer of Munich, which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as &quot;Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.&quot;. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.

In the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as Carl Geyling&#x27;s Erben, which still exists today. Carl Geyling&#x27;s Erben completed numerous stained-glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an imperial and royal warrant of appointment from emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.

===Innovations in Britain and Europe===
Among the most innovative English designers were the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris (1834–1898) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833–1898), whose work heralds the influential Arts and Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849–1924), author of the classic craft manual &#x27;Stained Glass Work&#x27; (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898–1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London&#x27;s Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe. The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950), who was much influenced by Whall&#x27;s example, developed the Arts &amp; Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall&#x27;s pupil Alfred Child at Dublin&#x27;s Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.

Art Nouveau or Belle Epoque stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of Francis Chigot of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal leadlight designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

===Innovations in the United States===
J&amp;R Lamb Studios, established in 1857 in New York City, was the first major decorative arts studio in the United States and for many years a major producer of ecclesiastical stained glass.

Notable American practitioners include John La Farge (1835–1910), who invented opalescent glass and for which he received a U.S. patent on 24 February 1880, and Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933), who received several patents for variations of the same opalescent process in November of the same year and he used the copper foil method as an alternative to lead in some windows, lamps and other decorations. Sanford Bray of Boston patented the use of copper foil in stained glass in 1886, However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875–1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts &amp; Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the US, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8). Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D&#x27;Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis &amp; Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Many 19th-century firms failed early in the 20th century as the Gothic movement was superseded by newer styles. At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the Glass House in London set up by Mary Lowndes and Alfred J. Drury and An Túr Gloine in Dublin, which was run by Sarah Purser and included artists such as Harry Clarke.

A revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.

Other artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as dalle de verre, where the glass is set in concrete or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to Jean Gaudin and brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the Benedictine monk Dom Charles Norris OSB of Buckfast Abbey.

Gemmail, a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead cames to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.
Many famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably Picasso, have been reproduced in gemmail. A major exponent of this technique is the German artist Walter Womacka.

Among the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an Abstract art form were Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian. In the 1960s and 1970s the Expressionist painter Marc Chagall produced designs for many stained-glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include John Hayward, Douglas Strachan, Ervin Bossanyi, Louis Davis, Wilhelmina Geddes, Karl Parsons, John Piper, Patrick Reyntiens, Johannes Schreiter, Brian Clarke, Paul Woodroffe, Jean René Bazaine at Saint Séverin, Sergio de Castro at Couvrechef- La Folie (Caen), Hamburg-Dulsberg and Romont (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of Gabriel Loire at Chartres. The west windows of England&#x27;s Manchester Cathedral, by Tony Hollaway, are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.

In Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of Johan Thorn Prikker and Josef Albers, and the post-war achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. This group of artists, who advanced the medium through the abandonment of figurative designs and painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction, and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads, are described as having produced &quot;the first authentic school of stained glass since the Middle Ages&quot;. The works of Ludwig Schaffrath demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass. In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as Brian Clarke were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.

In the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain&#x27;s only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.

After the First World War, stained-glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.

In the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University&#x27;s Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program&#x27;s director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium. The &quot;Roots of Knowledge&quot; installation at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah is long and has been compared to those in several European cathedrals, including the Cologne Cathedral in Germany, Sainte-Chapelle in France, and York Minster in England. There are also contemporary stained glass artists in the US who are creating stained-glass windows based on grids, rather than recognizable images.

===Combining ancient and modern traditions===
==Buildings incorporating stained-glass windows==
===Churches===
stained-glass windows were commonly used in churches for decorative and informative purposes. Many windows are donated to churches by members of the congregation as memorials of loved ones. For more on the use of stained glass to depict religious subjects, see Poor Man&#x27;s Bible.

===Synagogues===
In addition to Christian churches, stained-glass windows have been incorporated into Jewish temple architecture for centuries. Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in the mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York&#x27;s Congregation Anshi Chesed. From the mid-20th century to the present, stained-glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture. Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts. As with churches, synagogue stained-glass windows are often dedicated by member families in exchange for major financial contributions to the institution.

===Places of worship===
===Mausolea===
Mausolea, whether for general community use or for private family use, may employ stained glass as a comforting entry for natural light, for memorialization, or for display of religious imagery.

===Houses===
Stained glass windows in houses were particularly popular in the Victorian era and many domestic examples survive from this time. In their simplest form they typically depict birds and flowers in small panels, often surrounded with machine-made &quot;cathedral glass&quot; which, despite what the name suggests, is pale-coloured and textured. Many houses of the 19th and early 20th centuries feature original leadlight windows, another popular form of window glass in domestic settings.

===Public and commercial buildings===
Stained glass has often been used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public and commercial places such as banks, retailers and railway stations. Public houses in some countries make extensive use of stained glass and leaded lights to create a comfortable atmosphere and retain privacy.

<text>Sandra Moore Faber (born December 28, 1944) is an American astrophysicist known for her research on the evolution of galaxies. She is the University Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and works at the Lick Observatory. She has made discoveries linking the brightness of galaxies to the speed of stars within them and was the co-discoverer of the Faber–Jackson relation. Faber was also instrumental in designing the Keck telescopes in Hawaii.

==Early life and education==
Faber studied at Swarthmore College, majoring in physics and minoring in mathematics and astronomy. She earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1966. She then earned her PhD in 1972 from Harvard University, specializing in Optical Observational Astronomy under the direction of I. John Danziger. During this time the only observatory open to her was the Kitt Peak National Observatory, which had inadequate technology for the complexity of her thesis.

==Personal life==
Faber married Andrew Leigh Faber, a fellow Swarthmore physics major one year her junior, on June 9, 1967. They have two daughters, Robin and Holly.

==Career and research==
In 1972, Faber joined the faculty of the Lick Observatory at University of California, Santa Cruz, becoming the first woman on staff. In 1976, Faber observed the relationship between the brightness and spectra of galaxies and the orbital speeds and motions of the stars within them. The law that resulted would become known as the Faber–Jackson relation, after herself and the co-author, graduate student Robert Jackson.

Three years later, Faber and collaborator John S. Gallagher published a paper collecting all of the evidence for the existence of dark matter that had been published at that point. In 1983, she published original research showing that dark matter was not composed of fast-moving neutrinos (&quot;hot dark matter&quot;) and that instead, it was likely composed of slow-moving particles yet to be discovered (&quot;cold dark matter&quot;).

Around 1984, Faber collaborated with Joel Primack, George Blumenthal, and Martin Rees to elucidate their theory of how dark matter was part of galaxy formation and evolution. This was the first proposal of how galaxies have formed and evolved from the Big Bang to today. While some details have been proven wrong, the paper still stands as the current working paradigm for structure information in the universe. She and her collaborators discovered high-speed galaxy flows.

In 1985, Faber was involved with the construction of the Keck Telescope and building the first wide-field planetary camera for the Hubble Space Telescope. UC Berkeley physicist Jerry Nelson designed the Keck telescope, but Faber helped to sell the idea of large optical telescopes all over the world. The Keck telescope is the second largest optical telescope in the world, with a 10-meter primary mirror of a novel type that consists of 36 hexagonal segments.
Sandra Faber co-chaired the Science Steering Committee, which oversaw the first-light instrument for Keck I. She also continued to insist on high optical quality for the primary mirror of the Keck I, and went on to work on the Keck II as well.

During the later 1980s, Faber got involved in an eight-year project called the &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; collaboration, which attempted to catalogue the size and orbital speeds of 400 galaxies. Though this goal was not met, the group developed a way to estimate the distance to any galaxy, which became one of the most reliable ways to measure the total density of the universe.

In 1990, she assisted with the on-orbit commissioning of the wide field planetary camera for the Hubble Space Telescope. She says this was one of the most exhilarating and well-known phases of her career. The optics of the Hubble were flawed, and Faber and her team helped to diagnose the cause as spherical aberration. In 1995, Faber was appointed University Professor at UCSC.

Faber was also the principal investigator of the Nuker Team, which used the Hubble Space Telescope to search for supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. One of her most recent works include the addition of a new optical spectrograph for the Keck II telescope, which saw its first light in 1996. The new addition would increase the Keck II&#x27;s power for observing far-away galaxies by 13-fold. She has also joined up with other scientists to create the CANDELS project, which is the largest survey of the universe taken by the Hubble Telescope.

At UCSC she focuses her research on the evolution of structure in the universe and the evolution and formation of galaxies. In addition to this, she led the development of the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck telescopes to obtain spectra of cosmologically distant galaxies. On August 1, 2012 she became the Interim Director of the University of California Observatories.

Sandra Faber was a co-editor of the &quot;Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot; with Ewine van Dishoeck from 2012 to 2021. She serves on the Board of Directors of Annual Reviews.

<text>Milan Vidmar (22 June 1885 – 9 October 1962) was a Slovenian electrical engineer, chess player, chess theorist, and writer. He was among the top dozen chess players in the world from 1910 to 1930 and in 1950, was among the inaugural recipients of the title International Grandmaster from FIDE. Vidmar was a specialist in power transformers and transmission of electric current.

==Early life, family, and education==
He was born in a middle-class family in Ljubljana, Austria-Hungary (now in Slovenia). He began to study mechanical engineering in 1902, and he graduated in 1907 from the University of Vienna. He got his doctor&#x27;s degree in 1911 from the Technical faculty in Vienna. The study of electrical engineering at the Technical faculty did not begin until 1904, so Vidmar had to take special examinations in the field basics.

Between 1912 and 1913 he worked at the famous Ganz Works in Budapest as the assistant of Ottó Titusz Bláthy, one of the inventors and foremost experts on transformers which in turn became Vidmar&#x27;s specialisation too.

He was a professor at the University of Ljubljana, a member of the Slovenian Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the founder of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Between 1928 and 1929 he was the 10th chancellor of the University of Ljubljana. In 1948 he established the Institute of Electrotechnics that now bears his name.

==Chess career==
Vidmar was also a top-class chess player, probably one of the best dozen players in the world from 1910 to 1930, all the while remaining an amateur. He was awarded the Grandmaster title by FIDE in 1950, when titles were introduced.

His successes include high places at some of the top chess tournaments of his time, e.g. sixth at Carlsbad 1907, third at Prague 1908, first at Gothenburg 1909 (the 7th Nordic Chess Championship), second at San Sebastián 1911 with Akiba Rubinstein behind José Raúl Capablanca, first at Budapest 1912, second at Mannheim 1914, first at Vienna and Berlin in 1918, second at Košice 1928, third at London 1922, shared first with Alexander Alekhine at Hastings 1925/26, third at Semmering 1926, fourth at New York 1927, fourth at London 1927, shared fifth at Carlsbad 1929, tied for 4–7th at Bled 1931, tied for 3–6th at Stuttgart 1939, second behind Max Euwe at Budapest 1940, first at Basel 1952.

Vidmar represented Yugoslavia in the Chess Olympiads of Prague 1931 (, 8½/16) and Stockholm 1935 (board one, 8½/14).
Vidmar became an arbiter, earning the title of International Arbiter from FIDE, and was chief referee for the 1948 World Chess Championship in The Hague/Moscow.

<doc id="142348" wikidata="Q1195520" url="?curid=142348" title="Diurnal motion">
<text>In astronomy, diurnal motion (, ) is the apparent motion of celestial objects (e.g. the Sun and stars) around Earth, or more precisely around the two celestial poles, over the course of one day. It is caused by Earth&#x27;s rotation around its axis, so almost every star appears to follow a circular arc path, called the diurnal circle, often depicted in star trail photography.

The time for one complete rotation is 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.09 seconds – one sidereal day. The first experimental demonstration of this motion was conducted by Léon Foucault. Because Earth orbits the Sun once a year, the sidereal time at any given place and time will gain about four minutes against local civil time, every 24 hours, until, after a year has passed, one additional sidereal &quot;day&quot; has elapsed compared to the number of solar days that have gone by.

==Relative direction==
The relative direction of diurnal motion in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere are as follows:
* Facing north, below Polaris: rightward, or eastward
* Facing north, above Polaris: leftward, or westward
* Facing south: rightward, or westward

Thus, northern circumpolar stars move counterclockwise around Polaris, the north pole star.

At the North Pole, the cardinal directions do not apply to diurnal motion. Within the circumpolar circle, all the stars move simply rightward, or looking directly overhead, counterclockwise around the zenith, where Polaris is.

Southern Celestial Hemisphere observers are to replace north with south, left with right, and Polaris with Sigma Octantis, sometimes called the south pole star. The circumpolar stars move clockwise around Sigma Octantis. East and west are not interchanged.

As seen from the Equator, the two celestial poles are on the horizon due north and south, and the motion is counterclockwise (i.e. leftward) around Polaris and clockwise (i.e. rightward) around Sigma Octantis. All motion is westward, except for the two fixed points.

==Apparent speed==
The daily arc path of an object on the celestial sphere, including the possible part below the horizon, has a length proportional to the cosine of the declination. Thus, the speed of the diurnal motion of a celestial object equals this cosine times 15° per hour, 15 arcminutes per minute, or 15 arcseconds per second.

Per a certain period of time, a given angular distance travelled by an object along or near the celestial equator may be compared to the angular diameter of one of the following objects:
* up to one Sun or Moon diameter (about 0.5° or 30&#x27;) every 2 minutes
* up to one diameter of the planet Venus in inferior conjunction (about 1&#x27; or 60&quot;) about every 4 seconds
* 2,000 diameters of the largest stars per second

Star trail and time-lapse photography capture diurnal motion blur. The apparent motion of stars near the celestial pole seems slower than that of stars closer to the celestial equator. Conversely, &quot;following&quot; the diurnal motion with the camera to eliminate its arcing effect on a long exposure, can best be done with an equatorial mount, which requires adjusting the right ascension only; a telescope may have a sidereal motor drive to do that automatically.

<text>Réseaux IP Européens (RIPE, French for &quot;European IP Networks&quot;) is a forum open to all parties with an interest in the technical development of the Internet. The RIPE community&#x27;s objective is to ensure that the administrative and technical coordination necessary to maintain and develop the Internet continues. It is not a standards body like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and does not deal with domain names like ICANN.

RIPE is not a legal entity and has no formal membership. This means that anybody who is interested in the work of RIPE can participate through mailing lists and by attending meetings. RIPE has a chair to keep an eye on work between RIPE meetings and to act as its external liaison. Rob Blokzijl, who was instrumental in the formation of RIPE, was the initial chair and remained in that position until 2014, when he appointed Hans Petter Holen as his successor. The RIPE community interacts via RIPE Mailing Lists, RIPE Working Groups, and RIPE Meetings.

Although similar in name, the RIPE NCC and RIPE are separate entities. The RIPE NCC provides administrative support to RIPE, such as the facilitation of RIPE meetings and providing administrative support to RIPE Working Groups. It was established in 1992 by the RIPE community to serve as an administrative body.

== History==
The name is a translation of the English title of a diagram to French by John Quarterman. This was presented in Special Session of RIPE 58.

The first RIPE meeting was held on 22 May 1989 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It brought together 14 representatives of 6 countries and 11 networks At the time European governments, standardisation bodies and telecommunications companies were pushing for the OSI standard and IP-based networks were seen as the wrong way to go. In the academic community (mostly nuclear and particle physics) there was a strong need to work together with colleagues across Europe and the United States. IP provided a standard to allow interconnection and cooperation, whereas the networks offered by the European telecommunications companies often completely lacked that.
RIPE as an organisation was established by the RIPE terms of reference, which were agreed on 29 November 1989. There were ten organisations intending to participate in the RIPE Coordinating Committee, along the lines defined by the RIPE Terms of Reference, though some still needed to make a formal decision. These organisations were: BelWue, CERN, EASInet, EUnet, GARR, HEPnet, NORDUnet, SURFnet, SWITCH and XLINK. At the same time task forces were established to facilitate the interconnection of European IP-networks in the following weeks and months. The four task forces were:
#Connectivity and Routing
#Network Management and Operations
#Domain Name System
#Formal Coordination

One of the results was a proposal on 16 September 1990 to establish the RIPE Network Coordination Centre (NCC) to support the administrative tasks in the RIPE community and the first RIPE NCC Activity Plan was published in May 1991.

RIPE asked RARE (one of the predecessors of TERENA) if they would provide the legal framework for the RIPE NCC. After a solicitation procedure, the RIPE NCC began in April 1992 with its headquarters in Amsterdam, Daniel Karrenberg as manager and only two other staff members. Initial funding was provided by the academic networks (RARE members), EARN and EUnet. The RIPE NCC was formally established when the Dutch version of the articles of association was deposited with the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce on 12 November 1997.

==Function==
Any document, proposal, procedure or policy that has been proposed and accepted by the RIPE community is published online in the RIPE Document Store.

The RIPE community develops and sets policies for the technical coordination of the Internet and the management and distribution of Internet resources (IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)) through an established, open, bottom-up process of discussion and consensus-based decision-making. The RIPE Policy Development Process (PDP) formally tracks input into and discussion on any policy proposed. The RIPE PDP is transparent and consensus-based. Anyone may suggest a new policy or a change to an existing one. Proposals are then discussed and accepted or rejected by the RIPE community according to the RIPE PDP guidelines.

RIPE meetings happen twice a year in different locations throughout the RIPE NCC service region. The meetings are five-day events in which Internet service providers (ISPs), network operators, government representatives, regulators and other interested parties gather to discuss relevant issues, developments and policies. RIPE Meetings are open to anyone, although registration is required.

The RIPE community has formed a number of RIPE Working Groups to deal with various issues and topics related to the work of RIPE NCC members and the general Internet community. Each of the RIPE Working Groups has a mailing list where topics or questions related to the working group can be discussed. The RIPE Working Groups meet twice a year in dedicated sessions at RIPE Meetings.

<text>A circumpolar star is a star that, as viewed from a given latitude on Earth, never sets below the horizon due to its apparent proximity to one of the celestial poles. Circumpolar stars are therefore visible from said location toward the nearest pole for the entire night on every night of the year (and would be continuously visible throughout the day too, were they not overwhelmed by the Sun&#x27;s glare). Others are called &quot;seasonal&quot; stars.

All circumpolar stars lie within a circumpolar circle whose size is determined by the observer&#x27;s latitude. Specifically, the angular measure of the radius of this circle equals the observer&#x27;s latitude. The closer the observer is to the North or South Pole, the larger its circumpolar circle. 

Before the definition of the Arctic was formalized as the region north of the Arctic Circle which experiences the Midnight sun, it more broadly meant those places where the &#x27;bear&#x27; constellations (Ursa Major, the Great Bear, and Ursa Minor, the Little Bear) were high in the sky. Thus the word &#x27;Arctic&#x27; is derived from the Greek (&quot;arktikos&quot;), &#x27;bearish&#x27;, from (&quot;arktos&quot;), &#x27;bear&#x27;.

== Explanation ==

As Earth rotates daily on its axis, the stars appear to move in circular paths around one of the celestial poles (the north celestial pole for observers in the Northern Hemisphere, or the south celestial pole for observers in the Southern Hemisphere). Stars far from a celestial pole appear to rotate in large circles; stars located very close to a celestial pole rotate in small circles and hence hardly seem to engage in any diurnal motion at all. Depending on the observer&#x27;s latitude on Earth, some stars – the circumpolar ones – are close enough to the celestial pole to remain continuously above the horizon, while other stars dip below the horizon for some portion of their daily circular path (and others remain permanently below the horizon).

The circumpolar stars appear to lie within a circle that is centered at the celestial pole and tangential to the horizon. At the Earth&#x27;s North Pole, the north celestial pole is directly overhead, and all stars that are visible at all (that is, all stars in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere) are circumpolar. As one travels south, the north celestial pole moves towards the northern horizon. More and more stars that are at a distance from it begin to disappear below the horizon for some portion of their daily &quot;orbit&quot;, and the circle containing the remaining circumpolar stars becomes increasingly small. At the Equator, this circle vanishes to a single point – the celestial pole itself – which lies on the horizon, and so all of the stars capable of being circumpolar are for half of every 24 hour period below the horizon. There, pole star itself will only be made out from a place of sufficient height.

As one travels south of the Equator, the opposite happens. The south celestial pole appears increasingly high in the sky, and all the stars lying within an increasingly large circle centred on that pole become circumpolar about it. This continues until one reaches the Earth&#x27;s South Pole where, once again, all visible stars are circumpolar.

The celestial north pole is located very close (less than 1° away) to the pole star (Polaris or North Star), so from the Northern Hemisphere, all circumpolar stars appear to move around Polaris. Polaris itself remains almost stationary, always at the north (i.e. azimuth of 0°), and always at the same altitude (angle from the horizon), equal to the observer&#x27;s latitude. These are then classified into quadrants.

Polaris always has an azimuth equal to zero. The pole&#x27;s altitude for a given latitude Ø is fixed, and its value is given by Ø. All stars with a declination less than 90° - Ø are not circumpolar.

== Definition of circumpolar stars ==
Whether a star is circumpolar depends upon the observer&#x27;s latitude. Since the altitude of the north or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer&#x27;s latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole is less than the absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer&#x27;s latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If the observer&#x27;s latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are circumpolar. Stars on the celestial equator are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.
&quot;A star with its polar distance approximately equal to or less than the latitude of the observer&quot;.

Whether a given star is circumpolar at the observer&#x27;s latitude () may be calculated in terms of the star&#x27;s declination (). The star is circumpolar if is greater than +90° (observer in Northern Hemisphere), or is less than −90° (observer in Southern Hemisphere).
Similarly, the star will never rise above the local horizon if is less than −90° (observer in Northern Hemisphere), or is greater than +90° (observer in Southern Hemisphere). Thus, Canopus is invisible from San Francisco and Louisville, Kentucky, if marginally visible from Fresno, Tulsa, and Virginia Beach.

Some stars within the far northern constellation (such as Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor) roughly north of the Tropic of Cancer (23° 26′ N) will be circumpolar stars, which never rise or set.

For British Isles observers, for example, the first magnitude stars Capella (declination +45° 59′) and Deneb (+45° 16′) do not set from anywhere in the country. Vega (+38° 47′) is technically circumpolar north of latitude 51° 13′ N (just south of London); taking atmospheric refraction into account, it will probably only be seen to set at sea level from Cornwall and the Channel Islands.

Stars in the far southern constellations (such as Crux, Musca, and Hydrus) roughly south of the Tropic of Capricorn (23° 26′ S) are circumpolar to typical points of observation beyond that tropic.

Stars (and constellations) that are circumpolar in one hemisphere are always invisible at the same latitude (or higher) of the opposite hemisphere, and these never rise above the horizon. For example, the southern star Acrux is invisible from most of the contiguous United States, likewise, the seven stars of the northern Big Dipper asterism are invisible from most of the Patagonia region of South America.

==Constellations==
A circumpolar constellation is a constellation (group of stars) that never sets below the horizon, as viewed from a location on Earth. As viewed from the North Pole, all fully visible constellations north of the celestial equator are circumpolar, and likewise for constellations south of the celestial equator as viewed from the South Pole. As viewed from the Equator, there are no circumpolar constellations. As viewed from mid-northern latitudes (40–50° N), circumpolar constellations may include Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and the less-known Camelopardalis, Lynx and Lacerta.

<text>The IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch was the world&#x27;s first mass-produced electronic calculator along with its predecessor the IBM 603. It was an electronic unit record machine that could perform multiple calculations, including division. It was invented and developed by Ralph Palmer, Jerrier Haddad and Byron Phelps. It was introduced by IBM in 1948.

It could read a punched card from a deck, do some calculations based on the wiring of its plugboard, and punch results onto the same card. A separate IBM 521 Card Read/Punch processed the cards and had its own plugboard which selected the columns to be read and those to be punched.

The 604 and a modified version, the 605, were used as components of the Card Programmed Electronic Calculators (CPC and CPC II). The 604 was also a component of the &quot;Test Assembly&quot;, a precursor to IBM&#x27;s early computers. The circuit module design and packaging was also used for the IBM 650, the world&#x27;s first mass-produced computer and a very popular computer during the 1960s.

An all-transistor version of the 604 was built and demonstrated in October 1954. Although it used over 2200 transistors as opposed to 1250 tubes in the original, it occupied only about half the volume, and used only 5% as much power. This was only an experimental machine, but its technology was used to build the IBM 608, which shipped in December 1957, and was the world&#x27;s first all-transistorized electronic calculator to be mass produced.

Most of the circuitry was based on modifications of circuit designs used in the earlier 603 Electronic Multiplier and was packaged in small replaceable pluggable units, each typically containing one miniature vacuum tube. A limited number of standardized circuit designs were used, which made the product more easily manufactured and serviced. The calculation unit contained 1,250 tubes.
Clock speed was increased from the 603&#x27;s rate of 35kHz to 50 kHz. The 604 performed fixed-point addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using BCD arithmetic.

Initial versions supported 40 program steps, and this was soon expanded to 60. Processing was still locked to the reader/punch cycle time, thus program execution had to complete within the time between a punched card leaving the read station and entering the punch station.

Considerable expectations for the future of the business rested on the 604, upon which a corresponding amount of planning talent had been invested. While initially IBM planned on selling 75 units, they eventually sold over 5600. In 1974, there were still over 400 IBM 604s still in use.

An IBM 604 is preserved at the American Computer Museum and another at the University of Amsterdam Computer Museum.

In the comic series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, two scientists work with a 604 to send Tintin, the main character of the comic series, to the moon.

<text>Fred Brathwaite (born August 31, 1959), more popularly known as Fab 5 Freddy, is an American visual artist, filmmaker, and hip hop pioneer. He is considered one of the architects of the street art movement. Freddy emerged in New York&#x27;s downtown underground creative scene in the late 1970s as a graffiti artist. He was the bridge between the burgeoning uptown rap scene and the downtown No Wave art scene. He gained wider recognition in 1981 when Debbie Harry rapped on the Blondie song &quot;Rapture&quot; that &quot;Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody&#x27;s fly.&quot; In the late 1980s, Freddy became the first host of the groundbreaking hip-hop music video show &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;.

==Career==
In the late 1970s, Freddy became a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group the Fabulous 5, known for painting the entire side of New York City Subway cars. Along with other Fabulous 5 member Lee Quiñones, under his direction they began to shift from street graffiti to transition into the art world and in 1979 they both exhibited in a prestigious gallery in Rome, Italy, Galleria LaMedusa. In 1980, he painted a subway train with cartoon style depictions of giant Campbell&#x27;s Soup cans, after Andy Warhol.

Freddy became a regular guest on Glenn O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s public access cable show &quot;TV Party&quot;. As a frequent attendant at the Mudd Club and a participant in seminal &quot;The Times Square Show&quot;, Freddy was a bridge between the New York uptown graffiti and early rap scene and the downtown No Wave art scene. &quot;I was bringing the whole music, hip-hop, art, break dancing, and urban cultural thing to the downtown table&quot;, he said.

In late 1980, Glenn O&#x27;Brien cast Freddy, along with fellow Lower East Side graffiti writer Quiñones, in the film &quot;New York Beat&quot; (later released as &quot;Downtown 81&quot;). The film showcased artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in his Lower Manhattan environment and the culture that surrounded it. Blondie lead singer Debbie Harry also appeared in the film and in early 1981, Freddy made a cameo in the Blondie music video for &quot;Rapture.&quot; As recounted in the 1999 TV documentary &quot;The Hip Hop Years&quot;, the &quot;Rapture&quot; video featured Freddy in a cameo role painting graffiti art in the background. (Grandmaster Flash, who was also name-checked in the song, did not show up on the day of the shoot, so Basquiat took his place behind the turntables). &quot;Rapture&quot; was the first hip hop video to be shown on MTV.

Freddy connected with New York underground filmmaker Charlie Ahearn, who he had met at &quot;The&quot; &quot;Times Square Show&quot;, and they began production on the film &quot;Wild Style&quot; (1983) in 1981, which showcased artist Quiñones in the Uptown, Manhattan, environment of the Bronx and the burgeoning hip-hop culture. The movie &quot;Wild Style&quot;, the first film to illustrate hip hop culture, grew from an idea Freddy had to refute the negative depiction of New York City&#x27;s urban youth and to link for the first time break dancing, rapping, DJing and graffiti under one umbrella or branches from the same tree. Freddy created the film&#x27;s original music, co-produced and ended up in one of the leading roles as the charismatic Bronx hip hop club promoter and former graffiti artist, Phade.

In April 1981, Freddy co-curated with Futura 2000 the graffiti-related art show Beyond Words, at the Mudd Club which contained their own work along with Basquiat, Rammellzee, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and others. This was the first time the many members of the Bronx hip hop scene had appeared in the downtown New York City art world. On his relationship with art dealers, Freddy said, They didn&#x27;t know me, but they had heard of graffiti. But they didn&#x27;t understand the importance and the significance of what happened because, see, really what this comes down to is that my background basically is that of a vandal. I vandalize public property ... . In the real world, in New York, what made graffiti what it is, was the marriage which was the placing of the individual&#x27;s mark on that blank surface. But that blank surface that the individual graffiti person tags on, belongs to someone. In May 1981, Freddy was booked on Henry Chalfant&#x27;s &quot;Graffiti Rock&quot; performance with Rock Steady Crew at Common Ground gallery in SoHo (not to be confused with Holman&#x27;s &quot;Graffiti Rock&quot; TV show pilot). The show was cancelled due to violence, but was rescheduled in October at another venue called The Kitchen.

After the Rock Steady Crew and Afrika Bambaataa were booked as the opening act for Bow Wow Wow at The Ritz nightclub in September 1981, Ruza Blue decided to book them at Negril and begin a night called &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot;. That became so popular that it was closed down by the fire department for over-capacity, and Freddy helped Blue (whom he dubbed &quot;Kool Lady Blue&quot;) find another home for the party. Together they chose The Roxy Roller Rink in NYC, which gained national fame once used in the film &quot;Beat Street&quot; (1984).

In 1982 the single &quot;Change the Beat&quot; produced by Bill Laswell’s band Material had an A-side featuring Freddy rapping the song in both English and French, while the B-side was a shorter version of the same song, this time performed entirely in French by female rapper Beside of the band Time Zone, who was credited on the initial pressings of the record as Fab 5 Betty. Freddy utilized a vocoder with a white noise carrier during the chorus and at the end of the B-side track. When the beat stops in Beside&#x27;s version of the song, it is disputed as to whether Freddy or Laswell’s manager says &quot;Ahhhhh, this stuff is really fresh&quot;, a line which is quite possibly the most scratched sample in the history of hip-hop music. It was first utilized as a scratch sample on the 1983 Herbie Hancock single &quot;Rockit&quot;, featuring scratching by legendary DJ and turntablist Grand Mixer DXT, and has been used in over 2000 hip-hop tracks since.

Freddy&#x27;s &quot;Change the Beat&quot; for Celluloid Records would also lead to four other records, including a song about graffiti painting by Futura 2000 with music performed by The Clash, and all were released together first in France and was soon followed by the first hip hop tour in Europe billed as &quot;New York City Rap&quot;, in 1982.

In 1983, Freddy produced a hip-hop version of &quot;Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder&quot; called &quot;Hip Hop Bommi Bop&quot; together with German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen which is said to be the very first co-production of Punk and Hip Hop.

In 1988, Freddy became the first hip hop VJ by hosting the MTV music video show entitled &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;. He later went on to be an associate producer on the 1991 film &quot;New Jack City&quot; in which he also made an appearance. That year he was the subject of an extensive profile by Susan Orlean in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; which began with the sentence &quot;The coolest person in New York at the moment is a man named Fred Brathwaite.&quot; In 1994, he directed the music video &quot;One Love&quot; by rapper Nas. In 2007, he played a murdered rap artist named Terrence &#x27;Fulla T&#x27; Smith on the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; in the episode &quot;Flipped&quot;. The same year, he made a small cameo in the film &quot;American Gangster&quot; directed by Ridley Scott. In 2008, he appears as a special wedding guest in the film &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;, along with other notable musicians, as conceived by producer Jonathan Demme to enhance the expansive and varied soundtrack and wedding members, in contrast with the normal duality of a traditional wedding. In 2016, he played the role of Atticus Howard in &quot;Mob Rules&quot; the fourth episode of the seventh season of the CBS police procedural drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

On August 11, 2017, an animated version of Freddy appeared in a Google Doodle as a narrator, which observed the 44th anniversary of DJ Kool Herc&#x27;s pioneering use of the hip-hop break.

In 2019, coinciding with the release of his Netflix film &quot;Grass Is Greener&quot;, Freddy served as creative director for the full-size hip hop photography and culture exhibit entitled, Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop, based on the 2018 book of the same name created and written by Vikki Tobak (published by Clarkson Potter). The exhibit was hosted by The Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles. Freddy served on several group discussion and lecture panels regarding the show in the months before and during the exhibition.

<text>The progressive squeeze (also termed a &quot;repeating squeeze&quot;) is a contract bridge squeeze that gains two tricks by squeezing one and the same player twice, hence the name. A progressive squeezes is a subset of triple squeezes that, depending both on entries and on positional factors, may result in a subsequent, simple, two-suit squeeze that takes place against the opponent who has just been triple squeezed. Confusing the issue is that some triple squeezes can become progressive squeezes through misdefense.

==Examples==
The first diagram shows a basic example:
 When the ace of clubs is cashed East is squeezed and has to discard one of his red aces, the established king is cashed (this is the progressive squeeze card) and East is squeezed for another trick.

In the above example an extended menace, threatening the immediate loss of two tricks was present. That is not always necessary, a progressive squeeze still works if we have an additional entry as compensation.
 When the ace of clubs is cashed East can either discard the diamond ace, after which the diamond king will seal his fate, or bare one of his major suit holdings in which case the jack in that suit will be the progressive squeeze card. Had West East&#x27;s cards the best defense to discard a spade will break the second squeeze.

<text>Electrology is the practice of electrical hair removal to permanently remove human hair from the body. Electrolysis is the actual process of removing hair using electricity.

In electrolysis, a qualified professional called an electrologist slides a hair-thin, solid metal probe into each hair follicle without puncturing the skin (when inserted properly). Electricity is delivered to the follicle through the probe, which causes localized damage to the areas that generate hairs, either through the formation of caustic sodium hydroxide (the galvanic method), overheating (thermolysis), or both (the blend method).

==Methods==
All three methods (galvanic, thermolysis, and blend) have their own merits, and one method is not better than another. The success depends on the skill of the electrologist, the type of hair being removed, the condition of the skin and the pain threshold of the client. All three methods, when properly performed, can be thorough at destroying the hair matrix cells, and leaving follicles incapable of regrowing hair.

===Galvanic method===
This method is named after Luigi Galvani and uses a person&#x27;s body as an electrolytic cell. Galvanic electrolysis was first reported in medical literature in 1875 by ophthalmologist Charles Michel as a method for removing ingrown eyelashes. A galvanic hair remover is essentially a positive ground power supply that delivers 0–3 milliamperes through the body. The follicular probe is the cathode of an electrolytic cell. Sodium hydroxide formed at the cathode by the process of chemical electrolysis kills the hair matrix cells. Modern galvanic hair removers automatically adjust the voltage to maintain constant current.
===Thermolysis===
Another method is known as thermolysis, also called radio frequency (RF), shortwave or diathermy. 
Thermolysis was developed in the 1920s and first reported in medical literature by Henri Bordier. A thermolytic hair remover is essentially a radio transmitter, usually with an output of about 0–8 watts at a frequency of 13.56 . RF energy emanates from the probe tip to tissue within about a millimeter. Thermolysis works by heating the hair matrix cells to about , causing electrocoagulation.

===Blend method===
The galvanic method and thermolysis are often combined in the blend method, developed by Arthur Hinkel in 1948, which uses both RF and direct current, combining many of the advantages of both methods.

==Technique==
The practitioner selects a metal probe that slides easily into the hair follicle, usually the same diameter as the hair shaft or smaller. The probe is typically 50 to 150 μm (0.002 to 0.006 inches) for all three modalities. Care is needed to insert the probe at the same angle as the hair is growing out of the skin. The probe is inserted to the depth of the hair matrix, the site where hair is formed. The power and duration of the electricity are started at the lowest setting, then gradually increased until the hair comes out as easily as possible. If the patient experiences significant discomfort, the settings can be lowered.

==Status of the profession==
In the United States, electrolysis is regulated in many states, requiring training and licensing.

Electrolysis as a profession faced new competition in the 1990s after laser hair removal was developed and promoted as a quicker and easier way to remove hair. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared laser can only claim to reduce hair growth, not permanently remove it.

<text>Dangerous Visions is an anthology of science fiction short stories edited by American writer Harlan Ellison and illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon. It was published in 1967 and contained 33 stories, none of which had been previously published.

A path-breaking collection, &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; helped define the New Wave science fiction movement, particularly in its depiction of sex in science fiction. Writer/editor Al Sarrantonio wrote that &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; &quot;almost single-handedly [...] changed the way readers thought about science fiction.&quot;

Contributors to the volume included 20 authors who had won, or would win, a Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, or BSFA award, and 16 with multiple such awards. Ellison introduced the anthology both collectively and individually while authors provided afterwords to their own stories.

==Awards and nominations==
The stories and the anthology itself were nominated for and received many awards. &quot;Gonna Roll the Bones&quot; by Fritz Leiber received both a Hugo Award for Best Novelette and a Nebula Award for Best Novelette, whilst Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot; was a nominee for the Hugo in the same category. Philip José Farmer tied for the Hugo Award for Best Novella for &quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot;. Samuel R. Delany won the Nebula for Best Short Story for &quot;Aye, and Gomorrah...&quot; Harlan Ellison received a special citation at the 26th World SF Convention for editing &quot;the most significant and controversial SF book published in 1967.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;You should buy this book immediately&quot;, Algis Budrys wrote, &quot;because this is a book that knows perfectly well that you are seething inside&quot;. He especially praised &quot;Sex and/or Mr. Morrison&quot;.

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #94, and stated that it &quot;poked at all SF&#x27;s taboos, remains a quirky mix of achievement and hype, of stories still brilliantly fresh and stories already moribund two decades ago.&quot;

== Sequels ==
The collection was followed by a larger 1972 sequel, &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot;. The projected third collection, &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot;, was started, but controversially remained unpublished for decades. The final book has become something of a legend as science fiction&#x27;s most famous unpublished book. It was originally announced for publication in 1973, but other work demanded Ellison&#x27;s attention and the anthology did not see print in his lifetime. He came under criticism for his treatment of some writers who submitted their stories to him, whom some estimate to number nearly 150 (and many of whom have died in the ensuing more than four decades since the anthology was first announced). In 1993 Ellison threatened to sue New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) for publishing &quot;Himself in Anachron&quot;, a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and sold to Ellison for the book by his widow, but later reached an amicable settlement. British SF author Christopher Priest critiqued Ellison&#x27;s editorial practices in a widely disseminated article titled &quot;The Book on the Edge of Forever&quot;. Priest documented a half-dozen instances in which Ellison promised &quot;TLDV&quot; would appear within a year of the statement, but did not fulfill those promises. Ellison had a record of fulfilling obligations in other instances, including to writers whose stories he solicited, and expressed outrage at other editors who have displayed poor practices.

On May 2, 2022, J. Michael Straczynski, the executor of the Ellison estate, announced on Twitter that &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot; would be published in 2023 by Blackstone Publishers. On Mar 25, 2024, Straczynski announced on Facebook that &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot; would be available from Amazon on Oct. 1, 2024.

<text>XUL ( ), which stands for XML User Interface Language, is a user interface markup language developed by Mozilla. XUL is an XML dialect for writing graphical user interfaces, enabling developers to write user interface elements in a manner similar to web pages.

XUL applications rely on the Mozilla codebase or a fork of it. The most prominent example is the Firefox web browser. However, Mozilla has significantly reduced the usage of XUL in Firefox after their rewrite of the browser engine in version 57. This resulted in the removal of the legacy add-on system, which relied on XUL and XPCOM, another cross-platform technology Mozilla decided to deprecate shortly before the release of Firefox 57. Firefox originally permitted add-ons to extensively alter its user interface, but this capability was removed in 2017 and replaced with the less-permissive WebExtensions API. Several forks of Firefox retain support for XUL and XPCOM-based add-ons. Waterfox maintains a fork of the legacy Mozilla codebase for the &quot;Waterfox Classic&quot; browser. The Pale Moon browser, Basilisk browser, Hyperbola operating system, and numerous smaller projects collectively use and maintain the Unified XUL Platform (UXP) implementation. 

== History ==

XUL was devised at Netscape in 1997 as part of the development effort that eventually became the Mozilla codebase. XUL is similar to web technologies implemented by the Gecko rendering engine. When XUL was introduced, it added features beyond the then standard HTML 4. It was designed as an extension of HTML to be used with applications rather than documents.

XUL was used by various Mozilla projects, forks of Mozilla projects, and projects closely related to Mozilla. Some software projects such as Songbird, Komodo IDE, and Zotero started as desktop applications that utilized XULRunner to render and compose their UI. In the early 2000s, there was some interest in using XUL by other parties, including Amazon, but those have switched over to HTML5. Many of the features of modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, ECMAScript 5+, WebGL, and WebAssembly that made rich and modern web applications possible, without the need of utilizing legacy NPAPI/PPAPI/ActiveX browser plug-in technologies like Adobe Flash, Silverlight, Java, or Shockwave, also made much of XUL redundant.

Mozilla released Firefox 57, also known as Firefox Quantum, in November 2017. As part of this, Firefox finished transitioning to a multiprocess architecture. Although XUL add-ons could work in this architecture, they often created significant performance issues. Because of this, Mozilla removed support for legacy add-ons, including the use of custom XUL code. Mozilla switched their browser extensions system to the cross-browser WebExtensions API, which is largely based on the Chrome extension API. In late 2017, Firefox still included 289 XUL bindings for native browser components. By the end of 2019, Mozilla had removed all XUL files from their codice_1 repository.

When Mozilla removed support from Firefox, there were still several applications using XUL. Mozilla began gradually removing XUL support from their email client, Thunderbird. They released Thunderbird 78 without support for XUL-based extensions in 2020.
The SeaMonkey internet suite chose to re-implement XUL for the Firefox Quantum codebase, and the suite&#x27;s development has subsequently slowed. The Pale Moon developers forked Mozilla&#x27;s entire Firefox 52 ESR codebase to create the Unified XUL Platform (UXP) for their Goanna rendering engine. UXP maintains the traditional XUL capabilities. As a result, Pale Moon and other UXP applications have remained single-process but more extensible compared to modern versions of Firefox and Thunderbird.

== Usage ==
XUL can only be used with the Mozilla codebase (or a fork of it) because the Gecko (or Goanna) engine does the XUL rendering.

Application programmers need to define a XUL interface as three discrete sets of components:
# Content: the XUL document(s), whose elements define the layout of the user interface
# Skin: the CSS and image files, which define the appearance of an application
# Locale: the files containing user-visible strings for easy software localization

XUL defines a wide range of elements, which roughly belong to the following types:
* Top-level elements: window, page, dialog, wizard, etc.
* Widgets: label, button, text box, list box, combo box, radio button, check box, tree, menu, toolbar, group box, tab box, color-picker, spacer, splitter, etc.
* Box model: box, grid, stack, deck, etc.
* Events and scripts: script, command, key, broadcaster, observer, etc.
* Data source: template, rule, etc.
* Others: overlay, iframe, browser, editor, etc.

The default behavior of XUL widgets can be altered with XBL bindings.

===XBL===

XML Binding Language (XBL) is an XML-based markup language for altering the behavior of a XUL widget, such as a scroll bar. An XBL file contains bindings, each of which describes the behavior of a XUL widget. The root element of an XBL file is the codice_2 element, which contains one or more codice_3 elements. Each codice_3 element declares one binding, which can be attached to any XUL element. It may also possess an codice_5 attribute. A binding is assigned to an element by setting the CSS property codice_6 to the URL of the binding&#x27;s file. For example:

scrollbar {
 -moz-binding: url(&#x27;somefile.xml#binding1&#x27;);


=== Example ===

This example shows three buttons stacked on top of each other in a vertical box container:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;

&lt;window id=&quot;vbox example&quot; title=&quot;Example 3...&quot;
xmlns=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;
 &lt;layout&gt;
 &lt;button id=&quot;yes1&quot; label=&quot;Yes&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;button id=&quot;no1&quot; label=&quot;No&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;button id=&quot;maybe1&quot; label=&quot;Maybe&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/layout&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;
==&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; reference ==
XUL contains a reference to the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The film&#x27;s antagonist is the fictional deity Zuul, the Gatekeeper. Zuul possesses the character Dana Barrett and declares: &quot;There is no Dana. There is only Zuul.&quot; The creators of XUL, pronounced the same as Zuul, made the slogan, &quot;There is no data. There is only XUL!&quot;. The slogan and Zuul as a gatekeeper are referenced in XUL&#x27;s XML namespace URI and were previously present in all Firefox add-ons:

<text>Ferdinand Gregorovius (; 19 January 1821 – 1 May 1891) was a German historian who specialized in the medieval history of Rome.

==Biography==
Gregorovius was the son of Neidenburg district justice council Ferdinand Timotheus Gregorovius and his wife Wilhelmine Charlotte Dorothea Kausch. An earlier ancestor named Grzegorzewski had come to Prussia from Poland. Members of the Gregorovius family lived in Prussia for over 300 years, and produced many jurists, preachers and artists. One famous ancestor of Ferdinand&#x27;s was Johann Adam Gregorovius, born 1681 in Johannisburg, district of Gumbinnen.

Ferdinand Gregorovius was born at Neidenburg, East Prussia (now Nidzica, Poland), and studied theology and philosophy at the University of Königsberg. In 1838, he joined the student association, the Corps Masovia. After teaching for many years, Gregorovius took up residence in Italy in 1852, where he remained for over twenty years. In 1876, he was made an honorary citizen of Rome, the first German to be awarded this honor. A street and a square are named after him. He eventually returned to Germany, where he died in Munich.

He is best known for &quot;Wanderjahre in Italien&quot;, his account of the travels on foot that he took through Italy in the 1850s, and the monumental &quot;Die Geschichte der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter&quot; (&quot;History of Rome in the Middle Ages&quot;), a classic for Medieval and early Renaissance history. He also wrote biographies of Pope Alexander VI and Lucrezia Borgia, as well as works on Byzantine history and medieval Athens, and translated Italian authors into German, among them Giovanni Melis. According to Father John Hardon , Gregorovius was &quot;a bitter enemy of the popes.&quot;

<doc id="142383" wikidata="Q6165023" url="?curid=142383" title="Java Speech Markup Language">
<text>Java Speech API Markup Language (JSML) is an XML-based markup language for annotating text input to speech synthesizers. JSML is used within the Java Speech API. JSML is an XML application and conforms to the requirements of well-formed XML documents. Java Speech API Markup Language is referred to as JSpeech Markup Language when describing the W3C documentation of the standard. Java Speech API Markup Language and JSpeech Markup Language identical apart from the change in name, which is made to protect Sun trademarks.

JSML was developed by Andrew Hunt at Sun Microsystems.

== Usage ==
JSML is primarily an XML text format used by Java applications to annotate text input to speech synthesizers. Elements of JSML provide speech synthesizer with detailed information on how to speak text in a naturalized fashion.

JSML defines elements which define a document&#x27;s structure, the pronunciation of certain words and phrases, features of speech such as emphasis and intonation, etc. JSML is designed in the Java fashion to be simple to learn and use, to be portable across different synthesizers and computing platforms, and although designed for use within is also applicable to a wide range of languages. 

== Example ==
An example of how JSML is defined is set out below:
&lt;jsml&gt; 
 &lt;div type=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;This block about &lt;literal&gt;JSML&lt;/literal&gt; is constructed as
 a &lt;emphasis&gt;&lt;literal&gt; JSML &lt;/literal&gt;&lt;/emphasis&gt; example.&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/jsml&gt;
== Related standards ==
JSML built on the original proposal for a speech synthesis markup language (SSML), a set of general markup tags that could be used across different text-to-speech (TTS) systems.

The W3C developed a standard markup language called VoiceXML, also often referred to as SSML, which is based on JSML but is not identical to it. This became a formal W3C recommendation in 2004.

<text>Ned Ludd () is the legendary person to whom the Luddites attributed the name of their movement.

In 1779, Ludd is supposed to have broken two stocking frames in a fit of rage. When the &quot;Luddites&quot; emerged in the 1810s, his identity was appropriated to become the folkloric character of Captain Ludd, also known as King Lud or General Ludd, the Luddites&#x27; alleged leader and founder.

==Origin of the name Ludd==
It has been claimed that the name &quot;Ned Ludd&quot; came from an &quot;Edward Ludlam&quot; who was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Anstey.

==History==
Supposedly, Ludd was a weaver from Anstey, near Leicester, England. In 1779, after either being whipped for idleness or taunted by local youths, he smashed two knitting frames in what was described as a &quot;fit of passion&quot;. This story can be traced to an article in &quot;The Nottingham Review&quot; on 20 December 1811, but there is no independent evidence of its veracity. John Blackner&#x27;s book &quot;History of Nottingham&quot;, also published in 1811, provides a variant tale, of a lad called &quot;Ludlam&quot; who was told by his father, a framework-knitter, to &quot;square his needles&quot;. Ludlam took a hammer and &quot;beat them into a heap&quot;. News of the incident spread, and whenever frames were sabotaged, people would jokingly say &quot;Ned Ludd did it&quot;.

By 1812, organised frame-breakers became known as Luddites, using the name King Ludd or Captain Ludd for their mythical leader. Letters and proclamations were signed by &quot;Ned Ludd&quot;.

<doc id="142388" wikidata="Q223805" url="?curid=142388" title="Ahriman">
<text>Angra Mainyu (; ) is the Avestan name of Zoroastrianism&#x27;s hypostasis of the &quot;destructive/evil spirit&quot; and the main adversary in Zoroastrianism either of the Spenta Mainyu, the &quot;holy/creative spirits/mentality&quot;, or directly of Ahura Mazda, the highest deity of Zoroastrianism. The Middle Persian equivalent is Ahriman (anglicised pronunciation: ). The name can appear in English-language works as Ahrimanes. 

==In the Avesta==
===In Zoroaster&#x27;s revelation===
Avestan &quot;angra mainyu&quot; &quot;seems to have been an original conception of Zoroaster&#x27;s.&quot; In the Gathas, which are the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and are attributed to Zoroaster, &quot;angra mainyu&quot; is not yet a proper name. In the one instance in these hymns where the two words appear together, the concept spoken of is that of a &quot;mainyu&quot; (&quot;mind&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot; or otherwise an abstract energy etc.) that is &quot;angra&quot; (&quot;destructive&quot;, &quot;chaotic&quot;, &quot;disorderly&quot;, &quot;inhibitive&quot;, &quot;malign&quot; etc., of which a manifestation can be anger). In this single instance – in &quot;Yasna&quot; 45.2 – the &quot;more bounteous of the spirits twain&quot; declares &quot;angra mainyu&quot; to be its &quot;absolute antithesis&quot;.

A similar statement occurs in &quot;Yasna&quot; 30.3, where the antithesis is however &quot;aka mainyu&quot;, &quot;aka&quot; being the Avestan language word for &quot;evil&quot;. Hence, &quot;aka mainyu&quot; is the &quot;evil spirit&quot; or &quot;evil mind&quot; or &quot;evil thought,&quot; as contrasted with &quot;spenta mainyu&quot;, the &quot;bounteous spirit&quot; with which Ahura Mazda conceived of creation, which then &quot;was&quot;.

The &quot;aka mainyu&quot; epithet recurs in &quot;Yasna&quot; 32.5, when the principle is identified with the &quot;daeva&quot;s that deceive humankind and themselves. While in later Zoroastrianism, the &quot;daevas&quot; are demons, this is not yet evident in the Gathas: Zoroaster stated that the &quot;daevas&quot; are &quot;wrong gods&quot; or &quot;false gods&quot; that are to be rejected, but they are not yet demons. Some have also proposed a connection between &quot;Angra Mainyu&quot; and the sage Angiras of the Rigveda. If this is true, it could be understood as evidence for a religious schism between the deva-worshiping Vedic Indo-Aryans and early Zoroastrians.

In &quot;Yasna&quot; 32.3, these &quot;daevas&quot; are identified as the offspring, not of Angra Mainyu, but of &quot;akem manah&quot;, &quot;evil thinking&quot;. A few verses earlier it is however the &quot;daebaaman&quot;, &quot;deceiver&quot; – not otherwise identified but &quot;probably Angra Mainyu&quot; – who induces the &quot;daevas&quot; to choose &quot;achistem manah&quot; – &quot;worst thinking.&quot; In &quot;Yasna&quot; 32.13, the abode of the wicked is not the abode of Angra Mainyu, but the abode of the same &quot;worst thinking&quot;. &quot;One would have expected [Angra Mainyu] to reign in hell, since he had created &#x27;death and how, at the end, the worst existence shall be for the deceitful&#x27; (&quot;Y.&quot; 30.4).&quot;

===In the Younger Avesta===
&quot;Yasna&quot; 19.15 recalls that Ahura Mazda&#x27;s recital of the Ahuna Vairya invocation puts Angra Mainyu in a stupor. In &quot;Yasna&quot; 9.8, Angra Mainyu creates Aži Dahaka, but the serpent recoils at the sight of Mithra&#x27;s mace (&quot;Yasht&quot; 10.97, 10.134). In &quot;Yasht&quot; 13, the Fravashis defuse Angra Mainyu&#x27;s plans to dry up the earth, and in &quot;Yasht&quot; 8.44 Angra Mainyu battles but cannot defeat Tishtrya and so prevent the rains. In &quot;Vendidad&quot; 19, Angra Mainyu urges Zoroaster to turn from the good religion by promising him sovereignty of the world. On being rejected, Angra Mainyu assails Zoroaster with legions of demons, but Zoroaster deflects them all. In &quot;Yasht&quot; 19.96, a verse that reflects a Gathic injunction, Angra Mainyu will be vanquished and Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail.

In &quot;Yasht&quot; 19.46ff, Angra Mainyu and Spenta Mainyu battle for possession of &quot;khvaraenah&quot;, &quot;divine glory&quot; or &quot;fortune&quot;. In some verses of the Yasna (e.g. &quot;Yasna&quot; 57.17), the two principles are said to have created the world, which seems to contradict the Gathic principle that declares Ahura Mazda to be the sole creator and which is reiterated in the cosmogony of &quot;Vendidad&quot; 1. In that first chapter, which is the basis for the 9th–12th-century &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, the creation of sixteen lands by Ahura Mazda is countered by the Angra Mainyu&#x27;s creation of sixteen scourges such as winter, sickness, and vice. &quot;This shift in the position of Ahura Mazda, his total assimilation to this Bounteous Spirit [Mazda&#x27;s instrument of creation], must have taken place in the 4th century BC at the latest; for it is reflected in Aristotle&#x27;s testimony, which confronts Areimanios with Oromazdes (apud Diogenes Laertius, 1.2.6).&quot;

&quot;Yasht&quot; 15.43 assigns Angra Mainyu to the nether world, a world of darkness. So also &quot;Vendidad &quot; 19.47, but other passages in the same chapter (19.1 and 19.44) have him dwelling in the region of the &quot;daeva&quot;s, which the &quot;Vendidad&quot; asserts is in the north. There (19.1, 19.43–44), Angra Mainyu is the &quot;daevanam daevo&quot;, &quot;&quot;daeva&quot; of &quot;daeva&quot;s&quot; or chief of the &quot;daeva&quot;s. The superlative &quot;daevo.taema&quot; is however assigned to the demon Paitisha (&quot;opponent&quot;). In an enumeration of the &quot;daeva&quot;s in Vendidad 1.43, Angra Mainyu appears first and Paitisha appears last. &quot;Nowhere is Angra Mainyu said to be the creator of the &quot;daeva&quot;s or their father.&quot;

==In Zurvanite Zoroastrianism==

Zurvanism – a historical branch of Zoroastrianism that sought to theologically resolve a dilemma found in a mention of antithetical &quot;twin spirits&quot; in &quot;Yasna&quot; 30.3 – developed a notion that Ahura Mazda (MP: Ohrmuzd) and Angra Mainyu (MP: Ahriman) were twin brothers, with the former being the epitome of good and the latter being the epitome of evil. This mythology of twin brotherhood is only explicitly attested in the post-Sassanid Syriac and Armenian polemic such as that of Eznik of Kolb. According to these sources the genesis saw Zurvan as an androgynous deity, existing alone but desiring offspring who would create &quot;heaven and hell and everything in between.&quot; Zurvan then sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards the end of this period, Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and in the moment of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for the doubt. Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan&#x27;s decision, which he then communicated to his brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000 years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity. Eznik of Kolb also summarizes a myth in which Ahriman is said to have demonstrated an ability to create life by creating the peacock.

The story of Ahriman&#x27;s ripping open the womb to emerge first suggests that Zurvanite ideology perceived Ahriman to be evil by choice, rather than always having been intrinsically evil (as found, for example, in the cosmological myths of the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;). And the story of Ahriman&#x27;s creation of the peacock suggests that Zurvanite ideology perceived Ahriman to be a creator figure like Ormazd. This is significantly different from what is found in the Avesta (where Mazda&#x27;s stock epithet is &quot;dadvah&quot;, &quot;Creator&quot;, implying Mazda is &quot;the&quot; Creator), as well as in Zoroastrian tradition where creation of life continues to be exclusively Mazda&#x27;s domain, and where creation is said to have been good until it was corrupted by Ahriman and the &quot;dev&quot;s.

==In Zoroastrian tradition==
In the Pahlavi texts of the 9th–12th century, Ahriman (written &quot;ʼhl(y)mn&quot;) is frequently written upside down &quot;as a sign of contempt and disgust.&quot;

In the &quot;Book of Arda Viraf&quot; 5.10, the narrator – the &#x27;righteous Viraf&#x27; – is taken by Sarosh and Adar to see &quot;the reality of God and the archangels, and the non-reality of Ahriman and the demons&quot; as described by the German philologist and orientalist Martin Haug, whose radical interpretation was to change the faith in the 19th century (see &quot;In present-day Zoroastrianism&quot; below).
 This idea of &quot;non-reality&quot; is also expressed in other texts, such as the &quot;Denkard&quot;, a 9th-century &quot;encyclopedia of Mazdaism&quot;, which states Ahriman &quot;has never been and never will be.&quot; In chapter 100 of &quot;Book of the Arda Viraf&quot;, which is titled &#x27;Ahriman&#x27;, the narrator sees the &quot;Evil spirit, ... whose religion is evil [and] who ever ridiculed and mocked the wicked in hell.&quot;

In the Zurvanite &quot;Ulema-i Islam&quot; (a Zoroastrian text, despite the title), &quot;Ahriman also is called by some name by some people and they ascribe evil unto him but nothing can also be done by him without Time.&quot; A few chapters later, the Ulema notes that &quot;it is clear that Ahriman is a non-entity&quot; but &quot;at the resurrection Ahriman will be destroyed and thereafter all will be good; and [change?] will proceed through the will of God.&quot; In the &quot;Sad Dar&quot;, the world is described as having been created by Ohrmuzd and become pure through his truth. But Ahriman, &quot;being devoid of anything good, does not issue from that which is owing to truth.&quot; (62.2)

&quot;Book of Jamaspi&quot; 2.3 notes that &quot;Ahriman, like a worm, is so much associated with darkness and old age, that he perishes in the end.&quot; Chapter 4.3 recalls the grotesque legend of Tahmurasp (Avestan: Taxma Urupi) riding Angra Mainyu for thirty years (cf. &quot;Yasht&quot; 15.12, 19.29) and so preventing him from doing evil. In chapter 7, Jamasp explains that the Indians declare Ahriman will die, but &quot;those, who are not of good religion, go to hell.&quot;

The &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, a Zoroastrian account of creation completed in the 12th century has much to say about Ahriman and his role in the cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the Ahuna Vairya, Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman&#x27;s incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates Jeh, the primal seductress who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the &quot;yazad&quot;s on one side and Ahriman with his &quot;dev&quot;s on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation. But the battle goes on, with mankind caught in the middle, whose duty it remains to withstand the forces of evil through good thoughts, words and deeds.

Other texts see the world created by Ohrmuzd as a trap for Ahriman, who is then distracted by creation and expends his force in a battle he cannot win. (&quot;The epistles of Zatspram&quot; 3.23; &quot;Shkand Gumanig Vichar&quot; 4.63–4.79). The &quot;Dadistan denig&quot; explains that Ohrmuzd, being omniscient, knew of Ahriman&#x27;s intent, but it would have been against his &quot;justice and goodness to punish Ahriman before he wrought evil [and] this is why the world is created.&quot;

Ahriman has no such omniscience, a fact that Ohrmuzd reminds him of (&quot;Bundahishn&quot; 1.16). In contrast, in Manichaean scripture, Mani ascribes foresight to Ahriman.

Some Zoroastrians believed Ahriman &quot;created dangerous storms, plagues, and monsters during the struggle with Ahura Mazda&quot; and that the two gods were twins.

==In present-day Zoroastrianism==
In 1862, Martin Haug proposed a new reconstruction of what he believed was Zoroaster&#x27;s original monotheistic teaching, as expressed in the Gathas – a teaching which he believed had been corrupted by later Zoroastrian dualistic tradition as expressed in post-Gathic scripture and in the texts of tradition.
For Angra Mainyu, this interpretation meant a demotion from a spirit coequal with Ahura Mazda to a mere product of Ahura Mazda. Haug&#x27;s theory was based to a great extent on a new interpretation of &quot;Yasna&quot; 30.3; he argued that the good &quot;twin&quot; in that passage should not be regarded as more or less identical to Ahura Mazda, as earlier Zoroastrian thought had assumed, but as a separate created entity, Spenta Mainyu. Thus, both Angra Mainyu and Spenta Mainyu were created by Ahura Mazda, and should be regarded as his respective &#x27;creative&#x27; and &#x27;destructive&#x27; emanations.

Haug&#x27;s interpretation was gratefully received by the Parsis of Bombay, who at the time were under considerable pressure from Christian missionaries (most notable amongst them John Wilson)
who sought converts among the Zoroastrian community and criticized Zoroastrianism for its alleged dualism as contrasted with their own monotheism.
Haug&#x27;s reconstruction had also other attractive aspects that seemed to make the religion more compatible with nineteenth-century enlightenment, as he attributed to Zoroaster a rejection of rituals and of worship of entities other than the supreme deity.

These new ideas were subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, which eventually reached the west and so in turn corroborated Haug&#x27;s theories. Among the Parsis of the cities, who were accustomed to English language literature, Haug&#x27;s ideas were more often repeated than those of the Gujarati language objections of the priests, with the result that Haug&#x27;s ideas became well entrenched and are today almost universally accepted as doctrine.

While some modern scholars
have theories similar to Haug&#x27;s regarding Angra Mainyu&#x27;s origins,
many now think that the traditional &quot;dualist&quot; interpretation was in fact correct all along and that Angra Mainyu was always considered to be completely separate and independent from Ahura Mazda.

== The Worship of Ahriman ==
According to Plutarch, Zoroaster taught the worship of Ahriman. The Encyclopedia of Iran claims:
== Islam ==
In Islamic discourse, Ahriman embodies the absolute evil (the Devil) in contrast to Iblis (Satan) who represents an original noble being still under God&#x27;s power. Although the &quot;divs&quot;, the creations of Ahriman in Zorastian beliefs, entered Islamic literature, to the point of being identified with the demons of Islamic religion, Ahriman is mostly a stylistic device to refute the idea of absolute evil. 

Rumi denies the existence of Ahriman completely: This is our main quarrel with the Magians (Zoroastrians). They say there are two Gods: the creator of good and the creator of evil. Show me good without evil – then I will admit there is a God of evil and a God of good. This is impossible, for good cannot exist without evil. Since there is no separation between them, how can there be two creators?

== Anthroposophy==
Rudolf Steiner, who founded the esoteric spiritual movement Anthroposophy, used the concept of Ahriman to name one of two extreme forces which pull humanity away from the centering influence of God. Steiner associated Ahriman, the lower spirit, with materialism, science, heredity, objectivity, and soul-hardening. He thought that contemporary Christianity was subject to Ahrimanic influence, since it tended towards materialistic interpretations. Steiner predicted that Ahriman, as a supersensible Being, would incarnate into an earthly form, some little time after our present earthly existence, in fact in the third post-Christian millennium.

== &quot;Opus Sanctorum Angelorum&quot; ==
The &quot;Opus Sanctorum Angelorum&quot;, a debated group inside the Roman Catholic Church, defines Ahriman as a &quot;demon in the Rank of Fallen Powers&quot;. It says his duty is to obscure human brains from the Truth of God.

<text>Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion (also antiproton-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion) is a variation of nuclear pulse propulsion based upon the injection of antimatter into a mass of nuclear fuel to initiate a nuclear chain reaction for propulsion when the fuel does not normally have a critical mass.

Technically, the process is not a &#x27;&quot;catalyzed&#x27;&quot; reaction because anti-protons (antimatter) used to start the reaction are consumed; if they were present as a catalyst the particles would be unchanged by the process and used to initiate further reactions. Although antimatter particles may be produced by the reaction itself, they are not used to initiate or sustain chain reactions.

== Description ==
Typical nuclear pulse propulsion has the downside that the minimal size of the engine is defined by the minimal size of the nuclear bombs used to create thrust, which is a function of the amount of critical mass required to initiate the reaction. A conventional thermonuclear bomb design consists of two parts: the &quot;primary&quot;, which is almost always based on plutonium, and a &quot;secondary&quot; using fusion fuel, which is normally deuterium in the form of lithium deuteride, and tritium (which is created during the reaction as lithium is transmuted to tritium). There is a minimal size for the primary (about 10 kilograms for plutonium-239) to achieve critical mass. More powerful devices scale up in size primarily through the addition of fusion fuel for the secondary. Of the two, the fusion fuel is much less expensive and gives off far fewer radioactive products, so from a cost and efficiency standpoint, larger bombs are much more efficient. However, using such large bombs for spacecraft propulsion demands much larger structures able to handle the stress. There is a tradeoff between the two demands.

By injecting a small amount of antimatter into a subcritical mass of fuel (typically plutonium or uranium) fission of the fuel can be forced. An anti-proton has a negative electric charge, just like an electron, and can be captured in a similar way by a positively charged atomic nucleus. The initial configuration, however, is not stable and radiates energy as gamma rays. As a consequence, the anti-proton moves closer and closer to the nucleus until their quarks can interact, at which point the anti-proton and a proton are both annihilated. This reaction releases a tremendous amount of energy, of which some is released as gamma rays and some is transferred as kinetic energy to the nucleus, causing it to split (the fission reaction). The resulting shower of neutrons can cause the surrounding fuel to undergo rapid fission or even nuclear fusion.

The lower limit of the device size is determined by anti-proton handling issues and fission reaction requirements, such as the structure used to contain and direct the blast. As such, unlike either the Project Orion-type propulsion system, which requires large numbers of nuclear explosive charges, or the various antimatter drives, which require impossibly expensive amounts of antimatter, antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion has intrinsic advantages. 

A conceptual design of an antimatter-catalyzed thermonuclear explosive physics package is one in which the primary mass of plutonium usually necessary for the ignition in a conventional Teller–Ulam thermonuclear explosion, is replaced by one microgram of antihydrogen. In this theoretical design, the antimatter is helium-cooled and magnetically levitated in the center of the device, in the form of a pellet a tenth of a millimeter in diameter, a position analogous to the primary fission core in the layer cake/Sloika design. As the antimatter must remain away from ordinary matter until the desired moment of the explosion, the central pellet must be isolated from the surrounding hollow sphere of 100 grams of thermonuclear fuel. During and after the implosive compression by the high-explosive lenses, the fusion fuel comes into contact with the antihydrogen. Annihilation reactions, which would start soon after the Penning trap is destroyed, is to provide the energy to begin the nuclear fusion in the thermonuclear fuel. If the chosen degree of compression is high, a device with increased explosive/propulsive effects is obtained, and if it is low, that is, the fuel is not at high density, a considerable number of neutrons will escape the device, and a neutron bomb forms. In both cases the electromagnetic pulse effect and the radioactive fallout are substantially lower than that of a conventional fission or Teller–Ulam device of the same yield, approximately 1 kt.

== Amount needed for thermonuclear device ==
The number of antiprotons required for triggering one thermonuclear explosion were calculated in 2005 to be 1018, which means microgram amounts of antihydrogen.

Tuning of the performance of a space vehicle is also possible. Rocket efficiency is strongly related to the mass of the working mass used, which in this case is the nuclear fuel. The energy released by a given mass of fusion fuel is several times larger than that released by the same mass of a fission fuel. For missions requiring short periods of high thrust, such as crewed interplanetary missions, pure microfission might be preferred because it reduces the number of fuel elements needed. For missions with longer periods of higher efficiency but with lower thrust, such as outer-planet probes, a combination of microfission and fusion might be preferred because it would reduce the total fuel mass.

== Research ==
The concept was invented at Pennsylvania State University before 1992. Since then, several groups have studied antimatter-catalyzed micro fission/fusion engines in the lab. Work has been performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on antiproton-initiated fusion as early as 2004. In contrast to the large mass, complexity and recirculating power of conventional drivers for inertial confinement fusion (ICF), antiproton annihilation offers a specific energy of 90 MJ/μg and thus a unique form of energy packaging and delivery. In principle, antiproton drivers could provide a profound reduction in system mass for advanced space propulsion by ICF.

Antiproton-driven ICF is a speculative concept, and the handling of antiprotons and their required injection precision—temporally and spatially—will present significant technical challenges. The storage and manipulation of low-energy antiprotons, particularly in the form of antihydrogen, is a science in its infancy, and a large scale-up of antiproton production over present supply methods would be required to embark on a serious R&amp;D programme for such applications.

A record for antimatter storage of just over 1000 seconds, performed in the CERN facility, during 2011, was at the time a monumental leap from the millisecond timescales that previously were achievable.

Total world-wide production of anti-protons in a period of a year is in the range of nanograms. The anti-matter trap (Mark 1 version) at Penn State University has the capacity for the storage of 10 billion for a period of approximately 168 hours. Project Icarus has given the estimated potential cost of production of 1 milligram of anti-proton as $100 billion.

<doc id="142391" wikidata="Q372109" url="?curid=142391" title="Nicephorus Gregoras">
<text>Nicephorus Gregoras (; Greek: , &quot;Nikēphoros Grēgoras&quot;; c. 1295 – 1360) was a Byzantine Greek astronomer, historian, and theologian. His 37-volume &quot;Roman History&quot;, a work of erudition, constitutes a primary documentary source for the 14th century.

== Life ==
Gregoras was born at Heraclea Pontica, where he was raised and educated by his uncle, John, who was the Bishop of Heraclea. At an early age he settled at Constantinople, where his uncle introduced him to Andronicus II Palaeologus, by whom he was appointed &quot;chartophylax&quot; (keeper of the archives). In 1326 Gregoras proposed (in a treatise which remains in existence) certain reforms in the calendar, which the emperor refused to carry out for fear of disturbances; over two hundred years later they were introduced by Gregory XIII on almost the same lines.

=== Downfall of Andronicus II ===
When Andronicus was dethroned (1328) by his grandson Andronicus III Palaeologus, Gregoras shared his downfall and retired into private life. Attacked by Barlaam of Calabria, he was with difficulty persuaded to come forward and meet him in a war of words, in which Barlaam was bested. This greatly enhanced his reputation and brought him a large number of pupils.

Gregoras remained loyal until the death of the elder Andronicus. Thereafter he succeeded in gaining the favour of Andronicus III, who appointed him to conduct negotiations for a union of the Greek and Latin churches with the ambassadors of Pope John XXII. The negotiations, which took place in 1333, failed to achieve a resolution.

=== Hesychast controversy ===
Beginning in 1346, Gregoras took an important part in the Hesychast controversy at the encouragement of the Empress Anna, by publishing a tract in which he staunchly opposed Gregorius Palamas, the chief supporter of the doctrine. Although he persuaded some prominent churchmen, such as Joseph of Ganos and Arsenios of Tyre, his opinion was opposed to those of Emperor John VI Cantacuzene. Although he presented his views at length at the synod of 1351, that synod declared his views heretical and the doctrines of Palamas orthodox. He and other dissidents were given the opportunity to recant, and he refused. He was then practically imprisoned in a monastery for two years.

=== Campaign against doctrine of Gregorius Palamas ===
Although the doctrine of Gregorius Palamas came to be accepted by the majority of the Orthodox Church, Gregoras persisted in campaigning against what he considered a heretical doctrine forced upon the Church by a robber council. He became a monk and devoted himself to campaigning against the Palamites, destroying his friendship with John Cantacuzene. He was first placed under house arrest, then confined to the Chora Monastery. When he was released from the monastery in 1354, Gregoras returned to his preaching and denunciations. Gregoras devotes two of the 37 books of his &quot;Roman History&quot; on his objections to the doctrine of Palamas; according to Donald Nicol, &quot;It is disappointing that Gregoras the philosopher and historian should have degenerated into a ranting polemicist in his declining years.&quot;

== Writings ==

Gregoras&#x27; chief work is his &quot;Roman History&quot;, in 37 books, covering the years 1204 to 1359. It partly supplements and partly continues the work of George Pachymeres. Gregoras shows considerable industry, but his style is pompous and affected. This work and that of John Cantacuzene supplement and correct each other, and should be read together.

The other writings of Gregoras, which (with a few exceptions) still remain unpublished, attest his great versatility. Amongst them may be mentioned a history of the dispute with Palamas; biographies of his uncle and early instructor John, metropolitan of Heraclea, and of the martyr Codratus of Antioch; funeral orations for Theodore Metochites, and the two emperors Andronicus; commentaries on the wanderings of Odysseus and on Synesius&#x27;s treatise on dreams; tracts on orthography and on words of doubtful meaning; a philosophical dialogue called &quot;Phlorentius&quot; or &quot;Concerning Wisdom&quot;; astronomical treatises on the date of Easter, on the preparation of the astrolabe and on the predictive calculation of solar eclipses; and an extensive correspondence.

<doc id="142395" wikidata="Q349077" url="?curid=142395" title="Rupert Sheldrake">
<text>Alfred Rupert Sheldrake (born 28 June 1942) is an English author and parapsychology researcher. He proposed the concept of morphic resonance, a conjecture that lacks mainstream acceptance and has been widely criticized as pseudoscience. He has worked as a biochemist at Cambridge University, a Harvard scholar, a researcher at the Royal Society, and a plant physiologist for ICRISAT in India.

Other work by Sheldrake encompasses paranormal subjects such as precognition, empirical research into telepathy, and the psychic staring effect. He has been described as a New Age author.

Sheldrake&#x27;s morphic resonance posits that &quot;memory is inherent in nature&quot; and that &quot;natural systems ... inherit a collective memory from all previous things of their kind.&quot; Sheldrake proposes that it is also responsible for &quot;telepathy-type interconnections between organisms.&quot; His advocacy of the idea offers idiosyncratic explanations of standard subjects in biology such as development, inheritance, and memory.

Critics cite a lack of evidence for morphic resonance and inconsistencies between its tenets and data from genetics, embryology, neuroscience, and biochemistry. They also express concern that popular attention paid to Sheldrake&#x27;s books and public appearances undermines the public&#x27;s understanding of science.

==Early life and education==
Sheldrake was born on 28 June 1942, in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, to Reginald Sheldrake and Doris (née Tebbutt). His father was a University of Nottingham-educated pharmacist who ran a chemist&#x27;s shop on the same road as his parents&#x27; wallpaper shop. Sheldrake credits his father (an amateur naturalist and microscopist) with supporting his interests in zoology and botany.

Although his parents were Methodists, they sent him to Worksop College, an Anglican boarding school. Sheldrake has said:

I went through the standard scientific atheist phase when I was about 14 ... I bought into that package deal of science equals atheism. I was the only boy at my high Anglican boarding school who refused to get confirmed.

In the nine-month period before starting college, Sheldrake worked at the Parke-Davis pharmacology research lab in London, an experience he described as formative due to the required destruction of lab animals, which he found deeply unsettling. At Clare College, Cambridge, Sheldrake studied biology and biochemistry. In 1964, he was awarded a fellowship to study the philosophy and history of science at Harvard University. After a year at Harvard, he returned to Cambridge, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1968 for his work in plant development and plant hormones.

== Career ==
After obtaining his PhD, Sheldrake became a fellow of Clare College, working in biochemistry and cell biology with funding from the Royal Society Rosenheim Research Fellowship. He investigated auxins, a class of plant hormone that plays a role in plant vascular cell differentiation. Sheldrake and Philip Rubery developed the chemiosmotic model of polar auxin transport.

Sheldrake has said that he ended this line of research when he concluded:

From 1968 to 1969, Sheldrake worked at the University of Malaya.

Having an interest in Indian philosophy, Hinduism and transcendental meditation, Sheldrake resigned his position at Clare and went to work on the physiology of tropical crops in Hyderabad, India, as principal plant physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) from 1974 to 1978. There he published on crop physiology and co-authored a book on the anatomy of the pigeonpea.

Sheldrake left ICRISAT to focus on writing &quot;A New Science of Life&quot;, during which time he spent a year and a half in the Saccidananda Ashram of Bede Griffiths, a Benedictine monk active in interfaith dialogue with Hinduism. Published in 1981, the book outlines his concept of morphic resonance, of which he has said:

After writing &quot;A New Science of Life&quot;, he continued at ICRISAT as a part-time consultant physiologist until 1985.

Sheldrake published his second book, &quot;The Presence of the Past,&quot; in 1988. In the 1990s and 2000s, he continued to publish books, which included several joint discussions with Ralph Abraham, a mathematician, and Terence McKenna, an ethnobotanist and mystic. Sheldrake also collaborated with Matthew Fox, a priest and theologian, on two books in 1996.

Sheldrake was one of six subjects, along with Oliver Sacks, Daniel Dennett, Stephen Jay Gould, Freeman Dyson, Stephen Toulmin, who were covered in 1993 by the Dutch filmmaker Wim Kayzer in &quot;A Glorious Accident,&quot; a documentary series that posed a series of questions about consciousness and culminated in a roundtable discussion between the participants. The film was shown on Dutch public broadcasting system VPRO in 1993, followed by United States PBS member station WNET in 1994. The book &quot;A Glorious Accident: Understanding Our Place in the Cosmic Puzzle&quot; was produced from the transcripts of the program and published in both Dutch and English.

Since 2004, Sheldrake has been a visiting professor at the Graduate Institute in Bethany, Connecticut, where he was also academic director of the Holistic Learning and Thinking Program until 2012. From September 2005 until 2010, Sheldrake was director of the Perrott–Warrick Project for psychical research for research on unexplained human and animal abilities, funded from Trinity College, Cambridge. As of 2014, he was a fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences in California and a fellow of Schumacher College in Devon, England. Since 2014, he has been a fellow of the Temenos Academy, London.

In 2017, Sheldrake published a dialog with science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer titled &quot;Arguing Science: A Dialogue on the Future of Science and Spirit&quot;. In 2023, at the How The Light Gets In festival of philosophy in Hay-on-Wye, UK, Sheldrake debated Shermer. In 2023, Sheldrake debated the existence of consciousness outside of brains at the University Aula in Bergen, Norway, alongside anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann and neuroscientist Anil Seth.

Sheldrake has outlined his spiritual practices in two books: &quot;Science and Spiritual Practices&quot; (2017) and &quot;Ways to Go Beyond and Why They Work&quot; (2019).

==Selected books==
Reviews of Sheldrake&#x27;s books have at times been extremely negative about their scientific content, but some have been positive. In 2009, Adam Rutherford, geneticist and deputy editor of &quot;Nature&quot;, criticised Sheldrake&#x27;s books for containing research that was not subjected to the peer-review process expected for science, and suggested that his books were best &quot;ignored.&quot;

=== &quot;A New Science of Life&quot; (1981) ===
Sheldrake&#x27;s &quot;A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance&quot; (1981) proposes that through morphic resonance, various perceived phenomena, particularly biological ones, become more probable the more often they occur, and that biological growth and behaviour thus become guided into patterns laid down by previous similar events. As a result, he suggests, newly acquired behaviours can be passed down to future generations—a biological proposition akin to the Lamarckian inheritance theory. He generalises this approach to assert that it explains many aspects of science, from evolution to the laws of nature, which, in Sheldrake&#x27;s formulation, are merely mutable habits that have been evolving and changing since the Big Bang.

John Davy wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; that the implications of &quot;A New Science of Life&quot; were &quot;fascinating and far-reaching, and would turn upside down a lot of orthodox science,&quot; and that they would &quot;merit attention if some of its predictions are supported by experiment.&quot;

In subsequent books, Sheldrake continued to promote morphic resonance.

The morphic resonance hypothesis is rejected by numerous critics on many grounds, and has been labelled pseudoscience and magical thinking. These grounds include the lack of evidence for it and its inconsistency with established scientific theories. The idea of morphic resonance is also seen as lacking scientific credibility because it is overly vague and unfalsifiable. Sheldrake&#x27;s experimental methods have been criticised for being poorly designed and subject to experimenter bias. His analyses of results have also drawn criticism.

Alex Gomez-Marin denies that Sheldrake&#x27;s basic idea is unfalsifiable, but no conclusive experiments have been performed since mainstream scientists do not wish to get involved in such experiments.

=== &quot;The Presence of the Past&quot; (1988)===
In &quot;The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature&quot; (1988), Sheldrake expands on his morphic resonance hypothesis and marshals experimental evidence that he says supports it. The book was reviewed favourably in &quot;New Scientist&quot; by historian Theodore Roszak, who called it &quot;engaging, provocative&quot; and &quot;a tour de force.&quot; When it was reissued in 2011 with those quotes on the front cover, &quot;New Scientist&quot; remarked, &quot;Back then, Roszak gave Sheldrake the benefit of the doubt. Today, attitudes have hardened and Sheldrake is seen as standing firmly on the wilder shores of science,&quot; adding that if &quot;New Scientist&quot; were to review the reissue, the book&#x27;s publisher &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be mining it for promotional purposes.&quot;

In a 1988 review of the book in &quot;The Times&quot;, David E. H. Jones criticised the hypothesis as magical thinking and pseudoscience, saying that morphic resonance &quot;is so vast and formless that it could easily be made to explain anything, or to dodge round any opposing argument ... Sheldrake has sadly aligned himself with those fantasists who, from the depths of their armchairs, dream up whole new grandiose theories of space and time to revolutionize all science, drape their woolly generalizations over every phenomenon they can think of, and then start looking round for whatever scraps of evidence that seem to them to be in their favour.&quot; Jones argued that without confirmatory experimental evidence, &quot;the whole unwieldy and redundant structure of [Sheldrake&#x27;s] theory falls to Occam&#x27;s Razor.&quot;

=== &quot;The Rebirth of Nature&quot; (1991) ===
Published in 1991, Sheldrake&#x27;s &quot;The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God&quot; addresses the subject of New Age consciousness and related topics. A column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the book &quot;seeks to restore the pre-Enlightenment notion that nature is &#x27;alive&#x27;,&quot; quoting Sheldrake as saying that &quot;indeterminism, spontaneity and creativity have re-emerged throughout the natural world&quot; and that &quot;mystic, animistic and religious ways of thinking can no longer be kept at bay.&quot; The book was reviewed by James Lovelock in &quot;Nature&quot;, who argued that &quot;the theory of formative causation makes testable predictions,&quot; noting that &quot;nothing has yet been reported which would divert the mainstream of science. ... Even if it is nonsense ... recognizing the need for fruitful errors, I do not regard the book as dangerous.&quot;

===&quot;Seven Experiments That Could Change the World&quot; (1994) ===
In 1994, Sheldrake proposed a list of &quot;Seven Experiments That Could Change the World&quot;, subtitled &quot;A do-it-yourself guide to revolutionary science.&quot; He encouraged laypeople to conduct research and argued that experiments similar to his own could be conducted with limited expense.

Music critic of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Mark Edwards reviewed the book positively, arguing that Sheldrake &quot;challenges the complacent certainty of scientists,&quot; and that his ideas &quot;sounded ridiculous ... as long as your thinking is constrained by the current scientific orthodoxy.&quot;

David Sharp, writing in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, said that the experiments testing paranormal phenomena carried the &quot;risk of positive publication bias,&quot; and that the scientific community &quot;would have to think again if some of these suggestions were convincingly confirmed.&quot; Sharp encouraged readers (medical professionals) to &quot;at least read Sheldrake, even try one of his experiments—but pay very close attention to your methods section.&quot; Sharp doubted whether &quot;a bunch of enthusiastic amateurs [was] going to persuade sceptics,&quot; and noted that &quot;orthodox science will need a lot of convincing.&quot;

Science journalist Nigel Hawkes, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, said that Sheldrake was &quot;trying to bridge the gap between phenomenalism and science,&quot; and suggested that dogs could appear to have psychic abilities when they were actually relying on more conventional senses. He concluded: &quot;whether scientists will be willing to take [Sheldrake] seriously is ... [a question] that need not concern most readers. While I do not think this book will change the world, it will cause plenty of harmless fun.&quot;

=== &quot;Dogs That Know When Their Owners are Coming Home&quot; (1999)===

&quot;Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home&quot;, published in 1999, covers his research into proposed telepathy between humans and animals, particularly dogs. Sheldrake suggests that such interspecies telepathy is a real phenomenon and that morphic fields are responsible for it.

The book is in three sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, including animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of dogs and cats that seemed to anticipate their owners&#x27; return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes for half an hour or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner&#x27;s absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when she was on her way home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. He performed 12 more tests, in which the dog&#x27;s owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. He also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.

Before the publication of &quot;Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home&quot;, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as an explanation for the dog&#x27;s behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake&#x27;s conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake&#x27;s observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner&#x27;s return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner&#x27;s return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman&#x27;s tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.

Reviewing the book, Susan Blackmore criticised Sheldrake for comparing the 12 tests of random duration—which were all less than an hour long—to the initial tests where the dog may have been responding to patterns in the owner&#x27;s journeys. Blackmore interpreted the results of the randomised tests as starting with a period where the dog &quot;settles down and does not bother to go to the window,&quot; and then showing that the longer the owner was away, the more the dog went to look.

===&quot;The Sense of Being Stared At&quot; (2003)===
Sheldrake&#x27;s &quot;The Sense of Being Stared At&quot; explores telepathy, precognition, and the &quot;psychic staring effect.&quot; It reported on an experiment Sheldrake conducted where blindfolded subjects guessed whether persons were staring at them or at another target. He reported subjects exhibiting a weak sense of being stared at, but no sense of not being stared at, and attributed the results to morphic resonance. He reported a hit rate of 53.1%, describing two subjects as &quot;nearly always right, scoring way above chance levels.&quot;

Several independent experimenters were unable to find evidence beyond statistical randomness that people could tell they were being stared at, with some saying that there were design flaws in Sheldrake&#x27;s experiments, such as using test sequences with &quot;relatively few long runs and many alternations&quot; instead of truly randomised patterns. In 2005, Michael Shermer expressed concern over confirmation bias and experimenter bias in the tests, and concluded that Sheldrake&#x27;s claim was unfalsifiable.

David Jay Brown, who conducted some of the experiments for Sheldrake, states that one of the subjects who was reported as having the highest hit rates was under the influence of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy) during the trials.

=== &quot;The Science Delusion&quot; (&quot;Science Set Free&quot;) (2012)===
&quot;The Science Delusion&quot;, published in the US as &quot;Science Set Free: 10 Paths to New Discovery&quot;, summarises much of Sheldrake&#x27;s previous work and encapsulates it into a broader critique of philosophical materialism, with the title apparently mimicking that of &quot;The God Delusion&quot; by one of his critics, Richard Dawkins.

In the book, Sheldrake proposes a number of questions as the theme of each chapter that seek to elaborate on his central premise that science is predicated on the belief that the nature of reality is fully understood, with only minor details needing to be filled in. This &quot;delusion&quot; is what Sheldrake argues has turned science into a series of dogmas grounded in philosophical materialism rather than an open-minded approach to investigating phenomena. He argues that many powerful taboos circumscribe what scientists can legitimately direct their attention towards. The mainstream view of modern science is that it proceeds by methodological naturalism and does not require philosophical materialism.

Sheldrake questions conservation of energy; he calls it a &quot;standard scientific dogma,&quot; says that perpetual motion devices and inedia should be investigated as possible phenomena, and has said that &quot;the evidence for energy conservation in living organisms is weak.&quot; He argues in favour of alternative medicine and psychic phenomena, saying that their recognition as legitimate is impeded by a &quot;scientific priesthood&quot; with an &quot;authoritarian mentality.&quot; Citing his earlier &quot;psychic staring effect&quot; experiments and other reasons, he says that minds are not confined to brains and that &quot;liberating minds from confinement in heads is like being released from prison.&quot; He suggests that DNA is insufficient to explain inheritance, and that inheritance of form and behaviour is mediated through morphic resonance. He also promotes morphic resonance in broader fashion as an explanation for other phenomena such as memory.

Reviews were mixed. Anti-reductionist philosopher Mary Midgley, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, welcomed it as &quot;a new mind-body paradigm&quot; to address what she called &quot;the unlucky fact that our current form of mechanistic materialism rests on muddled, outdated notions of matter.&quot; Philosopher Martin Cohen, a famous critic of esotericism in science, wrote in &quot;The Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; that &quot;[t]here is a lot to be said for debunking orthodox science&#x27;s pretensions to be on the verge of fitting the last grain of information into its towering edifice of universal knowledge&quot;, while also noting that Sheldrake &quot;goes a bit too far here and there, as in promoting his morphic resonance theory.&quot;

Bryan Appleyard writing in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; commented that Sheldrake was &quot;at his most incisive&quot; when making a &quot;broad critique of contemporary science&quot; and &quot;scientism,&quot; but on Sheldrake&#x27;s &quot;own scientific theories&quot; Appleyard noted that &quot;morphic resonance is widely derided and narrowly supported. Most of the experimental evidence is contested, though Sheldrake argues there are &#x27;statistically significant&#x27; results.&quot; Appleyard called it &quot;highly speculative&quot; and was unsure &quot;whether it makes sense or not.&quot;

Other reviews were less favourable. &quot;New Scientist&quot;&#x27;s deputy editor Graham Lawton characterised &quot;Science Set Free&quot; as &quot;woolly credulousness&quot; and chided Sheldrake for &quot;uncritically embracing all kinds of fringe ideas.&quot; A review in &quot;Philosophy Now&quot; called the book &quot;disturbingly eccentric,&quot; combining &quot;a disorderly collage of scientific fact and opinion with an intrusive yet disjunctive metaphysical programme.&quot;

=== &quot;Science and Spiritual Practices&quot; (2017) ===
Reviews for the book were mostly positive. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as a &quot;grounded and inspiring approach to appreciating the benefits of both science and religion&quot;. Adam Ford, reviewing the book for the &quot;Church Times&quot;, describes it as a &quot;useful and very clear introduction to the practice of meditation&quot; combined with a how-to guide on the &quot;healing and happiness-creating power of gratitude&quot;.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed the book as having &quot;accessible suggestions&quot; and &quot;clear arguments&quot;, while noting that &quot;a few fuzzy moments, including reliance on many...overly speculative accounts&quot; do not prevent the work from being &quot;otherwise convincing&quot; and &quot;a good case for reincorporating bygone spiritual habits.&quot;

===&quot;Ways to Go Beyond and Why They Work&quot; (2019)===
Reviews for the book were mixed. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, journalist Steven Poole called Sheldrake&#x27;s writing &quot;very engaging&quot; and said his defense of prayer worked &quot;sometimes, but not always&quot; and was &quot;not really good enough&quot;. Veterinary surgeon and barrister Charles A. Foster, writing in Literary Review, called the book &quot;a very mixed bag&quot; but also &quot;funny, wise, [and] full of whimsical weirdness&quot;.

Writing in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, anthropologist Jonathan Benthall called the book &quot;an affable, erudite manual to show how life need not be boring&quot;, and Sheldrake&#x27;s arguments &quot;soft at the edges, sometimes presenting his hypotheses as facts&quot;.

== Public reception ==
Sheldrake&#x27;s ideas have been discussed in academic journals and books. His work has also received popular coverage through newspapers, radio, television and speaking engagements. The attention he receives has raised concerns that it adversely affects the public understanding of science. Some have accused Sheldrake of self-promotion, with Steven Rose commenting, &quot;for the inventors of such hypotheses the rewards include a degree of instant fame which is harder to achieve by the humdrum pursuit of more conventional science.&quot;

=== Academic debate ===
A variety of responses to Sheldrake&#x27;s ideas have appeared in prominent scientific publications.

Sheldrake and theoretical physicist David Bohm published a dialogue in 1982 in which they compared Sheldrake&#x27;s ideas to Bohm&#x27;s implicate order. In 1997, physicist Hans-Peter Dürr speculated about Sheldrake&#x27;s work in relation to modern physics.

Following the publication of &quot;A New Science of Life&quot;, &quot;New Scientist&quot; sponsored a competition to devise empirical tests for morphic resonance. The winning idea involved learning Turkish nursery rhymes, with psychologist and broadcaster Sue Blackmore&#x27;s entry involving babies&#x27; behaviour coming second. Blackmore found the results did not support morphic resonance.

In 2005, the &quot;Journal of Consciousness Studies&quot; devoted a special issue to Sheldrake&#x27;s work on the sense of being stared at. For this issue, the editor could not follow the journal&#x27;s standard peer-review process because &quot;making successful blind peer review a condition of publication would in this case have killed the project at the outset.&quot; The issue thus featured several articles by Sheldrake, followed by the open peer review, to which Sheldrake then responded. Writing in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Michael Shermer rated the peer commentaries, and noted that the more supportive reviews came from those who had affiliations with less mainstream institutions.

Sheldrake denies that DNA contains a recipe for morphological development. He and developmental biologist Lewis Wolpert have made a scientific wager about the importance of DNA in the developing organism. Wolpert bet Sheldrake &quot;a case of fine port&quot; that &quot;By 1 May 2029, given the genome of a fertilised egg of an animal or plant, we will be able to predict in at least one case all the details of the organism that develops from it, including any abnormalities.&quot; The Royal Society will be asked to determine the winner if the result is not obvious.

====&quot;A book for burning?&quot;====
In September 1981, &quot;Nature&quot; published an editorial about &quot;A New Science of Life&quot; entitled &quot;A book for burning?&quot; Written by the journal&#x27;s senior editor, John Maddox, the editorial commented:

Maddox argued that Sheldrake&#x27;s hypothesis was not testable or &quot;falsifiable in Popper&#x27;s sense,&quot; referring to the philosopher Karl Popper. He said Sheldrake&#x27;s proposals for testing his hypothesis were &quot;time-consuming, inconclusive in the sense that it will always be possible to account for another morphogenetic field and impractical.&quot; In the editorial, Maddox ultimately rejected the suggestion that the book should be burned. Nonetheless, the title of the piece garnered widespread publicity. In a subsequent issue, &quot;Nature&quot; published several letters expressing disapproval of the editorial, including one from physicist Brian Josephson, who criticised Maddox for &quot;a failure to admit even the possibility that genuine physical facts may exist which lie outside the scope of current scientific descriptions.&quot;

In 1983, an editorial in &quot;The Guardian&quot; compared the &quot;petulance of wrath of the scientific establishment&quot; aimed against Sheldrake with the Galileo affair and Lysenkoism. Responding in the same paper, Brian Charlesworth defended the scientific establishment, affirming that &quot;the ultimate test of a scientific theory is its conformity with the observations and experiments&quot; and that &quot;vitalistic and Lamarckian ideas which [&quot;The Guardian&quot;] seem to regard so highly have repeatedly failed this test.&quot;

In a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1988, a scientist from Glasgow University referred to the title &quot;A book for burning?&quot; as &quot;posing the question to attract attention&quot; and criticised the &quot;perpetuation of the myth that Maddox ever advocated the burning of Sheldrake&#x27;s book.&quot; In 1999, Maddox characterised his 1981 editorial as &quot;injudicious,&quot; saying that even though it concluded that Sheldrake&#x27;s book

should not be burned ... but put firmly in its place among the literature of intellectual aberration. ... The publicists for Sheldrake&#x27;s publishers were nevertheless delighted with the piece, using it to suggest that the Establishment (&quot;Nature&quot;) was again up to its old trick of suppressing uncomfortable truths. An editor for &quot;Nature&quot; said in 2009 that Maddox&#x27;s reference to book burning backfired.

In 2012, Sheldrake described his time after Maddox&#x27;s review as being &quot;exactly like a papal excommunication. From that moment on, I became a very dangerous person to know for scientists.&quot;

====Sheldrake and Steven Rose====
During 1987 and 1988 Sheldrake contributed several pieces to &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Body and Soul&quot; column. In one of these, he wrote that the idea that &quot;memories were stored in our brains&quot; was &quot;only a theory&quot; and &quot;despite decades of research, the phenomenon of memory remains mysterious.&quot; This provoked a response by Steven Rose, a neuroscientist from the Open University, who criticised Sheldrake for being &quot;a researcher trained in another discipline&quot; (botany) for not &quot;respect[ing] the data collected by neuroscientists before begin[ning] to offer us alternative explanations,&quot; and accused Sheldrake of &quot;ignoring or denying&quot; &quot;massive evidence,&quot; and arguing that &quot;neuroscience over the past two decades has shown that memories are stored in specific changes in brain cells.&quot; Giving an example of experiments on chicks, Rose asserted &quot;egregious errors that Sheldrake makes to bolster his case that demands a new vague but all-embracing theory to resolve.&quot;

Sheldrake responded to Rose&#x27;s article, stating that there was experimental evidence that showed that &quot;memories can survive the destruction of the putative memory traces.&quot; Rose responded, asking Sheldrake to &quot;get his facts straight,&quot; explaining the research and concluding that &quot;there is no way that this straightforward and impressive body of evidence can be taken to imply that memories are not in the brain, still less that the brain is tuning into some indeterminate, undefined, resonating and extra-corporeal field.&quot;

In his next column, Sheldrake again attacked Rose for following &quot;materialism,&quot; and argued that quantum physics had &quot;overturned&quot; materialism, and suggested that &quot;memories may turn out to depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces.&quot; Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake&#x27;s &quot;latest muddled diatribe,&quot; defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose&#x27;s explanation with an &quot;absurd rhetorical comparison,&quot; asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism, and argued that &quot;being roughly right about great many things has given [materialists] the confidence to be far more open minded than he is prepared to give them credit for.&quot;

In 1990, Sheldrake and Rose agreed to and arranged a test of the morphic resonance hypothesis using chicks. They were unable to agree on the intended joint research paper reporting their results, instead publishing separate and conflicting interpretations. Sheldrake published a paper stating that the results matched his prediction that day-old chicks would be influenced by the experiences of previous batches of day-old chicks—&quot;From the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, the results of this experiment are encouraging&quot;—and called for further research. Rose wrote that morphic resonance was a &quot;hypothesis disconfirmed.&quot; He also made further criticisms of morphic resonance, and stated that &quot;the experience of this collaboration has convinced me in practice, Sheldrake is so committed to his hypothesis that it is very hard to envisage the circumstances in which he would accept its disconfirmation.&quot; Rose asked Patrick Bateson to analyse the data, and Bateson offered his opinion that Sheldrake&#x27;s interpretation of the data was &quot;misleading&quot; and attributable to experimenter effects.

Sheldrake responded to Rose&#x27;s paper by describing it as &quot;polemic&quot; and &quot;aggressive tone and extravagant rhetoric&quot; and concluding: &quot;The results of this experiment do not disconfirm the hypothesis of formative causation, as Rose claims. They are consistent with it.&quot;

=== On television ===
Sheldrake was the subject of an episode of &quot;Heretics of Science&quot;, a six-part documentary series broadcast on BBC2 in 1994. In this episode, John Maddox discussed &quot;A book for burning?,&quot; his 1981 &quot;Nature&quot; editorial review of Sheldrake&#x27;s book, &quot;A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance&quot;. Maddox said that morphic resonance &quot;is not a scientific theory. Sheldrake is putting forward magic instead of science, and that can be condemned with exactly the language that the popes used to condemn Galileo, and for the same reasons: it is heresy.&quot; The broadcast repeatedly displayed footage of book burning, sometimes accompanied by audio of a crowd chanting &quot;heretic.&quot; Biologist Steven Rose criticised the broadcast for focusing on Maddox&#x27;s rhetoric as if it was &quot;all that mattered.&quot; &quot;There wasn&#x27;t much sense of the scientific or metascientific issues at stake,&quot; Rose said.

An experiment involving measuring the time for subjects to recognise hidden images, with morphic resonance being posited to aid in recognition, was conducted in 1984 by the BBC popular science programme &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. In the outcome of the experiment, one set of data yielded positive results and another set yielded negative results.

===Public debates and lectures===
Sheldrake debated with biologist Lewis Wolpert on the existence of telepathy in 2004 at the Royal Society of Arts in London. Sheldrake argued for telepathy while Wolpert argued that telepathy fits Irving Langmuir&#x27;s definition of pathological science and that the evidence for telepathy has not been persuasive. Reporting on the event, &quot;New Scientist&quot; said &quot;it was clear the audience saw Wolpert as no more than a killjoy. (...) There are sound reasons for doubting Sheldrake&#x27;s data. One is that some parapsychology experimenters have an uncanny knack of finding the effect they are looking for. There is no suggestion of fraud, but something is going on, and science demands that it must be understood before conclusions can be drawn about the results.&quot;

In 2006, Sheldrake spoke at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science about experimental results on telepathy replicated by &quot;a 1980s girl band,&quot; drawing criticism from Peter Atkins, Lord Winston, and Richard Wiseman. The Royal Society also reacted to the event, saying, &quot;Modern science is based on a rigorous evidence-based process involving experiment and observation. The results and interpretations should always be exposed to robust peer review.&quot;

In April 2008, Sheldrake was stabbed by a man during a lecture in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The man told a reporter that he thought Sheldrake had been using him as a &quot;guinea pig&quot; in telepathic mind control experiments for over five years. Sheldrake suffered a wound to the leg and has recovered, while his assailant was found &quot;guilty but mentally ill.&quot;

In January 2013, Sheldrake gave a TEDx lecture at TEDxWhitechapel in East London roughly summarising ideas from his book, &quot;The Science Delusion&quot;. In his talk, he said that modern science rests on ten dogmas that &quot;fall apart&quot; upon examination and promoted his hypothesis of morphic resonance. According to a statement by TED staff, TED&#x27;s scientific advisors &quot;questioned whether his list is a fair description of scientific assumptions&quot; and believed that &quot;there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake&#x27;s more radical claims, such as his theory of morphic resonance.&quot; The advisors recommended that the talk &quot;not be distributed without being framed with caution.&quot; The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were &quot;simply not true&quot; and that Sheldrake&#x27;s talk was &quot;up on our website.&quot;

In November 2013, Sheldrake gave a lecture at the Oxford Union outlining his claims, made in &quot;The Science Delusion&quot;, that modern science has become constrained by dogma, particularly in physics.

===In popular culture===
Between 1989 and 1999, Sheldrake, ethnobotanist Terence McKenna and mathematician Ralph Abraham recorded a series of discussions exploring diverse topics relating to the &quot;world soul&quot; and evolution. These resulted in a number of books based on the discussions: &quot;Trialogues at the Edge of the West: Chaos, Creativity and the Resacralization of the World&quot; (1992), &quot;The Evolutionary Mind: Trialogues at the Edge of the Unthinkable&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Evolutionary Mind: Conversations on Science, Imagination &amp; Spirit&quot; (2005). In an interview for the book &quot;Conversations on the Edge of the Apocalypse&quot;, Sheldrake says he believes the use of psychedelic drugs &quot;can reveal a world of consciousness and interconnection&quot;, which he says he has experienced. Alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra is a supporter of Sheldrake&#x27;s work.

Sheldrake&#x27;s work was amongst those cited in a faux research paper written by Alan Sokal and submitted to &quot;Social Text&quot;. In 1996, the journal published the paper as if it represented real scientific research, an event that has come to be known as the Sokal affair. Sokal later said that he had suggested in the hoax paper that &#x27;morphogenetic fields&#x27; constituted a cutting-edge theory of quantum gravity, adding that &quot;This connection [was] pure invention; even Sheldrake makes no such claim.&quot;

Sheldrake has been described as a New Age author, but does not endorse certain New Age interpretations of his ideas.

The 2009 &quot;Zero Escape&quot; video game &quot;Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors&quot; was inspired by Sheldrake&#x27;s morphogenetic field theories.

==Origin and philosophy of morphic resonance==
Among his early influences Sheldrake cites &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962) by Thomas Kuhn. He has said the book led him to view contemporary scientific understanding of life as simply a paradigm, which he called &quot;the mechanistic theory of life.&quot; Reading Kuhn&#x27;s work, Sheldrake says, focused his mind on how scientific paradigms can change.

Sheldrake says that although there are similarities between morphic resonance and Hinduism&#x27;s akashic records, he first conceived of the idea while at Cambridge, before his travel to India, where he later developed it. He attributes the origin of his idea to two influences: his studies of the holistic tradition in biology, and French philosopher Henri Bergson&#x27;s 1896 book &quot;Matter and Memory&quot;. He says he took Bergson&#x27;s concept of memories not being materially embedded in the brain and generalised it to morphic resonance, where memories are not only immaterial but also under the influence of the collective memories of similar organisms. While his colleagues at Cambridge were not receptive to the idea, Sheldrake found the opposite to be true in India. He recounts his Indian colleagues saying, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing new in this, it was all known millennia ago to the ancient rishis.&quot; Sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance as a convergence between Western and Eastern thought, yet found by himself first in Western philosophy.

Sheldrake has also noted similarities between morphic resonance and Carl Jung&#x27;s collective unconscious, with regard to collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, which Jung called archetypes. But whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms &quot;mechanistic biology.&quot;

Lewis Wolpert, one of Sheldrake&#x27;s critics, has described morphic resonance as an updated Drieschian vitalism.

== Personal life ==
Sheldrake is married to therapist, voice teacher and author Jill Purce. They have two sons, biologist Merlin Sheldrake and musician Cosmo Sheldrake. Merlin Sheldrake is a mycologist and author of &quot;Entangled Life: How fungi make our worlds, change our minds and shape our futures.&quot;

Sheldrake is a practising Anglican. He has said that he studied with a Sufi teacher and practised Sufism while he was in India. Sheldrake reported &quot;being drawn back to a Christian path&quot; during his time in India.

<doc id="142409" wikidata="Q216292" url="?curid=142409" title="Session layer">
<text>In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the session layer is layer 5.

The session layer provides the mechanism for opening, closing and managing a session between end-user application processes, i.e., a semi-permanent dialogue. Communication sessions consist of requests and responses that occur between applications. Session-layer services are commonly used in application environments that make use of remote procedure calls (RPCs).

An example of a session-layer protocol is the OSI protocol suite session-layer protocol, also known as X.225 or ISO 8327. In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. It provides for either full duplex or half-duplex operation and provides synchronization points in the stream of exchanged messages.

Other examples of session layer implementations include Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) – the AppleTalk protocol that coordinates the name binding process, and Session Control Protocol (SCP) – the DECnet Phase IV session-layer protocol.

Within the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, the session layer responds to service requests from the presentation layer and issues service requests to the transport layer.

==Services==

=== Connection establishment and release ===

At the minimum, the session layer allows the two sides to establish and use a connection, called a session, and allows orderly release of the connection.

In the OSI model, the transport layer is not responsible for an orderly release of a connection. Instead, the session layer is responsible for that. However, in modern TCP/IP networks, TCP already provides orderly closing of connections at the transport layer.

After a session connection is released, the underlying transport connection may be reused for another session connection. Also, a session connection may make use of multiple consecutive transport connections. For example, if, during a session, the underlying transport connection has a failure, the session layer may try to re-establish a transport connection to continue the session.

=== Dialogue control ===

The session layer may provide three different dialogue types - two way simultaneous (full-duplex), two way alternate (half-duplex), and one way (simplex). It also provides the mechanisms to negotiate the type of the dialogue, and controls which side has the &quot;turn&quot; or &quot;token&quot; to send data or to perform some control functions.

Dialogue control is not implemented in TCP/IP, and is left to the application layer to handle, if necessary. In the widely-used HTTP/1.1 protocol, the client and the server typically work in a half-duplex way. HTTP/1.1 also supports HTTP pipelining for full-duplex operation, but many servers/proxies couldn&#x27;t handle it correctly, and there was no dialogue negotiation mechanism to check whether full-duplex is usable or not, so its support was eventually dropped by most browsers.

=== Synchronization points and resynchronization ===

The session layer may also allow the two sides to insert &quot;synchronization points&quot; into the dialogue, and allow them to do a &quot;resynchronization&quot;, which aborts the current transmission, sets the synchronization point to a certain value, and restarts transmission from that point.

This may be used in real-time audio/video transmission. Synchronization points can be used to insert timestamps to the data flow, and a resynchronization may be used to reset the transmission to start from a new timestamp. For example, if the video stream lags behind the audio stream too much, the receiving side may issue a resynchronization request on the video stream, restarting its transmission from a later timestamp.

This may also be used by the application to do checkpointing. Synchronization points can be used to indicate that a checkpoint has been committed by the application, and after an application crash or a power failure, a resynchronization can be used to indicate that the application has recovered from a checkpoint and the transmission can be resumed from that point.

This may also be used to interrupt / resume a dialogue at any time, not due to an application failure, but as planned by the application. The application may interrupt a dialogue, start another dialogue in the same session, and resume the previous dialogue in the same session or in another session.

The session layer may also provide explicit support for managing multiple interruptible dialogues over one or more sessions. These dialogues are called &quot;activities&quot;. Activities can be interrupted and resumed explicitly. Compared to implicitly interrupting and resuming dialogues by resynchronization, activity support gives the application simpler control of these dialogues.

==Comparison with TCP/IP model==
The TCP/IP reference model does not concern itself with the OSI model&#x27;s details of application or transport protocol semantics and therefore does not consider a session layer. OSI&#x27;s session management in connection with the typical transport protocols (TCP, SCTP), is contained in the transport-layer protocols, or otherwise considered the realm of the application layer protocols. TCP/IP&#x27;s layers are &quot;descriptions&quot; of operating scopes (application, host-to-host, network, link) and not detailed &quot;prescriptions&quot; of operating procedures or data semantics.

<text>Quiz Show is a 1994 American historical mystery-drama film directed and produced by Robert Redford. Dramatizing the &quot;Twenty-One&quot; quiz show scandals of the 1950s, the screenplay by Paul Attanasio adapts the memoirs of Richard N. Goodwin, a U.S. Congressional lawyer who investigated the accusations of game-fixing by show producers. The film chronicles the rise and fall of popular contestant Charles Van Doren after the fixed loss of Herb Stempel and Goodwin&#x27;s subsequent probe.

The film stars John Turturro as Stempel, Rob Morrow as Goodwin, and Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren. Paul Scofield, David Paymer, Hank Azaria, Martin Scorsese, Mira Sorvino, and Christopher McDonald play supporting roles. The real Goodwin and Stempel served as technical advisors to the production.

The film received generally positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including a Best Picture Oscar nomination (among three others) and several Golden Globe Awards, but was a financial disappointment, grossing $52.2 million against a $31 million budget.

== Plot ==
In 1958, the questions and answers to be used for the latest broadcast of NBC&#x27;s popular quiz show &quot;Twenty-One&quot; are transported from a secure bank vault to the studio. The evening&#x27;s main attraction is Queens resident Herb Stempel, the reigning champion, who correctly answers every single question he is asked. Eventually, both the network and the program&#x27;s corporate sponsor, the supplementary tonic Geritol, begin to fear that Stempel&#x27;s approval ratings are beginning to level out, and decide that the show would benefit from new talent.

Producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman are surprised when Columbia University instructor Charles Van Doren, son of a prominent literary family, visits their office to audition for a different, less difficult show by the same producers, &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;. Realizing that they have found an ideal challenger for Stempel, they offer to ask the same questions during the show which Van Doren correctly answered during his audition. He refuses, but when he nears a game-winning 21 points on the show, he is asked one of the questions from his audition. After a moment of moral indecision, he gives the correct answer. Stempel deliberately misses an easy question and loses, having been promised a future in television if he does so.

In the subsequent weeks, Van Doren&#x27;s winning streak makes him a national celebrity, but he reluctantly buckles under the pressure and allows Enright and Freedman to start giving him the answers. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his prize money to an unscrupulous bookie, begins threatening legal action against NBC after weeks pass without his return to television. He visits New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan, who convenes a grand jury to look into his allegations.

Richard Goodwin, a young Congressional lawyer, learns that the grand jury findings have been sealed and travels to New York City to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect that &quot;Twenty-One&quot; is a fixed operation. Stempel&#x27;s volatile personality damages his credibility, and nobody else seems willing to confirm that the show is fixed. Fearing Goodwin will give up the investigation, Stempel confesses that he was fed the correct answers during his run on the show, and insists that Van Doren must have been involved as well. Another former contestant gives Goodwin a set of answers that he mailed to himself two days before his quiz show appearance, which Goodwin takes to be corroborating evidence.

A guilt-ridden Van Doren deliberately loses, but NBC offers him a lucrative contract to appear as a special correspondent on the morning &quot;Today&quot; show. The House Committee for Legislative Oversight convenes a hearing, at which Goodwin presents his evidence of the quiz show&#x27;s corruption. Stempel testifies at the hearing but fails to convince the committee, and both NBC network head Robert Kintner and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome deny any knowledge of &quot;Twenty-One&quot; being rigged. Subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits his role in the deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from &quot;Today&quot; and that Columbia&#x27;s board of trustees will be asking for his resignation.

Goodwin believes that he is close to a victory against Geritol and NBC, but realizes that Enright and Freedman will not jeopardize their own futures in television by turning against their bosses. He silently watches the producers&#x27; testimony, vindicating the sponsors and the network from any wrongdoing, and taking full responsibility for rigging the show. Disgusted, he steps outside and sees Van Doren, who waves at him before boarding a taxi.

==Cast==
== Historical accuracy ==
Although much of &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is generally accurate based on the actual events, its use of artistic license generated controversy and criticism (especially in regard to character changes) by critics and real-life figures involved with the scandal.

The artistic licenses included compressing three years of scandal into one, changing the location of Van Doren&#x27;s first meeting with Goodwin, altering the start time of Goodwin&#x27;s investigation, and making Van Doren&#x27;s choice to incorrectly answer a question his own instead of that of NBC.

The fateful episode in which Van Doren defeated Stempel is inaccurately portrayed. In the film, Stempel&#x27;s intentionally incorrect response about &quot;Marty&quot; is in response to a three-point question with the score 18-10 in his favor. In reality, the question was worth five points and the score was 16-10. The film also presents this as the deciding moment of the game, with Van Doren correctly answering the next question about the Civil War to win. Van Doren&#x27;s next question was actually about Pizarro&#x27;s conquest of the Incas, and Stempel correctly replied to his next question about the voyages of Christopher Columbus. This forced a 21-21 tie and a new game to determine the winner. The incorrect answer that doomed Stempel occurred in the second game in response to a question about newspaperman William Allen White. Both Van Doren and Stempel then correctly answered a question about the wives of King Henry VIII, and the game ended when Van Doren elected to stop, winning by a score of 18-10.

The film&#x27;s magnification of the role that &quot;Twenty-One&quot; and its producer Albert Freedman played in the scandal was criticized by Jeff Kisslehoff, who wrote &quot;The Box: An Oral History of Television, 1920-1961&quot;, as well as Freedman himself. Kisslehoff argued that the dishonest practice originated in the radio era when players were overtly coached. Goodwin&#x27;s role in the investigation was less important than as portrayed in the film; he only became involved two years after &quot;Twenty-One&quot; ended syndication, and a collection of information was handled by publications and assistant district attorneys in New York City. Joe Stone, a congressional committee consultant who investigated the scandal for four years, was angered about the screenplay&#x27;s spotlight on Goodwin and the fact that Goodwin accepted most of the credit for uncovering the scandal when the film was released. Goodwin&#x27;s wife Doris Kearns Goodwin apologized to Stone about the film.

Other dramatic liberties involved simplifications, such as the character of Van Doren, who is a &quot;shallow icon&quot; devoid of the ambiguities of the actual Van Doren, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; analyzed. In a July 2008 edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Van Doren wrote about the events depicted in the film. He agreed with many of the details but wrote that his girlfriend at the time of his &quot;Twenty-One&quot; appearances was not depicted in the film. He also noted that he continued teaching after the scandal, contradicting the film&#x27;s epilogue that states that he never returned to academia.

For legal reasons, the name of Matthew Rosenhaus, CEO of the company that owned Geritol, was changed to Martin Rittenhome, and his personality reflected that of Charles Revson, who was the president of cosmetics brand Revlon that had sponsored another quiz show involved in the scandal, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; (1955–1958).

== Production ==
=== Background ===
When Robert Redford first saw &quot;Twenty-One&quot; in the late 1950s, he was in his early 20s taking art and acting classes in New York. He recalled when he first saw Van Doren on the show, &quot;Watching him and the other contestants was irresistible. The actor in me looked at the show and felt I was watching other actors. It was too much to believe, but at the same time, I never doubted the show. I hadn&#x27;t had evidence television could trick us. But the merchant mentality was already taking hold, and as we know now, there&#x27;s little morality there.&quot; Redford described the scandal as &quot;really the first in a series of scandals . . . that have left us numbed, unsure of what or who to believe.&quot;

A 1992 documentary on the scandal produced by Julian Krainin as an installment of the PBS series &quot;American Experience&quot; predated the film.

=== Writing ===
&quot;Quiz Show&quot; is based on a chapter of the book &quot;Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties&quot; (1988) by Richard N. Goodwin, who also was one of the film&#x27;s many producers. Paul Attanasio began writing the screenplay in 1990, joining immediately for the subject matter&#x27;s &quot;complex ironies,&quot; such as with its main characters. Completing many drafts over the course of three years, Attanasio wrote the script by watching clips of &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, reading old articles about the scandal, learning about the 1950s television landscape at the Museum of Broadcasting and meeting with Goodwin. Redford researched the topic by reading Dan Wakefield&#x27;s book &quot;New York in the Fifties&quot; and brought Wakefield to the film set as an advisor who also was given a cameo appearance. Redford had known Goodwin since appearing in &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972), and he helped Attanasio integrate Goodwin&#x27;s personality into the script.

Because the story lacked a protagonist, Attanasio employed &quot;shifting points of view&quot; while maintaining a through line, which complicated the writing of the screenplay. In depicting the themes of ethnic conflict between White Anglo-Saxon Protestants and Jewish characters, Attanasio borrowed from his experiences as a member of an Italian-American family. His relatives were outraged by the stereotypical depiction of Italians as loudmouth gangsters in the media. He also integrated the duplicitous personalities of those with whom he had worked in the film industry in order to incorporate themes of disillusion.

=== Development ===
Redford first read a rough draft after completing production of &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992), &quot;looking for something edgier, faster-paced, urban, where I could move the camera more.&quot; Barry Levinson&#x27;s Baltimore Pictures and TriStar Pictures began development of a film project based on the quiz-show scandal, which proved difficult to sell because of its uncommercial style and subject matter. TriStar placed it in turnaround in September 1992, and it was then moved to Walt Disney Studios, which invested $20 million into the budget and launched the project into production through its Hollywood Pictures label in Spring 1993 after Redford agreed to direct. Although Disney offered Charles Van Doren $100,000 to act as a consultant, he declined.

=== Casting ===
Casting took place in New York in May 1993. Redford originally planned for an American actor to play Van Doren, but after auditioning several actors such as William Baldwin, he failed to find the &quot;combination of elements&quot; required for the character and awarded the part to British actor Ralph Fiennes. To prepare for the role, Fiennes viewed clips of Van Doren on &quot;Twenty-One&quot; and televised interviews with him, and he also visited Van Doren&#x27;s Cornwall, Connecticut home. Although the men did not meet, Fiennes gained a sense of atmosphere from Van Doren&#x27;s home. Paul Newman was initially considered for the role of Mark Van Doren, but he declined. In May 1993, Chris O&#x27;Donnell was reported to be talking with Redford about appearing in the film, but he was not cast.

Turturro found it easy to assume the Stempel&#x27;s character, but he gained 25 pounds for the role and altered his voice to mimic Stempel&#x27;s. After his initial success in &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; (1990–1995), Rob Morrow was offered several film roles but rejected them until he accepted the offer for &quot;Quiz Show&quot;: &quot;I knew this was the one. It had the cachet of Bob Redford and was incredibly well-written.&quot; In getting the idea of the character of Goodwin, Morrow read four of his books.

Levinson was originally attached to the project as director, but because of his commitment to the film &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), the job went to Redford. However, Levinson was then cast by Redford for the part of Dave Garroway, as Redford liked his &quot;easygoing, casual manner&quot; and interest in 1950s culture. For the scene involving J. Fred Muggs, a chimpanzee &quot;unnerved by the lights and cameras&quot; was found, as no animals trained for film production were available. Martin Scorsese was cast by Redford for his physical features as well as for &quot;his own personal style and delivery, so I found it interesting to have him play a tough character gently. And given his delivery style, in which he talks real fast, I thought it would make the character extremely menacing.&quot;

== Themes ==
&quot;Quiz Show&quot; has been categorized as a Faustian tale about the loss of innocence (both for its three main characters and the entire country), temptation with money, moral ambiguity, positive guises hiding negative actions, the cult of celebrity, the negative side effects of fame, the power and corruption of big business and mass media, the consequences of overcompetitiveness in business, racial, ethnic and class conflict and the discord between education and entertainment. Attanasio, Redford and many film critics considered &quot;Quiz Show&quot;″s subject matter essential, as it marked the beginning of the country&#x27;s loss of innocence and faith in its trusted institutions that was exacerbated by events such as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.

Reviews from &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; noted that in the era of the film&#x27;s release, scandals and culturally unacceptable behaviors were more expected and less shocking to the American public than they had been in the 1950s. &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote: &quot;Neck high in &#x27;90s cynicism, it&#x27;s hard to believe the tremors these scandals provoked. [...] In the &#x27;50s, Ingrid Bergman was blacklisted from Hollywood for having a baby out of wedlock. Today, Oliver North makes hash of the Constitution and it jump-starts his political career. What used to ruin your life gets you invited on &#x27;Oprah&#x27; and a fat book deal. Shame is for losers; public confession and a 12-step program can turn you into a role model.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Quiz Show&quot; was released in September 1994. although some reports from late 1993 indicated that the film was planned to be distributed in the first half of 1994.

With &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, Disney launched a platform-release strategy geared to generate interest in and publicity for the film by releasing it in a limited number of theaters before opening wider. &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, released around the same time, was distributed in a similar manner, but as with &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, it was a box-office failure.

&quot;Quiz Show&quot; opened in New York on September 14, 1994 and expanded to 27 screens for the weekend, grossing $757,714, the fifth-highest-grossing opening weekend for a film showing on fewer than 50 screens. It grossed $792,366 in its first five days. The film gradually expanded over the next four weeks to a maximum of 822 screens and grossed a total of $24,822,619 in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., the film&#x27;s box-office performance began to fall even after its four Academy Award nominations, dropping 63% in weekly grosses for the week of March 12, 1995.

Following its theatrical run, &quot;Quiz Show&quot; ran at international festivals, such as the 1995 Berlin International Film Festival and the Chinese edition of the Sundance Film Festival, which ran from October 5 to 12, 1995. Five weeks prior to the Berlin festival, Redford informed Disney that he would not attend because of his work in &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot; (1996) and commitment to the Sundance festival. However, according to festival director Moritz de Hadeln, the festival had agreed to promote &quot;Quiz Show&quot; only if Redford had attended. His failure to attend eroded his relationship with Disney and other film-festival organizers, and it negatively impacted promotion for the film&#x27;s international release.

In countries such as Germany and France, &quot;Quiz Show&quot; generally performed far better in big cities than in smaller towns and attracted more female viewers than male. In Italy, despite much press and interest in the film, it was not a commercial success. The film performed well in Spain, where it grossed $368,000 within six days during a 31-screen run. The film grossed an international total of $1.4 million by February 12, 1995. It finally grossed $27.4 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $52.2 million.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Quiz Show&quot; currently holds a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Directed with sly refinement by Robert Redford and given pizazz by a slew of superb performances, &quot;Quiz Show&quot; intelligently interrogates the erosion of public standards without settling on tidy answers.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three and a half stars out of four, calling the screenplay &quot;smart, subtle and ruthless.&quot; Web critic James Berardinelli praised the &quot;superb performances by Fiennes&quot; and wrote that &quot;John Turturro is exceptional as the uncharismatic Herbie Stempel.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman highlighted the supporting performance of Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s in the relationship between the two Van Dorens that &quot;Quiz Show&quot; finds its soul.&quot; Kenneth Turan called Scofield&#x27;s performance his best since &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966) and suggested that the film &quot;would have been a very different experience&quot; without Fiennes&#x27; &quot;ability to project the pain behind a well-mannered facade, to turn intellectual and emotional agony into a real and living thing&quot;, but also criticized Turturro&#x27;s and Morrow&#x27;s exaggerated performances.

Charles Van Doren said: &quot;I understand that movies need to compress and conflate, but what bothered me most was the epilogue stating that I never taught again. I didn&#x27;t stop teaching, although it was a long time before I taught again in a college. I did enjoy John Turturro&#x27;s version of Stempel. And I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh when Stempel referred to me in the film as &#x27;Charles Van Fucking Moron.&#x27;&quot;
