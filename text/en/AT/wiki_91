<text>Jean-Baptiste Colbert (; 29 August 1619 – 6 September 1683) was a French statesman who served as First Minister of State from 1661 until his death in 1683 under the rule of King Louis XIV. His lasting impact on the organization of the country&#x27;s politics and markets, known as Colbertism, a doctrine often characterized as a variant of mercantilism, earned him the nickname &quot;le Grand Colbert&quot; (; &quot;the Great Colbert&quot;).

A native of Reims, he was appointed Intendant of Finances on 4 May 1661. Colbert took over as Controller-General of Finances, a newly created position, in the aftermath of the arrest of Nicolas Fouquet for embezzlement, an event that led to the abolishment of the office of Superintendent of Finances. He worked to develop the domestic economy by raising tariffs and encouraging major public works projects, as well as to ensure that the French East India Company had access to foreign markets, so that they could always obtain coffee, cotton, dyewoods, fur, pepper, and sugar. He acted to create a favorable balance of trade and increase colonial holdings. As there was slavery in the colonies, in 1682, Colbert commissioned the beginning of a project that would become the &quot;Code Noir&quot; in 1685, two years after his death. In addition, he founded France&#x27;s merchant navy (&quot;marine marchande&quot;), becoming Secretary of State of the Navy in 1669.

His effective market reforms included the foundation of the &quot;Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs&quot; in 1665 to supplant the importation of Venetian glass, which was forbidden in 1672 as soon as the national glass manufacturing industry was on sound footing. Also encouraging the technical expertise of Flemish cloth manufacturing in France, he founded royal tapestry works at Gobelins and supported those at Beauvais. He issued more than 150 edicts to regulate the guilds. The &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; was founded in 1666 at his suggestion; he was a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot; from 1 March 1667 to his death, where he occupied the 24th seat, to which Jean de La Fontaine was later elected. His son Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquis de Seignelay (1651–1690), succeeded him as Navy Secretary.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Colbert&#x27;s father and grandfather were merchants in his birthplace of Reims, France. He claimed to have Scottish ancestry. A widespread (but unconfirmed) belief exists that he spent his early youth at a Jesuit college, working for a Parisian banker; as well as working for the father of Jean Chapelain.

Before the age of 20, Colbert had a post in the war office, a position generally attributed to the marriage of an uncle to the sister of Secretary of War Michel Le Tellier. Colbert spent some time as an inspector of troops, eventually becoming the personal secretary of Le Tellier. 
In 1647, through unknown means, Colbert acquired the confiscated goods of an uncle, Pussort. In 1648, he and his wife Marie Charron, received 40,000 crowns from an unknown source; and in 1649 Colbert became the councilor of state, i.e. a political minister.

In 1657, he purchased the Barony of Seignelay.

===Rise to power===
Colbert was recommended to King Louis XIV by Mazarin. While Cardinal Mazarin was in exile, Louis&#x27;s trust in Colbert grew. In 1652 Colbert was asked to manage the affairs of the Cardinal while he was away. This new responsibility would detach Colbert from his other responsibility as &quot;commissaire des guerres&quot;. Although Colbert was not a supporter of Mazarin in principle, he would defend the cardinal&#x27;s interests with unflagging devotion.

Colbert&#x27;s earliest recorded attempt at tax reform came in the form of a &quot;mémoire&quot; to Mazarin, showing that less than half of the taxes paid by the people reached the King. The paper also contained an attack on Nicolas Fouquet. The postmaster of Paris, a spy of Fouquet&#x27;s, read the letter, leading to a dispute which Mazarin attempted to suppress.

In 1661, Mazarin died and Colbert &quot;made sure of the King&#x27;s favor&quot; by revealing the location of some of Mazarin&#x27;s hidden wealth. In January 1664 Colbert became the Superintendent of buildings; in 1665 he became Controller-General of Finances; in 1669, he became Secretary of State of the Navy; he also gained appointments as minister of commerce, of the colonies, and of the palace. In short, Colbert acquired power in every department except that of war.

A great financial and fiscal reform now claimed all his energies. Not only the nobility, but many others who had no legal claim to exemption, paid no taxes; the bulk of the burden fell on the rural poor. Supported by the young king Louis XIV, Colbert aimed the first blow at the man accused of being the greatest of the royal embezzlers, the superintendent Nicolas Fouquet. Fouquet&#x27;s fall secured Colbert&#x27;s own advancement.

===Economic reform===
After the abolition of the office of superintendent and of many other offices dependent upon it, control of France&#x27;s finances fell to a royal council. The sovereign functioned as its president, but Colbert, though only an &quot;intendant&quot; for the first four years, operated as its ruling spirit, enjoying as he did king&#x27;s favor and confidence.

His ruthlessness in the execution of his functions may have set a dangerous precedent, but it probably struck him necessary in that the council could not defer to individual interests. This way of administering his policies was particularly in evidence in his preparation and enforcement of his forestry ordinance of 1669. When he had severely punished guilty officials, he turned his attention to the government&#x27;s fraudulent creditors. Here he had a simple way of operating. He repudiated some of the public loans and reduced the interest rate on others. The amount of the reduction was initially his own decision but ultimately that of a council he established to examine all claims against the state.

Much more serious difficulties met his attempts to introduce equality in taxation among the various classes. Cutting back the number of the privileged proved impossible, but Colbert firmly resisted false claims for exemption and lightened direct taxation by increasing indirect taxes, from which the privileged could not escape. At the same time, he undertook improvements to the way taxes were collected.

Colbert&#x27;s relentless hard work and thrift made him an esteemed minister. He achieved a reputation for improving the state of French manufacturing and bringing the economy back from the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, despite his best efforts, France grew increasingly impoverished because of the King&#x27;s excessive spending on wars.

===Economic theory===
Having introduced a measure of order and economy into the workings of the government, Colbert called for the enrichment of the country by means of commerce. Through Colbert&#x27;s &quot;dirigiste&quot; policies, France fostered manufacturing enterprises in a wide variety of fields. The authorities established new industries, protected inventors, invited in workmen from foreign countries, and prohibited French workmen from emigrating.

To maintain the character of French goods in foreign markets as well as to afford a guarantee to the domestic consumer, Colbert had the quality and quantity of each article fixed by law, punishing breaches of the regulations by public exposure of the delinquent and destruction of the goods concerned, and, on the third offense, by the pillory. Colbert prohibited the production of certain products that might have suited consumers, and the time-consuming supervision he imposed on commercial enterprises may have acted as a hindrance to improvement. Other parts of Colbert&#x27;s schemes have met with less equivocal condemnation.

By his firm maintenance of the corporation system, each industry remained in the hands of certain privileged &quot;bourgeois&quot;; while the lower classes found opportunities of advancement closed. He did, however, wisely consult the interests of internal commerce.

Unable to abolish the duties on the passage of goods from province to province, he did what he could to induce the provinces to equalize them. Currency exchange rates still remained between these provinces despite a policy focusing on the unification of French trade. His régime improved roads and canals. Pierre Paul Riquet (1604–1680) planned and constructed the Canal du Midi under Colbert&#x27;s patronage.

To encourage overseas trade with the Levant, Senegal, Guinea and other places, Colbert granted privileges to companies, but, like the noted French East India Company, all proved unsuccessful.

===Promoter of culture===

Colbert took much interest in art and literature. He possessed a remarkably fine private library, which he delighted to fill with valuable manuscripts from every part of Europe and the Near East where France had placed a consul. He employed Pierre de Carcavi and Étienne Baluze as librarians. Colbert&#x27;s grandson sold the manuscript collection in 1732 to the Bibliothèque Royale.

Colbert founded a number of institutions: 
* in 1663 the Academy of Inscriptions and Medals 
* in 1666 the Academy of Sciences (now part of the Institut de France) and the French Academy at Rome
* in 1667 the Paris Observatory, which he employed Claude Perrault to build and brought Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1625–1712) from Italy to superintend 
* in 1669 the Académie d&#x27;Opéra, later renamed the Académie Royale de Musique
* in 1671 the Academy of Architecture
* Academies at Arles, Soissons, Nîmes and many other towns

He reorganised the Academy of Painting and Sculpture which Mazarin had established. Wishing to increase the prestige of the image of France and the French royal family, Colbert played an active role in bringing the great Italian architect-sculptor, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, to Paris (June–October 1665), in order to design the new East Facade of the Louvre. This was a striking coup and caused a sensation because Bernini, the most famous artist in all of Europe, had never before (or after) consented to travel any significant distance to meet a patron, however highly ranked, but had to agree in this case for reasons of diplomacy between France and the Holy See. While in France, Bernini also sculpted a marble portrait bust of Louis XIV (Versailles palace). However the relations between the two strong-willed men, Colbert and Bernini, proved melodramatically stormy. Bernini&#x27;s Louvre design was ultimately rejected.

Colbert himself became a member of the Académie française; and proposed one very characteristic rule with the intention of expediting the great &quot;Dictionary&quot;, in which he had a great interest: no one could count as present at any meeting unless he arrived before the hour of commencement and remained till the hour for leaving. In 1673 Colbert presided over the first exhibition of the works of living painters; and he enriched the Louvre with hundreds of pictures and statues.

He gave many pensions to men of letters, among whom we find Molière, Corneille, Racine, Boileau, P D Huet (1630–1721) and Antoine Varillas (1626–1696); and even foreigners, as Huygens, Carlo Roberto Dati the Dellacruscan. Evidence exists to show that by this munificence he hoped to draw out praises of his sovereign and himself; but this motive certainly does not account for all the splendid, if in some cases specious, services that he rendered to literature, science and art.

===Death===
Colbert worked incessantly hard until his final hours. Work was his religion; he once pondered whether it was better to rise early and work or retire very late and work. He concluded that rising early and retiring late would be the ideal combination. Towards the end of his life he suffered from stomach aches, which caused him much distress. He was reduced to eating moist bread dipped in chicken broth for his meals.

By 64 he was bedridden and died seven days after his birthday. The surgeons who examined him found that he had been suffering from kidney stones. A huge stone was found in his urinary tract, which would explain his pain.

==Religion==
Colbert played a subordinate role in the struggle between the king and the papacy over royal rights concerning vacant bishoprics, and he seems to have sympathised with the proposal that suggested seizing part of the wealth of the clergy. In his hatred of idleness, he ventured to suppress no less than seventeen &quot;fêtes&quot;, and he had a project for reducing the number of persons devoted to clerical and monastic life by increasing the age for taking vows.

He showed himself initially unwilling to interfere with heresy, for he realised the commercial value of the Huguenots (French Protestants), who were well represented among the merchant classes. When the king resolved to make all France Roman Catholic and revoked the Edict of Nantes, he followed him and urged his subordinates to do all they could to promote conversions.

==Legacy==
Colbert had nine children, including : 
*Jeanne-Marie Colbert (1650–1732) , married Charles Honoré d&#x27;Albert, duc de Luynes
*Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquis de Seignelay (1651–1690) , followed his father as Secretary of State of the Navy
*Jacques-Nicolas Colbert (1654–1707) , Archbishop of Rouen.
*Jean-Jules-Armand Colbert (1664–1704) , marquis de Blainville, killed at the Battle of Blenheim.
*Henriette-Louise (1657–1733) , married Paul de Beauvilliers, 2nd duc de Saint-Aignan

His policies inspired those of Alexander Hamilton, the first treasury secretary of the United States.

Six ships of the French Navy bore his name:
* A steam corvette in 1848
* A battleship in 1875
* A cargo ship in 1914
* A dundee in 1916
* A French heavy cruiser, launched 1928
* A French missile cruiser, launched 1956

In literature, the power struggle between Colbert and Fouquet is one of the main plotlines of Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s novel &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne&quot;, the second sequel to &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Dumas paints Colbert as an uncouth and ruthless schemer who stops at little, in contrast to the more refined Fouquet, counselled by Aramis, but also as a visionary patriot.

Colbert&#x27;s statue stands outside the Assemblée nationale. It was vandalized in 2020 due to Colbert&#x27;s part in drafting the Code noir. The main building of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance building, completed in 1989, is named after him.

==Quotes==
* &quot;It is simply, and solely, the abundance of money within a state [which] makes the difference in its grandeur and power.&quot;
* &quot;The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest [number] of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing.&quot;

<doc id="146812" wikidata="Q164071" url="?curid=146812" title="South Jutland County">
<text>South Jutland County (Danish: &quot;Sønderjyllands Amt&quot;) is a former county (Danish: &quot;amt&quot;) on the south-central portion of the Jutland Peninsula in southern Denmark.

The county was formed on 1 April 1970, comprising the former counties of Aabenraa (E), Haderslev (N), Sønderborg (SE), and Tønder (SW). The county was abolished effective 1 January 2007, when the Region of Southern Denmark was formed.

Following the reunification of the region with Denmark, the Church of Denmark elevated Haderslev to a diocese in 1923 and divided the region between the dioceses of Ribe (W) and Haderslev (E). This arrangement remains in effect.

==History==

South Jutland county is also known as Northern Schleswig (Danish: &quot;Nordslesvig&quot;, German: &quot;Nordschleswig&quot;). The name refers specifically to the southernmost of the Danish part of the Jutland Peninsula that formerly belonged to the former Duchy of Schleswig (Danish: &quot;Slesvig&quot; or &quot;Sønderjylland&quot;), a Danish fief under the Kings of Denmark.

Denmark lost the Duchy of Schleswig, as well as the German Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, to Prussia and Austria in 1864 in the Second War of Schleswig. Following Austria&#x27;s defeat in the Austro-Prussian War (1866), all three provinces were annexed to Prussia. 

After the October Revolution in Russia, Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils were organized all over Germany following the example of &quot;soviets&quot; in revolutionary Russia. South Jutland was part of Germany until 1920 and such councils were established in several towns. In most places there was very little unrest or revolutionary activities and the councils helped to maintain calm and order.

Following the defeat of Germany in World War I, the Allied powers organised two plebiscites in Northern and Central Schleswig on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. In Northern Schleswig 75% voted for reunification with Denmark and 25% for remaining in Germany. Though there is no historical census, it is estimated that the percentage of ethnic Germans in Northern Schleswig was less than the 25% that had voted for remaining in Germany. From 1920 to 1939, Johannes Schmidt-Vodder was elected as the sole ethnic German representative in the Danish Parliament with consistently 13 to 15% of the North Schleswig votes, providing an indication of the actual percentage of ethnic Germans in the region.

In Central Schleswig the situation was reversed with 80% voting for Germany and 20% for Denmark. No vote ever took place in the southern third of Schleswig, as the result was considered a foregone conclusion. Today, they both form a part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

On 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig was officially reunited with Denmark. It is the only one of the German transfers of territory after World War I that the Nazis did not dispute. A small ethnic German minority still lives in South Jutland county, predominantly in and near the towns of Tønder and Aabenraa (German: &quot;Tondern&quot; and &quot;Apenrade&quot;). A relatively larger Dane minority lives in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

===1970 borders===
As reconstituted in 1970, South Jutland County had slightly different borders to the area gained from Germany in 1920: the towns of Hejle, Taps and Vejstrup (which were Danish throughout the period 1864 to 1920) were included in its jurisdiction, whereas Spandet, Roager and Hviding (German from 1864 to 1920) were included in the neighbouring 1970–2006 county of Ribe.

==Insignia==

The coat of arms of South Jutland County was designed in 1980 and is derived from the historic coat of arms of Schleswig which in turn is derived from the national coat of arms of Denmark. The inspiration for the Dannebrog pennant was a 13th-century seal used by Erik Abelsøn, Duke of Schleswig.

<text>Aabenraa Municipality (, ) is a &quot;kommune&quot; in the Region of Southern Denmark in southwestern Denmark. The municipality has an area of 940.7 km2 and a total population of 58,657 (2024). Its largest town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Aabenraa. The mayor of the municipality is Jan Riber Jakobsen, representing the Conservative People&#x27;s Party.

The island of Barsø is located in the northeast corner of the municipality in the Little Belt. Major communities include Lundsbjerg near the capital, Aabenraa; Sogard to the south, Felsted to the east, and Løjt Kirkeby to the north. Løjt Kirkeby is connected by ferry service from the island of Barsø.

==History==
From 1864 to 1920, the region was part of Prussia, in the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, and as such part of the North German Confederation and, from 1871 onwards, part of the German Empire. It was formerly the seat of, respectively the German Kreis Apenrade and the Danish Aabenraa County.

===Former municipality===
The 1970-2006 Aabenraa municipality was bordered by the municipality of Lundtoft to the south and east, and Rødekro and Tinglev to the west. As it was partially located on a peninsula, it was surrounded by water on three sides: at the southern side of the peninsula by Aabenraa Fjord opening up to the Little Belt east of the peninsula; at the northern side by Genner Bay (&quot;Genner Bugt&quot;). in South Jutland County on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula in south Denmark. The municipality, including the island of &quot;Barsø&quot;, covered an area of 129 km2 with a total population of 22,132 (2005). Its last mayor was Poul Thomsen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.

A new Aabenraa municipality was formed on 1 January 2007 as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007) where the former municipality merged with Bov, Lundtoft, Rødekro, and Tinglev.

== Locations ==
==Politics==
Aabenraa&#x27;s municipal council consists of 31 members, elected every four years. The municipal council has nine political committees.

===Municipal council===
Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==North Schleswig Germans==
Aabenraa Municipality is home to the only officially recognised ethno-linguistic minority of Denmark proper, the North Schleswig Germans. This minority makes up about 6% of the total population of the municipalities of Aabenraa/Apenrade, Haderslev/Hadersleben, Sønderborg/Sonderburg and Tønder/Tondern. In these four municipalities, the German minority enjoys certain linguistic rights in accordance with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

The German-language daily &quot;Der Nordschleswiger&quot; is published in Aabenraa.

<text>Augustenborg () is a town on Als Island in Sønderborg Municipality, Region of Southern Denmark in Denmark. The town lies at the head of Als Fjord. To the east is the Little Belt. Ferry service connects Augustenborg to the island of Funen from the nearby town of Fynshav.

Augustenborg has a population of 3,184 (1 January 2024). It was the main town of Augustenborg Municipality until its merger into Sønderborg Municipality in 2007.

==History==
The town grew up around Augustenborg Palace which was established by Ernest Günther, a member of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein (its branch of Sønderborg) and a cadet of the royal house of Denmark, in the years after 1651. The palace, and the town consequently, received the name in honor of Ernest&#x27;s wife Auguste, herself also from a branch of dukes of Schleswig-Holstein.

The palace became the chief seat of their line which used the name Augustenborg as its branch name. Later, a Danish king made the head of that line specifically Duke of Augustenborg. They grew in relative prominence in late 18th century, and in the 19th century Schleswig-Holstein Question, being the symbols of pro-German nationalistic movement in Schleswig-Holstein. The area was annexed by Prussia in 1864 from Denmark, but was returned in 1920 following a plebiscite.

The Augustenborg male line died out in 1931, upon the death of Albert, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, a grandson of Queen Victoria. Their female-line descendant today holds the throne of Sweden.

<text>Christiansfeld, with a population of 2,979 (1 January 2024), is a town in Kolding Municipality in Southern Jutland in Region of Southern Denmark. The town was founded in 1773 by the Moravian Church and named after the Danish king Christian VII. Since July 2015 it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site, highlighting its status as the best-preserved example of the town-planning and architecture of the Moravian Church.

==Description==
The town was constructed around a central Church Square bordered by two parallel streets running east to west. The Hall, Sister&#x27;s House, fire-house, the vicarage, and the former provost’s house were built directly around the square, and shops, Brother&#x27;s House, family residences, a hotel, and a school were built along the parallel streets. Many of the residential buildings are communal, which were typical of Moravian settlements and were used by the widows and unmarried women and men of the congregation. The architecture of Christiansfeld is homogeneous, dominated by one or two-story buildings made out of yellow brick and red tile roofs. Many of the buildings in Christiansfeld retain their original uses.

==History==
Most of Christiansfeld was constructed in the years 1773–1800, following a strict city plan that drew inspiration from the earlier Moravian settlements of Herrnhaag and Gnadau. To encourage construction, king Christian VII promised a ten-year tax holiday for the city and paid 10% of the construction costs of new houses. By 1779, the town&#x27;s population reached 279, and by 1782, it had about 400 residents. It was one of many towns in Schleswig officially designated a small market town (&quot;flække&quot;).

In 1864, Christiansfeld and the rest of Schleswig was ceded to Prussia as a result of Denmark&#x27;s defeat in the Second Schleswig War. It remained a part of Germany until 1920 when, as a part of a plebiscite called for by the Treaty of Versailles, Northern Schleswig voted to rejoin Denmark. After reunification, the Moravian church lost some of the rights it had obtained as a part of the town&#x27;s founding in the 18th century. For example, it no longer had the ability to choose the towns leadership, paving the way for the town&#x27;s first Danish mayor who was not a member of the church in 1920. The church also sold its schools at this time due to the declining membership of its congregation.

From 1970 to 2007, the town was the administrative seat of Christiansfeld Municipality, but it lost this status and was placed in the Kolding Municipality as a part of the Municipal Reform of 2007 (Kommunalreformen 2007).

In 2009 Kolding Municipality and Realdania-foundation agreed on a 100 million DKK restoration project of the inner-city. In 2012 the A.P. Møller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney Møllers Fond donated 60 million DKK for the restoration of the Sister&#x27;s House.

==Today==
Today, the city is a tourist attraction: the old city core, the Moravian Church with its light, simple and impressive hall and the special cemetery draw thousands of tourists each year. Its well preserved architecture is one of the reasons it was nominated as a tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. It was finally inscribed on the main list on 4 July 2015.

The town is famed for its honey cakes. These are baked to a secret recipe from 1783. Until 2008, the cakes were baked in the original 18th-century bakery, which was then renovated because of new national sanitary standards, but still uses the original recipes.

The former Nordborg Municipality covered an area of 125 km2, and had a total population of 13,956 (2005). Its last mayor was Jan Prokopek Jensen, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party.

The municipality was created in 1970 as the result of a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that merged a number of existing parishes:
* Egen Parish
* Havnbjerg Parish
* Nordborg Parish
* Oksbøl Parish
* Svenstrup Parish

Over the years the presence of Danfoss has made the former Nordborg Municipality, the site of one of the largest industrial workplaces in Denmark. In later years, the municipality saw the rise of another major industrial company, &quot;Linak&quot;, a global producer of electric linear actuator systems.

On 1 January 2007 Nordborg Municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Augustenborg, Broager, Gråsten, Sundeved, Sydals, and Sønderborg municipalities to form the new Sønderborg Municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 499 km2 and a total population of 49,886 (2005).

<text>Rødding () is a town with a population of 2,783 (1 January 2024) in Southern Denmark. It is located in Vejen municipality in Region of Southern Denmark on the Jutland peninsula.

== History ==
The area around Rødding was first inhabited around 3000 years ago, and was dotted with huts and burrows on the outskirts of the Farris Forest. The region was historically impoverished. This is evidenced by the city&#x27;s original church which, due to the lack of resources at the time, is considerably smaller and simpler than many of the neighboring towns&#x27; churches.

In 1844 Rødding Højskole was built in the town. It was the first højskole, and remains the world&#x27;s oldest folk high school.

In 1864, After the Battle of Dybbøl, Rødding came under Prussian control and the town became the seat of the northern region of Schleswig. Prussian rule put many restrictions on commercial trade which spurred agricultural development. The region was reunified with Denmark in 1920 after a popular vote.

Rødding municipality was created in 1970, and the region&#x27;s eight parishes were merged. The town was the seat of the municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;), which covered an area of 273 km2, and had a total population of 10,915 (2005). Its last mayor was Tage Sørensen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. 
On 1 January 2007, Rødding municipality was dissolved as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Brørup, Holsted, and Vejen municipalities to form the new Vejen municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 817 km2 and a total population of 41,350 (2005). The new municipality is part of the Region of Southern Denmark.



== Notable people ==
* Jakob Knudsen (1858 in Rødding – 1917) a Danish author, educator and clergyman

<text>Tønder Municipality (, , ) is a &quot;kommune&quot; in the Region of Southern Denmark on the Jutland peninsula in south Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 1,252 km2, and has a total population of 36,651 (2024). Its mayor is Jørgen Popp Petersen, a member of the regional Schleswig Party.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Tønder. It consists of six old municipalities, the former Tønder municipality (1970-2006) with 12,706 inhabitants in January 2000 on 184.59 square kilometers among them.

==Subdivision==
The municipality was created in 1970 as the result of a (&quot;Municipal Reform&quot;) that merged a number of existing parishes:
* Abild Parish
* Hostrup Parish
* Møgeltønder Parish
* Tønder Parish
* Ubjerg Parish

== Locations ==
==History==
On 1 January 2007, Tønder municipality was enlarged as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007) when the Bredebro, Højer, Løgumkloster, Nørre-Rangstrup (without Bevtoft Parish), and Skærbæk municipalities were merged into the new Tønder municipality. 


==Politics==
Tønder&#x27;s municipal council consists of 31 members, elected every four years. The municipal council has nine political committees.

===Municipal council===
Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==North Schleswig Germans==
Tønder Municipality is home to the only officially recognised ethno-linguistic minority of Denmark proper, the North Schleswig Germans. This minority makes up about 6% of the total population of the municipalities of Aabenraa/Apenrade, Haderslev/Hadersleben, Sønderborg/Sonderburg and Tønder/Tondern. In these four municipalities, the German minority enjoys certain linguistic rights in accordance with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

<doc id="146835" wikidata="Q972242" url="?curid=146835" title="Eurocopter MH-65 Dolphin">
<text>The Eurocopter MH-65 Dolphin is a twin-engined helicopter operated by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) for medevac-capable search and rescue (SAR) and armed Airborne Use of Force missions. It is a variant of the French-built Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin.

==Development==
The SA366 G1 Dauphin version was selected by the United States Coast Guard in 1979 as its new short range recovery (SRR) air-sea rescue helicopter, replacing the Sikorsky HH-52A Sea Guard. In total 99 helicopters, optimised for the USCG&#x27;s search and rescue role tasks and given the designation HH-65A Dolphin, were acquired. Unlike the HH-52, the HH-65A is not able to perform water landings. The HH-65 normally carries a crew of four: Pilot, Copilot, Flight Mechanic and Rescue Swimmer.

The Dolphin was manufactured by Aerospatiale Helicopter Corporation (later Airbus Helicopters) and assembled in Grand Prairie, Texas. Lycoming LTS101-750B-2 turboshaft engines were selected, while Rockwell Collins manufactured the HH-65&#x27;s avionics in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

The HH-65 Dolphin is used for homeland security patrols, cargo, drug interdiction, ice breaking, military readiness, pollution control, and search and rescue missions. The HH-65 is known for its Fenestron tail rotor and its autopilot capabilities, which can complete an unaided approach to the water and bring the aircraft into a stable hover, or automatically fly search patterns, an ability which allows the crew to engage in other tasks.

In order to comply with U.S. regulations relating to local content (based primarily on the value of individual components of the aircraft), engineering changes were required—notably, the SA365&#x27;s original Turbomeca Arriel engines were replaced with the LTS101-750B-2, which at the time were required to be American. Unfortunately, initial teething problems with this engine worsened as the HH-65&#x27;s weight grew, resulting in several in-flight loss-of-power events. The USCG funded a program to improve engine reliability, but the resulting LTS101-850 failed to meet expectations.

In 1994, the USCG therefore held a fast-track competition to select a new engine, and in March 2004 the Guard announced the selection of the Turbomeca Arriel 2C2-CG, already installed on the EC155. This upgrade began in 2004, and has resulted in a safer and more capable aircraft. These modified HH-65As and HH-65Bs, which also gained new avionics and other enhancements, have been designated as HH-65Cs.

==Design==

The HH-65A&#x27;s minimum equipment requirements exceeded anything previously packaged into a helicopter weighing less than 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg). Seventy-five percent of the HH-65&#x27;s structure—including rotorhead, rotor blades and fuselage—consists of corrosion-resistant composite materials.

Also a unique feature of the Dolphin is its computerized flight management system, which integrates state-of-the-art communications and navigation equipment. This system provides automatic flight control. At the pilot&#x27;s direction, the system will bring the aircraft to a stable hover above a selected object. This is an important safety feature in darkness or inclement weather. Selected search patterns can be flown automatically, freeing the pilot and copilot to concentrate on sighting &amp; searching the object.

A distinctive feature of the MH-65 is its fenestron ducted-fan anti-torque device. The fenestron consists of 11 blades spinning inside a circular housing at the base of the helicopter&#x27;s tail fin.

Certified for single-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR) operation, the HH-65A was the first helicopter certified with a four-axis autopilot, allowing for hands-off hover over a pre-determined location.

==Operational history==
The Dolphin is primarily a Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft. There are now a total of 102 Dolphins in the United States Coast Guard Fleet. The fleet has home ports in 17 cities on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and the Great Lakes region.

The Dolphin is usually deployed from shore but it can be deployed from medium and high endurance Coast Guard Cutters, as well as the Polar Icebreakers. The Dolphin&#x27;s main jobs are: search and rescue, enforcement of laws and treaties (including drug interdiction), polar ice breaking, marine environmental protection including pollution control, and military readiness.

When deployed from an icebreaker, the helicopter acts as the ship&#x27;s eyes, searching out thinner and more navigable ice channels. They also have the job of airlifting supplies to villages isolated by winter, or transporting scientists to conduct remote research.

The MH-65 is also used to patrol the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) around Washington, D.C., also known as the National Capital Region (NCR). Seven new-build MH-65Cs were acquired for this mission.

=== Israeli Air Force service ===
In the early 1980s, the Israeli Navy sought to acquire a purpose-built maritime helicopter to bolster its over-the-horizon detection and targeting capabilities. Several helicopter types were evaluated, including the Westland Lynx and SH-60 Seahawk; in 1983, Israel announced the selection of the HH-65 Dolphin. Seeking a few examples to gain service experience and with limited funding, Israel acquired two used HH-65A developmental test aircraft from the USCG, the first HH-65A pre-production prototype (c/n 6002) and the third prototype (c/n 6005). These were delivered on 4 August 1985 and although owned by the navy, they were operated by the Israeli Air Force. Initially serving as the maritime flight of 124 Squadron at Palmachim, in June 1987 the IAF formed a dedicated maritime squadron, 193 Squadron, to which the two Dolphins were assigned. On 16 September 1996 one crashed in the Mediterranean, killing the three crew members on board. The remaining helicopter was retired a year later, replaced by the Eurocopter AS565 Panther. The Dolphins were operated by a crew consisting of an IAF Pilot, and IAF mechanic and an IN maritime support officer. First deployed in USCG colors, they were later given a blue and gray color scheme.

==Variants==
;HH-65A: Initial USCG version, powered by two LTS101-750B-2 turboshaft engines and with an MTOW.

;HH-65B: Avionics upgrade undertaken on a portion of the fleet. Retrofit included an NVG-compatible integrated flight management avionics suite consisting of two GPS-embedded CDU-900G control display units and two MFD-255 multifunction flat panel displays. The HH-65B upgrade was undertaken at the Coast Guard&#x27;s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) in Elizabeth City, NC, with the first aircraft rolling-off the post-depot maintenance (PDM) line in March 2001.

;HH-65C: HH-65A/B upgraded with new Arriel 2C2-CG engines that provide 40% more power and higher performance, plus an upgraded tail gearbox, long-nose avionics compartment, increased MTOW, expanded lateral flight envelope and Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD) with First Limit Indicator (FLI). First retrofit completed in October 2004.

;MH-65C: Initially intended only for use by the Multi-Mission Cutter Helicopter (MCH), a further enhancement of the HH-65C within the USCG&#x27;s Deepwater effort, includes the installation of a 10-blade low-noise Fenestron, relocated avionics, and an Airborne Use of Force (AUF) package (in common with that of the modernized HH-60T) which provides the capability to fire warning and disabling shots from the air. The MH-65C is used in AUF missions, such as the Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON) mission taken up by the MH-65C in early 2008. AUF aircraft are armed with the Barrett M107CQ 12.7 mm anti-materiel rifle and M240G 7.62 mm machine gun. The helicopter can also be used for counter terrorism.

;MH-65D: MH-65C with an upgraded flight navigation system common to Department of Defense helicopters. The first production MH-65D was completed on 20 January 2011 and is fitted with a Honeywell HG7502 radar altimeter, two Honeywell H-764G EGI&#x27;s (embedded GPS/inertial navigation systems) and two control display units CDU-7000D from Rockwell Collins. 97 HH/MH-65Cs will be upgraded to MH-65D standard.

;MH-65E: The MH-65E incorporates upgrades that will modernize the cockpit by installing digital &quot;glass&quot; cockpit instruments, known as the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) from Collins Aerospace, similar to those installed in the Coast Guard&#x27;s upgraded MH-60T Jayhawk Medium Range Recovery (MRR) helicopters. The Echo upgrade replaces the legacy analog automatic flight control with a digital system, and a digital weather radar system. The MH-65E model is expected to begin deliveries to the fleet in 2017.

<text>Until 1 January 2007 Bov municipality (; ) was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in South Jutland County on the Jutland peninsula in south Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 148 km2, and had a total population of 9,992 (2005). Its last mayor was Jens Aage Helmig, a member of the (Liberal Party) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Padborg.

The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that combined Bov and Holbøl Parish.

Bov municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with former Lundtoft, Rødekro, Tinglev, and Aabenraa municipalities to form the new Aabenraa municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 951 km2 and a total population of 60,151 (2005). The new municipality belongs to the new Region of Southern Denmark.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gram (Old Norse Gramr, meaning &quot;Wrath&quot;), also known as Balmung or Nothung, is the sword that Sigurd used to kill the dragon Fafnir. It is primarily used by the Völsungs in the &quot;Volsunga Saga&quot;. However, it is also seen in other legends, such as the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot; in 
which it is wielded by Hildebrand. 

Depending on the story and source material, Gram may have other names. In &quot;The Nibelungenlied&quot; it is named Balmung. In Richard Wagner&#x27;s work, &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;), it is referred to as Nothung (, &quot;child of need.&quot;)

==Description==
Nowhere in the &quot;Volsunga Saga&quot; is a clear description of Gram given, but there is enough scattered throughout the story to draw a picture of the sword. Sigurd&#x27;s weapons, Gram included, are described as being &quot;all decked with gold and gleaming bright&quot;. Depending on how the text is read, the sword may or may not have a dragon emblazoned on it and/or depending on the translation have been &quot;brown of hue&quot;.

==History==
Gram is primarily seen in the &quot;Volsunga Saga&quot; used by men in the Völsung line after Sigmund. Sigmund receives it during the wedding feast for his sister, Signy. Part of the way through the feast a strange man appears carrying a sword. Although unknown to Sigmund, this is the god Odin. He thrusts the sword into the Barnstokkr tree that grew in the middle of the hall and said, “The man to pull out this sword from the trunk shall receive it from me as a gift and he will find out for himself that he never bore in hand a better sword than this.” Soon after he departed every man made his attempt to pull the sword out of the wood. All fail except Sigmund, who easily extracts it. The sword is a fine sword, and King Siggeir is covetous of it, offering Sigmund three times its weight in gold. When he refuses, King Siggeir grows angry and secretly begins plotting to steal it from Sigmund, eventually killing his father and capturing him and all of his brothers. After this, the sword disappears from the narrative until Signy secretly gives it back to Sigmund as he is buried alive with Sinfjotli. After Sigmund avenges his family, he uses the sword in several battles before it is eventually broken by Odin during Sigmund&#x27;s final battle with King Lyngvi. 

Hjördis, Sigmund&#x27;s wife, takes up the two halves of the blade and keeps them for Sigurd, their son. The dwarven smith Regin later trains an adult Sigurd in metalworking. After a period of time, he tells Sigurd of the mighty dragon, Fafnir, and the treasure which it guards, asking Sigurd to slay it for him. Sigurd agrees on one condition: that Regin makes him a mighty sword capable of slaying such a monster.

Regin confidently makes Sigurd an admirable sword, but when Sigurd sees it, he is disappointed when it easily breaks with a single blow. On his second attempt, Regin makes him a sword superior to the last, but it also breaks. On his third attempt, Sigurd brings Regin the two halves of Gram, his father&#x27;s sword, and when he strikes the anvil, it is cloven in two. Once he tested the strength of the sword, he left the workshop and went to a nearby stream to check its edge. Throwing a piece of wool upstream, he lets it press against Gram, causing it to be sliced through. After testing the blade&#x27;s sharpness, he uses it to avenge his father, Sigmund, by slaying Lyngvi. Of the many feats done by Gram, by far the most well-known and important is the slaying of Fafnir the dragon. This deed is accomplished by Sigurd with a single, mighty thrust to the left shoulder where he drives the sword so deep, he gets his arms bloodied up to the shoulder. Eventually, Gram is used as a sign of chastity when it is placed between Sigurd and Brynhild on their funeral pyre after Brynhild arranged Sigurd&#x27;s death before killing herself in turn. After this, the sword is no longer found in the manuscript.

==In &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;==
In &quot;Siegfried&quot;, the third of the four operas in the &quot;Ring des Nibelungen&quot; cycle, Mime, who essentially takes Regin&#x27;s part, is unable to reforge Nothung (as Gram is called in the &quot;Ring&quot;). Siegfried, however, manages. Apart from this, the story of Regin and Sigurd is more or less identical to that of Mime and Siegfried.

<text>The gram (originally gramme; SI unit symbol g) is a unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) equal to one thousandth of a kilogram.

Originally defined in 1795 as &quot;the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of a metre [1 cm3], and at the temperature of melting ice&quot;, the defining temperature (≈0 °C) was later changed to 4 °C, the temperature of maximum density of water.

By the late 19th century, there was an effort to make the base unit the kilogram and the gram a derived unit. In 1960, the new International System of Units defined a &quot;gram&quot; as one one-thousandth of a kilogram (i.e., one gram is ). The kilogram, as of 2019, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures from the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant ().

== Official SI symbol ==
The only unit symbol for gram that is recognised by the International System of Units (SI) is &quot;g&quot; following the numeric value with a space, as in &quot;640 g&quot; to stand for &quot;640 grams&quot; in the English language. The SI disallows use of abbreviations such as &quot;gr&quot; (which is the symbol for grains), &quot;gm&quot; (&quot;g⋅m&quot; is the SI symbol for gram-metre) or &quot;Gm&quot; (the SI symbol for gigametre).

== History ==
The word &quot;gramme&quot; was adopted by the French National Convention in its 1795 decree revising the metric system as replacing the &quot;gravet&quot; (introduced in 1793 simultaneously with a base measure called &quot;grave&quot;, of which &quot;gravet&quot; was a subdivision). Its definition remained that of the weight of a cubic centimetre of water.

French &quot;gramme&quot; was taken from the Late Latin term &quot;&quot;. This word—ultimately from Greek (&quot;grámma&quot;), &quot;letter&quot;—had adopted a specialised meaning in Late Antiquity of &quot;one twenty-fourth part of an ounce&quot; (two oboli), corresponding to about 1.14 modern grams. This use of the term is found in the &quot;carmen de ponderibus et mensuris&quot; (&quot;poem about weights and measures&quot;) composed around 400 AD.
There is also evidence that the Greek was used in the same sense at around the same time, in the 4th century, and survived in this sense into Medieval Greek, while the Latin term died out in Medieval Latin and was recovered in Renaissance scholarship.

The gram was the base unit of mass in the 19th-century centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). The CGS system coexisted with the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS), first proposed in 1901, during much of the 20th century, but the gram was displaced by the kilogram as the base unit for mass when the MKS system was chosen for the SI base units in 1960.

== Uses ==

The gram is the most widely used unit of measurement for non-liquid ingredients in cooking and grocery shopping worldwide. Liquid ingredients are often measured by volume rather than mass.

Many standards and legal requirements for nutrition labels on food products require relative contents to be stated per 100 g of the product, such that the resulting figure can also be read as a percentage.

== Conversion factors ==

* 1 gram (g) ≈ (gr)
* 1 grain (gr) ≈ 
* 1 avoirdupois ounce (oz) ≈ 
* 1 troy ounce (ozt) = 31.1034768 g (exact, by definition)
* 100 grams (g) ≈ (oz)
* 1 carat (ct) = 0.2 grams
* 1 gamma (γ) = 10−6 grams
* 1 undecimogramme = 1 &quot;eleventh-gram&quot; = 10−11 grams in the historical quadrant–eleventh-gram–second system (QES system) a.k.a. hebdometre–undecimogramme–second system (HUS system) 
* 500 grams (g) = 1 jin in the Chinese units of measurement.

== Comparisons ==
* 1 gram is roughly equal to the mass of 1 small paper clip or pen cap.
* The Japanese 1 yen coin has a mass of 1 gram, lighter than the British penny (3.56 g), the United States penny (2.5 g), the Euro cent (2.30 g), and the Australian 5 cent coin (2.80 g).

<text>Until 1 January 2007 Gram municipality was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in South Jutland County on the Jutland peninsula in south Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 131 km2, and had a total population of 4,860 (2005). Its last mayor was Hans Peter Geil, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The site of its municipal council was in the town of Gram.

Gram municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with existing Haderslev and Vojens municipalities, as well as Bjerning, Hjerndrup, Fjelstrup og Bevtoft parishes of Christiansfeld municipality to form the new Haderslev municipality in Region of Southern Denmark.

<doc id="146842" wikidata="Q313817" url="?curid=146842" title="George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham">
<text>George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham ( ; 20 August 1592 – 23 August 1628), was an English courtier, statesman, and patron of the arts. He was a favourite and self-described &quot;lover&quot; of King James VI and I. Buckingham remained at the height of royal favour for the first three years of the reign of James&#x27;s son, Charles I, until he was assassinated.

Villiers was born in Brooksby, Leicestershire from a family of minor gentry. His ascent began notably in 1614 when, aged 21, he caught the attention of the King. His achievements include being knighted and climbing the ranks of nobility, eventually becoming the Duke of Buckingham. Villiers was the last in a succession of handsome young favourites on whom the King lavished affection and patronage. The pair were often accused of sodomy and most historians today believe the relationship was sexual in nature.

Villiers&#x27; influence extended beyond the King&#x27;s favour; he played a significant role in political and military affairs, including the negotiation of royal marriages and leading military expeditions. His tenure as Lord High Admiral and de facto foreign minister was marked by a series of failed military campaigns, such as the ill-fated Cádiz expedition (1625), which damaged his reputation and public image. Buckingham&#x27;s assassination in 1628 by John Felton, a disgruntled army officer, highlighted the extent of his unpopularity among the public.

== Early life ==

Villiers was born in Brooksby, Leicestershire, on 20 August 1592, the second son of the minor gentleman Sir George Villiers (1550–1606) from his second wife. His mother, Mary (1570–1632), daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire, was widowed early. She educated her son for a courtier&#x27;s life and sent him to travel in France with John Eliot.

Villiers took to the training set by his mother: he could dance and fence well, spoke a little French, and overall became an excellent student. Godfrey Goodman (Bishop of Gloucester from 1624 to 1655) declared Villiers &quot;the handsomest-bodied man in all of England; his limbs so well compacted, and his conversation so pleasing, and of so sweet a disposition&quot;.

== Ascent at court ==

In August 1614, at age twenty-one, Villiers caught the eye of King James I at a hunt in Apethorpe. Opponents of the King&#x27;s favourite Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, saw an opportunity to displace Somerset and began promoting Villiers. Money was raised to purchase Villiers a new wardrobe, and intense lobbying secured his appointment as Royal Cup-bearer, a position that allowed him to make conversation with the King. Villiers began to appear as a dancer in masques from 1615, in which he could exhibit his grace of movement and beauty of body, a recognised avenue to royal favour since the time of Elizabeth I.

Under the King&#x27;s patronage, Villiers advanced rapidly through the ranks of the nobility, and his court appointments grew in importance. In April 1615 he was knighted as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. In 1616, when he became the King&#x27;s Master of the Horse, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Whaddon, Viscount Villiers, and made a Knight of the Garter. The next year he was made Earl and in 1618 promoted Marquess of Buckingham, then finally in 1623 Duke of Buckingham. Villiers&#x27; new rank allowed him to dance side by side with the royal heir Charles I, with whom his friendship developed through his tutoring of the Prince in dance.

Villiers was appointed Lord High Admiral of England in 1619, and in 1623 the former dukedom of Buckingham was recreated for him when he was negotiating abroad on the King&#x27;s behalf. Since the dukedom of Norfolk had lapsed in 1572 with the attainder and execution of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, Buckingham now became the only English duke who, at the time, was not a member of the royal family (James&#x27;s two sons were Duke of Cornwall and Duke of York).

== Relationship with James VI &amp; I ==
Villiers was the last in a succession of handsome young favourites on whom the King lavished affection and patronage. The extent to which the relationship between the two was sexual has been much discussed. James&#x27;s nickname for Buckingham was &quot;Steenie&quot;, after St. Stephen, who was said to have had &quot;the face of an angel&quot;. Speaking to the Privy Council in 1617, James tried to clarify the situation:
 Historian David M. Bergeron claims &quot;Buckingham became James&#x27;s last and greatest lover&quot; citing flowery letters that followed 17th-century styles of masculinity. Other scholars say there was no sexual relationship between the two, though at least one such assessment has been criticised as based on &quot;highly speculative and possibly ahistorical assumptions about same-sex desire in the Renaissance.&quot; 
In a letter to Buckingham in 1623, the King ended with the salutation, &quot;God bless you, my sweet child and wife, and grant that ye may ever be a comfort to your dear father and husband&quot;. Buckingham reciprocated the King&#x27;s affections, writing back to James: &quot;I naturally so love your person, and adore all your other parts, which are more than ever one man had&quot;, &quot;I desire only to live in the world for your sake&quot; and &quot;I will live and die a lover of you&quot;. Buckingham himself provides ambiguous evidence, writing to James many years later that he had pondered &quot;whether you loved me now...better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham, where the bed&#x27;s head could not be found between the master and his dog&quot;.

Speculation about the close relationship between King and favourite was not confined to Great Britain. It was carried back to France by the poet Théophile de Viau, who was resident in England in 1621 and had then addressed to Buckingham the flattering ode &quot;Au marquis du Boukinquan&quot;. On his return, he went on to justify his own masculine preferences by a witty appeal both to Classical mythology and to the contemporary gossip:
::Apollo with his songs 
::Debauched young Hyacinth 
::And that learned English king, 
::Wasn&#x27;t Buckingham his fuck?

== Influence under James VI &amp; I ==
Until King James died in 1625, Buckingham was the King&#x27;s constant companion and closest advisor, enjoying control of all royal patronage. Buckingham used his influence to prodigiously enrich his relatives and advance their social positions, which soured public opinion towards him.

In his rise to power, Buckingham became connected with the philosopher and jurist Francis Bacon. Bacon wrote letters of advice to the young favourite and drafted the patent of nobility when Buckingham ascended to the peerage. With Buckingham&#x27;s support, Bacon was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1618. In gratitude, Bacon honoured Buckingham&#x27;s many requests for favours from the court for friends and allies. Following an investigation by Parliament into royal grants of monopoly, financial speculation and corrupt officials, Bacon was convicted of corruption and forced into retirement. Neither Buckingham nor the King attempted to intervene on Bacon&#x27;s behalf. Many of Buckingham&#x27;s contemporaries believed he had sacrificed Bacon to save himself from Parliamentary scrutiny, as he had been liberally spending public funds and accepting gifts and bribes.

From 1616, Buckingham also established a dominant influence in Irish affairs, beginning with the appointment of his client, Sir Oliver St John, as Lord Deputy, 1616–22. Thence, he acquired control of the Irish customs farm (1618), dominated Irish patronage at court, particularly with the sale of Irish titles and honours, and (from 1618) began to build substantial Irish estates for himself, his family and clients—with the aid of a plantation lobby, composed of official clients in Dublin. To the same end, he secured the creation of an Irish Court of Wards in 1622. Buckingham&#x27;s influence thus crucially sustained an aggressive Irish plantation policy into the 1620s.

When Parliament began its investigation into monopolies and other abuses in England, and later Ireland in 1621, Buckingham made a show of support to avoid action being taken against him. However, the King&#x27;s decision to send a commission of inquiry to Ireland, which included parliamentary firebrands, threatened to expose Buckingham&#x27;s growing, often clandestine, interests there. Knowing that the King had assured the Spanish ambassador that the Parliament would not be allowed to imperil a Spanish matrimonial alliance, he therefore surreptitiously instigated a conflict between the Parliament and the King over the Spanish match, which resulted in the Parliament&#x27;s premature dissolution in December 1621 and a hobbling of the Irish commission in 1622. Irish reforms introduced in 1623–24 by Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, the Lord Treasurer, were largely nullified by Middlesex&#x27;s impeachment and disgrace in the violently anti-Spanish 1624 parliament—spurred on by Buckingham and Prince Charles.

== Charles I, the Lord Admiral and foreign affairs ==

In 1623 Buckingham, now Lord Admiral and effective Foreign Minister, accompanied Charles I, then Prince of Wales, to Spain for marriage negotiations regarding the Infanta Maria. The negotiations had long been stuck, but it is believed that Buckingham&#x27;s crassness was key to the total collapse of the agreement, and they returned in a black mood. The Spanish ambassador asked Parliament to have Buckingham executed for his behaviour in Madrid, but Buckingham gained popularity by calling for war with Spain on his return.

Buckingham headed further marriage negotiations, but when, in December 1624, the betrothal to Henrietta Maria of France was announced, the choice of a Catholic was widely condemned. He visited France in May 1625 to assist in the negotiations, during which he was allegedly &quot;embroiled in a plot to seduce the Queen of France&quot;, Anne of Austria, according to historian Desmond Seward. At Amiens, &quot;where the court took official leave of the English embassy, Buckingham climbed into a private garden where the queen was taking an evening walk&quot;, and &quot;may even have tried to rape her&quot;, although &quot;Anne&#x27;s shrieks summoned her attendants.&quot; King Louis XIII &quot;was so affronted that henceforward he refused to think seriously of an English alliance.&quot;

Buckingham, whose popularity had suffered a further setback as a result of these events, took a decision to help the rebellious Huguenot Admiral Benjamin, Duke of Soubise. An ardent Protestant, Buckingham ordered Sir John Penington to help; but the Royal Navy only succeeded in attacking Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s enemies, defeating his objects in August 1625 and losing La Rochelle. Similarly he was blamed for the failure of the military expedition under the command of Ernst von Mansfeld, a famous German mercenary general, sent to the continent to recover the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1625, which had belonged to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, son-in-law of King James I of England. However, when the Duke of York became King Charles I, Buckingham was the only man from the court of James to maintain his position.

In 1625, Buckingham proposed to send an expedition to Spain in an attempt to reenact what he viewed as the glorious actions of Sir Francis Drake by once again seizing the main Spanish port at Cádiz and burning the Spanish fleet in its harbour. Buckingham&#x27;s past failures had provoked the House of Commons to refuse further levies of taxation to fund his extravagant adventures, but at the same time Parliament was intrigued by the prospect of dealing a blow to the international Catholic conspiracy, and the expedition was authorized. Yet even before the troops set sail the food prepared for the expedition was consumed awaiting the Board of Ordnance to deliver the required cannonry and musket balls. On this occasion, Buckingham himself was not in command. As experienced admirals were unavailable, Buckingham assigned command of the expedition to Sir Edward Cecil, a battle-hardened soldier who had won renown fighting on behalf of the Dutch against the Spanish. This choice of commander proved foolhardy, as while Cecil was a good soldier on land he had no knowledge of the sea.

Although Buckingham&#x27;s plan was tactically sound, calling for landing further up the coast and marching the militia army on the city, the troops were badly equipped, ill-disciplined, and poorly trained. Coming upon a warehouse filled with wine, they simply got drunk, and the attack had to be called off. The English army briefly occupied a small port further down the coast before re-boarding its ships. After the embarrassing fiasco at Cádiz, Cecil decided to try to intercept a Spanish silver fleet on its way back to Spain from America. However, the Spanish were forewarned by their intelligence and easily avoided the planned ambush. With supplies running out and men sick and dying from starvation and disease, the English limped home in disgrace. Public opinion blamed Buckingham for yet another disaster, leading to serious political consequences. The Parliament of 1626 began the process of impeachment against Buckingham, causing King Charles to dissolve Parliament rather than risk a successful impeachment of his favourite.
Buckingham then negotiated with the French Chief Minister, Cardinal Richelieu, for English ships to aid Richelieu in his fight against the French Protestant Huguenots, in return for French aid against the Spanish occupying the Palatinate. Seven English warships participated in operations against La Rochelle and in the siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré, but Parliament was disgusted and horrified at the thought of English Protestants fighting French Protestants. The plan only fuelled their fears of crypto-Catholicism at court. In the end, seven English ships were delivered to the French after much debate and were employed in the conflict, although they were essentially manned by French crews, as most of the English crews had refused to serve against their coreligionists and had disembarked in Dieppe. Following the successful recovery of Ré island by the French forces, the Treaty of Paris (1626) was signed between the city of La Rochelle and King Louis XIII on 5 February 1626, preserving religious freedom but imposing some guaranties against possible future rebellions. Moreover, the French made peace with the Spanish in April 1626, destroying any remaining hope of an Anglo-French alliance against the Habsburgs and obviating any further need to make a show of siding with the French crown against the Huguenots.

In 1627, Buckingham led another expeditionary force to relieve La Rochelle, once again attempting to aid the Huguenots rather than oppose them. To the remnants of the disastrous Cádiz expedition of 1625 were added newly pressed men, which allowed Buckingham to cobble together a force of around 6,000 men. As Parliament was still refusing to appropriate funds for further adventures as long as Buckingham was in charge, and Buckingham himself was nearly bankrupt, he funded the force with help from Sir William Russell, the two men raising approximately £70,000 between them to pay for the men, food, and supplies out of their own pockets. Raising the money took time, and the troops looted the King&#x27;s stores after going unpaid for 10 months. Finally arriving in France in the summer of 1627, Buckingham besieged the fortress of Saint Martin on the isle of Ré, which was now controlled by royalist forces, but soon found himself trapped between the besieged forces and relief forces sent by Cardinal Richelieu. Realizing he risked annihilation, Buckingham abandoned the siege and fought his way back to his ships, but at a heavy cost: altogether, Buckingham lost more than 5,000 men in the brief campaign.

In April 1628, another English fleet was sent to relieve the Huguenots, this time under the command of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh, but Denbigh proved hesitant to fight the large, well-armed French fleet, and returned to Portsmouth without engaging the enemy. Thereafter, Buckingham tried to organise a third expedition, once again under his direct command, and was engaged in this enterprise when he was felled in Portsmouth by an assassin.

==Self-promotion through the arts==
As a means of manoeuvring for political as well as court advancement, Villiers commissioned masques in which he was able to promote himself in a leading role. By appearing there as a dancer himself his grace of movement and beauty of body was put on show. By 1618 his elevation in rank allowed him to dance side by side with the royal heir, with whom his friendship developed through his tutoring of the prince in dance. &quot;Command over his body had provided him with the privilege of commanding the moves of a future king&quot;. This culminated in connivance by his supporters in licensing Thomas Middleton&#x27;s notorious play &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; (1624) as an extension of their anti-Spanish foreign policy. The duke and Prince Charles are acknowledged as figuring there as The White Duke and The White Knight, while very obvious depictions of the Spanish monarch and his former ambassador in England eventually brought about the play&#x27;s closure.
Villiers also commissioned portraits of himself as &quot;a medium for the cultivation of his personal image&quot;. William Larkin&#x27;s portrait of 1616 records the start of his climb, showing him in the dress of a Knight of the Garter and emphasising the felicity of his stance and sumptuousness of dress. A 1619 portrait by Daniel Mytens the Elder is equally elegant. There he is dressed in white brocade and white silk hose, wearing the Garter and standing in a decor of costly silks. Another full-length portrait by the same artist celebrates his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1619. Here he wears three-quarter armour; on the right, behind a balustrade, is a shoreline with the fleet beyond. Buckingham&#x27;s growing wealth was emphasised by the detail of his clothes. This is evident in the lovingly depicted lace about his collar and cuffs in the full-length portrait by Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen. and the head and shoulders by Anthony van Dyck. The 1625 painting by Michiel van Miereveld is not only of unparalleled magnificence, with a jacket encrusted with pearls which also hang in ropes across it, but may also contain a reference to his diplomatic coup that year in negotiating the marriage of the future Charles I. At his entry to the French Court, he is recorded as wearing a grey velvet suit from which the loosely threaded pearls dropped to the ground as he advanced to make his bow to the queen, to the general wonder.
A series of more theatrical depictions heighten Buckingham&#x27;s self-dramatisation and in certain cases make policy statements as well. Two of these are connected with his betrothal to and marriage with Lady Katherine Manners in 1620. In Anthony van Dyck&#x27;s historical painting &quot;The Continence of Scipio&quot;, Buckingham is clearly recognisable standing at the centre, receiving from Scipio the hand of his captured betrothed. A mythical composition commissioned from van Dyck later commemorates the actual marriage. In contrast to the former painting, this was highly unconventional at the time. The couple are pictured all but naked as Venus and Adonis, emphasising heterosexual love and so countering all the rumours of the Duke&#x27;s relations with the King. There is a further literary connection since the story is found in Ovid, but the picture again defies convention by hinting at a different, happier ending.

Buckingham probably met Peter Paul Rubens while conducting the royal marriage negotiations in Paris in 1625 and commissioned two ambitious advertisements of his standing from the painter. The first of these was destined for the ceiling of his York House residence and depicts a masque-like theme in which &quot;Minerva and Mercury conduct the Duke of Buckingham to the Temple of Virtue&quot; (also known as &quot;The Apotheosis of the Duke of Buckingham&quot; and &quot;The Duke of Buckingham Triumphing over Envy and Anger&quot;). In front of the marble temple to which he is carried upwards are the probable figures of Virtue and Abundance; the three Graces offer the Duke a crown of flowers, while Envy seeks to pull him down and a lion challenges him. The picture is an allegory of Buckingham&#x27;s political aspirations and the forces that he saw as impeding him. Though the painting was destroyed in a fire in 1949, it was survived by a preparatory oil sketch now held in the National Gallery in London and by a copy of that sketch made by William Etty. Yet another Rubens portrait was rediscovered in 2017, when the painter&#x27;s preparatory portrait of Buckingham was identified at Pollok House in Scotland.

Rubens&#x27; other major commission, &quot;Equestrian Portrait of the Duke of Buckingham&quot; (1625) is accounted &quot;the finest state portrait of its date in England&quot;. The original was destroyed in a fire at the Le Gallais depository in St Helier, Jersey, on 30 September 1949, but a sketch by Rubens is now in the Kimbell Art Museum. A summation of his career to date, it depicts Buckingham as Lord High Admiral of the fleet that is just visible in the background. Several other personal references are also incorporated. As Master of the King&#x27;s Horses, he sits on a Spanish jennet (a breed he introduced to Britain), lifting a baton as his horse rears on command. Beneath him, the sea god Neptune and a naiad adorned with pearls indicate the duke&#x27;s dominion over the sea. Overhead, a winged allegory of Fame signals victory (which nevertheless evaded the commander in real life) with trumpet in hand. Privately Rubens noted Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;arrogance and caprice&quot; and predicted that he was &quot;heading for the precipice&quot;.
Popular prints, often drawing on his painted portraits, particularly Miervelt&#x27;s of 1625, had served to advertise Buckingham&#x27;s position more broadly over the years. These now form part of the collection at the National Portrait Gallery. At the same time martial statements were being made through this medium in support of Buckingham&#x27;s foreign policy, as for instance in Willem de Passe&#x27;s equestrian portrait of the Duke, executed at the same time as Rubens was engaged on his monumental work on the same theme. There he is similarly depicted as Lord Admiral with a military baton in his right hand. During the 1627 expedition that he led personally, Buckingham was recorded as sponsoring &quot;an unprecedented campaign of intensive print propaganda&quot;.

In 1628, during the political turmoil that culminated in his assassination, Buckingham commissioned another masque-like painting from Gerard van Honthorst, &quot;The Liberal Arts presented to King Charles and Henrietta Maria&quot;. In this the Duke is cast as Mercury, the patron of the arts, the procession of whom is brought in his train to the presence of the King and Queen in the guise of Apollo and Diana. In this validation of his artistic credentials, it is appropriate to remember that Buckingham had taken part in the masque &quot;Mercury Vindicated&quot; at the start of his career in 1615.

== Assassination ==

During the course of the Duke&#x27;s incompetent leadership, Parliament twice attempted to impeach him. The King rescued him both times by dissolving Parliament, but public feeling was so inflamed as a result that the Duke was widely blamed as a public enemy. Eventually his physician, Dr. Lambe, popularly supposed to assert a diabolic influence over him, was mobbed in the streets and died as a result. Among the pamphlets issued afterwards was one that prophesied
The Duke was stabbed to death on 23 August 1628 at the Greyhound Inn in Portsmouth, where he had gone to organise yet another campaign to aid La Rochelle. According to the eyewitness account sent by Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester to the Queen, &quot;he turned about, uttering only this word, &quot;villaine!&quot; and never spoke more: but presently, plucking out the knife from himself, before he fell to the ground, he made towards the traitor two or three paces, and then fell against a table.&quot; The assassin was John Felton, an army officer who had been wounded in the earlier military adventure and believed he had been passed over for promotion by Buckingham.

Such was the Duke&#x27;s unpopularity by this time that Felton was widely acclaimed as a hero by the public. A large number of poems celebrating Felton and justifying his action were published. Copies of written statements Felton carried in his hat during the assassination were also widely circulated. Many of these described Buckingham as effeminate, cowardly and corrupt, and contrasted him with Felton, who was held up as an example of manliness, courage and virtue. The son of Alexander Gill the Elder was sentenced to a fine of £2000 and the removal of his ears, after being overheard drinking to the health of Felton, and stating that Buckingham had joined King James in hell. However, these punishments were remitted after his father and Archbishop William Laud appealed to King Charles I. Felton was hanged on 29 November and his body was taken to Portsmouth for public display. However, this proved to be a miscalculation by the authorities as it became an object of veneration by the public.

==Tomb==
Buckingham was buried in a side-chapel of the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey. His lavish tomb bears a Latin inscription that may be translated as &quot;The Enigma of the World&quot;. Here, too, he was depicted surrounded by mythical figures. The black marble sculptures at each corner include Mars and Neptune, in reference to his military and naval exploits; on the catafalque lie bronze-gilt effigies of the Duke and his wife (who long survived him), cast by Hubert Le Sueur. Buckingham is clad in armour, enriched with crossed anchors and with an ermine cloak over it. He wears on his breast the chain and Great George pendant of the Garter and on his head a ducal coronet, summing up the principal steps in his brief career. He had died at the age of 35.

== Marriage and children ==
Buckingham married Lady Katherine Manners, the daughter of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, later &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness de Ros, on 16 May 1620, against her father&#x27;s objections. The children of this marriage were:
# Mary Villiers (before 30 March 1622 – November 1685), married firstly Charles Herbert, Lord Herbert; secondly James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond and thirdly Colonel Thomas Howard.
# Charles Villiers, Earl of Coventry (17 November 1625 – 16 March 1627), died in infancy.
# George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (30 January 1628 – 16 April 1687).
# Lord Francis Villiers (bef. 21 April 1629 – 7 July 1648), died in a skirmish at Kingston during the Second English Civil War.

== Legacy ==

During the Duke&#x27;s short tenure as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, he had initiated the purchase of Thomas van Erpe&#x27;s collection of oriental books and manuscripts on its behalf, although his widow only transferred it to Cambridge University Library after his death. With it came the first book in Chinese to be added to the library&#x27;s collections.

After Buckingham&#x27;s assassination, a large amount of satirical verse was circulated on the subject. Most of this reflected on how pride goes before a fall and the damage he had done to the kingdom, while several pieces commended John Felton&#x27;s action.

The Duke&#x27;s residence of York House occupied what eventually became the Adelphi district in London. When his son sold the area to developers, it was on condition that his father and titles were commemorated in naming the new streets. These were, accordingly, George Court, Villiers Street, Duke Street, Of Alley and Buckingham Street.
There are 18th and 19th century accounts of a dagger on display at Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire, that was claimed to be the one used to assassinate Buckingham. Newnham Paddox was the family seat of the Earls of Denbigh and Buckingham&#x27;s sister, Susan, had married William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh. How the dagger (if authentic) came to be at Newnham Paddox was explained by it being recovered after the assassination and sent to Buckingham&#x27;s widow, who was also living there.

==Fictional appearances==
A fictionalised Buckingham is one of the characters in Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s celebrated 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, which paints him as in love with Anne of Austria, as well as dealing with the siege of La Rochelle and his assassination by Felton. He is described:
In the 1973 two-film, Anglo-American adaptation of the book&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;Simon Ward plays Buckingham, in a prominent role as an ally of the main characters. The second film includes his assassination by Felton, but (following the original novel in this) depicts the killing as being orchestrated by the fictional Milady de Winter, an agent of the principal villain, Cardinal Richelieu.

Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s &quot;The Arm and the Darkness&quot; (1943) also deals with this period in France, while Hilda Lewis&#x27; &quot;Wife to Great Buckingham&quot; (1959) goes so far as to make Buckingham&#x27;s love for the French queen the main cause of his undoing. The Duke also figures in historical romances like Evelyn Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Charles, The King&quot; (1963) and Bertrice Small&#x27;s &quot;Darling Jasmine&quot; (2007), although the main focus there is on other protagonists. The Spanish match and Buckingham&#x27;s part in it is made an episode in Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s novel &quot;El Capitán Alatriste&quot; (1996). There he and the then Prince of Wales are the subjects of an assassination attempt by Spanish plotters.

In Philippa Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Earthly Joys&quot; (1998), which has as its subject the famous gardener John Tradescant the Elder, the Duke appears halfway through the novel as the object of Tradescant&#x27;s love. Another historical fiction, Ronald Blythe&#x27;s &quot;The Assassin&quot; (2004), is written from his killer&#x27;s point of view as a final confession while awaiting execution in the Tower of London.

2023–24 saw Buckingham featured in various filmed dramas. He was played by Nicholas Galitzine in the TV miniseries &quot;Mary &amp; George&quot; in Britain, and by 
Jacob Fortune-Lloyd in the paired French films &quot;The Three Musketeers: D&#x27;Artagnan&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers: Milady&quot;.

<text>Philip III (; 14 April 1578 – 31 March 1621) was King of Spain. As Philip II, he was also King of Portugal, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia and Duke of Milan from 1598 until his death in 1621.

A member of the House of Habsburg, Philip III was born in Madrid to King Philip II of Spain and his fourth wife, his niece Anna, the daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria of Spain. Philip III later married his cousin Margaret of Austria, sister of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor.

Although also known in Spain as Philip the Pious, Philip&#x27;s political reputation abroad has been largely negative. Historians C. V. Wedgwood, R. Stradling and J. H. Elliott have described him, respectively, as an &quot;undistinguished and insignificant man,&quot; a &quot;miserable monarch,&quot; and a &quot;pallid, anonymous creature, whose only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice.&quot; In particular, Philip&#x27;s reliance on his corrupt chief minister, Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma, drew much criticism at the time and afterwards. For many, the decline of Spain can be dated to the economic difficulties that set in during the early years of his reign. Nonetheless, as the ruler of the Spanish Empire at its height and as the king who achieved a temporary peace with the Dutch (1609–1621) and brought Spain into the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) through an (initially) extremely successful campaign, Philip&#x27;s reign remains a critical period in Spanish history.

==Early life==
After Philip III&#x27;s older half-brother Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias died insane, their father Philip II had concluded that one of the causes of Carlos&#x27; condition had been the influence of the warring factions at the Spanish court. He believed that Carlos&#x27; education and upbringing had been badly affected by this, resulting in his lunacy and disobedience, and accordingly he set out to pay much greater attention to arrangements for his later sons. Philip II appointed Juan de Zúñiga, then Prince Diego&#x27;s governor, to continue this role for Philip, and chose García de Loaysa as his tutor. They were joined by Cristóvão de Moura, 1st Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo, a close supporter of Philip II. In combination, Philip believed they would provide a consistent, stable upbringing for Prince Philip, and ensure that he would avoid the same fate as Carlos. Philip&#x27;s education was to follow the model for royal princes laid down by Father Juan de Mariana, focusing on the imposition of restraints and encouragement to form the personality of the individual at an early age, aiming to deliver a king who was neither tyrannical nor excessively under the influence of his courtiers.

Prince Philip appears to have been generally liked by his contemporaries: &quot;dynamic, good-natured and earnest&quot; suitably pious, having a &quot;lively body and a peaceful disposition&quot; albeit with a relatively weak constitution. The comparison with the memory of the disobedient and ultimately insane Carlos was usually a positive one, although some commented that Prince Philip appeared less intelligent and politically competent than his late brother. Indeed, although Philip was educated in Latin, French, Portuguese and astronomy, and appears to have been a competent linguist, recent historians suspect that much of his tutors&#x27; focus on Philip&#x27;s undeniably pleasant, pious and respectful disposition was to avoid reporting that, languages aside, he was not in fact particularly intelligent or academically gifted. Nonetheless, Philip does not appear to have been naive—his correspondence to his daughters shows a distinctive cautious streak in his advice on dealing with court intrigue.

Philip first met the Marquis of Denia—the future Duke of Lerma—then a gentleman of the King&#x27;s chamber, in his early teens. Lerma and Philip became close friends, but Lerma was considered unsuitable by the King and Philip&#x27;s tutors. Lerma was dispatched to Valencia as viceroy in 1595, with the aim of removing Philip from his influence; but after Lerma pleaded poor health, he was allowed to return two years later. By now in poor health himself, King Philip II was becoming increasingly concerned over the prince&#x27;s future, and he attempted to establish de Moura as a future, trusted advisor to his son, appointing his ally, García Loaysa y Girón as archbishop of Toledo. The Prince received a new, conservative Dominican confessor. The following year, Philip II died after a painful illness, and his son became King Philip III.

==Religion, Philip and the role of women at court==
Philip married his cousin, Margaret of Austria, on 18 April 1599, a year after becoming king. Margaret, the sister of the future Emperor Ferdinand II, would be one of three women at Philip&#x27;s court who would apply considerable influence over the King. Margaret was considered by contemporaries to be extremely pious—in some cases, excessively pious, and too influenced by the Church—&#x27;astute and very skillful&#x27; in her political dealings, although &#x27;melancholic&#x27; and unhappy over the influence of the Duke of Lerma over her husband at court. Margaret continued to fight an ongoing battle with Lerma for influence up until her death in 1611. Philip had an &#x27;affectionate, close relationship&#x27; with Margaret, and paid her additional attention after they had a son in 1605.

Margaret, alongside Philip&#x27;s grandmother and aunt, Empress Maria—the Austrian representative to the Spanish court—and Margaret of the Cross, Maria&#x27;s daughter—formed a powerful, uncompromising Catholic and pro-Austrian voice within Philip&#x27;s life. They were successful, for example, in convincing Philip to provide financial support to Ferdinand from 1600 onwards. Philip steadily acquired other religious advisors. Father Juan de Santa Maria—confessor to Philip&#x27;s daughter, doña Maria, was felt by contemporaries to have an excessive influence over Philip at the end of his life, and both he and Luis de Aliaga Martínez, Philip&#x27;s own confessor, were credited with influencing the overthrow of Lerma in 1618. Similarly Mariana de San Jose, a favoured nun of Queen Margaret&#x27;s, was also criticised for her later influence over the King&#x27;s actions.

==Style of government==
The Spanish crown at the time ruled through a system of royal councils. The most significant of these were the Council of State and its subordinate Council for War, that were in turn supported by the seven professional councils for the different regions, and four specialised councils for the Inquisition, the Military Orders, Finance and the Crusade tax. These councils were then supplemented by small committees, or &quot;juntas&quot;, as necessary, such as the &#x27;junta of the night&#x27; through which Philip II exercised personal authority towards the end of his reign. As a matter of policy, Philip had tried to avoid appointing grandees to major positions of power within his government and relied heavily on the lesser nobles, the so-called &#x27;service&#x27; nobility. Philip II had taken the traditional system of councils and applied a high degree of personal scrutiny to them, especially in matters of paperwork, which he declined to delegate—the result was a &#x27;ponderous&#x27; process. To his contemporaries, the degree of personal oversight he exercised was excessive; his &#x27;self-imposed role as the chief clerk to the Spanish empire&#x27; was not thought entirely appropriate. Philip first started to become engaged in practical government at the age of 15, when he joined Philip II&#x27;s private committee. In his &quot;Republica Mista&quot;, Tomás Fernández de Medrano advised Philip III of Spain that withdrawing from his subjects might be regarded as &#x27;a form of religion&#x27;, drawing a comparison between the king&#x27;s limited interaction with his people and the reverence shown to the consecrated Eucharist. Philip III elevated his father&#x27;s principles of inaccessibility and invisibility to unprecedented levels. He drastically limited daily access to himself, granting it almost exclusively to his royal favorite, the Duke of Lerma, who managed most audiences to maintain the king&#x27;s unseen presence.

Philip III&#x27;s approach to government appears to have stemmed from three main drivers. Firstly, he was heavily influenced by the eirenic ideas being circulated in Italian circles in reaction to the new Humanist theories of governance, typified by Machiavelli. Writers such as Girolamo Frachetta, who became a particular favourite of Philip, had propagated a conservative definition of &#x27;reason of state&#x27; which centred on exercising a princely prudence and a strict obedience to the laws and customs of the country that one ruled. Secondly, Philip may have shared Lerma&#x27;s view that the governmental system of Philip II was fast proving impractical and unnecessarily excluded the great nobles of the kingdoms—it had been creaking badly in the last decades of his father&#x27;s life. Lastly, Philip&#x27;s own personality and his friendship with Lerma heavily shaped his approach to policy-making. The result was a radical shift in the role of the crown in government from the model of Philip II.

===Duke of Lerma as &quot;valido&quot;===
Within a few hours of Philip ascending to the throne, Lerma had been made a royal counsellor by the new king and set about establishing himself as a fully fledged &quot;valido&quot;, or royal favourite. Lerma, in due course declared a duke, positioned himself as the gateway to the King. All the business of government, Philip instructed, was to arrive in writing and be channeled through Lerma before reaching him. While Philip was not hugely active in government in other ways, once these memoranda, or &quot;consulta&quot;, had reached him he appears to have been assiduous in commenting on them. Debates in royal councils would now only begin upon the written instruction of the king—again, through Lerma. All members of royal councils were under orders to maintain complete transparency with Lerma as the King&#x27;s personal representative; indeed, in 1612 the councils were ordered by Philip to obey Lerma as if he were the king. The degree to which Lerma himself played an active role in government has been disputed. Contemporaries were inclined to see Lerma&#x27;s hand in every action of government; others have since thought Lerma to have &#x27;neither the temperament nor the energy&#x27; to impose himself greatly on the actions of government; still others consider Lerma to have carefully attended only those Councils of State that addressed matters of great importance to the King, creating a space for the wider professionalisation of government that had been lacking under Philip II.

This new system of government became increasingly unpopular very quickly. The novel idea of a &quot;valido&quot; exercising power went against the long-standing popular conception that the king should exercise his powers personally, not through another. Before long, the apparatus of the Spanish government was packed with Lerma&#x27;s relatives, Lerma&#x27;s servants and Lerma&#x27;s political friends, to the exclusion of others. Lerma responded by further limiting his public visibility in politics, avoiding signing and writing documents personally, and constantly stressing that he was, humbly, only working on behalf of his master, Philip III.

===Imperial proconsuls===
Lerma&#x27;s role as royal favourite at court was further complicated by the rise of various &#x27;proconsuls&#x27; under Philip III&#x27;s reign—significant Spanish representatives overseas, who came to exercise independent judgement and even independent policies in the absence of strong leadership from the centre. The challenges to government communication during the period encouraged aspects of this, but the phenomenon was much more marked under Philip III than under either the reign of his father or son.

In the Netherlands, his father Philip II had bequeathed his remaining territories in the Low Countries to his daughter Isabella of Spain and her husband, Archduke Albert, under the condition that if she died without heirs, the province would return to the Spanish Crown. Given that Isabella was notoriously childless, it was clear that this was only intended to be a temporary measure, and that Philip II had envisaged an early revision to Philip III. As a result, Philip&#x27;s foreign policy in the Netherlands would be exercised through the strong-willed archdukes, but in the knowledge that ultimately the Spanish Netherlands would return to him as king. Meanwhile, the Italian-born Ambrosio Spinola was to perform a crucial role as a Spanish general in the Army of Flanders. Having demonstrated his military prowess at the siege of Ostend in 1603, Spinola rapidly started to propose and implement policies almost independently of the central councils in Madrid, somehow managing to achieve military victories even without central funding from Spain. Lerma was uncertain of how to deal with Spinola; on the one hand, Lerma desperately needed a successful military commander in the Netherlands—on the other, Lerma was contemptuous of Spinola&#x27;s relatively low origins and scared of his potential to destabilise Lerma at court. In the years leading to the outbreak of war in 1618, Spinola was working to produce a plan to finally defeat the Dutch Republic, involving an intervention in the Rhineland followed by fresh hostilities aiming to cut the Low Countries in two: portrayed at the time as the &#x27;spider in the web&#x27; of Catholic politics in the region, Spinola was operating without significant consultation with Philip in Madrid.

In Italy, a parallel situation emerged. Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes, as governor of the Duchy of Milan, exploited the lack of guidance from Madrid to pursue his own highly interventionist policy across north Italy, including making independent offers to support the Papacy by invading the Venetian Republic in 1607. Fuentes remained in power and pursuing his own policies until his death. Pedro de Toledo Osorio, 5th Marquess of Villafranca, as governor of Milan, similarly exercised his own considerable judgement on foreign policy. Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna, who had married into the Sandoval family as a close ally of Lerma, again showed significant independence as the Viceroy of Naples towards the end of Philip&#x27;s reign. In conjunction with the Spanish ambassador to Venice, the influential Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar, Osuna pursued a policy of raising an extensive army, intercepting Venetian shipping and imposing sufficiently high taxes that threats of a revolt began to emerge. To exacerbate matters, Osuna was found to have prevented the local Neapolitans from petitioning Philip III to complain. Osuna fell from power only when Lerma had lost his royal favour, and Osuna&#x27;s negative impact on Philip&#x27;s plans for intervention in Germany had become intolerable.

===Fall of Lerma===
From 1612 onwards, and certainly by 1617, the Lerma administration was crumbling. The monopoly of power in the hands of the Lerma&#x27;s Sandoval family had generated numerous enemies; Lerma&#x27;s personal enrichment in office had become a scandal; Lerma&#x27;s extravagant spending and personal debts were beginning to alarm his own son, Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda; lastly, ten years of quiet diplomacy by Fathers Luis de Aliaga, Philip&#x27;s confessor, and Juan de Santa Maria, Philip&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s confessor and a former client of Queen Margaret, had begun to apply personal and religious pressure on the King to alter his method of government. Philip remained close to Lerma, however, and supported him in becoming a cardinal in March 1618 under Pope Paul V, a position which would offer Lerma some protection as his government collapsed.

Lerma fell to an alliance of interests—Uceda, his son, led the attack, aiming to protect his future interests, allied with Baltasar de Zúñiga, a well-connected noble with a background in diplomacy across Europe, whose nephew, Olivares was close to the heir to the throne, Prince Philip. Lerma departed for his ducal seat, and for six weeks Philip did nothing; then, in October, Philip signed a decree removing the powers of his former &quot;valido&quot;, and announcing that he would rule in person. Uceda initially took over as the primary voice at court, but without his father&#x27;s extensive powers, while de Zúñiga became Philip&#x27;s minister for foreign and military affairs. Philip, while unwilling to move further against Lerma, took politically symbolic action against Lerma&#x27;s former secretary Rodrigo Calderón, a figure emblematic of the former administration. Calderón, suspected of having killed Philip&#x27;s wife Queen Margaret by witchcraft in 1611, was ultimately tortured and then executed by Philip for the more plausible murder of the soldier Francisco de Juaras.

==Domestic policy==
Philip inherited an empire considerably enlarged by his father. On the Iberian Peninsula, Philip II added Portugal to his domains in 1580; across Europe, despite the ongoing Dutch revolt, Spanish possessions in Italy and along the Spanish Road appeared secure; globally, the combination of Castilian and Portuguese colonial territories gave a Spanish ruler unparalleled reach from the Americas to the Philippines and beyond through India to Africa.

The challenge for such a ruler was that these territories were, in legal reality, separate bodies, different entities bound together in personal union through the royal institutions of the Spanish crown, utilising Castilian nobility as a ruling class. Even within the peninsula itself, Philip would rule through the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal, the autonomous provinces of Catalonia and Andalusia—all only loosely joined through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip III. Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces.

===Expulsion of the Moriscos===

One of Philip&#x27;s first domestic changes was the issuing of a decree in 1609 for the expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain, timed to coincide with the declaration of a truce in the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The Moriscos were the descendants of those Muslims that had converted to Christianity during the Reconquista of the previous centuries; despite their conversion, they retained a distinctive culture, including many Islamic practices. Philip II had made the elimination of the Morisco threat a key part of his domestic strategy in the south, attempting an assimilation campaign in the 1560s, which had resulted in the revolt that concluded in 1570. In the final years of his rule, Philip&#x27;s father had reinvigorated efforts to convert and assimilate the Moriscos, but with almost 200,000 in the south of Spain alone, it was clear by the early years of the new century that this policy was failing.

The idea of completely cleansing Spain of the Moriscos was proposed by Juan de Ribera, the Archbishop and Viceroy of Valencia, whose views were influential with Philip III. Philip&#x27;s eventual decree to expel a nationality that had lived in Spain for over 800 years and was assimilated within it was based less on doctrinal than financial considerations—confiscating the &#x27;wealth&#x27; of the Moriscos – which caused jealousy and resentment by other Christians in Spain, especially in Valencia. Financially, the royal treasury stood to gain by seizing the assets of the removed peoples, while in due course those close to the crown would benefit from cheap land or gifts of estates. Estimates vary slightly, but between around 275,000 to over 300,000 Moriscos were forced out of Spain between 1609 and 1614. To accomplish this, the &quot;armada&quot;, or navy, and 30,000 soldiers were mobilized with the mission of transporting the families to Tunis or Morocco. Philip intervened in the problematic decision of what to do with Morisco children—should they be allowed to take them to Islamic countries, where they would be brought up as Muslims—and if they were to remain in Spain, what should be done with them? Philip paternalistically decreed that Morisco children under the age of seven could not be taken to Islamic countries, but that any children remaining in Valencia should be free from the threat of enslavement, and rejected some of Ribera&#x27;s more extreme suggestions.

While popular at the time, and in keeping with earlier policies, this measure significantly damaged the economies of the Kingdom of Valencia, Aragon and Murcia. The supply of cheap labour and the number of rent paying property owners in these areas decreased considerably, as did agricultural outputs. The cultivation of sugarcane and rice had to be substituted for white mulberry, vineyards and wheat.

===Economic decline and failed reform===
Philip III&#x27;s reign was marked by significant economic problems across Spain. Famine struck during the 1590s through a sequence of bad harvests, while from 1599 to 1600 and for several years afterwards there was a terrible outbreak of bubonic plague across Spain, killing over 10% of the population. Mateo Alemán, one of the first modern novelists in Europe, captured the despondent mood of the period, describing &#x27;the plague that came down from Castile and the famine that rose from Andalusia&#x27; to grip the country. While the failing harvests affected the rural areas most, the plagues reduced the urban population most significantly, in turn reducing the demand for manufactured goods and undermining the economy further. The result was an economically weakened Spain with a rapidly falling population.

Financially, Philip&#x27;s situation did not appear much better. He had inherited huge debts from his father, Philip II, and an unhelpful tradition that the Crown of Castile bore the brunt of royal taxation—Castile carried 65% of total imperial costs by 1616. Philip III received no money from the &quot;cortes&quot;, or parliaments, of Aragon, the Basque provinces or Portugal; Valencia only provided one contribution, in 1604. Philip did not openly challenge this situation, but instead depended more and more heavily on the Castilian &quot;cortes&quot;; in turn, the &quot;cortes&quot; increasingly began to tie new grants of money to specific projects, subtly but steadily altering the relationship between the King and &quot;cortes&quot;. By the financial crisis of 1607, the &quot;cortes&quot; had even insisted that it be recalled every three years, and that Philip take an oath—on pain of excommunication—to promise that he had spent the royal funds in line with the promises made previously to the &quot;cortes&quot;.

Philip and Lerma&#x27;s attempts to resolve this crisis largely failed, and were not helped by the increasing size of the royal household—an attempt to increase royal prestige and political authority—Philip&#x27;s own household costs rose enormously at a time of falling income. Philip&#x27;s attempts to issue new currency—in particular the issues of the copper &quot;véllon&quot; coinage in 1603–04, 1617 and 1621—simply created considerable instability. The costs of the Dutch campaign resulted in Philip&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1607, and the crown&#x27;s attempt to resolve this by converting the &quot;asiento&quot; tax system—high-interest loans owed to tax farmers—into longer-term &quot;juros&quot; bonds paying a much lower interest, produced a short-term benefit, but at the price of losing financial flexibility during future crises. By 1618, almost all Philip&#x27;s crown income was already assigned to its various creditors and he had almost no spending discretion left. Financially, the Spanish state had become dominated by Genoese bankers and lenders under Philip II, whose lines of credit had allowed the Spanish state to continue during its moments of financial crisis; under Philip III this process remained unchecked, building up considerable resentment against this foreign influence, some going so far as to term the bankers &#x27;white moors&#x27;.

Throughout Philip&#x27;s reign, a body of analysis of Spain&#x27;s condition began to emerge through the work of the numerous &quot;arbitristas&quot;, or commentators, that dominated public discussions from around 1600 through to the 1630s. These different voices focused heavily on the political economy of Spain—the rural depopulation, the diverse and bureaucratic administrative methods, the social hierarchies and corruption, offering numerous, if often contradictory, solutions. Nonetheless, through most of Philip&#x27;s reign there was no significant attempt at reform—Philip continued to rule in line with local laws and customs. Philip encouraged consolidation of noble estates, selling off large quantities of crown lands to favoured nobles and creditors. There were no attempts to create an equivalent to the French &quot;intendant&quot; position—the closest equivalent, the &quot;corregidor&quot;, lacked the strong links to the crown required to overcome local opposition. Only in Philip&#x27;s final years did reform begin to gain momentum; a reform committee, or &quot;Junta de Reformación&quot;, was established in Lerma&#x27;s final months in 1618. Under the incoming administration, including the reformist Baltasar de Zúñiga, this committee ground on, but would only deliver substantial, if ill-fated results, when rejuvenated under Philip IV&#x27;s reign.

==Foreign policy==
On his accession, Philip inherited two major conflicts from his father. The first of these, the ongoing and long-running Dutch revolt, represented a serious challenge to Spanish power from the Protestant United Provinces in a crucial part of the Spanish Empire. The second, the Anglo–Spanish War was a newer, and less critical conflict with Protestant England, marked by a Spanish failure to successfully bring its huge military resources to bear on the smaller English military.

Philip&#x27;s own foreign policy can be divided into three phases. For the first nine years of his reign, he pursued a highly aggressive set of policies, aiming to deliver a &#x27;great victory&#x27;. His instructions to Lerma to wage a war of &#x27;blood and iron&#x27; on his rebellious subjects in the Netherlands reflects this. After 1609, when it became evident that Spain was financially exhausted and Philip sought a truce with the Dutch, there followed a period of retrenchment; in the background, tensions continued to grow, however, and by 1618 the policies of Philip&#x27;s &#x27;proconsuls&#x27;—men like Spinola, Fuentes, Villafranca, Osuna and Bedmar—were increasingly at odds with Lerma&#x27;s policy from Madrid. The final period, in which Philip intervened in the Holy Roman Empire to secure the election of Ferdinand II as Holy Roman Emperor and in which preparations were made for renewed conflict with the Dutch, largely occurred after the fall of Lerma and the rise of a new, more aggressive set of advisors in the Madrid court.

===War with the Dutch, England and the truce of 1609–21===
Philip&#x27;s initial aim was to achieve a decisive &#x27;great victory&#x27; in the long-running war against the rebellious Dutch provinces of the Spanish Netherlands, while placing renewed pressure on the English government of Queen Elizabeth I in an effort to terminate English support for their Dutch colleagues. The Spanish &quot;armada&quot;, or navy, rebuilt in the 1590s, remained effective against the English, but after the failure of the Spanish invasion of Ireland at the Battle of Kinsale, Philip reluctantly accepted that further attacks on England were unlikely to succeed. In the Netherlands, a new war strategy resulted in a re-establishment of Spanish power on the north side of the great rivers Meuse and Rhine, stepping up the military pressure on the rebel provinces. The strategy of a &#x27;great victory&#x27;, however, began to descend into a financial war of attrition: the Southern Netherlands—still under Spanish control—and the Dutch Republic in the north—dominated by Calvinist Protestants—were both exhausted, and after the 1607 financial crisis, Spain too was unable to pursue the war. Philip III turned to peace negotiations instead; with the accession to the throne of James I of England it became possible to terminate both the war and English support to the Dutch, with the signature in 1604 of the Treaty of London.

The Twelve Years&#x27; Truce with the Dutch followed in 1609, which enabled the Southern Netherlands to recover, but it was a de facto recognition of the independence of the Dutch Republic, and many European powers established diplomatic relations with the Dutch. The truce did not stop the commercial and colonial expansion of the Dutch into the Caribbean and the East-Indies, although Spain had tried to impose the liquidation of the Dutch East India Company as a treaty condition. Minor concessions of the Dutch Republic were the scrapping of the plan to create a Dutch West India Company and to stop the harassment of the Portuguese in Asia. Both concessions were temporary as the Dutch soon recommenced preying upon Portuguese interests, which had already led to the Dutch–Portuguese War in 1602 and would continue till 1654. At least with peace in Europe, the Twelve Year&#x27;s truce gave Philip&#x27;s regime an opportunity to begin to recover its financial position.

With the death of Henry IV of France—a supporter of the war against Spain—a period of instability commenced in the Kingdom of France. In a sequence of aggressive policy moves, and largely without firm direction from Philip, his regional proconsuls of the Duke of Osuna, viceroy of Naples and the Marquess of Villafranca, the Governor of Milan, directed the Spanish policy in Italy that encountered resistance from the Duchy of Savoy and the Republic of Venice. To secure the connection between Milan and the Netherlands a new route for the Spanish Road was opened through Valtellina, then part of the independent state of the Three Leagues (the present-day canton of Graubünden, Switzerland), and in 1618 the plot of Venice occurred in which the authorities engaged in the persecution of pro-Spanish agents.

=== Iberian approachments to Asia ===

Philip III was an exceptional Spanish king as his global policy priorized issues of East Indies (Indo-Pacific Asia region) over West Indies (Atlantic Americas-Africa region) due to inheriting in his duties the attendance of Portuguese Empire (like Ottoman–Portuguese confrontations) and also the menaces from Dutch East Indies in the Eighty Years&#x27; War, so he wanted to integrate the Indo-Mediterranean routes of exchange, under the leadership of the Iberian Union, through securing the Spanish-Portuguese position on the coasts of Africa and Asia (preventing the arrival and strengthening of Dutch and English forces that threatened the Tordesillas&#x27; monopoly). The main goals were the spread of Catholicism to Eastern civilizations, seizure the economic interests of the Portuguese Empire while strengthening Iberian collaboration in oversea to achieve defensive independence, and militarly isolate hostile great powers against Spanish Empire (such as the Ottoman Empire, Dutch Empire and English empire) through developing alliances with Asiatic Great Powers like Safavid Iran or Mughal India.

To realise those objectives, Philip III tried to sent first militar Armadas to the Portuguese India (from 1605-1608), and then militar Relief to the Philippines (from 1610-1624) to reinforce Iberian military forts in the Far East, while also developing Diplomatic missions with Asia (like 1st Persian embassy to Europe or 2nd Japanese embassy to Europe) and an alternative trade route to Spanish East Indies (conecting directly Seville to Manila), appart of the &quot;Galeon de Manila&quot; (which needed to go through Acapulco and Veracruz as intermediarie), to increase profits of Peninsular Spain, while also manage more efficiently the European distribution from Spain of products from China, India and Indonesia. To finance these projects were pardoned the Sephardic Jewish minority converted to Christianity who still resided in Portugal and were Court Jew (in order to control the Brazil-Angola slave trade), moreover were invited investors from allied Italian states (such as Genoa involvement to defy Venetian preponderance) and were asked the various royal audiences for support (as was the case of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which offered to extend the route for a direct connection between Manila and Callao, and from Callao to Spain or Angola), while improvements to the Asian fortifications were financed through trade trips to Japan. Also was necessary to dismish the power of non-coperative elites, mostly Novohispans (which preferred to develop a triangular trade between Mexico with the Philippines and Japan or Maluku), Portuguese (which didn&#x27;t want Castilian presence on Indian Ocean, so mantaining an strict separation of Portuguese Empire from Spanish Empire) and Jesuits (who feared the expansion of Spanish Patronato real against Papal primacy) to improve economic and political control over the non-European areas, which lead to the creation of Castilian Pepper &quot;Estanco&quot; (1605-1684) and the Conselho da India (1604-1614) respectively. Furthermore, the Crown of Castile began negotiations with the Papal States to allow its missionaries (mostly mendicant orders) to pass from the Philippines to Japan and China, abolishing the monopoly of the Portuguese Jesuits.

However, the appearance of Technological problems, such as the lack of Castilian except Marine Pilots or interested personnel to travel to unknown destinies (and survive the hostility from Anglo-Dutch Piracy), along the resistance from the proper Spanish Philippines&#x27; elite whom preferred the Manila galleon, and of the Portuguese Kingdom&#x27;s who were reluctant to collaborate with their territories, caused the failure of this geopolitical project, which had a resounding end with the enmity against Abbas the Great&#x27;s Persia and Sakoku Japan, and the theatres of war against Protestant Great Powers that were opened by the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

===Entry to the Thirty Years&#x27; War===
In the final years of Philip&#x27;s reign, Spain entered the initial part of the conflict that would become known as the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48). The result was a decisive Spanish victory in the Holy Roman Empire that would lead to a recommencement of the war with the Dutch shortly after Philip&#x27;s death. Europe was anticipating a fresh Imperial election for the position of Holy Roman Emperor upon the likely death of Matthias, who was heirless. Spain and Austria&#x27;s common Habsburg ancestry influenced Spain&#x27;s involvement in the convoluted politics of the Empire: on the one hand, Philip had a vested interest in the success of his cousin Ferdinand of Bohemia, who intended to follow Matthias to the throne; on the other, Philip had hopes of electing one of his own family, such as Prince Philip, to the Imperial throne and worried that a failed bid by Ferdinand might reduce collective Habsburg prestige.

Philip finally chose to intervene behind Ferdinand. Prince Philip had been rejected as unacceptable to the German nobility. Philip had also been increasingly influenced over the years by first Queen Margaret, and later the other, powerful Habsburg women at court, while the incoming set of advisors that replaced Lerma, especially de Zúñiga, also saw Spain&#x27;s future as part of a strong alliance with a Habsburg Holy Roman Empire. Finally, by the Oñate treaty of 29 July 1617, Ferdinand made a successful appeal to Philip&#x27;s self-interest by promising Spain the Habsburg lands in Alsace in return for Spanish support for his election.

Crisis broke out in Ferdinand&#x27;s Kingdom of Bohemia during 1618–19, with a confrontation between Catholic and Protestant factions. Ferdinand asked Spain for help to put down the rebellion; the Protestant rebels turned to Frederick V, Elector Palatine as their new king. The situation in the Empire was in many ways auspicious for Spanish strategy; in the Spanish Netherlands Ambrosio Spinola had been conspiring to find an opportunity to intervene with the Army of Flanders into the Electoral Palatinate. The Palatinate was a vital, Protestant set of territories along the Rhine threatening the Spanish Road, the main route for reinforcements from other Spanish territories to arrive into the rebellious Dutch provinces (through Genoa). France, assumed bound to support Frederick against Ferdinand, was in fact inclined to remain neutral. The Spanish troops headed by Spinola in the Palatinate and by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly in Bohemia achieved a decisive victory against the Czechs in the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. With the Dutch now vulnerable to a strike through the Rhine valley, a renewed war against the Provinces, with the aim of forcing the Dutch to a more suitable permanent peace, appeared inevitable.

Philip died in 1621 shortly before the recommencement of war—his son, Philip IV, retained his chief foreign policy advisor, de Zúñiga, and an initially highly successful campaign against the Dutch began the same year.

==Colonial policy==
===Chile===

In the Americas Philip inherited a difficult situation in Chile, where the Arauco War raged and the local Mapuche succeeded in razing seven Spanish cities (1598–1604). An estimate by Alonso González de Nájera put the toll at 3,000 Spanish settlers killed and 500 Spanish women taken into captivity by Mapuche. In retaliation the proscription against enslaving Indians captured in war was lifted by Philip in 1608. This decree was abused when Spanish settlers in Chiloé Archipelago used it to justify slave raids against groups such as the Chono people of northwestern Patagonia, who had never been under Spanish rule and never rebelled.

Jesuit missionary Luis de Valdivia believed the Mapuche could be voluntarily converted to Christianity only if there was peace. To diminish hostilities Valdivia proposed a Defensive War in a letter to Philip. The King supported the idea, issuing a decree that established the Defensive War as an official policy in 1612. By the time Defensive War was established war between Spanish and Mapuche had been going on for 70 years.

These policies were not without criticism. Maestre de campo and corregidor of Concepción Santiago de Tesillo claimed the Defensive War gave the Mapuche a much needed respite to replenish their forces that should have been denied. The Real Audiencia of Santiago opined in the 1650s that slavery of Mapuches was one of the reasons for constant state of war between the Spanish and the Mapuche.

=== Philippines ===
The main objective of Philip III&#x27;s reign was to strengthen the islands against the appearance of hostile European navies (English and Dutch) in what was previously a Spanish-Portuguese Iberian monopoly over East Indies, specially after a fight between Spaniards and Dutch near Manila on 1600. Also was desired the expansion over the hostile Ternate Sultanate and it&#x27;s vassal kingdoms, while was feared the possible expel of Spaniards from trading with China or losing New Spain if Dutch power increased in the North Pacific Ocean. Therefore, efforts were made to expand the available fleet of galleys to deter any future Dutch attack, as well as to organize an expedition to Ternate in order to prevent further incursions due to Ternatean–Portuguese conflicts. For that mission, Pedro de Acuña made a series of informs about the situation in the Spanish East Indies and the Portuguese Indonesia, along the relations between Dutch East India Company and Sultanate of Ternate, that he sent to the Council of the Indies on 1602 to develop further actions to benefy both the Captaincy General of the Philippines and the Portuguese India, proposing a big expedition with troops from Spain and Mexico that both would travel to the Philippines carrying resources and money to put an end to the Dutch-Ternatean raids. However, the Council of Portugal hesitated to collaborate with the Council of Castile in those plans, wanting to mantain the status quo from Treaty of Zaragoza instead of a possible increase of Spanish influence over former Portuguese influence on the Spice islands (that now were under VOC and Ternate influence). Despite it, the Spaniards succeded in conquer Ternate on 1606, but failed to stablish a total victory over the Dutch, who were protectors of the Ternatean resistance that expelled Spaniards from some islands.

==Visit to the kingdom of Portugal and death==

To improve the relationship, he undertook a trip to Portugal in 1619, applauded by the new minister and valid, the Duke of Uzeda, son of the Duke of Lerma.

He was received with enthusiasm, councils and corporations spent enormous sums on reception. He was suggested to make Lisbon the capital of the Spanish monarchy. Noblemen and jurisconsults complained that they neither received favors nor were employed in courts, embassies or spanish universities. The Duke of Uzeda treated Teodósio II, Duke of Braganza, a potential leader of opposition to Spanish rule, who had come to pay homage, harshly.

After months in Lisbon, Philip left in October, leaving the country dissatisfied, especially after the reappointment of the Marquis of Alenquer as Viceroy. His son, the future Philip III of Portugal, was sworn as the legitimate heir by the Portuguese. In the rest of Portugal&#x27;s domains, the Dutch had tried to take the Moluccas, Malacca and Mozambique, being defeated by André Furtado de Mendonça and Estêvão de Ataíde.

The reform of the kingdom&#x27;s Ordinances was published in Portugal in 1603, which the King addressed at the beginning of his reign. These are the well-known ordinations called Philippine Ordinances, which were preceded by those entitled Afonsine and Manueline.

This King became known in Portugal by the nickname &quot;The Pious&quot;. Upon leaving Portugal in 1619, he fell seriously ill in Covarrubias, and never recovered, dying within a year. For 53 days he was bedridden, covered in sores and abscesses. He died at the age of 42 due to pulmonary thromboembolism due to prolonged immobilization.

It is said that his last words were: “Oh! If at that time I had been in a desert to become a saint! Now I would appear with more confidence at the judgment seat of Jesus Christ!”

==Legacy==

Philip III died in Madrid on 31 March 1621, and was succeeded by his son, Philip IV, who rapidly completed the process of removing the last elements of the Sandoval family regime from court. The story told in the memoirs of the French ambassador François de Bassompierre, that he was killed by the heat of a &quot;brasero&quot; (a pan of hot charcoal), because the proper official to take it away was not at hand, is a humorous exaggeration of the formal etiquette of the court.

Philip has generally left a poor legacy with historians. Three major historians of the period have described an &#x27;undistinguished and insignificant man&#x27;, a &#x27;miserable monarch&#x27;, whose &#x27;only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice&#x27;. More generally, Philip has largely retained the reputation of &#x27;a weak, dim-witted monarch who preferred hunting and traveling to governing&#x27;.

Unlike Philip IV, whose reputation has improved significantly in the light of recent analysis, Philip III&#x27;s reign has been relatively unstudied, possibly because of the negative interpretation given to the role of Philip and Lerma during the period. Traditionally, the decline of Spain has been placed from the 1590s onwards; revisionist historians from the 1960s, however, presented an alternative analysis, arguing that in many ways Philip III&#x27;s Spain of 1621—reinforced with new territories in Alsace, at peace with France, dominant in the Holy Roman Empire, and about to begin a successful campaign against the Dutch—was in a much stronger position than in 1598, despite the poor personal performance of her king during the period. Philip&#x27;s use of Lerma as his &quot;valido&quot; has formed one of the key historical and contemporary criticisms against him; recent work has perhaps begun to present a more nuanced picture of the relationship and the institution that survived for the next forty years in Spanish royal government.

==Family tree==
Like many Habsburgs, Philip III was the product of extensive inbreeding. His father, Philip II, a product of marriage between first cousins, married his niece, Anna of Austria, herself the product of a cousin couple. Philip III in turn married his first cousin once removed, Margaret of Austria. This pattern would continue in the next generation, ultimately culminating in the end of the Spanish Habsburg line in the person of Philip&#x27;s feeble grandson, Charles II.

<text>An ephemeral port is a communications endpoint (port) of a transport layer protocol of the Internet protocol suite that is used for only a short period of time for the duration of a communication session. Such short-lived ports are allocated automatically within a predefined range of port numbers by the IP stack software of a computer operating system. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) typically use an ephemeral port for the client-end of a client–server communication. At the server end of the communication session, ephemeral ports may also be used for continuation of communications with a client that initially connected to one of the services listening with a well-known port. For example, the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) applications can behave in this manner.

The allocation of an ephemeral port is temporary and only valid for the duration of the communication session. After completion of the session, the port is destroyed and the port number becomes available for reuse, but many implementations simply increment the last used port number until the ephemeral port range is exhausted, when the numbers roll over. Ephemeral ports are also called &quot;dynamic ports&quot;, because they are used on a per request basis, and are only known by number once allocated.

==Range==

==Configuration characteristics==
If certain server software is used, that uses non-ephemeral custom port ranges for initiating some further connections, it needs to be ensured by configuration that this custom port range and the ephemeral port range do not overlap.

<doc id="146847" wikidata="Q4897295" url="?curid=146847" title="Β-Carbon nitride">
<text>β-Carbon nitride (&quot;beta&quot;-carbon nitride), β-C3N4, is a superhard material predicted to be harder than diamond.

The material was first proposed in 1985 by Amy Liu and Marvin L. Cohen. Examining the nature of crystalline bonds they theorised that carbon and nitrogen atoms could form a particularly short and strong bond in a stable crystal lattice in a ratio of 1:1.3, and that this material could be harder than diamond.

Nanosized crystals and nanorods of β-carbon nitride can be prepared by mechanochemical processing.

== Production ==

=== Processing ===
β-C3N4 can be synthesized in a mechanochemical reaction. This method involves ball milling of high-purity graphite powders down to an amorphous nanoscale size under an argon atmosphere. Then argon is replaced by an NH3 gas atmosphere, which helps to form nanosized flake-like β-C3N4. During ball milling, fracture and welding of the reactants and graphite powder particles occur repeatedly from ball/powder collisions. Plastic deformation of the graphite powder particles occur due to the shear bands decomposing into sub-grains that are separated by low-angle grain boundaries, further milling decreases the sub-grain size until nanosize sub-grains form. The high pressure and intense motion promotes catalytic dissociation of NH3 molecules into monatomic nitrogen on the fractured surface of the carbon. Nanosized carbon powders act substantially different from its bulk material as a result of particle dimension and surface area, causing the nanosized carbon to easily react with the free nitrogen atoms, forming β-C3N4 powder.

=== Producing nanorods ===
Single crystal β-C3N4 nanorods can be formed after the powder-like or flake-like compound is thermally annealed with an NH3 gas flow. The size of the nanorods is determined by the temperature and time of thermal annealing. These nanorods grow faster in their axis direction than the diameter direction and have hemispherical-like ends. A cross section of the nanorods indicates that their section morphology is prismatic. It was discovered that they contain amorphous phases, however when annealed to 450 °C for three hours under an NH3 atmosphere, the amount of the amorphous phase diminished to almost none. These nanorods are dense and twinned rather than nanotubes. Synthesizing these nanorods through thermal annealing provides an effective, low-cost, high-yield method for the synthesis of single crystal nanorods.

=== Alternate methods of synthesis ===
Rather than forming a powder or nanorod, the carbon nitride compound can alternatively be formed in thin amorphous films by either shock-wave compression technology, pyrolysis of high nitrogen content precursors, diode sputtering, solvothermal preparation, pulsed laser ablation, or ion implantation.

=== Difficulties of processing ===
Although extensive studies on the process and synthesis of the formed carbon nitride have been reported, the nitrogen concentration of the compound tends to be below the ideal composition for C3N4. This is due to the low thermodynamic stability with respect to carbon phases and N2 gas, indicated by a positive value of the enthalpies of formation. The commercial exploitation of nanopowders is very limited by the high synthesis cost along with difficult methods of production that causes a low yield.

== Characteristics ==

=== Morphology===
β-C3N4 has the same crystal structure as β-Si3N4 with a hexagonal network of tetrahedrally (sp3) bonded carbon and trigonal planar nitrogen (sp2). Thermal annealing can be used to change the crystal morphology from flake-like into sphere- or rod-like structures. The nanorods are generally straight and contain no other defects.

=== Properties ===
A hardness equal or above that of diamond (the hardest known material) has been predicted, but not yet demonstrated.

<text>A may take the form of:

*a ,
*an , or
*a .

Although &quot;proverb&quot; and &quot;saying&quot; are practically synonymous, the same cannot be said about &quot;idiomatic phrase&quot; and &quot;four-character idiom&quot;. Not all &quot;kan&#x27;yōku&quot; and &quot;yojijukugo&quot; are proverbial. For instance, the &quot;kan&#x27;yōku&quot; and the &quot;yojijukugo&quot; are &quot;not&quot; proverbs. To be considered a proverb, a word or phrase must express a common truth or wisdom; it cannot be a mere noun.

== Origin ==
Numerous Asian proverbs, including Japanese, appear to be derived from older Chinese proverbs, although it often is impossible to be completely sure about the direction of cultural influences (and hence, the origins of a particular proverb or idiomatic phrase).

Because traditional Japanese culture was tied to agriculture, many Japanese proverbs are derived from agricultural customs and practices. Some are from the board game Go (e.g., ), the tea ceremony (e.g., ), and Buddhism. Many four-character idioms are from Chinese philosophy written in Classical Chinese, in particular &quot;The Analects&quot; by Confucius. ( is Classical Chinese, from the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;.)

== Usage ==
Japanese commonly use proverbs, often citing just the first part of common phrases for brevity. For example, one might say to refer to the proverb . Whereas proverbs in English are typically multi-worded phrases (e.g. &quot;kill two birds with one stone&quot;), Japanese &quot;yojijukugo&quot; borrow from Chinese and compactly convey the concept in one compound word (e.g., ).

<text>Carl Fredrik Hill (31 May 1849 – 22 February 1911) was a Swedish painter and draftsman. He is known for the atmospheric landscapes he painted during the first four years of his career, and for the drawings of fantastical scenes he created after he became mentally ill in his late twenties.

==Biography==
===Early life and training===
Born the son of a mathematics professor, Hill grew up in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden and had to strike out on his own as a landscape painter against his father&#x27;s wishes. After studying at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, he went to France. In the summer of 1874, he travelled to the village of Barbizon south of Paris, which was a thriving artists&#x27; colony. Both the Barbizon School and Camille Corot had a decisive influence on him.

===Career===


Hill wrote: “I have become convinced that art has no other goal than the truth, le vrai. Not the tritely naturalistic, but the true heart.&quot; He sought his subjects at different sites in France; Montigny-sur-Loing, Champagne and Normandy. Influenced by Impressionism, he abandoned the dark coloration of his early paintings in 1876, and began painting in a freer style, sometimes applying impasto with a palette knife. &quot;Ambition drives me to overexert myself and I give myself no peace&quot; he said. Yet, Hill&#x27;s endeavors were not crowned with official success; his works were rejected when he presented them at the Paris Salon. After a severe psychotic attack in January 1878 and subsequent hospitalization, his career as a landscape painter came to an end at the age of 28. He was diagnosed with hallucinations and paranoia. Friends helped him return home to Sweden where he gained sanctuary at his parental home after a short period at St. Lars mental hospital in Lund. At home he was cared for by his mother and a sister for 28 years until his death in 1911. Hill was buried at Östra churchyard in Lund.

===Later period===
During the 28 years before his death, Hill&#x27;s creative work entered a new phase. The Swedish art historian Ragnar Josephson calls it &quot;the second great period of his life as a painter&quot;. His artistry continued unabated; during these years he drew four drawings a day.
The motifs for Hill&#x27;s drawings in this period came from imagination and memory as well as from older art and illustrations. To Hill, drawing was a way to take control of the new world which had now succeeded the old one. On paper he created a world of his own. Drawing became a way to distract the evil forces that he perceived surrounding him constantly. He defended himself, using a pencil as his weapon. &quot;The prince of whispers ... where the world glows in a blood-red struggle&quot; writes Gunnar Ekelöf in a poem to Hill.

Hill never lived to see his recognition as an artist. He produced thousands of drawings in various techniques: crayon, pencil, ink, India ink and watercolour. Some 3,500 drawings are still thought to exist, of which more than 2,600 are part of the collections of the Malmö Art Museum, as are 23 of his oil paintings. The largest collection of all was donated to the Malmö Art Museum by Hill&#x27;s heirs and have been increased with important gifts from private collections.

Hill&#x27;s drawings were discovered and admired mainly by artists. Thanks to the Swedish collector Rolf de Maré (1888–1964), Hill&#x27;s work become known in connection with the French avant-garde of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1949, a hundred years after Hill&#x27;s birth, a travelling exhibition was shown in London, Lucerne, Basel, Geneva and Hamburg. The exhibition was a success, and in 1952 the Institut Tessin in Paris published a book about Hill with an introduction by Jacques Lassaigne. Since then several works about Hill have appeared in Sweden, and Hill exhibitions succeed one another both in Sweden and abroad. Hill is now reckoned as one of Sweden&#x27;s most important landscape painters, and the drawings done during the time he was ill in Lund have made him known outside Sweden as well.

<text>Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or whom they believe to be injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders&#x27; hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a Good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.

Good Samaritan laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as do their interactions with various other legal principles, such as consent, parental rights and the right to refuse treatment. Most such laws do not apply to medical professionals&#x27; or career emergency responders&#x27; on-the-job conduct, but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they are acting in a volunteer capacity.

The principles contained in Good Samaritan laws more typically operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is English common law, such as Australia. In many countries that use civil law as the foundation for their legal systems, the same legal effect is more typically achieved using a principle of duty to rescue.

Good Samaritan laws take their name from a parable found in the Bible, attributed to Jesus, commonly referred to as the Parable of the Good Samaritan which is contained in Luke 10:29–37. It recounts the aid given by a traveller from the area known as Samaria to another traveller of a conflicting religious and ethnic background who had been beaten and robbed by bandits.

==Regions==
Good Samaritan laws tend to differ by region, as each is crafted based on local interpretations of the providers protected, as well as the scope of care covered.

===Australia===
Most Australian states and territories have some form of Good Samaritan protection. In general, these offer protection if care is made in good faith, and the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; is not impaired by drugs or alcohol. Variations exist between states, from not applying if the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; is the cause of the problem (New South Wales), to applying under all circumstances if the attempt is made in good faith (Victoria).

===Belgium===
The Belgian Good Samaritan Law imposes on anyone who is capable to aid a legal duty to help a person, who is in great danger, without putting himself or others in serious danger (article 422bis Criminal Code).

===Canada===
In Canada, good Samaritan acts fall under provincial jurisdiction. Each province has its own act, such as Ontario&#x27;s and British Columbia&#x27;s respective Good Samaritan Acts, Alberta&#x27;s, Northwest Territories, Yukon&#x27;s and Nunavut&#x27;s Emergency Medical Aid Acts, and Nova Scotia&#x27;s Volunteer Services Act. Only in Quebec, a civil law jurisdiction, does a person have a general duty to respond, as detailed in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.

An example of a typical Canadian law is provided here, from Ontario&#x27;s Good Samaritan Act, 2001, section 2:

===China===
There have been incidents in China, such as the &quot;Peng Yu incident&quot; in 2006, where good Samaritans who helped people injured in accidents were accused of having injured the victim themselves.

In 2011, a toddler called Wang Yue was killed when she was run over by two vehicles. The entire incident was caught on a video, which shows eighteen people seeing the child but refusing to help. In a November 2011 survey, a majority, 71%, thought that the people who passed the child without helping were afraid of getting into trouble themselves. Following the event, &quot;China Daily&quot; reported that &quot;at least 10 Party and government departments and organizations in Guangdong, including the province&#x27;s commission on politics and law, the women&#x27;s federation, the Academy of Social Sciences, and the Communist Youth League, have started discussions on punishing those who refuse to help people who clearly need it.&quot; Officials of Guangdong province, along with many lawyers and social workers, also held three days of meetings in the provincial capital of Guangzhou to discuss the case. It was reported that various lawmakers of the province were drafting a good Samaritan law, which would &quot;penalize people who fail to help in a situation of this type and indemnify them from lawsuits if their efforts are in vain&quot;. Legal experts and the public debated the idea in preparation for discussions and a legislative push. On 1 August 2013, the nation&#x27;s first good Samaritan law went into effect in Shenzhen. On 1 October 2017, China&#x27;s national Good Samaritan law came into force, Clause 184 in Civil Law General Principles.

===Finland===
The Finnish Rescue Act explicitly stipulates a duty to rescue as a &quot;general duty to act&quot; and &quot;engage in rescue activities according to [one&#x27;s] abilities&quot;. The Finnish Rescue Act thus includes a principle of proportionality which requires professionals to extend immediate aid further than laypersons.

The Finnish Criminal Code stipulates:

===France===
In France, the law requires anyone to assist a person in danger or at the very least call for help. People who help are not liable for damages except if the damages are intentional or caused by a &quot;strong&quot; mistake.

===Germany===
In Germany, failure to provide first aid to a person in need is punishable under § 323c of its criminal penal code. However, any help one provides cannot and will not be prosecuted even if it made the situation worse or did not fulfill specific first aid criteria. People are thus encouraged to help in any way possible, even if the attempt is not successful. Moreover, people providing first aid are covered by the German Statutory Accident Insurance in case they suffer injury, losses, or damages.

===India===

There were around 480,000 road accidents in India in 2016, in which 150,000 people were killed. The Good Samaritan law gives legal protection to the good samaritans who help accidents victims with emergency medical care within the &quot;Golden Hour&quot;. People are thus encouraged to help in any way possible, even if the attempt is not successful.

===Ireland===
The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 2011 introduced legislation specifically addressing the liability of citizen good Samaritans or volunteers in the Republic of Ireland, without introducing a duty to intervene. This act provides for exemption from liability for a person, or voluntary organization, for anything done while providing &quot;assistance, advice or care&quot; to a person who is injured, in serious risk or danger of becoming injured or developing an illness (or apparently so). There are exclusions for cases of &quot;bad faith&quot; or &quot;gross negligence&quot; on behalf of the carer, and incidents relating to the negligent use of motor vehicles. This Act only addresses situations where there is no duty of care owed by the good Samaritan or the volunteer.

The pre-hospital emergency care council (PHECC) specifically addresses the good Samaritan section of the Civil Law Act of 2011 and states that &quot;The use of skills and medications restricted to Registered Practitioners would be covered under the &#x27;Good Samaritan&#x27; Act. This Act assumes that you had no intention to practice during this time and that you acted as a Good Samaritan, assisting until the Emergency Services arrive on scene and you can hand over.&quot;

===Israel===
In Israel, the law requires anyone to assist a person in danger or at the very least call for help. People who help in good faith are not liable for damages. Helpers are eligible for compensation for damages caused to them during their assistance.

===Japan===
In Japan, there are some laws that serve as an equivalent to Good Samaritan laws. For example, article 37 of the penal code states that:

&quot;An act a person was compelled to take to avert a present danger to the life, body, liberty or property of oneself or any other person is not punishable only when the harm produced by such act does not exceed the harm to be averted; provided, however, that an act causing excessive harm may lead to the punishment being reduced or may exculpate the offender in light of the circumstances.&quot;

Another Good Samaritan law appears in Article 698 of the Japanese civil code, where the law offers the helper protection from liability stating that:

&quot;If a manager engages in benevolent intervention in another&#x27;s business in order to allow a principal to escape imminent danger to the principal&#x27;s person, reputation, or property, the manager is not liable to compensate for damage resulting from this unless the manager has acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.&quot;

Furthermore, health professionals are subject to Duty to Rescue Laws.

===Romania===
In Romania, the health reform passed in 2006 states that persons without medical training offering basic first aid voluntarily at the indications of a medical dispatch office or from own knowledge of first aid maneuvers, acting in good will to preserve the life or health of another person cannot be held responsible under penal or civil law.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
In November 2020, the United Arab Emirates was the first Arab country to pass a Good Samaritan law.

===United Kingdom===
In the common law of England and Wales there is no criminal liability for failing to act in the event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action.

The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue. In England and Wales, the Social Action, Responsibility and Heroism Act 2015 helps protect &quot;good Samaritans&quot; when considering a claim of negligence or a breach of duty. This act is one of the shorter pieces of legislation in the UK with a length of just above 300 words, has thus far never been cited in court since becoming law, and is considered to be vague. The Labour Party at the time of the law&#x27;s passing criticized it for being valuable in concept but lacking an earnest effort.

===United States===
All fifty states and the District of Columbia have some type of Good Samaritan law. The details of good Samaritan laws vary by jurisdiction, including who is protected from liability and under what circumstances.

Examples of the Good Samaritan Law in the United States include: 

* The 1998 Aviation Medical Assistance Act which provides coverage for &quot;Good Samaritans&quot; while in flight.
* The Good Samaritan Food Donation Act of 1996 which provides limited liability protection for those who donate food.

==Countries without a Good Samaritan law==

The following countries have no Good Samaritan law:
*Pakistan
*South Africa
*New Zealand
*Singapore
*Philippines

==Common features==
Good Samaritan laws often sharing different combinations or interpretations of the similar features, which vary by region.

=== Duty to assist ===
In some jurisdictions, unless a caretaker relationship (such as a parent-child or doctor-patient relationship) exists prior to the illness or injury, or the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; is responsible for the existence of the illness or injury, no person is required to give aid of any sort to a victim. Good Samaritan statutes in the states of Minnesota, Vermont and Rhode Island do require a person at the scene of an emergency to provide reasonable assistance to a person in need. This assistance may be to call 9-1-1. Violation of the duty-to-assist subdivision is a petty misdemeanour in Minnesota and may warrant a fine of up to $100 in Vermont. At least five other states, including California and Nevada, have seriously considered adding duty-to-assist subdivisions to their Good Samaritan statutes. New York&#x27;s law provides immunity for those who assist in an emergency. The public policy behind the law is:

=== Imminent peril ===
Good Samaritan provisions are not universal in application. The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply. In the absence of imminent peril, the actions of a rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries, and no danger of a second collision. If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that Good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.

=== Reward or compensation ===
Only first aid provided without the intention of reward or financial compensation is covered. Medical professionals are typically not protected by Good Samaritan laws when performing first aid in connection with their employment. Some states make specific provisions for trained medical professionals acting as volunteers and for members of volunteer rescue squads acting without expectation of remuneration. In Texas, a physician who voluntarily assisted in the delivery of an infant, and who proved that he had &quot;no expectation of remuneration&quot;, had no liability for the infant&#x27;s injuries due to allegedly ordinary negligence; there was &quot;uncontroverted testimony that neither he nor any doctor in Travis County would have charged a fee to [the mother] or any other person under the circumstances of this case&quot;. It was significant that the doctor was not an employee of the attending physician, but was only visiting the hospital and had responded to a &quot;Dr. Stork&quot; page, and had not asked or expected to be paid.

=== Obligation to remain ===
If a responder begins rendering aid, she or he must not leave the scene until it is necessary to call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This can be as simple as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith, and in accordance with their level of training.

===Consent===
The responder must obtain the consent of the patient, or of the legal guardian of a patient who is a minor, unless this is not possible; failing to do so may attract a charge of assault or battery.

====Implied consent====
Consent may be implied if an unattended patient is unconscious, delusional, intoxicated, or deemed mentally unfit to make decisions regarding his or her safety, or if the responder has a reasonable belief that this was so; courts tend to be very forgiving in adjudicating this, under the legal fiction that &quot;peril invites rescue&quot; (as in the rescue doctrine). The test in most jurisdictions is that of the &quot;average, reasonable person&quot;. To illustrate, would the average, reasonable person in any of the states described above consent to receiving assistance in these circumstances is able to make a decision?

Consent may also be implied if the legal parent or guardian is not immediately reachable and the patient is not considered an adult.

====Parental consent====
If the victim is a minor, consent must come from a parent or guardian. However, if the legal parent or guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional, or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder is not required to withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) from a minor if the parent or guardian will not consent. The parent or guardian is then considered neglecting the minor, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).

====Laws for first responders only====
In some jurisdictions, Good Samaritan laws only protect those who have completed basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations, such as the American Heart Association, or American Red Cross, provided that they have acted within the scope of their training. In these jurisdictions, a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and who performs first aid incorrectly, can be held legally liable for errors made. In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally. In Florida, paramedics, EMTs, and emergency medical responders (first responders) are required by law to act under the Duty to Act law, which requires them to stop and give aid that falls within their practice.

==Comparison with duty to rescue==
Good Samaritan laws may be confused with the duty to rescue, as described above. U.S. and Canadian approaches to this issue differ. Under the common law, Good Samaritan laws provide a defense against torts arising from the attempted rescue. Such laws do not constitute a duty to rescue, such as exists in some civil law countries, and in the common law under certain circumstances. However, the duty to rescue where it exists may itself imply a shield from liability; for example, under the German law of &quot;Unterlassene Hilfeleistung&quot; (an offense not to provide first aid when necessary), a citizen is obliged to provide first aid when necessary and is immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith turns out to be harmful. In Canada, all provinces with the exception of Quebec operate on the basis of English Common Law. Quebec operates a civil law system, based in part on the Napoleonic Code, and the principle of duty to rescue does apply. Similarly, in France anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.

To illustrate a variation in the concept of duty to rescue, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides all workers with the right to refuse to perform unsafe work. There are, however, specific exceptions to this right. When the &quot;life, health or safety of another person is at risk&quot;, then specific groups, including &quot;police officers, firefighters, or employees of a hospital, clinic or other type of medical worker (including EMS)&quot; are specifically excluded from the right to refuse unsafe work.

<text>Norman Frederick Jewison (July 21, 1926 – January 20, 2024) was a Canadian filmmaker. He was known for directing films which addressed topical social and political issues, often making controversial or complicated subjects accessible to mainstream audiences. Among numerous other accolades, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director three times in three separate decades, for &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971), and &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987). He was nominated for an additional four Oscars, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award, and won a BAFTA Award. He received the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences&#x27;s Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1999.

Born and raised in Toronto, Jewison began his career at CBC Television in the 1950s, moving to the United States later in the decade to work at NBC. He made his feature film debut in 1962, with the comedy &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble,&quot; and embarked on a motion picture directing career that spanned over 40 years. His notable films included &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966), &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968), &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; (1978), &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979), &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; (1984), &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1999).

In 1988, Jewison founded the Canadian Film Centre. In 2003, he received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement for his multiple contributions to the film industry in Canada. He was Chancellor of Victoria University in the University of Toronto, his alma mater, from 2004 until 2010.

==Early life and education==
Jewison was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Dorothy Irene (née Weaver) and Percy Joseph Jewison (1890–1974), who managed a convenience store and post office. He attended Kew Beach School and Malvern Collegiate Institute, and while growing up in the 1930s displayed an aptitude for performing and theatre. He was often mistaken for being Jewish due to his surname and direction of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, but Jewison and his family are Protestants (Methodists) of English descent. He served in the Royal Canadian Navy (1944–1945) during World War II, and after being discharged travelled in the American South, where he encountered segregation, an experience that influenced his later work.

Jewison attended Victoria College in the University of Toronto, graduating with a B.A. in 1949. As a student, he was involved in writing, directing, and acting in various theatrical productions, including the All-Varsity Revue in 1949. Following graduation, he moved to London, where he worked sporadically as a script writer for a children&#x27;s television program and bit part actor for the BBC, while supporting himself with odd jobs. Out of work in Britain in late 1951, he returned to Canada to become a production trainee at CBLT in Toronto, which was preparing for the launch of CBC Television.

==Career==
=== 1952–1964: Early work ===

When CBC Television went on the air in the fall of 1952, Jewison was an assistant director. During the next seven years he wrote, directed, and produced a wide variety of musicals, comedy-variety shows, dramas, and specials, including &quot;The Big Revue&quot;, &quot;Showtime&quot;, and &quot;The Barris Beat&quot;. In 1953 he married Margaret Ann &quot;Dixie&quot; Dixon, a former model. They had three children – Michael, Kevin, and Jennifer – who all pursued careers in the entertainment industry. In 1958 Jewison was recruited to work for NBC in New York, where his first assignment was &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, followed by &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. The success of these shows led to directing specials featuring performers such as Harry Belafonte, Jackie Gleason, and Danny Kaye. The television production that proved pivotal to Jewison&#x27;s career was the Judy Garland &quot;comeback&quot; special that aired in 1961, which included Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, and led to a weekly show that Jewison was later called in to direct. Visiting the studio during rehearsal for the special, actor Tony Curtis suggested to Jewison that he should direct a feature film.

Jewison&#x27;s career as a film director began when Tony Curtis&#x27; and Janet Leigh&#x27;s film production company, Curtleigh Productions, hired him to direct the comedy &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; in February 1962. The film was financed and distributed by Universal-International Pictures and was the first motion picture ever filmed at Disneyland. Curtleigh Productions&#x27; contract with Jewison had a negotiable option for further films if the initial picture was successful. In early October 1962, Jewison formed his own independent film production company, Simkoe Productions, and signed a two-picture deal with Curtis&#x27; new film production company, Curtis Enterprises, as well as an additional two-picture deal with Universal-International Pictures. Although the two pictures for Curtis Enterprises were not made, both films for Universal-International Pictures were. He made two comedies starring Doris Day: &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot;, released in 1963 and co-starring James Garner, and &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot;, released in 1964 and co-starring Rock Hudson. After another comedy, &quot;The Art of Love&quot; (1965), Jewison was determined to escape from the genre and tackle more demanding projects.

=== 1965–1987: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

His breakthrough film proved to be &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), a drama starring Steve McQueen, and Jewison considered it one of his personal favourites because it was his first challenging drama. This success was followed in 1966 by a satire on Cold War paranoia, &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;; it was the first film Jewison also produced, and it was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He felt that doing &quot;a plea for coexistence, or the absurdity of international conflict was important right at that moment&quot;. While reaction to &quot;Russians&quot; was positive, Jewison was labelled as &quot;a Canadian pinko&quot; by right-wing commentators.

Continuing his string of successes was one of the films that has become closely identified with Jewison as its director, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), a crime drama set in a racially divided Southern town and starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while Jewison was nominated for Best Director. While he was filming, Robert Kennedy told Jewison that this could be &quot;a very important film. Timing is everything&quot;. Kennedy reminded Jewison of that prediction a year and a half later when he presented him with the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for best drama. As a follow-up he directed and produced another film with McQueen, using innovative multiple screen images in the crime caper &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968). From that point Jewison produced all feature films he directed, often with associate Patrick Palmer, and he also acted as producer for films directed by others, beginning with his former film editor Hal Ashby&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1970). After the completion of the period comedy &quot;Gaily, Gaily&quot; (1969), Jewison, having become disenchanted with the political climate in the United States, moved his family to England.
At Pinewood Studios northwest of London, and on location in Yugoslavia, he worked on the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971, re-issued 1979), which won three Oscars and was nominated for five others, including Best Picture and Director. During the filming of &quot;Fiddler&quot;, Jewison was also the subject of the 1971 National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;Norman Jewison, Filmmaker&quot;, directed by Douglas Jackson. Jewison&#x27;s next project was the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), based on the Broadway musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It was filmed in Israel, where Jewison also produced the western &quot;Billy Two Hats&quot; (1974), starring Gregory Peck. &quot;Superstar&quot;, controversial for its treatment of a religious subject, was followed by another movie that sparked critical debate, this time over violence. &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975) is set in the near future when corporations rule the world and entertainment is centred around a deadly game. The next film he directed, the labour union drama &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; (1978), loosely based on the life of Jimmy Hoffa, also provided some controversy, this time regarding the screenwriting credit. Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was unhappy to share the screenwriting credit with the film&#x27;s star Sylvester Stallone, as he felt that Stallone&#x27;s input had been minor, while Stallone claimed to have basically rewritten the whole script.

In 1978 Jewison returned to Canada, settling in the Caledon area in Ontario and establishing a farm that produced prizewinning cattle, as well as maple syrup. Operating from a base in Toronto, as well as one maintained in California, he directed high-profile actors Al Pacino in &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979), and Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn in the romantic comedy &quot;Best Friends&quot; (1982), and he produced &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (1981) and &quot;Iceman&quot; (1984). During this period Jewison also produced the 53rd Annual Academy Awards (1981), which was slated to air the day President Ronald Reagan was shot and had to be rescheduled. Revisiting the theme of racial tension that had characterised &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, Jewison&#x27;s &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; (1984), based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play, was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. His next film was also based on a successful play. &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985), set in a Quebec convent, starred Jane Fonda, Meg Tilly, and Anne Bancroft; it received three Academy Award nominations. In 1986, he then discontinued the agreement with film producer Columbia Pictures, citing the behaviour of British filmmaker and head of production David Puttnam. After the falling out with Columbia, his Yorktown Productions company was moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a three-year agreement to direct, produce, and develop pictures from the studio, and gave MGM the right of first refusal on films he wished to make. Jewison&#x27;s next film proved to be one of the most popular romantic films ever made. &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987), starring Cher, was a box office hit that garnered three Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Cher. Jewison also received his third Best Director nomination.

=== 1988–2001 ===
For the next decade Jewison continued to direct feature films released by major studios: &quot;In Country&quot; (1989), a drama concerned with Vietnam veterans and the daughter of a war casualty; &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot; (1991), a social comedy about greed in the 1980s; &quot;Only You&quot; (1994), a romantic comedy set in Italy; and &quot;Bogus&quot; (1996), a fantasy about a young boy and his imaginary friend. He also served as producer for the film &quot;January Man&quot; (1989), executive producer for the Canadian movie &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot;, and branched back into television both as director and producer, including the TNT biographical film &quot;&quot;Geronimo&quot;&quot; (1993) and the series &quot;The Rez&quot; (1996–1998).

&quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1999) was Jewison&#x27;s third film to explore the effects of racism, telling the story of boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, who had been falsely convicted for a triple murder in New Jersey during the mid-1960s. Denzel Washington won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Carter. In 1999, Jewison&#x27;s work was recognised by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when he was given the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement. Jewison continued directing and producing up until his last film to be released, the 2003 thriller &quot;The Statement&quot;, based on a novel by Brian Moore starring Michael Caine. That same year his autobiography &quot;This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me&quot; was published, expressing the enthusiasm, conviction, and creative passion that sustained his career.

In 1999, he directed the HBO television movie &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; starring Andie MacDowell, Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, and Dennis Quaid. The film was based on the play of the same name by Donald Margulies. Jewison was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.

Describing the key characteristic of the films he made, he once said: &quot;I want people to recognise themselves in the movies I make. I don&#x27;t enjoy no-brainer action movies.&quot;

==Canadian Film Centre==
Jewison&#x27;s commitment and contribution to film in Canada is evidenced by his creation of the Canadian Centre for Advanced Film Studies in 1986, which opened two years later as an advanced film school on Windfields Estate in Toronto, Ontario. This was subsequently renamed the Canadian Film Centre (CFC).

More than 1,700 alumni and 100 alumni companies have come out of CFC&#x27;s programs to date, including Shaftesbury Films, Conquering Lion Pictures, CopperHeart Entertainment, Smiley Guy Studios, and Secret Location. The centre has helped incubate and/or develop groundbreaking original content, including hit television series &quot;Orphan Black&quot; (from creators Graeme Manson and John Fawcett, CFC alumni), the award-winning first feature &quot;Closet Monster&quot; (from writer/director alumnus Stephen Dunn), and internationally award-winning documentary feature &quot;Stories We Tell&quot; (from director and CFC alumna Sarah Polley).

Additionally, feature films such as &quot;Rhymes for Young Ghouls&quot; (director Jeff Barnaby), &quot;Cube&quot; (director Vincenzo Natali), and &quot;Rude&quot; (director Clement Virgo) have been developed and produced through CFC Features.

Each year in Los Angeles, Jewison bestowed the CFC Award for Creative Excellence to CFC alumni in recognition of their outstanding work and contributions to the screen-based entertainment industry. Jewison presented the inaugural award to CFC alumna Semi Chellas (&quot;Mad Men&quot;) in 2014, to Graeme Manson and John Fawcett (&quot;Orphan Black&quot;) in 2015, and to Don McKellar (&quot;The Red Violin&quot;, &quot;Highway 61&quot;) in 2016.

Jewison was the Chair Emeritus of the CFC.

==Personal life==
Norman Jewison and Margaret Ann Dixon married on July 11, 1953. She died on November 26, 2004, the day following her 74th birthday, in Orangeville, Ontario, from undisclosed causes. They had three children and five grandchildren.

In recognition of his contributions to the arts, as well as his sustained support, Jewison was installed as Chancellor of Victoria University in the University of Toronto in 2004; he held the position until October 2010.

In 2010 Blake Goldring donated $1,000,000 to Victoria University at the University of Toronto to establish a specialised first-year liberal arts program in Jewison&#x27;s name. The program began in September 2011 welcoming fewer than 30 select students into Norman Jewison Stream for Imagination and the Arts. Goldring is a 1981 graduate of the school.

<text>An emergency telephone number is a number that allows a caller to contact local emergency services for assistance. The emergency number differs from country to country; it is typically a three-digit number so that it can be easily remembered and dialed quickly. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit.

In many countries, dialing either 112 (used in Europe and parts of Asia, Africa and South America) or 911 (used mostly in the Americas) will connect callers to emergency services. For individual countries, see the list of emergency telephone numbers.

== Configuration and operation ==
The emergency telephone number is a special case in the country&#x27;s telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the emergency telephone number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though with the advent of electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an emergency telephone number, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.

An emergency telephone number call may be answered by either a telephone operator or an emergency service dispatcher. The nature of the emergency (police, fire, medical, coast guard) is then determined. If the call has been answered by a telephone operator, they then connect the call to the appropriate emergency service, who then dispatches the appropriate help. In the case of multiple services being needed on a call, the most urgent need must be determined, with other services being called in as needed.

Emergency dispatchers are trained to control the call in order to provide help in an appropriate manner; they can be assisted by computer aided call handling systems (CACH). The emergency dispatcher may find it necessary to give urgent advice in life-threatening situations. Some dispatchers have special training in telling people how to perform first aid or CPR.

In many parts of the world, an emergency service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from. This is normally done using the system that the telephone company uses to bill calls, making the number visible even for users who have unlisted numbers or who block caller ID. Enhanced 911 and similar systems like E112 can provide the location of landline callers by looking up the physical address in a database, and mobile callers through triangulation from towers or GPS on the device. This is often specifically mandated in a country&#x27;s telecommunication law.

== Operator-assisted dialing ==
When an emergency happened in the pre-dial (or &quot;manual&quot;) telephone era, the user simply picked up the telephone receiver and waited for the operator to answer &quot;number, please?&quot;. The user then responded with &quot;get me the police&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m calling to report a fire&quot;, or &quot;I need an ambulance/doctor&quot;. Even in large cities, it was seldom necessary to ask for these services by number.

In small towns, operators frequently provided additional services, knowing where to reach doctors, veterinarians, law enforcement personnel and firefighters at all times. Frequently, the operator was also responsible for activating the town&#x27;s fire alarm.

When manual switching systems began to be replaced by automatic, or &quot;dial&quot; systems, there was frequently concern among users that the very personalized emergency service provided by manual operators would be lost.

Because numbers were different for every exchange, callers either had to dial the operator or look up the telephone number. This problem was at least partially solved in Canada, the UK, and the US by dialing &quot;0&quot; for the local assistance operator in case of emergency, although faster service could be obtained if the user dialed the full number for the Police or Fire Department. This system remained essentially unchanged throughout most of North America until the 1970s.

== Direct-dial numbers ==

=== 999 ===
The first emergency number system to be deployed anywhere in the world was in London on 30 June 1937 using the number 999, and this was later extended to cover the entire country. When 999 was dialed, a buzzer sounded and a red light flashed in the exchange to attract an operator&#x27;s attention.

The emergency number 999 was adopted in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1959 at the urging of Stephen Juba, mayor of Winnipeg at the time. The city changed the number to 911 in 1972, in order to be consistent with the newly adopted U.S. emergency number.

Several other countries besides the UK have adopted 999 as their emergency number.

=== 911 ===
Because of the design of U.S. central office (phone) switches, it was not practical to use the British emergency number 999 (as was briefly considered). What was up to that time unassigned area code 911 was chosen instead. The &quot;1&quot; as the second digit was key; it told the switching equipment that this was not a routine call. (At the time, when the second digit was &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; the equipment handled the call as a long distance or special number call.) The first 911 emergency phone system went into use by the Alabama Telephone Company in Haleyville, Alabama in 1968. On February 16, 1968, the first-ever 9-1-1 call was placed by Alabama Speaker of the House Rankin Fite, from Haleyville City Hall, to U.S. Rep. Tom Bevill, at the city&#x27;s police station. However, 911 systems were not in widespread use until the 1980s when the number 911 was adopted as the standard number across most of the country under the North American Numbering Plan.

The implementation of 911 service in the US was a gradual and haphazard process. Because telephone service boundaries did not always exactly match governmental and other jurisdictional boundaries, a user might dial 911, only to discover that they had been connected to the wrong dispatch center because they had telephone service from one location but lived within the boundaries of another jurisdiction.

Electromechanical switching equipment still in use made it difficult to adapt to recognize 911, especially in small towns and rural areas where the call might have to be switched over a considerable distance. For this reason, there are still county sheriff departments that have toll-free &quot;800&quot; area code numbers.

The rapid replacement of electromechanical switching systems in the 1980s with electronic or digital systems eliminated the problem of older switches that would not recognize 911. At this point, 911 service is available in most of North America, but there are still small, sparsely-populated, or remote areas (such as Nunavut and the Northwest Territories in Canada&#x27;s Arctic) that do not have it.

;Enhanced 911
Gradually, various problems were overcome; &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;enhanced 911&quot; systems were developed that not only would display the caller&#x27;s number and address at the dispatch center but also could be configured so that 911 calls were automatically routed to the correct dispatch center, regardless of what central office the caller was served from. In the United States, most cities have E911 systems either in use, or in their emergency systems design plans.

=== 17, 18 ===
In France, many telephone exchanges were closed at night but it was still possible to make emergency calls. An operator had to connect the emergency calls only. In 1913, an automatic system was set up. It made provision for calling the police by dialing 17 and the fire brigade by dialing 18. As more manual telephone exchanges were converted to dial operation, more and more subscribers had access to these special numbers. The service was not widespread until the 1970s.

France now uses 112, the European emergency number, as well as 17 and 18 for police and fire brigade, specific to France.

=== 100, 101, 102 ===
100, 101, and 102 are the emergency telephone numbers in Israel, serving the police, Magen David Adom and the fire department accordingly.
=== 110 ===
110 is the emergency telephone number for the police in China, Germany, Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan.

=== 111 ===
The emergency number 111 was adopted in New Zealand in 1955 and was first implemented in Masterton and Carterton in September 1958. New Zealand telephones had their rotary dials numbered in reverse to the UK and most of the world, with the number 1 on New Zealand rotary phones in the same position as the number 9 on British rotary phones. Dialling 111 would be recognised by the British-built step-by-step exchanges then used as a 999 emergency call, which would route the call accordingly.

=== 112 ===

The CEPT recommended the use of 112 in 1972. The European Union subsequently adopted the 112 number as a standard on 29 July 1991. It is now a valid emergency number throughout EU countries and in many other CEPT countries. It works in parallel with other local emergency numbers in about two out of three EU states.

=== 116 ===
Southern California Telephone Co. began using 116 as an emergency line for Los Angeles, California in 1946.

=== 119 ===

119 is an emergency telephone number in countries like for example China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

=== 120 ===
120 is the emergency telephone number for ambulance service in China.

=== 122 ===
122 is an emergency telephone number in several countries. For example, it is used for fire emergencies in Austria, for traffic emergencies in China, and for police emergencies in Egypt.

=== 000 ===
Prior to 1969, Australia lacked a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services possessed many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the Postmaster General (PMG) introduced the Triple Zero (000) number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number Triple Zero (000) was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialing system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialing 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones, so it was easy to dial in darkness. The Telecommunications Numbering Plan 1997, also administered by ACMA, specifies that:

* the primary emergency service number is &#x27;000&#x27; and
* the secondary emergency service numbers are &#x27;106&#x27; and &#x27;112&#x27;.

=== 1122 ===

1122 is an emergency telephone number in Pakistan. It can be used to call for fire and medical emergencies.

== Standardisation ==
=== ITU standard: 112 or 911 ===
The International Telecommunication Union has officially set two standard emergency phone numbers for countries to use in the future. AP reports that member states have agreed that either 911 or 112 should be designated as emergency phone numbers – 911 is more commonly used in the Americas, while 112 is standard across the EU and in many other countries worldwide.

=== IP telephony ===
In January 2008, the Internet Engineering Task Force released a set of RFC documents pertaining to emergency calls in IP networks.

== Mobile telephony ==
Mobile phones can be used in countries with different emergency numbers. This means that a traveller visiting a foreign country does not have to know the local emergency numbers. The mobile phone and the SIM card have a preprogrammed list of emergency numbers. When the user tries to set up a call using an emergency number known by a GSM or 3G phone, the special emergency call setup takes place. The actual number is not even transmitted into the network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk. Most GSM mobile phones can dial emergency numbers even when the phone keyboard is locked, the phone is without a SIM card, emergency number is entered instead of the PIN or there is not a network signal (busy network).

Most GSM mobile phones have 112, 999 and 911 as pre-programmed emergency numbers that are always available. The SIM card issued by the operator can contain additional country-specific emergency numbers that can be used even when roaming abroad. The GSM network can also update the list of well-known emergency numbers when the phone registers to it.

Using an emergency number recognized by a GSM phone like &quot;112&quot; instead of another emergency number may be advantageous, since GSM phones and networks give special priority to emergency calls. A phone dialing an emergency service number not recognized by it may refuse to roam onto another network, leading to trouble if there is no access to the home network. Dialing a known emergency number like &quot;112&quot; forces the phone to try the call with any available network.

On some networks, a GSM phone without a SIM card may be used to make emergency calls, and most GSM phones accept a larger list of emergency numbers without SIM card, such as &quot;112&quot;, &quot;911&quot;, &quot;118&quot;, &quot;119&quot;, &quot;000&quot;, &quot;110&quot;, &quot;08&quot;, and &quot;999&quot;. However, some GSM networks will not accept emergency calls from phones without a SIM card. For example, to decrease the risk of nuisance calls, French and British networks typically do not allow emergency calls without a SIM card.

The GSM phones may regard some phone numbers with one or two digits as special service codes. It might be impossible to make an emergency call to numbers like &quot;03&quot; or &quot;92&quot; with a mobile phone. In those cases the emergency number has to be called by using a landline telephone or with an additional first/last digit (for example 922 or 992 instead of 92 and 003 or 033 instead of 03).

In the United States, the FCC requires networks to route every mobile-phone and payphone 911 call to an emergency service call center, including phones that have never had service, or whose service has lapsed. As a result, there are programs that provide donated used mobile phones to victims of domestic violence and others especially likely to need emergency services. Since 2020, emergency responders have been able to better locate callers who dial 911 on their cellphones from indoors as the U.S. wireless industry improved caller-location for the majority of such calls. The &quot;heightened location accuracy,&quot; available to supporting networks and handsets, can find callers through nearby devices connected to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth that are logged with a specific location in a special emergency-services database.

Mobile phones generate additional problems for emergency operators, as many phones will allow emergency numbers to be dialed even while the keypad is locked. Since mobile phones are typically carried in pockets and small bags, the keys can easily be depressed accidentally, leading to unintended calls. A system has been developed in the UK to connect calls where the caller is sent to an automated system, leaving more operators free to handle genuine emergency calls.

== Electro-mechanical issues ==
As earlier telephone systems used loop disconnect dialing, attention was devoted to avoiding the number being dialed accidentally by errant interruptions of the circuits by making them involve long sequences of pulses, such as with the UK 999 emergency number. This meant that &quot;111&quot; could not be used: &quot;111&quot; dialing could accidentally take place when phone lines were in too close proximity to each other. Subscribers, as they were called then, were even given instructions on how to find the number &quot;9&quot; on the dial in darkened, or smoke-filled, rooms, by locating and placing the first finger in the &quot;0&quot; and the second in the &quot;9&quot;, then removing the first when actually dialling. Some people have reported accidentally dialing 112 by loop-disconnect for various technical reasons, including while working on extension telephone wiring, and point to this as a disadvantage of the 112 emergency number, which takes only four loop-disconnects to activate.

<text>George Dewey (December 26, 1837January 16, 1917) was Admiral of the Navy, the only person in United States history to have attained that rank. He is best known for his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War, with the loss of only a single crewman on the American side.

Dewey was born in Montpelier, Vermont. At age 15, Dewey&#x27;s father enrolled him at Norwich University in Northfield, Vermont. Two years later Norwich expelled him for drunkenness and herding sheep into the barracks. Summarily, he entered the United States Naval Academy in 1854. He graduated from the academy in 1858 and was assigned as the executive lieutenant of the at the beginning of the Civil War. He participated in the capture of New Orleans and the Siege of Port Hudson, helping the Union take control of the Mississippi River. By the end of the war, Dewey reached the rank of lieutenant commander.

After the Civil War, Dewey undertook a variety of assignments, serving on multiple ships (including the ) and as an instructor at the Naval Academy. He also served on the United States Lighthouse Board and the Board of Inspection and Survey. He was promoted to commodore in 1896 and assigned to the Asiatic Squadron the following year. After that appointment, he began preparations for a potential war with Spain, which broke out in April 1898. Immediately after the beginning of the war, Dewey led an attack on Manila Bay, sinking or capturing the entire Spanish Pacific fleet while suffering only minor casualties. After the battle, his fleet assisted in the capture of Manila. Dewey&#x27;s victory at Manila Bay was widely lauded in the United States, and he was promoted to Admiral of the Navy in 1903.

Dewey explored a run for the 1900 Democratic presidential nomination, but he withdrew from the race and endorsed President William McKinley. He served on the General Board of the United States Navy, an important policy-making body, from 1900 until his death in 1917.

==Early life==
Dewey was born in Montpelier, Vermont, on December 26, 1837, directly opposite the Vermont State House, to Julius Yemans Dewey and his first wife, Mary Perrin. Julius was a physician who received his degree from The University of Vermont. He was among the founders of the National Life Insurance Company in 1848, a member of the Episcopal Church, and was among the founders of the Christ Episcopal Church in Montpelier. George was baptized and attended Sunday school there. George had two older brothers and a younger sister.

Dewey&#x27;s third cousin twice removed was Thomas E. Dewey, Governor of New York and two time Republican Party presidential nominee.

Dewey attended school in the nearby town of Johnson. When he was fifteen years old he went to the American Literary Scientific and Military Academy. The school, better known as Norwich University, had been founded by Alden Partridge and aimed at giving cadets a well-rounded military education. Dewey attended for two years (1852–1854). Dewey found a military role model when he read a biography of Hannibal.

==Naval career==

===Naval Academy===
Dewey entered the United States Naval Academy in 1854 at the age of 16. The conventional four-year course had just been introduced in 1851 and the cadet corps was quite small, averaging about one hundred Acting Midshipmen. Out of all that entered in his year, only fourteen stayed through the course. He stood fifth on the class roll at graduation. He graduated from the Academy on June 18, 1858.

===Midshipman===
As a midshipman, Dewey first went to sea on a practice cruise aboard ; on this cruise he earned recognition as a cadet officer. As a result, he was assigned to one of the best ships of the old Navy—the steam frigate . &quot;Wabash&quot; under Captain Samuel Barron was the new flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron. On July 22, 1858, the ship left Hampton Roads for Europe.

&quot;Wabash&quot; reached her first port of call, Gibraltar, on August 17, 1858. She cruised in the Mediterranean, and the cadet officers visited the cities of the Old World accessible to them, often taking trips inland. Dewey was assigned to keep the ship&#x27;s log. &quot;Wabash&quot; returned to the New York Navy Yard on December 16, 1859, and decommissioned there on December 20, 1859. Dewey served on two short-term cruises in 1860.

===Civil War service===
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Dewey was executive lieutenant on , a steam paddle frigate assigned to the Union West Gulf Blockading Squadron.

====Attack on New Orleans====
At the beginning of 1862, &quot;Mississippi&quot; was attached to David Farragut&#x27;s fleet for the capture of New Orleans. On the night of April 24–25, 1862, Farragut led his ships up the Mississippi River past the Confederate defenses at Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson. &quot;Mississippi&quot; was the third in Farragut&#x27;s first division, with Dewey at the helm.

The first division (all big ships) kept near the west bank where the current was weaker and the water deeper; but this brought them right under the muzzles of the guns of Fort St. Philip. Dewey steered &quot;Mississippi&quot; through shallow water where he expected to run aground any moment.

There was a squadron of Confederate gunboats waiting above the forts. This included , a small ironclad. &quot;Manassas&quot; tried to ram &quot;Mississippi&quot;, but Dewey safely maneuvered &quot;Mississippi&quot; to evade. &quot;Manassas&quot; then attacked and in the next division, and then turned back upriver.

Farragut signaled &quot;Mississippi&quot; to run &quot;Manassas&quot; down. Dewey steered &quot;Mississippi&quot; into a ramming attack. &quot;Manassas&quot; dodged, but ran aground and was abandoned. She was set on fire by a boat from &quot;Mississippi&quot;, and then shelled.
Farragut&#x27;s fleet then continued upriver and forced the surrender of the city.

This was the first battle in which Dewey distinguished himself. For the remainder of 1862, Farragut&#x27;s ships (including &quot;Mississippi&quot;) patrolled the lower river. This was dangerous, as the ships were fired on by Confederate sharpshooters on the banks, and even occasionally by light artillery.

====Battle of Port Hudson====

In spring 1863, Union forces moved to take the Confederate fortress at Port Hudson, Louisiana, where at that time the Red River joined the Mississippi. Farragut attempted to pass the fortress with his fleet and cut it off upriver, thereby completing the Siege of Port Hudson.

The attempt was made on March 14, 1863. In this action, Dewey saw fiercer fighting than he was ever to see again. &quot;Mississippi&quot; ran aground and was the target of concentrated enemy fire for half an hour, until she had to be abandoned. Dewey was among the last to leave the wreck.

===Assignment to USS &quot;Agawam&quot;===
Dewey was highly complimented by his immediate superiors and by Farragut himself, who appointed him executive officer of , a small gunboat the admiral used frequently for dispatches and his personal reconnoitering. This little vessel was frequently under fire by concealed sharpshooters and temporary batteries. In July of that year a small engagement at Donaldsonville, Louisiana, resulted in the death of Captain Abner Read, of USS &quot;New London&quot;, and the severe wounding of his executive officer. Dewey was present, and was so conspicuous for gallantry that he was recommended for promotion on the strength of it. Meanwhile, he was given temporary command of the frigate.

===Assignment to USS &quot;Colorado&quot;===
In the latter part of 1864, after some service in the James River under Commander McComb, Lieutenant Dewey was made executive officer of the first-rate wooden man-of-war , in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron under command of Commodore Henry Knox Thatcher.

===Battles of Fort Fisher===
By late 1864, Wilmington, North Carolina, was the only port left to the Confederacy. Its access to the sea was protected by Fort Fisher, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River.

A joint Army-Navy attack in December failed (the First Battle of Fort Fisher, December 7–27, 1864).

A second attack came in January (the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, January 13–15, 1865). &quot;Colorado&quot; was engaged, and Dewey played a key role in her success.

&quot;Colorado&quot;, being a wooden ship, was placed in the line outside the monitors and other armored vessels but got a full share of conflict. Toward the end of the second engagement, when matters were moving the right way, Admiral Porter signaled Thatcher to close in and silence a certain part of the works. As &quot;Colorado&quot; had already received considerable damage, her officers remonstrated. But Dewey, who had now acquired marked tactical ability, was quick to see the advantage to be gained by the move and the work was taken in fifteen minutes. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commenting upon this part of the action, spoke of it as &quot;the most beautiful duel of the war&quot;. When Admiral Porter came to congratulate Commodore Thatcher, the latter said generously: &quot;You must thank Lieutenant Dewey, sir. It was his move.&quot; Nevertheless, Thatcher was promoted to rear admiral. He tried to take Dewey with him as his fleet captain when he went to supersede Farragut at Mobile Bay. This was not permitted, but Dewey was promoted to lieutenant commander.

==Post–Civil War life==
After the end of the Civil War, then Lieutenant Commander Dewey remained in active service, and was sent to the European station as executive officer of —the famous ship that had sunk the Confederate privateer &quot;Alabama&quot;.

===Peacetime assignments===
Dewey&#x27;s next tour of duty was in 1867 and 1868 as executive officer of —the same vessel in which he had won his honors at Fort Fisher, and now the flagship of the European Squadron. The admiral in command of the ship and squadron was Louis M. Goldsborough, and one of Dewey&#x27;s companions was John Crittenden Watson—the same man, who, as rear admiral, relieved Admiral Dewey of his duties at Manila, when he wished to return to the United States in the summer of 1899. Lieutenant Commander Dewey was in charge of the vessels at the Naval Academy in Annapolis from November 6, 1867, through August 1, 1870. This duty included commanding the famous frigate , which was berthed at Annapolis as a training ship.

Some tranquil years followed the end of Dewey&#x27;s cruise on &quot;Colorado&quot;. For two years, from 1868 to 1870, he was an instructor at the Naval Academy. The next year he did special surveying work on the steam sloop . He was then briefly assigned to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. It was during this assignment that his wife died just after the birth of his son. In 1873, Dewey was given command of &quot;Narragansett&quot; and spent nearly four years on her, engaged in the Pacific Coast Survey.

===Lighthouse Board===
This entitled him to a period of rest ashore; and he was ordered to Washington, and made lighthouse inspector in 1880, and then secretary of the lighthouse board, a service in which he took great interest. Meanwhile, he had been promoted to the grade of commander. This residence in Washington as a bureau officer of high rank gave him an extensive acquaintance, and he became one of the most popular men in the capital. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the leading social club of Washington.

===Assignments 1882 – 1896===
In 1882, this leave of absence in Washington came to an end when he was sent to the Asiatic station in command of , where he studied the situation with care and acquired information of immense importance ten years later.

He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1884, and he was ordered home and given command of —one of the first four ships of the original &quot;white squadron&quot;, steam-powered ships with steel hulls which formed the basis of the modern United States Navy. &quot;Dolphin&quot; was officially classed as a dispatch boat, and was often used as the Presidential yacht.

In 1885, Captain Dewey undertook another tour of sea service, and for three years was in command of , familiar to him in the New Orleans battles, now flagship of the European squadron.

Returning to Washington in 1893, he resumed the life of a bureau officer, being attached to the lighthouse board. In 1896, he was promoted to commodore and transferred to the Board of Inspection and Survey.

==Spanish–American War==
===Commander of Asiatic Squadron===

In 1896, Dewey applied for a sea posting as commander of the Asiatic Squadron. Although Dewey was a long shot for the position, his friend Theodore Roosevelt arranged for President William McKinley to select Dewey over a more senior officer. The Commodore hoisted his pennant on board at Nagasaki in January 1898, and departed for Hong Kong in February to inspect the U.S. warships lying in Hong Kong harbour. Upon arrival, he learned that the had blown up in Havana Harbor. Dewey was skeptical that the country would go to war, writing, &quot;I don&#x27;t see what we have to gain in a war with Spain.&quot; However, he was confident of victory, writing, &quot;I expect to capture the Spanish ships and reduce the defenses of Manila in one day.&quot;

As the war clouds loomed, Dewey assembled his squadron at Hong Kong and made preparations. The cruiser was dispatched to Hong Kong via the Republic of Hawaii. Dewey purchased the merchant colliers and , retaining their crews. The warships were repainted from white to gray. Upon the outbreak of war between the United States and Spain, the United Kingdom declared its neutrality and Dewey was ordered by Wilsone Black to leave British waters. The Asiatic Squadron moved to the Chinese waters of Mirs Bay.

===Battle of Manila Bay===


On April 27, 1898, he sailed from China aboard with orders to attack the Spanish at Manila Bay. He stopped at the mouth of the bay late the night of April 30, and the following morning he gave the order to attack at first light, saying the now famous words &quot;You may fire when you are ready, Gridley.&quot; True to his word, Dewey defeated the Spanish in a battle lasting just six hours. The Asiatic Squadron sank or captured the entire Spanish Pacific Squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón and silenced the shore batteries at Manila, with the loss of only one life on the American side from a heart attack.

===Philippines===
In the early stages of the Spanish-American War in the Philippines, Dewey and the Americans were aided by the Filipino nationalists led by Emilio Aguinaldo who had fought previously the Philippine Revolution and were attacking the Spanish by land after Dewey had defeated the Spanish at sea. There were no U.S. Army ground troops in the Philippines at the time. Dewey and Aguinaldo at first enjoyed a cordial relationship, and Dewey wrote that the Filipinos were &quot;intelligent&quot; and well &quot;capable of self-government.&quot; In August after ground troops arrived, Dewey aided U.S. Army General Wesley Merritt in taking possession of Manila on August 13, 1898, during the 1898 Battle of Manila, the &quot;mock Battle of Manila&quot;, while Aguinaldo&#x27;s troops, surrounding Manila, were kept out. In February 1899, the Philippine–American War started. In 1902, Dewey testified during the Lodge Committee&#x27;s investigation into alleged American war crimes against Filipinos. There, Dewey seemingly reversed his previous positions, stating that &quot;neither the Filipinos nor the Cubans are capable of self-government&quot; and the Philippines would &quot;lapse into anarchy&quot; if the United States granted them full independence. Despite the clear difference between his testimony and his earlier statements, Dewey stated that his testimony reflected the opinions he always held.

==Hero==

Dewey was promoted to rear admiral in May 1898, and full admiral the following year. Returning to the United States on September 27, 1899, Dewey received a hero&#x27;s welcome. New York City&#x27;s September 1899 welcome-home celebration for Dewey was a two-day parade. When Boston paid tribute, he was greeted at City Hall by 280 singers from the Handel and Haydn Society who sang the anthem &quot;See the Conquering Hero Comes&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot;. By act of Congress, he was promoted to the special rank of Admiral of the Navy in 1903, with his date of rank retroactive to 1899.

A special military decoration, the Battle of Manila Bay Medal (commonly called the Dewey Medal), was struck in honor of Dewey&#x27;s victory at Manila Bay. It was awarded to every American officer, sailor, and Marine present at the battle. The medals were designed by Daniel Chester French, sculptor of the Lincoln Memorial, and produced by Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York. Each medal was engraved with the recipient&#x27;s name, rank, and ship. Since his own image appeared on the obverse of the medal, out of modesty, Dewey wore his medal reversed. Dewey was one of only four Americans in history (the other three being Admiral William T. Sampson, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and General John J. Pershing) who were entitled to wear a US government-issued medal with their own image on it. Such was his high regard by the public that &quot;Dewey&quot; was the 19th most popular boys&#x27; name in 1898, jumping from 111th the year prior.

Shortly after the Battle of Manila Bay, on May 31, 1898, Dewey wrote to the Secretary of the Navy asking that 50 Chinese sailors who had served with the Asiatic Squadron at Manila Bay be allowed to enter the United States. In Dewey&#x27;s letter he noted that the Chinese had &quot;rendered the most efficient services upon that occasion&quot; and that they had &quot;shown courage and energy in the face of an enemy.&quot; At that time an immigration law, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibited Chinese laborers from landing in the United States. Dewey had enlisted the Chinese sailors against the wishes of the Navy Department and, despite his very public entreatment that they be granted US citizenship, Congress refused to even take up the issue.

On October 3, 1899, Dewey was presented a special sword by President McKinley in a ceremony at the Capitol building. The presentation of the sword was followed by a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Congress, by unanimous vote, had authorized $10,000 to fund the gift shortly after the Battle of Manila Bay. The elaborately decorated sword was custom-made by Tiffany &amp; Co. Its hilt and fittings were made of 22 carat gold. The sword is now on display, along with uniforms and medals belonging to Admiral Dewey, at the National Museum of the United States Navy at the Washington Navy Yard.

==Politics==
Many suggested Dewey run for President on the Democratic ticket in 1900. His candidacy was plagued by public relations missteps. He was quoted as saying the job of president would be easy since the chief executive was merely following orders in executing the laws enacted by Congress and that he would &quot;execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I have always executed the orders of my superiors.&quot; He admitted to never having voted in a presidential election. He drew yet more criticism when he offhandedly, but prophetically, told a newspaper reporter that: &quot;Our next war will be with Germany.&quot; Dewey also angered some Protestants by marrying a Catholic and giving her the house that the nation had given him following the war. Dewey withdrew from the race in mid-May 1900 and endorsed William McKinley.

In 1900, after his withdrawal from the presidential race, he was named president of the newly established General Board of the Navy Department, which was the Navy&#x27;s major policymaking body. He remained in active naval service on the board until his death, and played a major role in championing the introduction of new technologies into the expanding U.S. Navy with his support of the development of naval aviation and the submarine.

==Marriages and death==

In 1866, Dewey was assigned to duty in the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, and there met the woman who became his first wife: Susan &quot;Susie&quot; Boardman Goodwin (1844–1872), daughter of New Hampshire&#x27;s war governor, Ichabod Goodwin, a Republican who fitted out troops for the war at his own expense. The Deweys were married on October 24, 1867, and had one son, George. Susie died on December 28, 1872, five days after giving birth.

The longtime widower cut a dashing figure and enjoyed the company of women. In 1893, he was escorting two women aboard a warship when he unexpectedly ran into his son. Thinking on his feet, Dewey introduced his son as his younger brother.

On November 9, 1899, after his triumphal return from the Far East, Dewey was married for the second time to Mildred McLean Hazen (1850–1931), widow of General William Babcock Hazen, in the rectory of St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. Since Hazen was a Roman Catholic and Dewey was not, they were not permitted to have their wedding inside a Catholic church. The marriage was criticized by some anti-Catholic voices, as was Dewey&#x27;s transfer to his wife of the $50,000 Washington mansion given to him by the American public through a fund-raising campaign.

In later life, Dewey wore stylish clothes and a handlebar mustache, which was his trademark. His inherited wealth allowed him to live in comfort. He often went horseback riding with President Theodore Roosevelt in Washington&#x27;s Rock Creek Park, and he was a fellow member of Washington&#x27;s prestigious Metropolitan Club.

For the last 17 years of his life, he resided at 1730 K Street NW, in Washington. His office was in the State, War and Navy Building adjacent to the White House.

Dewey died in Washington on January 16, 1917. After lying in state at the United States Capitol rotunda, his remains were interred at Arlington National Cemetery. A mausoleum was later built for him in the cemetery. In 1925, his widow had his remains transferred to the Bethlehem Chapel, on the crypt level, at the Washington National Cathedral, Washington, D.C.

==Memberships==

Admiral Dewey belonged to numerous military, patriotic and hereditary societies.

In 1901, Admiral Dewey was elected as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

In 1882, Dewey was elected as a First Class Companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) and was assigned insignia number 2397.

Dewey was a key leader in the Naval Order of the United States (insignia number 207). He served as Commander of the New York Commandery of the Naval Order of the United States from 1898 to 1900, and as Commander General (i.e., National President) of the Order from 1907 to 1917.

He was also a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Order of the Founders and Patriots of America (state member number 93 and national member number 552) and served as Governor General from 1904 to 1906 and from 1906 to 1908, the New York Society of the Sons of the Revolution (elected as a life member in 1899), the Vermont Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (joined in 1892, state member number 220 and national member number 2920), the Vermont Society of Colonial Wars (insignia number 2663), the New Jersey Society of the General Society of the War of 1812 (state membership number 15), the Society of American Wars (Vice Commander General), and the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars (insignia number 363).

Dewey&#x27;s membership insignia for most of the societies listed above are in the collection of the National Museum of the United States Navy at the Washington Navy Yard.

Dewey was an early member of the board of directors of the Boy Scouts of America, serving until his resignation from that office in late 1910.

==Dates of rank==
* Acting Midshipman, United States Naval Academy: September 23, 1854
* Warranted Midshipman: June 11, 1858

In the mid to late-18th Century, the US Navy had three &quot;ranks&quot; of Midshipmen serving: &quot;acting midshipmen&quot; who were active students at the US Naval Academy, &quot;warranted midshipmen&quot; who had completed most of their studies at the Academy and were serving at sea while holding line authority through a warrant of authority, and &quot;passed midshipmen&quot; who had completed all requirements for commissioning and held warranted line authority similar to ensigns of the modern US Navy. In the era of the Civil War, it was a common practice for officers to serve as a &quot;Master&quot; with a warrant of authority until they were commissioned. It was also common for officers to be granted shipboard commissions based on the need to fill certain jobs or billets. Dewey was therefore made a lieutenant once he &quot;signed on&quot; with David Farragut. He never held the ranks of ensign or lieutenant (junior grade) as those ranks were not created until 1862 and 1883, respectively. Nor was he appointed to the rank of vice admiral, there being no actively serving vice admirals in the US Navy at that time.


Admiral Dewey&#x27;s final rank was Admiral of the Navy, making him the highest-ranking officer in the history of the United States Navy. He is the only person ever to hold this rank. Admiral of the Navy is equivalent to General of the Armies. General John J. Pershing, US Army, was promoted to General of the Armies in 1919, Lieutenant General George Washington, US Army, was posthumously promoted on the Retired List of the US Army to the rank of General of the Armies of the United States, with an effective date of rank of July 4, 1776, and General Ulysses S. Grant also received a posthumous promotion on December 27, 2022.
Admiral Dewey served a total of 62 years on active duty in the U.S. Navy. This was just one year less than Admiral Hyman G. Rickover.

==Honors==

===Medals awarded by the U.S. government===

(Dates indicate the year the medal was awarded.)

*Civil War Campaign Medal (1908)
*Battle of Manila Bay Medal (aka. &quot;Dewey Medal&quot;) (1899)
*Spanish Campaign Medal (1908)
*Philippine Campaign Medal (1908)

Note – Although Dewey was entitled to all of the above medals, he is pictured at right wearing only the Battle of Manila Bay Medal. He wore the medal with the reverse side showing because his profile was on the obverse side. (He was one of only four officers in American military history entitled to wear a medal with his own image on it.) He is wearing the special additional gold braid on his sleeves denoting his unique rank as Admiral of the Navy.

<doc id="146879" wikidata="Q1036696" url="?curid=146879" title="Hypothermia">
<text>Hypothermia is defined as a body core temperature below in humans. Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia, there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia, shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be hallucinations and paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes their clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping.
Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to cold weather and cold water immersion. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly, this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia and advanced age. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of through thermoregulation. Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person&#x27;s symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person&#x27;s core temperature.
The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and voluntary physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person&#x27;s temperature is greater than . If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12 millimoles per litre at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued.
Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States. It is more common in older people and males. One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is in a 2-year-old boy from Poland named Adam. Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described. In individuals for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%. Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars.

The term is from Greek ῠ̔πο (ypo), meaning &quot;under&quot;, and θέρμη (&quot;thérmē&quot;), meaning &quot;heat&quot;. The opposite of hypothermia is hyperthermia, an increased body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.

==Classification==
Hypothermia is often defined as any body temperature below . With this method it is divided into degrees of severity based on the core temperature.

Another classification system, the Swiss staging system, divides hypothermia based on the presenting symptoms which is preferred when it is not possible to determine an accurate core temperature.

Other cold-related injuries that can be present either alone or in combination with hypothermia include:

*Chilblains: condition caused by repeated exposure of skin to temperatures just above freezing. The cold causes damage to small blood vessels in the skin. This damage is permanent and the redness and itching will return with additional exposure. The redness and itching typically occurs on cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes.
*Frostbite: the freezing and destruction of tissue, which happens below the freezing point of water
*Frostnip: a superficial cooling of tissues without cellular destruction
*Trench foot or immersion foot: a condition caused by repetitive exposure to water at non-freezing temperatures

The normal human body temperature is often stated as . Hyperthermia and fevers are defined as a temperature of greater than .

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the degree of hypothermia, and may be divided by the three stages of severity. People with hypothermia may appear pale and feel cold to touch.
Infants with hypothermia may feel cold when touched, with bright red skin and an unusual lack of energy.

Behavioural changes such as impaired judgement, impaired sense of time and place, unusual aggression and numbness can be observed in individuals with hypothermia; they can also deny their condition and refuse any help. A hypothermic person can be euphoric and hallucinating.

Cold stress refers to a near-normal body temperature with low skin temperature; signs include shivering. Cold stress is caused by cold exposure and it can lead to hypothermia and frostbite if not treated.

===Mild===
Symptoms of mild hypothermia may be vague, with sympathetic nervous system excitation (shivering, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, and contraction of blood vessels). These are all physiological responses to preserve heat. Increased urine production due to cold, mental confusion, and liver dysfunction may also be present. Hyperglycemia may be present, as glucose consumption by cells and insulin secretion both decrease, and tissue sensitivity to insulin may be blunted. Sympathetic activation also releases glucose from the liver. In many cases, however, especially in people with alcoholic intoxication, hypoglycemia appears to be a more common cause. Hypoglycemia is also found in many people with hypothermia, as hypothermia may be a result of hypoglycemia.

===Moderate===
As hypothermia progresses, symptoms include: mental status changes such as amnesia, confusion, slurred speech, decreased reflexes, and loss of fine motor skills.

===Severe===
As the temperature decreases, further physiological systems falter and heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure all decrease. This results in an expected heart rate in the 30s at a temperature of .

There is often cold, inflamed skin, hallucinations, lack of reflexes, fixed dilated pupils, low blood pressure, pulmonary edema, and shivering is often absent. Pulse and respiration rates decrease significantly, but fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can also occur. Atrial fibrillation is not typically a concern in and of itself.

=== Paradoxical undressing ===
Twenty to fifty percent of hypothermia deaths are associated with paradoxical undressing. This typically occurs during moderate and severe hypothermia, as the person becomes disoriented, confused, and combative. They may begin discarding their clothing, which, in turn, increases the rate of heat loss.

Rescuers who are trained in mountain survival techniques are taught to expect this; however, people who die from hypothermia in urban environments who are found in an undressed state are sometimes incorrectly assumed to have been subjected to sexual assault.

One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body temperature. Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted (known as a loss of vasomotor tone) and relax, leading to a sudden surge of blood (and heat) to the extremities, causing the person to feel overheated.

===Terminal burrowing===
An apparent self-protective behaviour, known as &quot;terminal burrowing&quot;, or &quot;hide-and-die syndrome&quot;, occurs in the final stages of hypothermia. Those affected will enter small, enclosed spaces, such as underneath beds or behind wardrobes. It is often associated with paradoxical undressing. Researchers in Germany claim this is &quot;obviously an autonomous process of the brain stem, which is triggered in the final state of hypothermia and produces a primitive and burrowing-like behavior of protection, as seen in hibernating mammals&quot;. This happens mostly in cases where temperature drops slowly.

==Causes==

Hypothermia usually occurs from exposure to low temperatures, and is frequently complicated by alcohol consumption. Any condition that decreases heat production, increases heat loss, or impairs thermoregulation, however, may contribute. Thus, hypothermia risk factors include: substance use disorders (including alcohol use disorder), homelessness, any condition that affects judgment (such as hypoglycemia), the extremes of age, poor clothing, chronic medical conditions (such as hypothyroidism and sepsis), and living in a cold environment. Hypothermia occurs frequently in major trauma, and is also observed in severe cases of anorexia nervosa. Hypothermia is also associated with worse outcomes in people with sepsiswhile most people with sepsis develop fevers (elevated body temperature), some develop hypothermia.

In urban areas, hypothermia frequently occurs with chronic cold exposure, such as in cases of homelessness, as well as with immersion accidents involving drugs, alcohol or mental illness. While studies have shown that people experiencing homelessness are at risk of premature death from hypothermia, the true incidence of hypothermia-related deaths in this population is difficult to determine. In more rural environments, the incidence of hypothermia is higher among people with significant comorbidities and less ability to move independently. With rising interest in wilderness exploration, and outdoor and water sports, the incidence of hypothermia secondary to accidental exposure may become more frequent in the general population.

===Alcohol===
Alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypothermia in two ways: vasodilation and temperature controlling systems in the brain. Vasodilation increases blood flow to the skin, resulting in heat being lost to the environment. This produces the effect of feeling warm, when one is actually losing heat. Alcohol also affects the temperature-regulating system in the brain, decreasing the body&#x27;s ability to shiver and use energy that would normally aid the body in generating heat. The overall effects of alcohol lead to a decrease in body temperature and a decreased ability to generate body heat in response to cold environments. Alcohol is a common risk factor for death due to hypothermia. Between 33% and 73% of hypothermia cases are complicated by alcohol.

===Water immersion===
Hypothermia continues to be a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently increases the risk of other injuries.

Other factors predisposing to immersion hypothermia include dehydration, inadequate rewarming between repetitive dives, starting a dive while wearing cold, wet dry suit undergarments, sweating with work, inadequate thermal insulation, and poor physical conditioning.

Heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air. Thus, water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in survivors, although this is not usually the direct clinical cause of death for those who are not rescued. A water temperature of can lead to death in as little as one hour, and water temperatures near freezing can cause death in as little as 15 minutes. During the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, most people who entered the water died in 15–30 minutes.

The actual cause of death in cold water is usually the bodily reactions to heat loss and to freezing water, rather than hypothermia (loss of core temperature) itself. For example, plunged into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within two minutes from cold shock (uncontrolled rapid breathing, and gasping, causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic); another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from cold incapacitation: inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body &quot;protectively&quot; shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core. Exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time.

==Pathophysiology==

Heat is primarily generated in muscle tissue, including the heart, and in the liver, while it is lost through the skin (90%) and lungs (10%). Heat production may be increased (to over 1200 W in trained endurance athletes) through muscle contractions (i.e. exercise and shivering). The rate of heat loss is determined, as with any object, by convection, conduction, and radiation. The rates of these can be affected by body mass index, body surface area to volume ratios, clothing and other environmental conditions.

Many changes to physiology occur as body temperatures decrease. These occur in the cardiovascular system leading to the Osborn J wave and other dysrhythmias, decreased central nervous system electrical activity, cold diuresis, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Research has shown that glomerular filtration rates (GFR) decrease as a result of hypothermia. In essence, hypothermia increases preglomerular vasoconstriction, thus decreasing both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR.

==Diagnosis==
Accurate determination of core temperature often requires a special low temperature thermometer, as most clinical thermometers do not measure accurately below . A low temperature thermometer can be placed in the rectum, esophagus or bladder. Esophageal measurements are the most accurate and are recommended once a person is intubated. Other methods of measurement such as in the mouth, under the arm, or using an infrared ear thermometer are often not accurate.

As a hypothermic person&#x27;s heart rate may be very slow, prolonged feeling for a pulse could be required before detecting. In 2005, the American Heart Association recommended at least 30–45 seconds to verify the absence of a pulse before initiating CPR. Others recommend a 60-second check.

The classical ECG finding of hypothermia is the Osborn J wave. Also, ventricular fibrillation frequently occurs below and asystole below . The Osborn J may look very similar to those of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. Thrombolysis as a reaction to the presence of Osborn J waves is not indicated, as it would only worsen the underlying coagulopathy caused by hypothermia.

== Prevention ==
Staying dry and wearing proper clothing help to prevent hypothermia. Synthetic and wool fabrics are superior to cotton as they provide better insulation when wet and dry. Some synthetic fabrics, such as polypropylene and polyester, are used in clothing designed to wick perspiration away from the body, such as liner socks and moisture-wicking undergarments. Clothing should be loose fitting, as tight clothing reduces the circulation of warm blood. In planning outdoor activity, prepare appropriately for possible cold weather. Those who drink alcohol before or during outdoor activity should ensure at least one sober person responsible for safety is present.

Covering the head is effective, but no more effective than covering any other part of the body. While common folklore says that people lose most of their heat through their heads, heat loss from the head is no more significant than that from other uncovered parts of the body. However, heat loss from the head is significant in infants, whose head is larger relative to the rest of the body than in adults. Several studies have shown that for uncovered infants, lined hats significantly reduce heat loss and thermal stress. Children have a larger surface area per unit mass, and other things being equal should have one more layer of clothing than adults in similar conditions, and the time they spend in cold environments should be limited. However, children are often more active than adults, and may generate more heat. In both adults and children, overexertion causes sweating and thus increases heat loss.

Building a shelter can aid survival where there is danger of death from exposure. Shelters can be constructed out of a variety of materials. Metal can conduct heat away from the occupants and is sometimes best avoided. The shelter should not be too big so body warmth stays near the occupants. Good ventilation is essential especially if a fire will be lit in the shelter. Fires should be put out before the occupants sleep to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. People caught in very cold, snowy conditions can build an igloo or snow cave to shelter.

The United States Coast Guard promotes using life vests to protect against hypothermia through the 50/50/50 rule: If someone is in water for 50 minutes, they have a 50 percent better chance of survival if they are wearing a life jacket. A heat escape lessening position can be used to increase survival in cold water.

Babies should sleep at and housebound people should be checked regularly to make sure the temperature of the home is at least .

==Management==

Aggressiveness of treatment is matched to the degree of hypothermia. Treatment ranges from noninvasive, passive external warming to active external rewarming, to active core rewarming. In severe cases resuscitation begins with simultaneous removal from the cold environment and management of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Rapid rewarming is then commenced. Moving the person as little and as gently as possible is recommended as aggressive handling may increase risks of a dysrhythmia.

Hypoglycemia is a frequent complication and needs to be tested for and treated. Intravenous thiamine and glucose is often recommended, as many causes of hypothermia are complicated by Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy.

The UK National Health Service advises against putting a person in a hot bath, massaging their arms and legs, using a heating pad, or giving them alcohol. These measures can cause a rapid fall in blood pressure and potential cardiac arrest.

===Rewarming===
Rewarming can be done with a number of methods including passive external rewarming, active external rewarming, and active internal rewarming. Passive external rewarming involves the use of a person&#x27;s own ability to generate heat by providing properly insulated dry clothing and moving to a warm environment. Passive external rewarming is recommended for those with mild hypothermia.

Active external rewarming involves applying warming devices externally, such as a heating blanket. These may function by warmed forced air (Bair Hugger is a commonly used device), chemical reactions, or electricity. In wilderness environments, hypothermia may be helped by placing hot water bottles in both armpits and in the groin. Active external rewarming is recommended for moderate hypothermia. Active core rewarming involves the use of intravenous warmed fluids, irrigation of body cavities with warmed fluids (the chest or abdomen), use of warm humidified inhaled air, or use of extracorporeal rewarming such as via a heart lung machine or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Extracorporeal rewarming is the fastest method for those with severe hypothermia. When severe hypothermia has led to cardiac arrest, effective extracorporeal warming results in survival with normal mental function about 50% of the time. Chest irrigation is recommended if bypass or ECMO is not possible.

Rewarming shock (or rewarming collapse) is a sudden drop in blood pressure in combination with a low cardiac output which may occur during active treatment of a severely hypothermic person. There was a theoretical concern that external rewarming rather than internal rewarming may increase the risk. These concerns were partly believed to be due to afterdrop, a situation detected during laboratory experiments where there is a continued decrease in core temperature after rewarming has been started. Recent studies have not supported these concerns, and problems are not found with active external rewarming.

===Fluids===

For people who are alert and able to swallow, drinking warm (not hot) sweetened liquids can help raise the temperature. General medical consensus advises against alcohol and caffeinated drinks. As most hypothermic people are moderately dehydrated due to cold-induced diuresis, warmed intravenous fluids to a temperature of are often recommended.

=== Cardiac arrest ===
In those without signs of life, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be continued during active rewarming. For ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, a single defibrillation should be attempted. However, people with severe hypothermia may not respond to pacing or defibrillation. It is not known if further defibrillation should be withheld until the core temperature reaches . In Europe, epinephrine is not recommended until the person&#x27;s core temperature reaches , while the American Heart Association recommends up to three doses of epinephrine before a core temperature of is reached. Once a temperature of has been reached, normal ACLS protocols should be followed.

==Prognosis==
It is usually recommended not to declare a person dead until their body is warmed to a near normal body temperature of greater than , since extreme hypothermia can suppress heart and brain function. This is summarized in the common saying &quot;You&#x27;re not dead until you&#x27;re warm and dead.&quot; Exceptions include if there are obvious fatal injuries or the chest is frozen so that it cannot be compressed. If a person was buried in an avalanche for more than 35 minutes and is found with a mouth packed full of snow without a pulse, stopping early may also be reasonable. This is also the case if a person&#x27;s blood potassium is greater than 12 mmol/L.

Those who are stiff with pupils that do not move may survive if treated aggressively. Survival with good function also occasionally occurs even after the need for hours of CPR. Children who have near-drowning accidents in water near can occasionally be revived, even over an hour after losing consciousness. The cold water lowers the metabolism, allowing the brain to withstand a much longer period of hypoxia. While survival is possible, mortality from severe or profound hypothermia remains high despite optimal treatment. Studies estimate mortality at between 38% and 75%.

In those who have hypothermia due to another underlying health problem, when death occurs it is frequently from that underlying health problem.

==Epidemiology==
Between 1995 and 2004 in the United States, an average of 1,560 cold-related emergency department visits occurred per year and in the years 1999 to 2004, an average of 647 people died per year due to hypothermia. Of deaths reported between 1999 and 2002 in the US, 49% of those affected were 65 years or older and two-thirds were male. Most deaths were not work related (63%) and 23% of affected people were at home. Hypothermia was most common during the autumn and winter months of October through March. In the United Kingdom, an estimated 300 deaths per year are due to hypothermia, whereas the annual incidence of hypothermia-related deaths in Canada is 8,000.

== History ==
Hypothermia has played a major role in the success or failure of many military campaigns, from Hannibal&#x27;s loss of nearly half his men in the Second Punic War (218 B.C.) to the near destruction of Napoleon&#x27;s armies in Russia in 1812. Men wandered around confused by hypothermia, some lost consciousness and died, others shivered, later developed torpor, and tended to sleep. Others too weak to walk fell on their knees; some stayed that way for some time resisting death. The pulse of some was weak and hard to detect; others groaned; yet others had eyes open and wild with quiet delirium. Deaths from hypothermia in Russian regions continued through the first and second world wars, especially on the Eastern Front in battles such as the Battle of Moscow and the Battle of Stalingrad where German soldiers were not provided with winter clothing.

Civilian examples of deaths caused by hypothermia occurred during the sinkings of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; and RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and more recently of the MS &quot;Estonia&quot;.

Antarctic explorers developed hypothermia; Ernest Shackleton and his team measured body temperatures &quot;below 94.2°, which spells death at home&quot;, though this probably referred to oral temperatures rather than core temperature and corresponded to mild hypothermia. One of Scott&#x27;s team, Atkinson, became confused through hypothermia.

Nazi human experimentation during World War II amounting to medical torture included hypothermia experiments, which killed many victims. There were 360 to 400 experiments and 280 to 300 subjects, indicating some had more than one experiment performed on them. Various methods of rewarming were attempted: &quot;One assistant later testified that some victims were thrown into boiling water for rewarming&quot;.

In 2024, at least six babies in Gaza died of hypothermia under the harsh rain and cold, which they had to endure in flimsy camps due to the bombing of their homes and forced displacement inflicted upon them by the IDF. Three of the babies died in the coastal zone of Al-Mawasi, which there families had been forced to evacuate to, given its designation as &quot;safe zone&quot;.

==Medical use==

Various degrees of hypothermia may be deliberately induced in medicine for purposes of treatment of brain injury, or lowering metabolism so that total brain ischemia can be tolerated for a short time. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is a medical technique in which the brain is cooled as low as 10 °C, which allows the heart to be stopped and blood pressure to be lowered to zero, for the treatment of aneurysms and other circulatory problems that do not tolerate arterial pressure or blood flow. The time limit for this technique, as also for accidental arrest in ice water (which internal temperatures may drop to as low as 15 °C), is about one hour.

==Other animals==
Hypothermia can happen in most mammals in cold weather and can be fatal. Baby mammals such as kittens are unable to regulate their body temperatures and have a risk of hypothermia if they are not kept warm by their mothers.

Many animals other than humans often induce hypothermia during hibernation or torpor.

Water bears (Tardigrade), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive freezing at low temperatures by replacing most of their internal water with the sugar trehalose, preventing the crystallization that otherwise damages cell membranes.

<text>Treasure (from from Greek &quot;thēsauros&quot;, &quot;treasure store&quot;) is a concentration of wealth — often originating from ancient history — that is considered lost and/or forgotten until rediscovered. Some jurisdictions legally define what constitutes treasure, such as in the British Treasure Act 1996.

The phrase &quot;blood and treasure&quot; has been used to refer to the human and monetary costs associated with massive endeavours such as war that expend both.

Searching for hidden treasure is a common theme in legend; treasure hunters do exist, and can seek lost wealth for a living.

== Burial ==

Buried treasure is an important part of the popular mythos surrounding pirates. According to popular conception, pirates often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return for them later (often with the use of treasure maps).

There are three well-known stories that helped popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure: &quot;Wolfert Webber&quot; (1824) by Washington Irving, &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843) by Edgar Allan Poe, and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson. They differ widely in plot and literary treatment but all are derived from the William Kidd legend. Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was directly influenced by Irving&#x27;s &quot;Wolfert Webber&quot;, Stevenson saying in his preface &quot;It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther.. the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters.. were the property of Washington Irving.&quot;
Although buried pirate treasure is a favorite literary theme, there are very few documented cases of pirates actually burying treasure, and no documented cases of a historical pirate treasure map. One documented case of buried treasure involved Francis Drake who buried Spanish gold and silver after raiding the train at Nombre de Dios—after Drake went to find his ships, he returned six hours later and retrieved the loot and sailed for England. Drake did not create a map.

The pirate most responsible for the legends of buried pirate treasure was Captain Kidd. The story was that Kidd buried treasure from the plundered ship the Quedah Merchant on Gardiners Island, near Long Island, New York, before being arrested and returned to England, where he was put through a very public trial and executed. Although much of Kidd&#x27;s treasure was recovered from various people who had taken possession of it before Kidd&#x27;s arrest (such as his wife and various others who were given it for safe keeping), there was so much public interest and fascination with the case at the time that speculation grew that a vast fortune remained and that Kidd had secretly buried it. Captain Kidd did bury a small cache of treasure on Gardiner&#x27;s Island in a spot known as Cherry Tree Field; however, it was removed by Governor Bellomont and sent to England to be used as evidence against him. Over the years, many people have tried to find the supposed remnants of Kidd&#x27;s treasure on Gardiner&#x27;s Island and elsewhere, but none has ever been found.

== Maps ==
A treasure map is a variation of a map to mark the location of buried treasure, a lost mine, a valuable secret or a hidden location. One of the earliest known instances of a document listing buried treasure is the copper scroll, which was recovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls near Qumran in 1952. More common in fiction than in reality, &quot;pirate treasure maps&quot; are often depicted in works of fiction as hand drawn and containing arcane clues for the characters to follow.

Treasure maps have taken on numerous permutations in literature and film, such as the stereotypical tattered chart with an oversized &quot;X&quot; (as in &quot;X marks the spot&quot;) to denote the treasure&#x27;s location, first made popular by Robert Louis Stevenson in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883) or a cryptic puzzle (in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843)).

<text>Violent Femmes is the debut album by Violent Femmes. Mostly recorded in July 1982, the album was released by Slash Records on vinyl and on cassette in April 1983, and on CD in 1987, with two extra tracks, &quot;Ugly&quot; and &quot;Gimme the Car&quot;.

In 2002, Rhino Records remastered the album, filled out the disc&#x27;s length with demos and added another disc of live tracks and a radio interview for a 20th anniversary special edition, with liner notes by Michael Azerrad.

&quot;Violent Femmes&quot; is the band&#x27;s most successful album to date. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold four years after its release and platinum four years after that, despite it never having appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. After achieving platinum certification on February 1, 1991, the album finally charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the first time on August 3, 1991, and peaked at number 171. Since Nielsen Music began electronically tracking sales in 1991, the album has sold 1.8 million copies. Blending RIAA certifications and Nielsen Music sales data, the record&#x27;s American sales were estimated at three million as of 2016.

==Background==
Most of the songs on &quot;Violent Femmes&quot; and its follow-up were written when songwriter Gordon Gano was an 18-year-old high-school student in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The album was recorded at Castle Recording Studios in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin in July 1982. It was self-funded before they had signed with their record label, Slash. Gano said, &quot;It was a strange situation because we hadn&#x27;t met anyone from Slash or been to Los Angeles when we signed with them. The good thing was because we recorded the album first, it was exactly the way we wanted. There was no executive influence.&quot;

==Cover==
The cover model is Billie Jo Campbell, a three-year-old girl who was walking down a Los Angeles street when she and her mother were approached and offered $100 for the photograph that became the album cover. The photograph depicts Campbell peering into the window of a house in Laurel Canyon. Campbell recollects: &quot;I remember looking into that building, and they kept telling me there were animals in there, and I was pissed off ... I didn&#x27;t know why they were making me look in this building. I had no idea there were photographers there. I was ... pissed off that I couldn&#x27;t see the animals and I was all cranky by the end of it.&quot;

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, J. D. Considine wrote that &quot;Violent Femmes&quot; was precocious yet dynamic, with a good balance between Gano&#x27;s direct lyrics and the full sound of the music. Robert Christgau of &quot;the Village Voice&quot; compared Gano to Jonathan Richman of the Modern Lovers. Gano himself grew tired of comparisons to Richman, as by his own account he was actually trying to sound like Steve Wynn of the Dream Syndicate.

In a retrospective write-up for AllMusic, Steve Huey called &quot;Violent Femmes&quot; &quot;one of the most distinctive records of the early alternative movement and an enduring cult classic,&quot; noting that &quot;the music also owes something to the Modern Lovers&#x27; minimalism, but powered by Brian Ritchie&#x27;s busy acoustic bass riffing and the urgency and wild abandon of punk rock, the Femmes forged a sound all their own,&quot; while crediting Gano for keeping &quot;the music engaging and compelling without overindulging in his seemingly willful naiveté.&quot;

&quot;Violent Femmes&quot; has been included in lists of the best albums of the 1980s by publications such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who in a 2002 list ranked it 36th, and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, who in a 2012 list ranked it 21st. In 2014, &quot;PopMatters&quot; listed &quot;Violent Femmes&quot; as an essential alternative rock album of the 1980s. It also placed at number 974 in the 2000 edition of the book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, and was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="146885" wikidata="Q1648625" url="?curid=146885" title="Funkadelic (album)">
<text>Funkadelic is the debut album by the American funk rock band Funkadelic, released in 1970 on Westbound Records.

==Background==
The group that would become Funkadelic was formed by George Clinton in 1964, as the unnamed backing section for his doo wop group The Parliaments. Funkadelic signed to Westbound in 1968. Around this time, the group&#x27;s music evolved from soul and doo wop into a harder guitar-driven mix of psychedelic rock, soul and funk, much influenced by the popular musical (and political) movements of the time. Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, The MC5, and Vanilla Fudge were major inspirations. The band made their first live television performance on &quot;Say Brother&quot; on October 7, 1969. They played a jam with songs &quot;Into My Own Thing&quot; (a Sly Stone cover), &quot;What Is Soul?&quot;, &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot;, &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot; (a Stevie Wonder cover), &quot;Friday Night, August 14th&quot; and &quot;Music for My Mother&quot;.

On the group&#x27;s self-titled debut, the credits listed organist Mickey Atkins plus Clinton, Tiki Fulwood, Eddie Hazel, Billy &quot;Bass&quot; Nelson, and Tawl Ross. The recording also included the rest of the Parliaments singers (still uncredited because of contractual concerns), several uncredited session musicians then employed by Motown, as well as Ray Monette (of Rare Earth).

== Reception and legacy ==
In conjunction with the release of &quot;Funkadelic&quot;, Westbound Records circulated a promotional single called &quot;Focus on Funkadelic&quot; to radio stations. The single features six snippets of tracks from the LP.

According to critic Robert Christgau, &quot;Funkadelic&quot;″s &quot;dark, slow, tuneless&quot; music was originally panned and &quot;scared the bejesus out of fans of upful blackness on both sides of America&#x27;s widening racial divide&quot;. Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau jokingly referred to Clinton as &quot;someone from Carolina who encountered eternity on LSD and vowed to contain it in a groove.&quot; Years later, Christgau rated the album as &quot;a prequel to Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s depressive &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; later hailed &quot;Funkadelic&quot; as &quot;the best blues-influenced, warped acid rock you&#x27;re likely to hear&quot;, and &quot;The Mojo Collection&quot; (2007) called it the band&#x27;s first album of &quot;spaced-out psychedelic funk&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier said the recordings are &quot;essentially conventional soul songs in the spirit of Motown or Stax -- steady rhythms, dense arrangements, choruses of vocals -- but with a loud, overdriven, fuzzy guitar lurking high in the mix&quot;. He deemed the album &quot;a revealing and unique record that&#x27;s certainly not short on significance, clearly marking the crossroads between &#x27;60s soul and &#x27;70s funk&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;ll Bet You&quot; was later covered by The Jackson 5 on their album &quot;ABC&quot;, and sampled by the Beastie Boys for their song &quot;Car Thief&quot;. The 2005 CD reissue also contains their version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Shake It Loose&quot;, which was recorded two years prior by Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes on their album &quot;Love Child&quot;. In more recent years, The Red Hot Chili Peppers have combined the main riff of &quot;Mommy, What&#x27;s a Funkadelic?&quot; and certain parts of the lyrics from &quot;What Is Soul?&quot; in live shows, a version which appears as a B-Side on their 2002 single &quot;By the Way&quot;.

==Singles==
I&#x27;ll Bet You got to No. 22 on the US Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody&#x27;s Got a Thing also reached No. 30 on the US Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.

<text>Upper Austria ( ; ; ) is one of the nine states or of Austria. Its capital is Linz. Upper Austria borders Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as the other Austrian states of Lower Austria, Styria, and Salzburg. With an area of and 1.49 million inhabitants, Upper Austria is the fourth-largest Austrian state by land area and the third-largest by population.

==History==
===Origins===
For a long period of the Middle Ages, much of what would become Upper Austria constituted Traungau, a region of the Duchy of Bavaria. In the mid-13th century, it became known as the Principality above the Enns River (&quot;&quot;), this name being first recorded in 1264. (At the time, the term &quot;Upper Austria&quot; also included Tyrol and various scattered Habsburg possessions in southern Germany.)

===Early modern era===
In 1490, the area was given a measure of independence within the Holy Roman Empire, with the status of a principality. By 1550, there was a Protestant majority. In 1564, Upper Austria, together with Lower Austria and the Bohemian territories, fell under Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II.

At the start of the 17th century, the Counter-Reformation was instituted under Emperor Rudolf II and his successor Matthias. After a military campaign, the area was under the control of Bavaria for some years in the early 17th century.

The Innviertel was ceded from the Electorate of Bavaria to Upper Austria in the Treaty of Teschen in 1779. During the Napoleonic Wars, Upper Austria was occupied by the French army on more than one occasion.

== 20th century ==

In 1918 after the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the name &quot;Oberösterreich&quot; was used to describe the province of the new Austria. After Austria was annexed by Adolf Hitler, the Nazi dictator, who had been born in the Upper Austrian town of Braunau am Inn and raised in Upper Austria, Upper Austria became Reichsgau Oberdonau, although this also included the southern part of the Sudetenland, annexed from Czechoslovakia, and a small part of Styria. In 1945, Upper Austria was partitioned between the American zone to the south and the Soviet zone to the north.

== Industry ==
Today Upper Austria is Austria&#x27;s leading industrial region. As of 2009, it accounted for approximately a quarter of the country&#x27;s exports.

== Lakes ==
* Ausee
* Gosauseen
* Höllerersee
* Nussensee
* Oedter See
* Pichlinger See
* Puckinger See
* Rosenhofer Teiche

==Demographics==
As of January 1, 2021, 1,495,608 people resided in the state, of which 107,318 (7.17 percent) were European Union/European Economic Area/Switzerland/UK citizens and 96,623 (6.46 percent) were third-country nationals. 

The majority of Upper Austrians are Christian. In 2001, 79.4 percent of the people still belonged to the Roman Catholic church, about 4.4% were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, 4.0 percent were Muslims, and 8.8 percent were of no confession. By the end of 2020, the proportion of Catholics had fallen to 62 percent, while the corresponding proportion of Protestants was about 3.1 percent of the Upper Austrian population.

In the last census in 2021, 73.4% of people were Christians, overwhelmingly Catholic, around 7.4% practiced Islam and 17.3% practiced no faith. By the end of 2022, the proportion of Catholics has decreased to 58.9%, and around 3% of the population were members of Austria’s national Lutheran church. At the end of 2023, a good 800,000 of the 1.53 million inhabitants were Catholic and 43,847 or almost 3% were Protestant.

=== Population development ===
After World War II, Upper Austria received a million refugees. The Soviet and American armies occupied Upper Austria as hundreds of thousands of people fled from both sides of the land front. 

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 65.9 billion € in 2018, accounting for 17.1% of the Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 39,500 € or 131% of the EU27 average in the same year.

==Politics==
The Upper Austrian state constitution defines Upper Austria as an independent state of the democratic Republic of Austria. In its constitution, Upper Austria also declares its support for a united Europe that is committed to democratic, constitutional, social and federal principles as well as the principle of subsidiarity, preserves the autonomy of the regions and ensures their participation in European decision-making. In its regional constitution, Upper Austria defines its position in Europe as an independent, future-oriented and self-confident region that participates in the further development of a united Europe.

Like Styria, Upper Austria is a swing state that usually has a signal character in nationwide elections. The conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party dominates in rural areas, the Social Democratic Party of Austria has its strongholds in the cities of Linz, Wels and Steyr or in the Attnang-Puchheim railroad junction, but the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria has also traditionally had a strong presence, for example in the Innviertel.

==Administrative divisions==
Administratively, the state is divided into 15 districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), three Statutarstädte and 438 municipalities.

===Statutory cities===
#Linz
#Steyr

<doc id="146897" wikidata="Q4863769" url="?curid=146897" title="Barrison Sisters">
<text>The Barrison Sisters were a risqué vaudeville act which performed in the United States and Europe from about 1893 to 1897; in the United States they were advertised as &quot;The Wickedest Girls in the World&quot;.

==Origin==

Lona (Abelone Maria, 1871–1939), Olga (Hansine Johanne, 1875–1908), Sophia (Sofie Kathrine Theodora, 1877–1906), Inger (Inger Marie, 1878–1918), and Gertrude (Gertrud Marie, 1881–1946) Barrison were actual sisters (many &quot;sister&quot; vaudeville acts were not) of Danish-German descent. The five sisters were all born in Copenhagen, Denmark. Along with their mother, the sisters emigrated to the United States in 1886, joining their father, who had earlier made the same journey. 

Lona Barrison, the oldest of the sisters, had a fleeting theatre experience in Copenhagen as a young girl, and it was she who initially gravitated towards the theatre scene after the family settled in Manhattan, New York City. Later on, she was joined by her siblings. Originally called Bareisen, they anglicized their surname, thus becoming the Barrison Sisters. The five blond and curly-haired siblings were said to sing in high squeaky voices and dance with middling ability. They achieved notoriety, however, by ingenious use of double entendres on stage.

Actress Pearl Eytinge initially produced them and wrote a comedietta for them called &quot;Mr Cupid&quot;. Her manager, Danish-born William (Wilhelm Ludvig) Fleron (1858–1935), took over the management of the sisters and married Lona in 1893.

==Most famous act==
In their most famous act, the sisters would dance, raising their skirts slightly above their knees, and ask the audience, &quot;Would you like to see my pussy?&quot; When they had coaxed the audience into an enthusiastic response, they would raise up their skirts, revealing that each sister was wearing underwear of their own manufacture that had a live kitten secured over the crotch.

After their success in Europe in the mid-1890s, scores of troupes purporting to be &quot;sisters&quot; followed in their footsteps, among them the British Machinson Sisters. The Barrison Sisters broke up in 1897, but both Gertrude and Lona went on to have successful solo careers on the stage. Gertrude, the youngest and perhaps most talented of them all, became a groundbreaking modern dancer in Vienna, where she lived for two decades, married to Carl Hollitzer (separated in 1910), a renowned Austrian painter. She was the last to die—in 1946 in Copenhagen.

==Renewed attention==
The Barrison Sisters came to renewed public attention in the first decade of the 21st century when they were featured on the label of Five Wives Vodka, produced by Ogden&#x27;s Own Distillery in Utah; the vodka was initially rejected for sale in the adjacent control state of Idaho, an action for which the Idaho State Liquor Division was later awarded a 2013 Muzzles Award by the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression.

A Danish book about the phenomenon was published in 2020.
It won the Danish annual history book award for 2020.

<doc id="146903" wikidata="Q752176" url="?curid=146903" title="Texture mapping">
<text>Texture mapping is a term used in computer graphics to describe how 2D images are projected onto 3D models. The most common variant is the UV unwrap, which can be described as an inverse paper cutout, where the surfaces of a 3D model is cut apart so that it can be unfolded into a 2D coordinate space (UV Space).

== Semantic ==
Texture mapping can both refer to the task of unwrapping a 3D model, the abstract that a 3D model has textures applied to it and the related algorithm of the 3D software.

Texture map refers to a Raster graphics also called image, texture. If the texture stores a specific property it&#x27;s also referred to as color map, roughness map... 

The coordinate space which converts from the 3D space of a 3D model into a 2D space so that it can sample from the Texture map is called: UV Space, UV Coordinates, Texture Space.

== Algorithm ==
A simplified explanation of how a algorithm could work to render an image:

# For each pixel we trace the coordinates of the screen into the 3D scene.
# If we hit a 3D model, or more precise the polygon of a 3D model we read the 2D UV coordinates.
# We use the UV Coordinates to read the color from the texture and apply it to the pixel.

==History==
The original technique was pioneered by Edwin Catmull in 1974 as part of his doctoral thesis.

Texture mapping originally referred to diffuse mapping, a method that simply mapped pixels from a texture to a 3D surface (&quot;wrapping&quot; the image around the object). In recent decades, the advent of multi-pass rendering, multitexturing, mipmaps, and more complex mappings such as height mapping, bump mapping, normal mapping, displacement mapping, reflection mapping, specular mapping, occlusion mapping, and many other variations on the technique (controlled by a materials system) have made it possible to simulate near-photorealism in real time by vastly reducing the number of polygons and lighting calculations needed to construct a realistic and functional 3D scene.

==Texture maps==

A is an image applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape or polygon. This may be a bitmap image or a procedural texture. They may be stored in common image file formats, referenced by 3D model formats or material definitions, and assembled into resource bundles.

They may have one to three dimensions, although two dimensions are most common for visible surfaces. For use with modern hardware, texture map data may be stored in swizzled or tiled orderings to improve cache coherency. Rendering APIs typically manage texture map resources (which may be located in device memory) as buffers or surfaces, and may allow &#x27;render to texture&#x27; for additional effects such as post processing or environment mapping.

They usually contain RGB color data (either stored as direct color, compressed formats, or indexed color), and sometimes an additional channel for alpha blending (RGBA) especially for billboards and &quot;decal&quot; overlay textures. It is possible to use the alpha channel (which may be convenient to store in formats parsed by hardware) for other uses such as specularity.

Multiple texture maps (or channels) may be combined for control over specularity, normals, displacement, or subsurface scattering e.g. for skin rendering.

Multiple texture images may be combined in texture atlases or array textures to reduce state changes for modern hardware. (They may be considered a modern evolution of tile map graphics). Modern hardware often supports cube map textures with multiple faces for environment mapping.

===Creation===
Texture maps may be acquired by scanning/digital photography, designed in image manipulation software such as GIMP, Photoshop, or painted onto 3D surfaces directly in a 3D paint tool such as Mudbox or ZBrush.

===Texture application===
This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Every vertex in a polygon is assigned a texture coordinate (which in the 2d case is also known as UV coordinates).
This may be done through explicit assignment of vertex attributes, manually edited in a 3D modelling package through UV unwrapping tools. It is also possible to associate a procedural transformation from 3D space to texture space with the material. This might be accomplished via planar projection or, alternatively, cylindrical or spherical mapping. More complex mappings may consider the distance along a surface to minimize distortion.
These coordinates are interpolated across the faces of polygons to sample the texture map during rendering.
Textures may be repeated or mirrored to extend a finite rectangular bitmap over a larger area, or they may have a one-to-one unique &quot;injective&quot; mapping from every piece of a surface (which is important for render mapping and light mapping, also known as baking).

====Texture space====
Texture mapping maps the model surface (or screen space during rasterization) into texture space; in this space, the texture map is visible in its undistorted form. UV unwrapping tools typically provide a view in texture space for manual editing of texture coordinates. Some rendering techniques such as subsurface scattering may be performed approximately by texture-space operations.

===Multitexturing===
Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. For instance, a light map texture may be used to light a surface as an alternative to recalculating that lighting every time the surface is rendered. Microtextures or detail textures are used to add higher frequency details, and dirt maps may add weathering and variation; this can greatly reduce the apparent periodicity of repeating textures. Modern graphics may use more than 10 layers, which are combined using shaders, for greater fidelity. Another multitexture technique is bump mapping, which allows a texture to directly control the facing direction of a surface for the purposes of its lighting calculations; it can give a very good appearance of a complex surface (such as tree bark or rough concrete) that takes on lighting detail in addition to the usual detailed coloring. Bump mapping has become popular in recent video games, as graphics hardware has become powerful enough to accommodate it in real-time.

===Texture filtering===
The way that samples (e.g. when viewed as pixels on the screen) are calculated from the texels (texture pixels) is governed by texture filtering. The cheapest method is to use the nearest-neighbour interpolation, but bilinear interpolation or trilinear interpolation between mipmaps are two commonly used alternatives which reduce aliasing or jaggies. In the event of a texture coordinate being outside the texture, it is either clamped or wrapped. Anisotropic filtering better eliminates directional artefacts when viewing textures from oblique viewing angles.

===Texture streaming===
Texture streaming is a means of using data streams for textures, where each texture is available in two or more different resolutions, as to determine which texture should be loaded into memory and used based on draw distance from the viewer and how much memory is available for textures. Texture streaming allows a rendering engine to use low resolution textures for objects far away from the viewer&#x27;s camera, and resolve those into more detailed textures, read from a data source, as the point of view nears the objects.

===Baking===
As an optimization, it is possible to render detail from a complex, high-resolution model or expensive process (such as global illumination) into a surface texture (possibly on a low-resolution model). &quot;Baking&quot; is also known as render mapping. This technique is most commonly used for light maps, but may also be used to generate normal maps and displacement maps. Some computer games (e.g. Messiah) have used this technique. The original Quake software engine used on-the-fly baking to combine light maps and colour maps (&quot;surface caching&quot;).

Baking can be used as a form of level of detail generation, where a complex scene with many different elements and materials may be approximated by a &quot;single&quot; element with a &quot;single&quot; texture, which is then algorithmically reduced for lower rendering cost and fewer drawcalls. It is also used to take high-detail models from 3D sculpting software and point cloud scanning and approximate them with meshes more suitable for realtime rendering.

==Rasterisation algorithms==
Various techniques have evolved in software and hardware implementations. Each offers different trade-offs in precision, versatility and performance.

===Affine texture mapping===
Affine texture mapping linearly interpolates texture coordinates across a surface, and so is the fastest form of texture mapping. Some software and hardware (such as the original PlayStation) project vertices in 3D space onto the screen during rendering and linearly interpolate the texture coordinates &quot;in screen space&quot; between them. This may be done by incrementing fixed point UV coordinates, or by an incremental error algorithm akin to Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm.

In contrast to perpendicular polygons, this leads to noticeable distortion with perspective transformations (see figure: the checker box texture appears bent), especially as primitives near the camera. Such distortion may be reduced with the subdivision of the polygon into smaller ones.

For the case of rectangular objects, using quad primitives can look less incorrect than the same rectangle split into triangles, but because interpolating 4 points adds complexity to the rasterization, most early implementations preferred triangles only. Some hardware, such as the forward texture mapping used by the Nvidia NV1, was able to offer efficient quad primitives. With perspective correction (see below) triangles become equivalent and this advantage disappears.

For rectangular objects that are at right angles to the viewer, like floors and walls, the perspective only needs to be corrected in one direction across the screen, rather than both. The correct perspective mapping can be calculated at the left and right edges of the floor, and then an affine linear interpolation across that horizontal span will look correct, because every pixel along that line is the same distance from the viewer.

===Perspective correctness===
Perspective correct texturing accounts for the vertices&#x27; positions in 3D space, rather than simply interpolating coordinates in 2D screen space. This achieves the correct visual effect but it is more expensive to calculate.

To perform perspective correction of the texture coordinates formula_1 and formula_2, with formula_3 being the depth component from the viewer&#x27;s point of view, we can take advantage of the fact that the values formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 are linear in screen space across the surface being textured. In contrast, the original formula_3, formula_1 and formula_2, before the division, are not linear across the surface in screen space. We can therefore linearly interpolate these reciprocals across the surface, computing corrected values at each pixel, to result in a perspective correct texture mapping.

To do this, we first calculate the reciprocals at each vertex of our geometry (3 points for a triangle). For vertex formula_10 we have formula_11. Then, we linearly interpolate these reciprocals between the formula_10 vertices (e.g., using barycentric coordinates), resulting in interpolated values across the surface. At a given point, this yields the interpolated formula_13, and formula_14. Note that this formula_13 cannot be yet used as our texture coordinates as our division by formula_3 altered their coordinate system.

To correct back to the formula_17 space we first calculate the corrected formula_3 by again taking the reciprocal formula_19. Then we use this to correct our formula_13: formula_21 and formula_22.

This correction makes it so that in parts of the polygon that are closer to the viewer the difference from pixel to pixel between texture coordinates is smaller (stretching the texture wider) and in parts that are farther away this difference is larger (compressing the texture).
:Affine texture mapping directly interpolates a texture coordinate formula_23 between two endpoints formula_24 and formula_25:
::formula_26 where formula_27
:Perspective correct mapping interpolates after dividing by depth formula_28, then uses its interpolated reciprocal to recover the correct coordinate:
::formula_29

3D graphics hardware typically supports perspective correct texturing.

Various techniques have evolved for rendering texture mapped geometry into images with different quality/precision tradeoffs, which can be applied to both software and hardware.

Classic software texture mappers generally did only simple mapping with at most one lighting effect (typically applied through a lookup table), and the perspective correctness was about 16 times more expensive.

===Restricted camera rotation===
The &quot;Doom engine&quot; restricted the world to vertical walls and horizontal floors/ceilings, with a camera that could only rotate about the vertical axis. This meant the walls would be a constant depth coordinate along a vertical line and the floors/ceilings would have a constant depth along a horizontal line. After performing one perspective correction calculation for the depth, the rest of the line could use fast affine mapping. Some later renderers of this era simulated a small amount of camera pitch with shearing which allowed the appearance of greater freedom whilst using the same rendering technique.

Some engines were able to render texture mapped Heightmaps (e.g. Nova Logic&#x27;s Voxel Space, and the engine for Outcast) via Bresenham-like incremental algorithms, producing the appearance of a texture mapped landscape without the use of traditional geometric primitives.

===Subdivision for perspective correction===
Every triangle can be further subdivided into groups of about 16 pixels in order to achieve two goals. First, keeping the arithmetic mill busy at all times. Second, producing faster arithmetic results.

====World space subdivision====
For perspective texture mapping without hardware support, a triangle is broken down into smaller triangles for rendering and affine mapping is used on them. The reason this technique works is that the distortion of affine mapping becomes much less noticeable on smaller polygons. The Sony PlayStation made extensive use of this because it only supported affine mapping in hardware but had a relatively high triangle throughput compared to its peers.

====Screen space subdivision====
Software renderers generally preferred screen subdivision because it has less overhead. Additionally, they try to do linear interpolation along a line of pixels to simplify the set-up (compared to 2d affine interpolation) and thus again the overhead (also affine texture-mapping does not fit into the low number of registers of the x86 CPU; the 68000 or any RISC is much more suited).

A different approach was taken for &quot;Quake&quot;, which would calculate perspective correct coordinates only once every 16 pixels of a scanline and linearly interpolate between them, effectively running at the speed of linear interpolation because the perspective correct calculation runs in parallel on the co-processor. The polygons are rendered independently, hence it may be possible to switch between spans and columns or diagonal directions depending on the orientation of the polygon normal to achieve a more constant z but the effort seems not to be worth it.

====Other techniques====
Another technique was approximating the perspective with a faster calculation, such as a polynomial. Still another technique uses 1/z value of the last two drawn pixels to linearly extrapolate the next value. The division is then done starting from those values so that only a small remainder has to be divided but the amount of bookkeeping makes this method too slow on most systems.

Finally, the Build engine extended the constant distance trick used for Doom by finding the line of constant distance for arbitrary polygons and rendering along it.

===Hardware implementations===
Texture mapping hardware was originally developed for simulation (e.g. as implemented in the Evans and Sutherland ESIG and Singer-Link Digital Image Generators DIG), and professional graphics workstations such as Silicon Graphics, broadcast digital video effects machines such as the Ampex ADO and later appeared in Arcade cabinets, consumer video game consoles, and PC video cards in the mid-1990s. In flight simulation, texture mapping provided important motion and altitude cues necessary for pilot training not available on untextured surfaces. It was also in flight simulation applications, that texture mapping was implemented for real-time processing with prefiltered texture patterns stored in memory for real-time access by the video processor.

Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) provide specialised fixed function units called &quot;texture samplers&quot;, or &quot;texture mapping units&quot;, to perform texture mapping, usually with trilinear filtering or better multi-tap anisotropic filtering and hardware for decoding specific formats such as DXTn. As of 2016, texture mapping hardware is ubiquitous as most SOCs contain a suitable GPU.

Some hardware combines texture mapping with hidden-surface determination in tile based deferred rendering or scanline rendering; such systems only fetch the visible texels at the expense of using greater workspace for transformed vertices. Most systems have settled on the Z-buffering approach, which can still reduce the texture mapping workload with front-to-back sorting.

Among earlier graphics hardware, there were two competing paradigms of how to deliver a texture to the screen:
* Forward texture mapping iterates through each texel on the texture, and decides where to place it on the screen.
* Inverse texture mapping instead iterates through pixels on the screen, and decides what texel to use for each.

Inverse texture mapping is the method which has become standard in modern hardware.

====Inverse texture mapping====
With this method, a pixel on the screen is mapped to a point on the texture. Each vertex of a rendering primitive is projected to a point on the screen, and each of these points is mapped to a u,v texel coordinate on the texture. A rasterizer will interpolate between these points to fill in each pixel covered by the primitive.

The primary advantage is that each pixel covered by a primitive will be traversed exactly once. Once a primitive&#x27;s vertices are transformed, the amount of remaining work scales directly with how many pixels it covers on the screen.

The main disadvantage versus forward texture mapping is that the memory access pattern in the texture space will not be linear if the texture is at an angle to the screen. This disadvantage is often addressed by texture caching techniques, such as the swizzled texture memory arrangement.

The linear interpolation can be used directly for simple and efficient affine texture mapping, but can also be adapted for perspective correctness.

====Forward texture mapping====
Forward texture mapping maps each texel of the texture to a pixel on the screen. After transforming a rectangular primitive to a place on the screen, a forward texture mapping renderer iterates through each texel on the texture, splatting each one onto a pixel of the frame buffer.

This was used by some hardware, such as the 3DO, the Sega Saturn and the NV1.

The primary advantage is that the texture will be accessed in a simple linear order, allowing very efficient caching of the texture data. However, this benefit is also its disadvantage: as a primitive gets smaller on screen, it still has to iterate over every texel in the texture, causing many pixels to be overdrawn redundantly.

This method is also well suited for rendering quad primitives rather than reducing them to triangles, which provided an advantage when perspective correct texturing was not available in hardware. This is because the affine distortion of a quad looks less incorrect than the same quad split into two triangles (see affine texture mapping above). The NV1 hardware also allowed a quadratic interpolation mode to provide an even better approximation of perspective correctness.

The existing hardware implementations did not provide effective UV coordinate mapping, which became an important technique for 3D modelling and assisted in clipping the texture correctly when the primitive goes over the edge of the screen. These shortcomings could have been addressed with further development, but GPU design has since mostly moved toward inverse mapping.

==Applications==
Beyond 3D rendering, the availability of texture mapping hardware has inspired its use for accelerating other tasks:

===Tomography===
It is possible to use texture mapping hardware to accelerate both the reconstruction of voxel data sets from tomographic scans, and to visualize the results.

===User interfaces===
Many user interfaces use texture mapping to accelerate animated transitions of screen elements, e.g. Exposé in Mac OS X.

<text>A depth buffer, also known as a z-buffer, is a type of data buffer used in computer graphics to represent depth information of objects in 3D space from a particular perspective. The depth is stored as a height map of the scene, the values representing a distance to camera, with 0 being the closest. The encoding scheme may be flipped with the highest number being the value closest to camera. Depth buffers are an aid to rendering a scene to ensure that the correct polygons properly occlude other polygons. Z-buffering was first described in 1974 by Wolfgang Straßer in his PhD thesis on fast algorithms for rendering occluded objects. A similar solution to determining overlapping polygons is the painter&#x27;s algorithm, which is capable of handling non-opaque scene elements, though at the cost of efficiency and incorrect results.

In a 3D-rendering pipeline, when an object is projected on the screen, the depth (z-value) of a generated fragment in the projected screen image is compared to the value already stored in the buffer (depth test), and replaces it if the new value is closer. It works in tandem with the rasterizer, which computes the colored values. The fragment output by the rasterizer is saved if it is not overlapped by another fragment.

When viewing an image containing partially or fully overlapping opaque objects or surfaces, it is not possible to fully see those objects that are farthest away from the viewer and behind other objects (i.e., some surfaces are hidden behind others). If there were no mechanism for managing overlapping surfaces, surfaces would render on top of each other, not caring if they are meant to be behind other objects. The identification and removal of these surfaces are called the hidden-surface problem. To check for overlap, the computer calculates the z-value of a pixel corresponding to the first object and compares it with the z-value at the same pixel location in the z-buffer. If the calculated z-value is smaller than the z-value already in the z-buffer (i.e., the new pixel is closer), then the current z-value in the z-buffer is replaced with the calculated value. This is repeated for all objects and surfaces in the scene (often in parallel). In the end, the z-buffer will allow correct reproduction of the usual depth perception: a close object hides one further away. This is called z-culling.

The z-buffer has the same internal data structure as an image, namely a 2D-array, with the only difference being that it stores a single value for each screen pixel instead of color images that use 3 values to create color. This makes the z-buffer appear black-and-white because it is not storing color information. The buffer has the same dimensions as the screen buffer for consistency.

Primary visibility tests (such as back-face culling) and secondary visibility tests (such as overlap checks and screen clipping) are usually performed on objects&#x27; polygons in order to skip specific polygons that are unnecessary to render. Z-buffer, by comparison, is comparatively expensive, so performing primary and secondary visibility tests relieve the z-buffer of some duty.

The granularity of a z-buffer has a great influence on the scene quality: the traditional 16-bit z-buffer can result in artifacts (called &quot;z-fighting&quot; or stitching) when two objects are very close to each other. A more modern 24-bit or 32-bit z-buffer behaves much better, although the problem cannot be eliminated without additional algorithms. An 8-bit z-buffer is almost never used since it has too little precision.

==Uses==

Z-buffering is a technique used in almost all contemporary computers, laptops, and mobile phones for generating 3D computer graphics. The primary use now is for video games, which require fast and accurate processing of 3D scenes. Z-buffers are often implemented in hardware within consumer graphics cards. Z-buffering is also used (implemented as software as opposed to hardware) for producing computer-generated special effects for films.

Furthermore, Z-buffer data obtained from rendering a surface from a light&#x27;s point-of-view permits the creation of shadows by the shadow mapping technique.

==Developments==

Even with small enough granularity, quality problems may arise when precision in the z-buffer&#x27;s distance values are not spread evenly over distance. Nearer values are much more precise (and hence can display closer objects better) than values that are farther away. Generally, this is desirable, but sometimes it will cause artifacts to appear as objects become more distant. A variation on z-buffering which results in more evenly distributed precision is called w-buffering (see below).

At the start of a new scene, the z-buffer must be cleared to a defined value, usually 1.0, because this value is the upper limit (on a scale of 0 to 1) of depth, meaning that no object is present at this point through the viewing frustum.

The invention of the z-buffer concept is most often attributed to Edwin Catmull, although Wolfgang Straßer described this idea in his 1974 Ph.D. thesis months before Catmull&#x27;s invention.

On more recent PC graphics cards (1999–2005), z-buffer management uses a significant chunk of the available memory bandwidth. Various methods have been employed to reduce the performance cost of z-buffering, such as lossless compression (computer resources to compress/decompress are cheaper than bandwidth) and ultra-fast hardware z-clear that makes obsolete the &quot;one frame positive, one frame negative&quot; trick (skipping inter-frame clear altogether using signed numbers to cleverly check depths).

Some games, notably several games later in the N64&#x27;s life cycle, decided to either minimize Z buffering (for example, rendering the background first without z buffering and only using Z buffering for the foreground objects) or to omit it entirely, to reduce memory bandwidth requirements and memory requirements respectively. Super Smash Bros. and F-Zero X are two N64 games that minimized Z buffering to increase framerates. Several Factor 5 games also minimized or omitted Z buffering. On the N64 Z Buffering can consume up to 4x as much bandwidth as opposed to not using Z buffering. 

Mechwarrior 2 on PC supported resolutions up to 800x600 on the original 4 MB 3DFX Voodoo due to not using Z Buffering. 
==Z-culling==

In rendering, z-culling is early pixel elimination based on depth, a method that provides an increase in performance when rendering of hidden surfaces is costly. It is a direct consequence of z-buffering, where the depth of each pixel candidate is compared to the depth of the existing geometry behind which it might be hidden.

When using a z-buffer, a pixel can be culled (discarded) as soon as its depth is known, which makes it possible to skip the entire process of lighting and texturing a pixel that would not be visible anyway. Also, time-consuming pixel shaders will generally not be executed for the culled pixels. This makes z-culling a good optimization candidate in situations where fillrate, lighting, texturing, or pixel shaders are the main bottlenecks.

While z-buffering allows the geometry to be unsorted, sorting polygons by increasing depth (thus using a reverse painter&#x27;s algorithm) allows each screen pixel to be rendered fewer times. This can increase performance in fillrate-limited scenes with large amounts of overdraw, but if not combined with z-buffering it suffers from severe problems such as:
* polygons occluding one another in a cycle (e.g. triangle A occludes B, B occludes C, C occludes A), and
* the lack of any canonical &quot;closest&quot; point on a triangle (i.e. no matter whether one sorts triangles by their centroid or closest point or furthest point, one can always find two triangles A and B such that A is &quot;closer&quot; but in reality B should be drawn first).
As such, a reverse painter&#x27;s algorithm cannot be used as an alternative to Z-culling (without strenuous re-engineering), except as an optimization to Z-culling. For example, an optimization might be to keep polygons sorted according to x/y-location and z-depth to provide bounds, in an effort to quickly determine if two polygons might possibly have an occlusion interaction.

==Mathematics==

The range of depth values in camera space to be rendered is often defined between a formula_1 and formula_2 value of formula_3.

After a perspective transformation, the new value of formula_3, or formula_5, is defined by:
: formula_6

After an orthographic projection, the new value of formula_3, or formula_5, is defined by:
:formula_9

where formula_3 is the old value of formula_3 in camera space, and is sometimes called formula_12 or formula_13.

The resulting values of formula_5 are normalized between the values of -1 and 1, where the formula_1 plane is at -1 and the formula_16 plane is at 1. Values outside of this range correspond to points which are not in the viewing frustum, and shouldn&#x27;t be rendered.

===Fixed-point representation===

Typically, these values are stored in the z-buffer of the hardware graphics accelerator in fixed point format. First they are normalized to a more common range which is by substituting the appropriate conversion formula_17 into the previous formula:

:formula_18

Simplifying:
:formula_19

Second, the above formula is multiplied by formula_20 where d is the depth of the z-buffer (usually 16, 24 or 32 bits) and rounding the result to an integer:

:formula_21

This formula can be inverted and derived in order to calculate the z-buffer resolution (the &#x27;granularity&#x27; mentioned earlier). The inverse of the above formula_22:

:formula_23

where formula_20

The z-buffer resolution in terms of camera space would be the incremental value resulted from the smallest change in the integer stored in the z-buffer, which is +1 or -1. Therefore, this resolution can be calculated from the derivative of formula_3 as a function of formula_5:

:formula_27

Expressing it back in camera space terms, by substituting formula_5 by the above formula_22:

:formula_30

This shows that the values of formula_5 are grouped much more densely near the formula_1 plane, and much more sparsely farther away, resulting in better precision closer to the camera. The smaller formula_33 is, the less precision there is far away—having the formula_33 plane set too closely is a common cause of undesirable rendering artifacts in more distant objects.

To implement a z-buffer, the values of formula_5 are linearly interpolated across screen space between the vertices of the current polygon, and these intermediate values are generally stored in the z-buffer in fixed point format.

===W-buffer===

To implement a w-buffer, the old values of formula_3 in camera space, or formula_12, are stored in the buffer, generally in floating point format. However, these values cannot be linearly interpolated across screen space from the vertices—they usually have to be inverted, interpolated, and then inverted again. The resulting values of formula_12, as opposed to formula_5, are spaced evenly between formula_1 and formula_2. There are implementations of the w-buffer that avoid the inversions altogether.

Whether a z-buffer or w-buffer results in a better image depends on the application.

<doc id="146905" wikidata="Q966679" url="?curid=146905" title="Farley Mowat">
<text>Farley McGill Mowat, (May 12, 1921 – May 6, 2014) was a Canadian writer and environmentalist. His works were translated into 52 languages, and he sold more than 17 million books. He achieved fame with the publication of his books on the Canadian north, such as &quot;People of the Deer&quot; (1952) and &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1963). The latter, an account of his experiences with wolves in the Arctic, was made into a film of the same name released in 1983. For his body of work as a writer he won the annual Vicky Metcalf Award for Children&#x27;s Literature in 1970.

Mowat&#x27;s advocacy for environmental causes earned him praise, but his admission, after some of his books&#x27; claims had been debunked, that he &quot;never let the facts get in the way of the truth&quot; earned harsh criticism, while his supporters noted that the literary &quot;exaggerations… [in] his books almost single-handedly drew attention to the plight of the Inuit and serious environmental issues, bringing about substantive changes of policy in Ottawa&quot;. Descriptions of Mowat refer to his &quot;commitment to ideals&quot; and &quot;poetic descriptions and vivid images&quot; as well as his strong antipathies, which provoke &quot;ridicule, lampoons and, at times, evangelical condemnation&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Mowat was born May 12, 1921, in Belleville, Ontario, and grew up in Richmond Hill, Ontario. His great-great-uncle was Ontario premier Sir Oliver Mowat, and his father, Angus Mowat, was a librarian, who fought in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. His mother was Helen Lilian Thomson, daughter of Henry Andrew Hoffman Thomson and Georgina Phillips Farley Thomson of Trenton, Ontario. Mowat started writing, in his words &quot;mostly verse&quot;, when his family lived in Windsor from 1930 to 1933.

In the 1930s, the Mowat family moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where as a teenager Mowat wrote about birds in a column for the &quot;Saskatoon Star-Phoenix&quot;. During this time, he also wrote his own nature newsletter, &quot;Nature Lore&quot;. In the 1930s, Mowat studied zoology at the University of Toronto but never completed a degree. He took his first collecting expedition in the summer of 1939 to Saskatoon with fellow zoology student Frank Banfield, who collected data regarding mammals while Mowat focused on birds. They sold their collections to the Royal Ontario Museum to finance their trip. Before the pair had enlisted for service in World War II, Banfield published his field notes in the &quot;Canadian Field-Naturalist&quot;, while Mowat published his when he returned from serving in Europe.

==War service==
During World War II, Mowat joined the Canadian Army and was commissioned as a supernumerary second lieutenant into the Second Battalion, The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (affectionately known as the &quot;Hasty Ps&quot;) on 19 July 1940. He went overseas as a reinforcement officer for that regiment, joining the Canadian Army in the United Kingdom. On July 10, 1943, he was a subaltern in command of a rifle platoon and participated in the initial landings of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.

Mowat served throughout the campaign as a platoon commander and moved to Italy in September 1943, seeing further combat until December 1943. During the Moro River Campaign, part of the Italian Campaign, he suffered from battle stress, heightened after an incident on Christmas Day during the Battle of Ortona, the &quot;Italian Stalingrad&quot;, when he was left weeping at the feet of an unconscious friend, Lieutenant Allan (Al) Park, who had an enemy bullet in his head. He then accepted a job as Intelligence Officer at battalion headquarters, later moving to Brigade Headquarters. He stayed in Italy with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division for most of the war and was eventually promoted to the rank of captain.

Mowat moved with the division to northwest Europe in early 1945. There, he worked as an intelligence agent in the Netherlands and went through enemy lines to start unofficial negotiations about food drops with General Blaskowitz. The food drops, during the final 10 days before the surrender of Nazi Germany, proceeded under the codenames Operations Manna (Commonwealth air forces) and Chowhound (American), saving thousands of Dutch lives.

Mowat also formed the 1st Canadian Army Museum Collection Team, according to his book &quot;My Father&#x27;s Son&quot;, and arranged for the transport to Canada of several tons of German military equipment, including the piloted V1 rocket Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg and several armoured vehicles. Some of these vehicles are on display today at Canadian Forces Base Borden&#x27;s tank museum, as well as the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.

Mowat was discharged in 1945, at the conclusion of World War II, as a captain and was considered for promotion to major. However, he declined the offer as it would have required his volunteering to stay in the Army until &quot;no longer needed&quot;, which Mowat assumed meant duty with the Canadian Army Occupation Force (CAOF) (but might also have meant the conclusion of the war with Japan). He was entitled to the following medals as a result of his service: the 1939–1945 Star, the Italy Star, the France and Germany Star, the Defence Medal, the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal and the War Medal 1939–1945.

== Post-war ==

In 1947, Mowat was hired as field technician for American naturalist Francis Harper&#x27;s study of the barren-ground caribou in the Nueltin Lake area—now Nunavut&#x27;s Kivalliq Region, resulting in the publication of Harper&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Caribou of Keewatin.&quot; Two young Inuit were with them, fifteen-year-old Inuk Luke Anoteelik (Luke Anowtalik) and his sister Rita, who were the sole survivors of starvation in an Inuit village. Luke Anowtalik went on to become well known for his distinctive carvings of antler and bone that are now in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada. Due to a clash of personalities, Mowat undertook his own explorations. &quot;Harper later extracted a promise that neither would mention the other in their respective future writing, a promise also extracted from Mowat by later field companions for their lifetimes.&quot;

In the late 1940s, Mowat was hired by Frank Banfield—then Chief Mammalogist of the newly formed Canadian Wildlife Service—as field assistant in Banfield&#x27;s ambitious multi-year investigation of the barren-ground caribou,
 which resulted in Banfield&#x27;s influential 1951 publication entitled &quot;The Barren-ground Caribou.&quot; Mowat, who was part of a four-researcher team, was fired by the chief of Canadian Wildlife Service because of complaints from the local population and lack of formal approval for some activities.

==Literary career==

After serving in World War II, Mowat attended the University of Toronto. Mowat&#x27;s first book, &quot;People of the Deer&quot; (1952), was inspired by a field trip to the Canadian Arctic he made while studying at the University of Toronto. Mowat was outraged at the conditions endured by the Inuit living in Northern Canada. The book turned Mowat into a controversial, popular figure.

Mowat became a McClelland and Stewart author when they published his book entitled &quot;The Regiment&quot; in 1955. Jack McClelland, known for his promotion of Canadian authors, became his lifelong friend as well as his publisher. Mowat&#x27;s next book, the children&#x27;s book &quot;Lost in the Barrens&quot; (1956), won a Governor General&#x27;s Award.

In 1963, Mowat wrote a possibly fictionalised account of his experiences in the Canadian Arctic with Arctic wolves entitled &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1963).

In 1985, Mowat started a book tour of the United States to promote &quot;Sea of Slaughter&quot;. He was denied entry by customs agents at Pearson International Airport in Toronto, which was justified by laws that allowed American customs officials to deny entry to entrants they thought were &quot;Communist sympathizers&quot;. Believing gun lobbyists were behind his denial, he came forward with his suspicion. The law was overturned in 1990, and Mowat wrote about his experience in &quot;My Discovery of America&quot; (1985).

Mowat became very interested in Dian Fossey, the American ethologist who studied gorillas and was brutally murdered in Rwanda in 1985. His biography of her was published in 1987, in Canada under the title &quot;Virunga: The Passion of Dian Fossey&quot;, and in the United States as &quot;Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa&quot;—an allusion to Fossey&#x27;s own recounting of her life and research &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1983).

Many of Mowat&#x27;s works are autobiographical, such as &quot;Owls in the Family&quot; (1962, about his childhood), &quot;The Boat Who Wouldn&#x27;t Float&quot; (1969, one of three books about his time living in Newfoundland), and &quot;And No Birds Sang&quot; (1979, about his experience fighting in Italy in World War II).

In 1965, &quot;Westviking&quot; was published, followed 30 years later by &quot;The Farfarers&quot;, which suggests a people he called the Albans preceded the Norse to the High Arctic and the Labrador and Newfoundland coasts.

==Criticism==

In a 1964 book review published in &quot;Canadian Field-Naturalist&quot;, Frank Banfield of the National Museum of Canada, a former Canadian Wildlife Service scientist, compared Mowat&#x27;s 1963 bestseller to Little Red Riding Hood, stating, &quot;I hope that readers of &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; will realize that both stories have about the same factual content.&quot; Mowat responded to Banfield&#x27;s criticisms in a letter to the editor of the &quot;Canadian Field-Naturalist&quot; and signed it &quot;Mowat&#x27;s wolf Uncle Albert&quot;. L. David Mech, a wolf expert, is cited by Warner Shedd, a former regional executive of the National Wildlife Federation, as noting that no scientist, Mowat notwithstanding, has ever encountered a wolf population that primarily subsists on small prey, as claimed in Mowat&#x27;s book. Mech additionally states, &quot;...Mowat is not a scientist, and his book, although presented as truth, is fiction.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; published a dismissive review of &quot;People of the Deer&quot; on February 24, 1952. &quot;The Beaver&quot; was quite hostile in its first review. The second review, by A. E. Porsild, was equally hostile, questioning the existence of the Ihalmiut. Despite a few harsh reviews, however, &quot;People of the Deer&quot; was generally well received, published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;showered with glowing international reviews&quot;.

Duncan Pryde, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trader who pioneered the linguistic study of Inuit languages, attacked Mowat&#x27;s claim to have picked up the language quickly enough in two months to discuss detailed concepts such as shamanism, pointing out that the language is complex and required a year or more for Europeans to master the basics. Pryde said that when Mowat visited his post at Baker Lake in 1958, 10 years after Mowat&#x27;s earlier trip, he could barely speak a single word in the Inuit language.

&quot;Canadian Geographic&quot; published excerpts from &quot;The Farfarers&quot; with the comment that it was &quot;a highly speculative blend of history and archeology. In it, Mowat again draws upon Norse sagas, the chronicles of Irish monks, and accounts of Roman travellers, as well as the works of modern historians and archeologists. It is both detailed and, as with all early history, sketchy. The written record for much of the period covered is scant and the archeological record spotty. Still, such speculative writing can suggest avenues of exploration and study for future researchers. No professional archeologists are known to share Mowat&#x27;s theories but that does not disturb him. A literary gadfly for much of his long career, Mowat is happy to stir up debate and challenge academics to match the visions that he champions and defends with such vigour and relish.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
* 1950s: Mowat won two Canadian &quot;year&#x27;s best&quot; book awards for &quot;Lost in the Barrens&quot;, (Little, Brown, 1956), an adventure novel set in Northern Manitoba and southwestern North West Territories—namely, the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Juvenile Fiction for 1956 and the 1958 Canadian Library Association Book of the Year for Children Award. In 1952, Mowat won the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s President&#x27;s Medal for best short story for &quot;Eskimo Spring&quot;. In 1953, &quot;People of the Deer&quot; was awarded the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award by the Anisfield–Wolf Foundation. In 1956, Mowat won the Governor General&#x27;s Award. And in 1957, the Book of the Year Award, Canadian Association of Children&#x27;s Librarians, for &quot;Lost in the Barrens&quot;. Also, in 1958, Mowat won the Canadian Women&#x27;s Clubs Award for children&#x27;s book &quot;The Dog Who Wouldn&#x27;t Be&quot; and the Hans Christian Andersen International Award.
* 1960s: In 1962, he won the Boys&#x27; Clubs of America Junior Book Award for &quot;Owls in the Family&quot;. In 1963, he won the National Association of Independent Schools Award. In 1965, he made the Hans Christian Andersen Honours List, for juvenile books.
* 1970s: In 1970, &quot;The Boat Who Wouldn&#x27;t Float&quot; won the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour and in 1972, it made the L&#x27;Etoile de la Mer Honours List. Mowat also won the Vicky Metcalf Award, 1970; Mark Twain Award, 1971; and the Curran Award, 1977, for &quot;contributions to understanding wolves&quot;.
* 1980s: He was given the Knight of Mark Twain distinction in 1980. In 1985, he received the Author&#x27;s Award, Foundation for the Advancement of Canadian Letters for &quot;Sea of Slaughter&quot;. In 1988, &quot;Virunga&quot; was designated Book of the Year, Foundation for the Advancement of Canadian Letters, and Mowat was named Author of the Year by the Canadian Booksellers Association. In 1989, he won the Gemini Award for best documentary script, for &quot;The New North.&quot;
* 1990s: In 1991, the Council of Canadians presented him with the Back the Nation Award. 
* 2000s: In 2002, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ship RV Farley Mowat (formerly M/Y Sea Shepherd III / M/Y Ocean Warrior) was named in his honour. Mowat frequently visited it to assist its mission and provided financial support to the group. In 2005, Mowat received the first and only Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Outdoor Book Award. On June 8, 2010, it was announced that Mowat would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.
* 2010s: In 2014, only weeks after his death, a life-sized sculpture of Farley Mowat, commissioned by Toronto businessman Ron Rhodes and executed by the Canadian artist George Bartholomew Boileau, was unveiled at the University of Saskatchewan, located in Saskatoon, where Farley spent many of his formative years. His wife Claire was in attendance. Mowat had seen the finished clay, in the artist&#x27;s studio, several months previously.

Mowat was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981. He had previously been awarded both the Canadian Centennial Medal (1967) and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977).

As an Order of Canada recipient, he automatically qualified for the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal (1992), the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002), and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012).

Farley is also the namesake of the lovable sheepdog in the comic strip by Lynn Johnston, &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;. Johnston and Mowat were long-time friends.

==Affiliations==

Mowat was a strong supporter of the Green Party of Canada and a close friend of the party&#x27;s leader Elizabeth May. The Green Party sent a direct mail fundraising appeal in Mowat&#x27;s name in June 2007, and that same year Mowat became a patron of the Nova Scotia Nature Trust by donating over of his land in Cape Breton Island to the Nature Trust. He was also an honorary director of the North American Native Plant Society. Mowat was described as &quot;a life-long socialist.&quot;

==Farley Mowat Library==

In 2012, independent Canadian publisher Douglas &amp; McIntyre announced they had created the Farley Mowat Library series and would be re-releasing many of his most popular titles, with new designs and introductions, in print and e-book format.

Mowat&#x27;s archives are held at the William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections at McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario.

==Later life==

Mowat and his second wife Claire spent their later years together in Port Hope, Ontario, and their summers on a farm on Cape Breton Island. They attended a local Anglican church in Port Hope about monthly, Claire emphasizing that Mowat was more spiritual than religious, and Mowat stating that he probably believed in God the same way his dog did, and that such ceremonies were important in tying people to each other and the world.

Mowat is considered a saint by the God&#x27;s Gardeners, a fictional religious sect that is the focus of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot;.
Mowat died on May 6, 2014, at age 92. He maintained his interest in Canada&#x27;s wilderness areas throughout his life and could be heard a few days before his death on the CBC Radio One program &quot;The Current&quot; speaking against the provision of Wi-Fi service in national parks. He is buried at the historic St. Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church cemetery in Port Hope.

<text>Scarlet Street is a 1945 American film noir directed by Fritz Lang. The screenplay concerns two criminals who take advantage of a middle-aged painter in order to steal his artwork. The film is based on the French novel &quot;La Chienne&quot; (literally &quot;The Bitch&quot;) by Georges de La Fouchardière, which had been previously dramatized on stage by André Mouëzy-Éon, and cinematically as &quot;La Chienne&quot; (1931) by director Jean Renoir.

The principal actors Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea had earlier appeared together in &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944), also directed by Lang. Local authorities in New York, Milwaukee, and Atlanta banned &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; early in 1946 because of its dark plot and themes.

The film is in the public domain.

==Plot==
New York, 1934 – Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Cross, a late middle-aged cashier for a clothing retailer, is fêted by his employer for 25 years of service. After presenting Chris with a gold watch and kind words, company owner J.J. Hogarth leaves the party and gets into a limousine with his beautiful blonde mistress. Chris muses to a colleague about his desire to be loved by a young woman like that.

Walking home through Greenwich Village still in his tuxedo, Chris sees Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; March being attacked by a drunken assailant; Chris flails the man with his umbrella, who slips and is knocked out by a curb. While Chris dashes off to summon a policeman, the assailant, who is actually Kitty&#x27;s boyfriend Johnny, flees. Chris walks Kitty to her apartment. His wistful remarks about art and formal dinner attire suggest to her that Chris must be a wealthy painter rather than the meek amateur he is. Enamored of Kitty and thinking she feels affection for him, Chris tells her about his loveless marriage. His shrewish wife Adele idolizes her previous husband, a policeman honored for drowning while trying to rescue a suicidal woman.

Needing funds for a shady business deal, Johnny believes that Kitty should play on Chris&#x27;s naivete and feign romantic interest to swindle him. Kitty persuades Chris to rent her an apartment, suggesting that he can use it as his art studio. Chris falls for it, steals $500 in insurance bonds from his wife, and later $1,000 cash from his employer.

Unknown to Chris, Johnny tries selling some of his paintings, leaving them with a street vendor who believes them worth no more than $25. They attract the interest of art critic Damon Janeway, who declares the work original and brilliant. After Johnny persuades Kitty to pretend that she painted them, she charms Janeway with Chris&#x27;s own views about art. Captivated by the paintings and her, Janeway advances Kitty’s career. However, Adele sees her husband&#x27;s paintings, signed &quot;Katherine March&quot;, in the window of an exclusive art gallery and accuses Chris of copying March&#x27;s work. Chris confronts Kitty, who claims that she had sold them because she needed the money. Delighted that his creations are appreciated, he lets her remain the public face of his art. It becomes a huge commercial success, but Chris never receives a dime.

Adele&#x27;s supposedly dead first husband Higgins appears at Chris&#x27;s office to extort money from him. Higgins disappeared after discovering $2,700 in the purse of the woman he had tried to save. Already suspected of taking bribes from speakeasies, he faked his death to escape both his crimes and his gargoyle of a wife. Chris steals another $200 from the safe for Higgins. Chris plots for Adele to ambush Higgins, delighted that his marriage will be invalidated when Higgins is found alive.

Chris goes to see Kitty, believing that he is now free and that she will marry him. He finds Johnny and Kitty in an embrace, confirming his worst fears. However, when Chris still asks Kitty to marry him, she spurns him for being old and ugly and laughs in his face. Enraged, he stabs her to death with an ice pick. The police appear at Chris&#x27;s office, tipped off by Higgins that Chris has embezzled money from Hogarth, who refuses to press charges, but fires Chris. Johnny is arrested for Kitty&#x27;s murder.

At the trial, Johnny&#x27;s past works against him. Chris denies painting the pictures, claiming to be an untalented artist. Several witnesses confirm Chris&#x27;s testimony and attest to Johnny&#x27;s misdeeds and bad character. Johnny is convicted and put to death, and Kitty is immortalized as a great talent lost too soon.

Haunted by getting away with murder, Chris attempts to hang himself on the night of Johnny&#x27;s execution, but is prevented by Good Samaritans. Five years later he is homeless and destitute, with no way of claiming credit for his own paintings. He witnesses his portrait of Kitty selling for $10,000. Tormented by voices of the ghosts of Kitty and Johnny, Chris wanders New York, broke, broken, and mad.

==Production==

&quot;Scarlet Street&quot; reunited director Fritz Lang with actors Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea, who had worked with him in &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944). The film was based on the French novel &quot;La Chienne&quot; (literally &quot;The Bitch&quot;) by Georges de La Fouchardière, which had been dramatized on stage by André Mouëzy-Éon, and cinematically as &quot;La Chienne&quot; (1931) by director Jean Renoir. Lang&#x27;s film &quot;Human Desire&quot; (1954) was based on another Renoir film, &quot;La Bête humaine&quot; (1938), which was based on Émile Zola&#x27;s novel on the same name. Renoir was said to have disliked both of Lang&#x27;s films.

&quot;Scarlet Street&quot; is similar to &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; in its themes, cast, crew and characters. Robinson again plays a lonely middle-aged man, and Bennett and Duryea once more play the criminal couple. Both films were photographed by Milton R. Krasner. Walter Wanger, who produced the film, had earlier produced Lang&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;.

Though &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; is considered a film noir classic, along with Lang&#x27;s earlier film &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;, Robinson, who noticed the thematic similarities between the two, found the production of &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; monotonous and was eager to finish it and move on to other projects. Robinson had also disliked making &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;.
Twelve paintings created for the film by John Decker were sent to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City for exhibition in March 1946.

==Reception==

===Box office===
According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned rentals of $2.5 million in the U.S.

===Reception===

&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review. He wrote:

But for those who are looking for drama of a firm and incisive sort, &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; is not likely to furnish a particularly rare experience. Dudley Nichols wrote the story from a French original, in which it might well have had a stinging and grisly vitality. In this presentation, however, it seems a sluggish and manufactured tale, emerging much more from sheer contrivance than from the passions of the characters involved. And the slight twist of tension which tightens around the principal character is lost in the middle of the picture when he is shelved for a dull stretch of plot. In the role of the love-blighted cashier Edward G. Robinson performs monotonously and with little illumination of an adventurous spirit seeking air. And, as the girl whom he loves, Joan Bennett is static and colorless, completely lacking the malevolence that should flash in her evil role. Only Dan Duryea as her boy friend hits a proper and credible stride, making a vicious and serpentine creature out of a cheap, chiseling tinhorn off the streets.

A review in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine stated: &quot;Fritz Lang&#x27;s production and direction ably project the sordid tale of the romance between a milquetoast character and a gold-digging blonde ... Edward G. Robinson is the mild cashier and amateur painter whose love for Joan Bennett leads him to embezzlement, murder and disgrace. Two stars turn in top work to keep the interest high, and Dan Duryea&#x27;s portrayal of the crafty and crooked opportunist whom Bennett loves is a standout in furthering the melodrama.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine gave &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; a negative review, describing the plot as clichéd and with dimwitted, unethical, stock characters.

Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote in 2003:&quot;Scarlet Street&quot; is a bleak psychological film noir that has the same leading actors as his 1944 film &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;. It sets a long-standing trend of a criminal not punished for his crime; this is the first Hollywood film where that happened ... The Edward G. Robinson character is viewed as an ordinary man who is influenced by an evil couple who take advantage of his vulnerability and lead him down an amoral road where he eventually in a passionate moment loses his head and commits murder. Chris&#x27;s imagination can no longer save him from his dreadful existence, and his complete downfall comes about as the talented artist loses track of reality and his dignity.
In 1995, Matthew Bernstein wrote in &quot;Cinema Journal&quot;: &quot;The film is a dense, well-structured film noir and has been analyzed and interpreted numerous times. Some of the earliest interpretations came from censors in three different cities,&quot; adding:
On January 4, 1946, the New York State Censor Board banned &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; entirely, relying on the statute that gave it power to censor films that were &quot;obscene, indecent, immoral, inhuman, sacrilegious&quot; or whose exhibition &quot;would tend to corrupt morals or incite to crime.&quot; As if in a chain reaction, one week later the Motion Picture Commission for the city of Milwaukee also banned the film as part of a new policy encouraged by police for &quot;stricter regulation of undesirable films.&quot; On February 3 Christina Smith, the city censor of Atlanta, argued that because of &quot;the sordid life it portrayed, the treatment of illicit love, the failure of the characters to receive orthodox punishment from the police, and because the picture would tend to weaken a respect for the law,&quot; &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; was &quot;licentious, profane, obscure and contrary to the good order of the community.&quot;... Universal was discouraged from challenging the constitutionality of the censors by the protests of the national religious groups that arose as the Atlanta case went to court.

In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

<text>A penal colony or exile colony is a settlement used to exile prisoners and separate them from the general population by placing them in a remote location, often an island or distant colonial territory. Although the term can be used to refer to a correctional facility located in a remote location, it is more commonly used to refer to communities of prisoners overseen by wardens or governors having absolute authority.

Historically, penal colonies have often been used for penal labour in an economically underdeveloped part of a state&#x27;s (usually colonial) territories, and on a far larger scale than a prison farm.

==British Empire==

With the passage of the &quot;Transportation Act 1717&quot;, the British government initiated the penal transportation of indentured servants to Britain&#x27;s colonies in the Americas, although none of the North American colonies were solely penal colonies. British merchants would be in charge of transporting the convicts across the Atlantic to the colonies where they would be auctioned off to planters. Many of the indentured servants were sentenced to seven-year terms, which gave rise to the colloquial term &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Seven-Year Passengers&quot;. It is estimated that between 1718 and 1776 about 30,000 convicts were transported to at least nine of the continental colonies, whereas between 1700 and 1775 about 250,000 to 300,000 white immigrants came to mainland North America as a whole. More than two-thirds of these felons were transported to the Chesapeake to work for Southern landowners; in Maryland, during the thirty years before 1776, convicts composed more than one-quarter of all immigrants. However, it is commonly maintained that the vast majority of felons taken to America were political criminals, not those guilty of social crimes such as theft; for example, it was noted of Virginia that &quot;the crimes of which they were convicted were chiefly political, and the number transported for social crimes was never considerable.&quot; The colony of Georgia, by contrast, was planned by James Oglethorpe specifically to take in debtors and other social criminals. Oglethorpe referred to them as &quot;the worthy poor&quot; in a philanthropic effort to create a rehabilitative colony where prisoners could earn a second chance at life, learning trades and working off their debts. The success of Oglethorpe&#x27;s vision is debated.

When routes to the Americas closed after the outbreak of American Revolutionary War in 1776, British prisons started to become overcrowded. Since immediate stopgap measures proved themselves ineffective, in 1785 Britain decided to use parts of what is now known as Australia as &quot;de jure&quot; penal settlements, becoming the first colonies in the British Empire founded solely to house convicts. Leaving Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787, the First Fleet transported the first ~800 convicts and ~250 marines to Botany Bay. Between 1788 and 1868, about 162,000 convicts were transported from Great Britain and Ireland to various penal colonies in Australia. Australian penal colonies in late 18th century included Norfolk Island and New South Wales, and in early 19th century also Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) and Moreton Bay (Queensland).

Among the 162,000 convicts sent to Colonial Australia were 3,600 political prisoners. This included a range of dissenters, including the Tolpuddle Martyrs, Luddites, and members of Irish nationalist groups such as the Society of United Irishmen and Young Ireland.

Without the allocation of the available convict labour to farmers, to pastoral squatters, and to government projects such as roadbuilding, colonisation of Australia may not have been possible, especially considering the considerable drain on non-convict labor caused by several gold rushes that took place in the second half of the 19th century after the flow of convicts had dwindled and (in 1868) ceased. A proposal to make the Cape Colony a penal colony was deeply unpopular with local residents, sparking the Convict crisis of 1849.

Bermuda, off the North American continent, was also used during the Victorian period. Convicts housed in hulks were used to build the Royal Naval Dockyard there, and during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), Boer prisoners-of-war were sent to the archipelago and imprisoned on one of the smaller islands.

In British India, the colonial government established various penal colonies. Two of the largest ones were on the Andaman Islands and Hijli. In the early days of settlement, Singapore Island was the recipient of Indian convicts, who were tasked with clearing the jungles for settlement and early public works.

==France==
France sent criminals to tropical penal colonies including Louisiana in the early 18th century. Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana, received some 80,000 forgers and other criminals between 1852 and 1939. At its worst the mortality rate was 75%, earning it the nicknamed the &#x27;Dry Guillotine&#x27;. New Caledonia and its Isle of Pines in Melanesia (in the South Sea) received transported dissidents like the Communards, Kabyles rebels and convicted criminals between the 1860s and 1897.

==Americas==

* Brazil had a prison on the island of Fernando de Noronha from 1938 to 1945.
* Gorgona Island in Colombia housed a state high-security prison from the 1950s. Convicts were dissuaded from escaping by the venomous snakes in the interior of the island and by the sharks patrolling the 30 km to the mainland. The penal colony closed in 1984 and the last prisoners were transferred to the mainland. most of the former jail buildings are covered by dense vegetation, but some remain visible.
* Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba is used by the United States as a penal colony.
* Mexico uses the island of Isla María Madre (in the Marías Islands) as a penal colony. With a small population (fewer than 1,200), the colony is governed by a state official who is both the governor of the islands and chief judge. The military command is independent of the government and is exercised by an officer of the Mexican Navy. The other islands are uninhabited. Mexico announced on 18 February 2019 that it will close the Islas Marías Federal Prison, replacing it with a new cultural center.
* During the 19th century Chile used Fuerte Bulnes and Punta Arenas on the Strait of Magellan as a penal colony (1844–1852).
* Ecuador has used two islands in the Galápagos archipelago as penal colonies: the Island of San Cristóbal (1869–1904) and Isabela Island (1945–1959).
* Paraguay&#x27;s first ruler and supreme dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia opened the penal colony of Tevego in 1813, where mostly petty criminals were sent. It was abandoned in 1823, but re-established in 1843 as San Salvador. It was evacuated towards the end of the Paraguayan War of 1864–1870; soon afterwards Brazilian troops destroyed it.
*Argentina had a penal colony in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, in the Patagonia region. It was active between 1902 and 1947.
*Once Spanish presence in Valdivia was reestablished in 1645 authorities had convicts from all-over the Viceroyalty of Peru construct the Valdivian Fort System. The convicts, many of whom were Afro-Peruvians, became later soldier-settlers. Close contacts with indigenous Mapuche meant many soldiers spoke Spanish and had some command of Mapudungun.

==Elsewhere==
* Following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of modern day Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was used as a penal colony. Today, 18% of the population of Peshawar has Greek genetic markers.
* The Meiji Government of Japan used Abashiri Prison in Abashiri, Hokkaido as a penal colony in 1890. The prison later turned into an ordinary jail in 1894.
* The Qing Empire of 1636–1912 used general-ruled provinces Jilin (Ningguta) in north-east China and Xinjiang in north-west China as penal colonies.
* Imperial Russia used Siberia and Russian Far East for penal colonies (katorga) for criminals and dissidents. Though geographically contiguous with heartland Russia, Siberia provided both remoteness and a harsh climate. In 1857 a penal colony was established on the island of Sakhalin. The Soviet Gulag system and its tsarist predecessor, the katorga system, provided penal labor to develop forestry, logging, and mining industries, construction enterprises, as well as highways and railroads across Siberia and in other areas. In the modern Russian Federation, corrective labor colonies are a common type of prison.
* The Kingdom of Hawaii under the rule of King Kamehameha III (reigned 1825–1854) replaced the death penalty with exile, and Kahoolawe became a men&#x27;s penal colony sometime around 1830, while Kaena Point on Lanai served as the female penal colony. The law making the island a penal colony was repealed in 1853.
* Boven Digoel in Papua was once used by Dutch East Indies authorities as penal colony for revolutionaries.
* Buru Island in Indonesia was used as a penal colony during the New Order era to hold political prisoners.
* Apartheid South Africa used Robben Island as a penal colony for anti-apartheid activists.
* The Netherlands had a penal colony from the late 19th century. The Department of Justice took over the town of Veenhuizen (originally set up by a private company to &quot;re-educate&quot; vagrants from the large cities in the west like Amsterdam) to turn it into a collection of prison buildings. The town stands in the least populated province of Drenthe in the north of the country, isolated in the middle of a vast area of peat and marshland.
* Some sources refer to Nazi-era forced-labor camps (&quot;Arbeitslager&quot;) in German-occupied Europe as penal colonies.
* North Korea operates a penal system including prison labor camps and re-education camps.
* Tarrafal operated as a Portuguese penal colony in the Cape Verde Islands, set up in 1936 by the head of the Portuguese government, Salazar, where opponents of this right-wing regime were sent. At least 32 anarchists, communists and other opponents of Salazar&#x27;s regime died in this camp. The camp closed in 1954 but re-opened in the 1970s to jail African leaders fighting Portuguese colonialism.

* Spain maintained a penal colony on Fernando Po in present-day Equatorial Guinea. The tiny island of Cabrera was also a short-lived penal colony in which approximately 7,000 French prisoners of war from the Battle of Bailén (1808) were left on their own for years; less than half of them survived.
* Taiwan had a penal colony at Green Island during Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s White Terror of 1949–1987. , the island is a tourist destination.
* Côn Đảo Island in Vietnam was used as a penal colony both by the French colonists (from 1861 onwards) and by the Republic of Vietnam (from 1954 and during the Vietnam War of 1955–1975).
* The Ottoman Empire used Fezzan as a penal colony, because it was the most remote province from the then capital city, Istanbul.
* There are penal colonies in the Philippines, namely Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm in Palawan, and Davao Prison and Penal Farm in Davao.

<text>In military operations, military reconnaissance or scouting is the exploration of an area by military forces to obtain information about enemy forces, the terrain, and civil activities in the area of operations. In military jargon, reconnaissance is abbreviated to &quot;recce&quot; (in British, Canadian, Australian English) and to &quot;recon&quot; (in American English), both derived from the root word &quot;reconnoitre&quot; / &quot;reconnoitering&quot;. 

The types of reconnaissance include patrolling the local area of operations and long-range reconnaissance patrols, which are tasks usually realized in the United States of America by U.S. Army Rangers, cavalry scouts, and military intelligence specialists, using navy ships and submarines, reconnaissance aircraft, satellites to collect raw intelligence; and establishing observation posts. Moreover, espionage is different from reconnaissance, because spies work as civilians in enemy territory.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Middle French word &quot;reconoissance&quot;.

==Overview==

Reconnaissance conducted by ground forces includes special reconnaissance, armored reconnaissance, amphibious reconnaissance and civil reconnaissance.

Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance carried out by aircraft (of all types including balloons and uncrewed aircraft). The purpose is to survey weather conditions, map terrain, and may include military purposes such as observing tangible structures, particular areas, and movement of enemy forces.

Naval forces use aerial and satellite reconnaissance to observe enemy forces. Navies also undertake hydrographic surveys and intelligence gathering.

Reconnaissance satellites provide military commanders with photographs of enemy forces and other intelligence. Military forces also use geographical and meteorological information from Earth observation satellites.

== Discipline ==
Types of reconnaissance:

* &quot;Terrain-oriented&quot; reconnaissance is a survey of the terrain (its features, weather, and other natural observations).
* &quot;Force-oriented&quot; reconnaissance focuses on the enemy forces (number, equipment, activities, disposition etc.) and may include target acquisition.
* &quot;Civil-oriented&quot; reconnaissance focuses on the civil dimension of the battlespace (areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people and events abbreviated ASCOPE).

The techniques and objectives are not mutually exclusive; it is up to the commander whether they are carried out separately or by the same unit.

=== Reconnaissance-in-force ===

Reconnaissance-in-force (RIF) is a type of military operation or military tactic used specifically to probe an enemy&#x27;s combat ability.

While typical reconnaissance forces are small and armed only for self-defense, RIF use considerable (but not decisive) force in order to elicit a strong reaction by the enemy that more accurately reveals its own strength, deployment, preparedness, determination, and other tactical data. The RIF units can then fall back and report this data, or expand the conflict into a full engagement if enemy weaknesses are revealed.

Other methods consist of hit-and-run tactics using rapid mobility, and in some cases light-armored vehicles for added fire superiority, as the need arises.

Maintaining active RIF can be used to limit, or even deny, enemy reconnaissance.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s reconnaissance during World War II is described in the following way:

The purpose of reconnaissance and the types of units employed to obtain information are similar in the U.S. and the German Armies. German tactical principles of reconnaissance, however, diverge somewhat from those of the U.S. The Germans stress aggressiveness, attempt to obtain superiority in the area to be reconnoitered, and strive for continuous observation of the enemy. They believe in employing reconnaissance units in force as a rule. They expect and are prepared to fight to obtain the desired information. Often they assign supplementary tasks to their reconnaissance units, such as sabotage behind enemy lines, harassment, or counter-reconnaissance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only enough reconnaissance troops are sent on a mission to assure superiority in the area to be reconnoitred. Reserves are kept on hand to be committed when the reconnaissance must be intensified, when the original force meets strong enemy opposition, or when the direction and area to be reconnoitred are changed. The Germans encourage aggressive action against enemy security forces. When their reconnaissance units meet superior enemy forces, they fight a delaying action while other units attempt to flank the enemy.

=== Reconnaissance-by-fire ===

Reconnaissance-by-fire (or &quot;speculative fire&quot;) is the act of firing at likely enemy positions to cause the enemy force to reveal their location by moving or by returning fire.

=== Reconnaissance-pull ===
Reconnaissance-pull is a tactic that is applied at the regiment to division level and defined as locating and rapidly exploiting enemy weaknesses. It is the ability to determine enemy positions and create exploitable gaps through which friendly forces can pass while avoiding obstacles and strong points.

A textbook example of reconnaissance-pull was documented during the Tinian landings of World War II, utilized by the United States Marine Corps&#x27;s Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, from V Amphibious Corps. Aerial photography and the confirmation by the amphibious reconnaissance platoons determined that the Japanese defenders had largely ignored the northern beaches of the island, focusing most of their defensive effort on beaches in the south-west which were more favorable for an amphibious landing. American forces quickly changed their landing location to the northern beaches and planned a small and hasty &quot;deception&quot; operation off the southern beach, which resulted in a complete surprise for the Japanese forces. As a result, American forces were able to fight the Japanese force on land, where they had the advantage, leading to light losses and a relatively short battle that lasted only 9 days.

==Types==

When referring to reconnaissance, a commander&#x27;s full intention is to have a vivid picture of his battlespace. The commander organizes the reconnaissance platoon based on:

# mission,
# enemy,
# terrain,
# troops and support available,
# time available, and
# civil considerations.

This analysis determines whether the platoon uses single or multiple elements to conduct the reconnaissance, whether it pertains to area, zone, or route reconnaissance, the following techniques may be used as long as the fundamentals of reconnaissance are applied.

Scouts may also have different tasks to perform for their commanders of higher echelons, for example: the engineer reconnaissance detachments will try to identify difficult terrain in the path of their formation, and attempt to reduce the time it takes to transit the terrain using specialist engineering equipment such as a pontoon bridge for crossing water obstacles. Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance implies collection and transfer of all data available on sanitary and epidemiological situation of the area of possible deployment and action of armed forces, the same data for the neighboring and enemy armed forces. The aim for the reconnaissance is to clear up the reasons of the specific disease origin- sources of the infection in various extreme situations, including local wars and armed conflicts, the ways of the infection transfer and all factors promoting to the infestation.

After the armed forces have become stationary during wartime and emergency of peacetime the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological surveillance and medical control of vital and communal activity of the armed forces.

===Area===

Area reconnaissance refers to the observation, and information obtained, about a specified location and the area around it; it may be terrain-oriented and/or force-oriented. Ideally, a reconnaissance platoon, or team, would use surveillance or vantage (static) points around the objective to observe, and the surrounding area. This methodology focuses mainly prior to moving forces into or near a specified area; the military commander may utilize his reconnaissance assets to conduct an area reconnaissance to avoid being surprised by unsuitable terrain conditions, or most importantly, unexpected enemy forces. The area could be a town, ridge-line, woods, or another feature that friendly forces intend to occupy, pass through, or avoid.

Within an area of operation (AO), area reconnaissance can focus the reconnaissance on the specific area that is critical to the commander. This technique of focusing the reconnaissance also permits the mission to be accomplished more quickly. Area reconnaissance can thus be a stand-alone mission or a task to a section or the platoon. The commander analyzes the mission to determine whether the platoon will conduct these types of reconnaissance separately or in conjunction with each other.

===Civil===
Civil reconnaissance is the process of gathering a broad spectrum of civil information about a specific population in support of military operations. It is related to and often performed in conjunction with infrastructure reconnaissance (assessment and survey). Normally the focus of collection in the operational area for civil reconnaissance is collecting civil information relating to the daily interaction between civilians and military forces. Civil information encompasses relational, temporal, geospatial and behavioral information captured in a socio-cultural backdrop. It is information developed from data related to civil areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events, within the civil component of the commander&#x27;s operational environment that can be processed to increase situational awareness and understanding. The type of civil information that is needed in order to support military operations varies based on the environment and situation.

===Route===

Route reconnaissance is oriented on a given route (e.g., a road, a railway, a waterway; i.e., a narrow axis or a general direction of attack) to provide information on route conditions or activities along the route. A military commander relies on information about locations along his determined route: which of those that would provide best cover and concealment; bridge by construction type, dimensions, and classification; or for landing zones or pickup zones, if the need arises.

In many cases, the commander may act upon a &quot;force-oriented&quot; route reconnaissance by which the enemy could influence movement along that route. For the reconnaissance platoons, or squads, stealth and speed—in conjunction with detailed intelligence-reporting—are most important and crucial. The reconnaissance platoon must remain far enough ahead of the maneuver force to assist in early warning and to prevent the force from becoming surprised.

It is paramount to obtain information about the available space in which a force can maneuver without being forced to bunch up due to obstacles. &quot;Terrain-oriented&quot; route reconnaissance allows the commander to obtain information and capabilities about the adjacent terrain for maneuvering his forces, to include, any obstacles (minefields, barriers, steep ravines, marshy areas, or chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination) that may obstruct vehicle movement—on routes to, and in, his assigned area of operations. This requirement includes the size of trees and the density of forests due to their effects on vehicle movement. Route reconnaissance also allows the observation for fields of fire along the route and adjacent terrain. This information assists planners as a supplement to map information.

===Zone===
Zone reconnaissance focuses on obtaining detailed information before maneuvering their forces through particular, designated locations. It can be terrain-oriented, force-oriented, or both, as it acquire this information by reconnoitering within—and by maintaining surveillance over—routes, obstacles (to include nuclear-radiological, biological, and chemical contamination), and resources within an assigned location.

Also, &quot;force-oriented&quot; zone reconnaissance is assigned to gain detailed information about enemy forces within the zone, or when the enemy situation is vague by which the information concerning cross-country traffic-ability is desired. The reconnaissance provides the commander with a detailed picture of how the enemy has occupied the zone, enabling him to choose the appropriate course-of-action.

As the platoon conducts this type of zone reconnaissance, its emphasis is on determining the enemy&#x27;s locations, strengths, and weaknesses. This is the most thorough and complete reconnaissance mission and therefore is very time-intensive.

== Psychology ==
A tracker needs to pay close attention to both the environment and the psychology of their enemy. Knowledge of human psychology, sociology, and cultural backgrounds is necessary to know the actions of the enemy and what they will do or where they will go next. Chief of Scouts Frederick Russell Burnham commented on reconnaissance and scouts, saying:

It is imperative that a scout should know the history, tradition, religion, social customs, and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among. This is almost as necessary as to know the physical character of the country, its climate and products. Certain people will do certain things almost without fail. Certain other things, perfectly feasible, they will not do. There is no danger of knowing too much of the mental habits of an enemy. One should neither underestimate the enemy nor credit him with superhuman powers. Fear and courage are latent in every human being, though roused into activity by very diverse means.

<text>Homebrewing is the brewing of beer or other alcoholic beverages on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes. Supplies, such as kits and fermentation tanks, can be purchased locally at specialty stores or online. Beer was brewed domestically for thousands of years before its commercial production although its legality has varied according to local regulation. Homebrewing is closely related to the hobby of &quot;home distillation&quot;, the production of alcoholic spirits for personal consumption, but home distillation is generally more tightly regulated.

==History==

Beer has been brewed domestically throughout its 7,000-year history, beginning in the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Egypt and China. It seems to have first developed as thick beers; during this time meads, fruit wines and rice wines were also developed.

Women brewers dominated alcohol production on every occupied continent until commercialization and industrialization of brewing occurred. The tradition of brewing being in the domain of women stemmed from the fact that brewing was a by-product of gathering, and often considered a part of baking.

The Greeks and Romans cultivated both grape wine and beer, to a lesser extent. Roman women often directed production in larger households while the labor was performed by slaves.

By the Tang dynasty, homebrewing seems to have been a familiar domestic chore in China, albeit the lower classes had to make do with poorly-filtered mash. Laws against making alcohol were enacted and repealed between the Zhou and Ming dynasties.

The 18th century Industrial Revolution brought about such innovations as the thermometer and hydrometer. These tools increased efficiency to the point that mass production of beer was possible for the first time in history. In 1857, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur explained the role of yeast in beer fermentation, allowing brewers to develop strains of yeast with desirable properties such as efficiency converting sugar to alcohol and ability to handle higher alcohol content.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, homebrewing in the UK was circumscribed by taxation: the Inland Revenue Act 1880 (43 &amp; 44 Vict. c. 20) introduced a 5-shilling homebrewing licence. Chancellor of the Exchequer Reginald Maudling removed the requirement for a brewing licence in 1963. Australia followed suit in 1972 when Gough Whitlam repealed the law prohibiting the brewing of all but the weakest beers in one of his first acts as Prime Minister.

In 1920, Prohibition caused breweries across the United States to be closed down or to begin making malt for other purposes. The homebrewing of beer with an alcohol content higher than 0.5% remained illegal until 1978 when Congress passed a bill repealing federal restrictions and excise taxes, and President Jimmy Carter signed the bill, &quot;H.R. 1337&quot;, into law, legalizing homebrewing of beer in the United States. Within months of homebrewing&#x27;s full legalization, Charlie Papazian founded the Brewers Association and American Homebrewers Association. In 1984, Papazian published &quot;The Complete Joy of Home Brewing&quot;, which remains in print alongside later publications, such as Graham Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;Home Brewing: The CAMRA Guide&quot;.

==Brewing culture==
People choose to brew their own beer for a variety of reasons. Many homebrew to avoid a higher cost of buying commercially equivalent beverages. Brewing domestically also affords one the freedom to adjust recipes according to one&#x27;s own preference, create beverages that are unavailable on the open market or beverages that may contain fewer calories, or less or more alcohol.

Some people join homebrewing clubs and enter homebrew competitions. The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) is an American organization that oversees homebrew competitions, certifies judges, and offers categories for judging. Similar British organizations are The National Guild of Wine and Beer Judges,
and the National Association of Wine and Beermakers (Amateur) - (NAWB), who have held an annual show since 1959.

==Legality==

== Homebrewing kits ==
Homebrewing kits come in many different types and from many different manufacturers. A local homebrew store may create some of their own kits by packaging materials together. Most kits come with a full set of instructions for brewing. These instructions, sometimes called recipes, may vary widely in the amount of instruction given. For instance, many all-grain kits assume a familiarity with the brewing process and so may give fewer specific instructions on the general process. Many advanced brewers prefer to design and perfect their own recipes rather than buy kits. Kits may or may not include yeast.

===All-grain===
For brewers with equipment and advanced knowledge about the brewing process, all-grain kits include all the ingredients necessary to create homebrew beer. Most kits include grain and hops, some kits may also include yeast that pairs well with the style of beer. A full set of instructions is generally included. What sets these kits apart from others is the inclusion of malted grain which must first undergo a mash to extract the sugars. This combination of liquid and sugars is known as wort (pronounced &quot;wert&quot;) and is necessary for fermentation. A full boil of the wort is then required, with one or more hop additions at different times depending on style. A typical brew session using all-grain takes between 4 and 6 hours, not including fermentation.

===Malt extract===
Some kits contain a concentrated malt extract rather than grain. Malt extract can be either dry or in a syrup form, both used to produce fermented syrup. A few advanced kits may also come with a small amount of milled, malted grain that must be steeped with the wort before boiling. A grain bag is usually included to facilitate this process. These additional grains help add different character to the beer so that a single extract can be used to brew several varieties of beer. A full boil is required, with hop additions at different times depending on style. A typical brew session using extract typically takes 2 hours, not including fermentation.

===Pre-hopped malt extract===
Sometimes known as beer in a can, no-boil, and hopped wort, these beer kits contain liquid malt extract that has already been boiled with hops to introduce bitterness and flavor. Pre-hopped kits simplify the brewing process by removing the need to add hops at specific times during the boil. Some kits may not require a boil at all, but that may increase the risk of off flavors in the resulting beer from contamination from bacteria and wild yeasts. While some feel the quality of beer from these kits can be on par with commercial beer or homebrew made from other methods, others feel that pre-hopped extract provides hop bitterness with little flavor and bouquet. A typical brew session using pre-hopped ingredients may take less than an hour, not including fermentation.

===Brew in a bag===
Brew in a bag (BIAB) is a simplified all-grain technique developed in Australia. The main pioneer and continuing authority on this method is Patrick Hollingdale. The hallmarks of BIAB are a single brewing vessel, a fine mesh bag to hold the grist (crushed malt/grain) and a single heat source. The bag, usually made of nylon or fashioned out of a voile material lines the brewing pot which contains the total volume of water needed for the entire brewing process. The water is then heated to strike temperature and then the grist is added. The traditional brewing technique of sparging (rinsing the grains) is skipped and after the mashing period is complete (typically 60–90 minutes) the grain bag holding the spent grains is removed (lautering) and the bag is compressed to drain the wort from the grain ball. The all-grain brewing process then proceeds as normal: boiling, cooling, pitching and fermenting. Traditional mashing methods require three vessels and at least two heat sources. Brew in a bag has revolutionised home all-grain brewing as batch sizes of of wort into the fermenter are easily employed without any compromising on quality or versatility. A typical brew session using BIAB is typically 3 hours, not including fermentation.

===Ingredients outside the kits===
====Water====
Cold water is preferred for the yeast for its high oxygen content.

====Sucrose====
Some homebrewing kits usually instruct that a tablespoon of sucrose should be added per bottle.

==Brewing process==

The principles behind the process of homebrewing beer are similar to commercial brewing. A hopped wort is produced and yeast pitched into the wort to stimulate fermentation. The complexity of the process is mostly determined by the approach used to manufacture the wort; by far the simplest method is kit brewing.

=== Mashing ===

Mashing is the step required to convert starch in the grains into sugar by utilizing natural enzymes. This step varies depending on the skill of the home brewer.

==== Beginners ====

For extract brewing, the mashing has been done by the supplier of the malt extract. No mashing is required for the home brewer in this instance.

==== Intermediate brewers ====

A partial mash differs from an extract brew in that the extract remains enzymatically active. Unlike dead malts where some of the starch has been converted to sugar via the action of heat and the natural enzymes have been destroyed, wheat and unmalted extracts need the help of enzymes to convert their starches into sugars.

The next step up from extract brewing is to use a diastatically active malt extract to convert starches from other beer adjuncts such as flaked and torrified barleys, flaked and torrified wheat, wheat flour, and flaked oats into fermented syrup. These extracts are currently only available in the canned form. Unmalted barleys and wheats can add extra &quot;body&quot; to a finished beer.

==== Advanced brewers ====

Advanced homebrewers forgo the use of concentrated extract and instead convert starch into sugars from the grains themselves in a process often referred to as all grain brewing. Although considered an advanced method, all grain brewing is easily achievable by beginners and with rudimentary equipment, especially when using the BIAB method. 

In all grain brewing the wort is made by making a mash from crushed malted barley (or alternative grain adjuncts such as unmalted barley, wheat, oats, corn or rye) and hot water. This requires a vessel known as a mash tun, which is often insulated, or can be done in a single brewing vessel if the homebrewer is using the BIAB method. 

In one procedure popular with homebrewers called the &quot;Infusion Mash&quot;, milled grains are combined in the tun and hot water is added. Before being combined with the grains, the water is heated to a temperature that is hotter than the desired temperature for enzymatic activity. The reason the water is heated is to compensate for the fact that the grain are cooler than the desired temperature.

The grains are infused with yet hotter water to rinse more sugars from the mash in a process known as sparging. There are two types of sparging. Fly sparging and batch sparging. Fly sparging involves rinsing the grain bed by adding small amounts of hot water to the top while draining equal amounts from the bottom. Batch sparging involves adding all or most of your sparge water at one time to the grain bed and slowly draining it from the bottom. The sparging process will also stop any further enzymatic activity if much hotter water is used; conversely the mash may be heated to around to end such activity prior to placing it in the lauter-tun, and to prevent cooler grain from lowering the sparge water temperature to a lower than desirable figure.

==== Boiling the wort ====
Whether the homebrewer chooses to mash their own grains or chooses to purchase malt extracts, the homebrewer will then need to boil the liquid and add hops. The length of time the wort boils with the hops varies depending on the style of beer, but is usually 60–90 minutes.

Hops are added at different times during the boil, depending on the desired result. Hops added at the beginning of the boil contribute bitterness, hops added in the last thirty minutes contribute flavor. Hops added in the last few minutes or even after the end of the boil contribute both flavor and hop aroma. These hop additions are generally referred to as bittering, flavor, and aroma additions respectively.

Finings such as Irish moss, a form of seaweed, gelatin, and others can be added in the final 15–30 minutes of the boil to help prevent haze in the resulting beer.

==== Cooling the wort ====
The primary reason to cool the wort is to get the wort to the proper temperature for healthy yeast propagation. Other benefits of rapidly cooling of the wort include &quot;locking in&quot; hop flavor and aroma, aiding in the production of &quot;cold break&quot; where haze-producing proteins coagulate ultimately resulting in a clearer beer, slowing the production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and hindering the growth of wort contamination by pitching yeast as soon as possible.

Many homebrewers use an inexpensive wort chiller called an &quot;immersion chiller.&quot; These resemble the &quot;worms&quot; used in distilleries consisting of a coiled length of copper or stainless steel tubing (typically 50 feet in length) with an inlet and outlet connection. The inlet is attached to a source of cool water such as a sink faucet. The immersion chiller is inserted into the hot wort then cool water pumped is through the coil where a heat exchange occurs thus lowering the temperature of the wort.

Many homebrewers also use a &quot;counterflow chiller.&quot; This device consists of a tube of copper or stainless steel tubing nested inside a larger diameter length of tube. It resembles an immersion chiller but works more like plate chiller in that hot wort is circulated through the inner tube and cool water is passed through the outer tube counter to the direction of the hot wort, thereby cooling the wort quickly.

Some homebrewers use the &#x27;no-chill&#x27; approach. It is a water-conserving technique, depending on the ambient temperature being lower to cool the hot wort. After the boil the hot wort is racked into a fitting fermenter. After placing the cap or the lid, the fermenter is tumbled slightly to let the hot wort sanitise all internal surfaces. It then will be left alone (often overnight) until it has reached pitching temperatures, what may take up to the best part of a day. Contamination should not be an issue since near-boiling wort is a very effective sanitiser. Where the desired outcome is to capture wild yeast from the air, some homebrewers leave the wort to cool in a broad, uncovered container, typically called a coolship.

==== Fermentation ====
Once the wort has cooled to a temperature that is friendly to yeast, the yeast is &quot;pitched&quot; into the wort and allowed to ferment. It is at this point that &#x27;wort&quot; becomes &quot;beer.&quot; Primary fermentation in homebrewing takes place in large glass or plastic carboys or food-grade plastic buckets, nearly always sealed. When sealed, the fermenter is stoppered with a fermentation lock, which allows the carbon dioxide gas produced to vent, while preventing other gasses and particles from entering. Recent innovations in nanotechnology have enabled a fermentation lock called the Sterilock to also prevent bacteria, wild yeasts and other potential harmful fungi reaching the fermenter although in some beer styles known as Sour Beer, bacteria or wild yeasts are desirable to obtain the sour characteristics. During this time, temperatures should be kept at optimum temperature for the particular yeast strain being used. For ale this temperature is usually ;
 for lager it is usually much colder, around . A vigorous fermentation then takes place, usually starting within twelve hours and continuing over the next few days. During this stage, the fermentable sugars (maltose, glucose, and sucrose) are consumed by the yeast, while ethanol and carbon dioxide are produced as byproducts by the yeast. A layer of sediment, the lees or &quot;trub&quot;, appears at the bottom of the fermenter, composed of heavy fats, proteins and inactive yeast. This yeast is sometimes reused in subsequent batches. Often, the brew is moved to a second fermenting vessel after primary fermentation called a secondary fermenter. This secondary fermentation process is often utilized by more advanced home brewers to enhance flavor. While not required, it is generally practiced by home brewers who wish to age or clarify their beer by removing it from the sediment left behind by primary fermentation, often through the addition of isinglass, colloidal silicon dioxide, or spakolloid. In addition to using two different fermenting containers, some home brewers may choose to only use one container in which primary and secondary fermentation take place. This container is usually referred to as a uni-tank. Uni-tanks are usually conical in shape, and can be made from plastic, glass, or stainless steel. A popular plastic conical for homebrewing is FastFerment, while a popular stainless steel conical fermenter for homebrewers is The Blichmann Fermenator.

==== Carbonation ====
Upon conclusion of fermentation, the beer is carbonated before it is consumed. This is typically done in one of two ways; force carbonation in a keg using compressed carbon dioxide, or bottle carbonation with priming sugar. Any bottle that is able to withstand the pressure of carbonation can be used, such as used beer bottles, flip-top bottles with rubber stoppers such as Grolsch, or even plastic bottles such as soda bottles, provided they are properly sanitised. Priming briefly reactivates the yeast that remains in the bottle, carbonating the brew. Homebrewed beers and lagers are typically unfiltered (filtering improves visual appearance of the product, but complicates carbonation). Bottled beer becomes clear quicker than kegged beer, since the yeast does not have as far to descend.


In homebrewing, adding priming sugar, malt extract, or carbonation tablets at bottling time to beer that has had its fermentable sugar content totally consumed is the safest approach to carbonation. Exceeding recommended levels of priming sugar for a given recipe can result in exploding bottles (aka &quot;bottle bombs&quot;), as is using inappropriate bottles or improper capping methods. Beer may also be force-carbonated using a keg and special bottling equipment so that the carbonation level can be carefully controlled. Carbonation is often achieved with approximately of corn sugar boiled in 2 cups (500 mL) of water then cooled and added to a typical batch before bottling.

==Kegs==
Homebrewers often use kegs for aging, filtering, and storing beer. These are seldom the standard kegs used by major brewers to transport draught beer to wholesalers, but instead are reconditioned Cornelius kegs (colloquially known as &quot;corny kegs&quot; or &quot;cornies&quot;) that were originally manufactured to store soda; these vessels are much easier to fill, clean and maintain than standard beer kegs.

These kegs are stainless steel cylinders that hold approximately of liquid. The keg is filled with liquid via a removable hatch on the top, which is then closed and sealed. Carbon dioxide is added to pressurize the keg via an inlet port on the top and is facilitated by gently rocking the brew back and forth. Liquid is dispensed via an outlet port attached to a tube that extends to the bottom of the keg. Pin-lock and ball-lock fittings (or &quot;posts&quot;) are the two types of couplings used on the inlet and outlet ports. Coke distributors used pin-lock fittings, while Pepsi distributors used ball-lock fittings. Ball-lock are most frequently encountered. The pin-lock style is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Coke&quot; keg or style and the ball-lock is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Pepsi&quot; keg or style though the fittings themselves are removable, serviceable, and contain interchangeable parts.

Homebrewers sometimes use commercial kegs (known as 1/2 kegs) for boiling vessels in creating wort. The kegs are drilled for a drain at the bottom, and the top cut open to create a large stainless steel cooking kettle. Many times, the piece of metal cut out of the top is re-used to create a false bottom for straining wort during the mashing process, as well as to strain the boiled wort when adding hops without using a mesh grain bag.

Alternatively, kegs specifically designed for home brewing are available. The capacity may be matched to commercial extract brewing kits; typically 12 and 23 litres. Smaller kegs are also made for ease of transporting to a function.

Kegs may have residual pressure, and this must be vented to avoid having the valve explode and injure or kill a person as the valve shoots out. Conventional kegs have circle spring clips that can be removed to release the tap valve. Some kegs such as those used by Miller have threaded valves that are threaded into the keg, and after venting, can be opened by turning the valve counterclockwise using a piece of metal inserted between the valve ears and turned with an adjustable wrench, or pipe wrench. A &quot;wonderbar&quot; type of pry bar just happens to fit. After the valve is loose it is still retained by a safety catch that must be pried inward. A simple valve seal depressing tool and a screwdriver with a diameter shaft must be used to release the safety catch. See &quot;How to remove a Miller threaded keg valve (not retained by a spiral ring)&quot;. The safety catch prevents the valve from releasing under pressure.

It is not recommended that kegs be sanitised with bleach. To avoid unpleasant residuals, kegs are sanitised with an iodine- or oxygen-based sanitiser. Sanitisers like Star-San and B-Brite are commonly used. The ball lock valves may be unscrewed using wrenches to allow further cleaning or replacement of O-rings or poppet valves.

==Environmental impact==
Homebrewing can reduce the environmental impact of fermented beverages by using less packaging and transportation than commercially brewed beverages, and by the use of refillable jugs, reusable bottles or other reusable containers.

== Brewing software and technology ==

Brewers now have access to a variety of software tools, whether free/open source or commercial, which allow them to formulate and adjust recipes. There are also web based recipe creation and sharing sites with extensive recipe databases contributed by users that can be viewed or downloaded for printing or importation into software using BeerXML. More traditional Internet forums continue to provide brewers with sources of advice and information from their peers all over the world.

== Homebrewing competitions ==
Homebrewers can submit their beer for evaluation into competitions. These competitions provide blind feed back to brewers so they can get objective feedback, make adjustments to improve their brewing, and be recognized for outstanding homebrew. Competitions can be organized by homebrew clubs, state fairs, or businesses. The AHA, BJCP, and HomebrewCompetitions.com all keep a list of currently scheduled competitions. Homebrewcompetitions.com is a free resource for homebrewers and homebrew competition organizers.

The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) trains and certifies beer judges through classes and tasting and written tests. BJCP judges evaluate the beer on 5 criteria: Aroma, Appearance, Flavor, Mouthfeel, and Overall Impression. The beer is also compared to a style provided by the brewer and described in the BJCP Style Guidelines.

The Polish Homebrewer&#x27;s Association (PSPD) has developed their own guidelines for beer competition judging and trains judges for competitions in Poland. A list of competitions is available on their website.

<doc id="146919" wikidata="Q694002" url="?curid=146919" title="Orthodox Church in America">
<text>The Orthodox Church in America (OCA) is an Eastern Orthodox Christian church based in North America. The OCA consists of more than 700 parishes, missions, communities, monasteries and institutions in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In 2011, it had an estimated 84,900 members in the United States.

The OCA has its origins in a mission established by eight Russian Orthodox monks in Alaska, then part of Russian America, in 1794. This grew into a full diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. By the late 19th century, the Russian Orthodox Church had grown in other areas of the United States due to the arrival of immigrants from areas of Eastern and Central Europe, many of them formerly of the Eastern Catholic Churches (&quot;Greek Catholics&quot;), and from the Middle East. These immigrants, regardless of nationality or ethnic background, were united under a single North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church.

After the Bolshevik Revolution, Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches outside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously. Orthodox churches in America became a self-governing Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America in 1924 under the leadership of Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky), popularly called the Metropolia (from ). The Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America was granted autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970, and renamed the Orthodox Church in America. Its hierarchs are part of the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America. While the OCA is in full communion with most Eastern Orthodox churches in the world, the OCA&#x27;s autocephaly is not fully recognized.

Unlike most Orthodox jurisdictions in the United States, the OCA does not have an affinity towards any particular foreign nationality, but most OCA members are ethnically Euro-American, and most OCA clergy are those who are born and raised in the United States. However, the OCA does have other minority ethnic dioceses for Romanian, Bulgarian, and Albanian immigrants. Additionally, as a consequence of history, certain ethnic groups (particularly Russian Americans, Ruthenian Americans and Alaska Natives) are disproportionately represented in the OCA compared to the general population. Liturgical and church traditions, such as forms of singing, liturgics, vestments, iconography, use of Church Slavonic, and architecture broadly reflect those of Russian Orthodoxy.

The OCA states that currently the Russian, Bulgarian, Georgian, Polish, Serbian, and Czech and Slovak churches recognize the autocephaly of the OCA. Among the churches that do not recognize it is the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which argues that the Russian Church did not have the authority to grant autocephaly, partly because the Russian Church at the time was considered to be heavily influenced by the Soviet government. The Ecumenical Patriarch also cites Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon, which asserted the jurisdiction of the bishop of Constantinople in dioceses located &quot;among the barbarians&quot; (i.e. outside the Roman Empire), as the source of the Ecumenical Patriarchate&#x27;s authority in the matter. The remaining churches do not recognize the OCA as autocephalous, although they do recognize the self-governing nature of the church. While the subject of political and ecclesiastical dispute, this controversy does not impair the communion between the OCA and the wider Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Official name==
According to the April 1970 &quot;Tomos of Autocephaly&quot; granted by the Russian Orthodox Church, the official name of the church is &quot;The Autocephalous Orthodox Church in America&quot;. The more comprehensive March 1970 &quot;Agreement of Tomos of Autocephaly&quot;, however, states in Article VIII that the legal name of the church was changed to &quot;Orthodox Church in America&quot; (the Russian language does not use the grammatical articles).

==History==
=== Missionary work ===
The first Eskaleut peoples to become Eastern Orthodox Christians were the Aleuts living in contact with Siberian fur traders in the mid 18th century. They had been baptized mostly by their Eastern Orthodox trading partners or during occasional visits by priests serving aboard exploring vessels of the Russian navy. A Russian colony in Alaska was established in 1784 by merchant Grigory Shelikhov. Shelikhov&#x27;s attempt to colonize Kodiak Island was met with resistance by the native population. He returned to Russia and installed Alexandr Baranov as director of the colony. In order to convince the Russian imperial court of the seriousness of his colonial ambitions, Shelikhov recruited volunteers from the Valaam Monastery, an environment that appears strikingly similar to the Kodiak archipelago&#x27;s landscape, as well as the Konevsky Monastery, to travel to the new colony.

The volunteers, led by Archimandrite Joasaph Bolotov, departed Saint Petersburg on 21 December 1793, and arrived at Kodiak Island on 24 September 1794. When they arrived, they were shocked by the harsh treatment of the Kodiak natives at the hands of the Russian settlers and Baranov. They sent reports to Shelikhov detailing the abuse of the local population, but were ignored. In response, however, the Holy Synod created an auxiliary episcopal see in Alaska in 1796, and elected Fr. Joasaph as bishop. Fr. Joasaph and a small party returned to Russia in 1798 for his consecration and to offer first-hand accounts of what they had seen. During their return voyage to the colony in May 1799, their ship sank and all aboard died. In 1800, Baranov placed the remaining monks under house arrest and forbade them to have any further contact with the local population.

Despite the lack of leadership, the Eastern Orthodox mission in Alaska continued to grow. In 1811, however, the Holy Synod officially closed the episcopal see. It was not until 1823 that the Holy Synod sent instructions for a new priest to travel to Alaska. John Veniaminov of Irkutsk volunteered for the journey, and left Russia in May 1823. He and his family arrived at Unalaska Island on 29 July 1824. In 1840, after the death of his wife, Veniaminov accepted monastic tonsure and, taking the name Innocent, ordination as the Bishop of Kamchatka, the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, making him the first ruling bishop of the Alaskan mission since Bishop Joasaph. Bishop Innocent was elevated to archbishop in 1850. For his missionary and scholarly work that had focused on blending indigenous Alaskan languages and cultures with Orthodox tradition, Innocent became a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church in America in 1977, and is referred to as the Enlightener of the Aleuts and Apostle to the Americas.

===Growth===
In 1868, the first Orthodox church in the contiguous United States was established in San Francisco, California. From the late 19th century until World War I, there was a wave of immigration to the U.S. Within this wave of new people, were immigrants from traditionally Orthodox Christian regions of the world. There were many immigrants from the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires, who formed the backbone of the diocese. Numerous parishes were established across the country throughout the rest of the 19th century. Although these parishes were typically multi-ethnic, most received support from the missionary diocese. In 1872 the diocesan see was relocated from Alaska to the city of San Francisco, California in the United States. The mission itself was instituted as a separate Diocese of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands on June 10, 1870, subsequent to the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. In November 1870, the first Eastern Orthodox church in New York City was consecrated.

Eastern Catholicism was viewed with suspicion by several Latin Church bishops in the United States; some, such as Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, were actually hostile, especially concerning the matter of married clergy. In 1891, Alexis Toth brought a group of 361 Eastern Catholics into Eastern Orthodoxy. From then until his death in 1909, Toth brought approximately 20,000 Eastern Catholics from 65 independent communities to Eastern Orthodoxy. By 1917, 163 Eastern Catholic parishes consisting of more than 100,000 faithful had been converted. For his efforts, Toth was glorified as a saint by the OCA in 1994.
In recognition of the expansion of the church beyond Alaska, Bishop Tikhon (Belavin) petitioned the Holy Synod to change the diocese&#x27;s title to the &quot;Diocese of the Aleutians and North America&quot;. This was approved in February 1900. He consecrated an auxiliary bishop for Alaska in 1903, and in 1904 he consecrated Raphael Hawaweeny to administer to the Arab parishes. In 1905, Bishop Tikhon relocated the diocesan administration from San Francisco to New York City.

In a report to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon proposed dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His plan called for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called for the formation of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues. On 5 March 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon&#x27;s reassignment to Russia that year, however, few of his reforms were implemented.

During this period, education and charity was a focus of the diocese. In 1905, Archbishop Tikhon oversaw the creation of an Eastern Orthodox seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota. St. Platon&#x27;s Seminary moved from Minneapolis to Tenafly, New Jersey, in 1912 and enrolled 78 students from then until 1923. In 1916, an unaccredited Russian women&#x27;s college was established in Brooklyn. An immigrant society and orphanage also were established, as well as the first Orthodox monasteries in the United States (Saint Tikhon&#x27;s Monastery for men in 1905 and Holy Virgin Protection for women in 1915).

By 1917, the American diocese was the largest in the Russian Orthodox Church. It had grown from ten parishes in 1890 to more than 350. Most of the funding for the diocese was provided by Russian Church, via the Imperial Missionary Society. The connections between the American diocese and the Russian Church would be severely compromised by the events of that year.

===Revolution and turmoil===
The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent establishment of the Communist Soviet government ushered in a period of repression for the Russian Orthodox Church. Church property was confiscated and, when Patriarch Tikhon resisted, he was imprisoned from April 1922 until June 1923. On 20 November 1920, Patriarch Tikhon formally authorized Russian Orthodox bishops to set up temporarily independent organizations, until such time as normal communications with and governance from the patriarchate could be restored.

Ethnic groups within the American diocese began to re-align themselves with other national churches. In 1918, a group of Ukrainians in Canada formed the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada, and in 1922, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America was established. In 1926, the Serbs aligned with the Serbian Orthodox Church. As a result of the realignments, Aftimios (Ofiesh) and Platon chartered the American Orthodox Catholic Church in 1927.

In Soviet Russia, a splinter group known as the Living Church gained official state recognition in place of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1922. In the United States, a group of Living Church clergy led by John Kedrovsky attempted to depose ruling American hierarch Bishop Alexander (Nemolovsky). Bishop Alexander, in addition to the political and ethnic struggles of his diocese, had also to deal with mounting Church debt as a result of the loss of funds from the Russian Church. He was forced to mortgage Church property to pay creditors and was replaced, in 1922, by Archbishop Platon (Rozhdestvensky), who had previously served as archbishop of the diocese from 1907 to 1914.

After Archbishop Platon&#x27;s return, he was elected Metropolitan of All America and Canada at the third All-American Sobor in November 1922. Soon after, Communist authorities in Russia (in collaboration with the Living Church) attempted to seize church assets in the United States. In response, the fourth All-American Sobor convened in April 1924. During the Sobor, the historic step of declaring the North American diocese to be temporarily self-governing was taken. This was meant to be necessary only until relations with the Russian Church could be normalized, and the justification for the move was the earlier decree by Patriarch Tikhon. The diocese was officially incorporated as the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church of America.

Despite the conditions set out by Tikhon&#x27;s decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, with which it had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch to submit to the patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire on the part of the Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had allegedly been part.

Despite the declaration of self-governance, Kedrovsky and the Living Church were awarded the church&#x27;s diocesan cathedral in New York City. To prevent further loss of property, the diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties, which made them effectively independent. This, combined with the increasing number of ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other Orthodox jurisdictions (as well as some non-Orthodox), led to a unique situation in Orthodox America whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically. The remainder of the American Church became known informally as the Metropolia (or under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan). Following Patriarch Tikhon&#x27;s death, the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Metropolitan Sergius, began cooperating with the Soviet government. In 1933, the Russian Church declared the Metropolia to be schismatic.

A third Russian church, the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Church Abroad (also known as the Karlovtsy Synod and later, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia or ROCOR), formed in 1921. The synod saw itself as representing all Russian Orthodox abroad, including the Metropolia. The Metropolia cooperated with the synod at first but severed relations with them in 1926, citing the synod&#x27;s increasing claims of authority in America. The synod, for its part, suspended Metropolitan Platon and his clergy. In 1935, an agreement entitled &quot;Temporary Regulations of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad&quot; was signed that normalized relations between the Metropolia and the ROCOR. The 6th All-American Sobor, held in 1937, affirmed that while the Metropolia remained autonomous, it reported to the ROCOR in matters of faith.

The ROCOR, forced to leave Yugoslavia toward the end of World War II, eventually established its base of operations in New York City. In 1946, it was decided at the 7th All-American Sobor that the Metropolia would sever its ties with the ROCOR and attempt to return to the Patriarchate of Moscow. This return was proposed with the stipulation that the Metropolia be allowed to retain its autonomy. When this condition was not met, the Metropolia continued as a self-governing church.

Although there were periodic attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church over the next few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.

===Move toward unity and independence===
Prior to the 13th All-American Sobor in November 1967, a proposal was prepared to change the name of the church from the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church of America to the &quot;Orthodox Church in America&quot;. The Council of Bishops, already aware of the proposal, forbade a vote on the matter. After much debate however, a non-binding straw poll was permitted. The result of the poll was decidedly in favor of the name change. As a result, the decision to deal with the matter at another Sobor (to be held in two years) was made.

In the early 1960s, the Metropolia resumed communication with the Patriarch of Moscow. In 1968, the Metropolia and the Russian Church communicated informally to resolve long-standing differences. Representatives from the Metropolia sought the right of self-governance, as well as the removal of Russian jurisdiction from all matters concerning the American Church. Official negotiations on the matter began in 1969. On 10 April 1970, Patriarch Alexius I and fourteen bishops of the Russian Church&#x27;s Holy Synod signed the official &quot;Tomos of Autocephaly&quot;, which made the newly renamed Orthodox Church in America the fifteenth autocephalous Orthodox Church. The name change, as well as the granting of autocephaly, was officially accepted at the 14th All-American Sobor (also known as the 1st All-American Council in recognition of the Church&#x27;s new-found independence) in October 1970.

The granting of autocephaly by the Moscow Patriarchate was strongly condemned by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople as an act that exceeded the former′s authority and violated the canons. Apologists for the OCA&#x27;s autocephaly claim that the decree did not need the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, as it was an internal matter for the Russian Orthodox Church to decide. Many autocephalous churches, the Russian Church included, were not recognized as such for many years, albeit their autocephaly was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. All canonical Orthodox churches recognize the OCA as canonical and its sacraments as valid, however.

The OCA was a member of the Standing Conference of Orthodox Bishops in America (SCOBA), together with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America (AOCA) and the other member jurisdictions. In 2010, SCOBA was dissolved with the creation of the new Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America, which was mandated by Orthodox patriarchates in 2009 at a meeting in Switzerland. Serious consideration has been given recently to a possible merger between the OCA and the AOCA. Both groups share a significant common history, in that a Syrian priest, Raphael Hawaweeny, was sent by the Moscow Patriarchate in the late 19th century as a missionary to Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians living in North America. Raphael was ordained a bishop in 1904, and his flock eventually became the AOCA. Bishop Raphael was canonized in March 2000 by the OCA as St. Raphael of Brooklyn.

===Financial scandal===

In 2005, former treasurer, Protodeacon Eric Wheeler publicly accused the OCA administration of financial misconduct. Wheeler alleged that millions of dollars in donations to the church were improperly used for personal expenses or to cover shortfalls in church accounts.

A 32-page report was released on 3 September 2008, that addressed the financial scandal and recommended &quot;discipline&quot; for five individuals, including then-primate Metropolitan Herman, his predecessor Metropolitan Theodosius, and two former treasurers as well as a former comptroller. The same report recommended then-primate Metropolitan Herman immediately resign or retire from his post or risk being defrocked.

One day after the report was released, Herman resigned from his position as metropolitan. That November, the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All-American Council. Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop (only 11 days prior) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal. Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous scandal and became a very public metropolitan, seeking to repair damage done by the previous scandal and bring the OCA into the public realm. Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non-Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair the relations between the OCA and traditional Anglican groups. He was invited twice to speak at the conference of the Anglican Church in North America, in 2009 and 2012.

Less than four years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah was asked by the Holy Synod, in a unanimous decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.

On 13 November 2012, an extraordinary All-American Council elected Archbishop Tikhon (Mollard) of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania as the Metropolitan of All-America and Canada. He was installed on 27 January 2013. Metropolitan Tikhon is a convert to the Eastern Orthodox faith and a long-time monk of St. Tikhon&#x27;s Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania.

===Response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine===
On 24 February 2022, in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Metropolitan Tikhon issued a statement saying, in part, &quot;I ask that the hostilities be ceased immediately and that President Putin put an end to the military operations. As Orthodox Christians, we condemn violence and aggression.&quot; On 28 February 2022, he made an urgent appeal for OCA members to contribute to a fund to aid Ukrainian refugees to be administered by the Orthodox Church of Poland. As of 8 March 2022, over had been raised.

On 13 March 2022, Tikhon sent a letter to Patriarch Kirill of Moscow imploring him to use his influence to help put an end to the war.

The OCA continues to recognize the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as the sole canonical Orthodox church in Ukraine and therefore does not accept communion with the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

In June of 2024, Tikhon visited Ukraine and met with Metropolitan Onufriy Berezovsky of the UOC in a show of solidarity for the people of Ukraine. Members of the OCA and UOC held a joint vigil at the Chernivtsi Cathedral during this four day meeting.

==Membership==
The exact number of OCA parishioners is debated. According to the 2006 edition of the &quot;Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches&quot;, the OCA had 1,064,000 members, an increase of 6.4 percent from 2005. This figure places the OCA as the 24th largest Christian church in the United States, and the second largest Eastern Orthodox church in the country, after the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.

In 2000, a study by Alexei D. Krindatch, of the Patriarch Athenagoras Orthodox Institute, presented a substantially lower figure115,100 adherents (baptized Orthodox who attend services on at least an occasional basis and their children) and 39,400 full members (persons older than 18, paying annual Church membership fees). The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, by comparison, was listed as having 440,000 adherents. In response to the study, an OCA representative stated the church had &quot;around 750,000 adults and children.&quot;

In 2004, Jonathan Ivanoff stated in a presentation at the OCA&#x27;s Evangelization Conference that the church&#x27;s census population in 2004 was 27,169, and that membership from 1990 to 2000 declined 13 percent. It further stated that the OCA population in the continental United States declined between six and nine percent per year.

In 2011, &quot;The Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches&quot;, published by Holy Cross Orthodox Press and based on research by Alexei Krindatch, was released. It has extensive data on various Eastern Christian denominations in the United States, including both Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox groups (as well as groups considered uncanonical by those two groups). The publication is endorsed by the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops and is being used by various Assembly committees as part of their research and planning. The Atlas lists the United States membership of the OCA as 84,900, 33,800 of which it says are regular church attendees. It lists the OCA as having 551 parishes and 19 monasteries in the United States. It also indicates the states with the heaviest concentration of OCA parishes are, in order: Alaska (with 86), Pennsylvania (with 83), California (with 43) and New York (with 41).

==Structure==
===Episcopacy===
The supreme canonical authority of the OCA is the Holy Synod of Bishops, composed of all the church&#x27;s diocesan bishops. The &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the Holy Synod is the metropolitan. The Holy Synod meets twice annually; however, special sessions can be called either by the metropolitan or at the request of at least three diocesan bishops.

===Metropolitan===
The primate of the OCA is the metropolitan. He also serves as the bishop of one of the church&#x27;s dioceses. With the other bishops of the church, the metropolitan is considered the first among equals. His official title is &quot;Metropolitan of All-America and Canada&quot;. His role is to manage the welfare of the church, and to act as its representative with other Orthodox Churches, religious organizations, and secular authorities. The metropolitan is elected, when necessary, by the Holy Synod at an All-American Council (a general council of OCA clergy and laity). There are no age or term limits for the metropolitan, and he may retire at any time, but usually does so only for health-related reasons.

===Dioceses===
The diocese is the basic church body that comprises all the parishes of a determined geographical area. It is governed by the Diocesan Bishop, with the assistance of a Diocesan Assembly and a Diocesan Council. The OCA is currently composed of twelve geographic and three ethnic dioceses (Albanian, Bulgarian, and Romanian). The boundaries of the ethnic dioceses overlap those of certain geographic ones. These dioceses are the result of smaller ethnic jurisdictions joining the OCA at some point in its history, usually after having broken from other bodies. Dioceses are established by the Holy Synod whenever needed, and the Synod may also modify the boundaries of an existing diocese.

===All-American Council===
According to the Statute of the Orthodox Church in America, the All-American Council is the &quot;highest legislative and administrative authority within the Church.&quot; The Council is composed roughly of the Metropolitan, all bishops, priests, and selected lay delegates. The purpose of the All-American Council is to discuss and vote on Church matters. When necessary, the Council has also elected new metropolitans.

The period between All-American Councils is set at three years, although this is not always the case. The first thirteen Councils (held from 1907 to 1970) are referred to as All-American Sobors, reflecting the American Church&#x27;s jurisdictional ties to the Russian Orthodox Church. The fourteenth Sobor (held in 1970) is jointly known as the 1st All-American Council, reflecting the autocephalous status of the OCA. The most recent All-American Council (20th) was held in July 2022 in Baltimore, Maryland.

===Metropolitan Council===
The Metropolitan Council is the permanent executive body of the Church&#x27;s administration. It is tasked with implementing the decisions of the All-American Council, as well as handling the Church&#x27;s budgetary concerns. The Council is headed by a chairman (the current Metropolitan), and is composed of the OCA&#x27;s chancellor, secretary, treasurer, and selected clergy and lay delegates. It usually meets twice per year but, in December 2006, a rare joint meeting between the Metropolitan Council and the Holy Synod of Bishops was held.

<text>The Bristol Jupiter is a British nine-cylinder single-row piston radial engine that was built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Originally designed late in World War I and known as the Cosmos Jupiter, a lengthy series of upgrades and developments turned it into one of the finest engines of its era.

The Jupiter was widely used on many aircraft designs during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of Jupiters of all versions were produced, both by Bristol and abroad under licence.

A turbo-supercharged version of the Jupiter known as the Orion suffered development problems and only a small number were produced. The &quot;Orion&quot; name was later re-used by Bristol for an unrelated turboprop engine.

The Bristol Jupiter was licensed by the Soviet Union as the Shvetsov M-22.

==Design and development==
The Jupiter was designed during World War I by Roy Fedden of Brazil Straker and later Cosmos Engineering. The first Jupiter was completed by Brazil Straker in 1918 and featured three carburettors, each one feeding three of the engine&#x27;s nine cylinders via a spiral deflector housed inside the induction chamber. During the rapid downscaling of military spending after the war, Cosmos Engineering became bankrupt in 1920, and was eventually purchased by the Bristol Aeroplane Company on the strengths of the Jupiter design and the encouragement of the Air Ministry. The engine matured into one of the most reliable on the market. It was the first air-cooled engine to pass the Air Ministry full-throttle test, the first to be equipped with automatic boost control, and the first to be fitted to airliners.

The Jupiter was fairly standard in design, but featured four valves per cylinder, which was uncommon at the time. The cylinders were machined from steel forgings, and the cast cylinder heads were later replaced with aluminium alloy following studies by the Royal Aircraft Establishment. In 1927, a change was made to move to a forged head design due to the rejection rate of the castings. The Jupiter VII introduced a mechanically-driven supercharger to the design, and the Jupiter VIII was the first to be fitted with reduction gears.

In 1925, Fedden started designing a replacement for the Jupiter. Using a shorter stroke to increase the revolutions per minute (rpm), and including a supercharger for added power, resulted in the Bristol Mercury of 1927. Applying the same techniques to the original Jupiter-sized engine in 1927 resulted in the Bristol Pegasus. Neither engine would fully replace the Jupiter for a few years.

In 1926 a Jupiter-engined Bristol Bloodhound with the registration G-EBGG completed an endurance flight of , during which the Jupiter ran for a total of 225 hours and 54 minutes without part failure or replacement.

===Licensed production===
The Jupiter saw widespread use in licensed versions, with fourteen countries eventually producing the engine. In France, Gnome-Rhone produced a version known as the Gnome-Rhône 9 Jupiter that was used in several local civilian designs, as well as achieving some export success. Siemens-Halske took out a licence in Germany and produced several versions of increasing power, eventually resulting in the Bramo 323 Fafnir, which saw use in German wartime aircraft.

In Japan, the Jupiter was licence-built from 1924 by Nakajima, forming the basis of its own subsequent radial aero-engine design, the Nakajima Ha-1 Kotobuki. It was produced in Poland as the PZL Bristol Jupiter, in Italy as the Alfa Romeo 126-RC35, and in Czechoslovakia by Walter Engines. The most produced version was in the Soviet Union, where its Shvetsov M-22 version powered the initial Type 4 version of the Polikarpov I-16 (55 units produced). Type 4 Polikarpovs can be identified by their lack of exhaust stubs, rounded NACA cowling and lack of cowling shutters, features which were introduced on the Shvetsov M-25 powered Type 5 and later variants (total production 4,500+ units). Production started in 1918 and ceased in 1930.

==Variants==
The Jupiter was produced in many variants, one of which was the Bristol Orion of 1926. Metallurgy problems with this turbo-supercharged engine caused the project to be abandoned after only nine engines had been built.

==Applications==
The Jupiter is probably best known for powering the Handley Page H.P.42 airliners, which flew the London-Paris route in the 1930s. Other civilian uses included the de Havilland Giant Moth and de Havilland Hercules, the Junkers G 31 and the huge Dornier Do X flying boat, which used no less than twelve engines.

Military uses were less common, but included the parent company&#x27;s Bristol Bulldog, as well as the Gloster Gamecock and Boulton Paul Sidestrand. It was also found in prototypes around the world, from Japan to Sweden.

By 1929 the Bristol Jupiter had flown in 262 different aircraft types,

<doc id="146924" wikidata="Q214098" url="?curid=146924" title="Radial engine">
<text>The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders &quot;radiate&quot; outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel. It resembles a stylized star when viewed from the front, and is called a &quot;star engine&quot; in some other languages.

The radial configuration was commonly used for aircraft engines before gas turbine engines became predominant.

==Engine operation==

Since the axes of the cylinders are coplanar, the connecting rods cannot all be directly attached to the crankshaft unless mechanically complex forked connecting rods are used, none of which have been successful. Instead, the pistons are connected to the crankshaft with a master-and-articulating-rod assembly. One piston, the uppermost one in the animation, has a master rod with a direct attachment to the crankshaft. The remaining pistons pin their connecting rods&#x27; attachments to rings around the edge of the master rod. Extra &quot;rows&quot; of radial cylinders can be added in order to increase the capacity of the engine without adding to its diameter.

Four-stroke radials have an odd number of cylinders per row, so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order can be maintained, providing smooth operation. For example, on a five-cylinder engine the firing order is 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, and back to cylinder 1. Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression. The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform. If an even number of cylinders were used, an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible.

As with most four-strokes, the crankshaft takes two revolutions to complete the four strokes of each piston (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust). The camshaft ring is geared to spin slower and in the opposite direction to the crankshaft. Its cam lobes are placed in two rows; one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust valves. The radial engine normally uses fewer cam lobes than other types. For example, in the engine in the animated illustration, four cam lobes serve all 10 valves across the five cylinders, whereas 10 would be required for a typical inline engine with the same number of cylinders and valves.

Most radial engines use overhead poppet valves driven by pushrods and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, with a few smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances.

==History==
===Aircraft===

C. M. Manly constructed a water-cooled five-cylinder radial engine in 1901, a conversion of one of Stephen Balzer&#x27;s rotary engines, for Langley&#x27;s &quot;Aerodrome&quot; aircraft. Manly&#x27;s engine produced at 950 rpm.

In 1903–1904 Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles to build the world&#x27;s first air-cooled radial engine, a three-cylinder engine which he used as the basis for a more powerful five-cylinder model in 1907. This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free-flight hops.

Another early radial engine was the three-cylinder Anzani, originally built as a W3 &quot;fan&quot; configuration, one of which powered Louis Blériot&#x27;s Blériot XI across the English Channel. Before 1914, Alessandro Anzani had developed radial engines ranging from 3 cylinders (spaced 120° apart) — early enough to have been used on a few French-built examples of the famous Blériot XI from the original Blériot factory — to a massive 20-cylinder engine of , with its cylinders arranged in four rows of five cylinders apiece.

Most radial engines are air-cooled, but one of the most successful of the early radial engines (and the earliest &quot;stationary&quot; design produced for World War I combat aircraft) was the Salmson 9Z series of nine-cylinder water-cooled radial engines that were produced in large numbers. Georges Canton and Pierre Unné patented the original engine design in 1909, offering it to the Salmson company; the engine was often known as the Canton-Unné.

From 1909 to 1919 the radial engine was overshadowed by its close relative, the rotary engine, which differed from the so-called &quot;stationary&quot; radial in that the crankcase and cylinders revolved with the propeller. It was similar in concept to the later radial, the main difference being that the propeller was bolted to the engine, and the crankshaft to the airframe. The problem of the cooling of the cylinders, a major factor with the early &quot;stationary&quot; radials, was alleviated by the engine generating its own cooling airflow.

In World War I many French and other Allied aircraft flew with Gnome, Le Rhône, Clerget, and Bentley rotary engines, the ultimate examples of which reached although none of those over were successful. By 1917 rotary engine development was lagging behind new inline and V-type engines, which by 1918 were producing as much as , and were powering almost all of the new French and British combat aircraft.

Most German aircraft of the time used water-cooled inline 6-cylinder engines. Motorenfabrik Oberursel made licensed copies of the Gnome and Le Rhône rotary powerplants, and Siemens-Halske built their own designs, including the Siemens-Halske Sh.III eleven-cylinder rotary engine, which was unusual for the period in being geared through a bevel geartrain in the rear end of the crankcase &quot;without&quot; the crankshaft being firmly mounted to the aircraft&#x27;s airframe, so that the engine&#x27;s internal working components (fully internal crankshaft &quot;floating&quot; in its crankcase bearings, with its conrods and pistons) were spun in the opposing direction to the crankcase and cylinders, which still rotated as the propeller itself did since it was still firmly fastened to the crankcase&#x27;s frontside, as with regular &quot;umlaufmotor&quot; German rotaries.
By the end of the war the rotary engine had reached the limits of the design, particularly in regard to the amount of fuel and air that could be drawn into the cylinders through the hollow crankshaft, while advances in both metallurgy and cylinder cooling finally allowed stationary radial engines to supersede rotary engines. In the early 1920s Le Rhône converted a number of their rotary engines into stationary radial engines.

By 1918 the potential advantages of air-cooled radials over the water-cooled inline engine and air-cooled rotary engine that had powered World War I aircraft were appreciated but were unrealized. British designers had produced the ABC Dragonfly radial in 1917, but were unable to resolve the cooling problems, and it was not until the 1920s that Bristol and Armstrong Siddeley produced reliable air-cooled radials such as the Bristol Jupiter and the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar.

In the United States the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) noted in 1920 that air-cooled radials could offer an increase in power-to-weight ratio and reliability; by 1921 the U.S. Navy had announced it would only order aircraft fitted with air-cooled radials and other naval air arms followed suit. Charles Lawrance&#x27;s J-1 engine was developed in 1922 with Navy funding, and using aluminum cylinders with steel liners ran for an unprecedented 300 hours, at a time when 50 hours endurance was normal. At the urging of the Army and Navy the Wright Aeronautical Corporation bought Lawrance&#x27;s company, and subsequent engines were built under the Wright name. The radial engines gave confidence to Navy pilots performing long-range overwater flights.

Wright&#x27;s J-5 Whirlwind radial engine of 1925 was widely claimed as &quot;the first truly reliable aircraft engine&quot;. Wright employed Giuseppe Mario Bellanca to design an aircraft to showcase it, and the result was the Wright-Bellanca WB-1, which first flew later that year. The J-5 was used on many advanced aircraft of the day, including Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s Spirit of St. Louis, in which he made the first solo trans-Atlantic flight.

In 1925 the American Pratt &amp; Whitney company was founded, competing with Wright&#x27;s radial engines. Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s initial offering, the R-1340 Wasp, was test run later that year, beginning a line of engines over the next 25 years that included the 14-cylinder, twin-row Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp. More Twin Wasps were produced than any other aviation piston engine in the history of aviation; nearly 175,000 were built.
In the United Kingdom the Bristol Aeroplane Company was concentrating on developing radials such as the Jupiter, Mercury, and sleeve valve Hercules radials. Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union started with building licensed versions of the Armstrong Siddeley, Bristol, Wright, or Pratt &amp; Whitney radials before producing their own improved versions. France continued its development of various rotary engines but also produced engines derived from Bristol designs, especially the Jupiter.

Although other piston configurations and turboprops have taken over in modern propeller-driven aircraft, Rare Bear, which is a Grumman F8F Bearcat equipped with a Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engine, is still the fastest piston-powered aircraft.

125,334 of the American twin-row, 18-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp, with a displacement of 2,800 in3 (46 L) and between 2,000 and 2,400 hp (1,500-1,800 kW), powered the American single-engine Vought F4U Corsair, Grumman F6F Hellcat, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, twin-engine Martin B-26 Marauder, Douglas A-26 Invader, Northrop P-61 Black Widow, etc. The same firm&#x27;s aforementioned smaller-displacement (at 30 litres), &quot;Twin Wasp&quot; 14-cylinder twin-row radial was used as the main engine design for the B-24 Liberator, PBY Catalina, and Douglas C-47, each design being among the production leaders in all-time production numbers for each type of airframe design.

The American Wright Cyclone series twin-row radials powered American warplanes: the nearly-43 litre displacement, 14-cylinder &quot;Twin Cyclone&quot; powered the single-engine Grumman TBF Avenger, twin-engine North American B-25 Mitchell, and some versions of the Douglas A-20 Havoc, with the massive twin-row, nearly 55-litre displacement, 18-cylinder &quot;Duplex-Cyclone&quot; powering the four-engine Boeing B-29 Superfortress and others.

The Soviet Shvetsov &quot;OKB-19&quot; design bureau was the sole source of design for all of the Soviet government factory-produced radial engines used in its World War II aircraft, starting with the Shvetsov M-25 (itself based on the American Wright &quot;Cyclone 9&quot;&#x27;s design) and going on to design the 41-litre displacement Shvetsov ASh-82 fourteen cylinder radial for fighters, and the massive, 58-litre displacement Shvetsov ASh-73 eighteen-cylinder radial in 1946 - the smallest-displacement radial design from the Shvetsov OKB during the war was the indigenously designed, 8.6 litre displacement Shvetsov M-11 five cylinder radial.

Over 28,000 of the German 42-litre displacement, 14-cylinder, two-row BMW 801, with between 1,560 and 2,000 PS (1,540-1,970 hp, or 1,150-1,470 kW), powered the German single-seat, single-engine Focke-Wulf Fw 190 &quot;Würger&quot;, and twin-engine Junkers Ju 88.

In Japan, most airplanes were powered by air-cooled radial engines like the 14-cylinder Mitsubishi Zuisei (11,903 units, e.g. Kawasaki Ki-45), Mitsubishi Kinsei (12,228 units, e.g. Aichi D3A), Mitsubishi Kasei (16,486 units, e.g. Kawanishi H8K), Nakajima Sakae (30,233 units, e.g. Mitsubishi A6M and Nakajima Ki-43), and 18-cylinder Nakajima Homare (9,089 units, e.g. Nakajima Ki-84). The Kawasaki Ki-61 and Yokosuka D4Y were rare examples of Japanese liquid-cooled inline engine aircraft at that time but later, they were also redesigned to fit radial engines as the Kawasaki Ki-100 and Yokosuka D4Y3.

In Britain, Bristol produced both sleeve valved and conventional poppet valved radials: of the sleeve valved designs, more than 57,400 Hercules engines powered the Vickers Wellington, Short Stirling, Handley Page Halifax, and some versions of the Avro Lancaster, over 8,000 of the pioneering sleeve-valved Bristol Perseus were used in various types, and more than 2,500 of the largest-displacement production British radial from the Bristol firm to use sleeve valving, the Bristol Centaurus were used to power the Hawker Tempest II and Sea Fury. The same firm&#x27;s poppet-valved radials included: around 32,000 of Bristol Pegasus used in the Short Sunderland, Handley Page Hampden, and Fairey Swordfish and over 20,000 examples of the firm&#x27;s 1925-origin nine-cylinder Mercury were used to power the Westland Lysander, Bristol Blenheim, and Blackburn Skua.

===Tanks===
In the years leading up to World War II, as the need for armored vehicles was realized, designers were faced with the problem of how to power the vehicles, and turned to using aircraft engines, among them radial types. The radial aircraft engines provided greater power-to-weight ratios and were more reliable than conventional inline vehicle engines available at the time. This reliance had a downside though: if the engines were mounted vertically, as in the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman, their comparatively large diameter gave the tank a higher silhouette than designs using inline engines.

The Continental R-670, a 7-cylinder radial aero engine which first flew in 1931, became a widely used tank powerplant, being installed in the M1 Combat Car, M2 Light Tank, M3 Stuart, M3 Lee, and LVT-2 Water Buffalo.

The Guiberson T-1020, a 9-cylinder radial diesel aero engine, was used in the M1A1E1, while the Continental R975 saw service in the M4 Sherman, M7 Priest, M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, and the M44 self propelled howitzer.

===Modern radials===
A number of companies continue to build radials today. Vedeneyev produces the M-14P radial of as used on Yakovlev and Sukhoi aerobatic aircraft. The M-14P is also used by builders of homebuilt aircraft, such as the Culp Special, and Culp Sopwith Pup, Pitts S12 &quot;Monster&quot; and the Murphy &quot;Moose&quot;.  7-cylinder and  9-cylinder engines are available from Australia&#x27;s Rotec Aerosport. HCI Aviation offers the R180 5-cylinder () and R220 7-cylinder (), available &quot;ready to fly&quot; and as a build-it-yourself kit. Verner Motor of the Czech Republic builds several radial engines ranging in power from . Miniature radial engines for model airplanes are available from O. S. Engines, Saito Seisakusho of Japan, and Shijiazhuang of China, and Evolution (designed by Wolfgang Seidel of Germany, and made in India) and Technopower in the US.

==Comparison with inline engines==
Liquid cooling systems are generally more vulnerable to battle damage. Even minor shrapnel damage can easily result in a loss of coolant and consequent engine overheating, while an air-cooled radial engine may be largely unaffected by minor damage. Radials have shorter and stiffer crankshafts, a single-bank radial engine needing only two crankshaft bearings as opposed to the seven required for a liquid-cooled, six-cylinder, inline engine of similar stiffness.

While a single-bank radial permits all cylinders to be cooled equally, the same is not true for multi-row engines where the rear cylinders can be affected by the heat coming off the front row, and air flow being masked.

A potential disadvantage of radial engines is that having the cylinders exposed to the airflow increases drag considerably. The answer was the addition of specially designed cowlings with baffles to force the air between the cylinders. The first effective drag-reducing cowling that didn&#x27;t impair engine cooling was the British Townend ring or &quot;drag ring&quot; which formed a narrow band around the engine covering the cylinder heads, reducing drag. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics studied the problem, developing the NACA cowling which further reduced drag and improved cooling. Nearly all aircraft radial engines since have used NACA-type cowlings.

While inline liquid-cooled engines continued to be common in new designs until late in World War II, radial engines dominated afterwards until overtaken by jet engines, with the late-war Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat, two of the fastest production piston-engined aircraft ever built, using radial engines.

==Hydrolock==
Whenever a radial engine remains shut down for more than a few minutes, oil or fuel may drain into the combustion chambers of the lower cylinders or accumulate in the lower intake pipes, ready to be drawn into the cylinders when the engine starts. As the piston approaches top dead center (TDC) of the compression stroke, this liquid, being incompressible, stops piston movement. Starting or attempting to start the engine in such condition may result in a bent or broken connecting rod.

==Other types of radial engine==

===Multi-row radials===

Originally radial engines had one row of cylinders, but as engine sizes increased it became necessary to add extra rows. The first radial-configuration engine known to use a twin-row design was the 160 hp Gnôme &quot;Double Lambda&quot; rotary engine of 1912, designed as a 14-cylinder twin-row version of the firm&#x27;s 80 hp Lambda single-row seven-cylinder rotary, however reliability and cooling problems limited its success.

Two-row designs began to appear in large numbers during the 1930s, when aircraft size and weight grew to the point where single-row engines of the required power were simply too large to be practical. Two-row designs often had cooling problems with the rear bank of cylinders, but a variety of baffles and fins were introduced that largely eliminated these problems. The downside was a relatively large frontal area that had to be left open to provide enough airflow, which increased drag. This led to significant arguments in the industry in the late 1930s about the possibility of using radials for high-speed aircraft like modern fighters.

The solution was introduced with the BMW 801 14-cylinder twin-row radial. Kurt Tank designed a new cooling system for this engine that used a high-speed fan to blow compressed air into channels that carry air to the middle of the banks, where a series of baffles directed the air over all of the cylinders. This allowed the cowling to be tightly fitted around the engine, reducing drag, while still providing (after a number of experiments and modifications) enough cooling air to the rear. This basic concept was soon copied by many other manufacturers, and many late-WWII aircraft returned to the radial design as newer and much larger designs began to be introduced. Examples include the Bristol Centaurus in the Hawker Sea Fury, and the Shvetsov ASh-82 in the Lavochkin La-7.

For even greater power, adding further rows was not considered viable due to the difficulty of providing the required airflow to the rear banks. Larger engines were designed, mostly using water cooling although this greatly increased complexity and eliminated some of the advantages of the radial air-cooled design. One example of this concept is the BMW 803, which never entered service.

A major study into the airflow around radials using wind tunnels and other systems was carried out in the US, and demonstrated that ample airflow was available with careful design. This led to the R-4360, which has 28 cylinders arranged in a 4 row &quot;corncob&quot; configuration. The R-4360 saw service on large American aircraft in the post-World War II period. The US and Soviet Union continued experiments with larger radials, but the UK abandoned such designs in favour of newer versions of the Centaurus and rapid movement to the use of turboprops such as the Armstrong Siddeley Python and Bristol Proteus, which easily produced more power than radials without the weight or complexity.

Large radials continued to be built for other uses, although they are no longer common. An example is the 5-ton Zvezda M503 diesel engine with 42 cylinders in 6 rows of 7, displacing and producing . Three of these were used on the fast Osa class missile boats. Another one was the Lycoming XR-7755 which was the largest piston aircraft engine ever built in the United States with 36 cylinders totaling about 7,750 in3 (127 L) of displacement and a power output of 5,000 horsepower (3,700 kilowatts).

===Diesel radials===

While most radial engines have been produced for gasoline, there have been diesel radial engines. Two major advantages favour diesel engines — lower fuel consumption and reduced fire risk.

;Packard
Packard designed and built a 9-cylinder 980 cubic inch (16.06 litre) displacement diesel radial aircraft engine, the DR-980, in 1928. On 28 May 1931, a DR-980 powered Bellanca CH-300, with 481 gallons of fuel, piloted by Walter Edwin Lees and Frederick Brossy set a record for staying aloft for 84 hours and 32 minutes without being refueled. This record stood for 55 years until broken by the Rutan Voyager.

;Bristol
The experimental Bristol Phoenix of 1928–1932 was successfully flight tested in a Westland Wapiti and set altitude records in 1934 that lasted until World War II.

;Clerget
In 1932 the French company Clerget developed the 14D, a 14-cylinder two-stroke diesel radial engine. After a series of improvements, in 1938 the 14F2 model produced at 1910 rpm cruise power, with a power-to-weight ratio near that of contemporary gasoline engines and a specific fuel consumption of roughly 80% that for an equivalent gasoline engine. During WWII the research continued, but no mass-production occurred because of the Nazi occupation. By 1943 the engine had grown to produce over with a turbocharger. After the war, the Clerget company was integrated in the SNECMA company and had plans for a 32-cylinder diesel engine of , but in 1947 the company abandoned piston engine development in favour of the emerging turbine engines.

;Nordberg
The Nordberg Manufacturing Company of the United States developed and produced a series of large two-stroke radial diesel engines from the late 1940s for electrical production, primarily at aluminum smelters and for pumping water. They differed from most radials in that they had an even number of cylinders in a single bank (or row) and an unusual double master connecting rod. Variants were built that could be run on either diesel oil or gasoline or mixtures of both. A number of powerhouse installations utilising large numbers of these engines were made in the U.S.

;EMD
Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built the &quot;pancake&quot; engines 16-184 and 16-338 for marine use.

;Zoche
Zoche aero-diesels are a prototype radial design that have an even number of cylinders, either four or eight; but this is not problematic, because they are two-stroke engines, with twice the number of power strokes as a four-stroke engine per crankshaft rotation.

===Compressed air radial engines===
A number of radial motors operating on compressed air have been designed, mostly for use in model airplanes and in gas compressors.

===Model radial engines===
A number of multi-cylinder 4-stroke model engines have been commercially available in a radial configuration, beginning with the Japanese O.S. Max firm&#x27;s FR5-300 five-cylinder, 3.0 cu.in. (50 cm3) displacement &quot;Sirius&quot; radial in 1986. The American &quot;Technopower&quot; firm had made smaller-displacement five- and seven-cylinder model radial engines as early as 1976, but the OS firm&#x27;s engine was the first mass-produced radial engine design in aeromodelling history. The rival Saito Seisakusho firm in Japan has since produced a similarly sized five-cylinder radial four-stroke model engine of their own as a direct rival to the OS design, with Saito also creating a series of three-cylinder methanol and gasoline-fueled model radial engines ranging from 0.90 cu.in. (15 cm3) to 4.50 cu.in. (75 cm3) in displacement, also all now available in spark-ignition format up to 84 cm3 displacement for use with gasoline. The German Seidel firm formerly made both seven- and nine-cylinder &quot;large&quot; (starting at 35 cm3 displacement) radio control model radial engines, mostly for glow plug ignition, with an experimental fourteen-cylinder twin-row radial being tried out - the American Evolution firm now sells the Seidel-designed radials, with their manufacturing being done in India.

<doc id="146925" wikidata="Q428972" url="?curid=146925" title="Battle of Wittstock">
<text>The Battle of Wittstock took place during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). It was fought on 24 September (Julian calendar) or 4 October (Gregorian calendar) 1636. A Swedish-allied army commanded jointly by Johan Banér and Alexander Leslie decisively defeated a combined Imperial-Saxon army, led by Count Melchior von Hatzfeld and the Saxon Elector John George I.

Leslie and Banér commanded two distinct armies: Banér commanded the Swedish main army (huvudarmén), and Leslie commanded the Army of the Weser. Their subordinate officers included the Swedish Count and Major General Lennart Torstenson, Lieutenant General James King (later first Lord Eythin), and Major General John Ruthven. The latter is sometimes erroneously conflated with his uncle Patrick Ruthven who was also a Lieutenant General in the Swedish army, but not present at Wittstock.

==Context==
The Holy Roman Emperor, with his Saxon and Roman Catholic allies, was fighting for the control of northern Germany against the Swedes and an alliance of Protestant princes opposed to Habsburg hegemony. The Swedes were also allied to the French, but the latter played no part in the battle. The Imperial main army was screening the Swedish army behind the Elbe while a smaller army under General Klitzing was overrunning Brandenburg. Field Marshal Johan Banér commanding the main Swedish army was joined by Field Marshal Alexander Leslie commanding the Army of the Weser which comprised German, Scottish and (at least one) English regiments. Together they crossed the Elbe with a surprise march and met their opponents in the forested hilly landscape slightly south of Wittstock.

The Imperial army was larger in strength than the Swedish army, but at least one-third of it was composed of Saxon units of questionable quality. The Swedish artillery was considerably stronger, leading the Imperial commanders to maintain a largely defensive position on the hill tops.

==The battle==
The Imperial forces decided to wait for the Swedes on a range of sandy hills, the Scharfenberg. A part of the Imperial front was further defended with six ditches and a wall of linked wagons. Their commanders waited for some time for the Swedish troops to appear on the open fields to their front. Instead, the Swedish army was turning the Imperial left flank, moving behind the cover of a series of linked hills. The Imperial troops were forced to redeploy their lines to set up a new front.

The battle was begun by small forces detached in detail to secure the hills. The Swedes, under Banér had problems moving up reinforcements through marshy ground, but battle was eventually joined along a wide front.

Banér and Leslie had detached one-fourth of the army under Lieutenant-General James King and Major-General Torsten Stålhandske to take a long detour around the Imperial right flank. They found the traverse difficult and slow, leading Banér&#x27;s troops to take heavy casualties and begin to retreat. Alexander Leslie moved five of his regiments to his relief taking heavy casualties in the process with the Scottish and English regiments being particularly badly mauled. Nonetheless they were able to relieve Banér in time for King&#x27;s cavalry to finally outflank the Imperial troops causing a rout. With Major General Vitzthum in the reserve refusing to engage the Imperials, his role was taken by Major-General John Ruthven (Leslie&#x27;s son-in-law) who had been so deployed for just such an emergency. Now attacked on two fronts and with the reserve brigades engaged, the Imperial forces, having lost all their artillery, retreated under the cover of dusk in full rout.

==Conclusion==
In the accounts of the battle preserved in National Archives of Sweden, Johan Banér accredits the victory to Field Marshal Leslie. Leslie, in his personal correspondence to the Swedish Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, was clearly horrified at the losses sustained by his army and implies that there had been disagreement about the wisdom of Banér&#x27;s tactics before the battle. A third report, by James King conforms with Leslie&#x27;s, but also contains additional information. All three have been transcribed, translated and published in English. Nevertheless, Wittstock was a resounding victory for the Swedish forces and corrected any delusions harboured by the Imperials that they were a spent force after the earlier battle of Nördlingen.

<doc id="146927" wikidata="Q670180" url="?curid=146927" title="Unlambda">
<text>Unlambda is a minimal, &quot;nearly pure&quot; functional programming language invented by David Madore. It is based on combinatory logic, an expression system without the lambda operator or free variables. It relies mainly on two built-in functions (codice_1 and codice_2) and an apply operator (written codice_3, the backquote character). These alone make it Turing-complete, but there are also some input/output (I/O) functions to enable interacting with the user, some shortcut functions, and a lazy evaluation function. Variables are unsupported.

Unlambda is free and open-source software distributed under a GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0 or later.

==Basic principles==
As an esoteric programming language, Unlambda is meant as a demonstration of very pure functional programming rather than for practical use. Its main feature is the lack of conventional operators and data types—the only kind of data in the program are one-parameter functions. Data can nevertheless be simulated with appropriate functions as in the lambda calculus. Multi-parameter functions can be represented via the method of currying.

Unlambda is based on the principle of abstraction elimination, or the elimination of all saved variables, including functions. As a purely functional language, Unlambda&#x27;s functions are first-class objects, and are the &quot;only&quot; such objects.

Here is an implementation of a hello world program in Unlambda:

 `r```````````.H.e.l.l.o. .w.o.r.l.di

==Original built-in functions==
The notation codice_4 denotes a function which takes one argument and returns it unchanged, printing the single character &quot;x&quot; as a side effect when it is invoked. codice_5 represents the version of the identity function that has no such side effect; it is used here as a dummy argument. The program codice_6 applies the codice_7-printing function to a dummy argument of codice_5, returning codice_5 and printing the letter codice_7 as a side effect. Similarly, codice_11 first applies codice_12 to codice_13, printing the letter codice_14 and returning codice_13; this result of codice_13 is then applied to codice_5 as in the previous example. The function codice_18 is syntactic sugar for the function that prints a newline character.

Other important features provided by Unlambda include the codice_2 and codice_1 functions. codice_2 manufactures constant functions: the result of codice_22 is a function which, when invoked, returns &quot;x&quot;. Thus the value of codice_23 is &quot;x&quot; for any &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

codice_1 is a generalized evaluation operator. codice_25 evaluates to codice_26 for any &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;. It is a remarkable fact that codice_1 and codice_2 are sufficient to perform any calculation, as described in SKI combinator calculus. As a brief example, the identity function codice_5 can be implemented as codice_30, since codice_31 yields &quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot;.

Unlambda&#x27;s one flow control construct is call with current continuation, denoted codice_32. When an expression of the form codice_33 is evaluated, a special &quot;continuation&quot; object is constructed, representing the state of the interpreter at that moment. Then &quot;x&quot; is evaluated, and then the result is given the continuation object as an argument. If the continuation is never applied to an argument, the value of the codice_33 expression is the same as the value of &quot;x&quot;. But if the continuation object is applied to a value &quot;y&quot;, execution of &quot;x&quot; is immediately aborted, and the value of the entire codice_33 expression is &quot;y&quot;.

Unlambda&#x27;s execution semantics are normally eager evaluation, but a lazy evaluation option exists, indicated by the use of the codice_7 operator. Usually, to evaluate an expression of the form codice_37, unlambda first evaluates &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;y&quot;, and then applies &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. However, if &quot;x&quot; evaluates to the special value codice_7, then &quot;y&quot; is &quot;not&quot; evaluated; instead, the value of the expression codice_39 is a special &quot;delayed computation&quot; object, which, when applied to an argument &quot;z&quot;, evaluates &quot;y&quot;, and then applies its value to &quot;z&quot;. In the absence of side effects, this is exactly the same as codice_40. The difference is that codice_40 executes any side effects in &quot;y&quot; immediately, whereas codice_39 defers the side effects until the result is applied to another argument.

Unlambda&#x27;s next built-in operator is codice_43, which ignores its argument and returns codice_43. This feature is not strictly necessary, since codice_43 could be implemented as codice_46, but it is supplied as a convenience. (This expression above is simply codice_47, where codice_48 denotes a fixed point combinator.)

==Version 2 built-in functions==
More built-ins were introduced in Unlambda version 2. Input is facilitated by operators codice_49 and codice_50. When codice_49 is applied to a function &quot;x&quot;, a character is read from input, and stored as the &quot;current character&quot;; then &quot;x&quot; is applied to codice_5. However, if no more characters were available on input, the &quot;current character&quot; is left undefined, and &quot;x&quot; is applied to codice_43 instead. When a function codice_50 is applied to a function &quot;x&quot;, the result is the evaluation of codice_55 if the current character is &quot;u&quot;, otherwise codice_56 is evaluated.

There is also a &quot;reprint&quot; operator codice_57. When codice_58 is evaluated, the function &quot;x&quot; is applied to codice_59 if &quot;u&quot; is the current character, or to codice_43 if there is no current character.

Finally, there is an exit operator codice_61. When codice_61 is applied to &quot;x&quot;, the execution of the program is terminated, and &quot;x&quot; is taken as the result of the program (most of the currently existing interpreters ignore the result anyway).

<text>The Bristol Pegasus is a British nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial aero engine. Designed by Roy Fedden of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, it was used to power both civil and military aircraft of the 1930s and 1940s. Developed from the earlier Mercury and Jupiter engines, later variants could produce from its capacity of 1,750 cubic inches (28 L) by use of a geared supercharger.

Further developments of the Pegasus created the fuel-injected Bristol Draco and the diesel Bristol Phoenix, both types being produced in limited numbers. In contrast, by the end of production over 30,000 Pegasus engines had been built. Aircraft applications ranged from single-engine biplanes to the four-engined Short Sandringham and Sunderland flying boats. Several altitude and distance records were set by aircraft using the Pegasus.

The Bristol Siddeley company reused the name many years later for the turbofan engine used in the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and which became known as the Rolls-Royce Pegasus when Rolls-Royce took over that company. Two Bristol Pegasus engines remain airworthy in 2010, powering Fairey Swordfish aircraft operated by the Royal Navy Historic Flight (became Navy Wings in March 2019); other examples are preserved and on public display in aviation museums.

==Design and development==

The Pegasus was designed by Sir Roy Fedden as the follow-on to the Bristol Aeroplane Company&#x27;s very successful Bristol Jupiter, using lessons learned in development of the Mercury. Although having a capacity (25 L) almost 15% smaller, the Mercury produced about as much power as the Jupiter, through a combination of supercharging to improve the &quot;charge&quot;, and various changes to increase the operating RPM. The power of a piston engine can be calculated by multiplying the charge per cylinder by the number of cycles per second; the Mercury improved both and thereby produced more power for a given size. The primary advantage was a much improved power-to-weight ratio due to better volumetric efficiency.
The Pegasus was the same size, displacement and general steel/aluminium construction as the Jupiter, but various improvements allowed the maximum engine speed to be increased from 1,950 to 2,600 rpm for take-off power. This improved performance considerably from the Jupiter&#x27;s , to the first Pegasus II with , to in the first production model Pegasus III, and eventually to the late-model Pegasus XXII with thanks to the two-speed supercharger (introduced on the Pegasus XVIII) and 100-octane fuel. This gave rise to the claim &quot;one pound per horsepower&quot; reflecting the excellent power-to-weight ratio.

Some notable users of the Pegasus were the Fairey Swordfish, Vickers Wellington, and Short Sunderland. It was also used on the Anbo 41, Bristol Bombay, Saro London, Short Empire, Vickers Wellesley and the Westland Wallace. Like the Jupiter before it, the Pegasus was also licensed by the PZL company in Poland. It was used on the PZL.23 Karaś and PZL.37 Łoś bombers.

In Italy Alfa Romeo Avio built both the Jupiter (126-RC35) and the Pegasus under licence, with the engine based on the Pegasus designated as the Alfa Romeo 126-RC34 with the civil version as the 126-RC10. In Czechoslovakia it was built by Walter Engines and was known as the Pegas.

Approximately 32,000 Pegasus engines were built. The Pegasus set three height records in the Bristol Type 138: in 1932, 1936 and 1937. It was used for the first flight over Mount Everest in the Westland Wallace, and in 1938 set the world&#x27;s long-distance record in Vickers Wellesleys.

In service the Pegasus was generally reliable with the exception that the valves were prone to failure. The valves were operated by rocker-boxes, which were lubricated by oil pads on the top of the cylinder heads. In hot climates the lubrication deteriorated which could lead to seizing of the valves. Also if a problem developed with the engine and the pilot shut it down it was not possible to &quot;feather&quot; the propeller and so it would continue to rotate creating drag and continue to turn the engine which had no lubrication being forced through it by the oil pump.

==Variants==
The Pegasus was produced in many variants, early prototype engines were unsupercharged but the majority used a geared supercharger, either single-speed or two-speed. Variant differences included compression ratios, propeller reduction gear ratios and accessories.

==Applications==

&quot;Note:&quot;
==Engines on display==
Bristol Pegasus engines can be viewed installed in aircraft at the Royal Air Force Museum London and the Imperial War Museum Duxford. An unrestored Pegasus recovered from the sea bed is in the care of the Bristol Aero Collection, which is closed while moving from Kemble Airport to Filton.

There is also an engine on display at the Brooklands Museum at Weybridge.

==Survivors==
As of October 2010 two Bristol Pegasus engines remain airworthy in England. They power the two Fairey Swordfish aircraft operated by the Royal Navy Historic Flight.

<doc id="146929" wikidata="Q454069" url="?curid=146929" title="George Pickett">
<text>George Edward Pickett (January 16, 1825 – July 30, 1875) was a career United States Army officer who became a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He is best remembered for being one of the commanders at Pickett&#x27;s Charge, the futile and bloody Confederate offensive on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg that bears his name.

Pickett graduated last out of 59 cadets in the United States Military Academy class of 1846. He served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War and is noted for his service in the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847. After this, he served in the Washington Territory and eventually reached the rank of captain. Pickett participated in the Pig War of 1859. Near the beginning of the American Civil War, he was commissioned in the Confederate States Army, and attained the rank of brigadier general in January 1862. He commanded a brigade that saw heavy action during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. Pickett was wounded at the Battle of Gaines&#x27;s Mill on June 27.

He returned to command in September, following the Battle of Antietam, when he was given command of a division in the Right Wing of the Army of Northern Virginia, in the command of Major General James Longstreet, which became the I Corps that December. His division was lightly engaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg and, along with most of Longstreet&#x27;s Corps, missed the Battle of Chancellorsville while participating in the Suffolk Campaign in 1863. During the Gettysburg Campaign, his division was, much to Pickett&#x27;s frustration, the last to arrive on the field. However, it was one of three divisions under the command of General Longstreet to participate in a disastrous assault on Union positions on July 3, the final day of the battle. The attack has been given the name &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Charge.&quot; In February 1864, Pickett ordered 22 North Carolinians in Union uniform hanged as deserters after a failed assault on New Bern. His military career came to an inglorious end when his division was overwhelmed and defeated at the Battle of Five Forks.

Following the war, Pickett feared prosecution for his execution of deserters and temporarily fled to Canada. An old Army friend, Ulysses S. Grant, interceded on his behalf, and he returned to Virginia in 1866. He could not rejoin the Army, so he tried his hand at farming, then selling insurance. He died at age 50 in July 1875 from an &quot;abscess of the liver.&quot;

==Early life==
George Edward Pickett was born in his grandfather&#x27;s shop in Richmond, Virginia, on January 16, 1825, and raised on his family&#x27;s plantation at Turkey Island. He was the first of the eight children of Robert and Mary Pickett, a prominent old Virginia family of English and French Huguenot origins. He was a cousin of future Confederate general Henry Heth.

For a time in the 1840s, Pickett lived and served as a law clerk for his uncle Andrew Johnston in Quincy, Illinois. He went to Springfield, Illinois, to study law, but at the age of 17 he was appointed to the United States Military Academy. Legend has it that Pickett&#x27;s appointment was secured for him by Abraham Lincoln, but this is largely believed to be a story circulated by his widow following his death. Lincoln, as an Illinois state legislator, could not nominate candidates, although he did give the young man advice after he was accepted. In fact, Pickett was appointed by Illinois Congressman John T. Stuart, a friend of Pickett&#x27;s uncle and a law partner of Lincoln.

Pickett was popular as a cadet at West Point. He was mischievous and a player of pranks, &quot;a man of ability, but belonging to a cadet set that appeared to have no ambition for class standing and wanted to do only enough study to secure their graduation.&quot; At a time when often a third of the class left before graduation, Pickett persisted, working off his demerits and doing enough in his studies to graduate, ranking last of the 59 surviving students in the Class of 1846. It is a position held with some backhanded distinction, referred to today as the &quot;goat,&quot; for both its stubbornness and tenacity. Ordinarily, such a showing would be a ticket to an obscure posting and a dead-end career, but Pickett, like George Armstrong Custer a generation later, had the fortune to graduate just as a war broke out, resulting in a sudden need for many junior army officers. Pickett&#x27;s cousin Henry Heth graduated last in the Class of 1847.

==United States Army career==
July 1, 1846, Pickett was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Regiment. He soon gained national recognition in the Mexican–American War when he carried the American colors over the parapet during the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847. Wounded at the base of the wall, Pickett&#x27;s friend and colleague Lieutenant James Longstreet handed him the colors. Pickett carried the flag over the wall and fought his way to the roof of the palace, unfurling it over the fortress and announcing its surrender. He received a second brevet promotion, to captain, following this action. His record of service, compiled by the Adjutant-General&#x27;s Office in March 1887 at the request of his widow, states: Brevetted first lieutenant August 20, 1847, &quot;for gallant and meritorious conduct in the battles of Contreras, and Churubusco, Mexico&quot;; and captain September 13, 1847, &quot;for gallant and meritorious conduct at Chapultepec, Mexico.&quot;

June 28, 1849, while serving on the Texas frontier after the war, he was promoted to first lieutenant and then to captain in the 9th Infantry Regiment March 3, 1855. In 1853, Pickett challenged a fellow junior officer, future Union general Winfield Scott Hancock, to a duel; (they had met only briefly when Hancock was passing through Texas). Hancock declined the duel, a response not unlikely as dueling had fallen out of favor at the time.

In January 1851, Pickett married Sally Harrison Minge, the daughter of Dr. John Minge of Virginia, the great-great-grandniece of President William Henry Harrison, and the great-great-granddaughter of Benjamin Harrison V, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Sally died during childbirth that November, at Fort Gates, Texas.

Pickett next served in the Washington Territory. In 1856 he commanded the construction of Fort Bellingham on Bellingham Bay, in what is today the city of Bellingham, Washington. He also built a frame home that year which still stands; Pickett House is the oldest house in Bellingham and the oldest house on its original foundation in the Pacific Northwest. While posted to Fort Bellingham, Pickett married a Native American woman of the Haida tribe, Morning Mist, who gave birth to a son, James Tilton Pickett (1857–1889); Morning Mist died a few months later. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Pickett made a name for himself as a newspaper artist, before dying of tuberculosis at the age of 32 near Portland, Oregon.

In 1859 Pickett was dispatched in command of Company D, 9th US Infantry, to garrison San Juan Island in response to discord that had arisen there between American farmers and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The confrontation, known as the Pig War, was instigated when American farmer Lyman Cutler shot and killed a pig that had repeatedly broken into his garden. The pig belonged to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and though Cutler was prepared to pay a fair price for the pig, the Company was not satisfied, insisting he be brought before the British magistrate, thus initiating the territorial dispute. In response to the U.S. forces, the British sent a force of three warships and 1000 men. The British commander, Captain Geoffrey Phipps Hornby (H.M.S. &#x27;Tribune&#x27;, 30 guns), demanded that Pickett and his men leave. Pickett declined, and the British officer returned to his frigate, threatening to land his own men. Pickett with his 68 men appeared to be fully prepared to oppose a British landing, ordering them into a line of battle near the beach. &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid of their big guns,&quot; he told his men, &quot;We&#x27;ll make a Bunker Hill of it.&quot; Pickett&#x27;s presence and determination prevented the landing, the British being under orders to avoid armed conflict with United States forces, if possible. Pickett had set up camp and his battery of cannon near the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Belle Vue Sheep Farm, and directly under the cannons of the British warship. Having this error pointed out to him, he moved the camp and battery a few miles north to high ground, to a spot overlooking Griffin Bay and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. After initial tensions passed the crisis was averted, both sides being unwilling to go to war over a pig. President James Buchanan dispatched Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott to negotiate a settlement between the parties.

There is also some controversy that Pickett and General William S. Harney, per General Granville O. Haller, maneuvered behind the scenes to provoke a war between the United States and Britain, to distract the North, allowing the South to seek independence or, as General George B. McClellan said, to unite the North and South.

==Civil War==
===Early assignments===
On April 19, after the firing on Battle of Fort Sumter and in response to President Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion, Virginia joined three more Southern states in seceding from the Union. Native son Pickett sailed from San Juan Island to Bellingham, Washington, to resign his commission and was told by his commander that he had to resign it in Washington, D.C. To accomplish this he sailed to Fort Steilacoom, south of Tacoma, Washington, and caught transport aboard a mail steamer to the Isthmus of Panama, trekked 40 miles overland to Colon, caught another ship to Richmond, Virginia, to obtain a commission in the Army of Northern Virginia, and continued to Washington, D.C., to turn in his resignation. Arriving after the First Battle of Bull Run, he resigned his commission in the U.S. Army on June 25, 1861; he had been holding a commission as a major in the Confederate States Army Artillery since March 16. Within a month he was appointed colonel in command of the Rappahannock Line of the Department of Fredericksburg, Virginia, under the command of Major General Theophilus H. Holmes. Holmes&#x27;s influence obtained a commission for Pickett as a brigadier general, dated January 14, 1862.
Pickett made a colorful general. He rode a sleek black charger named &quot;Old Black,&quot; and wore a small blue kepi-style cap, with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat, and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots. He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond the corners of his mouth and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was the talk of the Army: &quot;long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby.&quot;

Pickett&#x27;s first combat command was during the Peninsula Campaign, leading a brigade that was nicknamed the Gamecocks (the brigade would eventually be led by Richard B. Garnett in Pickett&#x27;s Charge). Pickett led his brigade ably in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines, earning commendations from his superiors. At Gaines&#x27;s Mill on June 27 he was shot off his horse while leading his brigade in its first assault. Pickett continued to move forward with his men for a while, leading his horse on foot. A second assault by Pickett&#x27;s brigade, led by Colonel Eppa Hunton, along with the brigade led by Cadmus M. Wilcox, broke the Union line. Pickett feared that he had taken a mortal blow to his shoulder, but the wound was initially assessed by others as minor. The shoulder wound turned out to be severe enough that, though it was not fatal, Pickett was out of action for the next three months, and his arm would remain stiff for at least a year.

When Pickett returned to the Army in September 1862, following the Battle of Antietam, he was given command of a two-brigade division in the corps commanded by his old colleague from Mexico, Major General Longstreet. Pickett was promoted to major general on October 10. Shortly afterwards his division was upgraded to five brigades, commanded by Generals Garnett, James L. Kemper, Lewis Armistead, Montgomery Dent Corse and Micah Jenkins. The division was only lightly engaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December.

===Suffolk and courtship===
Longstreet and two of his divisions—those commanded by Pickett and John Bell Hood—were detached from Lee&#x27;s main army in April while participating in the Suffolk Campaign. They thus missed the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Suffolk Campaign was minor and inconclusive, while the Battle of Chancellorsville was an enormous Confederate victory.

Before the Gettysburg Campaign, Pickett fell in love with a Virginia teenager, LaSalle &quot;Sallie&quot; Corbell (1843–1931), commuting back and forth from his duties in Suffolk to be with her. Although Sallie would later insist that she met him in 1852 (at age 9), she did not marry the 38-year-old widower until November 13, 1863. The couple had two children, George Edward Pickett, Jr. (born July 17, 1864) and David Corbell Pickett (born 1865 or 1866). David died in late 1873 or January 1874 of measles.

At Suffolk, Longstreet grew impatient with Pickett&#x27;s frequent trips away from his division to see Sallie at her home in nearby Chuckatuck. Pickett then decided to ask for permission for the visits from Longstreet&#x27;s chief of staff, Moxley Sorrel, who referred him to Longstreet. Instead of asking Longstreet, Pickett went without permission. After the war, Sorrel commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t think his division benefitted by such carpet-knight doings in the field.&quot;

===Gettysburg and Pickett&#x27;s Charge===

Pickett&#x27;s division arrived at the Battle of Gettysburg on the evening of the second day, July 2, 1863. It was reduced to three brigades present, Corse&#x27;s still being detached in Virginia and Jenkins&#x27; transferred. It had been delayed by the assignment of guarding the Confederate lines of communication through Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. After two days of heavy fighting, General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia, which had initially driven the Union Army of the Potomac to the high ground south of Gettysburg, had been unable to dislodge the Union soldiers from their position. Lee&#x27;s plan for July 3 called for a massive assault on the center of the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge, based on the assumption that Meade had concentrated his forces to protect his flanks while leaving his center weak. Lee directed General Longstreet to assemble a force of three divisions for the attack—two divisions from the corps of Lieutenant General A. P. Hill, under the temporary command of J. Johnston Pettigrew and Major General Isaac R. Trimble, which had both seen action on July 1, and Pickett&#x27;s fresh division from Longstreet&#x27;s own corps. The center was occupied by the Union II Corps, commanded by Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Longstreet was technically in command, not Pickett. Nevertheless, the attack became known as &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Charge&quot;. In addition, much of the mythology of the Charge arose from newspaper reports. As Pickett was the only major general from Virginia to participate in the charge, the Virginia newspapers both played up their native son&#x27;s role and made the assault a more &quot;glamorous&quot; event.

Following a two-hour artillery barrage meant to soften up the Union defenses, the three divisions stepped off across open fields almost a mile from Cemetery Ridge. Pickett inspired his men by shouting, &quot;Up, men, and to your posts! Let no man forget today that you are from Old Virginia.&quot; Pickett&#x27;s division, with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Armistead, Garnett, and Kemper, was on the right flank of the assault. It received punishing artillery fire, and then volleys of massed musket fire as it approached its objective. Armistead&#x27;s brigade made the farthest progress through the Union lines. Armistead was mortally wounded, falling near &quot;The Angle&quot;, at what is now termed the &quot;high-water mark of the Confederacy&quot;. Neither of the other two divisions made comparable progress across the fields; Armistead&#x27;s success was not reinforced, and his men were quickly killed or captured.
Pickett&#x27;s Charge was a bloodbath. While the Union suffered 1,500 casualties, the Confederates had over 6,000. Over 50% of the men sent across the fields were killed or wounded. Pickett&#x27;s division alone, out of about 5,500 men, 224 were killed, 1,140 wounded, and 1,499 missing/captured. Pickett&#x27;s three brigade commanders and all thirteen of his regimental commanders were casualties. Kemper was wounded, Garnett killed, and Armistead mortally wounded. Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the entire Confederate assault, the former losing a leg and the latter wounded in the hand and later mortally wounded during the retreat to Virginia. Pickett has received some historical criticism for establishing his final position well to the rear of his troops. Thomas R. Friend, who served Pickett as a courier, defended Pickett by writing that he &quot;went as far as any Major General, commanding a division, ought to have gone, and farther.&quot;

As soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge, Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center, telling returning soldiers that the failure was &quot;all my fault.&quot; Pickett was inconsolable. When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense, Pickett allegedly replied, &quot;General Lee, I have no division.&quot; Pickett&#x27;s official report for the battle has never been found. While it is rumored that Lee rejected it for its bitter negativity and demanded that it be rewritten, an updated version was never filed.

===North Carolina===
After the Battle of Gettysburg, Pickett commanded the Department of Southern Virginia and North Carolina. In February, Pickett was ordered to capture New Bern, North Carolina, from Federal forces. The subsequent Battle of New Bern resulted in a Confederate defeat. Following the battle, Pickett ordered the execution of 22 United States Army soldiers of the 2nd North Carolina Union Volunteer Infantry Regiment who were captured during the failed raid. Confederates claimed they were merely executing deserters. In fact many of the US soldiers put to death offered good evidence that they refused service in the Confederate States Army, serving only in the North Carolina home guard on the basis of refusing to take up arms against the United States. One of the executed soldiers was just 15 years old.

After the war Pickett fled to Canada to escape an investigation into the executions, but he returned to the United States after being promised by General Grant, to public controversy, that he would not face prosecution.

===Overland Campaign and Siege of Petersburg===
Following the New Bern battle, Pickett served as a division commander in the Defenses of Richmond. After P. G. T. Beauregard bottled up Benjamin Butler in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign, Pickett&#x27;s division was detached in support of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s operation in the Overland Campaign, just before the Battle of Cold Harbor, in which Pickett&#x27;s division occupied the center of the defensive line, a place in which the main Union attack did not occur. His division participated in the Siege of Petersburg.

===Battle of Five Forks===
General Pickett had received orders from Robert E. Lee to, with the Cavalry divisions of Major Generals William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and Thomas L. Rosser, hold the vital railroad crossing at Five Forks at all costs. On April 1, at the Battle of Five Forks, their troops were attacked by a combined force under Major General Philip Henry Sheridan, which consisted of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, and the Cavalry Corps of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt. Pickett, W.H.L. Lee, and Rosser were located behind the lines of their troops at the time of the attack, enjoying a shad bake while failing to inform their subordinate officers of their location. Meanwhile, Warren&#x27;s troops overwhelmed Pickett&#x27;s left flank, and the Cavalry troops pinned the Confederates down elsewhere. By the time the Confederate commanders realized the catastrophe, it was too late to prevent the defeat. The result of the battle, as well as that of the Third Battle of Petersburg the following day, forced Lee to abandon his entrenchments at Petersburg, leading to the capture of Richmond and surrender of his army on April 9.

===Relief controversy===
A controversy existed over whether Pickett was relieved of his command in the final days of the war. After the war, Lee&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Walter H. Taylor, wrote that following the Battle of Sayler&#x27;s Creek on April 6, 1865, he had issued orders for Lee relieving Major Generals Richard H. Anderson and Bushrod Johnson, whose forces had been lost in the battle and who thereby no longer had troops under their command. In fact, Anderson had returned to his home in South Carolina following the battle. In addition, Taylor recollected that he had issued an order relieving Pickett as well. Pickett&#x27;s division was still intact, though reduced in number to about the size of a brigade. No copies of these orders exist. Douglas Southall Freeman, a biographer of Lee, supported this assertion, writing in 1935 that at the same time Lee relieved Anderson of command, he took the same action regarding Pickett and Bushrod Johnson, but the order regarding Pickett apparently never reached him. As late as April 11, he signed himself, &quot;Maj. Genl. Commdg.&quot;

In contradiction to this assertion, in his 1870 book &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Men&quot; Walter Harrison reprinted an order from Lieutenant Colonel Taylor to Pickett dated April 10, 1865, in which Taylor addressed Pickett as &quot;Maj Gen G E Picket , General Commanding&quot; The order was a request for an account of the movements and actions of Pickett&#x27;s Division from the time of the Battle of Five Forks on April 1 to the surrender at Appomattox on April 9. In the report Pickett submitted, he said:

Pickett&#x27;s official report to Taylor was signed &quot;G.E. Pickett, Major-Gen., Commd&#x27;g.&quot; This is the April 11 report mentioned by Freeman above. Thus in Pickett&#x27;s official report to Taylor he speaks of commanding his men and interacting with his superior officer right up until the surrender at Appomattox. Taylor attempted to explain the apparent contradiction by telling Fitzhugh Lee that he addressed his request in the manner he did because Pickett was not dismissed from the Army, and for the period in question, Pickett was initially in command. This explanation, however, leaves unanswered the question of how Taylor expected Pickett to answer for the period of time Pickett purportedly was not in command. The explanation does not explain Pickett&#x27;s report which covered the entire period, nor the fact that Pickett signed the report as the acting commander, nor did it explain Longstreet&#x27;s interactions with Pickett over this period of time. Furthermore, there is no record of Taylor requesting reports from any other officers dismissed from the service on the movements of their former troops, nor of his referring to such officers in a manner which would connote active command.

The medical officer of Pickett&#x27;s division, Dr. M. G. Elzey, was with Pickett at the time of these events. When an elderly Colonel John S. Mosby raised this issue in 1911, Elzey wrote a letter to the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; in answer to Mosby:
In Longstreet&#x27;s final report, he makes no mention of Pickett or his division. Nor does Longstreet mention any other officer being in charge of the unit, nor Pickett commanded the men remaining in his division and reported to Longstreet. These men surrendered with Pickett at Appomattox. Regarding Pickett and his division, no source can be produced which asserts anything otherwise.

===Appomattox===
On April 9, Pickett commanded his remaining troops in the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse, forming up in the final battle line of the Army of Northern Virginia. He surrendered with Lee&#x27;s army and was paroled at Appomattox Court House on April 12, 1865.

A legend told by Pickett&#x27;s widow stated that when the Union Army marched into Richmond, she received a surprise visitor. He acted graciously and inquired whether he had found the Pickett house. Abraham Lincoln himself, the story goes, had come to determine the fate of an old acquaintance before the wars, and Sallie, astonished, admitted she was his wife and held out her infant for the president to cradle. Lincoln historian Gerald J. Prokopowicz has called this story a &quot;fantasy&quot;.

==Postwar life==
Pickett&#x27;s execution of 22 captured Union Army soldiers, from North Carolina at New Bern, was then under investigation. Pickett, fearing prosecution, fled with his wife and son to Canada. Testimony at the hearings, including that of wartime North Carolina Governor Zebulon Vance, alleged that at least some of the executed men had belonged to local militias and been unwillingly transferred to the regular Confederate army in &quot;violation of their enlistment agreement,&quot; and thus should not have been treated as deserters and shot. Pickett remained out of the country for a year until hearing that, at the recommendation of Ulysses S. Grant, the investigation had ended. Pickett returned to the United States with his family in 1866 to work as an insurance agent and farmer in Norfolk, Virginia.

On June 23, 1874, House Resolution 3086, an &quot;act to remove the political disabilities of George E. Pickett of Virginia&quot;, was passed by the U.S. Congress. Pickett was granted a full pardon, about a year before his death.

Pickett lamented his men, lost in great number at Gettysburg. Late in his life, Colonel John S. Mosby, who had served under General J. E. B. Stuart, was present when Lee and Pickett met briefly after the war. He claimed their interaction was cold and reserved. Others present at the meeting disputed this, stating Lee only acted in his usual reserved and gentlemanly fashion. Pickett, Mosby said, complained bitterly to him after this meeting that &quot;That man destroyed my division.&quot; Mosby allegedly replied, &quot;Yes, but he made you immortal.&quot; Most historians find the encounter as Mosby interpreted it unlikely. Asked by reporters why Pickett&#x27;s Charge failed, Pickett frequently replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.&quot;

George E. Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875. The cause of death was a liver abscess, although whether it was alcohol-related, amoebic or bacterial is not clear. He was initially interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk. His remains were disinterred on October 23, and he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, on October 24, 1875. More than 40,000 people lined the funeral route, while another 5,000 marched in the funeral procession. A memorial to Pickett was erected over his grave site and dedicated on October 5, 1888. The memorial was not, however, placed directly above Pickett&#x27;s burial site, and the exact location of his remains is not clear.

LaSalle Corbell Pickett died on March 22, 1931, having outlived her husband by more than 55 years. Initially, Hollywood Cemetery declined to allow her to be buried next to her husband. Pickett&#x27;s grandson, Lieutenant George E. Pickett III, threatened to have his grandfather disinterred and moved to Arlington National Cemetery, where both grandparents could be buried side by side. Hollywood Cemetery quickly agreed to permit LaSalle&#x27;s interment at Hollywood, but this did not immediately occur for reasons which are not clear, and LaSalle was cremated and buried at Abbey Mausoleum in Arlington County, Virginia. Originally a mausoleum for the wealthy, it went bankrupt in 1968. The structure fell into disrepair, and it was vandalized many times and several graves desecrated. In early 1998, the Military Order of the Stars and Bars and United Daughters of the Confederacy worked together to pay for LaSalle&#x27;s disinterment and reburial in front of the George E. Pickett Memorial in Hollywood Cemetery. LaSalle Pickett was buried on Saturday, March 21, 1998. She was the first woman interred in the Confederate military burial section.

==Legacy==

Decades after Pickett&#x27;s death, his widow LaSalle (also known as &quot;Sallie&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot;) became a well-known writer and speaker on &quot;her Soldier,&quot; eventually leading to the creation of an idealized Pickett who was the perfect Southern gentleman and soldier. Much controversy attends LaSalle Pickett&#x27;s lionizing of her husband. LaSalle was the author of &quot;Pickett and His Men&quot;, a history of her husband&#x27;s military campaigns, which was published in 1899. She published two other books in her deceased husband&#x27;s name, &quot;The Heart of a Soldier, As Revealed in the Intimate Letters of Gen&#x27;l George E. Pickett&quot; (published in 1913) and &quot;Soldier of the South: General Pickett&#x27;s War Letters to His Wife&quot; (1928). While &quot;Pickett and His Men&quot; has remained a historically valuable document, the latter two writings have been described as &quot;unreliable works that were fictionalized by Pickett&#x27;s wife.&quot; As a result, General Pickett has become a figure partially obscured by &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology.

Pickett today is widely perceived as being a tragic hero of sorts—a flamboyant officer who wanted to lead his troops into a glorious battle, but always missed the opportunity until the disastrous charge at Gettysburg. Historian John C. Waugh wrote of Pickett, &quot;An excellent brigade commander, he never proved he could handle a division.&quot; He quotes George B. McClellan, the Union general, as saying: &quot;Perhaps there is no doubt that he was the best infantry soldier developed on either side during the Civil War.&quot;

Pickett&#x27;s grave is marked by a memorial in Hollywood Cemetery, which was placed there in 1888. A monument to Pickett also stands in the American Camp on San Juan Island, Washington, erected by the Washington University Historical Society on October 21, 1904.

Fort Barfoot in Blackstone, Virginia, was named in his honor, before being renamed on March 24, 2023. It was completed in 1942 and served as an active U.S. Army training facility in World War II and is currently occupied by the Virginia National Guard.

==In popular media==
Actor Stephen Lang portrayed Pickett in the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Billy Campbell portrayed him in the 2003 prequel &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. In a 2003 interview, Lang commented that &quot;for all of Pickett&#x27;s flamboyance, there&#x27;s something organically sad about him. Have you ever looked at any of the portraits of him? You can see it in his eyes, the sadness. He could be charming, but it was tinged with sadness.&quot;

Pickett also appeared in two episodes of the 1985 mini-series &quot;North and South&quot;, depicting him as a cadet at West Point, at which time he was a friend of George Hazard and Orry Main, the two main fictional characters of the series.

Pickett is referenced in &quot;Civilization V: Brave New World&quot;&#x27;s Civil War scenario. Players can receive a promotion that gives a penalty for charging across open terrain.
