<text>Nørager () is a town with a population of 1,145 (1 January 2024) in Rebild municipality in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark. It is the former municipal seat of Nørager Municipality. Nørager is located 15 km from Aars and 26 km from Støvring which is the municipal seat of Rebild Municipality that Nørager now is a part of.

== History ==
In the town lies the manor house Nøragergård, which has been known since the Middle Ages. The farm burned in 2005 and was rebuilt in 2011. After that, Nørager inn is now the oldest standing building in Nørager since it was built in 1891, since there is no church in the town itself.

Nørager had a station on the line Hobro-Aalestrup (1893-1966), which was part of the Himmerlands runways. The station was a little northwest of Nøragergård. In addition to a circulation track there was a loading trail at each end of the station. Nørager Station was still in use in 1966. After closure, it served as a post office and bus service. The warehouse was demolished in 1982 and the rest of the station on Jernbanegade 9 was demolished in 2016 to accommodate a new municipal administration building.
== Nørager Municipality ==

The former Nørager municipality covered an area of 168 km², and had a total population of 5,565 (2005). Its last mayor was Poul Larsen, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Det Konservative Folkeparti&quot;) political party.

On 1 January 2007 Nørager municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Skørping and Støvring municipalities to form the new Rebild Municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 628 km² and a total population of 28,457 (2005).

<text>Skagen () is the northernmost town in Denmark, on the east coast of the Skagen Odde peninsula in the far north of Jutland, part of Frederikshavn Municipality in Nordjylland, north of Frederikshavn and northeast of Aalborg. The Port of Skagen is Denmark&#x27;s main fishing port and it also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting 2 million people annually.

The name was applied originally to the peninsula but it now also refers to the town. The settlement began during the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its herring industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of impressionist artists now known as the Skagen Painters. In 1879, the Skagen Fishermen&#x27;s Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the Skagensbanen railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.

During the early 1910s, Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies. They built a summer residence, Klitgaarden, completed in 1914.

Between the 1930s and 1950s, the town grew rapidly, with the population more than doubling from 4,048 in 1930 to 9,009 in 1955. Skagen reached a maximum population of 14,050 in 1980, after which it gradually declined. As of January 2024, it has a population of 7,476. Thanks to the artistic community that still remains in Skagen, the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries. Chains such as the international jeweller Skagen Designs have branches in the town, and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple in Skagen&#x27;s restaurants.

St Lawrence&#x27;s Church was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century, but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by Skagen Church in 1841 designed by Christian Frederik Hansen. It was redeveloped in 1909–10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgaarden and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including Brøndums Hotel, Skagens Museum, Michael and Anna Ancher&#x27;s House, and Drachmann&#x27;s House.

Skagen&#x27;s first school was the &quot;Latinskole&quot;, a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen, and in 1921, Skagen&#x27;s Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships, and in 1955, the public school &quot;Ankermedets skole&quot; was opened on Skagavej. The main gymnasium of the town, Skagen Kultur- og Fritidscenter, opened in 1972, and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities. Skagen&#x27;s sports centre was completed in 1974, primarily to accommodate badminton and tennis. The local football club, Skagen Idræts Klub, was founded in 1946 and reached the Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in Danish football, as their best position. The Hvide Klit Golf Club is south of the town.

Skagen station is the most northerly railway station in Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen. Nordjyske Jernbaner operates the local train service between Skagen, Frederikshavn and Aalborg with onward national connections by DSB. From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to Gothenburg, Oslo and Læsø. Aalborg Airport is southwest of Skagen.

==History==
===Early history===

Skagen was mentioned as far back as the first century AD by Pliny the Elder:
:&quot;Promenturium Cimbrorum excurrens in maria longe paeninsulam efficit quae Tastris appellatur&quot; (Book IV, 97)
:&quot;The promontory of the Cimbri running far out into the seas makes a peninsula, which is called Tastris.&quot;

This is the only time the name Tastris is mentioned but Skagen itself, first documented as &quot;Skaffuen&quot; in 1284, simply means narrow, high point of land

The first building in the area, dating from the 12th century, was in Højen on the west side of the peninsula. It belonged to Tronder, a shepherd who also became Skagen&#x27;s first fisherman. Around 1340, Vesterby, on the east coast (to the south west of today&#x27;s harbour), developed into the main village. Further to the south west, St Lawrence&#x27;s Church was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1413, Erik of Pommern granted Skagen the status of market town with the result that for a time it became Vendsyssel&#x27;s largest community with up to 2,000 inhabitants.

In 1549, a grammar school was opened (closing again in 1739) and, in 1561, Skagen&#x27;s first lighthouse was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked off the coast of Skagen. In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away. In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand. As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.

===17th–19th centuries===

In the 17th century, fishing suffered from a decline in herring stocks. Shortly after the beginning of the Torstensson War, the Swedish army arrived in Skagen in January 1644, plundering the town. Skagen&#x27;s White Lighthouse with adjoining accommodation for the keeper was built in 1747. In 1775, accumulations of drifting sand made it difficult to access St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, finally leading to its closure and partial demolition in 1795. Its remaining artefacts were sold by auction in 1810. St Lawrence&#x27;s was replaced by Skagen Church, completed in 1841 and redesigned in the local style by Ulrik Plesner in 1910.
On a single day in 1825, 23 ships were left stranded off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, almost half a century before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.

Hans Christian Andersen visited the town in 1859. During his stay at Brøndums Hotel, the future painter Anna Ancher, daughter of the inn-keeper, was born. In 1871, the author Holger Drachmann and the painters Fritz Thaulow and Karl Madsen arrived in Skagen, the first of the colony of artists that became known as the Skagen Painters. They were followed by Carl Locher in 1872, Michael Ancher in 1874 and Peder Severin Krøyer in 1882. 
In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman&#x27;s Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the railway. In 1890, the Skagensbanen narrow-gauge railway from Frederikshavn finally arrived in Skagen, connecting the town to the rest of Denmark. The tracks were widened in 1916 to avoid the need to transfer cargoes of fish in Frederikshavn. Many of the town&#x27;s typical yellow-plastered houses with red roofs that grew up along Sankt Laurentii Vej from 1890 to 1930 were designed by Ulrik Plesner. He was also the architect behind many other buildings in the town, including the railway station, Brøndums Hotel and Skagen Museum. Skagen Missionshus was opened in 1896.

===20th century===
In 1904–7, the fishing harbour was built with inner and outer sections under the patronage of hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun. It was inaugurated on 20 November 1907, and later additions were made for cold storage and the fish processing industry. The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll.

In the early 1910s, Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen in the royal yacht &quot;Kongeskibet Dannebrog&quot;. Occasionally they arrived by train and brought friends from other European monarchies and stayed at the Brøndums and Grenen hotels. They grew fond of the place, befriending many of the artists in Skagen. Christian X bought up land in the vicinity and built the summer residence Klitgaarden as a gift for his wife. Designed by Ulrik Plesner, with furniture provided by Marie Krøyer, the villa was inaugurated on 11 April 1914, with the town celebrating the royal opening with many flags. Klitgaarden was further embellished inside by local artists. It passed to Prince Knud and Princess Caroline Mathilde, and after Caroline&#x27;s death in 1995, it was converted into a villa retreat for scholars in 2000. Composer Carl Nielsen also frequented Skagen in his youth, and he purchased a plot of land on Vestre Strandvej at Vesterby in 1918 with his sculptor wife Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, using one of the two small half-timbered houses there as a residence and studio. They named it &quot;Finis Terrae&quot;, meaning &quot;end of the world&quot;. The Nielsen family owned the property until 1957 when they sold it to Frode Jensen, a machinery manufacturer. 

In the 1930s, development of the town as a tourist attraction led to the opening of new hotels. In 1931, the residents of Skagen and their famous friends campaigned for a monument to be established on the square in the town, commemorating the fishermen and lifeboatmen of Jutland. Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen was commissioned to erect a bronze statue of a lifeboatman in garb, holding a lifeline. The monument was showcased at the Free Exhibition Hall in Copenhagen in the spring of 1931, before fundraising enabled it to be brought by sea to Skagen on 10 November 1932. In October 1938, lightning struck the Skagens Badehotel, affecting the wing with the salons and music rooms. During World War II, the hotel was taken over by the Germans, until it was demolished in 1943. Further facilities were developed in the 1950s. From the 1960s, housing estates were constructed to the north, forming a built-up area extending to Højen. Anna and Michael Ancher&#x27;s house was opened as a museum (1967) and the new town hall was completed in 1969. The Skagen Festival was founded in 1971, making it the oldest music festival in the country. The primary genre is folk music. In 1977, Drachmanns House was broken into and four paintings were stolen, and then in 1980, a painting by Christian Krohg was stolen from Skagens Museum.

Several fires and industrial incidents occurred in the 1980s. In 1981, an oil slick affected the coastline of Skagen municipality, and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at Ankermedet School. Skagen ice factory was affected by a chemical incident in 1989. A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991, while the local cinema was closed in 1993. There was a major fire on the Hulsig Heath dunes in 1996.

==Skagen Painters==
The Skagen Painters were a group of Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until the turn of the century. They were attracted by the scenery, the fishermen and the social community of their fellow artists who encouraged them to paint &quot;en plein air&quot; following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.

The group was reputed to have adopted a bohemian lifestyle. It encompassed not only painters, but also writers, and other influential people. While only a few were full-time residents of the area, they were often joined by family and friends, especially during the summer months. The group initially revolved around Michael Ancher and his wife to be Anna, the only member of the group who was a native of Skagen. P.S. Krøyer, who arrived in 1882, was perhaps the most colourful member of the group. His painting &quot;Hip, Hip, Hurrah!&quot; shows several of the artists celebrating around a table out in the garden. The painters included the Swedes Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén, the Norwegians Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen, and the Danes Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen and Thorvald Niss. The group also included the writers Holger Drachmann, Georg Brandes and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén. They often gathered in Brøndums Hotel whose dining room now forms part of Skagens Museum.

In 1890, the railway to Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists&#x27; colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903. Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, continued to visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum has a large collection of works from all the recognized artists who painted in Skagen.

==Geography==
Skagen is Denmark&#x27;s northernmost town, located north of Frederikshavn, northeast of Aalborg, and northeast of Aarhus by road. It takes its name from the peninsula that projects into the waters between the North Sea and the straits of Denmark. The oldest areas lie along the south coast. Gammel Skagen (Old Skagen), also known as Højen, is located next to &quot;Nordstrand&quot; on the western side. Vesterby and Østerby are notable for their little fishermen&#x27;s cottages and narrow streets. Danish national road 40 to Frederikshavn passes through Skagen.

Grenen (also known as &quot;the Skagen Odde peninsula&quot;) is bordered by Ålbæk Bay (&quot;Ålbæk Bugt&quot;) to the east on the Kattegat and Tannis Bay (&quot;Tannis Bugt&quot;) to the west on the Skagerrak. The area is picturesque, and distinguished by its low, yellow houses with red tile roofs nestled into the beach areas.
The wild landscape was largely formed by a severe process of desertification in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Problems with moving dunes and desertification were subsequently brought under control in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses, bushes and fir trees. Two significant migratory dunes remain in the area, one of which is the enormous Råbjerg Mile.

=== Bird life in Skagen ===
Skagen is the place in Denmark where the most bird species can be experienced, a total of 367 out of 471 bird species in the country.(2017)

Year round the area around Skagen, especially Grenen, is visited by hundreds of birdwatchers from all over Denmark, particularly in April–May and the beginning of June and to a lesser degree in August–November. Furthermore, the area is visited by birdwatchers from Sweden, Norway and Germany.

Other well-visited locations for birdwatchers are Ellekrattet, Nordstrand (near Batterivej), Skagen Harbour, Flagbakken southwest of the town as well as horse fields and brushwood near Fyrvej, Bøjlevejen and Buttervej.

Every day all year round Skagen Bird Observatory observes the migration on Grenen from the highest sand dune located between the parking lot and Grenen: &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;.

Volunteers at Skagen Bird Observatory ring thousands of small birds in the Skagen area every year with permission from the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen.

==Climate==
Being surrounded by the sea in three directions, Skagen has a cool oceanic climate (Cfb) with a lack of temperature extremes. Its maritime and moderated characteristics is shared with the rest of the country. Skagen is Denmark&#x27;s sunniest town with an average of 306 hours of sunshine in the holiday month of July, higher than the 276 hours recorded for Bornholm&#x27;s Østerlars.

==Demographics==
The population of Skagen has mostly grown steadily, reaching a peak of 14,050 people in 1980, but has shown a marked decline in the 21st century. In 1672 Skagen had a population of 1,004, but by 1781 this had declined to 650. The 1801 population of 834 began to grow significantly in subsequent decades, reaching 1,052 people in 1824 and jumping to 1,632 by 1840. By 1850, it had dropped to 1,400, after which it again began to grow steadily. Major growth occurred in the 1870s and 1880s, with the population growing from 1,615 in 1870 to 1,954 in 1880 and 2,323 inhabitants in 1890. Several of the new inhabitants were artists, who significantly altered the ethnic composition of Skagen, as they brought their friends and families from abroad to join the colony at Skagen. Noticeable change occurred between 1901 and 1906, when the population grew from 2,438 to 2,936, and again in the late 1910s, growing from 3,212 in 1916 to 3,854 in 1921. Major growth began to take place in the 1930s and 1940s in Skagen, which grew from 4,048 inhabitants in 1930 to 5,358 in 1940. Skagen&#x27;s population more than doubled between 1930 and 1955 when it reached a population of 9,009. By 1960, Skagen had 10,213 inhabitants, growing to 11,253 in 1965. Following a municipal merger in 1971, the population jumped from 11,749 to 13,513. Thereafter the population grew very steadily, reaching a peak of 14,050 in 1980. There has since been a steady decline, with 13,724 people recorded in 1990, 13,298 in 1994, and 12,691 in 2000. In the 2000s, the permanent population of Skagen has shown a marked decline, falling from 12,213 in 2003 to 8,088 inhabitants in 2017.

==Economy==
For generations, Skagen&#x27;s economy has been based on its fishing industry that continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country&#x27;s main herring processing facility and the world&#x27;s largest fish oil factory. The town&#x27;s evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population that reached 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.

Tourism has now become the town&#x27;s main industry. Initially attracted by its associations with the Skagen Painters, well-to-do visitors sought to benefit from its special light, colour and its fishermen. Their interest led to new hotels, summer houses and expensive villas. The old fishing village was transformed into a miniature city with fine streets lined with boutiques. From the 1960s, it became increasingly fashionable for the upper-classes to spend their summers in Skagen.

Galleries selling local art and reproductions of Skagen&#x27;s most iconic paintings have spread across the town, making it one of the places in Denmark with most galleries. Thanks to the town&#x27;s growing reputation, sailing enthusiasts from Norway, Sweden and Denmark are now also among its frequent visitors. The quality brand name of Skagen has spread far afield, resulting in the establishment of the successful American watch company Skagen Designs that &quot;set out to create a design driven company centred around the welcoming spirit of the city&quot;. Currently a new tourist initiative &quot;The Top of Denmark&quot; targets Skagen as a year-round attraction, not just a summer resort. The harbour is also being adapted to accommodate large international cruise ships. A new 450-meter berth will be completed by 2015 while the existing 170-meter berth will be extended to 200 meters. Skagen now attracts some 2 million visitors a year to its hotels, restaurants, shops and galleries, making tourism a major source of income and employment. An annual attraction is the Skagen Festival, Denmark&#x27;s oldest music festival, which is held the first weekend of July at various venues in Skagen and the harbour area. The largest campsite in the Skagen area is Grenen Camping, situated about northeast of the centre, adjacent to the beach.

Until 2007, Skagen was a municipality in its own right with a substantial local administration. With the reforms of 2007, it became part of Frederikshavn Municipality with a resulting loss in administrative jobs. The Bank of Skagen was established in 1862, and in 1865 a telegraph station was established in the town. The pharmacy opened in 1904, a hospital in 1916, and telephone services were automated in 1956. Ankermedet School was established in 1955. Recently, Skagen has seen developments in the offshore sector with an initiative to assist the Norwegian market through the establishment of Skagen Offshorepark in 2012. On the shipbuilding front, Karstensens Skibsværft continues to prosper with orders for trawlers from Norway.

Currently the harbour is being enlarged in order to accommodate larger vessels, especially cruise ships. From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world&#x27;s top producer of fish meal and fish oil.

===Shops and restaurants===

Thanks to Skagen&#x27;s reputation as an artistic community, the local arts and crafts trade is also an important source of income and employment. Artwork and handicrafts are sold in galleries such as the Galerie Skagen on Trondsvej. Sankt Laurentii Vej, one of the main streets away from the harbour area in Skagen, is a known for its glass and pottery shops; of particular note are Skagen Glasvaerksted, which produces some of &quot;Jutland&#x27;s finest glass pieces&quot;, and Skagen Potteri. In addition to its arts and crafts stores, the town has a wide range of shops, including jewellery, clothes and shoes, handbags, souvenirs, flowers and gardening equipment. There are also a variety of food stores with butchers, bakers, a cheese shop, fishmongers, and several restaurants and cafés. Skagen has a branch of the EuroSpar supermarket, opened in 1998.
Given the abundance of fresh fish coming it at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple of cuisine in Skagen. Of particular note is the Skagen Fiske Restaurant, one of the most renowned seafood restaurants in Jutland that was established in 1907 at the side of the harbour. It serves shrimp, herring, grilled fillets of sole with lemon sauce and Norwegian lobster. Ruth&#x27;s Gourmet in Ruth&#x27;s Hotel on Hans Ruth Vej is also of note and has been cited to be one of the top five restaurants in Denmark outside of Copenhagen, serving French cuisine under head chef Michel Michaud. Ruths Hotel was originally built by Emma and Hans Christian Ruth in 1904 as a bath and guest house. It was purchased by J. Philip-Sørensen in 2003. The Restaurant Pakhuset, the restaurant of the Brøndums Hotel, and Jakobs Café are also popular; Jakobs Café is a music venue and bar at night. True foodies are also bound to visit the famous butcher, Slagter Munch, who is known for their sausages and for their ham: Skagen Skinken.

==Landmarks==

===Northern headland and lighthouses===
At the headland at Grenen, commonly but erroneously believed to be the northernmost point of Denmark, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing line can be seen. As a result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common. These frequent losses combined with the town&#x27;s strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark&#x27;s earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627. A faithful copy has now been constructed on the site of the original.

The White Lighthouse (&quot;det Hvide fyr&quot;) just north of the town is Denmark&#x27;s oldest brick-built lighthouse. With a height of , it was designed by Philip de Lange and lit for the first time in 1747. In 1858, it was replaced by the Grey Lighthouse (&quot;det Grå fyr&quot;) 2 km further north. Restored in 1960, the White Lighthouse now houses art exhibitions.

===Churches===

The old village church from the 14th century is now known as The Sand-Covered Church as only its tower can still be seen. Sand began drifting in from Råbjerg Mile around 1600 and the area surrounding the church became affected by the desertification that destroyed the fields. In 1775, the church door had to be dug free for the congregation to be able to attend the service, and for the following 20 years, the Skageners struggled to keep the church free from sand, without being allowed to close it down. In 1795 the church was closed by royal decree and the body of the church demolished.
 A new church was built in 1841 to the design of Christian Frederik Hansen. The design was adapted in 1909–10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen. Plesner collaborated with Thorvald Bindesbøll on the interior. Anne L. Hansen created interior decorations and a new colour scheme in 1989.
A highlight of the year is the celebration of Midsummer Eve or St. John&#x27;s Evening (&quot;Sankt Hans Aften&quot;) on the beach with blazing bonfire and song.

===Museums===

====Skagens Museum====

Towards the end of the 19th century, Skagen became the summer venue of a group of artists who were attracted by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes. Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.

==== Anchers Hus ====
The former residence of the two painters Anna and Michael Ancher dates from 1884 and was expanded with a studio designed by Ulrik Plesner in 1913. Their only child, Helga Ancher, who died in 1964, left the property to a foundation for conversion into a museum. Opened to the public in 1967, the house contains much of the original furniture, preserving the atmosphere of the artists&#x27; home. Together with the adjacent 18th-century Saxild House (&quot;Saxilds Gaard&quot;), it displays many of the Anchers&#x27; paintings as well as those of their artist friends. Saxild House hosts exhibitions and a museum café

====Drachmanns Hus====
Drachmanns Hus on Hans Baghs Vej in the west of the town is a large property built in 1829. Now a museum, it is dedicated to the writer and marine painter Holger Drachmann who lived in the house from 1902 until his death in a sanatorium in Hornbæk in January 1908. Drachmann had regularly visited Skagen from 1871. Drachmann&#x27;s House, first opened to the public on 4 June 1911, offers a collection not only of his own oil paintings and sketchbooks, but also of paintings from the colony&#x27;s other artists including Krøyer, Tuxen and the Anchers. An annex contains a photographic exhibition about Drachmann. Every year, the house hosts a &quot;Drachmann evening&quot; in which enthusiasts gather together to hear readings, oral presentations and music related to the writer&#x27;s life and works.

====Teddy Bear Museum====
In central Skagen there is a teddy bear museum, &quot;Skagen Bamsemuseum&quot;. The teddy bears on display belong to the private collection of the owner Jonna Thygesen. It is the only teddy bear museum in Scandinavia. Opened in 1998, the collection contains about a thousand bears of all kinds, some of historic value. The museum also has a sculpture garden, an ice café and a teddy bear shop. Special events are arranged at Easter and Christmas.

====Skagen Odde Nature Centre====
The Skagen Odde Nature Centre located close to the northern tip of the peninsula is a museum specially built to allow visitors to see, hear and understand more about the area&#x27;s sand, water, wind and light. Each of the pavilions presents one of these elements in a special atmosphere. Designed by Jørn Utzon, it is the most northerly building on Skagen Odde.

====Skagen Town and Regional Museum====
Skagen Town and Regional Museum (&quot;Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum&quot;), an open-air museum, was opened by the local population in 1927. In 1938 it was moved to the sand dunes of Vesterby. The museum brings together examples of fishermen&#x27;s cottages and the homes of less fortunate inhabitants of Skagen in the middle of the 19th century. There is an old life-saving station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in distress and related nautical artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town&#x27;s history over various periods.

==Education==
Skagen&#x27;s first school was the &quot;Latinskole&quot;, a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and a third in Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (&quot;Borgerskolen&quot;) designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils. A secondary school (&quot;Realskolen&quot;) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended. An additional two-storey wing was completed in 1969.

In 1921, Skagen&#x27;s Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships. It is now the only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool &quot;Ankermedets skole&quot; was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. The private school &quot;Brovandeskolen&quot;, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.

==Sport==
Skagen&#x27;s sports centre dates from 1974 when its large hall was completed. A smaller hall with bedrooms was built in 1999. The centre has facilities for badminton, basketball, handball, hockey and tennis in addition to its football fields. Overnight accommodation is also available. Skagen Idræts Klub, the local football club founded in 1946, plays in Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in Denmark&#x27;s football system. Skagen also has a badminton club and a tennis club, The Hvide Klit Golf Club is located some south of the town on the road to Ålbæk. In season, it is popular with tourists.

==Transport==
=== Railway ===
The Skagen Line connects Skagen with Frederikshavn station in Frederikshavn to the south. Nordjyske Jernbaner operates a frequent train service between Skagen and Frederikshavn with onward connections by train to the rest of Denmark. Skagen station, the most northerly railway station in mainland Denmark, is the principal station of the town. Skagen&#x27;s first station, opened in 1890, was designed by Thomas Arboe. The current building, completed in 1919, is the work of the architect Ulrik Plesner. The western part of Skagen is also served by the Frederikshavnsvej railway halt.

=== Bus ===
In the summer, there are buses from Skagen to Blokhus via Hirtshals.

=== Ferry ===
From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to Gothenburg and Oslo. From Hirtshals, there are ferries to Stavanger, Bergen, Larvik, Faroe Islands and Langesund

=== Airport ===
Aalborg Airport with flights to and from destinations across Europe is located some southwest of Skagen. It can be reached by train, bus or taxi.

=== Road ===
Skagen lies along Danish national road 40, also known as Frederikshavnsvej, which connects the town to Frederikshavn, via Ålbæk to the southeast. The stretch of the road between Skagen and Ålbæk was asphalted in 1932. Hirtshals on the western side of the peninsula can be reached by taking Road 597 from Ålbæk. The Bøjlevejen road is the main skirt road around the town to the north, along which lies the Skagen Odde Nature Centre. In the peak season during the summer months, Skagen can become congested with traffic.

<text>Sindal is a railway town on the island of Vendsyssel-Thy at the top of the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark. It has a population of 3,086 (1 January 2024) and is located in Hjørring Municipality in Region Nordjylland.

Until 1 January 2007 Sindal was also the seat of Sindal Municipality which was merged with existing Hjørring, Løkken-Vrå, and Hirtshals municipalities to form an enlarged Hjørring Municipality.

==History==
The town was originally named &quot;Soldalen&quot;, meaning &quot;Sun Valley&quot;. There is some dispute over when the city was officially founded; the earliest records of the city&#x27;s existence date back to the 18th century, in which the city is described as &quot;Sindal church near the town of Sindal with Housing for the priest, a railroad, and school&quot;. Much of the town&#x27;s growth was a result the Sindal Station, which brought business to the area and was built in 1871.

The town&#x27;s oldest commercial building is the Sindal mill. It had originally been built in the nearby village of Fjeldsted, but was moved to Sindal in 1872 after the railway station was opened. It remained operational as a grain mill until 1947, but after its closure fell into disrepair. Major restorations managed to save the windmill and today it remains the only fully preserved stone-walled mill in Vendsyssel.

In 1976, Sindal Airport opened. The Airport is property of Hjørring Municipality which oversees its operations.

==Religion==
The town&#x27;s original church, referred to as &quot;Old Sindal Church&quot; (Danish: &quot;Sindal Gamle Kirke&quot;), was first built in the 12th century. It has since been renovated and expanded several times. In 1910, Sindal City Church (Danish: &quot;Sindal Bykirke&quot;) was built to accommodate the expanding town. It was designed by Hother A. Paludan in the Neo-Romanesque style. Both congregations belong to the Church of Denmark and are part of the parish of Sindal Sogn within the Diocese of Aalborg.
Sindal Baptist Church (Danish: &quot;Sindal Baptistkirke&quot;) was established in 1905 as a free church.

==Notable people==
* Martin Mortensen (1872 in Sindal – 1953): an American Professor and Head of the Department of Dairy Industry at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa; emigrated to the US in 1893.
* Martinus Thomsen (1890 near Sindal – 1981): a Danish author, philosopher and mystic.
* Jørgen Østergaard (1944 in Sindal): a Danish engineer and former rector at Aalborg University. 
* Rune Kristensen (1986 in Sindal): a professional bicycle mechanic in the UCI World Tour famous for performing the first disc brake bike wheel change in professional cycling.
* Gulli Arason (1950 in Iceland): author and artist, settled in Sindal in 2019.

<doc id="145746" wikidata="Q3413549" url="?curid=145746" title="Skørping">
<text>Skørping is a railway town in Rebild Municipality in Region Nordjylland in the geographic region of the Jutland peninsula known as &quot;Himmerland&quot; in northern Denmark. The modern town has a population of 3,076 as of 1 January 2024.

Skørping is served by Skørping railway station, located on the Randers–Aalborg railway line.

Skørping was the municipal seat of the former Skørping Municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;), until 1 January 2007.

==Skørping Municipality==

The former Skørping municipality covered an area of 238 km2, and had a total population of 9,835 in 2005.

On 1 January 2007 Skørping Municipality ceased to exist as a result of the 2007 &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;). It was merged with Nørager and Støvring municipalities to form the new Rebild Municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 628 km2 and a total population of 28,457 (2005 figures).

==Attractions==
The town is located in the middle of the Rold Forest (&quot;Rold Skov&quot;), Denmark&#x27;s second largest forested area; Lake Madum and Large Oks Lake (&quot;Store Økssø&quot;) lie south of the town of Skørping.

&quot;Rebild Bakker&quot; (&quot;Rebild Hills&quot;) is a national park consisting of heather-covered hills, located in the municipality near the village of Rebild. The area was purchased in 1911 by a group of Americans of Danish descent. The effort was led by Max Henius, a Danish-American biochemist. In 1912 the park was given to the Danish state as a present with three conditions:
* That the area should remain in a natural state;
* That it would be open to the public;
* That Danish-Americans could celebrate American holidays at the park.

The Rebild National Park Society Inc. is an American non-profit company, whose purpose is to arrange an annual Independence Day (4th of July) festival at the park. The first Rebild Festival took place in 1912, when King Christian X spoke to a crowd of 10,000. The day has been celebrated every year since then, with the exception of the periods during World War I and World War II. It is the largest Fourth of July celebration outside the United States, and features speeches by American and Danish politicians, as well as general entertainment.

The park is visited by 400,000 people each year, making it one of Denmark&#x27;s major tourist attractions. It has many hiking trails, and sheep wander loose in the hilly terrain. There is also a full-size reproduction of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s log cabin and a totem pole in the park.

<text>The River Tyne is a river in Scotland. It rises in the Moorfoot Hills in Midlothian near Tynehead to the
south of Edinburgh, at the junction of the B6458 and the B6367. It continues approximately northeast, and empties into the North Sea near Belhaven.

==Origins==
The Tyne is mainly a confluence between the Birns Water and the Tyne Water, about 2 km east of Easter Pencaitland and 1 km south west of Spilmersford Bridge, in the grounds of Saltoun Hall. The Humbie Water is another main headwater.

The Tyne has a number of tributaries:
* Bellyford Burn, rises east of Dalkeith; passes north of Cousland, Midlothian and south of Carberry Hill; south of Elphinstone Tower; north of Ormiston; joins Puddle Burn; joins Tyne Water at Winton House.
* Kinchie Burn, rises east of Pathhead; supplies Glenkinchie Distillery; joins Birns Water at Milton Bridge, West Saltoun.
* Blackford Burn/Belsis Burn/Murray&#x27;s Burn, joins the Tyne Water at Pencaitland.
* Cock Burn, rises at Lower Saltoun, joins the Tyne at Badger Wood.
* Fala Dam Burn, East Water, Salters&#x27; Burn and Blackhouse Burn combine into Keith Water which flows into Humbie Water, south of Humbie Kirk.
* Johnstounburn Water rises near Woodcote Mill and joins Humbie Water near Saltoun Forest.
* Letham Burn and St Laurence House Burn combine to join the Tyne at the southern outskirts of Haddington.
* Bearford Burn rises in Playmuir wood and joins the Tyne at Beanston Mill.
* Old Hailes Burn joins the Tyne at Hailes Castle.
Gallery starts with the Tyne&#x27;s main headwaters: Birns Water, Tyne Water, Humbie Water

<text>The hydrosphere () is the combined mass of water found on, under, and above the surface of a planet, minor planet, or natural satellite. Although Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere has been around for about 4 billion years, it continues to change in shape. This is caused by seafloor spreading and continental drift, which rearranges the land and ocean.

It has been estimated that there are 1.386 billion cubic kilometres (333 million cubic miles) of water on Earth. This includes water in gaseous, liquid and frozen forms as soil moisture, groundwater and permafrost in the Earth&#x27;s crust (to a depth of 2 km); oceans and seas, lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands, glaciers, ice and snow cover on Earth&#x27;s surface; vapour, droplets and crystals in the air; and part of living plants, animals and unicellular organisms of the biosphere. Saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount, whereas fresh water accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic and mountain glaciers; 30.8% is in the form of fresh groundwater; and only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems.

The total mass of Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 1018 tonnes, which is about 0.023% of Earth&#x27;s total mass. At any given time, about 2 × 1013 tonnes of this is in the form of water vapor in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (for practical purposes, 1 cubic metre of water weighs 1 tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth&#x27;s surface, an area of some 361 million square kilometres (139.5 million square miles), is covered by ocean. The average salinity of Earth&#x27;s oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5%).

==History==
According to Merriam Webster, the word hydrosphere was brought into English in 1887, translating the German term &quot;hydrosphäre&quot;, introduced by Eduard Suess.

==Water cycle==


The &quot;water cycle&quot; refers to the transfer of water from one state or reservoir to another. Reservoirs include atmospheric moisture (snow, rain and clouds), streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, groundwater, aquifers, polar ice caps and saturated soil. Solar energy, in the form of heat and light (insolation), and gravity cause the transfer from one state to another over periods from hours to thousands of years. Most evaporation comes from the oceans and is returned to the earth as snow or rain.Sublimation refers to evaporation from snow and ice. Transpiration refers to the expiration of water through the minute pores or stomata of trees. Evapotranspiration is the term used by hydrologists in reference to the three processes together, transpiration, sublimation and evaporation.

Marq de Villiers has described the hydrosphere as a closed system in which water exists. The hydrosphere is intricate, complex, interdependent, all-pervading, stable, and &quot;seems purpose-built for regulating life.&quot; De Villiers claimed that, &quot;On earth, the total amount of water has almost certainly not changed since geological times: what we had then we still have. Water can be polluted, abused, and misused but it is neither created nor destroyed, it only migrates. There is no evidence that water vapor escapes into space.&quot;Every year the turnover of water on Earth involves 577,000 km3 of water. This is water that evaporates from the oceanic surface (502,800 km3) and from land (74,200 km3). The same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation, 458,000 km3 on the ocean and 119,000 km3 on land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface (119,000 − 74,200 = 44,800 km3/year) represents the total runoff of the Earth&#x27;s rivers (42,700 km3/year) and direct groundwater runoff to the ocean (2100 km3/year). These are the principal sources of fresh water to support life necessities and man&#x27;s economic activities.Water is a basic necessity of life. Since two thirds of the Earth is covered by water, the Earth is also called the blue planet and the watery planet. The hydrosphere plays an important role in the existence of the atmosphere in its present form. Oceans are important in this regard. When the Earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of Mercury. Later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere. The gases and water vapor released as the Earth cooled became its present atmosphere. Other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere. As the Earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain. The atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved into the rain water. In turn, this further caused water vapor to condense and fall as rain. This rain water filled the depressions on the Earth&#x27;s surface and formed the oceans. It is estimated that this occurred about 4000 million years ago. The first life forms began in the oceans. These organisms did not breathe oxygen. Later, when cyanobacteria evolved, the process of conversion of carbon dioxide into food and oxygen began. As a result, Earth&#x27;s atmosphere has a distinctly different composition from that of other planets and allowed for life to evolve on Earth.

Human activity has had an impact on the water cycle. Infrastructure, like dams, have a clear, direct impact on the water cycle by blocking and redirecting water pathways. Human caused pollution has changed the biogeochemical cycles of some water systems, and climate change has significantly altered weather patterns. Water withdrawals have exponentially increased because of agriculture, state and domestic use, and infrastructure.

==Recharging reservoirs==
According to Igor A. Shiklomanov, it takes 2500 years for the complete recharge and replenishment of oceanic waters, 10,000 years for permafrost and ice, 1500 years for deep groundwater and mountainous glaciers, 17 years in lakes, and 16 days in rivers.

==Specific fresh water availability==
&quot;Specific water availability is the residual (after use) per capita quantity of fresh water.&quot; Fresh water resources are unevenly distributed in terms of space and time and can go from floods to water shortages within months in the same area. In 1998, 76% of the total population had a specific water availability of less than 5.0 thousand m3 per year per capita. Already by 1998, 35% of the global population suffered &quot;very low or catastrophically low water supplies,&quot; and Shiklomanov predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the twenty-first century with &quot;most of the Earth&#x27;s population living under the conditions of low or catastrophically low water supply&quot; by 2025. Only 2.5% of the water in the hydrosphere is fresh water and only 0.25% of that water is accessible for our use.

==Human impact==
The activities of modern humans have drastic effects on the hydrosphere. For instance, water diversion, human development, and pollution all affect the hydrosphere and natural processes within. Humans are withdrawing water from aquifers and diverting rivers at an unprecedented rate. The Ogallala Aquifer is used for agriculture in the United States; if the aquifer goes dry, more than $20 billion worth of food and fiber will vanish from the world&#x27;s markets. The aquifer is being depleted so much faster than it is replenished that, eventually, the aquifer will run dry. Additionally, only one third of rivers are free-flowing due to the extensive use of dams, levees, hydropower, and habitat degradation. Excessive water use has also caused intermittent streams to become more dry, which is dangerous because they are extremely important for water purification and habitat. Other ways humans impact the hydrosphere include eutrophication, acid rain, and ocean acidification. Humans also rely on the health of the hydrosphere. It is used for water supply, navigation, fishing, agriculture, energy, and recreation.

<text>The Oxcart Library is a non-circulating library located in the North Olmsted branch of the public library in the city of North Olmsted, Ohio, United States, the first in the Western Reserve.

==Origin==
Captain Aaron Olmsted, a wealthy sea captain in the China trade out of New England, was one of 49 investors who formed a syndicate in 1795 to purchase a major part of the Western Reserve from Connecticut. He became the owner of thousands of acres from his $30,000 share of the $120,000 total land deal. The land encompassed the areas now known as North Olmsted, Olmsted Falls and Olmsted Township. At the time of the purchase, the area was known as Lenox. Olmsted traveled west on horseback to visit the land in 1795, but never settled here. He died in 1806.

In 1826, Aaron&#x27;s son, Charles Hyde Olmsted, offered to donate 500 books from his father&#x27;s personal collection in Oxford, Connecticut, if the residents of Lenox agreed to change the name of the area to Olmsted, which they did.

The books traveled by oxcart over 600 miles of rugged terrain. They were individually covered with blue paper and arrived partly stained with mud and rain. The books were housed in various families&#x27; homes and circulated to residents in the area.

==The collection today==
Just over 100 of the original books can be found on display in the North Olmsted Branch of the Cuyahoga County Library. The blue paper covers remain on many of the books. The following books comprise the remaining collection:

<text>This is a list of lighthouses in the United States. The United States has had approximately a thousand lights as well as light towers, range lights, and pier head lights. Michigan has the most lights of any state with over 150 past and present lights. Lighthouses that are in former U.S. territories are not listed here.

Most of the lights in the United States have been built and maintained by the Coast Guard (since 1939) and its predecessors, the United States Lighthouse Service (1910–1939) and the United States Lighthouse Board (1852–1910). Before the Lighthouse Board was established, local collectors of customs were responsible for lighthouses under Stephen Pleasonton. As their importance to navigation has declined and as public interest in them has increased, the Coast Guard has been handing over ownership and in some cases responsibility for running them to other parties, the chief of them being the National Park Service under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000.

*&quot;Note: Click on the state of your choice in the tables below to link you to lighthouses in that state.&quot;


==New England==

===New Hampshire===
The state of New Hampshire only has two lighthouses, both of which are located along the Atlantic coastline.

===Vermont===

*&quot;Note: All entries here show the current tower&#x27;s status; more details can be found in the lighthouse articles.&quot;
==Mid-Atlantic==

==Midwest==


===Colorado===
The state of Colorado has only one lighthouse, the Dillon Reservoir Lighthouse, also known as the Lake Dillon Lighthouse. It is located in the Dillon Reservoir (also referred to as Lake Dillon) in Summit County, Colorado. Although the exact completion date of the 26-foot tall tower is unknown, it was constructed along with the reservoir itself, which was completed in 1963. The lake is at an elevation of 9017 ft (2748 m), making this the highest elevation lighthouse in the U.S.

===Nebraska===
The state of Nebraska has at least two faux lighthouses which were first lit in 1939. There is no evidence that either were used for navigational purposes as the state has no large bodies of water that would require the need. Linoma Lighthouse is located on a privately owned recreation area which was developed around an artificial lake, while Lake Minatare Lighthouse was &quot;built to simulate a lighthouse&quot;. Also of note is a faux lighthouse called Rock Garden Lighthouse (not listed below), located in Kearney.

==Notes==
:A. The shortest lighthouse in Massachusetts is either Palmer Island Light at or Brant Point Light at . Sources remain split on this issue, with at least one claiming the latter as the shortest in New England.
:B. The Perry Monument in Ohio and the Statue of Liberty in New York City are not classified as lighthouses. They would come in as the two tallest lighthouses in the United States otherwise.
:C. Minnesota Point Light was built in 1858, but only half of the now ruined tower remains.
:D. The oldest light station is Pottawatomie Light which was established in 1836; however, the current buildings date to 1858.
:E. The shortest height is for a skeletal tower which was placed in 1981. For &quot;traditional&quot; lighthouses, Point Retreat Light and Cape Spencer Light are tied at each.
:F. These two lighthouses are tied at each.
:G. The oldest lighthouse in Hawaii was called &quot;Lahaina Lighthouse&quot;, which was built in 1905 before it was replaced. Moloka&#x27;i Light is the oldest currently standing lighthouse; it was first lit a month before the still standing Makapuu Point Light.
:H. Pass A L&#x27;Outre Light was originally constructed in 1852 elsewhere and moved to its present location.
:I. Cat Island Light (first tower), Pass Christian Light, and Ship Island Light were all 30 feet tall.

<text>Longships Lighthouse is an active 19th-century lighthouse about off the coast of Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall, England. It is the second lighthouse to be built on Carn Bras, the highest of the Longships islets which rises above high water level. In 1988 the lighthouse was automated, and the keepers withdrawn. It is now remotely monitored from the Trinity House Operations &amp; Planning Centre in Harwich, Essex.

==History==
In the second half of the 18th century, Trinity House was petitioned repeatedly by ship owners for a lighthouse to be built on one of the rocks off Land&#x27;s End. In 1790 John Smeaton surveyed the area, and recommended either Wolf Rock or the Longships reef as potentially suitable locations. Trinity House sought a leaseholder, who would be responsible for building the tower and maintaining the light in return for the right to levy dues on passing ships. The lease was eventually granted, for a period of fifty years, to a Lieutenant Henry Smith (who had previously been involved in trying to establish a beacon on the rocks). He engaged Samuel Wyatt, who had recently been appointed the Surveyor of Trinity House, as architect for the project. Work on site began in 1793; however, Smith underestimated the time required and costs involved, and struggled to raise sufficient funds (since the levying of dues depended on the lighthouse being operational). He took out expensive loans to see the work through, but was unable to repay them as promised; (he ended up being sent to the Fleet Prison as a debtor in 1801).

===The first lighthouse===

Smith&#x27;s lighthouse was first lit on 29 September 1795. Built to Wyatt&#x27;s design, it was a round tower, three storeys high and built of granite, on top of which was a glazed lantern storey with a copper-covered dome. Within the tower itself, the lower level contained a water tank and coal store, the middle floor housed the oil tanks and a kitchen, while the top floor served as a bedroom. The lantern contained a fixed array of eighteen Argand lamps with reflectors, arranged in two tiers and shining out to sea, probably the first time Argand lamps and reflectors had been installed in an offshore lighthouse. The tower was only just over high, but was built on top of a rock pinnacle meaning that the lantern was above sea level; nevertheless very high seas obscured its light. In the early 19th century it was manned by two teams of two keepers, each team being on station for a month at a time.
In 1836, Trinity House bought out the lease of the Longships (and other remaining privately-owned lighthouses). The Corporation built a set of keepers&#x27; dwellings onshore, near Sennen Cove, in 1855, facing the lighthouse out to sea; keepers&#x27; families lived there, as did the keepers themselves when not on station. By this time there were still four keepers, but three now manned the lighthouse while one (by monthly rotation) was ashore.

===The current lighthouse===

In 1869 Trinity House began constructing a replacement tower to the designs of William Douglass. The building of the present granite tower used much of the equipment that had previously been used in the construction of the Wolf Rock Lighthouse; construction was supervised by Michael Beazeley, who had been assistant engineer to Douglass at Wolf Rock. The new lighthouse was just over tall. It was equipped with a first-order fixed catadioptric optic built by Dr John Hopkinson of Chance Brothers. The lens array, itself over tall, was placed on a pedestal within the lantern; the light source was an eight-wick &#x27;Douglass&#x27; oil lamp, powered by colza.

The tower was first lit in December 1873, having cost £43,870 to build, and displayed a fixed white light with two red sectors (to warn ships away from the Brisons, to the north-east, and Rundlestone, to the south-east). Initially the new lighthouse was fitted with a fog bell, which sounded two strokes every fifteen seconds; After the new tower was completed Wyatt&#x27;s tower was dismantled and the higher pinnacles of rock on Carn Bras were removed.

In 1883 Longstone was altered to show an occulting light (eclipsed for three seconds every minute). An explosive fog signal was introduced at the same time, using Brock fog rockets to sound a signal twice every ten minutes. The bell was retained for use as an alternative signal, put to use if the explosive signal was not working, until 1897 when it was removed. Even after these improvements, however, the &quot;S.S. Bluejacket&quot; was wrecked on rocks near the lighthouse on a clear night in 1898, nearly demolishing the lighthouse in the process. Often due to bad weather there was a delay in relieving the men and supplying stores. In January 1901 there was some concern that the men had run short of provisions due to the severe weather. It was found that there was plenty of stores and the only hardship was their lack of tobacco. They had taken to smoking coffee, hops and tea leaves instead. The explosive signal was altered to sound twice every five minutes in 1899.
In 1904 the multi-wick lamp was replaced with a Matthews incandescent oil burner. A new Matthews-designed explosive fog signal apparatus was also installed on the lantern gallery at around the same time. In 1925 the lamp was again replaced, this time with a Hood petroleum vapour burner.

In 1967 the light was electrified and the tower modified: the 1873 optic was removed and in its place a pair of Lister diesel generator sets were installed on the old lamp room floor (occupying the lower part of the lantern). Above them an additional floor was inserted to support a new (reduced height) first-order dioptric optic, with an electric lamp replacing the old paraffin burner. It displayed an isophase light (one long five-second flash every ten seconds) and was visible up to distant. At the same time, the explosive fog signal was removed and a &#x27;supertyfon&#x27; fog horn was installed: compressed air was provided by a pair of Worthington-Simpson compressor units to three sounders, each placed alongside its own air tank on the lantern gallery.
In 1974 a helipad was constructed on top of the lantern, greatly easing access.

In 1988 the lighthouse was automated: the keepers were withdrawn, a new set of generators was installed and the fog horn was replaced by a new electric emitter. It was initially monitored by a telemetry link from the Lizard Lighthouse; since 1996 it has been monitored from Harwich.

==Operation==
The light was converted to solar power in 2005; it now flashes twice every ten seconds. Seaward flashes are white but they become red – due to tinted sectors – for any vessel straying too close to either Cape Cornwall to the north or Gwennap Head to the south-southeast. 
The white light has a range of , and the red sector light a slightly shorter range of . During poor visibility the fog horn sounds once every ten seconds.

<doc id="145768" wikidata="Q7571483" url="?curid=145768" title="Southwold Lighthouse">
<text>Southwold Lighthouse is a lighthouse operated by Trinity House in the centre of Southwold in Suffolk, England. It stands on the North Sea coast, acting as a warning light for shipping passing along the east coast and as a guide for vessels navigating to Southwold harbour.

The lighthouse, which is a prominent local landmark, was commissioned in 1890, and was automated and electrified in 1938. It survived a fire in its original oil-fired lamp just six days after commissioning and today operates a 180-watt main navigation lamp. This lamp has a range of .

== History ==

Construction of the lighthouse began in 1887, led by Sir James Douglass, Engineer in Chief of Trinity House. A light was lit on a temporary structure in February 1889 and the lighthouse itself began operating on 3 September 1890. Previously, three fixed lights had been displayed from the cliff at Southwold; these were now discontinued. Both the lantern (the uppermost part of the structure) and the optic (a first-order fixed Fresnel lens), had originally been built by Chance Brothers in 1868 for Happisburgh Low Lighthouse; they became available for re-use when the latter light was demolished in 1883.
The light was initially powered by a six-wick Argand oil burner; it displayed a group occulting characteristic (the light being eclipsed twice every 20 seconds) and had a visible range of . The light was white, but shone red across defined sectors to the north and to the south (indicating the Barnard sands and Sizewell Bank respectively); in addition, &#x27;spare&#x27; light, which would otherwise have shone needlessly westwards, was diverted by way of vertical condensing prisms so as to intensify these red sectors.

Just six days after the light was commissioned there was a fire in the lighthouse with the burner being destroyed. The inexperience of the new lighthouse keepers was blamed for the fire.

The burner was replaced with an oil-fired light in 1906 and a petroleum burner in 1923. The light was electrified and automated in 1938, at which time the light characteristic was changed to group flashing, 6 flashes every 20 seconds (modified to 4 flashes in 1965). It was converted to battery operation, with the batteries charged using mains electricity, in 2001. Until 2013 a cluster of three 90-watt Osram Halostar lamps provided the main light within the optic (which had a range of ).

The lighthouse, along with Lowestoft Lighthouse to the north, was threatened with closure by Trinity House in 2005, with shipping companies increasingly using satellite navigation systems rather than relying on lighthouses. Both lighthouses were reprieved in 2009 following a review by Trinity House that found that satellite navigation systems were not yet sufficiently reliable.
Then in December 2012, the range of Southwold&#x27;s light was increased to , to compensate for the imminent closure of Orfordness Lighthouse (which took place in June 2013). This was achieved by installing a new main light: a BLV Topspot 90 Volt Metal Halide 150-watt lamp placed within a small revolving optic. To make space for it within the lantern room the upper prismatic section of the old optic was removed (one section was put on display at the foot of the tower, another was loaned to Happisburgh Lighthouse where it has been put on display not far from its original location). The central and lower sections of the old lens, together with its lamp, have been retained for use as an emergency backup.

== Current display ==

Since January 2016 a 180-watt revolving MFR (LED reflector) lamp manufactured by Mediterraneo Sanales Maritimas has been in use as the main lamp. The current light characteristic is one white flash every 10 seconds (Fl(1).W.10s) visible between 204°–032.5°. The white light is used for general navigation. Red sectors, previously used to mark shoals to the north and offshore sandbanks at Sizewell to the south, were removed as part of the 2012 refit.

== Buildings ==

The lighthouse is tall, standing above sea level. It is built of brick and painted white, and has 113 steps around a spiral staircase. Two keeper&#x27;s cottages were built next to the lighthouse rather than living quarters being made in the lighthouse itself.

The lighthouse is a Grade II listed building. Guided visits are, from 2023, run by the Adnams brewery, which stands nearby, and may be booked via that company&#x27;s website.
The lighthouse was the site of charity abseil events in 2009, 2011 and 2013. The events raised money for the Southwold lifeboat operated by the RNLI from Southwold harbour.

== Cultural references ==
The lighthouse has featured in television programmes, including an episode of &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot; and the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Grandpa in My Pocket&quot;. It also appears in the art house movie &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot;, directed by Peter Greenaway. Adnams brewery, which operates from the town, has named a pale ale &quot;Lighthouse&quot; in recognition of the importance of the lighthouse as a landmark in Southwold and has featured the lighthouse on promotional material.

<doc id="145771" wikidata="Q831515" url="?curid=145771" title="Lightship">
<text>A lightvessel, or lightship, is a ship that acts as a lighthouse. They are used in waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable for lighthouse construction. Although some records exist of fire beacons being placed on ships in Roman times, the first modern lightship was located off the Nore sandbank at the mouth of the River Thames in London, England, by its inventor Robert Hamblin in 1734. Lightships have since been rendered obsolete by advancing lighthouse construction techniques, and by large automated navigation buoys.

==Construction==

The most important element of lightship design is a tall mast upon which to mount the light. Initially, these lights consisted of oil lamps that were run up the mast and could be lowered for servicing, while later vessels carried fixed lamps which were serviced in place. As they became available, Fresnel lenses were used, and many vessels housed them in smaller versions of lighthouse lanterns. Some lightships had two masts, with the second housing a reserve beacon, in case of the main light&#x27;s failure.

Initially, lightship hulls were constructed of wood, shaped like the small merchant ships of the time, but this proved unsatisfactory for a permanently anchored ship, so the shape of the hull evolved to reduce rolling and pounding. As iron and steel hulls were popularized, they became used in lightvessels, and the advent of steam and diesel power led to self-propelled and electrically lit designs. Earlier vessels had no propulsion systems and had to be towed to and from their positions.

Much of the ship was taken up by storage for lamp oil and other supplies, as well as crew accommodations. The crew&#x27;s primary duty was to maintain the light; additional responsibilities included keeping records of passing ships, observing the weather, and occasionally performing rescues.

In the early 20th century, some lightships were fitted with warning bells mounted on their structure or lowered into the water, to warn of danger in poor visibility and to permit a crude estimation of the lightship&#x27;s location relative to the approaching vessel. Tests conducted by Trinity House found that sound from a bell submerged some could be heard at a distance of , with a practical range in operational conditions of .

===Mooring===
Holding the vessel in position was an important aspect of lightvessel engineering. Early lightships used fluke anchors, which are still in use on many contemporary vessels, though these anchors are prone to dragging, making their performance unsatisfactory in rough seas. 

Since the early 19th century, lightships have used mushroom anchors, named for their shape, which typically weigh 3 to 4 tons. The first lightvessel equipped with one was a converted fishing boat, renamed &quot;Pharos,&quot; meaning lighthouse, which entered service on September 15th, 1807, near Inchcape, Scotland with an anchor weighing 1.5 tons. The introduction of cast iron anchor chains in the 1820s improved their effectiveness dramatically, with the rule of thumb being of chain for every foot of water.

===Appearance===


Early lightvessels were equipped with day markers at the tops of their masts, which were the first objects seen from an approaching ship. These operated both at night and in fog, from one hour before sunset to one hour after sunrise, and were in addition to the lights. The markers were primarily red and occasionally white, and their designs varied. Filled circles or globes, as well as pairs of inverted cones were the most common designs among them.

For visibility purposes, most later lightships had bright red hulls that displayed the name of the station in white, upper-case letters; relief light vessels displayed the word RELIEF instead. Some vessels had hulls coloured for specific purposes. For example, the Huron Lightship was painted black since she was assigned the black buoy side of the entrance to the Lake Huron Cut. From 1854 until 1860, the lightvessel that operated at Minots Ledge, Massachusetts, had a light yellow hull, to increase contrast between the blue-green seas and the hills behind it.

==Lightvessel service==
===British lightships===

David Avery and Robert Hamblin in 1731 placed the earliest British lightship at The Nore near the mouth of the River Thames. This was a private venture that operated profitably and without the need for government enforcement of payment for lighting services.

Further vessels were placed off Norfolk in 1736, at Owers Bank in Sussex in 1788, and at the Goodwin Sands in 1793.

Over time, Trinity House, the public authority charged with establishing and maintaining lighthouses in England and Wales, crowded out the private light vessels. Trinity House is now responsible for all the remaining lightvessels England and Wales, of which there are currently eight unmanned lightvessels and two smaller light floats.

In the 1930s, &quot;crewless lightships&quot; were proposed as a way to operate a light vessel for six to twelve months without a crew.

The first lightvessel conversion to solar power was made in 1995, and all vessels except the &#x27;20 class&#x27; have now been converted. The &#x27;20 class&#x27; is a slightly larger type of vessel that derives its power from diesel electric generators. Where a main light with a visible range in excess of 20 nautical miles (37 km) is required, a &#x27;20 class&#x27; vessel is used, as the main light from a Trinity House solar lightvessel has a maximum range of 19 nautical miles (35 km).

Hull numbers: 19, 22, 23 and 25 (the 20 class); 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 17 (solar lightvessels); and LF2 and LF3 (solar lightfloats).

The Spurn Lightship, operated by the Humber Conservancy Board, was launched in 1927 and served for 48 years. It is now preserved as a museum ship and is moored at Hull marina.
===American lightships===
====History====
The first United States lightship was established at Chesapeake Bay in 1820, and the total number around the coast peaked in 1909 with 56 locations marked. Of those ships, 168 were constructed by the United States Lighthouse Service and six by the United States Coast Guard, which absorbed it in 1939. From 1820 until 1983, there were 179 lightships built for the U.S. government, and they were assigned to 116 separate light stations on four coasts (including the Great Lakes).

The first United States lightships were small wooden vessels with no propelling power. The first United States iron-hulled lightship was stationed at Merrill&#x27;s Shell Bank, Louisiana, in 1847. Wood was still the preferred building material at the time because of lower cost and ability to withstand shock loading. Wooden lightships often survived more than 50 years in northern waters where the danger of rotting was reduced. Lightvessel 16 guarded Sandy Hook and Ambrose stations for more than 80 years; she had both an inner hull and an outer hull with the space between filled with salt to harden the wood and reduce decay. Several lightships built with composite wood and steel hulls in 1897 proved less durable than either wood or steel. The first modern steel lightship in United States service was lightvessel 44 built in 1882. One of the last United States wooden hulled lightships built, lightvessel 74, went into service at Portland, Maine, in 1902. The first United States lightships with steam engine propulsion were built in 1891 for service on the Great Lakes where seasonal ice required prompt evacuation of light stations to avoid destruction of the lightships.

The official use of lightships in the United States ended on March 29, 1985, when the United States Coast Guard decommissioned its last such ship, the &quot;Nantucket I&quot;. Many lightships were replaced with Texas Towers or large navigational buoysboth of which are cheaper to operate than lightvessels. In fact, lighthouses often replaced lightships.

====Naming and numbering====
Up to and through the Civil War lightships were identified by name, usually that of the station where they served, but as they were moved from station to station, the keeping of records became confusing. In 1867 all existing lightships were given numbers by which they would be permanently identified, and the station at which they were presently serving was painted on their sides, to be changed as needed. Lightships held in reserve to serve in place of those in dock for maintenance were labeled &quot;RELIEF&quot;. Surviving lightships are commonly taken to be named according to these labels, but for instance the &quot;Lightship &quot;Chesapeake&quot;&quot; actually served at two other stations as well as being used for examinations, and last served at the Delaware Light Station. In another case, the &quot;LV-114&quot; was labeled &quot;NEW BEDFORD&quot;, though there has never been such a station. In an attempt to sort out the early lightships, they were assigned one or two letter designations sometime around 1930; these identifications do not appear in early records, and they are to some degree uncertain.

There are three different and overlapping series of hull numbers. The Lighthouse Service assigned numbers beginning with &quot;LV-&quot; and starting from 1; however, not all numbers were used. When the Coast Guard took over the lighthouse service, all existing lightships were renumbered with &quot;WAL-&quot; prefixes, beginning with &quot;WAL-501&quot;. In 1965 they were renumbered again, this time with &quot;WLV-&quot;; however in this case the numbers given were not sequential. Given that only six vessels were constructed after the Coast Guard takeover, the &quot;LV-&quot; series numbers are most commonly used.

====Surviving American lightships====
It is estimated that there are 15 United States lightships left today. Among them:

* The lightship Barnegat (LV-79) is moored in Camden, New Jersey. She was the lightship for Five Fathom Bank and Barnegat, New Jersey.
* The lightship Swiftsure (LV-83) is moored at Northwest Seaport in Seattle, Washington. She served at all five Pacific Coast lightship stations (Blunts Reef and San Francisco, California; and the Columbia River entrance, Umatilla Reef, and Swiftsure Bank, Washington).
* The lightship Ambrose (LV-87) is moored at the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City, New York.
* The lightship Portsmouth (LV-101) is moored at the naval shipyard museum in Portsmouth, Virginia. LV-101 was built in 1915 by Pusey &amp; Jones. She first served at Cape Charles, Virginia, then Relief, Overfalls, Delaware, and Stonehorse Shoal, Massachusetts. After being decommissioned, she was stored in Portland, Maine, before being sold to the museum. Today LV-101 is dry docked and lettered as &quot;Portsmouth&quot;, having never served there.
* The lightship Huron (LV-103) is one of many that have plied the waters of the Great Lakes. In 1832 the first Lightship on the Great Lakes—the Lois McLain—was placed at Waugoshance Shoal. After 1940, the Huron was the last lightship on the Great Lakes. She was decommissioned in 1970 and grounded at Port Huron, Michigan as a museum. The smallest surviving lightship, she is now a museum and a representative of the 96 foot class.
* The lightship Winter Quarter (LV-107) is moored at Liberty Landing Marina in Jersey City, New Jersey. She serves as the office building for a sailing school. 
* The lightship Nantucket (LV-112) is moored in Boston, Massachusetts.
* The lightship Frying Pan (LV-115) is moored at Pier 66 in New York City, New York.
* The lightship Chesapeake (LV-116) is moored at Historic Ships in Baltimore in Baltimore, Maryland.
* The lightship Overfalls (LV-118) is moored in Lewes, Delaware. She has been painted for the &quot;OVERFALLS&quot; station, though she never served there.
* The lightship Columbia (WLV-604) is moored at the Columbia River Maritime Museum in Astoria, Oregon. The first lightship on the Pacific Coast, she marked the entrance to the Columbia River.
* The lightship Relief (WLV-605) is moored at Jack London Square in Oakland, California.
* The lightship Nantucket I (WLV-612) is moored in New Bedford, Massachusetts. She operates as a floating hotel and events venue. Built in 1950 and operated at various stations from 1951 to 1983, she was designated &quot;Nantucket I&quot; in 1979 and rotated at the Nantucket station with the &quot;Nantucket II&quot; until 1983. She was the last American lightship to be decommissioned in 1985.
* The lightship Nantucket II (WLV-613) is moored in New Bedford, Massachusetts. She was the last lightship built in the United States and was laid down on February 4, 1952, at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. She was launched six months later and placed in service in September of the same year. Her first assignment was to the Ambrose Shoals off New York City and served at that station until 1967. After brief service as a relief lightship, she was assigned as one of two Nantucket lightships and served at that station until replaced by a buoy on December 20, 1983. She was moored at the Wareham Shipyard in Wareham, Massachusetts from about 1990 until 2014.

===German lightships===
There are currently three identical unmanned German lightvessels in service, named FS1, FS3 and FS4. The initialism &quot;FS&quot; is short for &quot;Feuerschiff&quot;, which means &quot;lightvessel&quot; in German. Two of them are normally located at:
# German Bight (&quot;GB&quot; in charts and notices, &quot;G—B&quot; on vessels)
# German Bight Western Approach (&quot;GW/EMS&quot;)

Both positions have the same characteristics:
* white isophase light with a cycle period of 8s at 12m elevation and a range of 17 nautical miles

All three ships are operated by the Waterways and Shipping Office Wilhelmshaven and can be seen in the harbour of Wilhelmshaven during maintenance.

===Russian lightships===
In Russia, lightships have been documented since the mid 19th century. The lightvessel service was subordinated to the Russian Hydrographic Office and most of the lightships under it were in the Baltic Sea. In the early 1900s there were about ten lightships in the Russian sector of the Baltics. Among these the following may be mentioned:

&quot;Yelaginsky&quot;, located on the Yelagin Channellater moved to the Petrovsky Channel and renamed, &quot;Nevsky&quot; in the middle of the main channel to St. Petersburg, and &quot;Londonsky&quot; on Londonsky Shoal off Kotlin Island on the approach to Kronstadt. Other Baltic lightships were located further to the West, with &quot;Werkommatala&quot; by Primorsk (Koivisto) harbour, &quot;Lyserortsky&quot; at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland, and &quot;Nekmangrund&quot; over the treacherous shoals off Hiiumaa Island&#x27;s NW shore, known as Hiiu Madal in Estonian.

Another well-known lightship was &quot;Irbensky&quot; of the Soviet Union era. It was the next-to-last Russian lightship. Having been located in the Baltic in the 1980s, it was briefly renamed &quot;Ventspilssky&quot; while serving near Ventspils port in the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic.

The last Russian lightvessel in service was &quot;Astrakhansky-priyomniy&quot;, of the same class as Irbensky. Until 1997 she was marking the deepwater channel leading to Astrakhan harbour while it was doing service in the Caspian Sea.

=== Other countries ===
*The Australian lightship &quot;Carpentaria&quot;, an unmanned lightvessel (effectively a floating lighthouse) built during 1916–17 in Sydney, operated in the Gulf of Carpentaria, off Sandy Cape, Queensland, and in the Bass Strait. After her career ended in 1985, she was donated to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 1987 for preservation.

==Lost lightships==
Because lightvessels must remain anchored in specific positions for the majority of their time at sea, they are more at risk of damage or destruction. Many lightships have been lost in hurricanes.
;United States
* Lightship No. 84 ( long, weighing 683 tons), lies sunk since 1997 in a shallow section of New York Harbor and its two masts are still visible above the surface.
* Lightship LV-82 &quot;Buffalo&quot; foundered in Lake Erie near Buffalo, during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 with the loss of six lives. See Shipwrecks of the 1913 Great Lakes storm and List of victims of the 1913 Great Lakes storm.
* Lightship No. 61 &quot;Corsica Shoals&quot; was destroyed in the same storm on Lake Huron as Lightship 82. See Huron Lightship for further details.
* LV-6 and LV-73 were both lost with all hands.
* The Nantucket Lightship LV-117 was rammed and sunk in 1934 by RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; homing in on its radio beacon, with a loss of three out of a crew of eleven.
* Lightship No. 114 (WAL-536), built by Albina Engine &amp; Machine Works, served as an active lightship from 1930 to 1971. Her last assignment was at Portland, Maine. In 1975, she was purchased by the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts and had &quot;NEW BEDFORD&quot; painted on her sides (despite the fact there never was a New Bedford lightship). She was never adequately maintained and her hull decayed due to years of neglect. She remained in New Bedford until she sank at her mooring on May 31, 2006. She was deemed beyond repair and was sold for scrap.

==Popular culture==

<text>A food web is the natural interconnection of food chains and a graphical representation of what-eats-what in an ecological community. Position in the food web, or trophic level, is used in ecology to broadly classify organisms as autotrophs or heterotrophs. This is a non-binary classification; some organisms (such as carnivorous plants) occupy the role of mixotrophs, or autotrophs that additionally obtain organic matter from non-atmospheric sources.

The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that link an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of consumer–resource interactions that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging, and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.

Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book &quot;Animal Ecology&quot;; Elton&#x27;s &#x27;food cycle&#x27; was replaced by &#x27;food web&#x27; in a subsequent ecological text. Elton organized species into functional groups, which was the basis for Raymond Lindeman&#x27;s classic and landmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics. Lindeman emphasized the important role of decomposer organisms in a trophic system of classification. The notion of a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin and his terminology, including an &quot;entangled bank&quot;, &quot;web of life&quot;, &quot;web of complex relations&quot;, and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he talked about &quot;the continued movement of the particles of earth&quot;. Even earlier, in 1768 John Bruckner described nature as &quot;one continued web of life&quot;.

Food webs are limited representations of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into trophic species, which are functional groups of species that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in quantitative (or mathematical representation) models of trophic or consumer-resource systems dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns in the structure of real food web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the topological structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in meta analysis are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using network theory had identified patterns that are common to all. Scaling laws, for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of species richness.

==Taxonomy of a food web==


Links in food webs map the feeding connections (who eats whom) in an ecological community. &quot;Food cycle&quot; is an obsolete term that is synonymous with food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun&#x27;s energy or by capturing the sun&#x27;s energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.

The base or basal species in a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or saprophytic detritivores (i.e., the community of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer is a measure of food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.

Linkages connect to nodes in a food web, which are aggregates of biological taxa called trophic species. Trophic species are functional groups that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Common examples of an aggregated node in a food web might include parasites, microbes, decomposers, saprotrophs, consumers, or predators, each containing many species in a web that can otherwise be connected to other trophic species.

===Trophic levels===


Food webs have trophic levels and positions. Basal species, such as plants, form the first level and are the resource-limited species that feed on no other living creature in the web. Basal species can be autotrophs or detritivores, including &quot;decomposing organic material and its associated microorganisms which we defined as detritus, micro-inorganic material and associated microorganisms (MIP), and vascular plant material.&quot; Most autotrophs capture the sun&#x27;s energy in chlorophyll, but some autotrophs (the chemolithotrophs) obtain energy by the chemical oxidation of inorganic compounds and can grow in dark environments, such as the sulfur bacterium &quot;Thiobacillus&quot;, which lives in hot sulfur springs. The top level has top (or apex) predators that no other species kills directly for their food resource needs. The intermediate levels are filled with omnivores that feed on more than one trophic level and cause energy to flow through several food pathways starting from a basal species.

In the simplest scheme, the first trophic level (level 1) is plants, then herbivores (level 2), and then carnivores (level 3). The trophic level equals one more than the chain length, which is the number of links connecting to the base. The base of the food chain (primary producers or detritivores) is set at zero. Ecologists identify feeding relations and organize species into trophic species through extensive gut content analysis of different species. The technique has been improved through the use of stable isotopes to better trace energy flow through the web. It was once thought that omnivory was rare, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. This realization has made trophic classifications more complex.

===Trophic dynamics and multitrophic interactions===
The trophic level concept was introduced in a historical landmark paper on trophic dynamics in 1942 by Raymond L. Lindeman. The basis of trophic dynamics is the transfer of energy from one part of the ecosystem to another. The trophic dynamic concept has served as a useful quantitative heuristic, but it has several major limitations including the precision by which an organism can be allocated to a specific trophic level. Omnivores, for example, are not restricted to any single level. Nonetheless, recent research has found that discrete trophic levels do exist, but &quot;above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.&quot;

A central question in the trophic dynamic literature is the nature of control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, decomposer). Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of ecological control mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or &#x27;green-world&#x27; hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the nutritional quality or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control. Recent studies have concluded that both &quot;top-down&quot; and &quot;bottom-up&quot; forces can influence community structure and the strength of the influence is environmentally context dependent. These complex multitrophic interactions involve more than two trophic levels in a food web. For example, such interactions have been discovered in the context of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and aphid herbivores that utilize the same plant species. 

Another example of a multitrophic interaction is a trophic cascade, in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent overgrazing by suppressing herbivores. Links in a food-web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the trophic levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food-web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food-web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.

The field of chemical ecology has elucidated multitrophic interactions that entail the transfer of defensive compounds across multiple trophic levels. For example, certain plant species in the &quot;Castilleja&quot; and &quot;Plantago&quot; genera have been found to produce defensive compounds called iridoid glycosides that are sequestered in the tissues of the Taylor&#x27;s checkerspot butterfly larvae that have developed a tolerance for these compounds and are able to consume the foliage of these plants. These sequestered iridoid glycosides then confer chemical protection against bird predators to the butterfly larvae. Another example of this sort of multitrophic interaction in plants is the transfer of defensive alkaloids produced by endophytes living within a grass host to a hemiparasitic plant that is also using the grass as a host.

===Energy flow and biomass===


Food webs depict energy flow via trophic linkages. Energy flow is directional, which contrasts against the cyclic flows of material through the food web systems. Energy flow &quot;typically includes production, consumption, assimilation, non-assimilation losses (feces), and respiration (maintenance costs).&quot; In a very general sense, energy flow (E) can be defined as the sum of metabolic production (P) and respiration (R), such that E=P+R.

Biomass represents stored energy. However, concentration and quality of nutrients and energy is variable. Many plant fibers, for example, are indigestible to many herbivores leaving grazer community food webs more nutrient limited than detrital food webs where bacteria are able to access and release the nutrient and energy stores. &quot;Organisms usually extract energy in the form of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These polymers have a dual role as supplies of energy as well as building blocks; the part that functions as energy supply results in the production of nutrients (and carbon dioxide, water, and heat). Excretion of nutrients is, therefore, basic to metabolism.&quot; The units in energy flow webs are typically a measure mass or energy per m2 per unit time. Different consumers are going to have different metabolic assimilation efficiencies in their diets. Each trophic level transforms energy into biomass. Energy flow diagrams illustrate the rates and efficiency of transfer from one trophic level into another and up through the hierarchy.

It is the case that the biomass of each trophic level decreases from the base of the chain to the top. This is because energy is lost to the environment with each transfer as entropy increases. About eighty to ninety percent of the energy is expended for the organism&#x27;s life processes or is lost as heat or waste. Only about ten to twenty percent of the organism&#x27;s energy is generally passed to the next organism. The amount can be less than one percent in animals consuming less digestible plants, and it can be as high as forty percent in zooplankton consuming phytoplankton. Graphic representations of the biomass or productivity at each tropic level are called ecological pyramids or trophic pyramids. The transfer of energy from primary producers to top consumers can also be characterized by energy flow diagrams.

===Food chain===
A common metric used to quantify food web trophic structure is food chain length. Food chain length is another way of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.

In a simple predator-prey example, a deer is one step removed from the plants it eats (chain length = 1) and a wolf that eats the deer is two steps removed from the plants (chain length = 2). The relative amount or strength of influence that these parameters have on the food web address questions about:
* the identity or existence of a few dominant species (called strong interactors or keystone species)
* the total number of species and food-chain length (including many weak interactors) and
* how community structure, function and stability is determined.

=== Ecological pyramids ===


In a pyramid of numbers, the number of consumers at each level decreases significantly, so that a single top consumer, (e.g., a polar bear or a human), will be supported by a much larger number of separate producers. There is usually a maximum of four or five links in a food chain, although food chains in aquatic ecosystems are more often longer than those on land. Eventually, all the energy in a food chain is dispersed as heat.

Ecological pyramids place the primary producers at the base. They can depict different numerical properties of ecosystems, including numbers of individuals per unit of area, biomass (g/m2), and energy (k cal m−2 yr−1). The emergent pyramidal arrangement of trophic levels with amounts of energy transfer decreasing as species become further removed from the source of production is one of several patterns that is repeated amongst the planets ecosystems. The size of each level in the pyramid generally represents biomass, which can be measured as the dry weight of an organism. Autotrophs may have the highest global proportion of biomass, but they are closely rivaled or surpassed by microbes.

Pyramid structure can vary across ecosystems and across time. In some instances biomass pyramids can be inverted. This pattern is often identified in aquatic and coral reef ecosystems. The pattern of biomass inversion is attributed to different sizes of producers. Aquatic communities are often dominated by producers that are smaller than the consumers that have high growth rates. Aquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of secondary growth as exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years. Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. Energy pyramids, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included and this is dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.

==Material flux and recycling==
Many of the Earth&#x27;s elements and minerals (or mineral nutrients) are contained within the tissues and diets of organisms. Hence, mineral and nutrient cycles trace food web energy pathways. Ecologists employ stoichiometry to analyze the ratios of the main elements found in all organisms: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P). There is a large transitional difference between many terrestrial and aquatic systems as C:P and C:N ratios are much higher in terrestrial systems while N:P ratios are equal between the two systems. Mineral nutrients are the material resources that organisms need for growth, development, and vitality. Food webs depict the pathways of mineral nutrient cycling as they flow through organisms. Most of the primary production in an ecosystem is not consumed, but is recycled by detritus back into useful nutrients. Many of the Earth&#x27;s microorganisms are involved in the formation of minerals in a process called biomineralization. Bacteria that live in detrital sediments create and cycle nutrients and biominerals. Food web models and nutrient cycles have traditionally been treated separately, but there is a strong functional connection between the two in terms of stability, flux, sources, sinks, and recycling of mineral nutrients.

==Kinds of food webs==
Food webs are necessarily aggregated and only illustrate a tiny portion of the complexity of real ecosystems. For example, the number of species on the planet are likely in the general order of 107, over 95% of these species consist of microbes and invertebrates, and relatively few have been named or classified by taxonomists. It is explicitly understood that natural systems are &#x27;sloppy&#x27; and that food web trophic positions simplify the complexity of real systems that sometimes overemphasize many rare interactions. Most studies focus on the larger influences where the bulk of energy transfer occurs. &quot;These omissions and problems are causes for concern, but on present evidence do not present insurmountable difficulties.&quot;

There are different kinds or categories of food webs:
* Source web - one or more node(s), all of their predators, all the food these predators eat, and so on.
* Sink web - one or more node(s), all of their prey, all the food that these prey eat, and so on.
* Community (or connectedness) web - a group of nodes and all the connections of who eats whom.
* Energy flow web - quantified fluxes of energy between nodes along links between a resource and a consumer.
* Paleoecological web - a web that reconstructs ecosystems from the fossil record.
* Functional web - emphasizes the functional significance of certain connections having strong interaction strength and greater bearing on community organization, more so than energy flow pathways. Functional webs have compartments, which are sub-groups in the larger network where there are different densities and strengths of interaction. Functional webs emphasize that &quot;the importance of each population in maintaining the integrity of a community is reflected in its influence on the growth rates of other populations.&quot;

Within these categories, food webs can be further organized according to the different kinds of ecosystems being investigated. For example, human food webs, agricultural food webs, detrital food webs, marine food webs, aquatic food webs, soil food webs, Arctic (or polar) food webs, terrestrial food webs, and microbial food webs. These characterizations stem from the ecosystem concept, which assumes that the phenomena under investigation (interactions and feedback loops) are sufficient to explain patterns within boundaries, such as the edge of a forest, an island, a shoreline, or some other pronounced physical characteristic.

=== Detrital web ===

In a detrital web, plant and animal matter is broken down by decomposers, e.g., bacteria and fungi, and moves to detritivores and then carnivores. There are often relationships between the detrital web and the grazing web. Mushrooms produced by decomposers in the detrital web become a food source for deer, squirrels, and mice in the grazing web. Earthworms eaten by robins are detritivores consuming decaying leaves.

&quot;Detritus can be broadly defined as any form of non-living organic matter, including different types of plant tissue (e.g. leaf litter, dead wood, aquatic macrophytes, algae), animal tissue (carrion), dead microbes, faeces (manure, dung, faecal pellets, guano, frass), as well as products secreted, excreted or exuded from organisms (e.g. extra-cellular polymers, nectar, root exudates and leachates, dissolved organic matter, extra-cellular matrix, mucilage). The relative importance of these forms of detritus, in terms of origin, size and chemical composition, varies across ecosystems.&quot;

==Quantitative food webs==
Ecologists collect data on trophic levels and food webs to statistically model and mathematically calculate parameters, such as those used in other kinds of network analysis (e.g., graph theory), to study emergent patterns and properties shared among ecosystems. There are different ecological dimensions that can be mapped to create more complicated food webs, including: species composition (type of species), richness (number of species), biomass (the dry weight of plants and animals), productivity (rates of conversion of energy and nutrients into growth), and stability (food webs over time). A food web diagram illustrating species composition shows how change in a single species can directly and indirectly influence many others. are used to simplify food web research into semi-isolated units such as small springs, decaying logs, and laboratory experiments using organisms that reproduce quickly, such as daphnia feeding on algae grown under controlled environments in jars of water.

While the complexity of real food webs connections are difficult to decipher, ecologists have found mathematical models on networks an invaluable tool for gaining insight into the structure, stability, and laws of food web behaviours relative to observable outcomes. &quot;Food web theory centers around the idea of connectance.&quot; Quantitative formulas simplify the complexity of food web structure. The number of trophic links (tL), for example, is converted into a connectance value:

:formula_1,

where, S(S-1)/2 is the maximum number of binary connections among S species. &quot;Connectance (C) is the fraction of all possible links that are realized (L/S2) and represents a standard measure of food web complexity...&quot; The distance (d) between every species pair in a web is averaged to compute the mean distance between all nodes in a web (D) and multiplied by the total number of links (L) to obtain link-density (LD), which is influenced by scale-dependent variables such as species richness. These formulas are the basis for comparing and investigating the nature of non-random patterns in the structure of food web networks among many different types of ecosystems.

Scaling laws, complexity, chaos, and pattern correlates are common features attributed to food web structure.

=== Complexity and stability ===

Food webs are extremely complex. Complexity is a term that conveys the mental intractability of understanding all possible higher-order effects in a food web. Sometimes in food web terminology, complexity is defined as product of the number of species and connectance., though there have been criticisms of this definition and other proposed methods for measuring network complexity. Connectance is &quot;the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network&quot;. These concepts were derived and stimulated through the suggestion that complexity leads to stability in food webs, such as increasing the number of trophic levels in more species rich ecosystems. This hypothesis was challenged through mathematical models suggesting otherwise, but subsequent studies have shown that the premise holds in real systems.

At different levels in the hierarchy of life, such as the stability of a food web, &quot;the same overall structure is maintained in spite of an ongoing flow and change of components.&quot; The farther a living system (e.g., ecosystem) sways from equilibrium, the greater its complexity. Complexity has multiple meanings in the life sciences and in the public sphere that confuse its application as a precise term for analytical purposes in science. Complexity in the life sciences (or biocomplexity) is defined by the &quot;properties emerging from the interplay of behavioral, biological, physical, and social interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living organisms, including humans&quot;.

Several concepts have emerged from the study of complexity in food webs. Complexity explains many principals pertaining to self-organization, non-linearity, interaction, cybernetic feedback, discontinuity, emergence, and stability in food webs. Nestedness, for example, is defined as &quot;a pattern of interaction in which specialists interact with species that form perfect subsets of the species with which generalists interact&quot;, &quot;—that is, the diet of the most specialized species is a subset of the diet of the next more generalized species, and its diet a subset of the next more generalized, and so on.&quot; Until recently, it was thought that food webs had little nested structure, but empirical evidence shows that many published webs have nested subwebs in their assembly.

Food webs are complex networks. As networks, they exhibit similar structural properties and mathematical laws that have been used to describe other complex systems, such as small world and scale free properties. The small world attribute refers to the many loosely connected nodes, non-random dense clustering of a few nodes (i.e., trophic or keystone species in ecology), and small path length compared to a regular lattice. &quot;Ecological networks, especially mutualistic networks, are generally very heterogeneous, consisting of areas with sparse links among species and distinct areas of tightly linked species. These regions of high link density are often referred to as cliques, hubs, compartments, cohesive sub-groups, or modules...Within food webs, especially in aquatic systems, nestedness appears to be related to body size because the diets of smaller predators tend to be nested subsets of those of larger predators (Woodward &amp; Warren 2007; YvonDurocher et al. 2008), and phylogenetic constraints, whereby related taxa are nested based on their common evolutionary history, are also evident (Cattin et al. 2004).&quot; &quot;Compartments in food webs are subgroups of taxa in which many strong interactions occur within the subgroups and few weak interactions occur between the subgroups. Theoretically, compartments increase the stability in networks, such as food webs.&quot;

Food webs are also complex in the way that they change in scale, seasonally, and geographically. The components of food webs, including organisms and mineral nutrients, cross the thresholds of ecosystem boundaries. This has led to the concept or area of study known as cross-boundary subsidy. &quot;This leads to anomalies, such as food web calculations determining that an ecosystem can support one half of a top carnivore, without specifying which end.&quot; Nonetheless, real differences in structure and function have been identified when comparing different kinds of ecological food webs, such as terrestrial vs. aquatic food webs.

== History of food webs ==
Food webs serve as a framework to help ecologists organize the complex network of interactions among species observed in nature and around the world. One of the earliest descriptions of a food chain was described by a medieval Afro-Arab scholar named Al-Jahiz: &quot;All animals, in short, cannot exist without food, neither can the hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn.&quot; The earliest graphical depiction of a food web was by Lorenzo Camerano in 1880, followed independently by those of Pierce and colleagues in 1912 and Victor Shelford in 1913. Two food webs about herring were produced by Victor Summerhayes and Charles Elton and Alister Hardy in 1923 and 1924. Charles Elton subsequently pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book &quot;Animal Ecology&quot;; Elton&#x27;s &#x27;food cycle&#x27; was replaced by &#x27;food web&#x27; in a subsequent ecological text. After Charles Elton&#x27;s use of food webs in his 1927 synthesis, they became a central concept in the field of ecology. Elton organized species into functional groups, which formed the basis for the trophic system of classification in Raymond Lindeman&#x27;s classic and landmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics. The notion of a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin and his terminology, including an &quot;entangled bank&quot;, &quot;web of life&quot;, &quot;web of complex relations&quot;, and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he talked about &quot;the continued movement of the particles of earth&quot;. Even earlier, in 1768 John Bruckner described nature as &quot;one continued web of life&quot;.

Interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine&#x27;s experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May and Stuart Pimm, were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs.

<text>A buoy (; ) is a floating device that can have many purposes. It can be anchored (stationary) or allowed to drift with ocean currents.

==History==

The ultimate origin of buoys is unknown, but by 1295 a seaman&#x27;s manual referred to navigation buoys in the Guadalquivir River in Spain. To the north there are early medieval mentions of the French / Belgian River Maas being buoyed. Such early buoys were probably just timber beams or rafts, but in 1358 there is a record of a barrel buoy in the Dutch Maasmond (also known as the Maas Sluis or Maasgat). The simple barrel was difficult to secure to the seabed, and so a conical &quot;tonne&quot; was developed. They had a solid plug at the narrow end through which a mooring ring could be attached. By 1790 the older conical tonne was being replaced by a &quot;nun&quot; buoy. This had the same conical section below the waterline as the tonne buoy, but at the waterline a barrel shape was used to allow a truncated cone to be above the water. The whole was completed with a top mark. In the nineteenth century iron buoys became available. They had watertight internal bulkheads and as well as topmarks and might have bells (1860) or whistles (1880). In 1879 Julius Pintsch obtained a patent for the illumination of buoys by using a compressed gas. This was superseded from 1912 onwards by Gustaf Dalén&#x27;s acetylene lamp. This could be set to flash which ensured that buoys could be distinguished from ships&#x27; lights and from each other. A later development was the sun valve which shut off the gas during sunlight.

==Types==

===Navigational buoys===
* Race course marker buoys are used for buoy racing, the most prevalent form of yacht racing and power boat racing. They delimit the course and must be passed to a specified side. They are also used in underwater orienteering competitions.
* Emergency wreck buoys provide a clear and unambiguous means of temporarily marking new wrecks, typically for the first 24–72 hours. They are coloured in an equal number of blue and yellow vertical stripes and fitted with an alternating blue and yellow flashing light. They were implemented following collisions in the Dover Strait in 2002 when vessels struck the new wreck of the .
* Ice marking buoys mark holes in frozen lakes and rivers so snowmobiles do not drive over the holes.
* Large Navigational Buoys (LNB, or Lanby buoys) are automatic buoys over 10 meters high equipped with a powerful light monitored electronically as a replacement for a lightvessel. They may be marked on charts as a &quot;Superbuoy.&quot;
* Lateral marker buoys
* Safe water mark or fairway buoys mark the entrance to a channel or nearby landfall
* Sea marks aid pilotage by marking a maritime channel, hazard or administrative area to allow boats and ships to navigate safely. Some are fitted with wave-activated bells or gongs.
* Wreck buoys mark a wrecked ship to warn other ships to keep away because of unseen hazards.
* provide demarcation at night.

=== Marker buoys ===
Buoys are often used to temporarily or permanently mark the positions of underwater objects:
* Lobster trap buoys are brightly colored buoys marking lobster trap locations so lobster fishers can find their lobster traps. Each fisher has a unique colour marking or registration number. They are allowed to haul only their own traps, and must display their buoy colour or license number on their boat so law enforcement officials know what they should be hauling. The buoys are brightly coloured with highly visible numbers so they can be seen in poor visibility conditions like rain, fog and sea smoke.
* Fishing floats are a type of lightweight buoys used in angling to mark the position of the baited hook suspended underneath, and as a bite indicator to signal the angler any changes in the hook&#x27;s underwater status.

==== Diving ====
Several types of marker buoys may be used by divers:
* Decompression buoys are deployed by submerged SCUBA divers to mark their position underwater whilst doing decompression stops
* Shot buoys mark dive sites for the boat safety cover of scuba divers so they can descend to dive sites more easily in conditions of low visibility or tidal currents and more safely do decompression stops on their ascents.
* Surface marker buoys are taken on dives by scuba divers to mark their positions underwater.
* Dive site demarcation buoys indicate that divers are working in the marked area, to warn passing vessels to stay clear.

=== Rescue ===
* Lifebuoys are lifesaving buoys thrown to people in the water to provide buoyancy. They usually have a connected line allowing them to be pulled in.
* Self-locating datum marker buoys (SLDMB) are 70% scale Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (CODE)/Davis-style oceanographic surface drifters with drogue vanes between 30 and 100 cm deep, designed for deployment from U.S. Coast Guard vessels or airframes for search and rescue. They have very little surface area above water to minimize the effects on them off winds and waves.
* Submarine rescue buoys are released in emergencies and for communication purposes.

=== Research ===
* Profiling buoys are specialized buoys that adjust their buoyancy to sink at a controlled rate to a set depth, for example 2,000 metres while measuring sea temperature and salinity. After a certain period, typically 10 days, they return to the surface, transmit their data via satellite, then sink again. See Argo (oceanography).
* Tsunami buoys are anchored buoys that can detect sudden changes in undersea water pressure, and are a component of tsunami warning systems in the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Indian Oceans.
* Wave buoys measure the movement of the water surface as a wave train. The data they transmit is analysed to form statistics like significant wave height and period, and wave direction.
* Weather buoys measure weather parameters such as air temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed and direction. They transmit this data, via satellite radio links such as the purpose-built Argos System or commercial satellite phone networks, to meteorological centres for forecasting and climate study. They may be anchored (moored buoys), or allowed to drift (drifting buoys) in the open currents. Their position is calculated by the satellite. They are also referred to as Ocean Data Acquisition Systems, or (ODAS) buoys. and may be marked on charts as &quot;Superbuoys.&quot;

=== Mooring ===
* Mooring buoys keep one end of a mooring cable or chain on the water&#x27;s surface so ships and boats can tie to them. Many marinas mark them with numbers and assign them to particular vessels, or rent them to transient vessels.
* Tripping buoys are used to keep one end of a &quot; to be used to break out and lift an anchor on the water&#x27;s surface so that a stuck anchor can more easily be freed.

=== Military ===
* Marker buoys, used in naval warfare (particularly anti-submarine warfare) emit light and/or smoke using pyrotechnic devices to create the flare and smoke. Commonly 3 inches (76 mm) in diameter and about 20 inches (500 mm) long, they are activated by contact with seawater and float on the surface. Some extinguish themselves after a specific period, while others are sunk when they are no longer needed.
* Sonobuoys are used by anti-submarine warfare aircraft to detect submarines by SONAR.
* Target buoys simulate targets, such as small boats, in live-fire exercises by naval and coastal forces. They are usually targeted by medium-sized weapons such as heavy machine guns, rapid fire cannons (~20 mm), autocannons (up to 40–57 mm) and anti-tank rockets.

===Specific forms===
* DAN buoys are used as:
** Large maritime navigational aids providing a platform for light and radio beacons
** Lifebuoys with flags, used on yachts and smaller pleasure craft
** Temporary markers in Danish seine fishing to mark net anchor positions
** Temporary markers set by danlayers during minesweeping operations to indicate the boundaries of swept paths, swept areas, known hazards, and other locations or reference points
** Temporary markers for rescue operations
* Spar buoys are tall, thin buoys that float upright, e.g. R/P FLIP

===Other===

* Letter boxes on buoys exist in Töre (Sweden) and at the Steinhuder Meer (Germany)

===Fictional===
* Imaginary &quot;Mail buoys&quot; have been used as a prank in the US Navy when a new sailor may be given the task of locating one to retrieve non-existent mail.
* Space buoys, a feature in some science fiction stories which are stationary objects in outer space that provide navigation data or warnings.

==Other uses==
* The word &quot;buoyed&quot; can also be used figuratively. For example, a person can buoy up (&#x27;lift up&#x27;) someone&#x27;s spirits by providing help and empathy.
* Buoys are used in some wave power systems to generate electrical power.
* George A. Stephen, founder of Weber-Stephen Products Co., invented the kettle grill by cutting a metal buoy in half and fashioning a dome shaped grill to it with a rounded lid.

<doc id="145776" wikidata="Q6546591" url="?curid=145776" title="Lightvessel stations of Great Britain">
<text>The history of the many lightvessel stations of Great Britain goes back over 250 years to the placement of the world&#x27;s first lightship at the Nore in the early 18th century.

A lightvessel station is a named position at which a lightvessel was placed, rather than a particular ship; individual vessels were often transferred between different stations during their existence. Stations themselves were occasionally changed, especially during wartime, when lights were only displayed in response to specific shipping needs. 

==History==

The world&#x27;s first lightvessel was the result of a business partnership between Robert Hamblin, a former barber and ship manager from King&#x27;s Lynn, and David Avery, an investor. In 1730 the pair secured a government licence to moor a ship, with a prominent light affixed to it, to serve as a navigation aid at the Nore in the Thames mouth. Hamblin and Avery intended to profit from the vessel by collecting a fee from passing merchant vessels. The licence was opposed by Trinity House, which considered that it possessed a monopoly on construction and maintenance of navigation aids in British waters. After extensive legal dispute the licence was revoked in 1732 and Trinity House assumed direct responsibility for the proposed lightship; Hamblin and Avery were granted nominal lease revenues in exchange. The Nore lightship commenced operations in 1734.

A second lightvessel was placed at the Dudgeon station, off the Norfolk coast, in 1736, with others following at Owers Bank (1788) and the Goodwin Sands (1793). While the Admiralty opposed the 1802 Sunk lightvessel, claiming it would aid enemy ships, it soon afterwards placed three vessels of its own to protect the fleet during the Napoleonic Wars; they were taken over by Trinity House a few years later. Many others were commissioned during the nineteenth century, especially off England&#x27;s east coast and the approaches to the Thames, where there were many treacherous shoals.

Following their acquisition of the Admiralty ships, all English and Welsh lightvessels were maintained by Trinity House, with the exception of the four vessels in the approaches to the River Mersey, which were maintained by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board until 1973, and those in the Humber Estuary, which were the responsibility of the Humber Conservancy Board. 

===Communications and safety===

Communication with lightvessels proved to be a major problem for Trinity House; lightvessel crews were well-placed to observe ships in distress, but could not always alert lifeboats on shore. After a series of shipwrecks, an experiment was conducted whereby a nine-mile undersea cable was run from the Sunk lightvessel in the Thames Estuary to the post office at Walton-on-the-Naze. This was intended to commence in 1884, but was plagued by delays; the trial was unsuccessful as the cable repeatedly broke. 

As a result of a motion brought forward by Sir Edward Birkbeck, a Royal Commission was established to look at the issue of &#x27;electrical communication&#x27; and gave its first Report in 1892; the East Goodwin lightvessel was used during one of Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s early experiments in radio transmission in 1896. The world&#x27;s first radio distress signal was transmitted by the East Goodwin lightvessel&#x27;s radio operator on 17 March 1899, after the merchant vessel &quot;Elbe&quot; ran aground on the Goodwins, while on 30 April that year, the East Goodwin vessel transmitted a distress signal on its own behalf, when the SS &quot;R. F. Matthews&quot; rammed it in a dense fog. Safety was further improved by the development of more powerful lamps and through the replacement by foghorns of the gongs previously used as fog signals.

===Crew===

Until the second half of the 20th century, all Trinity House vessels were permanently manned. An 1861 article in the Cornhill Magazine described lightshipmen as being paid 55 shillings a month (in addition to drawing 1 shilling and sixpence a week &quot;in lieu of 3 gallons of small-beer&quot;): the vessels were supplied, and the crews relieved, once a month. It was also noted that &quot;a general tone of decent, orderly and superior conduct&quot; was observed, that the men were &quot;very respectable [...] swearing and profane language are [...] prohibited&quot; and that every man was supplied with a Bible as well as &quot;a library of varied and entertaining literature&quot;.

By the start of the 20th century, Trinity House lightvessels had a crew of 11, of whom seven (a master and six ratings) would be on active duty at any one time. It was an extremely demanding and dangerous profession, and it would take 15 to 20 years of service to be promoted to master.

===Replacement===

The majority of British lightvessels were decommissioned during the 1970s - 1980s and replaced with light floats or LANBY buoys, which were vastly cheaper to maintain: in 1974 at the time of Trinity House&#x27;s original development project, lightship annual running costs at £30,000 were ten times those of the LANBY.

The remaining UK lightvessels have now been converted to unmanned operation and most now use solar power.

==Vessels==
Unlike lightships in the United States and other parts of the world, Trinity House lightvessels were usually unpowered and needed to be towed to or from their position. In order to act as effective daymarks they were painted red, with the station name in large white letters on the side of the hull, and a system of balls and cones at the masthead for identification. The first revolving light was fitted to the Swin Middle lightvessel in 1837: others used occulting or flashing lights. White lights were preferred for visibility though red and very occasionally green (as with the Mouse lightvessel) were also used.

It is likely that photographs on various websites showing named lightvessels, may appear to be structurally different to comparable records on other web pages due to the fact that the particular vessel might have been withdrawn from a station after photographing and being towed away for drydocking, overhaul and possible direction to a new station and therefore a different lightvessel would have been substituted at the named station on withdrawal of the previous lightvessel. This has been most evident on those vessels that have been withdrawn and shipped to another port at home or abroad to become a floating museum, floating restaurant, &#x27;clubhouse&#x27;, etc. Scarweather LV and Helwick LV have for instance changed their rôle in their lifetime and their appearance on various records varies considerably.

==England==

===Active stations===

The following are active stations at which Trinity House still maintains unmanned lightships, which also act as weather stations.
===Former stations===

==Scotland, Isle of Man==

Lightvessels in Scotland and the Isle of Man were maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board, with the exception of those maintained by the Clyde Lighthouse Trust and by the Dundee Port Trustees. Of the NLB vessels, only the North Carr was crewed.


==Wales==
Former Welsh lightships were maintained by Trinity House. Remaining substitute navigational aids still are.

*Helwick (off Worms Head)
*Milford Haven Lightvessel
*Scarweather (Swansea Bay; replaced with buoy 1989)
*St Gowan (off Pembrokeshire coast). The station once carried the name St Govan, i.e., spelling change

<text>The Munchkin is a breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by a genetic mutation. Compared to many other cat breeds, it is a relatively new breed, documented since 1940s and officially recognized in 1991. The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.

Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1997 with critics voicing concerns over potential health and mobility issues. Many pedigree cat associations around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and uncertainty of the health issues, including the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Breeding of Munchkin cats is prohibited by law in several countries due to these genetic health concerns.

The name derives from writer L. Frank Baum&#x27;s diminutive inhabitants of Munchkin Country, originating in the 1900 novel, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==History==
===Breed creation===
Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.

In 1983, Sandra Hochenedel, a music teacher in Rayville, Louisiana, found two pregnant cats who had been chased under a truck by a dog. She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born short-legged. Hochenedel gave a short-legged male kitten from one of Blackberry&#x27;s litters to a friend, Kay LaFrance of Monroe, Louisiana, and she named the kitten Toulouse. It is from Blackberry and Toulouse&#x27;s litter that today&#x27;s Munchkin breed is descended.

=== Registry history ===
The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by The International Cat Association (TICA) in Davis, Oklahoma. However, the breed would not be officially recognized at that time. Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some dachshunds. For many years, the Munchkin breed was not accepted in feline competitions due to the controversial breeding. Solveig Pflueger, a show judge, geneticist, and chairperson of TICA&#x27;s Genetics Committee was a strong advocate for the official recognition of the breed. Pflueger was also a breeder of Munchkin cats herself, having been initially sent two cats from Hochenedel. Amidst much controversy, the Munchkin was proposed as a new breed by foundation breeders Laurie Bobskill and Robert Bobskill of Massachusetts and accepted by TICA into its new breed development program in September 1994. Veteran show judge Katherine Crawford resigned in protest, calling the breed an affront to breeders with ethics. The Munchkin breed achieved TICA championship status in May 2003.

Currently, the only registries that fully recognize the breed are TICA, the Southern Africa Cat Council, the Australian Cat Federation, the World Cat Federation, and Catz Incorporated (New Zealand). There is controversy among breeders of pedigree cats as to what genetic mutations are abnormal and potentially disadvantageous to the cat. Katie Lisnik, director of cat protection and policy at the Humane Society of the United States, has said: &quot;Breeding animals for exaggerated physical characteristics, particularly when it compromises overall health, is irresponsible&quot;. Several cat registries do not recognize the Munchkin: Fédération Internationale Féline, which refuses to recognize what they consider a breed based on a &quot;genetic disease&quot;, achondroplasia. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy likewise refuses to recognize the breed, considering this breed and others like it to be &quot;unacceptable&quot; because they are based on an &quot;abnormal structure or development&quot;. The breed is also not recognized by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association.

== Welfare concern ==
===Breeding bans===
Several countries and territories have prohibited breeding with Munchkins, including the Netherlands (2014), which prohibits breeding of all animals with genetic defects, and Victoria (Australia). The Australian Capital Territory (a territory of Australia) government considers the Munchkin breed to be &quot;malformed animals&quot; and the deliberate breeding of them &quot;unacceptable&quot; because of the &quot;genetic health problems associated with such breeding&quot;.

Munchkin cross-breeds like the bambino have also been subject to legal restrictions.

==Characteristics==

Some sources state that the shortness of their legs does not interfere with their running and leaping abilities, while others state their ability to jump is limited by their condition.

The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as outcrosses. It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate body type and medium-plush coat. Male Munchkins typically weigh between and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically weigh between . The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a slight rise from the shoulder to the rump. The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly bowed, although excessive bowing is a disqualification in the show ring. Cow-hocked legs are also penalized.

The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns. It also comes in a long-haired variety, which is shown in a separate Munchkin Longhair category. The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the long-haired has a semi-long silky coat. TICA rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat that does not already belong to a recognized breed. Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification. Non-standard Munchkins are not allowed to be shown.

In 2014, Lilieput, a Munchkin cat from Napa, California, was named the shortest statured living cat in the world by Guinness World Records. She stands tall.

==Health==
The mutation that causes the shortened legs in the Munchkin is a chondrodysplasia. The Munchkin cat has an increased incidence of lordosis and pectus excavatum (hollowed chest).

Munchkin cats are known to be at a higher risk (than other feline breeds) for severe osteoarthritis because the shorter limbs affect their activity levels and behavior. Diagnosis of osteoarthritis and the assessment of its severity for a cat may require radiography.

Many pedigree cat associations around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to health concerns.

==Genetics==
The gene causing chondrodysplasia in the Munchkin cat is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation. Only heterozygous cats are viable.

Punnett squares, in which the M represents the dominant Munchkin gene and the m represents the recessive normal gene, may be used to illustrate the chances of a particular mating resulting in a short-legged cat.

For each kitten conceived from this mating, there is a 25% chance it will fail to gestate, a 25% chance it will be normal, and a 50% chance it will be short-legged.

For each kitten conceived from this mating, there is a 0% chance it will be homozygous for the Munchkin gene, a 50% chance it will be normal non-standard (long legged) Munchkin, and a 50% chance it will be a standard (short legged) Munchkin.

==Derived breeds==
The popularity of the Munchkin has led to the crossbreeding of the Munchkin with other breeds, to try to establish new, derived breeds, most of which are unrecognised by any major registry. Some named experimental crossbreeds (all of them dwarf cats) include:

* Bambino, a mostly-hairless dwarf cat, from a cross of the Munchkin and the Sphynx breeds. Recognised by the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry (REFR). In 2019, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority ordered a couple to stop breeding the Bambino due to welfare concerns.
* Dwelf, a cross between the Munchkin, Sphynx, and American Curl, with the defining traits of all three breeds: shortened legs, hairlessness, and curled ears. It is recognised by REFR.
* Genetta, a cross between Munchkin, Bengal, and sometimes Ocicat breeds, with a spotted, striped, or marbled coat. It is recognised by REFR.
* Kinkalow, a cross between Munchkin and American Curl, with short legs and curled ears. It is recognised by REFR.
* Lambkin (or Nanus Rex), a cross between Munchkin and Selkirk Rex, with short legs and a curly coat. It is recognised by the REFR.
* Minskin, a breed developed from Munchkin, Burmese, Sphynx, and Devon Rex stock, with short legs, hairlessness or a very short coat, and point coloration. It is recognised by REFR, and preliminaily by The International Cat Association (TICA) since 2018.
* Minuet (or Napoleon), a cross between Munchkin and Persian (or sometimes Himalayan or Exotic Shorthair), with short legs and brachycephaly (&quot;peke-face&quot;, characteristic of the latter breeds). Coat length and coloration depend on the bloodline. It is a fully recognized breed by TICA (experimentally since 2001). It is still recognized under the Napoleon name by REFR.
* Skookum (or LaMerm), a cross between Munchkin and LaPerm, with the short legs of the former and curly coat of the latter. It is recognised by the REFR.

<doc id="145785" wikidata="Q42685" url="?curid=145785" title="Ocicat">
<text>The Ocicat is an all-domestic breed of cat which resembles a wild cat but has no recent wild DNA in its gene pool. It is named for its resemblance to the ocelot. The breed was established from the Siamese and Abyssinian and later on American Shorthair would be added.

==History==
===Origin===
The Ocicat was created spontaneously by Virginia Daly of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. Daly bred a ruddy Abyssinian male named Dalai Deta Tim of Selene to a female seal point Siamese named Dalai Tomboy Patter. The first generation of kittens appeared Abyssinian and a female named Dalai She was kept. Dalai She was later bred to a chocolate point Siamese named Whitehead Elegante Sun. The resulting litter had the desired Abyssinian point Siamese type cats. She continued breeding them but this time one of the kittens was an ivory cat with golden spots. Virginia&#x27;s daughter said he looked like an ocelot and wished to name him &#x27;ocicat&#x27;, instead he was named Tonga and was sold off to a medical student for $10 with an agreement to neuter him. Virginia read an article by Dr. Clyde Keeler of Georgia State College for Women that described the extinct egyptian spotted fishing cat. Realising Tonga looked similar to the cat she wrote to him about the cat. He replied and suggested that she breed Tonga back with his mother. Given that Tonga couldn&#x27;t be used she bred his parents together again and this produced a tawny-spotted male named Dalai Dotson. The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) made an error when registering the breed and listed it as a mix between the Abyssinian and American Shorthair. This led to the current breed standard where American Shorthair is acceptable and added in more colour variation to the Ocicat. The Ocicat would first be brought to the United Kingdom in 1988 when two cats: Catoninetail Mr Smith and Catoninetail Miss Jones were imported from the United States. Four more would be imported a year later. A total of 33 cats would be imported before 2015. Other breeders joined in and used the same recipe, Siamese to Abyssinian, and offspring to Siamese. 

===Breed recognition===
In 1966 the breed was recognised with the CFA for registration only. It was more than 20 years later in May 1987 that the Ocicat achieved championship status with the CFA. The International Cat Association (TICA) recognised the Ocicat in 1986. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy gave preliminary recognition in June 1997. In June 2002 it promoted the Ocicat to provisional status. Championship status followed in 2006.

==Appearance==

The Ocicat is a medium to large cat with agouti markings. It has the appearance of an athletic animal: well-muscled and lithe. The muzzle is broad and well defined with gentle curvature of the head. Ears are set around a 45-degree angle. The eyes are large and almond shaped with good spacing so there is more than an eye-width gap between the two. All eye colours are accepted bar blue. Legs are of medium to long length and well muscled with a good proportion to the body. The tail is long, slim with a slight taper and has a dark tip. Adult Ocicats weigh between 6-14 lbs (2.7-6.4 kg)

===Coat===
The colour should be darkest at the tip of the tail with the rest of the markings being lighter than the tip.

====Coat pattern====

Only the spotted tabby markings are permissible. There is a recognizable tabby &#x27;M&#x27; pattern on the forehead. The markings extend all the way to the back of the neck from the forehead. Markings that resemble mascara are found around the eyes and cheeks. There are spots all throughout the body.

====Coat colour====
There are 12 recognised colours for the Ocicat: Tawny (black), chocolate, cinnamon, blue (dilute of black), lilac (dilute of chocolate), fawn (dilute of cinnamon), black silver, chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lilac silver, and fawn silver.

==Health==
In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the US the Ocicat had a much higher incidence rate than most other breeds with an odds ratio of 16.8. A Swedish study of pyometra in cats based on veterinary and insurance data found the Ocicat to have the third highest incidence of the condition with it being six times the rate for all cats.

==Aztec==
In 2013 the GCCF recognised the Aztec as a separate breed. The Aztec is a mackerel tabby coated version of the Ocicat that would often occur in litters but not meet the standard of the Ocicat as it called for spotted cats only. Aside from the coat it is otherwise identical to the Ocicat. As of 2024 the Aztec has been merged back with the Ocicat and is now the Ocicat Classic, a variant of the Ocicat.

==Temperament==
Their temperament is often described as that of a &quot;dog in a cat&#x27;s body&quot;. Most can be trained to fetch, walk on a leash and harness, come when called, speak, sit, lie down on command and other canine-style tricks.

<text>This is a list of lighthouses in Scotland. The Northern Lighthouse Board, from which much of the information is derived, are responsible for most lighthouses in Scotland but have handed over responsibility in the major estuaries to the port authorities. Many of the more minor lights are not shown. A lighthouse that is no longer operating is indicated by the date of closure in the &quot;operated by&quot; column. Where two dates are shown, the lighthouse has been rebuilt.

Nearly all the lighthouses in this list were designed by and most were built by four generations of one family, including Thomas Smith, who was both the stepfather and father-in-law of Robert Stevenson. Robert&#x27;s sons and grandsons not only built most of the lights, often under the most appalling of conditions, but pioneered many of the improvements in lighting and signalling that cut down the enormous loss of life in shipping around the coasts of Scotland.

The table may be sorted by any column by clicking on the heading.

<text>Corsewall Lighthouse is a lighthouse at Corsewall Point, Kirkcolm near Stranraer in the region of Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland. First lit in 1817, it overlooks the North Channel of the Irish Sea. 

Corsewall is defined as the place or well of the Cross.

==History==
In 1814, a Mr Kirkman Finley applied to the Trade of Clyde for a lighthouse on Corsewall Point. The Northern Lighthouse Board investigated the site and in 1815 decided that a lighthouse should be built at the entrance of Loch Ryan, Galloway. When the engineer and lighthouse designer Robert Stevenson undertook an inspection voyage in December 1815, he observed that the lighthouse tower, at , and house were under construction.

Corsewall Lighthouse was first lit in 1817. That same year, the Principal Keeper was reported for incompetence after falling asleep while on duty. For a period of time the revolving apparatus of the light had stopped. The Keeper was suspended and demoted becoming an assistant at Bell Rock Lighthouse. He never again chiefly monitored a lighthouse.

In November 1970, Concorde reportedly flew over the lighthouse on a trial flight and shattered panes of glass on the lighthouse. Later flights did not affect it.

In 1994, the light was automated and monitored from the Northern Lighthouse Board in Edinburgh. The lighthouse keepers accommodation has been converted into the Corsewall Lighthouse Hotel.

In 1892, three engineers who were installing a new light hid a message in a bottle at the lighthouse. The bottle and message were discovered in 2024 while the lighthouse was undergoing refurbishment.

<doc id="145792" wikidata="Q43743" url="?curid=145792" title="Continental Divide of the Americas">
<text>The Continental Divide of the Americas (also known as the Great Divide, the Western Divide or simply the Continental Divide; ) is the principal, and largely mountainous, hydrological divide of the Americas. The Continental Divide extends from the Bering Strait to the Strait of Magellan, and separates the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean from those river systems that drain into the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean, including those that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and Hudson Bay.

Although there are many other hydrological divides in the Americas, the Continental Divide is by far the most prominent of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, at a generally much higher elevation than the other hydrological divisions.

==Geography==


Beginning at the westernmost point of the Americas, Cape Prince of Wales, just south of the Arctic Circle, the Continental Divide&#x27;s geographic path runs through Arctic Alaska, where it reaches its more northerly point close to the U.S.-Canada border near the Beaufort Sea. The Divide zig-zags southwardly over Yukon, and forms part of the boundary between Yukon and the Northwest Territories in the Mackenzie Mountains. 
It then proceeds through the Northern British Columbia Interior via the Cassiar Mountains, Omineca Mountains and northern Nechako Plateau to Summit Lake, north of the city of Prince George and just south of the community of McLeod Lake. From there the Divide traverses the McGregor Plateau to the spine of the Rockies, following the crest of the Canadian Rockies southeast to the 120th meridian west, from there forming the boundary between southern British Columbia and southern Alberta.

The Divide crosses into the United States in northwestern Montana, at the boundary between Waterton Lakes National Park and Glacier National Park. In Canada, it forms the western boundary of Waterton Lakes National Park, and in the US bisects Glacier National Park. Further south, the Divide forms the backbone of the Rocky Mountain Front (Front Range) in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, heads south towards Helena and Butte, then west past the namesake community of Divide, Montana, through the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness to the Bitterroot Range, where it forms the eastern third of the state boundary between Idaho and Montana. The Divide crosses into Wyoming within Yellowstone National Park and continues southeast around the Great Divide Basin, through the Sierra Madre Range into Colorado where it reaches its highest point in North America at the summit of Grays Peak at . It crosses US Hwy 160 in southwestern Colorado at Wolf Creek Pass, where a line symbolizes the division. The Divide then proceeds south into western New Mexico, passing along the western boundary of the endorheic Plains of San Agustin. Although the Divide represents the height of land between watersheds, it does not always follow the highest ranges/peaks within each state or province.

In Mexico, it passes through Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Querétaro, México, the Federal District, Morelos, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. In Central America, it continues through southern Guatemala, southwestern Honduras, western Nicaragua, western/southwestern Costa Rica, and southern Panama. The divide reaches its lowest natural point in Central America at the Isthmus of Rivas at in Nicaragua. In Panama, the Canal cuts through it at .

The Divide continues into South America, where it follows the peaks of the Andes Mountains, traversing western Colombia, central Ecuador, western and southwestern Peru, and eastern Chile (essentially conforming to the Chile-Bolivia and Chile-Argentina boundaries), southward to Cabo San Diego at the southern end of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The Divide passes through the Punta Cancanan Pass in Peru at .

=== Additional divides ===
The Arctic Divide or Northern Divide in northern and western Canada separates the Arctic Ocean watershed from the Hudson Bay watershed. Another, mainly non-mountainous, divide, the Laurentian Divide (also sometimes called the Northern Divide), further separates the Hudson Bay-Arctic Ocean drainage region from the Atlantic watershed region. Secondary divides separate the watersheds that flow into the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River (ultimately into the Atlantic) from watersheds that flow to the Gulf of Mexico (also part of the Atlantic Ocean) via the Missouri-Mississippi-Ohio river system. Another secondary divide follows the Appalachian chain, which separates those streams and rivers that flow directly into the Atlantic Ocean from those that exit via the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.

===Triple points===
Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park, Montana, is the point where two of the principal continental divides in North America converge, the primary Continental Divide and the Northern or Laurentian Divide. From this point, waters flow to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Ocean via Hudson Bay. Most geographers, geologists, meteorologists, and oceanographers consider this point the hydrological apex of North America, as Hudson Bay is generally considered part of the Arctic Ocean. For example, the International Hydrographic Organization (in its current unapproved working edition only of &quot;Limits of Oceans and Seas&quot;) defines the Hudson Bay, with its outlet extending from 62.5 to 66.5 degrees north (just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle) as being part of the Arctic Ocean, specifically &quot;Arctic Ocean Subdivision 9.11.&quot;

This hydrological apex of North America status of Triple Divide Peak is the main reason behind the designation of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park as the &quot;Crown of the Continent&quot; of North America. The summit of the peak is the world&#x27;s only oceanic triple divide point. Discounting Antarctica and its ice sheets, only one other continent (Asia) borders three oceans, but the inward-draining Endorheic basin area of Central Asia from western China to the Aral and Caspian Seas is so vast that any Arctic and Indian Ocean tributaries are never within proximity of each other. Thus, North America&#x27;s status of having a single location draining into three oceans is unique in the world.

Sources differ, however, on whether Hudson Bay, entirely south of the Arctic Circle, is part of the Atlantic or Arctic Ocean. Hudson Bay&#x27;s water budget connects to the Atlantic more than to the Arctic Ocean. The channels to the north of Hudson Bay are largely cut off by Baffin Island from the Arctic, so much of the water that enters it mixes with the Atlantic to the east via Hudson Strait rather than north into the Arctic. The result is that most of the ice flowing down the Saskatchewan Glacier eventually ends up as water in the Atlantic Ocean.

If Hudson Bay is considered part of the Atlantic, then the &quot;triple point&quot; is at an unimportant-looking, permanently snow and ice covered hump on the border between Alberta and British Columbia, on the southern slope of Snow Dome at . The exact location of this potential triple point is somewhat indeterminate because the Columbia Icefield and the snow on top of it shifts from year to year. The snow that falls on it (about per year) does not actually flow downhill as water, but creeps downhill in the form of glacial ice. That ice flows down the Athabasca Glacier to the Arctic Ocean via the Athabasca and Mackenzie rivers. Ice flowing west goes to the Pacific Ocean via Bryce Creek and the Bush and Columbia Rivers. Ice flowing down the Saskatchewan Glacier goes via the North Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan, and Nelson rivers into Hudson Bay.

While Triple Divide Peak (or, alternatively, Snow Dome) is the world&#x27;s only oceanic triple divide, there are secondary triple divide points wherever any two continental divides meet. North America has five major drainage systems: into the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans, plus Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Other sources such as the International Hydrographic Organization add a sixth: Canada&#x27;s Northwest Passage basin. Using just the five, there are four secondary continental divides and three secondary triple points, the two mentioned previously and a third near Hibbing, Minnesota, where the Northern Divide intersects the Saint Lawrence Seaway divide. Since there is no true consensus on what a continental divide is, there is no real agreement on where the secondary triple points are located. However, the main Continental Divide described in this article is a far more distinctive geological feature than the others and its two main triple points are much more prominent.

===Hiking trail===

The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDT) follows the Divide through the U.S. from the Mexico–US border to the Canada–US border. The trail itself is a corridor of pathways; that is, dedicated footpaths or back roads, either on or near the Continental Divide. A less-developed Canadian extension called the Great Divide Trail continues through five national parks and six provincial parks, ending at Kakwa Lake in east-central British Columbia.

==Exceptions==
Many endorheic regions in North and South America complicate the simple view of east or west, &quot;ocean-bound&quot; water flow. Several endorheic basins straddle or adjoin the Continental Divide, notably the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming, the Plains of San Agustin and the Animas Valley in New Mexico, the Guzmán Basin in New Mexico and Chihuahua, Mexico, and both the Bolsón de Mapimí and the Llanos el Salado in Mexico. Such basins can be, and routinely are, assigned to one side of the Divide or the other by their lowest perimeter pass; in other words, an assignment is made by determining how the drainage would occur if the basin were to be progressively filled with water until it overflowed. Large-scale maps, such as those on this page, often show double divide lines when endorheic basins are involved. However, the detailed USGS topographic maps of the United States generally show only the main Divide as determined by the overflow rule. Among other things, this eliminates the need to trace out the boundary for a basin that is very shallow and has a nebulous rim, such as the San Luis Closed Basin in Colorado and the basin of the lost streams of Idaho.

Another rare exception occurs when a stream near a divide splits and flows in both directions, or a lake straddling the divide overflows in both directions. Examples of these are, respectively, North Two Ocean Creek and Isa Lake, both located on the Continental Divide in Wyoming. The Panama Canal has this same feature, but is man-made. Both the Chagres and Gatun rivers flow into Gatun Lake, which empties to both oceans.

Several small lakes along the Divide in the Rocky Mountains between Alberta and British Columbia flow into both provinces and thus into both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. An example is the &quot;Committee&#x27;s Punch Bowl&quot;, a small lake located in the Athabasca Pass.

The Alpine Club of Canada&#x27;s Abbot Pass Hut sat directly astride the Divide in Abbot Pass on the boundary between Banff National Park and Yoho National Park, and thus precipitation falling on the eastern half of the roof flowed via Lake Louise into Hudson Bay, while rain falling on the western half flowed via Lake O&#x27;Hara into the Pacific Ocean.

<text>The Great Divide is the first solo album by Scott Stapp, the former vocalist for Creed. It was released on November 22, 2005. The album came about after the original breakup of Creed and Stapp&#x27;s collaboration on the original songs inspired by Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. There is a common conception that the lyrics seem to make references to the original breakup of Creed in 2004. &quot;The Great Divide&quot; was certified platinum on December 14, 2005. John Kurzweg, who produced all three of Creed&#x27;s prior albums, also produced &quot;The Great Divide&quot;. The album received mixed reviews from critics.

<doc id="145796" wikidata="Q1139234" url="?curid=145796" title="Oberon">
<text>Oberon () is a king of the fairies in medieval and Renaissance literature. He is best known as a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, in which he is King of the Fairies and spouse of Titania, Queen of the Fairies.

==Etymology==

Oberon is a variant spelling of Auberon, earlier Alberon, the origin of which is uncertain, though it may be connected with Alberich and Aubrey, or might else be derived from the Old High German elements &#x27;noble&#x27; + (n) &#x27;bear&#x27;.

==French heroic song==
Oberon is first attested as the name of a fairy king in the early 13th century entitled Les Prouesses et faitz du noble Huon de Bordeaux, wherein the eponymous hero encounters King Oberon of the fairies as he passes through a forest. Huon is forewarned by a hermit not to speak to Oberon, but his courtesy causes him to answer the fairy king&#x27;s greetings and so wins his friendship and aid.

The fairy king is dwarfish in height, though very handsome. He explains that, at his birth, an offended fairy cursed him not to grow past three years of age (one of the earliest examples of the wicked fairy godmother folklore motif) but relented and gave him great beauty as compensation. In this story, he is said to be the child of Morgan le Fay and Julius Caesar.

A manuscript of the romance in the city of Turin contains a prologue to the story of &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot; in the shape of a separate romance of Auberon and four sequels and there are later French versions as well.

He is given some Celtic trappings, such as a magical cup (similar to the Holy Grail or the cornucopia) that is ever full. &quot;The magic cup supplied their evening meal; for such was its virtue that it afforded not only wine, but more solid fare when desired&quot;, according to Thomas Bulfinch. 

Shakespeare saw or heard of the French heroic song through the translation by John Bourchier, Lord Berners, called &quot;Huon of Burdeuxe&quot;. In Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary, there is a note of a performance of a play &quot;Hewen of Burdoche&quot; on 28 December 1593.

==&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;==
In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, written in 1595/96, Oberon is the king of all of the fairies and is engaged in a dispute with his wife Titania, the fairy queen. They are arguing over custody of a child whom Oberon wants to raise to be his henchman. Titania wants to keep and raise the child for the sake of her mortal friend and follower who died giving birth to him.

Because Oberon and Titania are both powerful spirits connected to nature, their feuding disrupts the weather. Titania describes the consequences of their fighting:
Oberon tricks Titania into giving him back the child using the juice from a special flower that makes you &quot;madly dote upon the next live thing that it sees&quot;. The flower was accidentally struck by Cupid&#x27;s arrow when he attempted to shoot a young maiden in a field, instead infusing the flower with love. Oberon sends his servant, Puck, to fetch the flower, which he does successfully.

Furious that Titania will not give him the child, he puts juice from a magical flower into her eyes while she is asleep. The effect of the juice will cause Titania to fall in love with the first live thing she sees upon awakening. Titania awakens and finds herself madly in love with Bottom, an actor from the rude mechanicals whose head was just transformed into that of a donkey, thanks to a curse from Puck.

Meanwhile, two couples have entered the forest: lovers Hermia and Lysander are pursued by Demetrius, who also loves Hermia, and Helena, who loves Demetrius. Oberon witnesses Demetrius rejecting Helena, admires her amorous determination, and decides to help her. He sends Puck to put some of the juice in Demetrius&#x27;s eyes, describing him as &quot;a youth in Athenian clothing&quot;, to make him fall in love with Helena. Puck finds Lysander – who is also a youth wearing Athenian clothing – and puts the love potion on Lysander&#x27;s eyes. When Lysander wakes, he sees Helena first and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Demetrius has also been anointed with the flower and awakes to see Helena, pursued by Lysander, and a fight breaks out between the two young men. Oberon is furious with Puck and casts a sleeping spell on the forest, making Puck reverse the potion on Lysander, admonishing Puck to not reverse the effects on Demetrius. Both couples awake and begin the journey back to Athens.

Oberon now looks upon Titania and her lover, Bottom, and feels sorry for what he has done. He reverses the spell using a magic herb. When she wakes, she is confused, thinking that she had a dream. Oberon explains that the dream was real and the two reunite happily. They then return to Athens in the epilogue to bless the couples, becoming once again the benevolent fairy king and queen.

==Other historical and cultural references==
* Oberon is a character in &quot;The Scottish History of James IV&quot;, a play written by Robert Greene.
* In 1610, Ben Jonson wrote a masque of &quot;Oberon, the Faery Prince&quot;. It was performed by Henry Frederick Stuart, the Prince of Wales, at the English court on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1611.
* Oberon is a main character in Michael Drayton&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Nimphidia&quot; (1627) about the fairy Pigwiggin&#x27;s love for Queen Mab and the jealousy of King Oberon.
* In the anonymous book &quot;Robin Goodfellow, His Mad Pranks and Merry Jests&quot; (1628) Oberon is known as &quot;Obreon&quot; and is the father of the half-fairy Robin Goodfellow by a human woman.
* Christoph Martin Wieland first published his epic poem &quot;Oberon&quot; in 1780; it in turn became the basis (as indicated on the title page) for the German opera &quot;Huon and Amanda&quot; (&quot;Hüon und Amande&quot; in German), later known as &quot;Oberon&quot;, by Sophie Seyler. A plagiarized version of Seyler&#x27;s opera called &quot;Oberon&quot; by Karl Ludwig Giesecke with music by Paul Wranitzky debuted in Vienna shortly afterwards. Both operas enjoyed popularity. After extensive performances of the Giesecke version at the coronation of Leopold II in Frankfurt in 1791, it was much performed in Europe until it was surpassed in popularity by Weber&#x27;s opera &quot;Oberon&quot;.
* Oberon and Titania are main characters in the 1789 Danish opera &quot;Holger Danske&quot;, with music by F.L.Æ. Kunzen and libretto by Jens Baggesen.
* Johann Wolfgang Goethe included the figures from Shakespeare&#x27;s work in Faust I. Oberon is married to Titania, and the couple are celebrating their golden wedding anniversary in Faust I.
* In 1826, Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s opera, &quot;Oberon&quot;, (written after a poem by Christoph Martin Wieland translated to an English libretto by James Robinson Planche) debuted at Covent Garden in London, England.
* Oberon appears with Titania in Richard Dadd&#x27;s unfinished painting, The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke, displayed in the Tate Museum.
*Two main characters in John Crowley’s Little, Big, a 1981 multi-generational novel about a family’s interaction with the fae, are named Auberon.

A fanciful etymology was given for the name &quot;Oberon&quot; by Charles Mackay in his book &quot;The Gaelic Etymology of the Languages of Western Europe&quot; along with many other theories on words found in the English language that have not found mainstream acceptance.

==In popular culture==
* In 1830, botanist John Lindley named a flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, &quot;Oberonia&quot; after the fairy king. 
* In the manga and anime &quot;The Ancient Magus&#x27; Bride&quot;, which aired from October 2017 to March 2018, the King of the Fairies is named Oberon and his wife, the Queen of the Fairies, is named Titania.

<text>Bressay Lighthouse is a lighthouse in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, south-east of Lerwick. It is located on the island of Bressay at Kirkabister Ness overlooking Bressay Sound.

==History==
Bressay Lighthouse was one of four lighthouses built in Shetland between 1854 and 1858 which were designed by brothers David Stevenson and Thomas Stevenson. David Stevenson initially maintained that building a lighthouse in Shetland waters was impossible, too dangerous and too expensive, and that any ship&#x27;s captain who took this route was mad.

The shore station was purchased by the Shetland Amenity Trust in 1995 and has been converted into a Marine Heritage Centre. The fog signal was discontinued in the 1980s. The notable red horn was removed, however, the building that housed the siren is still in place and now houses a radar mast, and the five pressurised air tanks are still in place. The 16m lighthouse itself is inactive and closed to the public, its warning light was replaced in 2012 by an automatic 10-mile LED light which flashes twice, every 20 seconds.

The two assistant lighthouse keepers&#x27; cottages are available for short term rental, the principal keeper&#x27;s cottage is let on a longer-term basis.

<text>David Stevenson MICE FRSE FRSSA (11 January 1815 – 17 July 1886) was a Scottish civil engineer and lighthouse designer who designed over 30 lighthouses in and around Scotland, and helped continue the dynasty of lighthouse engineering founded by his father, Robert Stevenson.

==Life==

He was born on 11 January 1815 at 2 Baxters Place at the top of Leith Walk in Edinburgh, the son of Jean Smith and engineer Robert Stevenson. He was brother of the lighthouse engineers Alan and Thomas Stevenson. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh then studied at the University of Edinburgh. In 1838 he became a partner in his father&#x27;s (and uncle&#x27;s) firm of R &amp; A Stevenson. He acquired practical skills in millwright workshops, which inspired him to advocate for hands-on training for engineers in later life.

In 1835, he was asked by Isambard Kingdom Brunel to join his staff at the Thames Tunnel works, an offer which he could not accept as he had been appointed to superintend the construction of other works. 

In 1844 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being David Milne-Home. He was elected as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1844, and subsequently acted as a member of its council from 1877 until 1883, when he retired due to ill health. He was also a member of the Société des ingénieurs civils de France.

In 1853 he moved to the Northern Lighthouse Board. Between 1854 and 1880 he designed many lighthouses, all with his brother Thomas. In addition he helped Richard Henry Brunton design lighthouses for Japan, inventing a novel method for allowing them to withstand earthquakes. His sons David Alan Stevenson and Charles Alexander Stevenson continued his work after his death, building nearly thirty further lighthouses.

In 1836 he made a tour of the United States and Canada, subsequently publishing a book on North American civil engineering in 1838. In 1842 he published &quot;A treatise on the application of Marine Surveying and Hydrometry to the practice of Civil Engineering,&quot; which focused on how engineers could acquire accurate data on which to form designs for harbour and river improvements.

In 1858, his book &quot;The principles and practices of canal and river engineering&quot; was published. It was re-issued in a second expanded edition in 1872. The book provided a detailed overview of various aspects of inland navigation, including the history, construction, and maintenance of barge and ship canals. 

The book also focused on the engineering challenges of canal construction and explored the physical characteristics of rivers, their compartments, and the various engineering works for their improvement, such as tidal flow, removal of obstructions, dredging, and the reclamation and protection of land. 

In the 1860s he lived at 25 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh.

Non-lighthouse engineering included the Edinburgh and Leith Sewerage Scheme, the widening of North Bridge in Edinburgh, and work on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He played a significant role in developing harbours and rivers in Scotland, including works on the Forth, Tay, Ness, Nith, and Clyde. In Ireland, he contributed to the improvement of the Erne and Foyle rivers. 

Notable works in England and Wales included the Dee, Lune, Ribble, and Wear rivers, along with the restoration and enlargement of the Foss Dyke in Lincolnshire. The Foss Dyke was thought to be the oldest canal still in use in Britain, although this has been disputed. This project involved widening and deepening the navigation channel without interrupting traffic. Stevenson was also influential in matters related to salmon fishing in rivers and estuaries in Scotland, and he made a significant report on the subject for the Dornoch Fisheries in August 1842.

In 1868 and 1869 he served as president of the Royal Scottish Society of the Arts. He died in North Berwick on 17 July 1886. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh. The grave lies on the north wall of the original cemetery backing onto the first northern extension.

<text>A civilian is a person who is not a member of an armed force nor a person engaged in hostilities.

It is slightly different from a non-combatant, because some non-combatants are not civilians (for example, people who are not in a military but support war effort or military operations, military chaplains, or military personnel who are serving with a neutral country). Civilians in the territories of a party to an armed conflict are entitled to certain privileges under the customary laws of war and international treaties such as the Fourth Geneva Convention. The privileges that they enjoy under international law depends on whether the conflict is an internal one (a civil war) or an international one.

In some nations, uniformed members (or emergency response force) of law enforcement, the fire service, or other emergency services colloquially refer to members of the public as civilians.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;civilian&quot; goes back to the late 14th century and is from Old French &quot;civilien&quot;. Civilian is believed to have been used to refer to non-combatants as early as 1829. The term &quot;non-combatant&quot; now refers to people in general who are not taking part of hostilities in time of war, rather than just civilians.

==Legal usage in war==
The International Committee of the Red Cross 1958 Commentary on 1949 Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War states: &quot;Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. There is no intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.&quot; The ICRC has expressed the opinion that &quot;If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered &#x27;unlawful&#x27; or &#x27;unprivileged&#x27; combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action.&quot;

Article 50 of the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions provides:
* 1. A civilian is any person who does not belong to one of the categories of persons referred to in Article 4A(1), (2), (3) and (6) of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of this Protocol. In case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered to be a civilian.
* 2. The civilian population comprises all persons who are civilians.
* 3. The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does not deprive the population of its civilian character.

The definition is negative and defines civilians as persons who do not belong to definite categories. The categories of persons mentioned in Article 4A(1), (2), (3) and (6) of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of the Protocol I are combatants. Therefore, the Commentary to the Protocol pointed that anyone who is not a member of the armed forces and does not take part of hostilities in time of war is a civilian. Civilians cannot take part in armed conflict. Civilians are given protection under the Geneva Conventions and Protocols thereto. Article 51 describes the protection that must be given to the civilian population and individual civilians.

Chapter III of Protocol I regulates the targeting of civilian objects. Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court also includes this in its list of war crimes: &quot;Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking part in hostilities&quot;. Not all states have ratified 1977 Protocol I or the 1998 Rome Statute, but it is an accepted principle of international humanitarian law that the direct targeting of civilians is a breach of the customary laws of war and is binding on all belligerents.

==Civilians in modern conflicts==

The actual position of the civilian in modern war remains problematic. It is complicated by a number of phenomena, including:
* the fact that many modern wars are essentially civil wars, in which the application of the laws of war is often difficult, and in which the distinction between combatants and civilians is particularly hard to maintain;
* guerrilla warfare and terrorism, both of which tend to involve combatants assuming the appearance of civilians;
* the growth of doctrines of &quot;effects-based war&quot;, under which there is less focus on attacking enemy combatants than on undermining the enemy regime&#x27;s sources of power, which may include apparently civilian objects such as electrical power stations; 
* the use of &quot;lawfare&quot;, a term that refers to attempts to discredit the enemy by making its forces appear to be in violation of the laws of war, for example by attacking civilians who had been deliberately used as human shields; 
* the term becomes ambiguous in societies that use widespread conscription, or otherwise &quot;militarized societies,&quot; in which most adults have military training. This has been discussed with reference to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

Starting in the 1980s, it was often claimed that 90 percent of the victims of modern wars were civilians. These claims, though widely believed, are not supported by detailed examination of the evidence, particularly that relating to wars (such as those in former Yugoslavia and in Afghanistan) that are central to the claims.
In the opening years of the 21st century, despite the many problems associated with it, the legal category of the civilian has been the subject of considerable attention in public discourse, in the media and at the United Nations, and in justification of certain uses of armed force to protect endangered populations. It has &quot;lost none of its political, legal and moral salience.&quot;

Although it is often assumed that civilians are essentially passive onlookers of war, sometimes they have active roles in conflicts. These may be quasi-military, as when in November 1975 the Moroccan government organized the &quot;green march&quot; of civilians to cross the border into the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara to claim the territory for Morocco - all at the same time as Moroccan forces entered the territory clandestinely. In addition, and without necessarily calling into question their status as non-combatants, civilians sometimes take part in campaigns of nonviolent civil resistance as a means of opposing dictatorial rule or foreign occupation: sometimes such campaigns happen at the same time as armed conflicts or guerrilla insurrections, but they are usually distinct from them as regards both their organization and participation.

Officials directly involved in the maiming of civilians are conducting offensive combat operations and do not qualify as civilians.

== Civilian protection under international humanitarian law (IHL) ==
International humanitarian law (IHL) codifies treaties and conventions, signed and enforced by participating states, which serve to protect civilians during intra and interstate conflict. Even for non-treaty participants, it is customary for international law to still apply. Additionally, IHL adheres to the principles of distinction, proportionality, and necessity; which apply to the protection of civilians in armed conflict. Although, despite the UN deploying military forces to protect civilians, it lacks formal policies or military manuals addressing exactly these efforts. The UN Security Council Report No 4: Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict provides further evidence of the need for protection of civilians. Recognizing that large-scale civilian insecurity threatens international peace and stability, the UN aims to establish the means of protecting civilians and thereby work to ensure regional stability. Through the UN Security Council Report No 4, first published in 2008, the UN offers ways to support civilian protections in both intra and interstate conflict with a goal of encouraging regional states to police their own conflicts (such as the African Union policing African conflicts). Similarly, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan reminded UN Member states that they have common interests in protecting African civilians through a shared &quot;commitments to human security, and its rationale of indivisibility of peace and security.&quot;

Through a series of resolutions (1265, 1296, 1502, 1674, &amp; 1738) and presidential statements the UN Security Council &quot;addresses: 
* compliance with international humanitarian law and relevant human rights law, accountability for violations and humanitarian access;
* the role of UN peacekeeping operations or other UN-mandated missions;
* protection of specific groups;
* the impact of small arms; and
* regional cooperation.
The Security Council is now involved in the protection of civilians in five main areas of action.
* It reinforces general norms—in particular the rules of international humanitarian law.
* It uses its Chapter VII powers to mandate either UN peacekeeping missions or regional organizations or groups of member states to take measures including the use of force to protect civilians.
* It can develop middle ground using its Chapter V, VI and VIII powers to influence parties to conflict in country-specific situations to observe protection norms.
* It uses its Chapter VI powers to try to prevent or limit the outbreak of armed conflict through mediation and other initiatives.
* Finally, the Council can hold parties accountable for violations of international humanitarian law by imposing targeted measures, establishing commissions of inquiry, authorizing ad hoc tribunals or referring situations to the International Criminal Court (ICC).&quot;
In response to presidential statements and previous subcommittee work, the UN Security Council held a meeting in January 2009, specifically to address the protection of civilians within the context of the IHL. While no specific outcome followed this meeting, it did lead to the production of a 10-year assessment of Council actions since the passing of resolution 1265 in 1999.

In addition to the UN treaties, regional treaties have also been established, such as the African Union Constitutive Act Article 4(h) which also outlines the protection of civilians and &quot;affords the Union a right to forcibly intervene in one of its member states in &#x27;grave circumstances&#x27;, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.&quot; This is proposed to indicate the African Union will no longer stand by to watch atrocities happen within the Union. As described by Said Djinnit (AU&#x27;s Commissioner for Peace and Security) in 2004, &quot;Africans cannot [...] watch the tragedies developing in the continent and say it is the UN&#x27;s responsibility or somebody else&#x27;s responsibility. We have moved from the concept of non-interference to non-indifference. We cannot, as Africans, remain indifferent to the tragedy of our people&quot; (IRIN News 2004). Although Article 4(h), while drafted, has not been activated, which raises the question of the AU&#x27;s willingness to intervene in situations of &quot;grave circumstance.&quot;

Regardless of the lead organization (UN, AU, other) &quot;there is clearly a risk involved for international organizations that in assuming a complicated security role such as civilian protection, they may raise expectations among local populations that cannot be met, usually not even by large-scale peace operations with a comprehensive political component, supported by high force levels, overall professionalism, and the political stamina to stay present long-term. The disappointing outcomes, in Africa and elsewhere, have led some to criticize the way in which the decentralization policies have been implemented (MacFarlane and Weiss 1992; Berman 1998; Boulden 2003).&quot;

==Civilians in domestic law==

Most nations clearly distinguish military authorities from the civil administration via the national constitution; or else in statute law where no codified constitution exists. This usually serves to place control of military forces under the presiding civilian government. &quot;Civilian&quot; is often not defined explicitly but is a &quot;negative definition&quot; where anyone who is not designated as military personnel is (by default) a civilian. In keeping with IHL, this offers no intermediary status.

Involvement and jurisdiction of the armed forces in civil affairs varies from nation to nation.

In France and Italy, the National Gendarmerie and Carabinieri are military agencies permanently tasked to supporting domestic civilian law-enforcement, usually focussed on serious organised crime and counter-terrorism. Until 2008, the South African Commando System (a volunteer militia within the South African Army) assisted the Police Service in rural areas until they were replaced by specialised Police units. Section 201 of the South African constitution allows military forces to assist Police only with Presidential approval.

The British military does not intervene in law enforcement matters other than by exceptional ministerial approval. During the 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege, the Metropolitan Police were able to request military support and the Prime Minister approved deployment of the SAS. Unarmed military personnel routinely deploy in support for natural disasters, bomb disposal, etc. under MACA. In 1969 the British Army was deployed to Northern Ireland under Operation Banner to support the local police in the wake of rioting. This deployment inflamed local tensions, with the Provisional IRA launching a guerilla campaign from 1970 to 1997, during which time controversial actions such as Operation Demetrius took place, as well as atrocities such as the Bloody Sunday massacre. Operation Banner ultimately lasted 37 years, formally ending in 2007 and becoming the British Armed Forces&#x27; longest continuous operation. The many problems faced (and arguably caused by) Operation Banner have been influential in policy-making and the reluctance to deploy military forces domestically in anything other than exceptional circumstances (usually relating to serious terrorist threats).

By contrast, German law prohibits entirely the peacetime intervention of military forces within Germany in armed roles. Military personnel may only be deployed in unarmed roles such as disaster relief. This was found to be deeply restrictive during the 1972 Munich massacre when army snipers could not be deployed to assist Munich Police. GSG 9 was later formed within the Bundesgrenzschutz to provide an armed tactical capability within the civilian law enforcement structure.

In the US, the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act forbids the use of the US Army for law enforcement purposes without the approval of Congress. A 2013 directive clarified that this included the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corp. In practice there are many nuances to this. The most notable being that the US Coast Guard operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime but can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy and rendered &quot;military&quot; during times of war. The US National Guard are organised at a State level and under mixed control. Under Title 32, State Governors may deploy National Guard personnel in support of civilian law enforcement - Posse Comitatus would only apply to personnel activated under Title 10 and operating under federal control.

==Colloquial usage==

In colloquial usage, the term is sometimes used to distinguish non-military law enforcement officers, firefighters, EMS personnel, and other emergency services members from the general public. Regardless, such members are civilians - not military personnel - and are bound by municipal, civil and criminal law to the same extent as other members of the public.

In the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand the term &quot;civilian staff&quot; can refer to police employees who are not warranted constables. In keeping with Peelian Principles, the term &quot;member of the public&quot; is preferred by some people to avoid categorizing police as non-civilian.

In the U.S., &quot;Civilian oversight&quot; or &quot;Citizen oversight&quot; is used to distinguish external committees (typically monitoring police conduct on behalf of civil administrations and taxpayers) from the internal management structure.

Civilian crisis management is a central pillar of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which in turn is part of the EU&#x27;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The CSDP is an important instrument supporting the EU&#x27;s role as a global security provider.

Currently, the EU maintains civilian missions in countries including Georgia, Iraq, Mali, Somalia, and the Central African Republic.

<text>Henri Christophe Dickerson (August 25, 1939 – December 23, 2021) was an American professional bodybuilder.

==Early life==
Dickerson was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on August 25, 1939. He was the youngest of triplets. His mother, Mahala Ashley Dickerson, was a lawyer and civil rights advocate for women and minorities. He graduated high school at Olney Friends School in 1957. In 1959, he began attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, studying acting, singing, and ballet. There, a teacher recommended he strengthen his chest to strengthen his voice.

==Bodybuilding career==
One of the world&#x27;s most titled bodybuilders, Dickerson&#x27;s competitive career spanned thirty years; he was known for both his heavily muscled, symmetrical physique and for his skills on the posing dais.

After seeing Mr. Universe Bill Pearl in a magazine, Dickerson changed his focus from acting to bodybuilding, and, at age 24, he began training at Pearl&#x27;s Los Angeles gym. Dickerson first entered a bodybuilding competition in 1965 by taking third place at that year&#x27;s Mr. Long Beach competition. He turned pro in 1973 and won a total of 15 professional bodybuilding titles across four organizations during his career. Bill Pearl trained and advised him throughout his career.

Dickerson was the first African-American AAU Mr. America, the first openly gay winner of the IFBB Mr. Olympia contest, and one of only two bodybuilders (along with Dexter Jackson) to win titles in both the Mr. Olympia and Masters Olympia competitions.

He won the Mr. Olympia once (1982), a distinction he shares with Samir Bannout (1983) and Dexter Jackson (2008) who have since retired, Shawn Rhoden (2018) who has since died, as well as Brandon Curry (2019), Hadi Choopan (2022), Derek Lunsford (2023), and Samson Dauda (2024) who are currently active.

Dickerson retired after winning the 50+ division at the 1994 Masters Olympia and was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2000. Dickerson lived in Florida where he continued to train, conduct seminars, and correspond with current athletes.

==Modeling==
During the 1960s, Dickerson did much physique modeling. His 1970s nude work for photographer Jim French is today considered some of the best in an admittedly limited field. He appeared in French&#x27;s hardcover photo essay, &quot;Man&quot; (1972), and also posed for the photographer ten years later. These photos ran in an issue of Olympus, published by Colt Studios.

==Personal life and death==
Dickerson was gay, which was known in bodybuilding circles, but he did not often publicly discuss this at the height of his career. He later acknowledged that his sexual orientation, along with being black, was a barrier.

Dickerson died on December 23, 2021, at age 82, from heart failure.

<text>The Puffin was a British-built lightvessel situated at Daunt Rock, five miles southwest of Roche&#x27;s Point near the entrance to Cork Harbour, and was in the care of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.

The ship was built in 1887 by Schlesinger Davis &amp; Co. in Wallsend, with yard number 144. Built of iron, it was 28.5 m long and 7.3 m wide, had a draught of 3.4 m and displaced 150 tons.

It sank on 8 October 1896 in a hurricane. The entire crew of eight was lost. In August 1897, the wreck of the &quot;Puffin&quot; was towed into Cobh harbour.

<text>This is a list of [[lighthouse]]s in [[Ireland]]. The Commissioners of Irish Lights are responsible for the majority of marine navigation aids around the island though a small number are maintained by local harbour authorities. The main list identifies those lighthouses in a clockwise direction starting with Crookhaven lighthouse, County Cork.

== Maintained by Commissioners of Irish Lights ==

== Maintained by other Irish marine authorities ==

A smaller number of active lighthouses are operated by other authorities, primarily the port and harbour companies located around the Irish coast.
==Inactive==

Improvements and changes to the aids to navigation around the Irish coast, has meant that there are a number of lighthouses that have been decommissioned. This list includes those where the tower or structure is still in existence. Some of these have been reused, such as Ferris Point which is now a vessel control tower. Clare Island was turned into a guest house and the optic is on permanent rotating display at the World of Glass museum and visitor centre in North West England. The older Wicklow Head tower was refurbished by the Irish Landmark Trust as a holiday let.

<doc id="145809" wikidata="Q745570" url="?curid=145809" title="Unlawful combatant">
<text>An unlawful combatant, illegal combatant or unprivileged combatant/belligerent is a person who directly engages in armed conflict in violation of the laws of war and therefore is claimed not to be protected by the Geneva Conventions.
The International Committee of the Red Cross points out that the terms &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;, &quot;illegal combatant&quot; or &quot;unprivileged combatant/belligerent&quot; are not defined in any international agreements. While the concept of an unlawful combatant is included in the Third Geneva Convention, the phrase itself does not appear in the document. Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention does describe categories under which a person may be entitled to prisoner of war status. There are other international treaties that deny lawful combatant status for mercenaries and children.

The Geneva Conventions apply in wars between two or more opposing sovereign states. They do not apply to civil wars between state forces, whether territorial or third state, and non-state armed groups. A state in such a conflict is legally bound only to observe Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. All parties are otherwise completely free to either apply or not apply any of the remaining Articles of the Conventions. of the Third Geneva Convention states that the status of detainees whose combatant status is in doubt should be determined by a competent tribunal. Until such time, they must be treated as prisoners of war. After a competent tribunal has determined that an individual is not a lawful combatant, the detaining power may choose to accord the individual the rights and privileges of a prisoner of war as described in the Third Geneva Convention, but is not required to do so. An individual who is not a lawful combatant, who is not a national of a neutral state living in the belligerent territory, and who is not a national of a co-belligerent state, retains rights and privileges under the Fourth Geneva Convention and must be &quot;treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial&quot;.

In the United States, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 codified the legal definition of this term and invested the U.S. President with broad discretion to determine whether a person may be designated an unlawful enemy combatant under United States law.

The assumption that unlawful combatant status exists as a separate category to lawful combatant and civilian is contradicted by the findings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Celebici Judgment. The judgment quoted the 1958 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) commentary on the Fourth Geneva Convention: &quot;Every person in enemy hands must be either a prisoner of war and, as such, be covered by the Third Convention; or a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention. &quot;There is no&quot; intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law&quot;. Thus, anyone not entitled to prisoner of war status maintains the same rights as a civilian, and must be prosecuted under domestic law. Neither status exists in non-international conflict, with all parties equally protected under International Humanitarian Law.

==Status of combatants in an interstate conflict==
Under international humanitarian law applicable in an interstate conflict, combatants may be classified into one of two categories: privileged or unprivileged. In that sense, privileged means the retainment of prisoner of war status and impunity for the conduct prior to capture. Thus, combatants that have violated certain terms of the IHL may lose their status and become unprivileged combatants either &quot;ipso jure&quot; (merely by having committed the act) or by decision of a competent court or tribunal.

In the relevant treaties, the distinction between privileged and unprivileged is not made textually; international law uses the term combatant exclusively in the sense of what is here termed &quot;privileged combatant&quot;.

If there is any doubt as to whether the person benefits from combatant status, they must be held as a POW until they have faced a competent tribunal (Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention (GC III) to decide the issue.

===Privileged combatants===
The following categories of combatants qualify for prisoner-of-war status on capture:

# Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
# Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that they fulfill the following conditions:
#* that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
#* that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
#* that of carrying arms openly;
#* that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.
# Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.
# Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war; often dubbed a &quot;levée&quot; after the mass conscription during the French Revolution.

For countries that have signed the &quot;Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&quot; (Protocol I), combatants who do not wear a distinguishing mark still qualify as prisoners of war if they carry arms openly during military engagements, and while visible to the enemy when they are deploying to conduct an attack against them.

===Unprivileged combatants===

There are several types of combatants who do not qualify as privileged combatants:
*Combatants who would otherwise be privileged but have breached the &quot;laws and customs of war&quot; (e.g., committing perfidy or killing surrendered enemy combatants). The loss of privileges in that case only occurs upon conviction, i.e. after a competent court has determined the unlawfulness of the conduct in a fair trial.
*Combatants who are captured without the minimum requirements for distinguishing themselves from the civilian population, i.e. carrying arms openly during military engagements and the deployment immediately preceding it, lose their right to prisoner of war status without trial under Article 44 (3) of Additional Protocol I.
*Spies, i.e. persons who collect information clandestinely in the territory of the opposing belligerent. Members of the armed forces conducting reconnaissance or special operations behind enemy lines are not considered spies as long as they wear their own uniform. 
*Mercenaries, child soldiers, and civilians who take a direct part in combat and do not fall into one of the categories listed in the previous section.

Most unprivileged combatants who do not qualify for protection under the Third Geneva Convention do so under the Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV), which concerns protected civilians, until they have had a fair and regular trial. If found guilty at a regular trial, they can be punished under the civilian laws of the detaining power.

== International law and practice ==
===Interstate conflict===
The term &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; is a legal term only applicable in interstate conflicts and has been used for the past century in legal literature, military manuals, and case law. However, unlike the terms &quot;combatant&quot;, &quot;prisoner of war&quot;, and &quot;civilian&quot;, the term &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; is not mentioned in either the Hague or the Geneva Conventions. So while the former terms are well understood and clear under international law, the term &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; is not.

At the First Hague Conference, which opened on 6 May 1899, there was a disagreement between the Great Powers—which considered &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture—and a group of small countries headed by Belgium—which opposed the very principle of the rights and duties of armies of occupation and demanded an unlimited right of resistance for the population of occupied territories. As a compromise, the Russian delegate, F. F. Martens, proposed the Martens Clause, which is included in the preamble to the &quot;1899 Hague Convention II – Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;. Similar wording has been incorporated into many subsequent treaties that cover extensions to humanitarian law.

==== Prisoners of war ====
The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 12 August 1949 (GCIII) of 1949 defines the requirements for a captive to be eligible for treatment as a POW. A lawful combatant is a person who commits belligerent acts, and, when captured, is treated as a POW. An &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; is someone who commits belligerent acts but does not qualify for POW status under GCIII Articles 4 and 5.

These terms thus divide combatants in a war zone into two classes: those in armies and organised militias and the like (lawful combatants), and those who are not. The critical distinction is that a lawful combatant (defined above) cannot be held personally responsible for violations of civilian laws that are permissible under the laws and customs of war; and if captured, a lawful combatant must be treated as a prisoner of war by the enemy under the conditions laid down in the Third Geneva Convention.

If there is any doubt about whether a detained alleged combatant is a lawful combatant then the combatant must be held as a prisoner of war until his or her status has been determined by a competent tribunal. If that tribunal rules that a combatant is an unlawful combatant then the person&#x27;s status changes to that of a civilian which may give them some rights under the Fourth Geneva Convention.

==== Persons who are not prisoners of war in an interstate conflict ====
A civilian &quot;in the hands&quot; of the enemy often gains rights through the &quot;Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War&quot;, 12 August 1949 (GCIV), if they qualify as a protected person.

If the individual fulfills the criteria as a protected person, they are entitled to all the protections mentioned in GCIV. Under the meaning of Article 4 of GCVI, civilians under their own national authority and of a state not party to the GCIV are not protected persons. Likewise, neutral nationals living in a belligerent country and allied citizens are not protected persons under GCIV as long their states have normal diplomatic relations with a belligerent power.

If a combatant does not qualify as a POW, then, if he or she qualify as a protected person, he or she receives all the rights which a civilian receives under GCIV, but the party to the conflict may invoke Articles of GCIV to curtail those rights. The relevant Articles are 5 and 42.

It is likely that if a competent tribunal under GCIII Article 5 finds they are an &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;, and if they are a protected person under GCIV, the Party to the conflict will invoke GCIV Article 5. In this case, the unlawful combatant does not have rights under the present Convention as granting them those rights would be prejudicial to the security of the concerned state. They do, however, retain the right &quot;... to be treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention&quot;,

If, after a &quot;fair and regular trial&quot;, an individual is found guilty of a crime, he or she can be punished by whatever lawful methods are available to the party to the conflict.

If the party does not use Article 5 of GCIV, the party may invoke Article 42 of GCIV and use internment to detain the unlawful combatant.

For those nations that have ratified Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, are also bound by Article 45.3 of that protocol which curtails GCIV Article 5.

=====Mercenaries=====

Under Article 47 of Protocol I (Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts) it is stated in the first sentence &quot;A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war&quot;.

On 4 December 1989 the United Nations passed resolution 44/34 the &quot;International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries&quot;. It entered into force on 20 October 2001 and is usually known as the UN Mercenary Convention. Article 2 makes it an offence to employ a mercenary and Article 3.1 states that &quot;A mercenary, as defined in article 1 of the present Convention, who participates directly in hostilities or in a concerted act of violence, as the case may be, commits an offence for the purposes of the Convention&quot;.

===== Parole violation =====
A combatant who is a POW, and who is subsequently paroled on the condition that he will not take up arms against the belligerent power (or co-belligerent powers) that had held him as a prisoner, is considered a parole violator if he breaks said condition. He is regarded as guilty of a breach of the laws of war, unless there are mitigating circumstances such as coercion by his state to break his parole. As with other combatants, they are still protected by the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII), until a competent tribunal finds them in violation of their parole.

The Geneva Convention (1929) made no mention of parole, but as it was supplemental to the Hague conventions, it relied on the wording of Hague to address this issue. The authors of GCIII, 1949, decided to include a reference with some modification to parole, because during the Second World War, some belligerent countries did permit such release to some extent.

Article 21 of GCIII (1949) reproduces the Articles 10 and 11 of the &quot;Hague IV: Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;, 18 October 1907, but did not include Article 12, which provides: &quot;Prisoners of war liberated on parole and recaptured bearing arms against the Government to whom they had pledged their honour, or against the allies of that Government, forfeit their right to be treated as prisoners of war, and can be brought before the courts&quot;. Nevertheless, contained in the commentary on GCIII: The only safeguard available to a parole violator—who has been coerced into fighting, and who has been recaptured by the Power that detained him previously—is contained in the procedural guarantees to which he is entitled, pursuant to Article 85 of GCIII.

In the opinion of Major Gary D. Brown, United States Air Force (USAF), this means that &quot;[T]he Hague Convention specified that parole breakers would forfeit their right to be treated as prisoners of war if recaptured. The 1949 Geneva Convention is less direct on the issue. A recaptured parole violator under the Convention would be afforded the opportunity to defend himself against charges of parole breaking. In the interim, the accused violator would be entitled to P[o]W status&quot;.
=== Non-interstate conflict ===
Persons not taking part in fighting in a non-interstate conflict are covered by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions:

Under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, persons under physical control or custody by a party to the conflict should be treated humanely, and if tried &quot;sentences must ... be pronounced by a regularly constituted court&quot;.

Nations that have ratified Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions are legally bound by Article 6 of the Protocol, which extends how the prosecution of persons should be carried out. For instance, defendants cannot be compelled to testify against themselves and sentenced to capital punishment if they are under the age of 18, pregnant women, or mothers of young children.

Since the status of a non-state armed group is not legally recognized in a non-interstate armed conflict, defendants can be sentenced by the legal system of either the territorial or intervening third state for simply taking part in combat against them. On 7 October 2021, a former Taliban commander was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York for the 26 June 2008 attack on an American military convoy that killed three U.S. soldiers and their Afghan interpreter, and 27 October 2008 shooting down of a U.S. military helicopter during the War in Afghanistan (the conflict became non-interstate not long after the United States invasion of Afghanistan ended on 7 December 2001).

The last time that American and British unlawful combatants were executed, after a regularly constituted court, was the Luanda Trial as mercenaries.

==National law==
===United States===
Two separate issues to be determined in evaluating the category &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; as applied by the government of the United States. One issue is whether such a category can exist without violating the Geneva Conventions, and another issue is, if such a category exists, what steps the US executive branch must take to comply with municipal laws as interpreted by the judicial branch of the federal government.

====1942 Quirin case====
The term &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; has been used for the past century in legal literature, military manuals and case law. The term &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; was first used in U.S. municipal law in a 1942 United States Supreme Court decision in the case &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of a US military tribunal over the trial of eight German saboteurs in the US during World War II:

The validity of the case as basis for denying prisoners in the War on Terrorism the protection of the Geneva Conventions has been disputed. A report by the American Bar Association on the case commented:

Since the 1942 Quirin case, the US. signed and ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are therefore considered to be part of US federal law, in accordance with the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution of the United States. In addition, the US Supreme Court invalidated the premise, in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, by ruling that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in the War on Terror and that the Military Commissions that were used to try suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law.

Congress addressed the issues in the Military Commissions Act of 2006 so that enemy combatants and unlawful enemy combatants might be tried under military commissions; however, on 12 June 2008, the Supreme Court ruled, in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot;, that Guantanamo Bay captives were entitled to access the US justice system and that the military commissions constituted under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 fell short of what was required of a court under the United States constitution (see the section below for more details).

==== 2001 Presidential military order ====
In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US Congress passed a resolution known as the &quot;Authorization for Use of Military Force&quot; (AUMF) on 18 September 2001. In this, Congress invoked the War Powers Resolution and stated:

That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.

Using the authorization granted to him by Congress, on 13 November 2001, President Bush issued a Presidential Military Order: &quot;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism&quot; which allowed &quot;individuals ... to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals&quot;, where such individuals are members of the organization known as al Qa&#x27;ida; or has conspired or committed acts of international terrorism, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy. The order also specifies that the detainees are to be treated humanely.

The length of time for which a detention of such individuals can continue before being tried by a military tribunal is not specified in the military order. The military order uses the term &quot;detainees&quot; to describe the individuals detained under the military order. The U.S. administration chooses to describe the detainees held under the military order as &quot;illegal enemy combatants&quot;.

US Secretary of Defense announced Guantanamo Bay detainees would be held as illegal enemy combatants instead of prisoners of war, permitting lack of compliance with the Geneva Conventions. The Bush administration maintained that the terrorists aren’t prisoners of war due to the distinction between unlawful combatant and lawful combatant. Despite this, the administration held that the detainees would be treated in compliance with the Geneva Convention.

With the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, some lawyers in the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel and in the office of White House counsel Alberto Gonzales advised President Bush that he did not have to comply with the Geneva Conventions in handling detainees in the War on Terrorism. This applied not only to members of al Qa&#x27;ida but the entire Taliban, because, they argued, Afghanistan was a &quot;failed state&quot;.

Despite opposition from the U.S. State Department, which warned against ignoring the Geneva Conventions, the Bush administration thenceforth began holding such individuals captured in Afghanistan under the military order and not under the usual conditions of Prisoners of War. For those U.S. citizens detained under the military order, U.S. officials, such as Vice President Dick Cheney, argue that the urgency of the post-9/11 environment called for such tactics in administration&#x27;s war against terrorism.

Most of the individuals detained by the U.S. military on the orders of the U.S. administration were initially captured in Afghanistan. The foreign detainees are held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp established for the purpose at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. Guantanamo was chosen because, although it is under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the United States administration, it is not a sovereign territory of the United States, and a previous Supreme Court ruling &quot;Johnson v. Eisentrager&quot; in 1950 had ruled that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over enemy aliens held outside the USA.

In &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that &quot;the U.S. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cuba&#x27;s ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas&quot;, and that as the United States had complete jurisdiction, the federal courts have the authority under the federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; statute to decide whether foreign nationals (non-U.S. citizens) held in Guantanamo Bay were rightfully imprisoned. This ruling largely overturned the judicial advantage for the U.S. administration of using the Naval Base that &quot;Johnson v. Eisentrager&quot; seemed to have conferred.

==== Legal challenges ====
There have been a number of legal challenges made on behalf of the detainees held in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and in other places. These include:
* On 30 July 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Rasul v. Bush, that it did not have jurisdiction because Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is not a sovereign territory of the United States. This decision was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the decision, (along with a related case in March 2003 – see Al-Odah v. United States). &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; was appealed to the United States Supreme Court on 2 September 2003.
* On 10 November 2003, the United States Supreme Court announced that it would decide on appeals by Afghan war detainees who challenge their continued incarceration at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as being unlawful, (See Rasul v. Bush).
* On 10 January 2004, 175 members of both houses of Parliament in the UK filed an &quot;amici curiae&quot; brief to support the detainees&#x27; access to US jurisdiction.
* On 28 June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; that detainees in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base could turn to U.S. courts to challenge their confinement, but can also be held without charges or trial.
* On 7 July 2004, In response to the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon announced that cases would be reviewed by military tribunals, in compliance with Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.
* On 8 November 2004, a federal court halted the proceeding of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, 34, of Yemen. Hamdan was to be the first Guantanamo detainee tried before a military commission. Judge James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; that no competent tribunal had found that Hamdan was not a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions.
* By 29 March 2005, all detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base had received hearings before Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The hearings resulted in the release of 38 detainees, and confirmed the &quot;enemy combatant&quot; status of 520 detainees. Reuters reported on 15 June 2005 only four detainees had been charged and that Joseph Margulies, one of the lawyers for the detainees said &quot;The (reviews) are a sham ... They mock this nation&#x27;s commitment to due process, and it is past time for this mockery to end&quot;.

Yaser Hamdi was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001. He was taken to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, but was transferred to jails in Virginia and South Carolina after it became known that he was a U.S. citizen. On 23 September 2004, the United States Justice Department agreed to release Hamdi to Saudi Arabia, where he is also a citizen, on the condition that he gave up his U.S. citizenship. The deal also bars Hamdi from visiting certain countries and to inform Saudi officials if he plans to leave the kingdom. He was a party to a Supreme Court decision &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot; which issued a decision on 28 June 2004, repudiating the U.S. government&#x27;s unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend the constitutional protections of individual liberty of a U.S. citizen. The Court recognized the power of the government to detain unlawful combatants, but ruled that detainees must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge. Though no single opinion of the Court commanded a majority, eight of the nine justices of the Court agreed that the Executive Branch does not have the power to hold indefinitely a U.S. citizen without basic due process protections enforceable through judicial review.

On 8 May 2002, José Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, was arrested by FBI agents at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport and held as material witness on the warrant issued in New York (state) about the 2001 9/11 attacks. On 9 June 2002 President Bush issued an order to Secretary Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;. The order justified the detention by leaning on the AUMF which authorized the President to &quot;use all necessary force against those nations, organizations, or &quot;persons&quot;&quot; and in the opinion of the administration a U.S. citizen can be an enemy combatant (this was decided by the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;). Padilla is being detained in Miami and is accused of providing material support for terrorism.
* The 13 November 2001, Military Order, mentioned above, exempts U.S. citizens from trial by military tribunals to determine if they are unlawful combatants, which indicates that Padilla and &quot;Yaser Hamdi&quot; would end up in the civilian criminal justice system, as happened with John Walker Lindh.
* On 18 December 2003, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the Bush Administration lacked the authority to detain a U.S. citizen arrested on U.S. soil as an &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot; without clear congressional authorization (per (a)); it consequently ordered the government to release Padilla from military custody within thirty days. But agreed that he could be held until an appeal was heard.
* On 20 February 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government&#x27;s appeal.
* The Supreme Court heard the case, &quot;Rumsfeld v. Padilla&quot;, in April 2004, but on 28 June it was thrown out on a technicality. The court declared that New York State, where the case was originally filed, was an improper venue and that the case should have been filed in South Carolina, where Padilla was being held.
* On 28 February 2005, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, U.S. District Judge Henry Floyd ordered the Bush administration to either charge Padilla or release him. He relied on the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in the parallel enemy combatant case of Yaser Hamdi (&quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;), in which the majority decision declared a &quot;state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation&#x27;s citizens&quot;.
* On 19 July 2005, in Richmond, Virginia, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals began hearing the government&#x27;s appeal of the lower court (the District of South Carolina, at Charleston) ruling by Henry F. Floyd, District Judge, (CA-04-2221-26AJ). Their ruling, decided 9 September 2005, was that &quot;the President does possess such authority pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution enacted by Congress in the wake of the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed&quot;.
* In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (29 June 2006) the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule on the subject of unlawful combatant status but did reaffirm that the U.S. is bound by the Geneva Conventions. Most notably it said that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, regarding the treatment of detainees, applies to all prisoners in the War on Terror.

====Combatant Status Review Tribunal====
Following the &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;-ruling (November 2004) the Bush administration has begun using Combatant Status Review Tribunals to determine the status of detainees. By doing so the obligation under Article 5 of the GCIII was to be addressed.

However, critics maintain these CSRTs are inadequate to warrant acceptance as a competent tribunal. Their principal arguments are:
* The CSRT conducted rudimentary proceedings
* The CSRT afforded detainees few basic protections
* Many detainees lacked counsel
* The CSRT also informed detainees only of general charges against them, while the details on which the CSRT premised enemy combatant status decisions were classified.
* Detainees had no right to present witnesses or to cross-examine government witnesses.
Notable cases pointed to by critics as demonstrating the flawed nature of the procedure include: Mustafa Ait Idir, Moazzam Begg, Murat Kurnaz, Feroz Abbasi, and Martin Mubanga. A comment by legal experts states:

It appears ... that the procedures of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not qualify as status determination under the Third Geneva Convention. ... The fact that no status determination had taken place according to the Third Geneva Convention was sufficient reason for a judge from the District Court of Columbia dealing with a habeas petition, to stay proceedings before a military commission. Judge Robertson in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld held that the Third Geneva Convention, which he considered selfexecuting, had not been complied with since a Combatant Status Review Tribunal could not be considered a &#x27;competent tribunal&#x27; pursuant to article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.

James Crisfield, the legal advisor to the Tribunals, offered his legal opinion, that CSRT &quot;do not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified as a prisoner of war – only whether the detainee satisfies the definition of &#x27;enemy combatant&#x27;&quot;. Determining whether a captive should be classified as a prisoner of war is the sole purpose of a competent tribunal.

Analysis of these Tribunals by two lawyers for Guananamo detainees, Professor Mark P. Denbeaux of the Seton Hall University School of Law, his son Joshua Denbeaux, and some of his law students resulted in a report called &quot;No-hearing hearings&quot;. In essence it supports the criticism voiced above.

====Military commissions====
As of 17 October 2006, when President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law, Title 10 of the United States Code was amended to include a definition of an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; as

The definition of a lawful enemy combatant is also given, and much of the rest of the law sets out the specific procedures for determining whether a given detainee of the U.S. armed forces is an unlawful enemy combatant and how such combatants may or may not be treated in general and tried for their crimes in particular. Among its more controversial provisions, the law stipulates that a non United States citizen held as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination may not seek habeas corpus relief. Such detainees must simply wait until the military convene a detainee status review tribunal (under the procedures described in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005).

Immediately after Bush signed the Act into law, the U.S. Justice Department notified the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that the Court no longer had jurisdiction over a combined &quot;habeas&quot; case that it had been considering since 2004. A notice dated the following day listed 196 other pending habeas cases for which it made the same claim.

Of the first three war crimes cases brought against Guantanamo Bay detainees under the Military Commissions Act, one resulted in a plea bargain and the two others were dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.

On 4 June 2007, in two separate cases, military tribunals dismissed charges against detainees who had been designated as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; but not as &quot;unlawful enemy combatants&quot;. The first case was that of Omar Khadr, a Canadian who had been designated as an enemy combatant in 2004. Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002. Colonel Peter Brownback ruled that the military tribunals, created to deal with &quot;unlawful enemy combatants&quot;, had no jurisdiction over detainees who had been designated only as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. He dismissed without prejudice all charges against Khadr. Also on 4 June, Captain Keith J. Allred reached the same conclusion in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan.

The United States Department of Defense responded by stating: &quot;We believe that Congress intended to grant jurisdiction under the Military Commissions Act to individuals, like Mr. Khadr, who are being held as enemy combatants under existing C.S.R.T. procedures&quot;. That position was called &quot;dead wrong&quot; by Specter.

====Supreme Court ruling on Military Commissions Act of 2006====

On 12 June 2008, the Supreme Court ruled, in a 5-4 opinion in Boumediene v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to access the US justice system and to habeas relief. The Supreme Court ruled that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 operated as an &quot;unconstitutional suspension&quot; of the writ of habeas corpus. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion:

The Court also ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were &quot;inadequate&quot;. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevens joined Kennedy in the majority.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in his dissenting opinion, called the Combatant Status Review Tribunals:

Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia joined Roberts in the dissent.

Vincent Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, the organization that initiated the action that triggered the Supreme Court ruling responded:

====2009====

In January and February 2009, President Barack Obama&#x27;s nominees for Attorney General and Solicitor General, Eric Holder and Elena Kagan, both testified they agreed the U.S. government may detain combatants in accordance with the laws of war until the end of the war, (this sidesteps the issue of deciding whether the combatant is a lawful or unlawful combatant and the need to try them). When asked by Senator Lindsey Graham &quot;If our intelligence agencies should capture someone in the Philippines that is suspected of financing Al Qaeda worldwide, would you consider that person part of the battlefield?&quot; Both Holder and Kagan said that they would.

On 28 October 2009, President Obama signed the Military Commissions Act of 2009 into law, which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (). While critics said it is an improvement over prior versions of military-commissions passed during the Bush administration, it still fails to provide many of the fundamental elements of a fair trial.

===Other countries===
Israel, since the 2002 &quot;Imprisonment of Illegal Combatants Law&quot;, makes theoretical distinctions between lawful and unlawful combatants and the legal status thereof.

The United Kingdom Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) makes the distinction. The CPS conducted a &quot;through review of the evidence concerning the deaths of Sergeant Steven Roberts of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and Mr Zaher Zaher, an Iraqi national, at Az Zubayr, Iraq on 24 March 2003&quot;:

== International criticism ==
The designation of some prisoners as unlawful combatants has been the subject of criticism by international human rights institutions; including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In response to the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, a legal advisor at the Legal Division of the ICRC, published a paper on the subject, in which it states:

Whereas the terms &quot;combatant&quot; &quot;prisoner of war&quot; and &quot;civilian&quot; are generally used and defined in the treaties of international humanitarian law, the terms &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;, &quot;unprivileged combatants/belligerents&quot; do not appear in them. They have, however, been frequently used at least since the beginning of the last century in legal literature, military manuals and case law. The connotations given to these terms and their consequences for the applicable protection regime are not always very clear.

Human Rights Watch have pointed out that in a judgement, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia interpreted the International Committee of the Red Cross, &quot;Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War&quot; (Geneva: 1958) to mean that:

there is no gap between the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. If an individual is not entitled to the protection of the Third Convention as a prisoner of war ... he or she necessarily falls within the ambit of [the Fourth Convention], provided that its article 4 requirements [defining a protected person] are satisfied.

This does not mean that the status of unlawful combatant does not exist because in the opinion of the ICRC &quot;If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered &#x27;unlawful&#x27; or &#x27;unprivileged&#x27; combatants or belligerents ... [and] They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action&quot;.

Critics of the U.S. internment at Guantanamo Bay worry that the introduction of the &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; status sets a dangerous precedent for other regimes to follow. When the government of Liberia detained local journalist Hassan Bility in 2002, Liberian authorities dismissed the complaints of the United States, responding that he had been detained as an unlawful combatant.

<text>Susan Jane Blackmore (born 29 July 1951) is a British writer, lecturer, sceptic, broadcaster, and a visiting professor at the University of Plymouth. Her fields of research include memetics, parapsychology, consciousness, and she is best known for her book &quot;The Meme Machine&quot;. She has written or contributed to over 40 books and 60 scholarly articles and is a contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

==Career==
In 1973, Susan Blackmore graduated from St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, with a BA (Hons) degree in psychology and physiology. She received an MSc in environmental psychology in 1974 from the University of Surrey. In 1980, she earned a PhD in parapsychology from the same university; her doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Extrasensory Perception as a Cognitive Process.&quot; In the 1980s, Blackmore conducted psychokinesis experiments to see if her baby daughter, Emily, could influence a random number generator. The experiments were mentioned in the book to accompany the TV series &quot;Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s World of Strange Powers&quot;. Blackmore taught at the University of the West of England in Bristol until 2001. After spending time in research on parapsychology and the paranormal, her attitude towards the field moved from belief to scepticism. In 1987, Blackmore wrote that she had an out-of-body experience shortly after she began running the Oxford University Society for Psychical Research (OUSPR):

Within a few weeks I had not only learned a lot about the occult and the paranormal, but I had an experience that was to have a lasting effect on me—an out-of-body experience (OBE). It happened while I was wide awake, sitting talking to friends. It lasted about three hours and included everything from a typical &quot;astral projection,&quot; complete with a silver cord and duplicate body, to free-floating flying, and finally to a mystical experience.
It was clear to me that the doctrine of astral projection, with its astral bodies floating about on astral planes, was intellectually unsatisfactory. But to dismiss the experience as &quot;just imagination&quot; would be impossible without being dishonest about how it had felt at the time. It had felt quite real. Everything looked clear and vivid, and I was able to think and speak quite clearly.

In a &quot;New Scientist&quot; article in 2000, she again wrote of this:

It was just over thirty years ago that I had the dramatic out-of-body experience that convinced me of the reality of psychic phenomena and launched me on a crusade to show those closed-minded scientists that consciousness could reach beyond the body and that death was not the end. Just a few years of careful experiments changed all that. I found no psychic phenomena—only wishful thinking, self-deception, experimental error and, occasionally, fraud. I became a sceptic.

She is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (formerly CSICOP) and in 1991, was awarded the CSICOP Distinguished Skeptic Award.

In an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; on sleep paralysis Barbara Rowland wrote that Blackmore, &quot;carried out a large study between 1996 and 1999 of &#x27;paranormal&#x27; experiences, most of which clearly fell within the definition of sleep paralysis.&quot;

Blackmore has done research on memes (which she wrote about in her popular book &quot;The Meme Machine&quot;) and evolutionary theory. Her book &quot;Consciousness: An Introduction&quot; (2004), is a textbook that broadly covers the field of consciousness studies. She was on the editorial board for the &quot;Journal of Memetics&quot; (an electronic journal) from 1997 to 2001, and has been a consulting editor of the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; since 1998.

She acted as one of the psychologists who was featured on the British version of the television show &quot;Big Brother&quot;, speaking about the psychological state of the contestants. She is a Patron of Humanists UK.

Blackmore debated Christian apologist Alister McGrath in 2007, on the existence of God. In 2018 she debated Jordan Peterson on whether God is needed to make sense of life.

In 2017, Blackmore appeared at the 17th European Skeptics Congress (ESC) in Old Town Wrocław, Poland. This congress was organised by the Klub Sceptyków Polskich (Polish Skeptics Club) and Český klub skeptiků Sisyfos (Czech Skeptic&#x27;s Club). At the congress she joined Scott Lilienfeld, Zbyněk Vybíral and Tomasz Witkowski on a panel on skeptical psychology which was chaired by Michael Heap.

==Memetics and religious culture==
Susan Blackmore has made contributions to the field of memetics. The term &quot;meme&quot; was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;. In his foreword to Blackmore&#x27;s book &quot;The Meme Machine&quot; (1999), Dawkins said, &quot;Any theory deserves to be given its best shot, and that is what Susan Blackmore has given the theory of the meme.&quot; Other treatments of memes, that cite Blackmore, can be found in the works of Robert Aunger: &quot;The Electric Meme&quot;, and Jonathan Whitty: &quot;A Memetic Paradigm of Project Management&quot;.

Blackmore&#x27;s treatment of memetics insists that memes are true evolutionary replicators, a second replicator that like genetics is subject to the Darwinian algorithm and undergoes evolutionary change. Her prediction on the central role played by imitation as the cultural replicator and the neural structures that must be unique to humans in order to facilitate them have recently been given further support by research on mirror neurons and the differences in extent of these structures between humans and the presumed closest branch of simian ancestors.

At the February 2008 TED conference, Blackmore introduced a special category of memes called &quot;temes&quot;. Temes are memes which live in technological artifacts instead of the human mind.

Blackmore has written critically about both the flaws and redeeming qualities of religion, having said, All kinds of infectious memes thrive in religions, in spite of being false, such as the idea of a creator god, virgin births, the subservience of women, transubstantiation, and many more. In the major religions, they are backed up by admonitions to have faith not doubt, and by untestable but ferocious rewards and punishments.

...most religions include at least two aspects which I would be sorry to lose. First is the truths that many contain in their mystical or spiritual traditions; including insights into the nature of self, time and impermanence [...] The other is the rituals that we humans seem to need, marking such events as birth, death, and celebrations. Humanism provides a non-religious alternative and I have found the few such ceremonies I have attended to be a refreshing change from the Christian ones of my upbringing. I am also glad that these ceremonies allow for an eclectic mixture of songs, music and words. In spite of my lack of belief I still enjoy the ancient hymns of my childhood and I know others do too. We can and should build on our traditions rather than throwing out everything along with our childish beliefs.In September 2010, Blackmore wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that she no longer refers to religion simply as a &quot;virus of the mind&quot;, &quot;unless we twist the concept of a &#x27;virus&#x27; to include something helpful and adaptive to its host as well as something harmful, it simply does not apply.&quot; Blackmore modified her position when she saw beneficial effects of religion, such as data correlating higher birth rates with the frequency of religious worship, and that &quot;religious people can be more generous, and co-operate more in games such as the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, and that priming with religious concepts and belief in a &#x27;supernatural watcher&#x27; increase the effects&quot;.

==Personal life==
Blackmore is an advocate of secular spirituality, an atheist, a humanist, and a practitioner of Zen, although she identifies herself as &quot;not a Buddhist&quot; because she is not prepared to go along with any dogma. Blackmore is a patron of Humanists UK. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

On 15 September 2010, Blackmore, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK.

Regarding her personal view on a scientific understanding of consciousness, she considers herself to be an illusionist; she believes phenomenal consciousness is an &quot;illusion&quot; and &quot;grand delusion&quot;.

She is married to the writer Adam Hart-Davis. Blackmore endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome in 1995.

<doc id="145813" wikidata="Q176318" url="?curid=145813" title="Subduction">
<text>Subduction is a geological process in which the oceanic lithosphere and some continental lithosphere is recycled into the Earth&#x27;s mantle at the convergent boundaries between tectonic plates. Where one tectonic plate converges with a second plate, the heavier plate dives beneath the other and sinks into the mantle. A region where this process occurs is known as a subduction zone, and its surface expression is known as an arc-trench complex. The process of subduction has created most of the Earth&#x27;s continental crust. Rates of subduction are typically measured in centimeters per year, with rates of convergence as high as 11 cm/year.

Subduction is possible because the cold and rigid oceanic lithosphere is slightly denser than the underlying asthenosphere, the hot, ductile layer in the upper mantle. Once initiated, stable subduction is driven mostly by the negative buoyancy of the dense subducting lithosphere. The down-going slab sinks into the mantle largely under its own weight.

Earthquakes are common along subduction zones, and fluids released by the subducting plate trigger volcanism in the overriding plate. If the subducting plate sinks at a shallow angle, the overriding plate develops a belt of deformation characterized by crustal thickening, mountain building, and metamorphism. Subduction at a steeper angle is characterized by the formation of back-arc basins.

==Subduction and plate tectonics==

According to the theory of plate tectonics, the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere, its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger tectonic plates and several smaller plates. These plates are in slow motion, due mostly to the pull force of subducting lithosphere. Sinking lithosphere at subduction zones are a part of convection cells in the underlying ductile mantle. This process of convection allows heat generated by radioactive decay to escape from the Earth&#x27;s interior.

The lithosphere consists of the outermost light crust plus the uppermost rigid portion of the mantle. Oceanic lithosphere ranges in thickness from just a few km for young lithosphere created at mid-ocean ridges to around for the oldest oceanic lithosphere. Continental lithosphere is up to thick. The lithosphere is relatively cold and rigid compared with the underlying asthenosphere, and so tectonic plates move as solid bodies atop the asthenosphere. Individual plates often include both regions of the oceanic lithosphere and continental lithosphere.

Subduction zones are where cold oceanic lithosphere sinks back into the mantle and is recycled. They are found at convergent plate boundaries, where the heavier oceanic lithosphere of one plate is overridden by the leading edge of another, less-dense plate. The overridden plate (the &quot;slab&quot;) sinks at an angle most commonly between 25 and 75 degrees to Earth&#x27;s surface. This sinking is driven by the temperature difference between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere, as the colder oceanic lithosphere is, on average, more dense. Sediments and some trapped water are carried downwards by the slab and recycled into the deep mantle.

So far, Earth is the only planet where subduction is known to occur, and subduction zones are its most important tectonic feature. Subduction is the driving force behind plate tectonics, and without it, plate tectonics could not occur. Oceanic subduction zones are located along of convergent plate margins, almost equal to the cumulative plate formation rate of mid-ocean ridges.

Sea water seeps into oceanic lithosphere through fractures and pores, and reacts with minerals in the crust and mantle to form hydrous minerals (such as serpentine) that store water in their crystal structures. Water is transported into the deep mantle &quot;via&quot; hydrous minerals in subducting slabs. During subduction, a series of minerals in these slabs such as serpentine can be stable at different pressures within the slab geotherms, and may transport significant amount of water into the Earth&#x27;s interior. As plates sink and heat up, released fluids can trigger seismicity and induce melting within the subducted plate and in the overlying mantle wedge. This type of melting selectively concentrates volatiles and transports them into the overlying plate. If an eruption occurs, the cycle then returns the volatiles into the oceans and atmosphere.

==Structure of subduction zones==
===Arc-trench complex===

The surface expressions of subduction zones are arc-trench complexes. On the ocean side of the complex, where the subducting plate first approaches the subduction zone, there is often an &quot;outer trench high&quot; or &quot;outer trench swell&quot;. Here the plate shallows slightly before plunging downwards, as a consequence of the rigidity of the plate. The point where the slab begins to plunge downwards is marked by an &quot;oceanic trench&quot;. Oceanic trenches are the deepest parts of the ocean floor.

Beyond the trench is the &quot;forearc&quot; portion of the overriding plate. Depending on sedimentation rates, the forearc may include an accretionary wedge of sediments scraped off the subducting slab and accreted to the overriding plate. However, not all arc-trench complexes have an accretionary wedge. Accretionary arcs have a well-developed forearc basin behind the accretionary wedge, while the forearc basin is poorly developed in non-accretionary arcs.

Beyond the forearc basin, volcanoes are found in long chains called &quot;volcanic arcs&quot;. The subducting basalt and sediment are normally rich in hydrous minerals and clays. Additionally, large quantities of water are introduced into cracks and fractures created as the subducting slab bends downward. During the transition from basalt to eclogite, these hydrous materials break down, producing copious quantities of water, which at such great pressure and temperature exists as a supercritical fluid. The supercritical water, which is hot and more buoyant than the surrounding rock, rises into the overlying mantle, where it lowers the melting temperature of the mantle rock, generating magma via flux melting. The magmas, in turn, rise as diapirs because they are less dense than the rocks of the mantle. The mantle-derived magmas (which are initially basaltic in composition) can ultimately reach the Earth&#x27;s surface, resulting in volcanic eruptions. The chemical composition of the erupting lava depends upon the degree to which the mantle-derived basalt interacts with (melts) Earth&#x27;s crust or undergoes fractional crystallization. Arc volcanoes tend to produce dangerous eruptions because they are rich in water (from the slab and sediments) and tend to be extremely explosive. Krakatoa, Nevado del Ruiz, and Mount Vesuvius are all examples of arc volcanoes. Arcs are also associated with most ore deposits.

Beyond the volcanic arc is a back-arc region whose character depends strongly on the angle of subduction of the subducting slab. Where this angle is shallow, the subducting slab drags the overlying continental crust partially with it, which produces a zone of shortening and crustal thickening in which there may be extensive folding and thrust faulting. If the angle of subduction steepens or rolls back, the upper plate lithosphere will be put in tension instead, often producing a back-arc basin.

===Deep structure===
The arc-trench complex is the surface expression of a much deeper structure. Though not directly accessible, the deeper portions can be studied using geophysics and geochemistry. Subduction zones are defined by an inclined zone of earthquakes, the Wadati–Benioff zone, that dips away from the trench and extends down below the volcanic arc to the 660-kilometer discontinuity. Subduction zone earthquakes occur at greater depths (up to ) than elsewhere on Earth (typically less than depth); such deep earthquakes may be driven by deep phase transformations, thermal runaway, or dehydration embrittlement. Seismic tomography shows that some slabs can penetrate the lower mantle and sink clear to the core–mantle boundary. Here the residue of the slabs may eventually heat enough to rise back to the surface as mantle plumes.

===Subduction angle===
Subduction typically occurs at a moderately steep angle by the time it is beneath the volcanic arc. However, anomalous shallower angles of subduction are known to exist as well as some that are extremely steep.
* Flat slab subduction (subducting angle less than 30°) occurs when the slab subducts nearly horizontally. The relatively flat slab can extend for hundreds of kilometers under the upper plate. This geometry is commonly caused by the subduction of buoyant lithosphere due to thickened crust or warmer lithosphere. Recent studies have also shown a strong correlation that older and wider subduction zones are related to flatter subduction dips. This provides an explanation as to why flat subduction only presently occur in the eastern pacific as only these regions were old and wide enough to support flat slab subduction and why the Laramide flat slab subduction and South China flat slab subduction were possible. Hu ultimately proposes that a combination of subduction age and slab characteristics provide the strongest controls over subduction dips. Because subduction of slabs to depth is necessary to drive subduction zone volcanism, flat-slab subduction can be invoked to explain volcanic gaps.

Flat-slab subduction is ongoing beneath part of the Andes, causing segmentation of the Andean Volcanic Belt into four zones. The flat-slab subduction in northern Peru and the Norte Chico region of Chile is believed to be the result of the subduction of two buoyant aseismic ridges, the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernández Ridge, respectively. Around Taitao Peninsula flat-slab subduction is attributed to the subduction of the Chile Rise, a spreading ridge.

The Laramide Orogeny in the Rocky Mountains of the United States is attributed to flat-slab subduction. During this orogeny, a broad volcanic gap appeared at the southwestern margin of North America, and deformation occurred much farther inland; it was during this time that the basement-cored mountain ranges of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, and New Mexico came into being. The most massive subduction zone earthquakes, so-called &quot;megaquakes&quot;, have been found to occur in flat-slab subduction zones.
* Steep-angle subduction (subducting angle greater than 70°) occurs in subduction zones where Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust and lithosphere are cold and thick and have, therefore, lost buoyancy. Recent studies have also correlated steep angled subduction zones with younger and less extensive subduction zones. This would explain why most modern subduction zones are relatively steep. The steepest dipping subduction zone lies in the Mariana Trench, which is also where the oceanic lithosphere of Jurassic age is the oldest on Earth exempting ophiolites. Steep-angle subduction is, in contrast to flat-slab subduction, associated with back-arc extension of the upper plate, creating volcanic arcs and pulling fragments of continental crust away from continents to leave behind a marginal sea.

== Life cycle of subduction zones ==

===Initiation of subduction===
Although stable subduction is fairly well understood, the process by which subduction is initiated remains a matter of discussion and continuing study. Subduction can begin spontaneously if the denser oceanic lithosphere can founder and sink beneath the adjacent oceanic or continental lithosphere through vertical forcing only; alternatively, existing plate motions can induce new subduction zones by horizontally forcing the oceanic lithosphere to rupture and sink into the asthenosphere. Both models can eventually yield self-sustaining subduction zones, as the oceanic crust is metamorphosed at great depth and becomes denser than the surrounding mantle rocks. The compilation of subduction zone initiation events back to 100 Ma suggests horizontally-forced subduction zone initiation for most modern subduction zones, which is supported by results from numerical models and geologic studies. Some analogue modeling shows, however, the possibility of spontaneous subduction from inherent density differences between two plates at specific locations like passive margins and along transform faults. There is evidence this has taken place in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system. Earlier in Earth&#x27;s history, subduction is likely to have initiated without horizontal forcing due to the lack of relative plate motion, though a proposal by A. Yin suggests that meteorite impacts may have contributed to subduction initiation on early Earth.

Though the idea of subduction initiation at passive margins is popular, there is no modern day example for this type of subduction nucleation. This is likely due to the strength of the oceanic or transitional crust at the continental passive margins, suggesting that if the crust did not break in its first 20 million years of life, it is unlikely to break in the future under normal sedimentation loads. Only with additional weaking of the crust, through hotspot magmatism or extensional rifting, would the crust be able to break from its continent and begin subduction.

===End of subduction===
Subduction can continue as long as the oceanic lithosphere moves into the subduction zone. However, the arrival of buoyant continental lithosphere at a subduction zone can result in increased coupling at the trench and cause plate boundary reorganization. The arrival of continental crust results in &quot;continental collision&quot; or &quot;terrane accretion&quot; that may disrupt subduction. Continental crust can subduct to depths of where it can reach a point of no return. Sections of crustal or intraoceanic arc crust greater than in thickness or oceanic plateau greater than in thickness can disrupt subduction. However, island arcs subducted end-on may cause only local disruption, while an arc arriving parallel to the zone can shut it down. This has happened with the Ontong Java Plateau and the Vitiaz Trench.

==Characteristics and effects==

===Metamorphism===

Subduction zones host a unique variety of rock types created by the high-pressure, low-temperature conditions a subducting slab encounters during its descent. The metamorphic conditions the slab passes through in this process create and destroy water bearing (hydrous) mineral phases, releasing water into the mantle. This water lowers the melting point of mantle rock, initiating melting. Understanding the timing and conditions in which these dehydration reactions occur is key to interpreting mantle melting, volcanic arc magmatism, and the formation of continental crust.

A metamorphic facies is characterized by a stable mineral assemblage specific to a pressure-temperature range and specific starting material. Subduction zone metamorphism is characterized by a low temperature, high-ultrahigh pressure metamorphic path through the zeolite, prehnite-pumpellyite, blueschist, and eclogite facies stability zones of subducted oceanic crust. Zeolite and prehnite-pumpellyite facies assemblages may or may not be present, thus the onset of metamorphism may only be marked by blueschist facies conditions. Subducting slabs are composed of basaltic crust topped with pelagic sediments; however, the pelagic sediments may be accreted onto the forearc-hanging wall and not subducted. Most metamorphic phase transitions that occur within the subducting slab are prompted by the dehydration of hydrous mineral phases. The breakdown of hydrous mineral phases typically occurs at depths greater than 10 km. Each of these metamorphic facies is marked by the presence of a specific stable mineral assemblage, recording the metamorphic conditions undergone but the subducting slab. Transitions between facies cause hydrous minerals to dehydrate at certain pressure-temperature conditions and can therefore be tracked to melting events in the mantle beneath a volcanic arc.

===Arc magmatism===

Two kinds of arcs are generally observed on Earth: island arcs that form on the oceanic lithosphere (for example, the Mariana and the Tonga island arcs), and continental arcs such as the Cascade Volcanic Arc, that form along the coast of continents. Island arcs (intraoceanic or primitive arcs) are produced by the subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath another oceanic lithosphere (ocean-ocean subduction) while continental arcs (Andean arcs) form during the subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath a continental lithosphere (ocean-continent subduction). An example of a volcanic arc having both island and continental arc sections is found behind the Aleutian Trench subduction zone in Alaska.

Volcanoes that occur above subduction zones, such as Mount St. Helens, Mount Etna, and Mount Fuji, lie approximately one hundred kilometers from the trench in arcuate chains called volcanic arcs. Plutons, like Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, generally form 10–50 km below the volcanoes within the volcanic arcs and are only visible on the surface once the volcanoes have weathered away. The volcanism and plutonism occur as a consequence of the subducting oceanic slab dehydrating as it reaches higher pressures and temperatures. Once the oceanic slab reaches about 100 km in depth, hydrous minerals become unstable and release fluids into the asthenosphere. The fluids act as a flux for the rock within the asthenosphere and cause it to partially melt. The partially melted material is more buoyant and as a result will rise into the lithosphere, where it forms large magma chambers called diapirs. Some of the magma will make it to the surface of the crust where it will form volcanoes and, if eruptive on earth&#x27;s surface, will produce andesitic lava. Magma that remains in the lithosphere long enough will cool and form plutonic rocks such as diorite, granodiorite, and sometimes granite.

The arc magmatism occurs one hundred to two hundred kilometers from the trench and approximately one hundred kilometers above the subducting slab. Arcs produce about 10% of the total volume of magma produced each year on Earth (approximately 0.75 cubic kilometers), much less than the volume produced at mid-ocean ridges, but they have formed most continental crust. Arc volcanism has the greatest impact on humans because many arc volcanoes lie above sea level and erupt violently. Aerosols injected into the stratosphere during violent eruptions can cause rapid cooling of Earth&#x27;s climate and affect air travel.

Arc-magmatism plays a role in Earth&#x27;s Carbon cycle by releasing subducted carbon through volcanic processes. Older theory states that the carbon from the subducting plate is made available in overlying magmatic systems via decarbonation, where CO is released through silicate-carbonate metamorphism. However, evidence from thermodynamic modeling has shown that the pressures and temperatures necessary for this type of metamorphism are much higher than what is observed in most subduction zones. Frezzoti et al. (2011) propose a different mechanism for carbon transport into the overriding plate via dissolution (release of carbon from carbon-bearing minerals into an aqueous solution) instead of decarbonation. Their evidence comes from the close examination of mineral and fluid inclusions in low-temperature (&lt;600 °C) diamonds and garnets found in an eclogite facies in the Alps. The chemistry of the inclusions supports the existence of a carbon-rich fluid in that environment, and additional chemical measurements of lower pressure and temperature facies in the same tectonic complex support a model for carbon dissolution (rather than decarbonation) as a means of carbon transport.

===Earthquakes and tsunamis===
Elastic strain caused by plate convergence in subduction zones produces at least three types of earthquakes. These are deep earthquakes, megathrust earthquakes, and outer rise earthquakes. Deep earthquakes happen within the crust, megathrust earthquakes on the subduction interface near the trench, and outer rise earthquakes on the subducting lower plate as it bends near the trench.

Anomalously deep events are a characteristic of subduction zones, which produce the deepest quakes on the planet. Earthquakes are generally restricted to the shallow, brittle parts of the crust, generally at depths of less than twenty kilometers. However, in subduction zones quakes occur at depths as great as . These quakes define inclined zones of seismicity known as Wadati–Benioff zones which trace the descending slab.

Nine of the ten largest earthquakes of the last 100 years were subduction zone megathrust earthquakes. These included the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake which at M 9.5 was the largest earthquake ever recorded, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The subduction of cold oceanic lithosphere into the mantle depresses the local geothermal gradient and causes a larger portion of Earth&#x27;s crust to deform in a more brittle fashion than it would in a normal geothermal gradient setting. Because earthquakes can occur only when a rock is deforming in a brittle fashion, subduction zones can cause large earthquakes. If such a quake causes rapid deformation of the sea floor, there is potential for tsunamis. The largest tsunami ever recorded happened due to a mega-thrust earthquake on December 26, 2004. The earthquake was caused by subduction of the Indo-Australian plate under the Euro-Asian Plate, but the tsunami spread over most of the planet and devastated the areas around the Indian Ocean. Small tremors which cause small, nondamaging tsunamis, also occur frequently.

A study published in 2016 suggested a new parameter to determine a subduction zone&#x27;s ability to generate mega-earthquakes. By examining subduction zone geometry and comparing the degree of lower plate curvature of the subducting plate in great historical earthquakes such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, it was determined that the magnitude of earthquakes in subduction zones is inversely proportional to the angle of subduction near the trench, meaning that &quot;the flatter the contact between the two plates, the more likely it is that mega-earthquakes will occur&quot;.

Outer rise earthquakes on the lower plate occur when normal faults oceanward of the subduction zone are activated by flexure of the plate as it bends into the subduction zone. The 2009 Samoa earthquake is an example of this type of event. Displacement of the sea floor caused by this event generated a six-meter tsunami in nearby Samoa.

Seismic tomography has helped detect subducted lithospheric slabs deep in the mantle where no earthquakes occur. About one hundred slabs have been described in terms of depth and their timing and location of subduction. The great seismic discontinuities in the mantle, at depth and , are disrupted by the descent of cold slabs in deep subduction zones. Some subducted slabs seem to have difficulty penetrating the major discontinuity that marks the boundary between the upper mantle and lower mantle at a depth of about 670 kilometers. Other subducted oceanic plates have sunk to the core–mantle boundary at 2890 km depth. Generally, slabs decelerate during their descent into the mantle, from typically several cm/yr (up to ~10 cm/yr in some cases) at the subduction zone and in the uppermost mantle, to ~1 cm/yr in the lower mantle. This leads to either folding or stacking of slabs at those depths, visible as thickened slabs in seismic tomography. Below ~1700 km, there might be a limited acceleration of slabs due to lower viscosity as a result of inferred mineral phase changes until they approach and finally stall at the core–mantle boundary. Here the slabs are heated up by the ambient heat and are not detected anymore ~300 Myr after subduction.

===Orogeny===

Orogeny is the process of mountain building. Subducting plates can lead to orogeny by bringing oceanic islands, oceanic plateaus, sediments and passive continental margins to convergent margins. The material often does not subduct with the rest of the plate but instead is accreted to (scraped off) the continent, resulting in exotic terranes. The collision of this oceanic material causes crustal thickening and mountain-building. The accreted material is often referred to as an accretionary wedge or prism. These accretionary wedges can be associated with ophiolites (uplifted ocean crust consisting of sediments, pillow basalts, sheeted dykes, gabbro, and peridotite).

Subduction may also cause orogeny without bringing in oceanic material that accretes to the overriding continent. When the lower plate subducts at a shallow angle underneath a continent (something called &quot;flat-slab subduction&quot;), the subducting plate may have enough traction on the bottom of the continental plate to cause the upper plate to contract by folding, faulting, crustal thickening, and mountain building. Flat-slab subduction causes mountain building and volcanism moving into the continent, away from the trench, and has been described in western North America (i.e. Laramide orogeny, and currently in Alaska, South America, and East Asia.

The processes described above allow subduction to continue while mountain building happens concurrently, which is in contrast to continent-continent collision orogeny, which often leads to the termination of subduction.

===Subduction of continental lithosphere===
Continents are pulled into subduction zones by the sinking oceanic plate they are attached to. Where continents are attached to oceanic plates with no subduction, there is a deep basin that accumulates thick suites of sedimentary and volcanic rocks known as a passive margin. Some passive margins have up to 10 km of sedimentary and volcanic rocks covering the continental crust. As a passive margin is pulled into a subduction zone by the attached and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere, the sedimentary and volcanic cover is mostly scraped off to form an orogenic wedge. An orogenic wedge is larger than most accretionary wedges due to the volume of material there is to accrete. The continental basement rocks beneath the weak cover suites are strong and mostly cold, and can be underlain by a &gt;200 km thick layer of dense mantle. After shedding the low density cover units, the continental plate, especially if it is old, goes down the subduction zone. As this happens, metamorphic reactions increase the density of the continental crustal rocks, which leads to less buoyancy.

One study of the active Banda arc-continent collision claims that by unstacking the layers of rock that once covered the continental basement, but are now thrust over one another in the orogenic wedge, and measuring how long they are, can provide a minimum estimate of how far the continent has subducted. The results show at least a minimum of 229 kilometers of subduction of the northern Australian continental plate. Another example may be the continued northward motion of India, which is subducting beneath Asia. The collision between the two continents initiated around 50 my ago, but is still active.

=== Intra-oceanic: ocean/ocean plate subduction ===
Oceanic-Oceanic plate subduction zones comprise roughly 40% of all subduction zone margins on the planet. The ocean-ocean plate relationship can lead to subduction zones between oceanic and continental plates, therefore highlighting how important it is to understand this subduction setting. Although it is not fully understood what causes the initiation of subduction of an oceanic plate under another oceanic plate, there are three main models put forth by Baitsch-Ghirardello et al. that explain the different regimes present in this setting.

The models are as follows: 
# &quot;retreating subduction:&quot; caused by weak coupling between the lower and upper plate which leads to the opening of a back arc basin and the subduction zone being moved by slab rollback.
# &quot;stable subduction:&quot; caused by intermediate coupling between the lower and upper plate. The subduction zone generally stays in the same place and the subduction plate subducts at a consistent angle. 
# &quot;advancing subduction:&quot; caused by strong coupling between the upper and lower plate. The subducting sediments thicken causing partially molten plumes to be on top of subducting plate.

=== Arc-continent collision and global climate ===
In their 2019 study, Macdonald et al. proposed that arc-continent collision zones and the subsequent obduction of oceanic lithosphere was at least partially responsible for controlling global climate. Their model relies on arc-continent collision in tropical zones, where exposed ophiolites composed mainly of mafic material increase &quot;global weatherability&quot; and result in the storage of carbon through silicate weathering processes. This storage represents a carbon sink, removing carbon from the atmosphere and resulting in global cooling. Their study correlates several Phanerozoic ophiolite complexes, including active arc-continent subduction, with known global cooling and glaciation periods. This study does not discuss Milankovitch cycles as a driver of global climate cyclicity.

==Beginnings of subduction on Earth==
Modern-style subduction is characterized by low geothermal gradients and the associated formation of high-pressure low-temperature rocks such as eclogite and blueschist. Likewise, rock assemblages called ophiolites, associated with modern-style subduction, also indicate such conditions. Eclogite xenoliths found in the North China Craton provide evidence that modern-style subduction occurred at least as early as 1.8 Ga ago in the Paleoproterozoic Era. The eclogite itself was produced by oceanic subduction during the assembly of supercontinents at about 1.9–2.0 Ga.

Blueschist is a rock typical for present-day subduction settings. The absence of blueschist older than Neoproterozoic reflects more magnesium-rich compositions of Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust during that period. These more magnesium-rich rocks metamorphose into greenschist at conditions when modern oceanic crust rocks metamorphose into blueschist. The ancient magnesium-rich rocks mean that Earth&#x27;s mantle was once hotter, but not that subduction conditions were hotter. Previously, the lack of pre-Neoproterozoic blueschist was thought to indicate a different type of subduction. Both lines of evidence refute previous conceptions of modern-style subduction having been initiated in the Neoproterozoic Era 1.0 Ga ago.

== History of investigation ==
Harry Hammond Hess, who during World War II served in the United States Navy Reserve and became fascinated in the ocean floor, studied the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and proposed that hot molten rock was added to the crust at the ridge and expanded the seafloor outward. This theory was to become known as seafloor spreading. Since the Earth&#x27;s circumference has not changed over geologic time, Hess concluded that older seafloor has to be consumed somewhere else, and suggested that this process takes place at oceanic trenches, where the crust would be melted and recycled into the Earth&#x27;s mantle.

In 1964, George Plafker researched the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska. He concluded that the cause of the earthquake was a megathrust reaction in the Aleutian Trench, a result of the Alaskan continental crust overlapping the Pacific oceanic crust. This meant that the Pacific crust was being forced downward, or &quot;subducted&quot;, beneath the Alaskan crust. The concept of subduction would play a role in the development of the plate tectonics theory.

First geologic attestations of the &quot;subduct&quot; words date to 1970, In ordinary English &quot;to subduct&quot;, or &quot;to subduce&quot; (from Latin &quot;subducere&quot;, &quot;to lead away&quot;) are transitive verbs requiring a subject to perform an action on an object not itself, here the lower plate, which has then been &quot;subducted&quot; (&quot;removed&quot;). The geological term is &quot;consumed&quot;, which happens the geological moment the lower plate slips under, even though it may persist for some time until its remelting and dissipation. In this conceptual model, plate is continually being used up. The identity of the subject, the consumer, or agent of consumption, is left unstated. Some sources accept this subject-object construct.

Geology makes &quot;to subduct&quot; into an intransitive verb and a reflexive verb. The lower plate itself is the subject. It subducts, in the sense of retreat, or removes itself, and while doing so, is the &quot;subducting plate&quot;. Moreover, the word slab is specifically attached to the &quot;subducting plate&quot;, even though in English the upper plate is just as much of a slab. The upper plate is left hanging, so to speak. To express it geology must switch to a different verb, typically &quot;to override&quot;. The upper plate, the subject, performs the action of overriding the object, the lower plate, which is overridden.

==Importance==
Subduction zones are important for several reasons:
* Subduction zone physics: Sinking of the oceanic lithosphere (sediments, crust, mantle), by the contrast of density between the cold and old lithosphere and the hot asthenospheric mantle wedge, is the strongest force (but not the only one) needed to drive plate motion and is the dominant mode of mantle convection.
* Subduction zone chemistry: The subducted sediments and crust dehydrate and release water-rich (aqueous) fluids into the overlying mantle, causing mantle melting and fractionation of elements between the surface and deep mantle reservoirs, producing island arcs and continental crust. Hot fluids in subduction zones also alter the mineral compositions of the subducting sediments and potentially the habitability of the sediments for microorganisms.
* Subduction zones drag down subducted oceanic sediments, oceanic crust, and mantle lithosphere that interact with the hot asthenospheric mantle from the over-riding plate to produce calc-alkaline series melts, ore deposits, and continental crust.
* Subduction zones pose significant threats to lives, property, economic vitality, cultural and natural resources, and quality of life. The tremendous magnitudes of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions can also have knock-on effects with global impact.

Subduction zones have also been considered as possible disposal sites for nuclear waste in which the action of subduction itself would carry the material into the planetary mantle, safely away from any possible influence on humanity or the surface environment. However, that method of disposal is currently banned by international agreement. Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, making the effects of using any specific site for disposal unpredictable and possibly adverse to the safety of long-term disposal.

<text>Adam John Hart-Davis (born 4 July 1943) is an English scientist, author, photographer, historian and broadcaster. He presented the BBC television series &quot;Local Heroes&quot; and &quot;What the Romans Did for Us&quot;, the latter spawning several spin-off series involving the Victorians, the Tudors, the Stuarts and the Ancients. He was also a co-presenter of &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, and presented &quot;Science Shack&quot;.

Hart-Davis was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 2007.

==Personal life==

Hart-Davis was born and brought up in Henley-on-Thames, the youngest child of the publisher Sir Rupert Hart-Davis (1907–1999) and his second wife, Catherine Comfort Borden-Turner. He was educated at St Andrew&#x27;s Preparatory School, near Pangbourne, and then at Eton College, before reading chemistry at Merton College, Oxford. He then took a PhD degree in organometallic chemistry at the University of York and spent three years as a post-doctoral scholar at the University of Alberta in Canada. Subsequently, he worked at the Oxford University Press, editing science texts and chess manuals. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters) from the University of Bath.

He was married to Adrienne Alpin (m. 1965–1995), with whom he had two sons, Damon and Jason Hart-Davis. His second wife is psychologist Dr. Susan Blackmore, whom he married on 19 June 2010. His siblings are the journalist Duff Hart-Davis and Bridget, the dowager Lady Silsoe. He is an uncle of the journalist Alice Hart-Davis.

== Career in broadcasting ==

Hart-Davis&#x27;s work in broadcasting began in 1977 when he joined Yorkshire Television (YTV) as a researcher, working on material for Magnus Pyke, David Bellamy, Miriam Stoppard as well as &quot;Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s Mysterious World&quot;.

In 1985 he was promoted to production work, producing the Fred Harris-fronted TV show &quot;Me &amp; My Micro&quot; and the Johnny Ball-fronted &quot;Fun &amp; Games&quot;, amongst other things. He also devised and produced the school science show &quot;Scientific Eye&quot;.

In the early 1990s Hart-Davis moved in front of the camera to present two series for YTV: &quot;On The Edge&quot; and &quot;Local Heroes&quot;. The latter programme featured him cycling around the North of England in his trademark fluorescent pink and yellow cycling clothes, seeking out places associated with the great innovators of science and technology. The bicycles were his own, as he is a keen cyclist, owning an early Burrows Windcheetah as well as a mountain bike fitted with an early front monoblade. This series was transferred to BBC2, where its scope became national, a different region being the subject of each episode. &quot;Big Questions&quot;, a five-part Channel 4 science series for young people that he presented received a BAFTA nomination in 2002.

A new television series for the BBC called &quot;The Cosmos – A Beginner&#x27;s Guide&quot; was broadcast on 7 August 2007 by BBC Two, and explored the latest ideas and experiments in cosmology. It was accompanied by a book of the same name.

He also appeared in TV advertisements for HM Revenue &amp; Customs with the catchphrase &quot;tax doesn&#x27;t have to be taxing&quot;. Following a statement from Hart-Davis, in which he mentioned the level of complexities within the UK tax system, his contract with HM Revenue &amp; Customs ended.

==Advocacy of the application and usefulness of science==

Hart-Davis has a passion for raising awareness of simple benefits that science may bring to the quality of living, particularly in the developing world. One such innovation is the design of smoke-hoods from galvanised iron or mud to prevent the deadly effects of smoke inhalation from cooking fires inside houses in the developing world.

He is the Patron of the FatallyFlawed campaign against the use of plug-in socket covers.

He is also Patron of Erasmus Darwin House in Lichfield, the eighteenth-century home of Charles Darwin&#x27;s grandfather, now a museum open to the public.

<text>Sir Rupert Charles Hart-Davis (28 August 1907 – 8 December 1999) was an English publisher and editor. He founded the publishing company Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd. As a biographer, he is remembered for his &quot;Hugh Walpole&quot; (1952), as an editor, for his &quot;Collected Letters of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1962), and, as both editor and part-author, for the &quot;Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters&quot;.

Working at a publishing firm before the Second World War, Hart-Davis began to forge literary relationships that would be important later in his career. Founding his publishing company in 1946, Hart-Davis was praised for the quality of the firm&#x27;s publications and production; but he refused to cater to public tastes, and the firm eventually lost money. After relinquishing control of the firm, Hart-Davis concentrated on writing and editing, producing collections of letters and other works which brought him the sobriquet &quot;the king of editors&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hart-Davis was born in Kensington, London. He was legally the son of Richard Hart-Davis, a stockbroker, and his wife Sybil &quot;née&quot; Cooper, but by the time of his conception the couple were estranged, though still living together, and Sybil Hart-Davis had many lovers at that time. Hart-Davis believed the most likely candidate for his natural father to be a Yorkshire banker called Gervase Beckett. As a child, Rupert Hart-Davis and his sister Deirdre Hart-Davis were drawn by Augustus John and painted by William Nicholson (1912).

Hart-Davis was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, though he found university life not to his taste and left after less than a year.

Hart-Davis decided to become an actor, and he studied at The Old Vic, where he came to realise that he was not a talented enough actor to succeed, and he turned instead to publishing in 1929, joining William Heinemann Ltd. as an office boy and assistant to the managing director Charley Evans. He spent two years with Heinemann and a year as manager of the Book Society; during this period, he built up good relationships with a number of authors and was able to negotiate a directorship for himself at Jonathan Cape Ltd.

In his seven years with Cape, Hart-Davis recruited a successful group of authors ranging from the poets William Plomer, Cecil Day-Lewis, Edmund Blunden and Robert Frost, to the humorist Beachcomber. He was well placed to secure Duff Cooper&#x27;s life of Talleyrand, as Cooper was his uncle. As the junior partner at Cape, he had to handle their difficult authors including Robert Graves, Wyndham Lewis and Arthur Ransome, the last being seen as difficult because of his wife Genia, with her &quot;distrustfulness, venom and guile&quot;. Hart-Davis was a close friend of Ransome, sharing an enthusiasm for cricket and rugby. After Cape&#x27;s death in 1960 Hart-Davis commented to George Lyttelton that Cape had been &quot;one of the tightest-fisted old bastards I&#x27;ve ever encountered&quot;. The second partner, Wren Howard, was &quot;even tighter&quot; than Cape, and neither of them liked fraternising with authors, which they left to Hart-Davis.

In World War II Hart-Davis volunteered for military service as a private soldier, but was soon commissioned into the Coldstream Guards. He did not see active service, never being stationed more than 25 miles from London.

===Independent publisher===

After the war, Hart-Davis was unable to obtain satisfactory terms from Jonathan Cape to return to the company, and in 1946 he struck out on his own, founding Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd, in partnership with David Garnett and Teddy Young and with financial backing from Eric Linklater, Arthur Ransome, H. E. Bates, Geoffrey Keynes, and Celia and Peter Fleming. His own literary tastes dictated which books were accepted and which rejected. Frequently he turned down commercial successes because he thought little of the works&#x27; literary merit. He later said, &quot;I usually found that the sales of the books I published were in inverse ratio to my opinion of them. That&#x27;s why I established some sort of reputation without making any money.&quot;

In 1946 paper was still rationed; the firm used Garnett&#x27;s ex-serviceman&#x27;s ration, but as only one ex-serviceman&#x27;s ration could be used per firm it could not use that of Hart-Davis. However, the firm was given the allocation at cost of a Glasgow bookseller and occasional pre-war publisher, Alan Jackson. The partners decided to start initially with reprints of dead authors, as if a new book became a best-seller the firm would not have paper for a reprint and the author might leave. They made an exception for Stephen Potter&#x27;s &quot;Gamesmanship&quot; which was a short book, collected every ream of paper they could buy and printed 25,000 copies. Likewise 25,000 copies of Eric Linklater&#x27;s &quot;Sealskin Trousers&quot; (five short stories) were printed.

The firm had best-sellers such as &quot;Gamesmanship&quot; and Heinrich Harrer&#x27;s &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, which sold more than 200,000 copies. Also in the early years Hart-Davis secured Ray Bradbury for his firm, recognising the quality of a science fiction author who also wrote poetry. Other good sellers were Peter Fleming, Eric Linklater and Gerald Durrell; but best-sellers were too few, and though the output of Rupert-Hart-Davis Ltd was regularly praised for the high quality of its printing and binding, that too was an expense that weighed the company down. A further expense was added when G. M. Young&#x27;s biography of Stanley Baldwin was published in 1952; both Winston Churchill and Lord Beaverbrook threatened to sue if certain passages were not removed or amended. With the help of the lawyer Arnold Goodman an agreement was reached to replace the offending sentences, but the firm had the &quot;hideously expensive&quot; job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies.

By the mid-fifties, Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd could no longer sustain an independent existence and in 1956 it was absorbed into the Heinemann group. Heinemann sold the imprint to the American firm Harcourt Brace in 1961, who sold it to the Granada Group in 1963, when Hart-Davis retired from publishing, though remaining as non-executive chairman until 1968. Granada merged Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd with sister imprint MacGibbon &amp; Kee in 1972 to form Hart-Davis, MacGibbon.

The Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd logo was a woodcut of a fox, with a background of oak leaves. The company was based at No. 36 Soho Square, London W1. Reprint series published over the years were the &quot;Reynard Library&quot; of great English writers and the &quot;Mariners Library&quot; of nautical books.

===Author===
As Hugh Walpole&#x27;s literary executor, and being unable to find a potential biographer who would tackle the job to his satisfaction, Hart-Davis proposed to Walpole&#x27;s publishers, Macmillan, that he should write the biography himself, to which Harold Macmillan replied that he couldn&#x27;t think of a better person to do it. When &quot;Hugh Walpole&quot; was published in 1952, it was praised as &quot;among the half dozen best biographies of the century&quot;. It has been reissued several times.

Hart-Davis wrote no more books until after his retirement from publishing, but between 1955 and 1962, he wrote about a quarter of a million words to his old schoolmaster George Lyttelton, which, together with Lyttelton&#x27;s similar contribution, made up the six volumes of the Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters, published between 1978 and 1984 after Lyttelton&#x27;s death. Although he spent much of his life researching old letters, Hart-Davis destroyed the originals of the letters after his edited versions of them had been printed. He was equally unscholarly about his uncle Duff Cooper&#x27;s diaries, whose frankness shocked him so much that he wanted to destroy them.

In retirement, Hart-Davis wrote three volumes of autobiography entitled &quot;The Arms of Time&quot; (1979), &quot;The Power of Chance&quot; (1991) and &quot;Halfway to Heaven&quot; (1998). The first, a particularly cherished project, was a memoir of his beloved mother Sybil, who died young, to her son&#x27;s desolation.

===Editor===
Hart-Davis was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the king of editors&quot;. He edited volumes of the letters of the playwright Oscar Wilde, the writer and caricaturist Max Beerbohm, and the writer George Moore, as well as the diaries of the poet Siegfried Sassoon and the autobiography of Arthur Ransome. &quot;A Beggar in Purple&quot;, his commonplace book, was published in 1983. &quot;Praise from the Past&quot;, a collection of tributes to writers, was published in 1996.

His &quot;Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde&quot;, compiled over the same period as Hart-Davis&#x27;s correspondence with George Lyttelton, was described in a review of the latter as &quot;a mammoth undertaking whose difficulties and challenges are documented in great detail in the letters, giving a satisfying portrayal of what dedication in literary scholarship looks like from the inside&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s grandson, Merlin Holland, wrote, &quot;It was his decision fifty years ago to publish the first edition of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s letters which helped to put my grandfather back into the position which he lost in 1895 as one of the most charismatic and fascinating figures in English literary history.&quot;

In his last memoir, Hart-Davis listed the books he had edited as: &quot;The Second Omnibus Book&quot; (Heinemann) 1930; &quot;Then and Now&quot; (Cape) 1935; &quot;The Essential Neville Cardus&quot; (Cape) 1949; &quot;Cricket All His Life&quot; by E.V. Lucas (RHD Ltd) 1950; &quot;All in Due Time&quot; by Humphry House (RHD Ltd) 1955; &quot;George Moore: Letters to Lady Cunard 1895–1933&quot; (RHD Ltd) 1957; &quot;The Letters of Oscar Wilde&quot; (RHD Ltd) 1962; &quot;Max Beerbohm: Letters to Reggie Turner&quot; (RHD Ltd) 1964; &quot;More Theatres&quot; by Max Beerbohm (RHD Ltd) 1969; &quot;Last Theatres&quot; by Max Beerbohm (RHD Ltd) 1970; &quot;A Peep into the Past&quot; by Max Beerbohm (Heinemann) 1972; &quot;A Catalogue of the Caricatures of Max Beerbohm&quot; (Macmillan) 1972 ; &quot;The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome&quot; (Cape) 1976; &quot;Electric Delights&quot; by William Plomer (Cape) 1978; &quot;Selected Letters of Oscar Wilde&quot; (Oxford) 1979; &quot;Two Men of Letters&quot; (Michael Joseph) 1979; &quot;Siegfried Sassoon: Diaries 1920–1922&quot; 3 vols. (Faber) 1981–85; &quot;War Poems of Siegfried Sassoon&quot; (Faber) 1983; &quot;More Letters of Oscar Wilde&quot; (Murray) 1985; &quot;Siegfried Sassoon: Letters to Max Beerbohm&quot; (Faber) 1986; &quot;Letters of Max Beerbohm&quot; (Murray) 1986.

===Ancestry and personal life===
Hart-Davis was a great-great-great-grandson of William IV. William had several illegitimate children with his mistress, Dora Jordan. Their youngest daughter, Lady Elizabeth Fitzclarence, later Countess of Erroll, had daughters including Lady Agnes Hay. Lady Agnes married James Duff, 5th Earl Fife, and among their children was Lady Agnes Duff, who married Sir Alfred Cooper. Their children included Sybil Cooper, mother of Rupert Hart-Davis.

While still an actor, Hart-Davis met the young Peggy Ashcroft whom he married in 1929. The marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce in 1933, though the two remained warm friends until Ashcroft&#x27;s death more than sixty years later.

In November 1933, he married Catherine Comfort Borden-Turner. They had a daughter in 1935, Bridget, who went on to marry David Trustram Eve, 2nd Baron Silsoe, in 1963, and two sons, Duff in 1936, and the TV presenter Adam in 1943. The second marriage became dysfunctional, although husband and wife remained on good terms and stayed together until their children were grown up, when Hart-Davis and Comfort divorced. In 1964, he married Ruth Simon Ware, with whom he had had a long-term relationship. After her death in 1967, he married June Williams in 1968, who outlived him. She died in 2017.

After the war, until his retirement, Hart-Davis lived during the week in a flat above his publishing business in Soho Square, returning to his main home at Bromsden Farm, Oxfordshire, at weekends. He retired to Marske in North Yorkshire, where he died at the age of 92.

===Public service and honours===
From 1957 to 1969, Hart-Davis was chairman of the London Library. During this period, a financial crisis arose when Westminster City Council decided that the library should no longer qualify for charitable exemption from local property tax. Hart-Davis organised fund-raising on a grand scale, including an auction, with E. M. Forster offering the manuscript of &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, and T. S. Eliot, a duplicate manuscript of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. Hart-Davis was also secretary of The Literary Society and a member of A. P. Herbert&#x27;s committee on censorship.

Public honours included honorary doctorates from the universities of Durham and Reading and a knighthood in 1967 for services to literature.

Twenty-two books were dedicated to him between 1936 and 1998, including works by H. E. Bates, Edmund Blunden, C. Day-Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Lady Diana Cooper, Eric Linklater, Compton Mackenzie, &quot;Books Do Furnish a Room&quot; by Anthony Powell and Leon Edel. Merlin Holland&#x27;s &quot;Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters&quot; (2003) was dedicated &quot;To the memory of Rupert Hart-Davis, with love and gratitude.&quot;

<doc id="145817" wikidata="Q762675" url="?curid=145817" title="Coenwulf of Mercia">
<text>Coenwulf (; also spelled Cenwulf, Kenulf, or Kenwulph; ) was the king of Mercia from December 796 until his death in 821. He was a descendant of King Pybba, who ruled Mercia in the early 7th century. He succeeded Ecgfrith, the son of Offa; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months, and Coenwulf ascended the throne in the same year that Offa died. In the early years of Coenwulf&#x27;s reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent, which had been under Offa&#x27;s control. Eadberht Præn returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne, and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene. When Pope Leo III agreed to anathematise Eadberht, Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom; Eadberht was taken prisoner, was blinded, and had his hands cut off. Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign, as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald. Coenwulf&#x27;s coinage reappears in 805, indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control. Several campaigns of Coenwulf&#x27;s against the Welsh are recorded, but only one conflict with Northumbria, in 801, though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf.

Coenwulf came into conflict with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury over the issue of whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in the relationship between the two eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf&#x27;s successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf&#x27;s daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf&#x27;s grants of religious property.

Coenwulf was succeeded by his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims that his son Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed permanently out of Coenwulf&#x27;s family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Within a decade of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia never recovered its former position of power.

==Background and sources==
For most of the 8th century, Mercia was dominant among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. Æthelbald, who came to the throne in 716, had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa&#x27;s daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter. In Kent, Offa intervened decisively in the 780s, and at some point became the overlord of East Anglia, whose king, Æthelred, was beheaded on Offa&#x27;s orders in 794.

Offa appears to have moved to eliminate dynastic rivals to the succession of his son, Ecgfrith. According to a contemporary letter from Alcuin of York, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade as a chief advisor at Charlemagne&#x27;s court, &quot;the vengeance of the blood shed by the father has reached the son&quot;; Alcuin added, &quot;This was not a strengthening of the kingdom, but its ruin.&quot; Offa died in July 796. Ecgfrith succeeded him but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf came to the throne.

A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from Alcuin, who corresponded with kings, nobles, and ecclesiastics throughout England. Letters between Coenwulf and the papacy also survive. Another key source for the period is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex. Charters dating from Coenwulf&#x27;s reign have survived; these were documents granting land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where Æthelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a &quot;subregulus&quot;, or subking, of Æthelbald.

==Mercia and southern England at Ecgfrith&#x27;s death==
According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days. Offa is known to have died in 796, on either 26 July or 29 July, so Ecgfrith&#x27;s date of death is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year. Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king. Coenwulf&#x27;s father&#x27;s name was Cuthberht, who may have been the same person as an ealdorman of that name who witnessed charters during the reign of Offa. Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa&#x27;s reign. According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh, of whom there is no other record. It is possible that this refers to Cenwealh of Wessex, who was married to (and later repudiated) a sister of Penda.

Coenwulf&#x27;s kin may have been connected to the royal family of the Hwicce, a subkingdom of Mercia around the lower river Severn. It appears that Coenwulf&#x27;s family were powerful, but they were not of recent Mercian royal lineage. A letter written by Alcuin to the people of Kent in 797 laments that &quot;scarcely anyone is found now of the old stock of kings&quot;. Eardwulf of Northumbria had, like Coenwulf, gained his throne in 796, so Alcuin&#x27;s meaning is not clear, but it may be that he intended it as a slur on Eardwulf or Coenwulf or on both. Alcuin certainly held negative views of Coenwulf, regarding him as a tyrant and criticising him for putting aside one wife and taking another. Alcuin wrote to a Mercian nobleman to ask him to greet Coenwulf peaceably &quot;if it is possible to do so&quot;, implying uncertainty about Coenwulf&#x27;s policy towards the Carolingians.

Coenwulf&#x27;s early reign was marked by a breakdown in Mercian control in southern England. In East Anglia, King Eadwald minted coins at about this time, implying that he was no longer subject to Mercia. A charter of 799 seems to show that Wessex and Mercia were estranged for some time before that date, though the charter is not regarded as undoubtedly genuine. In Kent, an uprising began, probably starting after Ecgfrith&#x27;s death, though it has been suggested that it began much earlier in the year, before Offa&#x27;s death. The uprising was led by Eadberht Præn, who had been an exile at Charlemagne&#x27;s court: Eadberht&#x27;s cause almost certainly had Carolingian support. Eadberht became king of Kent, and Æthelheard, the archbishop of Canterbury at that time, fled his see; it is likely that Christ Church, Canterbury was sacked.

==Reign==
Coenwulf was unwilling to take military action in Kent without acknowledgement from Pope Leo III that Eadberht was a pretender. The basis for this assertion was that Eadberht had reportedly been a priest, and as such had given up any right to the throne. Coenwulf wrote to the Pope and asked Leo to consider making London the seat of the southern archbishopric, removing the honour from Canterbury; it is likely that Coenwulf&#x27;s reasons included the loss of Mercian control over Kent. Leo refused to agree to moving the archiepiscopate to London, but in the same letter he agreed that Eadberht&#x27;s previous ordination made him ineligible for the throne:

This authorisation from the Pope to proceed against Eadberht was delayed until 798, but once it was received Coenwulf took action. The Mercians captured Eadberht, put out his eyes and cut off his hands, and led him in chains to Mercia, where according to later tradition he was imprisoned at Winchcombe, a religious house closely affiliated with Coenwulf&#x27;s family. By 801 at the latest Coenwulf had placed his brother, Cuthred, on the throne of Kent. Cuthred ruled until the time of his death in 807, after which Coenwulf took control of Kent in name as well as fact. Coenwulf styled himself &quot;King of the Mercians and the Province of Kent&quot; (&quot;rex Merciorum atque provincie Cancie&quot;) in a charter dated 809.

Offa&#x27;s domination of the kingdom of Essex was continued by Coenwulf. King Sigeric of Essex left for Rome in 798, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, presumably abdicating the throne in favour of his son, Sigered. Sigered appears on two charters of Coenwulf&#x27;s in 811 as king (&quot;rex&quot;) of Essex, but his title is reduced thereafter, first to &quot;subregulus&quot;, or subking, and thereafter to &quot;dux&quot; or ealdorman.
The course of events in East Anglia is less clear, but Eadwald&#x27;s coinage ceased, and new coinage issued by Coenwulf began by about 805, so it is likely that Coenwulf forcibly re-established Mercian dominance there. The resumption of friendly relations with Wessex under Beorhtric received a setback when Beorhtric died and the throne of Wessex passed to Egbert, who, like Eadberht, had been an exile at Charlemagne&#x27;s court. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that on the same day that Egbert came to the throne, an ealdorman of the Hwicce named Æthelmund led a force across the Thames at Kempsford but was defeated by the men of Wiltshire under the leadership of Weohstan, also an ealdorman. Egbert may also have had a claim on the Kentish throne, according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, but he made no move to recover it during Coenwulf&#x27;s reign. Egbert appears to have been independent of Mercia from the beginning of his reign, and Wessex&#x27;s independence meant that Coenwulf was never able to claim the overlordship of the southern English that had belonged to Offa and Æthelbald. He did, however, claim the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; on one charter, the only Anglo-Saxon king to do so before the 10th century.

In 796 or 797 the Welsh engaged Mercian forces at Rhuddlan. By 798 Coenwulf was in a position to invade in return, killing Caradog ap Meirion, the King of Gwynedd. A civil war in Gwynedd in the 810s ended with the succession of Hywel ap Caradog in 816 or 817, and Coenwulf invaded again, this time ravaging Snowdonia and taking control of Rhufuniog, a small Welsh territory near Rhos. It is not clear if the Mercians were involved in a battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818, but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed.

The Northumbrian king, Æthelred, was assassinated in April 796, and less than a month later his successor, Osbald, was deposed in favour of Eardwulf. Eardwulf had Alhmund killed in 800; Alhmund was the son of King Alhred of Northumbria, who had reigned from 765 to 774. Alhmund&#x27;s death was regarded as a martyrdom, and his cult subsequently developed at Derby, in Mercian territory, perhaps implying Mercian involvement in Northumbrian politics at the time. Coenwulf gave hospitality to Eardwulf&#x27;s enemies, who had been exiled from Northumbria, and consequently Eardwulf invaded Mercia in 801. The invasion was inconclusive, however, and peace was arranged on equal terms. Coenwulf may also have been behind the coup in 806 that led to Eardwulf losing his throne, and he likely continued to support Eardwulf&#x27;s enemies after Eardwulf returned in 808.

==Relations with the church==
In 787, Offa had persuaded the Church to create a new archbishopric at Lichfield, dividing the archdiocese of Canterbury. The new archdiocese included the sees of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham; these were essentially the midland Anglian territories. Canterbury retained the sees in the south and southeast. Hygeberht, already Bishop of Lichfield, was the new archdiocese&#x27;s first and only archbishop.

Two versions of the events that led to the creation of the new archdiocese appear in the form of an exchange of letters in 798 between Coenwulf and Pope Leo III. Coenwulf asserted in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time of the division; but Leo responded that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia. The comments of both Coenwulf and Leo are partisan, as each had his own reasons for representing the situation as they did: Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese, while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa. Coenwulf&#x27;s desire to move the southern archbishopric to London would have been influenced by the situation in Kent, where Archbishop Æthelheard had been forced to flee by Eadberht Præn. Coenwulf would have wished to retain control over the archiepiscopal seat, and at the time he wrote to the pope Kent was independent of Mercia.

Æthelheard, who had succeeded Jaenberht in 792, had been the abbot of a monastery at Louth in Lindsey. On 18 January 802 Æthelheard received a papal privilege that re-established his authority over all the churches in the archdiocese of Lichfield as well as those of Canterbury. Æthelheard held a council at Clovesho on 12 October 803 which finally stripped Lichfield of its archiepiscopal status. However, it appears that Hygeberht had already been removed from his office; a Hygeberht attended the council of Clovesho as the head of the Church in Mercia but signed as an abbot.

Archbishop Æthelheard died in 805 and was succeeded by Wulfred. Wulfred was given freedom to mint coins that did not name Coenwulf on the reverse, probably indicating that Wulfred was on good terms with the Mercian king. In 808 there was evidently a rift of some kind: a letter from Pope Leo to Charlemagne mentioned that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with Wulfred. After this no further discord is mentioned until 816, when Wulfred presided over a council which attacked lay control of religious houses. The council, held at Chelsea, asserted that Coenwulf did not have the right to make appointments to nunneries and monasteries, although both Leo and his predecessor, Pope Hadrian I, had granted Offa and Coenwulf the right to do so. Coenwulf had recently appointed his daughter, Cwoenthryth, to the position of abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. Leo died in 816, and his successor, Stephen IV, died the following January; the new pope, Paschal I confirmed Coenwulf&#x27;s privileges but this did not end the dispute. In 817 Wulfred witnessed two charters in which Coenwulf granted land to Deneberht, bishop of Worcester, but there is no further record of Wulfred acting as archbishop for the rest of Coenwulf&#x27;s reign. One account records that the quarrel between Wulfred and Coenwulf led to Wulfred being deprived of his office for six years, with no baptisms taking place during that time, but this may have been an exaggeration, with four years being the more likely term of the suspension.

In 821, the year of Coenwulf&#x27;s death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf threatened to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king. Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf&#x27;s death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf&#x27;s daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf&#x27;s brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so it is evident that some accommodation had been reached by that time. Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.

==Coinage==

The coinage of Coenwulf follows the broad silver penny format established under Offa and his contemporaries. His very first coins are very similar to the heavy coinage of Offa&#x27;s last three years, and since the mints at Canterbury and in East Anglia were under the control of Eadbert Præn and Eadwald, respectively, these earliest pennies must be the product of the London mint. Before 798 the new &quot;tribrach&quot; type appeared, with a design consisting of three radial lines meeting at the centre. The tribrach design was introduced initially at London alone but soon spread to Canterbury after it was reconquered from the rebels. It was not struck in East Anglia, but there are tribrach pennies in the name of Cuthred, sub-king of Kent. Around 805 a new portrait coinage was introduced to all three of the southern mints. After around 810 a range of reverse designs was introduced, though several were common to many or all of the moneyers. From this date there is also evidence of a new mint, at Rochester in Kent.

A gold coin bearing the name Coenwulf was discovered in 2001 at Biggleswade in Bedfordshire, England, on a footpath beside the River Ivel. The mancus, worth about 30 silver pennies, is only the eighth-known Anglo-Saxon gold coin dating to the mid-to-late Anglo-Saxon period.
The coin&#x27;s inscription, &quot;DE VICO LVNDONIAE&quot;, indicates that it was minted in London.
It has seen little or no circulation, as it was probably lost shortly after it was issued.
The similarity to a coin of Charlemagne inscribed &quot;vico Duristat&quot; has been taken to suggest that the two coins reflect a rivalry between the two kings, although it is unknown which coin has priority.
Initially sold to American collector Allan Davisson for £230,000 at an auction held by Spink auction house in 2004, the British Government subsequently put in place an export ban in the hope of saving it for the British public. In February 2006 the coin was bought by the British Museum for £357,832 with the help of funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and The British Museum Friends making it the most expensive British coin purchased until then, though the price was exceeded the following July by the third-known example of a Double Leopard.

==Family and succession==
A charter of 799 records a wife of Coenwulf named Cynegyth; the charter is forged, but this detail is possibly accurate. Ælfthryth is more reliably established as Coenwulf&#x27;s wife, again from charter evidence; she is recorded on charters dated between 804 and 817. Coenwulf&#x27;s daughter, Cwoenthryth, survived him and inherited the monastery at Winchcombe which Coenwulf had established as part of the patrimony of his family. Cwoenthryth subsequently was engaged in a long dispute with Archbishop Wulfred over her rights to the monastery. Coenwulf also had a son, Cynehelm, who later became known as a saint, with a cult dating from at least the 970s. According to Alfred the Great&#x27;s biographer, the Welsh monk and bishop, Asser, Alfred&#x27;s wife Ealhswith was descended from Coenwulf through her mother, Eadburh, though Asser does not say which of Coenwulf&#x27;s children Eadburh descends from.

Coenwulf died in 821 at Basingwerk near Holywell, Flintshire, probably while making preparations for a campaign against the Welsh that took place under his brother and successor, Ceolwulf, the following year. Coenwulf&#x27;s body was moved to Winchcombe where it was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Abbey (later known as Winchcombe Abbey). A mid-11th-century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child and was then murdered by his tutor Æscberht at the behest of Cwoenthryth. This version of events &quot;bristles with historical problems&quot;, according to one historian, and it is also possible that Cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in Coenwulf&#x27;s reign, and who appears to have died by about 812. The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point: Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father&#x27;s reign. Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm&#x27;s legend, there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf&#x27;s reign: a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf &quot;much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings, nobles, bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business&quot;.

Coenwulf was the last of a series of Mercian kings, beginning with Penda in the early 7th century, to exercise dominance over most or all of southern England. In the years after his death, Mercia&#x27;s position weakened, and the battle of Ellendun in 825 firmly established Egbert of Wessex as the dominant king south of the Humber.

The Anglo-Saxonist and historian John Blair has identified evidence that Coenwulf came to be venerated as a saint, at least by the 12th century, and included him in his &#x27;Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints&#x27;. The evidence is that the king appears to have been honoured as a &#x27;holy benefactor&#x27; [Blair] at Winchcombe Abbey in the 12th century, and that a relic of &quot;Sanctus Kenulfus&quot; appears in a 12th-century relic list from Peterborough Abbey.

<doc id="145823" wikidata="Q772239" url="?curid=145823" title="Obduction">
<text>Obduction is a geological process whereby denser oceanic crust (and even upper mantle) is scraped off a descending ocean plate at a convergent plate boundary and thrust on top of an adjacent plate. When oceanic and continental plates converge, normally the denser oceanic crust sinks under the continental crust in the process of subduction. Obduction, which is less common, normally occurs in plate collisions at orogenic belts (some of the material from the subducting oceanic plate is emplaced onto the continental plate) or back-arc basins (regions where the edge of a continent is pulled away from the rest of the continent due to the stress of plate collision).

Obduction of oceanic lithosphere produces a characteristic set of rock types called an ophiolite. This assemblage consists of deep-marine sedimentary rock (chert, limestone, clastic sediments), volcanic rocks (pillow lavas, volcanic glass, volcanic ash, sheeted dykes and gabbros) and peridotite (mantle rock). John McPhee describes ophiolite formation by obduction as &quot;where ocean crust slides into a trench and goes under a continent, [and] a part of the crust—i.e., an ophiolite—is shaved off the top and ends up on the lip of the continent.&quot;

Obduction can occur where a fragment of continental crust is caught in a subduction zone with resulting overthrusting of oceanic mafic and ultramafic rocks from the mantle onto the continental crust. Obduction often occurs where a small tectonic plate is caught between two larger plates, with the crust (both island arc and oceanic) welding onto an adjacent continent as a new terrane. When two continental plates collide, obduction of the oceanic crust between them is often a part of the resulting orogeny.

==Formation types==

===Upwedging in subduction zones===
This process is operative beneath and behind the inner walls of oceanic trenches (subduction zone) where slices of oceanic crust and mantle are ripped from the upper part of the descending plate and wedged and packed in high pressure assemblages against the leading edge of the other plate.

Weakening and cracking of oceanic crust and upper mantle is likely to occur in the tensional regime. This results in the incorporation of ophiolite slabs into the overriding plate. Progressive packing of ophiolite slices and arc fragments against the leading edge of a continent may continue over a long period of time and lead to a form of continental accretion.

===Compressional telescoping onto Atlantic-type continental margins===
The simplest form of this type of obduction may follow from the development of a subduction zone near the continental margin. Above and behind the subduction zone, a welt of oceanic crust and mantle rides up over the descending plate. The ocean, intervening between the continental margin and the subduction zone is progressively swallowed until the continental margin arrives at the subduction zone and a giant wedge or slice (nappe) of oceanic crust and mantle is pushed across the continental margin. Because the buoyancy of the relatively light continental crust is likely to prohibit its extensive subduction, a flip in subduction polarity will occur yielding an ophiolite sheet lying above a descending plate.

If however, a large tract of ocean intervenes between the continental margin the subduction zone, a fully developed arc and back-arc basin may eventually arrive and collide with the continental margin. Further convergence may lead to overthrusting of the volcanic arc assemblage and may be followed by flipping of the subduction polarity. According to the rock assemblage as well as the complexly deformed ophiolite basement and arc intrusions, the Coastal Complex of western Newfoundland may well have been formed by this mechanism.

===Gravity sliding onto Atlantic-type continental margins===
This concept involves the progressive uplift of an actively spreading oceanic ridge, the detachment of slices from the upper part of the lithosphere, and the subsequent gravity sliding of these slices onto the continental margin as ophiolites. This concept was advocated by Reinhardt for the emplacement of the Semail Ophiolite complex in Oman and argued by Church and Church and Stevens for the emplacement of the Bay of Islands sheet in western Newfoundland. This concept has subsequently been replaced by hypotheses that advocate subduction of the continental margin beneath oceanic lithosphere.

===Transformation of a spreading ridge to a subduction zone===
Many ophiolite complexes were emplaced as thin, hot obducted sheets of oceanic lithosphere shortly after their generation by plate accretion. The change from a spreading plate boundary to a subduction plate boundary may result from rapid rearrangement of relative plate motion. A transform fault may also become a subduction zone, with the side with the higher, hotter, thinner lithosphere riding over the lower, colder lithosphere. This mechanism would lead to obduction of ophiolite complex if it occurred near a continental margin.

===Interference of a spreading ridge and a subduction zone===
In the situation where a spreading ridge approaches a subduction zone, the ridge collides with the subduction zone, at which time there will develop a complex interaction of subduction-related tectonic sedimentary rock and spreading-related tectonic igneous activity. The left-over ridge may either subduct or ride upward across the trench onto arc trench gap and arc terranes as a hot ophiolite slice.

A potential example is the progressive diminution of the Farallon plate off California. Ophiolite obduction would not be expected as the two plates share a dextral transform boundary. However, the major collision of the Kula/Pacific plate with the Alaskan/Aleutian resulted in the initiation of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath Alaska, with no sign of either obduction or indeed any major manifestation of a ridge being &quot;swallowed&quot;.

===Rear-arc basin===
Dewey and Bird suggest that a common form of ophiolite obduction is related to the closure of rear-arc marginal basins and that, during such closure by subduction, slices of oceanic crust and mantle may be expelled onto adjacent continental forelands and emplaced as ophiolite sheets. In the high heat-flow region of a volcanic arc and rear-arc basin the lithosphere is particularly thin.

This thin lithosphere may preferentially fail along gently dipping thrust surface if a compressional stress is applied to the region. Under these circumstances, a thin sheet of lithosphere may become detached and begin to ride over adjacent lithosphere to finally become emplaced as a thin ophiolite sheet on the adjacent continental foreland. This mechanism is a form of plate convergence where a thin, hot layer of oceanic lithosphere is obducted over cooler and thicker lithosphere.

===Continental collision===
As an ocean is progressively trapped in between two colliding continental lithospheres, the rising wedges of oceanic crust and mantle rise are caught between the continental plates and detach and begin to move up the advancing continental rise. Continued convergence may lead to the overthrusting of the arc-trench gap and eventually overthrusting of the metamorphic plutonic and volcanic rocks of the volcanic arc.

Following total subduction of an oceanic tract, continuing convergence may lead to a further sequence of intra-continental mechanisms of crustal shortening. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the various ocean basins of the Mediterranean region. The Alpide belt is believed to register a complex history of plate interactions during the general convergence of the Eurasian and African plates.

==Examples==
There are few continental plates being obducted under an oceanic plate known today, but in the past it appears to have happened a number of times. Thus there are examples of oceanic crustal rocks and deeper mantle rocks that have been obducted and are now exposed at the surface, worldwide. New Caledonia is one example of recent obduction. The Klamath Mountains of northern California contain several obducted oceanic slabs, most famously the Coast Range Ophiolite. Obducted fragments also are found in the Hajar Mountains of Oman, the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, Newfoundland, New Zealand, the Alps of Europe, the Shetland islands of Unst and Fetlar, Leka island in Norway, and the Blue Ridge Ophiolite in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.

<text>Hwicce () was a kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the kingdom was established in 577, after the Battle of Deorham. After 628, the kingdom became a client or sub-kingdom of Mercia as a result of the Battle of Cirencester.

The &quot;Tribal Hidage&quot; assessed Hwicce at 7,000 hides, an agricultural economy akin to either the kingdom of Essex or Sussex.

The exact boundaries of the kingdom remain uncertain, though it is likely that they coincided with those of the old Diocese of Worcester, founded in 679–680, the early bishops of which bore the title &quot;Episcopus Hwicciorum&quot;. The kingdom would therefore have included Worcestershire except the northwestern tip, Gloucestershire except the Forest of Dean, the southwestern half of Warwickshire, the neighbourhood of Bath north of the Avon, part of west Oxfordshire and small parts of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and north-west Wiltshire.

==Name==
The etymology of the name &quot;the Hwiccians&quot; is uncertain. It is the plural of a masculine &quot;i&quot;-stem. It may be from a tribal name of &quot;the Hwiccians&quot;, or it may be from a clan name.

One etymology comes from the common noun &quot;ark, chest, locker&quot;, in reference to the appearance of the territory as a flat-bottomed valley bordered by the Cotswolds and the Malvern Hills. A second possibility would be a derivation from a given name, &quot;the people of the man called Hwicce&quot;, but no such name has been recorded. Eilert Ekwall connected the name, on linguistic grounds, with that of the , the predecessors of the West Saxons. Also suggested by A. H. Smith is a tribal name that was in origin pejorative, meaning &quot;the cowards&quot;, cognate to &quot;quake&quot;, Old Norse &quot;coward&quot;. It is also likely that &quot;Hwicce&quot; referred to the native tribes living along the banks of the River Severn, in the area of today&#x27;s Worcester, who were weavers using rushes and reeds growing profusely to create baskets. The modern word &quot;wicker&quot;, which is thought to be of Scandinavian origin, describes the type of baskets produced by these early people. However, there are potential objections to many of these possible explanations. For instance, Richard Coates argues that the essence of an ark is that it is closed, rather than open like a valley or plain, that no cognate of or contemporary version of &quot;wicker&quot; is known, and that no full etymological argument to relate to has been advanced.

Stephen Yeates (2008, 2009) has interpreted the name as meaning &quot;cauldron; sacred vessel&quot; and linked to the shape of the Vale of Gloucester and the Romano-British regional cult of a goddess with a bucket or cauldron, identified with a , supposedly associated with West Country legends concerning the Holy Grail. However, his interpretation has been widely dismissed by other academics.

Coates (2013) on the other hand believes that the name has a Brythonic origin, related to the modern Welsh meaning &#x27;excellent&#x27;. The prefix is an emphatic (roughly meaning &#x27;very&#x27;) giving something similar to *. Similar known constructions in Welsh include &#x27;(very) good&#x27;, &#x27;good-natured&#x27;, &#x27;successful&#x27;, &#x27;(very) worthy&#x27; and &#x27;(very) generous&#x27;. Coates notes that the meaning would be &quot;comparable with bombastic British tribal names of the Roman period, such as Ancalites &#x27;the very hard ones&#x27;, Catuvellauni &#x27;the battle-excellent ones&#x27; or Brigantes &#x27;the high ones&#x27;.&quot; Coates does, however, admit that his explanation can also raise objections, not least that is not a recorded and known early or later Welsh word.

The toponym survives in Wychwood in Oxfordshire, Whichford in Warwickshire, Wichenford, Wychbury Hill, Wyche and Droitwich in Worcestershire. (The &#x27;wich&#x27; part of Droitwich is also commonly thought to refer to salt production in that area.) In addition, the local government district of Wychavon derived the first element of its name from the old kingdom.

==History==

The territory of the Hwicce may roughly have corresponded to the Roman &quot;civitas&quot; of the Dobunni. The area appears to have remained largely British in the first century or so after Britain left the Roman Empire, but pagan burials and place names in its north-eastern sector suggest an inflow of Angles along the Warwickshire Avon and perhaps by other routes; they may have exacted tribute from British rulers.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, there was a Battle of Deorham in 577 in which the Gewisse (West Saxons) under Ceawlin killed three British kings and captured Gloucester, Cirencester and Bath. West Saxon occupation of the area did not last long, however, and may have ended as early as 584, the date (according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;) of the battle of Fethanleag, in which Cutha was killed and Ceawlin returned home in anger; and certainly by 603 when, according to Bede, Saint Augustine held a conference with British bishops at Augustine&#x27;s Oak on the border of the Hwicce and the West Saxons.

The Angles strengthened their influence over the area in 628, when (says the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;) the West Saxons fought (the Anglian) Penda of Mercia at Cirencester and afterwards came to terms. Penda had evidently won, but had probably forged an alliance with local leaders, since the former Dobunnic polity did not immediately become part of Mercia but instead became an allied or client kingdom of the Hwicce.

The Hwicce sub-kingdom included a number of distinct tribal groups, including the Husmerae, the Stoppingas and the Weorgoran.

The first probable kings of whom we read were two brothers, Eanhere and Eanfrith. Bede notes that Queen Eafe &quot;had been baptised in her own country, the kingdom of the Hwicce. She was the daughter of Eanfrith, Eanhere&#x27;s brother, both of whom were Christians, as were their people.&quot; From this, we deduce that Eanfrith and Eanhere were of the royal family and that theirs was a Christian kingdom.

It is likely that the Hwicce were converted to Christianity by Celtic Christians rather than by the mission from Pope Gregory I, since Bede was well informed on the latter yet does not mention the conversion of the Hwicce. Though place-names show that Anglo-Saxon settlement was widespread in the territory, the limited spread of pagan burials, along with two &quot;eccles&quot; place-names that invariably identify Roman-British churches, suggests that Christianity survived the influx. There are also probable Christian burials beneath Worcester Cathedral and St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester. So it seems that incoming Anglo-Saxons were absorbed into the existing church. The ruling dynasty of the Hwicce were probably key figures in the process. Perhaps they sprang from intermarriage between Anglian and British leading families.

By a complex chain of reasoning, one can deduce that Eanhere married Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria, and had sons by her named Osric, Oswald and Oshere. Osthryth is recorded as the wife of Æthelred of Mercia. An earlier marriage to Eanhere would explain why Osric and Oswald are described as Æthelred&#x27;s &quot;nepotes&quot; — usually meaning &quot;nephews&quot; or &quot;grandsons&quot; but here probably &quot;stepsons&quot;.

Osric was anxious for the Hwicce to gain their own bishop, but it was Oshere whose influence was seen behind the creation of the see of Worcester in 679–680. Presumably Osric was dead by that time. Tatfrid of Whitby was chosen as the first bishop of the Hwicce, but he died before ordination and was replaced by Bosel. A 12th-century chronicler of Worcester comments that Worcester was selected as the seat of the bishop because it was the capital of the Hwicce.

Oshere was succeeded by his sons Æthelheard, Æthelweard and Æthelric. At the beginning of Offa&#x27;s reign, we find the kingdom ruled by three brothers, named Eanberht, Uhtred and Aldred, the two last of whom lived until about 780. After them, the title of king seems to have been given up. Their successor Æthelmund, who was killed in a campaign against Wessex in 802, is described only as an earl.

The district remained in possession of the rulers of Mercia until the fall of that kingdom. Together with the rest of English Mercia, it submitted to King Alfred about 877–883 under Earl Æthelred, who possibly himself belonged to the Hwicce.

==Kings and ealdormen of the Hwicce==
No contemporary genealogy or list of kings has been preserved, so the following list has been compiled by historians from a variety of primary sources. Some kings of the Hwicce seem to have reigned in tandem for all or part of their reign. This gives rise to an overlap in the dates of reigns given below. Please consult individual biographies for a discussion of the dating of these rulers.

An ealdorman was a high-ranking royal official and prior magistrate of an Anglo-Saxon shire. The term was rendered in Latin as &quot;dux&quot;, &quot;præfectus&quot; or &quot;comes&quot;.
==Other notables of the Hwicce==
Æthelmod granted land to Abbess Beorngyth in October 680 and was probably a member of the royal family.
Osred (&quot;c.&quot; 693), who was a thegn of the Hwicce, has been described by some historians as a king.

<text>Robert Peter Fleming (31 May 1907 – 18 August 1971) was a British adventurer, journalist, soldier and travel writer. He was the elder brother of Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond, and attained the British military rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

==Early life==
Peter Fleming was one of four sons of the barrister and Member of Parliament (MP) Valentine Fleming, who was killed in action during World War I in 1917, having served as MP for Henley from 1910. Fleming was educated at Durnford School and at Eton, where he edited the &quot;Eton College Chronicle&quot;. The Peter Fleming Owl (the English meaning of &quot;Strix&quot;, the name under which he later wrote for &quot;The Spectator&quot;) is still awarded every year to the best contributor to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. He went on from Eton to Christ Church, Oxford, and graduated with a first-class degree in English.

Fleming was a member of the Bullingdon Club during his time at Oxford. On 10 December 1935 he married the actress Celia Johnson (1908–1982), best known for her roles in the films &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;.

==Travels==

===In Brazil===
In April 1932 Fleming replied to an advertisement in the personal columns of &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;Exploring and sporting expedition, under experienced guidance, leaving England June to explore rivers central Brazil, if possible ascertain fate Colonel Percy Fawcett; abundant game, big and small; exceptional fishing; room two more guns; highest references expected and given.&quot; He then joined the expedition, organised by Robert Churchward, to São Paulo, then overland to the rivers Araguaia and Tapirapé, heading towards the last-known position of the Fawcett expedition.

During the inward journey the expedition was riven by increasing disagreements as to its objectives and plans, centred particularly on its local leader, whom Fleming disguised as &quot;Major Pingle&quot; when he wrote about the expedition. Fleming and Roger Pettiward (a school and university friend recruited onto the expedition as a result of a chance encounter with Fleming) led a breakaway group.

This group continued for several days up the Tapirapé to São Domingo, from where Fleming, Pettiward, Neville Priestley and one of the Brazilians hired by the expedition set out to find evidence of Fawcett&#x27;s fate on their own. After acquiring two Tapirapé guides the party began a march to the area where Fawcett was reported to have last been seen. They made slow progress for several days, losing the Indian guides and Neville to foot infection, before admitting defeat.

The expedition&#x27;s return journey was made down the River Araguaia to Belém. It became a closely fought race between Fleming&#x27;s party and &quot;Major Pingle&quot;, the prize being to be the first to report home, and thus to gain the upper hand in the battles over blame and finances that were to come. Fleming&#x27;s party narrowly won. The expedition returned to England in November 1932.

Fleming&#x27;s book about the expedition, &quot;Brazilian Adventure&quot;, has sold well ever since it was first published in 1933, and is still in print.

===In Asia===
Fleming travelled from Moscow to Peking via the Caucasus, the Caspian, Samarkand, Tashkent, the Turksib Railway and the Trans-Siberian Railway to Peking as a special correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;. His experiences were recorded in &quot;One&#x27;s Company&quot; (1934). He then went overland in company of Ella Maillart from China via Tunganistan to India on a journey written up in &quot;News from Tartary&quot; (1936). These two books were combined as &quot;Travels in Tartary: One&#x27;s Company and News from Tartary&quot; (1941). All three volumes were published by Jonathan Cape.

According to Nicolas Clifford, for Fleming China &quot;had the aspect of a comic opera land whose quirks and oddities became grist for the writer, rather than deserving any respect or sympathy in themselves&quot;. In &quot;One&#x27;s Company&quot;, for example, Fleming reports that Beijing was &quot;lacking in charm&quot;, Harbin was a city of &quot;no easily definable character&quot;. Changchun was &quot;entirely characterless&quot;, and Shenyang was &quot;non-descript and suburban&quot;. However, Fleming also provides insights into Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, which helped contemporary readers to understand Chinese resentment and resistance, and the aftermath of the Kumul Rebellion. In the course of these travels Fleming met and interviewed many prominent figures in Central Asia and China, including the Chinese Muslim General Ma Hushan, the Chinese Muslim Taoyin of Kashgar, Ma Shaowu, and Puyi.

Of &quot;Travels in Tartary&quot;, Owen Lattimore remarked that Fleming, who &quot;passes for an easy-going amateur, is in fact an inspired amateur whose quick appreciation, especially of people, and original turn of phrase, echoing P. G. Wodehouse in only a very distant and cultured way, have created a unique kind of travel book&quot;. Lattimore added that it &quot;is only in the political news from Tartary that there is a disappointment&quot;, as, in his view, Fleming offers &quot;a simplified explanation, in terms of Red intrigue and Bolshevik villains, which does not make sense.&quot;

Stuart Stevens retraced Peter Fleming&#x27;s route and wrote his own travel book.

==Second World War==
Just before war was declared, Fleming, then a reserve officer in the Grenadier Guards, was recruited by the War Office research section investigating the potential of irregular warfare (MIR). His initial task was to develop ideas to assist the Chinese guerrillas fighting the Japanese. He served in the Norwegian campaign with the prototype commando units – Independent Companies – but in May 1940 he was tasked with research into the potential use of the new Local Defence Volunteers (later the Home Guard) as guerrilla troops. His ideas were first incorporated into General Thorne&#x27;s XII Corps Observation Unit, forerunner of the GHQ Auxiliary Units. Fleming recruited his brother, Richard, then serving in the Faroe Islands, to provide a core of Lovat Scout instructors to his teams of LDV volunteers.

Meanwhile, Fleming wrote a speculative novel called &quot;The Flying Visit&quot; in which he imagined Adolf Hitler flying to Britain to propose peace with that nation, only to have the United Kingdom let him return in light of the awkward diplomatic quandary he placed the British government in. It proved bizarrely prescient in 1941 when Hitler&#x27;s Deputy, Rudolf Hess, did that exact excursion into Britain and Britain found their new high ranked Nazi prisoner cumbersome for their foreign and propaganda policies.

When Colin Gubbins was appointed to head the new Auxiliary Units, he incorporated many of Peter&#x27;s ideas, which aimed to create secret commando teams of Home Guard in the coastal districts most liable to the risk of invasion. Their role was to launch sabotage raids on the flanks and rear of any invading army, in support of regular troops, but they were never intended as a post-occupation &#x27;resistance&#x27; force, having a life expectancy of only two weeks.

Fleming later served in Greece, but his principal service, from 1942 to the end of the war, was as head of D Division, in charge of military deception operations in Southeast Asia, based in New Delhi, India. He was scheduled to take part in the second Chindit operation, but this was cut short by the premature crash landing of a defective glider. The episode is described in an appendix Fleming contributed to Michael Calvert&#x27;s book on the operation.

Fleming was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1945 Birthday Honours and in 1948 he was awarded the Order of the Cloud and Banner with Special Rosette by the Republic of China.

==Later life and death==
After the war Fleming retired to squiredom at Nettlebed, Oxfordshire and was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Oxfordshire on 31 July 1970.

Fleming died on 18 August 1971 from a heart attack while on a shooting expedition near Glen Coe in Scotland. His body was buried in the graveyard of St Bartholomew’s Church in Nettlebed, where a stained glass window dedicated to his memory was later installed in the church. The gravestone has verses he wrote himself:

He travelled widely in far places; Wrote, and was widely read.Soldiered, saw some of danger&#x27;s faces,Came home to Nettlebed.

The squire lies here, his journeys ended – Dust, and a name on a stone –Content, amid the lands he tended,To keep this rendezvous alone.

==Family==
After the death of his brother Ian in 1964, Fleming served on the board of Glidrose, a company purchased by Ian to hold the literary rights to his writing, particularly the James Bond novels and short stories.

Peter and Celia Fleming remained married until his death in 1971. He was survived by their three children, including Lucy Fleming.

Fleming was the godfather of the British author and journalist Duff Hart-Davis, who wrote &quot;Peter Fleming: A Biography&quot; (published by Jonathan Cape in 1974). Duff&#x27;s father Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, was a close friend of Fleming.

==Legacy==
The Peter Fleming Award, worth £9,000, is given by the Royal Geographical Society for a &quot;research project that seeks to advance geographical science&quot;.

Fleming&#x27;s book about the British military expedition to Tibet in 1903 to 1904 is credited in the Chinese film &quot;Red River Valley&quot; (1997).

==Quotations==
*&quot;São Paulo is like Reading, only much farther away.&quot; – &quot;Brazilian Adventure&quot;
*&quot;Public opinion in England is sharply divided on the subject of Russia. On the one hand you have the crusty majority, who believe it to be a hell on earth; on the other you have the half-baked minority who believe it to be a terrestrial paradise in the making. Both cling to their opinions with the tenacity, respectively, of the die-hard and the fanatic. Both are hopelessly wrong.&quot; – &quot;One&#x27;s Company&quot;
*The recorded history of Chinese civilisation covers a period of four thousand years.
:The Population of China is estimated at 450 million.
:China is larger than Europe.
:The author of this book is twenty-six years old.
:He has spent, altogether, about seven months in China.
:He does not speak Chinese.

<doc id="145830" wikidata="Q348955" url="?curid=145830" title="Edwin of Northumbria">
<text>Edwin (; c. 586 – 12 October 632/633), also known as Eadwine or Æduinus, was the King of Deira and Bernicia – which later became known as Northumbria – from about 616 until his death. He was the second monarch to rule both of these northern English kingdoms and the first to convert to Christianity. After he fell in battle, he was venerated as a saint.

Edwin was the son of Ælle, the first known king of Deira, and likely had at least two siblings. His sister Acha was married to Æthelfrith, king of neighbouring Bernicia. Edwin was forced into exile when Æthelfrith conquered Deira. His travels took him to the court of Rædwald of East Anglia, who defeated Æthelfrith in 616, allowing Edwin to ascend the thrones of Bernicia and Deira. After the death of his patron Rædwald around 624, Edwin became the most powerful ruler in Britain. Bede the Venerable includes him in his list of kings who exercised imperium over other Anglo-Saxon monarchs, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; gives him the title &quot;bretwalda&quot;, or &quot;ruler of Britain&quot;.

In 627, Edwin was baptised under the influence of his wife, Æthelburh of Kent, and the Roman missionary Paulinus, who became the first Bishop of York. After reigning for seventeen years, Edwin was defeated and killed in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase by the combined armies of his supposed foster-brother Cadwallon ap Cadfan and the pagan Penda of Mercia. After his death, Bernicia and Deira were again separated under two pagan kings. Their reunification was accomplished by Oswald, a son Æthelfrith, who defeated and killed Cadwallon and united Northumbria once more.

== Early life and exile ==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reported that on Ælle&#x27;s death a certain &quot;Æthelric&quot; assumed power. The exact identity of Æthelric is unclear. He may have been a brother of Ælle, an elder brother of Edwin, an otherwise unknown Deiran noble, or the father of Æthelfrith. Æthelfrith himself appears to have been king of &quot;Northumbria&quot;—both Deira and Bernicia—by no later than 604. An otherwise unknown sibling fathered Hereric, who in turn fathered Abbess Hilda of Whitby and Hereswith, wife to Æthelric, the brother of king Anna of East Anglia. During the reign of Æthelfrith, Edwin was an exile. The location of his early exile as a child is not known, but late traditions, reported by Reginald of Durham and Geoffrey of Monmouth, place Edwin in the kingdom of Gwynedd, fostered by king Cadfan ap Iago, so allowing biblical parallels to be drawn from the struggle between Edwin and his supposed foster-brother Cadwallon. By the 610s, he was certainly in Mercia under the protection of king Cearl, whose daughter, Cwenburg, he married.

By around 616, Edwin was in East Anglia under the protection of king Rædwald. Bede reports that Æthelfrith tried to have Rædwald murder his unwanted rival, and that Rædwald intended to do so until his wife persuaded him otherwise with Divine prompting. Æthelfrith faced Rædwald in the Battle of the River Idle in 616, and Æthelfrith was defeated; Rædwald installed Edwin as king of Northumbria. Rædwald&#x27;s son Rægenhere may have been killed at this battle, but the exact date or manner of Rædwald&#x27;s death are not known. He likely died between the years 616–627, and the efficacy of Edwin&#x27;s kingship ostensibly depended greatly on his fealty to Rædwald.

Edwin was installed as king of Northumbria, effectively confirming Rædwald as &quot;bretwalda&quot;: Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons went into exile in Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata and Pictland. That Edwin was able to take power not only in his native Deira but also in Bernicia may have been due to his support from Rædwald, to whom he may have remained subject during the early part of his reign. Edwin&#x27;s reign marks an interruption of the otherwise consistent domination of Northumbria by the Bernicians and has been seen as &quot;contrary to the prevailing tendency&quot;.

== As king ==
With the death of Æthelfrith, and of the powerful Æthelberht of Kent the same year, Rædwald and his client Edwin were well placed to dominate England, and indeed Rædwald did so until his death a decade later. Edwin expelled Ceretic from the minor British kingdom of Elmet in either 616 or 626. Elmet had probably been subject to Mercia and then to Edwin. 

Edwin and Eadbald of Kent were allies at this time, and Edwin arranged to marry Eadbald&#x27;s sister Æthelburg. Bede notes that Eadbald would agree to marry his sister to Edwin only if he converted to Christianity. The marriage of Eadbald&#x27;s Merovingian mother Bertha had resulted in the conversion of Kent and Æthelburg&#x27;s would do the same in Northumbria.

Edwin&#x27;s expansion to the west may have begun early in his reign. There is firm evidence of a war waged in the early 620s between Edwin and Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi, king of the Ulaid in Ireland. A lost poem is known to have existed recounting Fiachnae&#x27;s campaigns against the Saxons, and the Irish annals report the siege, or the storming, of Bamburgh in Bernicia in 623–624. This should presumably be placed in the context of Edwin&#x27;s designs on the Isle of Man, a target of Ulaid ambitions. Fiachnae&#x27;s death in 626, at the hands of his namesake, Fiachnae mac Demmáin of the Dál Fiatach, and the second Fiachnae&#x27;s death a year later in battle against the Dál Riata probably eased the way for Edwin&#x27;s conquests in the Irish sea province.

The routine of kingship in Edwin&#x27;s time involved regular, probably annual, wars with neighbours to obtain tribute, submission, and slaves. By Edwin&#x27;s death, it is likely that these annual wars, unreported in the main, had extended the Northumbrian kingdoms from the Humber and the Mersey north to the Southern Uplands and the Cheviots.

The royal household moved regularly from one royal vill to the next, consuming the food renders given in tribute and the produce of the royal estates, dispensing justice, and ensuring that royal authority remained visible throughout the land. The royal sites in Edwin&#x27;s time included Yeavering in Bernicia, where traces of a timber amphitheatre have been found. This &quot;Roman&quot; feature makes Bede&#x27;s claim that Edwin was preceded by a standard-bearer carrying a &quot;tufa&quot; (&quot;OE&quot; &quot;thuuf&quot;, this may have been a winged globe) appear to be more than antiquarian curiosity, although whether the model for this practice was Roman or Frankish is unknown. Other royal sites included &quot;Campodunum&quot; in Elmet (perhaps Barwick), Sancton in Deira, and Goodmanham, the site where the pagan high priest Coifi destroyed the idols according to Bede. Edwin&#x27;s realm included the former Roman cities of York and Carlisle, and both appear to have been of some importance in the 7th century, although it is not clear whether urban life continued in this period.

== Conversion to Christianity ==
The account of Edwin&#x27;s conversion offered by Bede turns on two events. The first, during Edwin&#x27;s exile, tells how Edwin&#x27;s life was saved by Paulinus of York. The second, following his marriage to Æthelburg, was the attempted assassination at York, at Easter 626, by an agent of Cwichelm of Wessex. Apart from these events, the general character of Bede&#x27;s account is one of an indecisive king, unwilling to take risks, unable to decide whether to convert or not.

Along with these events, the influence of Edwin&#x27;s half-Merovingian Queen cannot be ignored, and the letters which Bede reproduces, sent by Pope Boniface V to Edwin and Æthelburg, are unlikely to have been unique. Given that Kent was under Frankish influence, while Bede sees the mission as being &quot;Roman&quot; in origin, the Franks were equally interested in converting their fellow Germans and in extending their power and influence. Bede recounts Edwin&#x27;s baptism, and that of his chief men, on 12 April 627. Edwin&#x27;s zeal, so Bede says, led to Rædwald&#x27;s son Eorpwald also converting.

Bede&#x27;s account of the conversion is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counsellors what they think of the new doctrine. Edwin&#x27;s priest Coifi responds that they may be worthwhile; after all, he says, no one has been more respectful of and devoted to their gods than he, and he has seen no benefits from his dedication to them. Then, an unnamed counsellor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshipped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols, declaring &quot;I will do this myself, for now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably than I can set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Coifi &quot;formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion.&quot; Armed with both a sword and spear, Coifi rides Edwin&#x27;s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin&#x27;s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Coifi &quot;cast a spear into it and profaned it.&quot;

In an article titled &quot;How Coifi Pierced Christ’s Side&quot;, Julia Barrow examines Bede&#x27;s Latinate text and pays particular attention to the passage concerning Coifi&#x27;s attack upon the temple. Barrow notes that Bede&#x27;s use of &quot;lancea&quot; was &quot;not the word medieval writers normally used for spear&quot;, while “&quot;hasta&quot; was the usual choice.&quot; Barrow goes on to claim that &quot;lancea&quot; was likely used by Bede as a reference to the details of the crucifixion of Christ provided in the vulgate book of John, thus Coifi&#x27;s desecration of the shrine is to be understood &quot;as an inversion of the piercing of the temple of Christ’s body.&quot; All of these details support an understanding that Bede had great &quot;warmth and admiration&quot; for Edwin.

The brief speech by the unnamed counsellor, a nobleman, has attracted much attention; suggesting the &quot;wisdom and hopefulness of the Christian message&quot;, it has inspired poets such as William Wordsworth and was called &quot;the most poetic simile in Bede&quot;:

The present life man, O king, seems to me, in comparison with that time which is unknown to us, like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you sit at supper in winter amid your officers and ministers, with a good fire in the midst whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad; the sparrow, I say, flying in at one door and immediately out another, whilst he is within is safe from the wintry but after a short space of fair weather he immediately vanishes out of your sight into the dark winter from which he has emerged. So this life of man appears for a short space but of what went before or what is to follow we are ignorant. If, therefore, this new doctrine contains something more certain, it seems justly to deserve to be followed. 

Noteworthy is Bede&#x27;s summation of the nature of Edwin&#x27;s reign as King of Northumbria:

“It is told that at the time there was so much peace in Britannia, that whenever King Edwin’s power extended, as is said proverbially right up to today, even if a woman with a recently born child wanted to walk across the whole island, from sea to sea, she could do so without anyone harming her.”

Kershaw indicates that “Bede’s decision to couch Edwin’s peace in proverbial terms offers ...a chilling insight into the levels of lawlessness accepted in eighth-century England”. Furthermore, a definition of “peace” is to be understood as “freedom from robbery, rape, or violence; security to travel at will and to literally ‘go in peace.’”

Edwin&#x27;s conversion and Eorpwald&#x27;s were reversed by their successors, and in the case of Northumbria the Roman Paulinus appears to have had very little impact. Indeed, by expelling British clergy from Elmet and elsewhere in Edwin&#x27;s realm, Paulinus may have weakened the Church rather than strengthening it. Very few Roman clergy were present in Paulinus&#x27;s time, only James the Deacon being known, so that the &quot;conversion&quot; can have been only superficial, extending little beyond the royal court. Paulinus&#x27;s decision to flee Northumbria at Edwin&#x27;s death, unlike his acolyte James who remained in Northumbria for many years afterwards until his death, suggests that the conversion was not popular, and the senior Italian cleric unloved.

== As overlord ==
The first challenge to Edwin came soon after his marriage-alliance with Kent, concluded at Canterbury in the summer of 625. By offering his protection to lesser kings, such as the king of Wight, Edwin thwarted the ambitions of Cwichelm of Wessex. Cwichelm&#x27;s response was to send an assassin, as noted already. Edwin did not immediately respond to this insult, suggesting either that he felt unable to do so, or that Bede&#x27;s portrayal of him as a rather indecisive ruler is accurate. Following the failed assassination, as noted, Edwin committed himself to Christianity provided only that he was victorious against Cwichelm.

From about 627 onwards, Edwin was the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The &quot;imperium&quot;, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated with the idea of a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin&#x27;s overlordship, and failure would diminish it.

Edwin&#x27;s supposed foster-brother Cadwallon ap Cadfan enters the record circa 629, but Cadwallon was defeated and either submitted to Edwin&#x27;s authority or went into exile. With the defeat of Cadwallon, Edwin&#x27;s authority appears to have been unchallenged for a number of years, until Penda of Mercia and Cadwallon rose against him in 632–633.

Edwin faced Penda and Cadwallon at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in the autumn of 632 or 633 and was defeated and killed. For a time his body was (allegedly) hidden in Sherwood Forest at a location that became the village of Edwinstowe (trans. Edwin&#x27;s resting place), his head being eventually buried at York and the rest of his body at Whitby. Of his two grown sons by Cwenburh of Mercia, Osfrith died at Hatfield, and Eadfrith was captured by Penda and killed some time afterwards.

After his death, Edwin&#x27;s Queen Æthelburg, along with Paulinus, returned to Kent, taking her son Uscfrea, daughter Eanfled, and Osfrith&#x27;s son Yffi into exile with her. Uscfrea and Yffi were sent to the court of Æthelburg&#x27;s kinsman Dagobert I, king of the Franks, but died soon afterwards. Eanfled, however, lived to marry her first cousin, King Oswiu, son of Acha and Æthelfrith.

== Death and legacy ==

Edwin&#x27;s realm was divided at his death. He was succeeded by Osric, son of Edwin&#x27;s paternal uncle Ælfric, in Deira, and by Eanfrith, son of Æthelfrith and Edwin&#x27;s sister Acha, in Bernicia. Both reverted to paganism, and both were killed by Cadwallon; eventually Eanfrith&#x27;s brother Oswald defeated and killed Cadwallon and united Northumbria once more.

After his death, Edwin came to be venerated as a saint by some, although his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, who was killed in 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede&#x27;s treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.

Edwin&#x27;s renown comes largely from his treatment at some length by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be something less than a key figure in Britain during the first half of the 7th century. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin&#x27;s reign lay in his failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.

<text>Æthelfrith (died c. 616) was King of Bernicia from c. 593 until his death around 616 AD at the Battle of the River Idle. He became the first Bernician king to also rule the neighboring land of Deira, giving him an important place in the development and the unification of the later kingdom of Northumbria. He was especially notable for his successes against the Britons and his victory over the Gaels of Dál Riata. Although he was defeated and killed in battle and replaced by a dynastic rival, his line was eventually restored to power in the 630s.

== Background ==
Æthelfrith, son of Æthelric and grandson of Ida, apparently succeeded Hussa as king of the Bernicians around the year 592 or 593; Æthelfrith&#x27;s accession may have involved dynastic rivalry and the exile of Hussa&#x27;s relatives. The genealogies attached to some manuscripts of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; say that Æthelfrith ruled Bernicia for twelve years and ruled Deira for another twelve years, which can be taken to mean that he ruled in Bernicia alone from about 592 to 604, at which point he also came to the throne of Deira. His predecessors are obscure; Æthelfrith is the earliest Bernician ruler about whom any significant details are known. The 20th-century historian Frank Stenton wrote that &quot;the continuous history of Northumbria, and indeed of England, begins with the reign of Æthelfrith&quot;, and that &quot;he was the real founder of the historic Northumbrian kingdom, and he was remembered as the first great leader who had arisen among the northern Angles.&quot;

== Conquests ==
Bede tells of Æthelfrith&#x27;s great successes over the Britons, while also noting his paganism (the conversion of Northumbria did not begin until a decade after his death): he &quot;ravaged the Britons more than all the great men of the English, insomuch that he might be compared to Saul, once king of the Israelites, excepting only this, that he was ignorant of the true religion. For he conquered more territories from the Britons, either making them tributary, or driving the inhabitants clean out, and planting English in their places, than any other king or tribune.&quot; It may have been Æthelfrith who destroyed the British army at the Battle of Catraeth (Catterick, c. 600); the battle is described in the early poem Y Gododdin. The Britons called him &quot;Flesaur&quot;, or &quot;the twister&quot;. It was under Æthelfrith that Bernicia&#x27;s boundaries pushed significantly inland from the coast, and penetrated further into British territory.

Áedán mac Gabráin, the king of Dál Riata (to the northwest of Bernicia), was alarmed by Æthelfrith&#x27;s successes, and in 603 he led &quot;an immense and mighty army&quot; against him. Although Æthelfrith commanded an inferior force, according to Bede, he won a crushing victory at a place called Degsastan; most of Áedán&#x27;s army was killed, and Áedán himself fled. Bede says that Æthelfrith&#x27;s victory was so great that the Irish kings in Britain would not make war on the English again, right up to Bede&#x27;s own time. The battle appears to have been costly for Æthelfrith as well, however; Bede says that Æthelfrith&#x27;s brother Theodbald was killed, &quot;with almost all the forces he commanded&quot;. The appearance of Hering, son of Hussa, Æthelfrith&#x27;s predecessor, on the side of the invaders seems to indicate dynastic rivalry among the Bernicians. Æthelfrith may have come to terms with the rulers of Dál Riata after this, judging from the fact that his subsequent known military campaigns took place in other parts of Britain; that his sons were later able to take refuge in Dál Riata after Æthelfrith&#x27;s own death in battle may be significant.

Æthelfrith gained control of Deira around 604; the circumstances of this are unknown. That he gained Deira through conquest is suggested by the exile of Edwin, son of the former king Ælla, and Hereric, Edwin&#x27;s nephew, who were both notable members of the Deiran royal line; the short five-year reign of Æthelric of Deira, who ruled immediately prior to Æthelfrith&#x27;s acquisition of Deira, may also indicate conquest. On the other hand, D. P. Kirby suggested that Æthelfrith&#x27;s rule of both kingdoms may have represented &quot;a formalization of an existing relationship&quot; of cooperation between the two. Kirby also pointed out that Edwin did not necessarily go into exile immediately, and considered it likely that Æthelfrith&#x27;s hostility towards him &quot;manifested itself only by degrees&quot;. Edwin, apparently seeking safety from Æthelfrith, seems to have travelled between many different kingdoms during his period of exile. He may have spent time during his exile in the British kingdom of Gwynedd, and it seems clear that he spent time in Mercia, because he married a daughter of king Cearl. Ultimately, he took refuge in East Anglia, where his presence precipitated the events that caused Æthelfrith&#x27;s downfall.

It was also around 604 that Æthelfrith&#x27;s son Oswald was born. Oswald&#x27;s mother was Acha of Deira, daughter of Ælla, and thus Edwin&#x27;s sister. Although Bede does not explicitly say Æthelfrith married Acha, it is thought that he did so; he may have married her prior to taking power in Deira, in which case the marriage may have facilitated it, or he may have done so afterwards in order to consolidate his position there.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; says that Æthelfrith gave the town of &quot;Din Guaire&quot; to his wife Bebba, after whom it was named Bamburgh; Bede also says that Bamburgh was named after a former queen named Bebba, although he does not mention Æthelfrith. It has been suggested that she &quot;was probably Æthelfrith&#x27;s first and most important wife&quot;.

Later in his reign, probably between 613 and 616, Æthelfrith attacked the Kingdom of Powys and defeated its army in a battle at Chester, in which the Powysian king Selyf Sarffgadau was killed, along with another king called Cetula, who was probably Cadwal Crysban of Rhôs. He also massacred the monks of Bangor-Is-Coed who were assembled to aid the Britons by their prayers. Bede says that he decided to attack them because, although they were not armed, they were opposing him through their prayers. The number of dead monks was said to be about 1200, with only fifty escaping. It has been suggested that Æthelfrith may have done this for tactical reasons, to catch the Britons by surprise and force them to change their plans in order to protect the monks. After first killing the monks, Æthelfrith prevailed over the enemy army, although Bede notes that Æthelfrith&#x27;s own forces suffered considerable loss. Æthelfrith&#x27;s victory at Chester has been seen as having great strategic importance, as it may have resulted in the separation of the Britons between those in Wales and those to the north; however, Stenton noted that Bede was mainly concerned with the massacre of the monks and does not indicate that he regarded the battle as a historical &quot;turning-point&quot;. John T. Koch says that the older view that the battle cut the two British areas off from each other is now &quot;generally understood&quot; to be outdated, as Æthelfrith died soon after, and there is &quot;almost no archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement within the pagan period in Cheshire or Lancashire&quot;, and in any case the sea would have been the primary means of communication.

== Rivals ==
The Deiran exile Hereric was poisoned while at the court of Ceretic, king of Elmet; Æthelfrith may have been responsible for this killing. Edwin ended up in East Anglia, under the protection of its king, Rædwald. Æthelfrith sent messengers to bribe Rædwald with &quot;a great sum of money&quot; into killing Edwin; Bede reports that his first message had no effect, but Æthelfrith sent more messengers and threatened war if Rædwald did not comply (bribes and threats of this kind may have previously been used to accomplish Hereric&#x27;s killing). Rædwald eventually agreed to kill Edwin or hand him over to Æthelfrith&#x27;s messengers, but was reportedly dissuaded from this by his wife, who said that such a thing was unworthy of his honour.

Instead, Rædwald raised an army and marched against Æthelfrith, and around 616 Æthelfrith was defeated and killed at the Battle of the River Idle (on the east side of the River Idle) by an army under Rædwald; Bede says that Æthelfrith had the inferior army, because Rædwald had not given him time to bring all his forces together. While presented by Bede as being fought simply over the issue of Edwin, this war may have actually involved questions of power and territory between the two rulers. Following Æthelfrith&#x27;s death, Edwin became king not just of Deira but of Bernicia as well; Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons Eanfrith, Oswald, and Oswiu fled to the north. Thus Æthelfrith&#x27;s death in battle has been seen as causing &quot;a near total revolution in the politics of what is now northern England&quot;. After Edwin was killed in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, Eanfrith temporarily regained power in Bernicia, and subsequently Oswald restored the Bernician line of Æthelfrith to power in both Bernicia and Deira. After this point, Æthelfrith&#x27;s descendants continued to rule until the first part of the eighth century.

== Family ==
Æthelfrith, according to the 9th-century Anglo-Saxon genealogies (of doubtful historicity) was the son of Æthelric and grandson of Ida.

Æthelfrith married Acha of Deira, daughter of Ælla of Deira. They had eight children:
* Eanfrith of Bernicia (590–634)
* Oswald of Northumbria (c. 604 – 5 August 642)
* Oswiu of Northumbria (c. 612 – 15 February 670)
* Oswudu of Northumbria
* Oslac of Northumbria
* Oslaf of Northumbria
* Offa of Northumbria
* Æbba of Northumbria

<text>Æthelweard (also Ethelward; d. ) was an ealdorman and the author of a Latin version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; known as the &quot;Chronicon Æthelweardi&quot;. He was a kinsman of the royal family, being a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon King Æthelred I of Wessex, the elder brother of Alfred the Great.

==Career==
Æthelweard first witnessed charters as a thegn after the accession of Eadwig in 955, probably because he was the brother of the king&#x27;s wife, Ælfgifu, although the relationship is unproven. The marriage was annulled on the grounds of consanguinity, and Æthelweard&#x27;s position was threatened when Eadwig died in 959 and was succeeded by his half-brother Edgar, who was hostile to the faction associated with Eadwig. Æthelweard survived, although he was not appointed to the position of ealdorman until after Edgar&#x27;s death. In the view of Shashi Jayakumar, &quot;One receives the impression that Æthelweard played his cards right in Edgar&#x27;s reign, perhaps by treading warily and displaying the same maddening discretion that one finds in his &quot;Chronicon&quot;.

Æthelweard probably became ealdorman of south-west England after Edgar&#x27;s death in 975, although there is evidence, described by Simon Keynes as &quot;rather poor&quot;, that he was appointed in 973. He was accorded primacy among the ealdormen after 993. He continued to witness until 998, about which time his death may have taken place. Æthelweard&#x27;s ealdormanry was the Western Provinces, probably the southwest peninsula. His brother Ælfweard, a royal &quot;discthegn&quot;, or household official, continued to sign as &quot;minister&quot; until 986.

In 991 Æthelweard was associated with archbishop Sigeric in the conclusion of a peace with the victorious Danes from Maldon, and in 994 he was sent with Bishop Ælfheah of Winchester to make peace with Olaf Tryggvason at Andover.

Æthelweard was the friend and patron of Ælfric of Eynsham, who in the preface to his Old English &quot;Lives&quot; of saints, addressed Æthelweard and his son Æthelmær.

==Family==
In the introduction to his Latin Chronicle Æthelweard claims to descend from King Æthelred, while in Book IV he calls Æthelred his &quot;atavus&quot;, then uses the same term to describe the relationship between the chronicle&#x27;s recipient, Mathilde, Abbess of Essen, and her great-great-grandfather, King Alfred. According to Patrick Wormald, Æthelweard may have meant that Æthelred was his great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, great-great-great-grandfather, or merely ancestor, but Sean Miller specifies great-great-grandfather. In 957 King Eadwig, the great-grandson of King Æthelred I&#x27;s brother, Alfred the Great, was obliged to divorce Æthelweard&#x27;s likely sister Ælfgifu on the grounds of consanguinity.

It has been postulated that Æthelweard and his siblings Ælfweard, Ælfgifu and Ælfwaru were the children of Eadric, ealdorman of Hampshire. This identification rests on Ælfgifu&#x27;s possession of the estate of Risborough, which had belonged to Eadric&#x27;s mother, Æthelgyth, the wife of ealdorman Æthelfrith of Mercia.

One possible construction is that his putative grandfather Æthelfrith was the grandson of King Æthelred I through his son Æthelhelm. This royal connection would go some way to explaining the enormous prestige enjoyed by Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons.

Assuming that the identification of Æthelweard as the brother of Ælfgifu is correct, his mother was the Æthelgifu whose company Eadwig enjoyed along with her daughter whilst escaping his coronation. Ælfgifu left a bequest to an Æthelflaed, who was either Æthelweard&#x27;s wife or his sister-in-law.

Æthelweard was father of Æthelmær the Stout, who was ealdorman of the Western provinces towards the end of Æthelred II&#x27;s reign. Æthelmær was the father of Æthelnoth, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1020, and was later regarded as a saint, and of the Æthelweard executed by King Cnut in 1017. Æthelmær has been speculatively identified with the Agelmær named by John of Worcester as brother of Eadric Streona and father of Wulfnoth Cild, who was father of Godwin, Earl of Wessex and grandfather of King Harold II, though the Worcester chronicler makes this Agelmær son of Agelric rather than Æthelweard and the pedigree as a whole has problematic chronology.

==Works==
After 975 and probably before 983, Æthelweard wrote the &quot;Chronicon&quot;, a Latin translation of a lost version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, including material not found in surviving Old English versions. Æthelweard wrote his work at the request of his relative Mathilde, abbess of the Essen Abbey and granddaughter of emperor Otto I and Eadgyth of Wessex. The text only survives in a single copy now in the British Library, which was badly damaged in the Cotton Library fire in 1731, but it had been printed by Henry Savile in 1596. Mathilde probably rewarded him with a copy of Vegetius&#x27; work &quot;De Re Militari&quot; which was written in Essen and has long been in England.

The &quot;Chronicon&quot; was composed in the &quot;hermeneutic&quot; style almost universally adopted by English scholars writing in Latin in the tenth century. Michael Lapidge defines it as &quot;a style whose most striking feature is the ostentatious parade of unusual, often very arcane and apparently learned vocabulary.&quot; The twelfth century historian William of Malmesbury, writing at a time when the style had come to be seen as barbarous, wrote about him &quot;... of Elward, a noble and illustrious character, who attempted to arrange these chronicles in Latin, and whose intention I could applaud if his language did not disgust me, it would be better to be silent&quot;.

<doc id="145837" wikidata="Q243419" url="?curid=145837" title="Julian Huxley">
<text>Sir Julian Sorell Huxley (22 June 1887 – 14 February 1975) was an English evolutionary biologist, eugenicist and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth-century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935–1942), the first director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund, the president of the British Eugenics Society (1959–1962), and the first president of the British Humanist Association.

Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. He directed an Oscar-winning wildlife film. He was awarded UNESCO&#x27;s Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science in 1953, the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956, and the Darwin–Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958. He was also knighted in the 1958 New Year Honours, a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1956 he received a Special Award from the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood – World Population.

== Life ==
=== Personal life ===
Huxley came from the Huxley family on his father&#x27;s side and the Arnold family on his mother&#x27;s. His great-grandfather was Thomas Arnold of Rugby School, his great-uncle Matthew Arnold, and his aunt, Mrs Humphry Ward. His grandfather Thomas Henry Huxley was raised Anglican but eventually became an advocate of Agnosticism, a word he coined. Thomas was also a biologist, forceful supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution.

Huxley&#x27;s father was writer and editor Leonard Huxley and his mother was Julia Arnold, a graduate of Somerville College, Oxford, who had gained a First in English Literature there in 1882. Julia and Leonard married in 1885 and they had four children: Margaret (1899–1981), the novelist Aldous, Trevenen and Julian.

Huxley was born on 22 June 1887, at the London house of his aunt. His mother opened a school in Compton, Guildford in 1902 and died in 1908, when he was 21. In 1912, his father married Rosalind Bruce, who was the same age as Julian, and he later acquired half-brothers Andrew Huxley and David Huxley.

In 1911, Huxley became informally engaged to Kathleen Fordham, whom he had met some years earlier when she was a pupil at Prior&#x27;s Field, Compton, the school his mother had founded and run. During 1913 the relationship broke down and Huxley had a nervous breakdown which a biographer described as caused by &#x27;conflict between desire and guilt&#x27;.

In the first months of 1914 Huxley had severe depression and lived for some weeks at The Hermitage, a small private nursing home. In August 1914 while Huxley was in Scotland, his brother Trevenen also had a nervous breakdown and stayed in the same nursing home. Trevenen was worried about how he had treated one of his women friends and committed suicide whilst there.

In 1919, Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994) a French Swiss woman whom he had met while she was employed as a governess at Garsington Manor, the country house of Lady Ottoline Morrell. Huxley was later unfaithful to Baillot and told her that he wanted an open marriage. One of his affairs was with the poet May Sarton who in turn fell in love with Baillot and had a brief affair with her as well.

Huxley described himself in print as suffering from manic depression, and his wife&#x27;s autobiography suggests that Julian Huxley suffered from a bipolar disorder. He relied on his wife to provide moral and practical support throughout his life.

Sir Julian and Lady Juliette Huxley had two sons: Anthony Huxley (1920–1992) and Francis Huxley (1923–2016), who both became scientists.

His ashes are buried with his wife, son Anthony, parents and brother at the Huxley family grave in Watts Cemetery, Compton.

=== Early career ===
Huxley grew up at the family home in Shackleford, Surrey, England, where he showed an early interest in nature, as he was given lessons by his grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley. When he heard his grandfather talking at dinner about the lack of parental care in fish, Julian piped up with &quot;What about the stickleback, Gran&#x27;pater?&quot;. His grandfather also took him to visit Joseph Dalton Hooker at Kew. At the age of thirteen Huxley attended Eton College as a King&#x27;s Scholar, and continued to develop scientific interests; his grandfather had influenced the school to build science laboratories much earlier. At Eton he developed an interest in ornithology, guided by science master W. D. &quot;Piggy&quot; Hill. &quot;Piggy was a genius as a teacher ... I have always been grateful to him.&quot; In 1905 Huxley won a scholarship in Zoology to Balliol College, Oxford and took up the place in 1906 after spending the summer in Germany. He developed a particular interest in embryology and protozoa and developed a friendship with the ornithologist William Warde Fowler. In the autumn term of his final year, 1908, his mother died from cancer at the age of 46. In his final year he won the Newdigate Prize for his poem &quot;Holyrood&quot;. In 1909 he graduated with first-class honours, and spent that July at the international gathering for the centenary of Darwin&#x27;s birth, held at the University of Cambridge.

Huxley was awarded a scholarship to spend a year at the Naples Marine Biological Station, where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at the University of Oxford, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds, such as the common redshank (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as &#x27;penguin dance&#x27;, &#x27;plesiosaurus race&#x27; etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.

In 1912 Huxley was asked by Edgar Odell Lovett to set up the Department of Biology at the newly created Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, which he accepted, planning to start the following year. Huxley made an exploratory trip to the United States in September 1912, visiting a number of leading universities as well as the Rice Institute. At T. H. Morgan&#x27;s fly lab (Columbia University) he invited H. J. Muller to join him at Rice. Muller agreed to be his deputy, hurried to complete his PhD and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915–1916 academic year. At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued &quot;Drosophila&quot; lab work.

Before taking up the post of assistant professor at the Rice Institute, Huxley spent a year in Germany preparing for his demanding new job. Working in a laboratory just months before the outbreak of World War I, Huxley overheard fellow academics comment on a passing aircraft, &quot;It will not be long before those planes are flying over England.&quot;

One pleasure of Huxley&#x27;s life in Texas was the sight of his first hummingbird, though his visit to Edward Avery McIlhenny&#x27;s estate on Avery Island in Louisiana was more significant. The McIlhennys and their Avery cousins owned the entire island, and the McIlhenny branch used it to produce their famous Tabasco sauce. Birds were one of McIlhenny&#x27;s passions, however, and around 1895 he had set up a private sanctuary on the island, called Bird City. There Huxley found egrets, herons and bitterns. These water birds, like the grebes, exhibit mutual courtship, with the pairs displaying to each other, and with secondary sexual characteristics equally developed in both sexes.

In September 1916 Huxley returned to England from Texas to assist in the war effort. He was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps on 25 May 1917, and was transferred to the General List, working in the British Army Intelligence Corps from 26 January 1918, first in Sussex, and then in northern Italy. He was advanced in grade within the Intelligence Corps on 3 May 1918, relinquished his intelligence appointment on 10 January 1919 and was demobilised five days later, retaining his rank. After the war he became a Fellow at New College, Oxford, and was made Senior Demonstrator in the University Department of Zoology. In fact, Huxley took the place of his old tutor Geoffrey Smith, who had been killed in the battle of the Somme on the Western Front. The ecological geneticist E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.

He participated in the 1921 Oxford University Spitsbergen expedition as one of the main scientists, together with Alexander Carr-Saunders. In 1925 Huxley moved to King&#x27;s College London as Professor of Zoology, but in 1927, to the amazement of his colleagues and on the prodding of H. G. Wells whom he had promised 1,000 words a day, he resigned his chair to work full-time with Wells and his son G. P. Wells on &quot;The Science of Life&quot; (see below). For some time Huxley retained his room at King&#x27;s College, continuing as Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department, and from 1927 to 1931 he was also Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution, where he gave an annual lectures series, but this marked the end of his life as a university academic.

In 1929, after finishing work on &quot;The Science of Life&quot;, Huxley visited East Africa to advise the Colonial Office on education in British East Africa (for the most part Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika). He discovered that the wildlife on the Serengeti plain was almost undisturbed because the tsetse fly (the vector for the trypanosome parasite which causes sleeping sickness in humans) prevented human settlement there. He tells about these experiences in &quot;Africa view&quot; (1931), and so does his wife. She reveals that he fell in love with an 18-year-old American girl on board ship (when Juliette was not present), and then presented Juliette with his ideas for an open marriage: &quot;What Julian really wanted was ... a definite freedom from the conventional bonds of marriage.&quot; The couple separated for a while; Julian travelled to the US, hoping to land a suitable appointment and, in due course, to marry Miss Weldmeier. He left no account of what transpired, but he was evidently not successful, and returned to England to resume his marriage in 1931. For the next couple of years Huxley still angled for an appointment in the US, without success.

=== Mid career ===
As the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the USSR at the invitation of Intourist, where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank Political and Economic Planning.

In the 1930s Huxley visited Kenya and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of national parks.

In 1933, he was one of eleven people involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), an organisation for the study of birds in the British Isles. From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey&#x27;s African Survey.

In 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said &quot;He was impatient... and lacked tact&quot;. He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows&#x27; Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley&#x27;s mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.

In 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join World War II: a few weeks later came the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society—&quot;a curious assemblage... of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic&quot;—uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post &quot;to save expenses&quot;. Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the council&#x27;s action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way.

In 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The commission&#x27;s remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55.

In 1945, Huxley proposed to melt the polar ice caps by igniting atomic bombs to moderate the world climate in the northern hemisphere, and permit shipping across the top of the world.

=== Later career ===

Huxley, a lifelong internationalist with a concern for education, got involved in the creation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and became the organization&#x27;s first director-general in 1946. His term of office, six years in the Charter, was cut down to two years at the behest of the American delegation. The reasons are not known for sure, but his left-wing tendencies and humanism were likely factors. In a fortnight he dashed off a 60-page booklet on the purpose and philosophy of UNESCO, eventually printed and issued as an official document. There were, however, many conservative opponents of his scientific humanism. His idea of restraining population growth with birth control was anathema to both the Catholic Church and the Comintern/Cominform. In its first few years UNESCO was dynamic and broke new ground; since Huxley it has become larger, more bureaucratic and stable. The personal and social side of the years in Paris are well described by his wife.

Huxley&#x27;s internationalist and conservation interests also led him, with Victor Stolan, Sir Peter Scott, Max Nicholson and Guy Mountfort, to set up the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature under its former name of the World Wildlife Fund).

Another post-war activity was Huxley&#x27;s attack on the Soviet politico-scientist Trofim Lysenko, who had espoused a Lamarckian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy classical genetics in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him as director of the Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of &#x27;sabotage&#x27; and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko&#x27;s machinations were the cause of his arrest. Worse still, Lysenkoism not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the artificial selection of crops on Darwinian principles. This may have contributed to the regular shortage of food from the Soviet agricultural system (Soviet famines). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by Joseph Stalin ended his tolerant attitude. Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov&#x27;s reputation was posthumously restored in 1955.

In the 1950s Huxley played a role in bringing to the English-speaking public the work of the French Jesuit-palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who he believed had been unfairly treated by the Catholic and Jesuit hierarchy. Both men believed in evolution, but differed in its interpretation as Teilhard de Chardin was a Christian, whilst Huxley was an atheist. Huxley wrote the foreword to &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; (1959) and was bitterly attacked by his rationalist friends for doing so.

On Huxley&#x27;s death at 87 on 14 February 1975, John Owen (Director of National Parks for Tanganyika) wrote, &quot;Julian Huxley was one of the world&#x27;s great men ... he played a seminal role in wild life conservation in [East] Africa in the early days... [and in] the far-reaching influence he exerted [on] the international community.&quot;

In addition to his international and humanist concerns, his research interests covered evolution in all its aspects, ethology, embryology, genetics, anthropology and to some extent the infant field of cell biology. Julian&#x27;s eminence as an advocate for evolution, and especially his contribution to the modern evolutionary synthesis, led to his awards of the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956, and the Darwin–Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958. 1958 was the centenary anniversary of the joint presentation &quot;On the tendency of species to form varieties; and the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection&quot; by Darwin and Wallace.

Huxley was a friend and mentor of the biologists and Nobel laureates Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, and taught and encouraged many others. In general, he was more of an all-round naturalist than his famous grandfather, and contributed much to the acceptance of natural selection. His outlook was international, and somewhat idealistic: his interest in progress and evolutionary humanism runs through much of his published work. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

== Special themes ==

=== Evolution ===
Huxley and biologist August Weismann insisted on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution. Huxley was a major player in the mid-twentieth-century modern evolutionary synthesis. He was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public, with a focus on three aspects in particular.

==== Personal influence ====
In the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution, and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by saltation (jumps). These opinions are now standard.Though his time as an academic was quite brief, he taught and encouraged evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s. Charles Elton (ecology), Alister Hardy (marine biology) and John Baker (cytology) all became highly successful, and Baker eventually wrote Huxley&#x27;s Royal Society obituary memoir.Perhaps the most significant was Edmund Brisco Ford, who founded a field of research called ecological genetics, which played a role in the evolutionary synthesis. Another important disciple was Gavin de Beer, who wrote on evolution and development, and became director of the Natural History Museum. Both these scholars had attended Huxley&#x27;s lectures on genetics, experimental zoology (including embryology) and ethology. Later, they became his collaborators, and then leaders in their own right.

In an era when scientists did not travel so frequently as today, Huxley travelled widely in Europe, Africa and the United States. He was therefore able to learn from and influence other scientists, naturalists and administrators. In the US he was able to meet other evolutionists at a critical time in the reassessment of natural selection. In Africa he was able to influence colonial administrators about education and wildlife conservation. In Europe, through UNESCO, he was at the centre of the post-World War II revival of education. In Russia, however, his experiences were mixed. His initially favourable view was changed by his growing awareness of Stalin&#x27;s murderous repression, and the Lysenko affair. There seems little evidence that he had any effect on the Soviet Union, and the same could be said for some other Western scientists. &quot;Marxist-Leninism had become a dogmatic religion... and like all dogmatic religions, it had turned from reform to persecution.&quot;

==== Evolutionary synthesis ====
Huxley was one of the main architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis which took place around the time of World War II. The synthesis of genetic and population ideas produced a consensus which reigned in biology from about 1940, and which is still broadly tenable. &quot;The most informative episode in the history of evolutionary biology was the establishment of the &#x27;neo-Darwinian synthesis&#x27;.&quot; The synthesis was brought about &quot;not by one side being proved right and the others wrong, but by the exchange of the most viable components of the previously competing research strategies&quot;. Ernst Mayr, 1980.

Huxley&#x27;s first &quot;trial run&quot; was the treatment of evolution in the &quot;Science of Life&quot; (1929–30), and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association. In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics. Two of these papers were on the subject of sexual selection, an idea of Darwin&#x27;s whose standing has been revived in recent times. Huxley thought that sexual selection was &quot;...merely an aspect of natural selection which... is concerned with characters which subserve mating, and are usually sex-limited&quot;. This rather grudging acceptance of sexual selection was influenced by his studies on the courtship of the great crested grebe (and other birds that pair for life): the courtship takes place mostly &quot;after&quot; mate selection, not before.
Huxley tackled the subject of evolution at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His role was that of a synthesiser, and it helped that he had met many of the other participants. His book &quot;&quot; was written while he was secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his collection of reprints covering the first part of the century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it &quot;The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing&quot;.

Huxley&#x27;s main co-respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J. B. S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, at the time of Huxley&#x27;s book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. Certainly, for Huxley, E. B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the &quot;authorities cited&quot; index of &quot;Evolution the modern synthesis&quot; shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are: Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright.

Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley&#x27;s citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley&#x27;s book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson&#x27;s later works were such an important contribution.

Huxley coined the terms &quot;the new synthesis&quot; and &quot;evolutionary synthesis&quot;; he also invented the term &quot;cline&quot; in 1938 to refer to species whose members fall into a series of sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area. The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull &quot;Larus&quot; round the Arctic zone. This cline is an example of a &quot;ring species&quot;.Some of Huxley&#x27;s last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of ecological genetics. He noted how widespread polymorphism is in nature, with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others. The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small bivalve molluscs, brittlestars, sea-anemones, tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult.

==== Evolutionary progress ====
Although Huxley believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation, he rejected classical Aristotelian teleology: &quot;The ordinary man, or at least the ordinary poet, philosopher and theologian, always was anxious to find purpose in the evolutionary process. I believe this reasoning to be totally false.&quot;. Huxley coined the phrase &quot;Progress without a goal&quot; to summarise his case in &quot;Evolution the modern synthesis&quot; that evolutionary progress was &quot;a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment.&quot; In &quot;Evolution in action&quot; he wrote thatNatural selection plus time produces biological improvement... &#x27;Improvement&#x27; is not yet a recognised technical term in biology ... however, living things are improved during evolution... Darwin was not afraid to use the word for the results of natural selection in general... I believe that improvement can become one of the key concepts in evolutionary biology.Can it be scientifically defined? Improvements in biological machinery... the limbs and teeth of grazing horses... the increase in brain-power... The eyes of a dragon-fly, which can see all round [it] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life. [Over] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance—improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. &#x27;Advance&#x27; is thus a useful term for long-term improvement in some general property of life. [But] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher&quot;.Huxley&#x27;s views on progressive evolution were similar to those of G. Ledyard Stebbins and Bernhard Rensch, and were challenged in the latter part of the twentieth century with objections from Cladists, among others, to any suggestion that one group could be scientifically described as &quot;advanced&quot; and another as &#x27;primitive&#x27;. Modern assessments of these views have been surveyed in Nitecki and Dawkins.

=== Secular humanism ===

Huxley&#x27;s humanism came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian&#x27;s thinking went along these lines: &quot;The critical point in the evolution of man... was when he acquired the use of [language]... Man&#x27;s development is potentially open... He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which... largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change.&quot; Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics (see evolutionary ethics). Huxley&#x27;s views on God could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.

Huxley had a close association with the British rationalist and secular humanist movements. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1927 until his death, and on the formation of the British Humanist Association in 1963 became its first President, to be succeeded by A. J. Ayer in 1965. He was also closely involved with the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Many of Huxley&#x27;s books address humanist themes. In 1962 Huxley accepted the American Humanist Association&#x27;s annual &quot;Humanist of the Year&quot; award.

Huxley also presided over the founding Congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union and served with John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann on the founding advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York.

=== Religious naturalism ===
Huxley wrote that &quot;There is no separate supernatural realm: all phenomena are part of one natural process of evolution. There is no basic cleavage between science and religion;... I believe that [a] drastic reorganization of our pattern of religious thought is now becoming necessary, from a god-centered to an evolutionary-centred pattern.&quot; Some believe the appropriate label for these views is religious naturalism.
Many people assert that this abandonment of the god hypothesis means the abandonment of all religion and all moral sanctions. This is simply not true. But it does mean, once our relief at jettisoning an outdated piece of ideological furniture is over, that we must construct something to take its place.

=== Parapsychology ===

Huxley took interest in investigating the claims of parapsychology and spiritualism. He joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1928. After investigation he found the field to be unscientific and full of charlatans. In 1934, he joined the International Institute for Psychical Research but resigned after a few months due to its members&#x27; spiritualist bias and non-scientific approach to the subject.

After attending séances, Huxley concluded that the phenomena could be explained &quot;either by natural causes, or, more usually by fraud&quot;. Huxley, Harold Dearden and others were judges for a group formed by the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; to investigate the materialization medium Harold Evans. During a séance Evans was exposed as a fraud. He was caught masquerading as a spirit, in a white nightshirt.

In 1952, Huxley wrote the foreword to Donovan Rawcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Psychology of the Occult&quot;.

=== Eugenics and race ===
Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society, and was vice-president (1937–1944) and President (1959–1962). He thought eugenics was important for removing undesirable variants from the human gene pool, though after World War II he believed race was a meaningless concept in biology, and its application to humans was highly inconsistent.

Huxley was an outspoken critic of the most extreme eugenicism in the 1920s and 1930s (the stimulus for which was the greater fertility of the &#x27;feckless&#x27; poor compared to the &#x27;responsible&#x27; prosperous classes). He was, nevertheless, a leading figure in the eugenics movement (see, for example, Eugenics manifesto). He gave the Galton memorial lecture twice, in 1936 and 1962. In his writing he used this argument several times: &quot;no one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ plasm of agricultural stocks, so why not apply the same concept to human stocks?&quot; The agricultural analogy appears over and over again as it did in the writings of many American eugenicists.

Huxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior. In this passage, from 1941, he investigates a hypothetical scenario where Social Darwinism, capitalism, nationalism and the class society is taken for granted:

If so, then we must plan our eugenic policy along some such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, allegedly less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.

The sentiment is not at all atypical of the time, and similar views were held by many geneticists (William E. Castle, C. B. Davenport, H. J. Muller are examples), and by other prominent intellectuals.

Huxley advocated ensuring the lower classes have a nutritious diet, education and facilities for recreation:

We must therefore concentrate on producing a single equalized environment; and this clearly should be one as favourable as possible to the expression of the genetic qualities that we think desirable. Equally clearly, this should include the following items. A marked raising of the standard of diet for the great majority of the population, until all should be provided both with adequate calories and adequate accessory factors; provision of facilities for healthy exercise and recreation; and upward equalization of educational opportunity. ... we know from various sources that raising the standard of life among the poorest classes almost invariably results in a lowering of their fertility. In so far, therefore, as differential class-fertility exists, raising the environmental level will reduce any dysgenic effects which it may now have.

Concerning a public health and racial policy in general, Huxley wrote that &quot;...unless [civilised societies] invent and enforce adequate measures for regulating human reproduction, for controlling the quantity of population, and &quot;at least preventing the deterioration of quality of racial stock&quot;, they are doomed to decay ...&quot; and remarked how biology should be the chief tool for rendering social politics scientific.

In the opinion of Duvall, &quot;His views fell well within the spectrum of opinion acceptable to the English liberal intellectual elite. He shared &quot;Nature&quot;″s enthusiasm for birth control, and &#x27;voluntary&#x27; sterilization.&quot; However, the word &#x27;English&#x27; in this passage is unnecessary: such views were widespread. Duvall comments that Huxley&#x27;s enthusiasm for centralised social and economic planning and anti-industrial values was common to leftist ideologists during the inter-war years. Towards the end of his life, Huxley himself must have recognised how unpopular these views became after the end of World War II. In the two volumes of his autobiography, there is no mention of eugenics in the index, nor is Galton mentioned; and the subject has also been omitted from many of the obituaries and biographies. An exception is the proceedings of a conference organised by the British Eugenics Society.

In response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s, he was asked to write &quot;We Europeans&quot; with the ethnologist A. C. Haddon, the zoologist Alexander Carr-Saunders and the historian of science Charles Singer. Huxley suggested the word &#x27;race&#x27; be replaced with ethnic group. After the Second World War, he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement &quot;The Race Question&quot;, which asserted that:

A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;&quot;... &quot;National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cult groups do not necessary coincide with racial groups: the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connexion with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term &#x27;race&#x27; is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term &#x27;race&#x27; altogether and speak of &quot;ethnic groups&quot;&quot;... &quot;Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division.&quot; ... &quot;Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races ... The biological fact of race and the myth of &#x27;race&#x27; should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes &#x27;race&#x27; is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth &#x27;race&#x27; has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. It still prevents the normal development of millions of human beings and deprives civilization of the effective co-operation of productive minds. The biological differences between ethnic groups should be disregarded from the standpoint of social acceptance and social action. The unity of mankind from both the biological and social viewpoint is the main thing. To recognize this and to act accordingly is the first requirement of modern man ...

Huxley won the second Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for &quot;We Europeans&quot; in 1937.

In 1951, Huxley popularized the term &quot;transhumanism&quot; for the view that humans should better themselves through science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the social environment.

=== Public life and popularisation ===
Huxley was a capable and willing popularizer of science. Well over half his books are addressed to an educated general audience, and he wrote often in periodicals and newspapers. The most extensive bibliography of Huxley lists some of these ephemeral articles, though there are others unrecorded.

These articles, some reissued as &quot;Essays of a Biologist&quot; (1923), probably led to the invitation from H. G. Wells to help write a comprehensive work on biology for a general readership, &quot;The Science of Life&quot;. This work was published in stages in 1929–30, and in one volume in 1931. Of this Robert Olby said &quot;Book IV &quot;The essence of the controversies about evolution&quot; offers perhaps the clearest, most readable, succinct and informative popular account of the subject ever penned. It was here that he first expounded his own version of what later developed into the evolutionary synthesis&quot;. In his memoirs, Huxley says that he made almost £10,000 from the book.

In 1934 Huxley collaborated with the naturalist Ronald Lockley to create for Alexander Korda the world&#x27;s first natural history documentary &quot;The Private Life of the Gannets&quot;. For the film, shot with the support of the Royal Navy around Grassholm off the Pembrokeshire coast, they won an Oscar for best documentary.

Huxley had given talks on the radio since the 1920s, followed by written versions in &quot;The Listener&quot;. In later life, he became known to an even wider audience through television. In 1939 the BBC asked him to be a regular panelist on a Home Service general knowledge show, &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;, in which he and other panelists were asked to discuss questions submitted by listeners. The show was commissioned to keep up war time morale, by preventing the war from &quot;disrupting the normal discussion of interesting ideas&quot;. The audience was not large for this somewhat elite programme; however, listener research ranked Huxley the most popular member of the Brains Trust from 1941 to 1944.

Later, he was a regular panelist on one of the BBC&#x27;s first quiz shows (1955) &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot; in which participants were asked to talk about objects chosen from museum and university collections.

In 1937 Huxley was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;Rare Animals and the Disappearance of Wild Life&quot;.

In his essay &quot;The Crowded World&quot; Huxley was openly critical of Communist and Catholic attitudes to birth control, population control and overpopulation. Based on variable rates of compound interest, Huxley predicted a probable world population of 6 billion by 2000. The United Nations Population Fund marked 12 October 1999 as The Day of Six Billion.

There is a public house named after Sir Julian in Selsdon, London Borough of Croydon, close to the Selsdon Wood Nature Reserve which he helped establish.

::&quot;Huxley gives the outline of what he believes future humanity could—and should—look like. By pointing out the numerous limitations and feebleness the human nature is—at the time—prone to, and by confronting them with the possibilities humankind has, Huxley expresses the need to research and put into use all possible measures that would enable man achieve utmost perfection.&quot;

<text>Leonard Huxley (11 December 1860 – 3 May 1933) was an English schoolteacher, writer and editor.

== Biography ==
=== Family ===
Huxley&#x27;s father was the zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley, commonly referred to as &#x27;Darwin&#x27;s bulldog&#x27;. He was educated at University College School, London, the University of St Andrews, and Balliol College, Oxford. He first married Julia Arnold who founded a school. She was the daughter of the academic Tom Arnold. She was a sister of the novelist Mrs Humphry Ward, niece of the poet Matthew Arnold, and granddaughter of Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School (immortalised as a character in &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;).

Their four children included the biologist Julian Huxley (1887–1975) and the writer Aldous Huxley (1894–1963). Their middle son, Noel Trevenen (born in 1889), committed suicide in 1914. Their daughter, Margaret Arnold Huxley, was born in 1899. Julia Arnold died of cancer in 1908. 

After the death of his first wife, Leonard married Rosalind Bruce, and had two further sons. The elder of these was David Bruce Huxley (1915–1992), whose daughter Angela married George Pember Darwin, son of the physicist Charles Galton Darwin. The younger was the 1963 Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Andrew Huxley (1917–2012).

Leonard Huxley died at his home in Hampstead on 3 May 1933.

=== Work ===
Huxley&#x27;s major biographies were the three volumes of &quot;Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley&quot; and the two volumes of &quot;Life and Letters of Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker OM GCSI&quot;. He also published &quot;Thomas Henry Huxley: a character sketch&quot;, and a short biography of Darwin. He was assistant master at Charterhouse School between 1884 and 1901. He was then the assistant editor of Cornhill Magazine between 1901 and 1916, becoming its editor in 1916.

<text>Lanfranc, OSB (1005  1010 – 24 May 1089) was a celebrated Italian jurist who renounced his career to become a Benedictine monk at Bec in Normandy. He served successively as prior of Bec Abbey and abbot of St Stephen&#x27;s Abbey in Caen, Normandy and then as Archbishop of Canterbury in England, following its conquest by William the Conqueror. He is also variously known as (), (), and (). In his lifetime, he was regarded as the greatest theologian of his generation.

==Early life==
Lanfranc was born in the early years of the 11th century at Pavia, where later tradition held that his father, Hanbald, held a rank broadly equivalent to magistrate. He was orphaned at an early age.

Lanfranc was trained in the liberal arts, at that time a field in which northern Italy was famous (there is little or no evidence to support the myth that his education included much in the way of Civil Law, and none that links him with Irnerius of Bologna as a pioneer in the renaissance of its study). For unknown reasons at an uncertain date, he crossed the Alps, soon taking up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches, where he taught for three years with conspicuous success. But in 1042 he embraced the monastic profession in the newly founded Bec Abbey. Until 1045 he lived at Bec in absolute seclusion.

==Teacher and scholar==
Lanfranc was then persuaded by Abbot Herluin to open a school at Bec to relieve the monastery&#x27;s poverty. From the first he was celebrated (&quot;totius Latinitatis magister&quot;). His pupils were drawn not only from France and Normandy, but also from Gascony, Flanders, Germany and Italy. Many of them afterwards attained high positions in the Church; one possible student, Anselm of Badagio, became pope under the title of Alexander II; another, Anselm of Bec, succeeded Lanfranc as the Archbishop of Canterbury. The favourite subjects of his lectures were the trivium of grammar, logic and rhetoric and the application of these principles to theological elucidation. In one of Lanfranc&#x27;s most important works, &quot;The Commentary on the Epistles of St. Paul&quot;, he is said to have &#x27;expounded Paul the Apostle; and, wherever opportunity offered, he stated the premises, whether principal or secondary, and the conclusions of Paul&#x27;s arguments in accordance with the rules of Logic&#x27;.

As a result of his growing reputation Lanfranc was invited to defend the doctrine of transubstantiation against the attacks of Berengar of Tours. He took up the task with the greatest zeal, although Berengar had been his personal friend; he was the protagonist of orthodoxy at the Church Councils of Vercelli (1050), Tours (1054) and Rome (1059). To Lanfranc&#x27;s influence is attributed the desertion of Berengar&#x27;s cause by Hildebrand and the more broad-minded of the cardinals. Our knowledge of Lanfranc&#x27;s polemics is chiefly derived from the tract &quot;De corpore et sanguine Domini&quot;, probably written –63. Though betraying no signs of metaphysical ability, his work was regarded as conclusive and became for a while a text-book in the schools. It is often said to be the place where the Aristotelian distinction between substance and accident was first applied to explain Eucharistic change. It is the most important of the surviving works attributed to Lanfranc.

==Prior and abbot==
In the midst of Lanfranc&#x27;s scholastic and controversial activities Lanfranc became a political force. Later tradition told that while he was Prior of Bec he opposed the non-canonical marriage of Duke William with Matilda of Flanders (1053) and carried matters so far that he incurred a sentence of exile. Apparently, their relationship was within the prohibited degrees of kindred. But the quarrel was settled when he was on the point of departure, and he undertook the difficult task of obtaining the pope&#x27;s approval of the marriage. In this he was successful at the same council which witnessed his third victory over Berengar (1059), and he thus acquired a lasting claim on William&#x27;s gratitude. In 1066 Lanfranc became the first Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Étienne at Caen in Normandy, a monastery dedicated to Saint Stephen which the duke had supposedly been enjoined to found as a penance for his disobedience to the Holy See.

Henceforward Lanfranc exercised a perceptible influence on his master&#x27;s policy. William adopted the Cluniac programme of ecclesiastical reform, and obtained the support of Rome for his English expedition by assuming the attitude of a crusader against schism and corruption. It was Alexander II, possibly a pupil of Lanfranc&#x27;s and certainly a close friend, who gave the Norman Conquest the papal benediction—a notable advantage to William at the moment, but subsequently the cause of serious embarrassments.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
When the see of Rouen next fell vacant (1067), the thoughts of the electors turned to Lanfranc. But he declined the honour, and he was appointed to the English primatial see as Archbishop of Canterbury as soon as Stigand had been canonically deposed on 15 August 1070. He was speedily consecrated on 29 August 1070. The new archbishop at once began a policy of reorganisation and reform. His first difficulties were with Thomas of Bayeux, Archbishop-elect of York, (another former pupil) who asserted that his see was independent of Canterbury and claimed jurisdiction over the greater part of the English Midlands. This was the beginning of a long running dispute between the sees of Canterbury and York, usually known as the Canterbury–York dispute.

Lanfranc, during a visit which he paid the pope for the purpose of receiving his pallium, obtained an order from Alexander that the disputed points should be settled by a council of the English Church. This was held at Winchester in 1072. At this council Lanfranc obtained the confirmation of his primacy that he sought; nonetheless he was never able to secure its formal confirmation by the papacy, possibly as a result of the succession of Pope Gregory VII to the papal throne in 1073.

Lanfranc assisted William in maintaining the independence of the English Church; and appears at one time to have favoured the idea of maintaining a neutral attitude on the subject of the quarrels between papacy and empire. In the domestic affairs of England the archbishop showed more spiritual zeal. His grand aim was to extricate the Church from the fetters of corruption. He was a generous patron of monasticism. He endeavoured to enforce celibacy upon the secular clergy.

Lanfranc obtained the king&#x27;s permission to deal with the affairs of the Church in synods. In the cases of Odo of Bayeux (1082) (see Trial of Penenden Heath) and of William of St Calais, Bishop of Durham (1088), he used his legal ingenuity to justify the trial of bishops before a lay tribunal.

Lanfranc accelerated the process of substituting Normans for Englishmen in all preferments of importance; and although his nominees were usually respectable, it cannot be said that all of them were better than the men whom they superseded. There was a considerable mixture for this admixture of secular with spiritual aims. By long tradition, the primate was entitled to a leading position in the king&#x27;s councils, and the interests of the Church demanded that Lanfranc should use his power in a manner not displeasing to the king. On several occasions when William I was absent from England Lanfranc acted as his vicegerent.

Lanfranc&#x27;s greatest political service to the Conqueror was rendered in 1075, when he detected and foiled the conspiracy which had been formed by the earls of Norfolk and Hereford. Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland, one of the rebels, soon lost heart and confessed the conspiracy to Lanfranc, who urged Roger, the earl of Hereford to return to his allegiance, and finally excommunicated him and his adherents. He interceded for Waltheof&#x27;s life and to the last spoke of the earl as an innocent sufferer for the crimes of others; he lived on terms of friendship with Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester.

On the death of the Conqueror in 1087 Lanfranc secured the succession for William Rufus, in spite of the discontent of the Anglo-Norman baronage; and in 1088 his exhortations induced the English militia to fight on the side of the new sovereign against Odo of Bayeux and the other partisans of Duke Robert. He exacted promises of just government from Rufus, and was not afraid to remonstrate when the promises were disregarded. So long as he lived he was a check upon the worst propensities of the king&#x27;s administration. But his restraining hand was too soon removed. In 1089 he was stricken with fever and he died on 24 May amidst universal lamentations. Notwithstanding some obvious moral and intellectual defects, he was the most eminent and the most disinterested of those who had co-operated with William I in riveting Norman rule upon the English Church and people. As a statesman he did something to uphold the traditional ideal of his office; as a primate he elevated the standards of clerical discipline and education. Conceived in the spirit of popes such as Pope Leo IX, his reforms led by a natural sequence to strained relations between Church and State; the equilibrium which he established was unstable, and depended too much upon his personal influence with the Conqueror.

==Beatification and the cause for canonisation==
The efforts of Christ Church Canterbury to secure him the status of saint seem to have had only spasmodic and limited effect beyond English Benedictine circles. However, in the period after the Council of Trent, Lanfranc&#x27;s name was included in the Roman Martyrology, and in the current edition is commemorated as a &#x27;Blessed&#x27; (beatus) on 28 May.

==Modern commemoration==
In 1931, the Archbishop Lanfranc School (now The Archbishop Lanfranc Academy) was opened in Croydon, where he had resided at Croydon Palace. Canterbury Christ Church University have named their accommodation block Lanfranc House. He is also remembered in road names in London and Worthing, West Sussex.

Lanfranc is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 28 May.

==Sources==
The chief authority is the &quot;Vita Lanfranci&quot; by the monk Milo Crispin, who was precentor at Bec and died in 1149. Milo drew largely upon the &quot;Vita Herluini&quot;, composed by Gilbert Crispin, Abbot of Westminster. The &quot;Chronicon Beccensis abbatiae&quot;, a 14th-century compilation, should also be consulted. The first edition of these two sources, and of Lanfranc&#x27;s writings, is that of L. d&#x27;Achery, &quot;Beati Lanfranci opera omnia&quot; (Paris, 1648). Another edition, slightly enlarged, is that of J. A. Giles, &quot;Lanfranci opera&quot; (2 vols., Oxford, 1844). A more recent edition of the Vita Lanfranci was provided by Margaret Gibson. The correspondence between Lanfranc and Pope Gregory VII is given in the &quot;Monumenta Gregoriana&quot; (ed. P. Jaffi, Berlin, 1865). A more modern edition (and translation) of Lanfranc&#x27;s correspondence is to be found in H. Clover and M. Gibson (eds), &quot;The Letters of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury&quot; (Oxford, 1979). His &quot;On the Body and Blood of the Lord&quot; is translated (along with Guitmund of Aversa&#x27;s tract on the same matter) in volume 10 of the &quot;Fathers of the Church Medieval Continuation&quot; (Washington, DC, 2009).

<text>Sir Andrew Fielding Huxley (22 November 191730 May 2012) was an English physiologist and biophysicist. He was born into the prominent Huxley family. After leaving Westminster School in central London, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, on a scholarship, after which he joined Alan Hodgkin to study nerve impulses. Their eventual discovery of the basis for propagation of nerve impulses (called an action potential) earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. They made their discovery from the giant axon of the Atlantic squid. Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command and later transferred to the Admiralty. After the war he resumed research at the University of Cambridge, where he developed interference microscopy that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres.

In 1952, he was joined by a German physiologist Rolf Niedergerke. Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction, popularly called the &quot;sliding filament theory&quot;, which is the foundation of our modern understanding of muscle mechanics. In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, and President in 1980. The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1973 for his collective contributions to the understanding of nerve impulses and muscle contraction. He was conferred a Knight Bachelor by the Queen in 1974, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1983. He was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, until his death.

==Early life and education==

Huxley was born in Hampstead, London, England, on 22 November 1917. He was the youngest son of the writer and editor Leonard Huxley by Leonard Huxley&#x27;s second wife Rosalind Bruce, and hence half-brother of the writer Aldous Huxley and fellow biologist Julian Huxley, and grandson of the biologist T. H. Huxley.

When he was about 12, Andrew and his brother David were given a lathe by their parents. Andrew soon became proficient at designing, making and assembling mechanical objects of all kinds, from wooden candle sticks to a working internal combustion engine. He used these practical skills throughout his career, building much of the specialized equipment he needed for his research. It was also in his early teens that he formed his lifelong interest in microscopy.

He was educated at University College School and Westminster School in Central London, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar. He graduated and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, to read natural sciences. He had intended to become an engineer but switched to physiology after taking the subject to fulfill an elective.

==Career==
Having entered Cambridge in 1935, Huxley graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1938. In 1939, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin returned from the US to take up a fellowship at Trinity College, and Huxley became one of his postgraduate students. Hodgkin was interested in the transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibres. Beginning in 1935 in Cambridge, he had made preliminary measurements on frog sciatic nerves suggesting that the accepted view of the nerve as a simple, elongated battery was flawed. Hodgkin invited Huxley to join him researching the problem. The work was experimentally challenging. One major problem was that the small size of most neurons made it extremely difficult to study them using the techniques of the time. They overcame this by working at the Marine Biological Association laboratory in Plymouth using the giant axon of the longfin inshore squid (&quot;Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii&quot;), which have the largest neurons known. The experiments were still extremely challenging as the nerve impulses only last a few milliseconds, during which time they needed to measure the changing electrical potential at different points along the nerve. Using equipment largely of their own construction and design, including one of the earliest applications of a technique of electrophysiology known as the voltage clamp, they were able to record ionic currents. In 1939, they jointly published a short paper in &quot;Nature&quot; reporting on the work done in Plymouth and announcing their achievement of recording action potentials from inside a nerve fibre.

Then World War II broke out, and their research was abandoned. Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command, where he worked on radar control of anti-aircraft guns. Later he was transferred to the Admiralty to do work on naval gunnery, and worked in a team led by Patrick Blackett. Hodgkin, meanwhile, was working on the development of radar at the Air Ministry. When he had a problem concerning a new type of gun sight, he contacted Huxley for advice. Huxley did a few sketches, borrowed a lathe and produced the necessary parts.

Huxley was elected to a research fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1941. In 1946, with the war ended, he was able to take this up and to resume his collaboration with Hodgkin on understanding how nerves transmit signals. Continuing their work in Plymouth, they were, within six years, able to solve the problem using equipment they built themselves. The solution was that nerve impulses, or action potentials, do not travel down the core of the fiber, but rather along the outer membrane of the fiber as cascading waves of sodium ions diffusing inward on a rising pulse and potassium ions diffusing out on a falling edge of a pulse. In 1952, they published their theory of how action potentials are transmitted in a joint paper, in which they also describe one of the earliest computational models in biochemistry. This model forms the basis of most of the models used in neurobiology during the following four decades.

In 1952, having completed work on action potentials, Huxley was teaching physiology at Cambridge and became interested in another difficult, unsolved problem: how does muscle contract? To make progress on understanding the function of muscle, new ways of observing how the network of filaments behave during contraction were needed. Prior to the war, he had been working on a preliminary design for interference microscopy, which at the time he believed to be original, though it turned out to have been tried 50 years before and abandoned. He, however, was able to make interference microscopy work and to apply it to the problem of muscle contraction with great effect. He was able to view muscle contraction with greater precision than conventional microscopes, and to distinguish types of fiber more easily. By 1953, with the assistance of Rolf Niedergerke, he began to find the features of muscle movement. Around that time, Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson came to a similar observation. Authored in pairs, their papers were simultaneously published in the 22 May 1954 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;. Thus the four people introduced what is called the sliding filament theory of muscle contractions. Huxley synthesized his findings, and the work of colleagues, into a detailed description of muscle structure and how muscle contraction occurs and generates force that he published in 1957. In 1966 his team provided the proof of the theory, and has remained the basis of modern understanding of muscle physiology.

In 1953, Huxley worked at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, as a Lalor Scholar. He gave the Herter Lectures at Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1959 and the Jesup Lectures at Columbia University in 1964. In 1961 he lectured on neurophysiology at Kiev University as part of an exchange scheme between British and Russian professors.

He was an editor of the &quot;Journal of Physiology&quot; from 1950 to 1957 and also of the &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot;. In 1955, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and served on the Council of the Royal Society from 1960 to 1962.

Huxley held college and university posts in Cambridge until 1960, when he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. In addition to his administrative and teaching duties, he continued to work actively on muscle contraction, and also made theoretical contributions to other work in the department, such as that on animal reflectors. In 1963, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his part in discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms of the nerve cell. In 1969 he was appointed to a Royal Society Research Professorship, which he held in the Department of Physiology at University College London.

In 1980, Huxley was elected as President of the Royal Society, a post he held until 1985. In his Presidential Address in 1981, he chose to defend the Darwinian explanation of evolution, as his ancestor, T. H. Huxley had in 1860. Whereas T. H. Huxley was defying the bishops of his day, Sir Andrew was countering new theories of periods of accelerated change. In 1983, he defended the Society&#x27;s decision to elect Margaret Thatcher as a fellow on the ground of her support for science even after 44 fellows had signed a letter of protest.

In 1984, he was elected Master of Trinity, succeeding his longtime collaborator, Sir Alan Hodgkin. His appointment broke the tradition that the office of Master of Trinity alternates between a scientist and an arts man. He was Master until 1990 and was fond of reminding interviewers that Trinity College had more Nobel Prize winners than did the whole of France. He maintained up to his death his position as a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, teaching in physiology, natural sciences and medicine. He was also a fellow of Imperial College London in 1980.

From his experimental work with Hodgkin, Huxley developed a set of differential equations that provided a mathematical explanation for nerve impulses—the &quot;action potential&quot;. This work provided the foundation for all of the current work on voltage-sensitive membrane channels, which are responsible for the functioning of animal nervous systems. Quite separately, he developed the mathematical equations for the operation of myosin &quot;cross-bridges&quot; that generate the sliding forces between actin and myosin filaments, which cause the contraction of skeletal muscles. These equations presented an entirely new paradigm for understanding muscle contraction, which has been extended to provide understanding of almost all of the movements produced by cells above the level of bacteria. Together with the Swiss physiologist Robert Stämpfli, he evidenced the existence of saltatory conduction in myelinated nerve fibres.

==Awards and honours==
Huxley, Alan Hodgkin and John Eccles jointly won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane&quot;. Huxley and Hodgkin won the prize for experimental and mathematical work on the process of nerve action potentials, the electrical impulses that enable the activity of an organism to be coordinated by a central nervous system. Eccles had made important discoveries on synaptic transmission.

Huxley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1955, and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1973 &quot;in recognition of his outstanding studies on the mechanisms of the nerve impulse and of activation of muscular contraction.&quot; Huxley was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 November 1974. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1975 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1979. He was appointed to the Order of Merit on 11 November 1983. In 1976–77, he was President of the British Science Association and from 1980 to 1985 he served as President of the Royal Society. In 1986 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering then known as the Fellowship of Engineering.

Huxley&#x27;s portrait by David Poole hangs in Trinity College&#x27;s collection.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Huxley married Jocelyn &quot;Richenda&quot; Gammell (née Pease), the daughter of the geneticist Michael Pease (a son of Edward R. Pease) and his wife Helen Bowen Wedgwood, eldest daughter of the first Lord Wedgwood (see also Darwin–Wedgwood family). They had one son and five daughters – Janet Rachel Huxley (born 20 April 1948), Stewart Leonard Huxley (born 19 December 1949), Camilla Rosalind Huxley (born 12 March 1952), Eleanor Bruce Huxley (born 21 February 1959), Henrietta Catherine Huxley (born 25 December 1960), and Clare Marjory Pease Huxley (born 4 November 1962).

===Death===
Huxley died at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge on 30 May 2012. He was survived by his six children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. His wife Richenda, Lady Huxley died in 2003, aged 78. A funeral service was held in Trinity College Chapel on 13 June 2012, followed by a private cremation.

<text>In geometry, a hyperboloid of revolution, sometimes called a circular hyperboloid, is the surface generated by rotating a hyperbola around one of its principal axes. A hyperboloid is the surface obtained from a hyperboloid of revolution by deforming it by means of directional scalings, or more generally, of an affine transformation.

A hyperboloid is a quadric surface, that is, a surface defined as the zero set of a polynomial of degree two in three variables. Among quadric surfaces, a hyperboloid is characterized by not being a cone or a cylinder, having a center of symmetry, and intersecting many planes into hyperbolas. A hyperboloid has three pairwise perpendicular axes of symmetry, and three pairwise perpendicular planes of symmetry.

Given a hyperboloid, one can choose a Cartesian coordinate system such that the hyperboloid is defined by one of the following equations:
formula_1 
or
formula_2
The coordinate axes are axes of symmetry of the hyperboloid and the origin is the center of symmetry of the hyperboloid. In any case, the hyperboloid is asymptotic to the cone of the equations:
formula_3

One has a hyperboloid of revolution if and only if formula_4 Otherwise, the axes are uniquely defined (up to the exchange of the &quot;x&quot;-axis and the &quot;y&quot;-axis).

There are two kinds of hyperboloids. In the first case ( in the right-hand side of the equation): a one-sheet hyperboloid, also called a hyperbolic hyperboloid. It is a connected surface, which has a negative Gaussian curvature at every point. This implies near every point the intersection of the hyperboloid and its tangent plane at the point consists of two branches of curve that have distinct tangents at the point. In the case of the one-sheet hyperboloid, these branches of curves are lines and thus the one-sheet hyperboloid is a doubly ruled surface.

In the second case ( in the right-hand side of the equation): a two-sheet hyperboloid, also called an elliptic hyperboloid. The surface has two connected components and a positive Gaussian curvature at every point. The surface is &quot;convex&quot; in the sense that the tangent plane at every point intersects the surface only in this point.

== Parametric representations ==

Cartesian coordinates for the hyperboloids can be defined, similar to spherical coordinates, keeping the azimuth angle , but changing inclination into hyperbolic trigonometric functions:

One-surface hyperboloid: 
formula_5

Two-surface hyperboloid: 
formula_6

The following parametric representation includes hyperboloids of one sheet, two sheets, and their common boundary cone, each with the formula_7-axis as the axis of symmetry:
formula_8

*For formula_9 one obtains a hyperboloid of one sheet, 
*For formula_10 a hyperboloid of two sheets, and 
*For formula_11 a double cone.

One can obtain a parametric representation of a hyperboloid with a different coordinate axis as the axis of symmetry by shuffling the position of the formula_12 term to the appropriate component in the equation above.

===Generalised equations===
More generally, an arbitrarily oriented hyperboloid, centered at , is defined by the equation
formula_13
where is a matrix and , are vectors.

The eigenvectors of define the principal directions of the hyperboloid and the eigenvalues of A are the reciprocals of the squares of the semi-axes: formula_14, formula_15 and formula_16. The one-sheet hyperboloid has two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue. The two-sheet hyperboloid has one positive eigenvalue and two negative eigenvalues.

== Properties ==

=== Hyperboloid of one sheet ===
==== Lines on the surface ====
*A hyperboloid of one sheet contains two pencils of lines. It is a doubly ruled surface. 
If the hyperboloid has the equation
formula_17 then the lines

formula_18
are contained in the surface.

In case formula_19 the hyperboloid is a surface of revolution and can be generated by rotating one of the two lines formula_20 or formula_21, which are skew to the rotation axis (see picture). This property is called &quot;Wren&#x27;s theorem&quot;. The more common generation of a one-sheet hyperboloid of revolution is rotating a hyperbola around its semi-minor axis (see picture; rotating the hyperbola around its other axis gives a two-sheet hyperbola of revolution).

A hyperboloid of one sheet is &quot;projectively&quot; equivalent to a hyperbolic paraboloid.

==== Plane sections ====
For simplicity the plane sections of the &quot;unit hyperboloid&quot; with equation formula_22 are considered. Because a hyperboloid in general position is an affine image of the unit hyperboloid, the result applies to the general case, too.

*A plane with a slope less than 1 (1 is the slope of the lines on the hyperboloid) intersects formula_23 in an &quot;ellipse&quot;,
*A plane with a slope equal to 1 containing the origin intersects formula_23 in a &quot;pair of parallel lines&quot;,
*A plane with a slope equal 1 not containing the origin intersects formula_23 in a &quot;parabola&quot;,
*A tangential plane intersects formula_23 in a &quot;pair of intersecting lines&quot;,
*A non-tangential plane with a slope greater than 1 intersects formula_23 in a &quot;hyperbola&quot;.
Obviously, any one-sheet hyperboloid of revolution contains circles. This is also true, but less obvious, in the general case (see circular section).

=== Hyperboloid of two sheets ===
The hyperboloid of two sheets does &quot;not&quot; contain lines. The discussion of plane sections can be performed for the &quot;unit hyperboloid of two sheets&quot; with equation
formula_28
which can be generated by a rotating hyperbola around one of its axes (the one that cuts the hyperbola)

*A plane with slope less than 1 (1 is the slope of the asymptotes of the generating hyperbola) intersects formula_29 either in an &quot;ellipse&quot; or in a &quot;point&quot; or not at all,
*A plane with slope equal to 1 containing the origin (midpoint of the hyperboloid) does &quot;not intersect&quot; formula_29,
*A plane with slope equal to 1 not containing the origin intersects formula_29 in a &quot;parabola&quot;, 
*A plane with slope greater than 1 intersects formula_29 in a &quot;hyperbola&quot;.
Obviously, any two-sheet hyperboloid of revolution contains circles. This is also true, but less obvious, in the general case (see circular section).

&quot;Remark:&quot; A hyperboloid of two sheets is &quot;projectively&quot; equivalent to a sphere.

===Other properties===

==== Symmetries ====
The hyperboloids with equations 
formula_33
are
*&quot;pointsymmetric&quot; to the origin,
*&quot;symmetric to the coordinate planes&quot; and
*&quot;rotational symmetric&quot; to the z-axis and symmetric to any plane containing the z-axis, in case of formula_34 (hyperboloid of revolution).

==== Curvature ====
Whereas the Gaussian curvature of a hyperboloid of one sheet is negative, that of a two-sheet hyperboloid is positive. In spite of its positive curvature, the hyperboloid of two sheets with another suitably chosen metric can also be used as a model for hyperbolic geometry.

==In more than three dimensions==
Imaginary hyperboloids are frequently found in mathematics of higher dimensions. For example, in a pseudo-Euclidean space one has the use of a quadratic form:
formula_35 
When is any constant, then the part of the space given by
formula_36
is called a &quot;hyperboloid&quot;. The degenerate case corresponds to .

As an example, consider the following passage:
... the velocity vectors always lie on a surface which Minkowski calls a four-dimensional hyperboloid since, expressed in terms of purely real coordinates , its equation is , analogous to the hyperboloid of three-dimensional space.

However, the term quasi-sphere is also used in this context since the sphere and hyperboloid have some commonality (See below).

== Hyperboloid structures ==

One-sheeted hyperboloids are used in construction, with the structures called hyperboloid structures. A hyperboloid is a doubly ruled surface; thus, it can be built with straight steel beams, producing a strong structure at a lower cost than other methods. Examples include cooling towers, especially of power stations, and many other structures.

==Relation to the sphere==
In 1853 William Rowan Hamilton published his &quot;Lectures on Quaternions&quot; which included presentation of biquaternions. The following passage from page 673 shows how Hamilton uses biquaternion algebra and vectors from quaternions to produce hyperboloids from the equation of a sphere:
... the &quot;equation of the unit sphere&quot; , and change the vector to a &quot;bivector form&quot;, such as . The equation of the sphere then breaks up into the system of the two following,

and suggests our considering and as two real and rectangular vectors, such that

Hence it is easy to infer that if we assume , where is a vector in a given position, the &quot;new real vector&quot; will terminate on the surface of a &quot;double-sheeted and equilateral hyperboloid&quot;; and that if, on the other hand, we assume , then the locus of the extremity of the real vector will be an &quot;equilateral but single-sheeted hyperboloid&quot;. The study of these two hyperboloids is, therefore, in this way connected very simply, through biquaternions, with the study of the sphere; ...
In this passage is the operator giving the scalar part of a quaternion, and is the &quot;tensor&quot;, now called norm, of a quaternion.

A modern view of the unification of the sphere and hyperboloid uses the idea of a conic section as a slice of a quadratic form. Instead of a conical surface, one requires conical hypersurfaces in four-dimensional space with points determined by quadratic forms. First consider the conical hypersurface
*formula_37 and
*formula_38 which is a hyperplane.
Then formula_39 is the sphere with radius . On the other hand, the conical hypersurface
In the theory of quadratic forms, a unit quasi-sphere is the subset of a quadratic space consisting of the such that the quadratic norm of is one.

<doc id="145845" wikidata="Q192768" url="?curid=145845" title="Paraboloid">
<text>In geometry, a paraboloid is a quadric surface that has exactly one axis of symmetry and no center of symmetry. The term &quot;paraboloid&quot; is derived from parabola, which refers to a conic section that has a similar property of symmetry.

Every plane section of a paraboloid made by a plane parallel to the axis of symmetry is a parabola. The paraboloid is hyperbolic if every other plane section is either a hyperbola, or two crossing lines (in the case of a section by a tangent plane). The paraboloid is elliptic if every other nonempty plane section is either an ellipse, or a single point (in the case of a section by a tangent plane). A paraboloid is either elliptic or hyperbolic.

Equivalently, a paraboloid may be defined as a quadric surface that is not a cylinder, and has an implicit equation whose part of degree two may be factored over the complex numbers into two different linear factors. The paraboloid is hyperbolic if the factors are real; elliptic if the factors are complex conjugate.

An elliptic paraboloid is shaped like an oval cup and has a maximum or minimum point when its axis is vertical. In a suitable coordinate system with three axes , , and , it can be represented by the equation
formula_1
where and are constants that dictate the level of curvature in the and planes respectively. In this position, the elliptic paraboloid opens upward.
A hyperbolic paraboloid (not to be confused with a hyperboloid) is a doubly ruled surface shaped like a saddle. In a suitable coordinate system, a hyperbolic paraboloid can be represented by the equation
formula_2
In this position, the hyperbolic paraboloid opens downward along the -axis and upward along the -axis (that is, the parabola in the plane opens upward and the parabola in the plane opens downward).

Any paraboloid (elliptic or hyperbolic) is a translation surface, as it can be generated by a moving parabola directed by a second parabola.

== Properties and applications ==
=== Elliptic paraboloid ===
In a suitable Cartesian coordinate system, an elliptic paraboloid has the equation
formula_3

If , an elliptic paraboloid is a &quot;circular paraboloid&quot; or &quot;paraboloid of revolution&quot;. It is a surface of revolution obtained by revolving a parabola around its axis.

A circular paraboloid contains circles. This is also true in the general case (see Circular section).

From the point of view of projective geometry, an elliptic paraboloid is an ellipsoid that is tangent to the plane at infinity.

; Plane sections
The plane sections of an elliptic paraboloid can be:
* a &quot;parabola&quot;, if the plane is parallel to the axis,
* a &quot;point&quot;, if the plane is a tangent plane.
* an &quot;ellipse&quot; or &quot;empty&quot;, otherwise.

====Parabolic reflector====

On the axis of a circular paraboloid, there is a point called the &quot;focus&quot; (or &quot;focal point&quot;), such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light (or other waves) from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the other way around: a parallel beam of light that is parallel to the axis of the paraboloid is concentrated at the focal point. For a proof, see .

Therefore, the shape of a circular paraboloid is widely used in astronomy for parabolic reflectors and parabolic antennas.

The surface of a rotating liquid is also a circular paraboloid. This is used in liquid-mirror telescopes and in making solid telescope mirrors (see rotating furnace).
=== Hyperbolic paraboloid ===

The hyperbolic paraboloid is a doubly ruled surface: it contains two families of mutually skew lines. The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each other. Hence the hyperbolic paraboloid is a conoid.

These properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest definitions of hyperbolic paraboloids: &quot;a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed plane and crosses two fixed skew lines&quot;.

This property makes it simple to manufacture a hyperbolic paraboloid from a variety of materials and for a variety of purposes, from concrete roofs to snack foods. In particular, Pringles fried snacks resemble a truncated hyperbolic paraboloid.

A hyperbolic paraboloid is a saddle surface, as its Gauss curvature is negative at every point. Therefore, although it is a ruled surface, it is not developable.

From the point of view of projective geometry, a hyperbolic paraboloid is one-sheet hyperboloid that is tangent to the plane at infinity.

A hyperbolic paraboloid of equation formula_4 or formula_5 (this is the same up to a rotation of axes) may be called a &quot;rectangular hyperbolic paraboloid&quot;, by analogy with rectangular hyperbolas.

;Plane sections

A plane section of a hyperbolic paraboloid with equation 
formula_6
can be
* a &quot;line&quot;, if the plane is parallel to the -axis, and has an equation of the form formula_7, 
* a &quot;parabola&quot;, if the plane is parallel to the -axis, and the section is not a line,
* a pair of &quot;intersecting lines&quot;, if the plane is a tangent plane, 
* a &quot;hyperbola&quot;, otherwise.
====Examples in architecture====

Saddle roofs are often hyperbolic paraboloids as they are easily constructed from straight sections of material. Some examples:
* Philips Pavilion Expo &#x27;58, Brussels (1958)
* IIT Delhi - Dogra Hall Roof
* St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Tokyo, Japan (1964)
* St Richard&#x27;s Church, Ham, in Ham, London, England (1966)
* Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, San Francisco, California, US (1971)
* Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, Canada (1983)
* Scandinavium in Gothenburg, Sweden (1971)
* L&#x27;Oceanogràfic in Valencia, Spain (2003)
* London Velopark, England (2011)
* Waterworld Leisure &amp; Activity Centre, Wrexham, Wales (1970)
* Markham Moor Service Station roof, A1(southbound), Nottinghamshire, England
* Cafe &quot;Kometa&quot;, Sokol district, Moscow, Russia (1960). Architect V.Volodin, engineer N.Drozdov. Demolished.

== Cylinder between pencils of elliptic and hyperbolic paraboloids ==
The pencil of elliptic paraboloids
formula_8 
and the pencil of hyperbolic paraboloids
formula_9 
approach the same surface 
formula_10
for formula_11,
which is a &quot;parabolic cylinder&quot; (see image).

== Curvature ==
The elliptic paraboloid, parametrized simply as
formula_12
has Gaussian curvature
formula_13
and mean curvature
formula_14
which are both always positive, have their maximum at the origin, become smaller as a point on the surface moves further away from the origin, and tend asymptotically to zero as the said point moves infinitely away from the origin.

The hyperbolic paraboloid, when parametrized as
formula_15
has Gaussian curvature
formula_16
and mean curvature
formula_17

== Geometric representation of multiplication table ==
If the hyperbolic paraboloid
formula_6
is rotated by an angle of in the direction (according to the right hand rule), the result is the surface
formula_19
and if then this simplifies to
formula_20
Finally, letting , we see that the hyperbolic paraboloid
formula_21
is congruent to the surface
formula_22
which can be thought of as the geometric representation (a three-dimensional nomograph, as it were) of a multiplication table.

The two paraboloidal functions
formula_23
and
formula_24
are harmonic conjugates, and together form the analytic function
formula_25
which is the analytic continuation of the parabolic function .

== Dimensions of a paraboloidal dish ==
The dimensions of a symmetrical paraboloidal dish are related by the equation
formula_26
where is the focal length, is the depth of the dish (measured along the axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim), and is the radius of the rim. They must all be in the same unit of length. If two of these three lengths are known, this equation can be used to calculate the third.

A more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish &quot;measured along its surface&quot;. This is sometimes called the &quot;linear diameter&quot;, and equals the diameter of a flat, circular sheet of material, usually metal, which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish. Two intermediate results are useful in the calculation: (or the equivalent: ) and , where , , and are defined as above. The diameter of the dish, measured along the surface, is then given by
formula_27
where means the natural logarithm of , i.e. its logarithm to base .

The volume of the dish, the amount of liquid it could hold if the rim were horizontal and the vertex at the bottom (e.g. the capacity of a paraboloidal wok), is given by
formula_28
where the symbols are defined as above. This can be compared with the formulae for the volumes of a cylinder (), a hemisphere (, where ), and a cone (). is the aperture area of the dish, the area enclosed by the rim, which is proportional to the amount of sunlight a reflector dish can intercept. The surface area of a parabolic dish can be found using the area formula for a surface of revolution which gives
formula_29

<text>Ratramnus (died ) was a Frankish monk of the monastery of Corbie, near Amiens in northern France, and a Carolingian theologian known best for his writings on the Eucharist and predestination. His Eucharistic treatise &quot;De corpore et sanguine Domini&quot; (&quot;On the Body and Blood of the Lord&quot;) was a counterpoint to his abbot Paschasius Radbertus’s realist Eucharistic theology. Ratramnus was also known for his defense of the monk Gottschalk, whose theology of double predestination was the center of much controversy in 9th-century France and Germany. In his own time, Ratramnus was perhaps best known for his &quot;Against the Objections of the Greeks who Slandered the Roman Church&quot;, a response to the Photian schism and defense of the filioque addition to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. The writings of Ratramnus influenced the Protestant reformation of the 16th century.

==Biography==
Little is known of Ratramnus’ life, but some have suggested that he became the teaching master at the Benedictine monastery of Corbie in 844, when Paschasius Radbertus was made abbot. Additionally, he appears to have had a reasonably close relationship with King Charles the Bald.

==The Eucharist==
Sometime around 831-833, Paschasius Radbertus, in his role as a teacher in the monastery at Corbie, wrote &quot;De corpore et sanguine Domini&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Body and Blood of the Lord&quot;), articulating the view that in the moment of consecration, the bread and wine on the altar became identical with the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Paschasius was clear that the body and blood on the altar are precisely the same natural body and blood as Christ’s incarnate body on earth. In his description of the Eucharist, Paschasius drew a distinction between &quot;figura&quot; (figure) and &quot;veritas&quot; (truth), which he understood to mean “outward appearance” and “what faith teaches”, respectively. No controversy seems to have arisen as a result of Paschasius’s treatise, which he first composed likely as a teaching aid and dedicated to one of his former students. Later, probably in 844, Paschasius also composed a revision of his book on the Eucharist, dedicated to Charles the Bald.

When Charles the Bald visited Corbie in 843, he apparently met Ratramnus and requested an explanation of the Eucharist. It was to the emperor, then, that Ratramnus addressed his work, also entitled &quot;De corpore et sanguine Domini&quot;. In this book, Ratramnus advocated a spiritual view in which the bread and the wine of the Eucharist represent Christ’s body and blood figuratively and serve as a remembrance of him, but are not truly (perceptible by the senses) Christ’s body and blood. Ratramnus used the same two terms (&quot;figura&quot; and &quot;veritas&quot;) to describe the Eucharist as Paschasius, but used them differently. For him, &quot;veritas&quot; meant “perceptible to the senses”, so the Eucharist could not &quot;truly&quot; be Christ’s body and blood, as it – according to the senses – did not change in appearance, but remained bread and wine, nor was it literally Christ’s historical incarnate body.

No condemnations were issued as a result of the debate, and neither of the two monks quoted or referred to the other in his work. On account of this, Willemien Otten has challenged the traditional interpretation of Paschasius&#x27;s and Ratramnus’s different positions as a “controversy”.

==Predestination==
In the 840s and 50s, Ratramnus became involved in the controversy over the teachings of Gottschalk of Orbais (ca. 803-68). Ratramnus probably first encountered Gottschalk during the wandering teacher’s stay at the monastery of Corbie around 830, and later supported him in his conflict with archbishop Hincmar of Rheims. Gottschalk taught a form of double predestination, teaching that God predestined the fates of both the elect and the damned.

In 851, John Scotus Eriugena was commissioned to oppose Gottschalk’s teaching, but his work, &quot;Treatise on Divine Predestination&quot;, essentially denied any form of predestination whatsoever, a denial which raised the ire of Ratramnus and Florus of Lyon. In response, Ratramnus composed the two-book work &quot;On the Predestination of God&quot; (&quot;De Praedestinatione Dei&quot;), in which he defended double predestination, while objecting to the relation of predestination to sin.

==Filioque==
Late in Ratramnus’ life, he responded to the Photian schism of 863-7 between Eastern and Western Christianity over the appointment of Photius as Patriarch of Constantinople. This wide-ranging controversy spanned various East-West disagreements, such as the appointment of the patriarch, ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Bulgaria, and the Western addition of &quot;filioque&quot; to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. Ratramnus’ defense of Western theology and practice in his &quot;Against the Objections of the Greeks who Slandered the Roman Church&quot;, is largely occupied with proving the &quot;filioque&quot;, although the final section of the work deals with other disagreements, such as the monastic tonsure and priestly celibacy.

==Other works==
In another show of support for Gottschalk, Ratramnus composed a short collection of patristic texts in favor of Gottschalk’s Trinitarian formulation of &quot;trina deitas&quot; against Hincmar of Rheims’ proposed &quot;summa deitas&quot;.

Ratramnus also wrote a &quot;Letter on the Dog-headed Creatures&quot;. This was in response to a question from Rimbert, then working as a missionary in Scandinavia, who asked whether the cynocephali believed to live nearby were human, because if they were Rimbert would be expected to attempt to convert them. Ratramnus argued that because Rimbert’s sources described the cynocephali as living in villages and engaging in agriculture and crafts, they must be rational and therefore human.

Ratramnus wrote another treatise, &quot;The Birth of Christ&quot;, possibly as a response to Paschasius’ &quot;De Partu Virginis&quot;. In this work, Ratramnus defended the idea that Christ’s birth from the Virgin Mary occurred in the natural human way, so as to not detract from Christ’s real human nature.

Ratramnus wrote two treatises on the soul, upholding traditional Augustinian psychology. The first, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, was written against someone named Macarius Scotus, and the second, &quot;The Book on the Soul&quot;, addressed to bishop Odo I of Beauvais, challenged an idea raised by an anonymous monk of Fly Abbey – that all human beings participate in a universal soul. In &quot;The Book on the Soul&quot;, Ratramnus argued that a soul cannot be universal, only individual.

On a whole, Ratramnus’ works have been described by medieval scholar Giulio D&#x27;Onofrio as marked by a careful methodological clarity and consistency possibly modeled on Boethius’ &quot;Answer to Eutyches&quot;.

==Later reception==
At some point, Ratramnus’ Eucharistic work &quot;De corpore et sanguine Domini&quot; came to be identified as the work of John Scotus Eriugena. In the 11th century, Berengar of Tours seized upon “Scotus’” book as a source for his view of the Eucharist in his debate with Lanfranc of Bec, and was summarily condemned by the local Council of Vercelli in 1050. Around 1100, further confusion arose when Ratramnus’ name was mistakenly copied in some works as Bertramus, a mistake which endured even into the 19th century.

In the 16th century, Ratramnus’ work once more became the center of controversy. After &quot;De corpore et sanguine Domini&quot; was printed in 1531, Protestant reformers seized upon the book as a counterpoint to the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. It was especially influential in England, where Thomas Cranmer claimed to have been finally convinced against transubstantiation by Ratramnus.

<doc id="145851" wikidata="Q243702" url="?curid=145851" title="Second Council of the Lateran">
<text>The Second Council of the Lateran was the tenth ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. It was convened by Pope Innocent II in April 1139 and attended by close to a thousand clerics. Its immediate task was to neutralise the after-effects of the schism which had arisen after the death of Pope Honorius II in 1130 and the papal election that year that established Pietro Pierleoni as the antipope Anacletus II.

==Tenth Ecumenical Council==
After the death of Honorius II, Petrus Leonis, under the name of Anacletus II, was elected as Pope by a majority of the cardinals and with the support of the people of Rome on the same day as a minority elected Innocent II. In 1135, Innocent II held a council at Pisa, which confirmed his authority and condemned Anacletus. Anacletus&#x27;s death in 1138 helped largely to solve the tension between rival factions. Nevertheless, Innocent decided to call the Tenth Ecumenical Council.

The council assembled at the Lateran Palace and nearly a thousand prelates attended. In his opening statement Innocent deposed those who had been ordained and instituted by Anacletus or any of his adherents. King Roger II of Sicily was excommunicated for maintaining what was thought to be a schismatic attitude.

The council also condemned the teachings of the Petrobrusians and the Henricians, the followers of Peter of Bruys and Henry of Lausanne. Finally, the council drew up measures for the amendment of ecclesiastical morals and discipline which the council fathers considered had grown lax. Many of the canons relating to these matters were mostly a restating of the decrees of the Council of Reims and the Council of Clermont.

==Select canons==
The most important results of the council included:
* Canon 4: Injunction to bishops and ecclesiastics not to cause scandal by wearing ostentatious clothes but to dress modestly.
* Canons 6, 7: Repeated the First Lateran Council&#x27;s condemnation of marriage and concubinage among priests, deacons, subdeacons, monks, and nuns.
* Canon 10: Excommunicated laity who failed to pay the tithes due the bishops,
* Canon 12: Fixed the periods and the duration of the Truce of God.
* Canon 14: Prohibition, under pain of deprivation of Christian burial, of jousts and tournaments which endangered life.
* Canon 20: Kings and princes were ordered to dispense justice in consultation with the bishops.
* Canon 23: Forbade the condemnation of legitimate marriages.
* Canon 25: Forbade any cleric to accept a benefice from a layman.
* Canon 27: Nuns were prohibited from singing the Divine Office in the same choir with monks.
* Canon 28: No church was to be left vacant more than three years from the death of the bishop; secular canons who excluded regular canons or monks from episcopal elections were condemned.
* Canon 29: The use of bows and slings (or perhaps crossbows) against Christians was prohibited.

Another decision confirmed the right of religious houses of a diocese to participate in the election of the diocese&#x27;s bishop.
