<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot;, also known by its incipit &quot;&#x27;&quot;, is the national anthem of Iceland. Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson composed the music, while the lyrics were authored by Matthías Jochumsson. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1944, when the country declared independence by voting to end its &quot;personal union&quot; and become a republic.

==History==


The late 19th century saw music in Iceland develop and flourish. Though many of their initial composers had to study and apply their trade abroad due to insufficient opportunities on offer at home, they were able to bring what they had learned back to Iceland. One of these musicians was Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson, who was the first person from his homeland to pursue &quot;an international career as a composer&quot;. He sojourned in Edinburgh during the early 1870s, and wrote the music for Lofsöngur inside a town house located in the city&#x27;s New Town in 1874. By 1922, the song became so well known and loved throughout Iceland that, in recognition of this, the Althing endowed Sveinbjörnsson with a state pension. He was the first composer in the country to be conferred such an honour.

The lyrical portion of it was penned by Matthías Jochumsson, one of the &quot;best loved poets&quot; in the country who was also a priest. Although the commemorative plaque in Edinburgh purports that both the music and lyrics were written there, it is nowadays believed that Jochumsson had in fact produced the latter back in his homeland. Much like Sveinbjörnsson, Jochumsson became the first Icelandic poet to be given a state pension. The Althing also bestowed on him the title of &quot;National Poet&quot;.

It was written to coincide with the 1874 festivities in honor of one millennium since the Norse first arrived on the island. It is for this reason that the full translation of the anthem&#x27;s title is &quot;The Millennial Hymn of Iceland&quot;. The song was first played on August 2 of that year, at a service celebrated at Reykjavík Cathedral to commemorate the milestone, with the King of Iceland, Christian IX, in attendance. However, the song was not officially adopted as the country&#x27;s national anthem until 70 years later in 1944, when Icelanders voted in a referendum to end their state&#x27;s personal union with Denmark and become a republic.

==Lyrics==
Although the Icelandic national anthem consists of three stanzas, only the first one is sung on a regular basis.

==Criticism==
The anthem is notorious for being challenging to sing, due to its large vocal range of high and low vocal registers—spanning a minor fourteenth. &quot;Lofsöngur&quot; has been described as a Christian hymn to God with strong religious themes. Thus, its suitability as the national anthem in Iceland&#x27;s increasingly secular society of the present-day has been challenged, notwithstanding the fact that the country still maintains an official religion in the form of the Church of Iceland. Some have suggested replacing it with a non-religious song that is more all-encompassing.

<text>AC Cars, originally incorporated as Auto Carriers Ltd., is a British specialist automobile manufacturer and one of the oldest independent car makers founded in Britain. As a result of bad financial conditions over the years, the company was renamed or liquidated many times until its latest form. In 2022, the new corporate structure began the production of new AC Cobra models, with a slightly modified structure to adapt it to modern safety and technology requirements and obtain the European road homologation certificate.

==History==

=== The Weller brothers prototype ===
The first car from the company that eventually became AC was presented at the Crystal Palace motor show in 1903; it was a 20 HP touring car and was displayed under the Weller name. The Weller brothers of West Norwood, London, planned to produce an advanced car.

However, their financial backer and business manager John Portwine, a butcher, thought the car would be too expensive to produce and encouraged Weller to design and produce a little delivery three-wheeler.

=== Autocars and Accessories ===
In 1904, a new company was founded and named Autocars and Accessories; production started with the Auto-Carrier. The vehicle caught on quickly and was a financial success. Three years later, a passenger version appeared, called the A.C. Sociable. It had a seat in place of the cargo box.

The A.C. Sociable was described in a review of the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show as &quot;one of the most popular cycle cars on the road, both for pleasure and business&quot;, and A.C. displayed eight vehicles on their stand, six for pleasure and two for business. The single rear wheel contained a two-speed hub, and the single-cylinder engine was mounted just in front of it, with rear chain drive.

=== Auto Carriers Ltd. ===
The company became Auto Carriers Ltd. in 1911 and moved to Ferry Works, Thames Ditton, Surrey — at this time, they also began using the famed &quot;AC&quot; roundel logo. They continued to produce the commercial 3-wheeler tricars and the A.C. Sociable now frequently referred to in their adverts as the Mighty Atom. Their first four-wheeled car was produced in 1913; it was a sporty two-seater with a gearbox on the rear axle. Only a few were built before production was interrupted by the First World War. During the First World War, the Ferry Works factory produced shells and fuses for the war effort, although at least one vehicle was designed and built for the War Office.

At the end of the war, Auto Carriers started making motor vehicles again, designing and building many successful cars at Ferry Works, as well as expanding into an old balloon factory on Thames Ditton High Street. Shortly thereafter, John Weller started on the design of a new overhead-cam six-cylinder engine. The first versions of this design were running by 1919. The Weller engine would be produced until 1963.

In 1921, Selwyn Edge (who had previously been with Napier) bought shares in the company, and was subsequently appointed governing director. He did not get along with Weller or Portwine, who resigned less than a year later. In customary fashion, Edge sought publicity for the company through motoring competition.

In 1921 Sammy Davis joined A.C. as a driver, competing in the Junior Car Club race, for cars up to 1,500cc, at Brooklands.

=== AC Cars Ltd. ===
In 1922, the name changed again to AC Cars Ltd. In 1923 and 1924, J.A. Joyce won the Brighton Speed Trials driving an AC. In May 1924, at Montlhéry near Paris, T.G. Gillett broke the continuous 24-hour record in a 2-litre AC, fitted with special streamlined bodywork, covering a distance of 1,949.3 miles. In 1926, the Honourable Victor Bruce, an AC employee, won the Monte Carlo Rally in his 2-litre AC. In 1927, Victor Bruce, with his wife Mildred (The Hon Mrs Victor Bruce), assisted by J.A. Joyce, set a 10-day endurance record at Montlhéry, driving an AC Six. Nevertheless, the sales started to fall.

=== AC (Acedes) Ltd. ===
Selwyn Edge bought the company outright for £135,000 in 1927 and re-registered it as AC (Acedes) Ltd., but sales, which had been falling, continued to decline. The company was caught by the crash of 1929 and went into voluntary liquidation.

Production ceased for a time, and the company was sold to the Hurlock family who ran a successful haulage business. They wanted the High Street factory only as a warehouse (Ferry Works was not acquired), but allowed the service side of AC to continue.

A single car was made for William Hurlock in 1930. He liked it and agreed to restart very limited production using components left over from previous models.

An agreement was reached with Standard to supply new chassis, the ancient three-speed transaxle was replaced by a modern four-speed gearbox (built in unit with the engine), and by 1932 a new range of cars was launched. Production continued on a small scale, averaging less than 100 vehicles per year, until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The final pre-war car was delivered in June 1940, after which the factory was fully involved with war production.



After the war, AC secured a large contract with the government to produce the fibreglass-bodied, single seat, Thundersley Invacar Type 57 invalid carriages with Villiers 2-stroke engines. The invalid carriages continued to be built until 1976 and were an important source of revenue for the company.
Production restarted in 1947 with the 2-Litre, using the 1991 cc engine from the 16. The 2-Litre used an updated version of the pre-war, underslung chassis, fitted with the AC straight-six engine and traditional ash-framed and aluminium-panelled coachwork, available in saloon or convertible versions.
They also built an aluminium-bodied three-wheeled microcar, the Petite, as well as &quot;Bag Boy&quot; golf carts (with independent suspension to the two wheels).

In 1953, the firm began production of the AC Ace, based on a lightweight chassis designed by John Tojeiro and hand built aluminium body designed and built by Eric George Gray with the venerable Weller-designed 2-Litre engine.

For 1954, a new aluminium-bodied closed coupe was unveiled at Earls Court, the AC Aceca, pronounced A-seek-a. It was only slightly heavier than the convertible Ace, and because of better aerodynamics was also slightly faster ( top speed).

Acecas are popular at historic racing events. Arch McNeill, a factory Morgan racer from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s told fellow Texan and Aceca owner Glenn Barnett that &quot;the Morgan team spent two years campaigning to beat the factory AC Acecas and finally did in the late 1950s&quot;. Though more valuable than comparable AC or Shelby replicas, the Aceca is still a bargain when compared to a Shelby CSX Cobra, while maintaining similar performance.

There was a demand from some customers for a larger four-seater car, for whom AC produced the Greyhound. This was built on a stretched Ace chassis with coil suspension all around and a 2.2-litre Bristol engine.

The AC Ace LM Prototype was a single piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro designed on behalf of the brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long-distance racing. The vehicle was only and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by artist Cavendish Morton, who also styled other sports cars. The engine and transmission unit were tuned production unit from the Bristol Type 100D2/S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the not yet fully tuned prototype completed two events in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next event in its class in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The Bristol drivetrain went back to the manufacturer and the racing car was sold without it and later rebuilt. The Ace LM prototype was acquired by a collector.

The &quot;AC Ace Bristol Zagato&quot; was designed and built by Zagato from the year 1958. Conceptually, the Berlinetta resembles the two-seat factory coupe &#x27; &#x27;AC Aceca&#x27; &#x27;, but on the chassis number BEX 477 of a left hand drive &#x27;AC Ace Bristol&#x27;. The idea came about at the Geneva Motor Show in 1957 during a meeting between Hubert Patthey, the then &quot; AC &quot; and &quot; Aston Martin &quot; importer for Switzerland and Elio Zagato. The original vehicle from 1957 was delivered to the Swiss company Pattheys in 1958; Who commissioned the &quot; Carrozzeria Zagato &quot; to produce a single, individual car body for the vehicle to be used at local races and the Pescara rally. Zagato designed and built a coupé body made of thin-walled aluminium sheet with Zagato&#x27;s trademark &quot;Double Bubble&quot;, a solid roof with two vaults above the driver&#x27;s and co-driver&#x27;s seat to ensure sufficient headroom at low headroom. Patthey sold the finished vehicle to an Englishman who lived in Switzerland, who was negotiating with him for various rides near Lake Geneva; Later the racing driver Jo Siffert acquired the unique car, which he used at different racing events and historical races like the Mille Miglia. On the circuit, the single took part only in a well-known race, on 5 October 1958, at the Coupes du Salon, where it won the class in the class up to 2000 cc. The vehicle was acquired by an American collector.

The Ace Bristol Zagato was fitted with a modified Bristol six-cylinder engine with 130 hp at 5750 rpm, torque 174 Nm at 4500 rpm, length , height , ready-to-run weight , top speed , Acceleration from zero to 60 miles per hour in 7.7 seconds, to 100 miles per hour in 16.1 seconds.

The &#x27;AC Ace-Aigle&#x27; was an aerodynamically improved one-off AC Ace Bristol-based vehicle with the BEX289 chassis number designed specifically for the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1960. The inspiration came from the Swiss &quot;AC&quot; importer Hubert Patthey, as was the case with &#x27;AC Ace Bristol Zagato&#x27; in 1958, but was conceptually much easier. The Aigle Aigle, which has been legally independent in its own right alongside the design studio and car body builder Ghia in Turin existed. In contrast to the standard vehicle, the &#x27;Ace-Aigle&#x27; had a modified front and a fixed hardtop. The roof top had two unusual vaults to give the rider and co-driver plenty of headroom - actually the &quot;double bubble&quot; design, typical of Zagato, and implemented in its 1958 coupé. The normal, aerodynamically relatively unfavourable front body of radiator grille, front fenders and bonnet was replaced by a new front and made of lightweight polyester. This was rounder, ran longer and flatter forward, and had a flat, oval cooling air intake, backlit headlights clad with plexiglas half shells. It remotely recalled the Jaguar E-Type. According to the same concept and with very similar lines, &quot; Ghia Aigle &quot; had already changed several Austin-Healey Sprites from 1958 to 1961 (albeit without hardtop).

The &quot;Ace-Aigle&quot; was used by Swiss riders André Wicky and Georges Gachnang from the Swiss racing team Ecurie Lausannoise. It completed the Le Mans test in April 1960 as the fastest vehicle, but failed to finish the June 1960 race.

A very similar &quot;Ace Bristol&quot; with chassis number BEX1192 appeared in Le Mans in 1962, at the same time the last Le Mans appearance of an &quot;AC Ace&quot; before the &quot;AC Cobra&quot; from 1964 was used. The car of a French private owner suffered accident damage the previous year and had been returned to the &quot;AC&quot; factory, where it received a special lightweight body with an aerodynamically favourable front in the style of the &quot;Jaguar E-Type&quot; / &quot;Ace-Aigle&quot;. In the race, there was no clutch damage. The six-cylinder Bristol engine was optional until it ceased production in 1961.

Soon after, car dealer and racing driver Ken Rudd fitted his own competition Ace with a pre-war BMW-designed, Bristol-produced six-cylinder engine. This combination was put into production as the AC Ace-Bristol in 1957. In this form, the car raced at Le Mans in 1957 and 1958.

There is also in existence an AC Aceca fitted with a Bristol six-cylinder engine. One prototype labelled as drawing number &quot;A86&quot; was made in 1959. This Aceca-Bristol had a wider body and was built on a coil-sprung chassis similar to the AC Greyhound. Also, there exists a prototype with chassis number RS 5000, featuring the standard Ace body work.

The production model of the AC Ace 2.6 (as it was later known) is for many people the prettiest Ace of all—and undoubtedly the rarest, with only 36 such cars built. To fit the Zephyr engine, AC had to modify the frame, relocate the steering box and completely change the nose of the car. These changes are often mistakenly attributed to Carroll Shelby. Prototype chassis number RS 5500 featured the standard Ace body work. Its production model, the RS 5501-5507 (as later known) is one of the rarest models, with only 7 such cars built.

In September 1961, AC was approached by Carroll Shelby to use a small block Ford Windsor V8 engine in the Ace chassis, producing the AC Cobra. Shelby needed a car that could compete with the Chevrolet Corvette in US sports car racing. Only a single example was built (CSX 2000) using a Ford 221 Windsor V8. It debuted in 1962 with a Ford 260 V8 engine. This was then superseded by the Ford 289 V8 engine.

The resulting Cobra was a very powerful roadster, and it is commonly blamed for the introduction of the limit on British motorways. While this was a major factor in the decision, after a coupe version was caught doing during a test run, a then-recent spate of accidents under foggy conditions also helped the introduction of the limit. Its European model was branded with the AC brand.

At the end of the 1964 racing season, the Cobra was being outclassed in sports car racing by Ferrari. Carroll Shelby decided he needed a bigger engine. A big block Ford FE series 390 V8 was installed in a Cobra but it was over-powered and the car was now almost undrivable. It was decided that a completely new chassis was needed. With the combined help of Ford&#x27;s computers and the experience of the AC engineers, the new MKIII was born with main tubes instead of ones for the chassis, adding huge cross-braced shock towers and coil springs all around. In 1965 a competition version with a stripped interior, no glove box, different instrument layout and revised suspension was introduced. The competition version also had a more powerful motor with only one carburettor, side exhausts, a roll bar and wider fenders to accommodate racing tires. The engine that was installed in the car was Ford&#x27;s famed 427 FE NASCAR &quot;Side-Oiler&quot; V8, a power-house engine developing in its mildest street version.

Unfortunately, the car missed homologation for the 1965 season and was not raced by the Shelby team. However, it was raced successfully by many privateers and went on to win races all the way into the 1970s.
At the end of 1966, Shelby was left with 31 unsold competition cars; it was decided by Shelby American to sell them to the general public under the name of Cobra 427 S/C or Semi-Competition. These S/C cars have become the most sought after models and can sell in excess of 1.5 million dollars.

In 1966 a street model of the 427 S/C was made available. It came with a tamer motor, optional dual carburetors, a glove box, and exhaust running under the car. Meanwhile, AC went on producing a milder version of the 427 MK III Cobra for the European market fitted with the small block Ford motor. The car was called the AC 289 and 27 were produced. Carroll Shelby sold the Cobra name to Ford in 1965 and went on to help develop the famed racing Ford GT40.

At the same time, the company realized they needed a grand tourer model that could appeal to wealthy customers. AC contacted the famed Italian coach builder Pietro Frua to design an appealing GT body that could be fitted on a MKIII Cobra chassis stretched by . The new car was shown at the 1965 Turin show. A few early models were fitted with the famed 427 Ford FE motors. In 1967 the long-stroked 428 motor became available and the car was known as the AC Frua. Built out of steel rather than AC&#x27;s usual aluminium, the Frua is heavier than a Cobra at slightly under . That said, it is still a light and very fast automobile built on a racing chassis. The car was never fully developed and the cost of sending chassis from England to Italy and back for final assembly made it so expensive that only a few were produced. Production ended in 1973 after only 80 cars (29 convertibles and 51 coupes) were finished.

In 1970, a special version of the coupé was built. It was based on an extended bodyshell that Frua built for Monteverdi which was supposed to become the second &quot;Monteverdi 375/L&quot; (Monteverdi chassis# 2002). After the alliance between Monteverdi and Frua broke apart in Summer 1969, that bodyshell remained in the Frua works in Turin. A year or so later Frua changed some details on front and rear, including some semi-hidden headlamps similar to those seen on the &quot;Iso Lele&quot; and the second series &quot;Iso Grifo&quot; before. The car was called AC 429; it remained a one-off.


The 1970s were not a good period for luxury car manufacturers and Derek Hurlock went searching for a totally new, smaller car. Mid-engined designs were in fashion at the time and in 1972 the Diablo, a prototype with an Austin Maxi engine and transaxle, was built by privateers Peter Bohanna and Robin Stables.

In much the same way as they had taken up the Tojeiro prototype and turned it into the Ace, AC acquired the rights and at the 1973 London Motor Show showed their own version, the mid-engined ME3000 with the 3.0-litre Ford Essex V6 engine installed transversely over a bespoke AC-designed gearbox. Development was virtually complete in 1976 when new Type Approval regulations were introduced. A prototype failed the crash test, and the chassis had to be redesigned. On the second attempt, the car passed with flying colours. This was a huge achievement for a tiny firm — Vauxhall had to make several attempts before the contemporary Chevette passed. For AC, such delays meant that the first production cars (later renamed 3000ME) were not delivered until 1979, by which time they were in direct competition with the Lotus Esprit. Although comfortable, brisk, nicely built and practical, the car&#x27;s handling was heavily criticised by writers from Car Magazine, Autocar and Motor. AC&#x27;s ambitions of selling 250 cars per year were a distant memory. After just 71 cars were sold, Hurlock called a halt to production as his health was suffering and the company was struggling in the teeth of a recession. In 1984, production stopped at Thames Ditton and the car and the AC name were licensed to a new company registered as AC (Scotland) plc run by David McDonald in a new factory in Hillington, Glasgow. Here, 30 cars were built, including a development car tested with Alfa Romeo&#x27;s 2.5-litre V6 engine and a nearly complete Mark 2 prototype of the same. Regardless (or possibly because) of these developments, AC Scotland called in the receivers in 1985.
=== Dissolution of the company ===
After selling the historic High Street works for redevelopment, AC themselves soldiered on as a service operation in the &quot;21st Century&quot; works on Summer Road until the Hurlock family finally sold their holdings in 1986 to William West.

After some complex machinations, the company was split between property interests and the car brand; the former was renamed and the latter was acquired by C.P.Autokraft&#x27;s owner, Brian Angliss.

=== Autokraft name acquisition ===
In 1982, Brian Angliss was running Autokraft, a Cobra restoration shop, parts supplier and replica manufacturer. To further such pursuits, he acquired some of the tooling from Thames Ditton and created the MKIV; the car had US-spec bumpers, a US-regulations compliant motor, and a larger interior with modern switchgear. About 480 cars were produced in his factory at Brooklands. He also produced a lightweight model which was more in tune with the original Cobra spirit, though it could not be exported to the US owing to federal regulations.

Early cars were sold as the Autokraft MKIV, but eventually Angliss acquired the rights to use the AC name. Derek Hurlock had been strongly protective of the name, but Angliss&#x27; high standards of craftsmanship won him over. When the Hurlock family finally sold up in 1986 Angliss fully acquired the AC trademark rights and set up a new AC company as a joint venture with Ford, who had also recently bought Aston Martin. A big conflict followed over the future direction for AC, but Angliss eventually won his independence as well as Ford&#x27;s continuing and essential cooperation as an engine and parts supplier.

Also interested in aircraft, Angliss restored a Hawker Hurricane XIIB at Brooklands as well as acquiring two ex–Indian Air Force Hawker Tempest IIs as future projects. The Hurricane was registered as G-HURR and was destroyed in a fatal accident at the Shoreham air show in 2007.

Angliss looked for a new car to complement and perhaps replace the MKIV. At the 1993 London Motor Show, he introduced a new vehicle that he named the AC Ace. It was a modern automobile with a stainless steel chassis and an aluminium body, but was expensive to develop and build. The costs hit Angliss hard and he sold his large motor bike collection, vintage Bentley and other assets to try to make ends meet. The receivers were called in by 1996 after approximately 50 &quot;new&quot; Aces had been built.

=== AC Car Group Ltd. ===
In March 1996, largely due to the cost of developing the new Ace, Angliss&#x27; company went into receivership and was eventually sold to South African businessman Alan Lubinsky in December 1996, who continued car production in Weybridge, Surrey, under the name of AC Car Group Ltd.

Both the Cobra Mk IV and the Ace were made, and soon a &#x27;CRS&#x27; version of the Mk IV was announced with a carbon fibre body shell, a 212 S/C version with Lotus twin-turbo V8 power, as well as the AC Superblower with a supercharger Ford V8. Two Aceca coupes (enclosed version of the Ace) were also made.

=== AC Motor Holdings Ltd. ===
In August 2002, AC Motor Holdings Ltd. was incorporated in Malta.

In 2003, Carroll Shelby International and AC Motor Holdings Ltd. announced the production of an authentic Shelby/AC Cobra, with the production vehicle arriving at dealers in July 2004. Initial models included Shelby AC 427 S/C Cobra and Shelby AC 289 FIA Cobra, which were branded as the CSX 1000 and CSX 7500 Series, respectively. In February 2004, the first handcrafted aluminium body shell was built at Frimley works.

In 2004, a new manufacturing plant was opened in Malta and production of the carbon-fibre-bodied AC MkV began. Due to problems with the factory building, production ceased in 2007.

=== Acedes Holdings LLC ===
In August 2008, Acedes Holdings LLC was incorporated in St Kitts.

In 2008, AC announced a joint venture with Brooklands Motor Company (the spiritual successor of Autokraft) in Weybridge, Surrey, and confirmed plans for the continuation of the traditional AC designed tubular chassis and aluminium-bodied models.&lt;ref name=&quot;acheritage.co.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, a joint venture in Germany was announced to manufacture the new AC MKVI. Following a supply deal with GM, the AC MKVI had a novel spaceframe chassis, 6.2-litre V8 engine and 6-speed manual transmission, and new Corvette brakes, retaining the original shape in lightweight composite material with the moulds taken from an original AC MKIII body. The car went into series production in July 2012 after two years of intense prototyping and development.

In 2010, AC announced a joint venture with the USA-based company Iconic which resulted in the design of the ultimate &quot;Cobra&quot;: the &quot;Iconic AC Roadster&quot;.

At the Geneva Motor Show in 2012, AC Cars showed three different models: the AC MK VI, AC MK II Classic, and AC 378 GT Zagato.

In 2020, AC Cars announced that they would be building a zero-emission version of the Cobra called the Series 1 Electric. Fifty-eight of these electric sports cars will be built alongside a 2.3-litre petrol version called the AC Cobra 140 Charter Edition.

In 2022, the new corporate structure began the production of 663 new AC Cobra models, with a slightly modified structure to adapt it to modern safety and technology requirements and obtain the European road homologation certificate.

== Trains and railbuses ==

In 1949, AC Cars produced four trains, each consisting three power cars and four coaches, for the Southend Pier Railway in Essex. These remained in use until 1976.
The company also ventured briefly into the railway rolling stock business, building five four-wheel railbuses for British Rail in 1958.

<doc id="146416" wikidata="Q214820" url="?curid=146416" title="Whitehall">
<text>Whitehall is a road and area in the City of Westminster, Central London, England. The road forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea. It is the main thoroughfare running south from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The street is recognised as the centre of the Government of the United Kingdom and is lined with numerous departments and ministries, including the Ministry of Defence, Horse Guards, the Cabinet Office, and much of the Foreign Office. Consequently, the name &quot;Whitehall&quot; is used as a metonym for the British civil service and government, and as the geographic name for the surrounding area.

The Palace of Whitehall previously occupied the area and was the residence of Kings Henry VIII through to William III, before it was destroyed by fire in 1698; only the Banqueting House has survived. Whitehall was originally a wide road that led to the gates of the palace; the route to the south was widened in the 18th century, following the destruction of the palace, and the area was largely rebuilt for government offices.

As well as government buildings, the street is known for its memorial statues and monuments, including the UK&#x27;s primary war memorial, the Cenotaph. South of the Cenotaph the thoroughfare becomes &quot;Parliament Street.&quot; The Whitehall Theatre (now the Trafalgar Studios) was formerly associated with a series of farces.

== Geography and name ==
The name Whitehall was used for several buildings in the Tudor period. It either referred to a building made of light stone, or as a general term for any festival building. This included the Royal Palace of Whitehall, which in turn gave its name to the street.

The street is about long and runs through the City of Westminster. It is part of the A3212, a main road in Central London that leads towards Chelsea via the Houses of Parliament and Vauxhall Bridge. It runs south from Trafalgar Square, past numerous government buildings, including the old War Office building, Horse Guards, the Ministry of Defence, the Cabinet Office, and the Department of Health. It ends at the Cenotaph, the road ahead being Parliament Street. Great Scotland Yard and Horse Guards Avenue branch off to the east, while Downing Street branches off to the west at the southern section of the street.

The nearest tube stations are Charing Cross at the north end, and Westminster at the south. Numerous London bus routes run along Whitehall, including 12, 24, 88, 159 and 453.

== History ==

There has been a route connecting Charing Cross to Westminster since the Middle Ages; the 12th-century historian William Fitzstephen described it as &quot;a continued suburb, mingled with large and beautiful gardens, and orchards belonging to the citizens&quot;. The name Whitehall was originally only used for the section of road between Charing Cross and Holbein Gate; beyond this it was known as The Street as far as King Street Gate, then King Street thereafter. It had become a residential street by the 16th century, and had become a popular place to live by the 17th, with residents including Lord Howard of Effingham and Edmund Spenser.

The Palace of Whitehall, to the east of the road, was originally named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. The palace was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King&#x27;s main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at the palace in 1547. Charles I owned an extensive art collection at the palace and several of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays had their first performances here. It ceased to be the royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace for his health to escape what had become dense urban surroundings. The palace was damaged by fire in 1691, following which the front entrance was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of the vast palace burned to the ground accidentally after a fire started by a careless washerwoman.

Wallingford House was constructed in 1572 by William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury along the western edge of Whitehall. The Duke of Buckingham bought the house in 1622, and it was subsequently used by Charles I. During the reign of William III, it was bought for the Admiralty. The Old Admiralty Buildings now sit on the house&#x27;s site.
Banqueting House was built as an extension to the Palace of Whitehall in 1622 by Inigo Jones. It is the only surviving portion of the palace after it was burned down, and was the first Renaissance building in London. It later became a museum to the Royal United Services Institute and has been opened to the public since 1963.

Oliver Cromwell moved to the street in 1647, taking up residence in Wallingford House. Two years later, Charles I was carried through Whitehall on the way to his trial at Westminster Hall. Whitehall itself was a wide street and had sufficient space for a scaffold to be erected for the King&#x27;s execution at Banqueting House. He made a brief speech there before being beheaded. Cromwell died at the Palace of Whitehall in 1658.

During the Great Plague of London in 1665, people boarded coaches at Whitehall, then at the edge of urban London, in an attempt to escape. The King and court temporarily moved to Oxford to avoid the plague, while Samuel Pepys remarked in his diary on 29 June, &quot;By water to Whitehall, where the Court is full of waggons and people ready to go out of town. This end of town every day grows very bad with plague&quot;.

By the 18th century, traffic was struggling along the narrow streets south of Holbein Gate, which led to King Street Gate being demolished in 1723. Holbein Gate, in turn, was demolished in 1759. Meanwhile, Parliament Street was a side road alongside the palace, leading to the Palace of Westminster. After the Palace of Whitehall was destroyed, Parliament Street was widened to match Whitehall&#x27;s width. The present appearance of the street dates from 1899 after a group of houses between Downing Street and Great George Street were destroyed.

On 8 March 1973, the IRA detonated a bomb in front of the Ministry of Agriculture building in Whitehall, injuring a number of bystanders. On 7 February 1991, the IRA launched a mortar attack on 10 Downing Street in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Prime Minister John Major and his cabinet.

== Government buildings ==

By the time the palace was destroyed, separation of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws. The government wanted to be some distance from the monarch, and the buildings around Whitehall, physically separated from St James&#x27;s Palace by St James&#x27;s Park, seemed to be a good place for ministers to work.

The Horse Guards building was designed by William Kent, and built during the 1750s on a former tiltyard site, replacing an earlier guard-house erected during the Civil War. The building includes an archway for coach traffic and two pedestrian arches that provide access between Whitehall and Horse Guards Parade. The central archway is marked with &quot;SMF&quot; and &quot;StMW&quot;, and denotes the boundary between St Martin-in-the-Fields and St Margaret&#x27;s church parish boundaries.

During the 19th century, as private leases ran out on residential buildings, ownership reverted to the Crown, which began to use them as public offices. The name &quot;Whitehall&quot; is now used as a metonym to refer to that part of the civil service which is involved in the government of the United Kingdom. The street&#x27;s central portion is dominated by military buildings, including the Ministry of Defence, with the former headquarters of the British Army and Royal Navy, the Royal United Services Institute, the Horse Guards building and the Admiralty, on the opposite side. Government buildings on Whitehall, from north to south, include The Admiralty Buildings, the Department for International Development at No. 22, the Department of Energy and Climate Change at No. 55, the Old War Office, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel at No. 36, the Horse Guards, the Ministry of Defence Main Building, Dover House (containing the Scotland Office), Gwydyr House (containing the Wales Office), the Cabinet Office at No. 70, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Government Offices Great George Street (HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and parts of the Cabinet Office).
Scotland Yard, the headquarters of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service, was originally located in Great Scotland Yard off the north-eastern end of Whitehall. The buildings had been lodgings for the Kings of Scotland, on part of the old Palace of Whitehall&#x27;s grounds; by the 19th century, Little and Middle Scotland Yard had been merged into Whitehall Place, leaving only Great Scotland Yard. No. 4 Whitehall Place had become vacant by the 1820s, which allowed Sir Robert Peel to use it as the main headquarters when forming the police in 1829. It was formally named the Metropolitan Police Office, but became quickly known as Great Scotland Yard, and eventually Scotland Yard. The buildings were damaged in a series of bombings by Irish nationalists in 1883, and an explosion from a Fenian terrorist attack on 30 May 1884 blew a hole in Scotland Yard&#x27;s outer wall and destroyed the neighbouring Rising Sun pub. The headquarters was moved away from Whitehall in 1890.

Downing Street leads off the south-west end of Whitehall, just above Parliament Street. It was named after Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was closed to the public in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No. 10, one of which exploded in the gardens.

Additional security measures have been put in place along Whitehall to protect government buildings, following a £25 million streetscape project undertaken by Westminster City Council. The project has provided wider pavements and better lighting, along with installing hundreds of concrete and steel security barriers.

Richmond House, at No. 79, has held the Department of Health since 1987. The building is scheduled to be a temporary debating chamber from 2025, while the Houses of Parliament undergo a refurbishment and modernisation programme.

== Memorials ==

Statues and memorials have been built on and around Whitehall, commemorating military victories and leaders. The Cenotaph was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and erected at the southern end in 1919, commemorating victory in World War I and later used as a memorial for both World Wars. It is the main war memorial in Britain and an annual service is held here on Remembrance Sunday, led by the reigning monarch and leading politicians. In 2005, a national Monument to the Women of World War II was erected a short distance north of the Cenotaph in the middle of the Whitehall carriageway.

The Royal Tank Regiment Memorial is at the north east end of Whitehall, where Whitehall Court meets Whitehall Place. Erected in 2000, it commemorates the use of tanks in both World Wars and depicts five World War II tank crew members. The Gurkha Memorial is to the south of this, on Horse Guards Avenue to the east of Whitehall.

Whitehall is also home to six other monuments. From north to south, these are of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge (Commander-in-Chief of the British Army), Liberal Party, Liberal Unionist Party and Unionists leader Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire, Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig (known as the Earl Haig Memorial), Field Marshal Montgomery (commander of the 8th Army, the 21st Army Group and Chief of the Imperial General Staff), William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim, Commander of the 14th Army and Governor-General of Australia, and Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

== Culture ==

The Whitehall Theatre opened in 1930 at the north west end of the street, on a site that had previously been Ye Old Ship Tavern in the 17th century. The revue &quot;Whitehall Follies&quot; opened in 1942, which drew controversy over its explicit content featuring the stripper and actress Phyllis Dixey. The theatre became known for its series of farces, reviving a tradition on Whitehall that had begun with court jesters at the palace during the 16th century; these included several plays featuring actor-manager Brian Rix throughout the 1950s and &#x27;60s, and 1981&#x27;s satirical &quot;Anyone for Denis&quot;, written by John Wells and &quot;Private Eye&quot; editor Richard Ingrams. The venue was Grade II listed in 1996 and renamed the Trafalgar Studios in 2004.

Because of its importance as the centre of the British government, several political comedies are based in and around Whitehall. These include the BBC television series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;The Thick of It&quot;.

Whitehall is one of three purple squares on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board, along with Pall Mall and Northumberland Avenue. All three streets converge at Trafalgar Square.

<text>Erró (born Guðmundur Guðmundsson in 1932 in Ólafsvík, Iceland) is a visual artist and painter, who is best known for his painted pop art collages of images from comic books and advertisements. He lives in France and Spain.

He was previously married to Myriam Bat-Yosef.

==Career==
Erró studied art in Norway and in Italy, and has resided in Paris, Thailand, and on the island of Formentera for most of his life. In 1989 he donated a large collection of his works to the Reykjavik Arts Museum, which has put part of it on permanent display and opened a website where the whole collection can be visited.

An exhibition of his work, &quot;Variations on Animation,&quot; was presented by Galérie Louis Carré at Louis Stern Fine Arts in conjunction with the 2003 Los Angeles International Biennial. A major retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lyon (France) in 2015.

In 2010 he was accused of plagiarism by Brian Bolland for copying his work uncredited and selling it.

<doc id="146428" wikidata="Q283774" url="?curid=146428" title="Rsync">
<text>rsync (remote sync) is a utility for transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and a storage drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification times and sizes of files. It is commonly found on Unix-like operating systems and is under the GPL-3.0-or-later license.

rsync is written in C as a single-threaded application. The rsync algorithm is a type of delta encoding, and is used for minimizing network usage. Zstandard, LZ4, or Zlib may be used for additional data compression, and SSH or stunnel can be used for security.

rsync is typically used for synchronizing files and directories between two different systems. For example, if the command codice_1 is run, rsync will use SSH to connect as codice_2 to codice_3. Once connected, it will invoke the remote host&#x27;s rsync and then the two programs will determine what parts of the local file need to be transferred so that the remote file matches the local one. One application of rsync is the synchronization of software repositories on mirror sites used by package management systems.

rsync can also operate in a daemon mode (rsyncd), serving and receiving files in the native rsync protocol (using the codice_4 syntax).

== History ==
Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras wrote the original rsync, which was first announced on 19 June 1996. It is similar in function and invocation to rdist (codice_5), created by Ralph Campbell in 1983 and released as part of 4.3BSD. Tridgell discusses the design, implementation, and performance of rsync in chapters 3 through 5 of his 1999 Ph.D. thesis. , it is maintained by Wayne Davison.

Because of its flexibility, speed, and scriptability, codice_6 has become a standard Linux utility, included in all popular Linux distributions. It has been ported to Windows (via Cygwin, Grsync, or SFU), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS.

== Use ==
Similar to codice_7, codice_8 and codice_9, codice_6 requires the specification of a source and a destination, of which at least one must be local.

Generic syntax:

rsync [OPTION] … SRC … [USER@]HOST:DEST
rsync [OPTION] … [USER@]HOST:SRC [DEST]
where is the file or directory (or a list of multiple files and directories) to copy from, is the file or directory to copy to, and square brackets indicate optional parameters.

codice_6 can synchronize Unix clients to a central Unix server using codice_6/codice_13 and standard Unix accounts. It can be used in desktop environments, for example to efficiently synchronize files with a backup copy on an external hard drive. A scheduling utility such as codice_14 can carry out tasks such as automated encrypted codice_6-based mirroring between multiple hosts and a central server.

== Examples ==
A command line to mirror FreeBSD might look like:
$ rsync -avz --delete ftp4.de.FreeBSD.org::FreeBSD/ /pub/FreeBSD/
The Apache HTTP Server supports rsync only for updating mirrors.
$ rsync -avz --delete --safe-links rsync.apache.org::apache-dist /path/to/mirror
The preferred (and simplest) way to mirror a PuTTY website to the current directory is to use rsync.
$ rsync -auH rsync://rsync.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ftp/users/sgtatham/putty-website-mirror/ .
A way to mimic the capabilities of Time Machine (macOS);
$ date=$(date &quot;+%FT%H-%M-%S&quot;) # rsync interprets &quot;:&quot; as separator between host and port (i.e. host:port), so we cannot use %T or %H:%M:%S here, so we use %H-%M-%S
$ rsync -aP --link-dest=$HOME/Backups/current /path/to/important_files $HOME/Backups/back-$date
$ ln -nfs $HOME/Backups/back-$date $HOME/Backups/current

Make a full backup of system root directory:

$ rsync -avAXHS --progress --exclude={&quot;/dev/*&quot;,&quot;/proc/*&quot;,&quot;/sys/*&quot;,&quot;/tmp/*&quot;,&quot;/run/*&quot;,&quot;/mnt/*&quot;,&quot;/media/*&quot;,&quot;/lost+found&quot;} / /path/to/backup/folder 
Delete all files and directories, within a directory, extremely fast:

# Make an empty directory somewhere, which is the first path, and the second path is the directory you want to empty.
$ rsync -a --delete /path/to/empty/dir /path/to/dir/to/empty
== Connection ==
An rsync process operates by communicating with another rsync process, a sender and a receiver. At startup, an rsync client connects to a peer process. If the transfer is local (that is, between file systems mounted on the same host) the peer can be created with fork, after setting up suitable pipes for the connection. If a remote host is involved, rsync starts a process to handle the connection, typically Secure Shell. Upon connection, a command is issued to start an rsync process on the remote host, which uses the connection thus established. As an alternative, if the remote host runs an rsync daemon, rsync clients can connect by opening a socket on TCP port 873, possibly using a proxy.

Rsync has numerous command line options and configuration files to specify alternative shells, options, commands, possibly with full path, and port numbers. Besides using remote shells, tunnelling can be used to have remote ports appear as local on the server where an rsync daemon runs. Those possibilities allow adjusting security levels to the state of the art, while a naive rsync daemon can be enough for a local network.

One solution is the codice_16 option, which allows users to validate their command-line arguments and to simulate what would happen when copying the data without actually making any changes or transferring any data.

== Algorithm ==
=== Determining which files to send ===
By default, rsync determines which files differ between the sending and receiving systems by checking the modification time and size of each file. If time or size is different between the systems, it transfers the file from the sending to the receiving system. As this only requires reading file directory information, it is quick, but it will miss unusual modifications which change neither.

Rsync performs a slower but comprehensive check if invoked with codice_17. This forces a full checksum comparison on every file present on both systems. Barring rare checksum collisions, this avoids the risk of missing changed files at the cost of reading every file present on both systems.

=== Determining which parts of a file have changed ===
The rsync utility uses an algorithm invented by Australian computer programmer Andrew Tridgell for efficiently transmitting a structure (such as a file) across a communications link when the receiving computer already has a similar, but not identical, version of the same structure.

The recipient splits its copy of the file into chunks and computes two checksums for each chunk: the MD5 hash, and a weaker but easier to compute &#x27;rolling checksum&#x27;. It sends these checksums to the sender.

The sender computes the checksum for each rolling section in its version of the file having the same size as the chunks used by the recipient&#x27;s. While the recipient calculates the checksum only for chunks starting at full multiples of the chunk size, the sender calculates the checksum for all sections starting at any address. If any such rolling checksum calculated by the sender matches a checksum calculated by the recipient, then this section is a candidate for not transmitting the content of the section, but only the location in the recipient&#x27;s file instead. In this case, the sender uses the more computationally expensive MD5 hash to verify that the sender&#x27;s section and recipient&#x27;s chunk are equal. Note that the section in the sender may not be at the same start address as the chunk at the recipient. This allows efficient transmission of files which differ by insertions and deletions. The sender then sends the recipient those parts of its file that did not match, along with information on where to merge existing blocks into the recipient&#x27;s version. This makes the copies identical.

The rolling checksum used in rsync is based on Mark Adler&#x27;s adler-32 checksum, which is used in zlib, and is itself based on Fletcher&#x27;s checksum.

If the sender&#x27;s and recipient&#x27;s versions of the file have many sections in common, the utility needs to transfer relatively little data to synchronize the files. If typical data compression algorithms are used, files that are similar when uncompressed may be very different when compressed, and thus the entire file will need to be transferred. Some compression programs, such as gzip, provide a special &quot;rsyncable&quot; mode which allows these files to be efficiently rsynced, by ensuring that local changes in the uncompressed file yield only local changes in the compressed file.

Rsync supports other key features that aid significantly in data transfers or backup. They include compression and decompression of data block by block using Zstandard, LZ4, or zlib, and support for protocols such as ssh and stunnel.

== Variations ==
The utility uses the rsync algorithm to generate delta files with the difference from file A to file B (like the utility diff, but in a different delta format). The delta file can then be applied to file A, turning it into file B (similar to the patch utility). rdiff works well with binary files.

The rdiff-backup script maintains a backup mirror of a file or directory either locally or remotely over the network on another server. rdiff-backup stores incremental rdiff deltas with the backup, with which it is possible to recreate any backup point.

The librsync library used by rdiff is an independent implementation of the rsync algorithm. It does not use the rsync network protocol and does not share any code with the rsync application. It is used by Dropbox, rdiff-backup, duplicity, and other utilities.

The acrosync library is an independent, cross-platform implementation of the rsync network protocol. Unlike librsync, it is wire-compatible with rsync (protocol version 29 or 30). It is released under the Reciprocal Public License and used by the commercial rsync software Acrosync.

The duplicity backup software written in python allows for incremental backups with simple storage backend services like local file system, sftp, Amazon S3 and many others. It utilizes librsync to generate delta data against signatures of the previous file versions, encrypting them using gpg, and storing them on the backend. For performance reasons a local archive-dir is used to cache backup chain signatures, but can be re-downloaded from the backend if needed.

As of macOS 10.5 and later, there is a special codice_18 or codice_19 switch which allows retaining much of the HFS+ file metadata when syncing between two machines supporting this feature. This is achieved by transmitting the Resource Fork along with the Data Fork.

zsync is an rsync-like tool optimized for many downloads per file version. zsync is used by Linux distributions such as Ubuntu for distributing fast changing beta ISO image files. zsync uses the HTTP protocol and .zsync files with pre-calculated rolling hash to minimize server load yet permit diff transfer for network optimization.

Rclone is an open-source tool inspired by rsync that focuses on cloud and other high latency storage. It supports more than 50 different providers and provides an rsync-like interface for cloud storage. However, Rclone does not support rolling checksums for partial file syncing (binary diffs) because cloud storage providers do not usually offer the feature and Rclone avoids storing additional metadata.

<doc id="146442" wikidata="Q7991837" url="?curid=146442" title="Wheat mildew">
<text>Wheat mildew is a wheat disease that affects the ear, and is brought on by causes somewhat similar to those that cause blight, though at a more advanced period of the season. If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected—but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible. Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the &quot;gum&quot;, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting. 

Another disorder that affects wheat is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived. 

Some people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and incapable of withstanding winter blasts.

<doc id="146444" wikidata="Q16894648" url="?curid=146444" title="Opabinia">
<text>Opabinia regalis is an extinct, stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte (505 million years ago) of British Columbia. &quot;Opabinia&quot; was a soft-bodied animal, measuring up to 7 cm in body length, and had a segmented trunk with flaps along its sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head showed unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a clawed proboscis that most likely passed food to its mouth. &quot;Opabinia&quot; lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of &quot;Opabinia&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community.

When the first thorough examination of &quot;Opabinia&quot; in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, or perhaps a relative of arthropod and annelid ancestors. However, later studies since late 1990s consistently support its affinity as a member of basal arthropods, alongside the closely related radiodonts (&quot;Anomalocaris&quot; and relatives) and gilled lobopodians (&quot;Kerygmachela&quot; and &quot;Pambdelurion&quot;).

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first &quot;Opabinia&quot; was regarded as strong evidence for the &quot;explosive&quot; hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopodian animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups, suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution, but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.

== History of discovery ==

In 1911, Charles Doolittle Walcott found in the Burgess Shale nine almost complete fossils of &quot;Opabinia regalis&quot; and a few of what he classified as &quot;Opabinia ? media&quot;, and published a description of all of these in 1912. The generic name is derived from Opabin pass between Mount Hungabee and Mount Biddle, southeast of Lake O&#x27;Hara, British Columbia, Canada. In 1966–1967, Harry B. Whittington found another good specimen, and in 1975 he published a detailed description based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles. Whittington&#x27;s analysis did not cover &quot;Opabinia ? media&quot;; Walcott&#x27;s specimens of this species could not be identified in his collection. In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they found in the Norilsk region of Siberia and labelled &quot;Opabinia norilica&quot;, but these fossils were poorly preserved, and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus &quot;Opabinia&quot;.

== Occurrence ==

All the recognized &quot;Opabinia&quot; specimens found so far come from the &quot;Phyllopod bed&quot; of the Burgess Shale, in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia.

In 1997, Briggs and Nedin reported from South Australia Emu Bay Shale a new specimen of &quot;Myoscolex&quot; that was much better preserved than previous specimens, leading them to conclude that it was a close relative of &quot;Opabinia&quot;—although this interpretation was later questioned by Dzik, who instead concluded that &quot;Myoscolex&quot; was an annelid worm.

== Morphology ==

&quot;Opabinia&quot; looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington&#x27;s analysis laughed. The length of &quot;Opabinia regalis&quot; from head (excluding proboscis) to tail end ranged between and . One of the most distinctive characters of &quot;Opabinia&quot; is the hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third that of the body, and projected down from under the head. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner&#x27;s hose and flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose terminal edges bore 5 spines that projected inwards and forwards. The bilateral symmetry and lateral (instead of vertical as reconstructed by Whittington 1975) arrangement of the claw suggest it represents a pair of fused frontal appendages, comparable to those of radiodonts and gilled lobopodians. The head bore five stalked eyes: two near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes with longer stalks near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like other arthropods&#x27; lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is &quot;somewhat fanciful&quot;. The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed &quot;backwards&quot;, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appears to have been sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.

The main part of the body was typically about wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of flaps (lobes) pointing downwards and outwards. The flaps overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping tail fan blades that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.

Interpretations of other features of &quot;Opabinia&quot; fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of other arthropods, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.

Whittington (1975) interpreted the gills as paired extensions attached dorsally to the bases of all but the first flaps on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top. Bergström (1986) revealed the &quot;overlapping layers&quot; were rows of individual blades, interpreted the flaps as part of dorsal coverings (tergite) over the upper surface of the body, with blades attached underneath each of them. Budd (1996) thought the gill blades attached along the front edges on the dorsal side of all except the first flaps. He also found marks inside the flaps&#x27; front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. Zhang and Briggs (2007) however, interpreted all flaps have posterior spacing where the gill blades attached. Budd and Daley (2011) reject the reconstruction by Zhang &amp; Briggs, showing the flaps have complete posterior edges as in previous reconstructions. They mostly follow the reconstruction by Budd (1996) with modifications on some details (e.g. the first flap pair also have gills; the attachment point of gill blades located more posteriorly than previously thought).
Whittington (1975) found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut (diverticula). Chen &quot;et al.&quot; (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd (1996) thought the &quot;triangles&quot; were too wide to fit within &quot;Opabinia&quot;″s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs&#x27; exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the &quot;triangles&quot; as short, fleshy, conical legs (lobopods). He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Under this reconstruction, the gill-bearing flap and lobopod were homologized to the outer gill branch and inner leg branch of arthropod biramous limbs seen in &quot;Marrella&quot;, trilobites, and crustaceans. Zhang and Briggs (2007) analyzed the chemical composition of the &quot;triangles&quot;, and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded &quot;Opabinia&quot;″s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the arthropod limbs before it split into a biramous structure. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley (2011) suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body, which is consistent with hollow lobopods as seen in unequivocal lobopodian fossils. They also clarify that the gut diverticula of &quot;Opabinia&quot; are series of circular gut glands individualized from the &quot;triangles&quot;. While they agreed on the absence of terminal claws, the presence of lobopods in &quot;Opabinia&quot; remain as a plausible interpretation.

== Lifestyle ==

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. &quot;Opabinia&quot; probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. The paired gut diverticula may increase the efficiency of food digestion and intake of nutrition. Whittington (1975) believing that &quot;Opabinia&quot; had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create a wave with the metachronal movement of its lobes. On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.

==Classification==

Considering how paleontologists&#x27; reconstructions of &quot;Opabinia&quot; differ, it is not surprising that the animal&#x27;s classification was highly debated during the 20th century. Charles Doolittle Walcott, the original , considered it to be an anostracan crustacean in 1912. The idea was followed by G. Evelyn Hutchinson in 1930, providing the first reconstruction of &quot;Opabinia&quot; as an anostracan swimming upside down. Alberto Simonetta provided a new reconstruction of &quot;Opabinia&quot; in 1970 very different to those of Hutchinson&#x27;s, with lots of arthropod features (&quot;e.g. ,&quot;dorsal exoskeleton and jointed limbs) which are reminiscent of &quot;Yohoia&quot; and &quot;Leanchoilia&quot;. Leif Størmer, following earlier work by Percy Raymond, thought that &quot;Opabinia&quot; belonged to the so-called &quot;trilobitoids&quot; (trilobites and similar taxa). After his thorough analysis Harry B. Whittington concluded that &quot;Opabinia&quot; was not arthropod in 1975, as he found no evidence for arthropodan jointed limbs, and that nothing like the flexible, probably fluid-filled, proboscis was known in arthropods. Although he left &quot;Opabinia&quot;&#x27;s classification above the family level open, the annulated but not articulated body and the unusual lateral flaps with gills persuaded him that it may have been a representative of the ancestral stock from the origin of annelids and arthropods, two distinct animal phyla (Lophotrochozoan and Ecdysozoan, respectively) which were still thought to be close relatives (united under Articulata) at that time.

In 1985, Derek Briggs and Whittington published a major redescription of &quot;Anomalocaris&quot;, also from the Burgess Shale. Soon after that, Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström, noting in 1986 the similarity of &quot;Anomalocaris&quot; and &quot;Opabinia&quot;, suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared numerous features (&quot;e.g.,&quot; lateral flaps, gill blades, stalked eyes, and specialized frontal appendages). He classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are not a single phylum.

In 1996, Graham Budd found what he considered evidence of short, un-jointed legs in &quot;Opabinia&quot;. His examination of the gilled lobopodian &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; from the Sirius Passet lagerstätte, about and over 10M years older than the Burgess Shale, convinced him that this specimen had similar legs. He considered the legs of these two genera very similar to those of the Burgess Shale lobopodian &quot;Aysheaia&quot; and the modern onychophorans (velvet worms), which are regarded as the bearers of numerous ancestral traits shared by the ancestors of arthropods. After examining several sets of features shared by these and similar lobopodians he drew up a &quot;broad-scale reconstruction of the arthropod stem-group&quot;, &quot;i.e.,&quot; of arthropods and what he considered to be their evolutionary basal members. One striking feature of this family tree is that modern tardigrades (water bears) may be &quot;Opabinia&#x27;&quot;s closest living evolutionary relatives. On the other hand, Hou &quot;et al.&quot; (1995, 2006) suggested &quot;Opabinia&quot; is a member of unusual cycloneuralian worms with convergent arthropod features.

Although Zhang and Briggs (2007) disagreed with Budd&#x27;s diagnosis that &quot;Opabinia&quot;″s &quot;triangles&quot; were legs, the resemblance they saw between &quot;Opabinia&quot;″s lobe+gill arrangement and arthropods&#x27; biramous limbs led them to conclude that &quot;Opabinia&quot; was very closely related to arthropods. In fact they presented a family tree very similar to Budd&#x27;s except that theirs did not mention tardigrades. Regardless of the different morphological interpretations, all major restudies since 1980s similarly concluded that the resemblance between &quot;Opabinia&quot; and arthropods (&quot;e.g.,&quot; stalked eyes, dorsal segmentation, posterior mouth, fused appendages, gill-like limb branches) are taxonomically significant.

Since the 2010s, the suggested close relationship between &quot;Opabinia&quot; and tardigrades/cycloneuralians is no longer supported, while the affinity of &quot;Opabinia&quot; as a stem-group arthropod alongside Radiodonta (a clade that includes &quot;Anomalocaris&quot; and its relatives) and gilled lobopodians is widely accepted, as consistently shown by multiple phylogenetic analyses, as well as new discoveries such as the presence of arthropod-like gut glands and the intermediate taxon &quot;Kylinxia&quot;.

In 2022, Paleontologists described a similar looking animal which was discovered in Cambrian-aged rocks of Utah. The fossil was named &quot;Utaurora comosa,&quot; and was found within the Wheeler Shale. The stem-arthropod was actually first described in 2008, but at the time it was originally considered a specimen of &quot;Anomalocaris.&quot; This discovery could suggest there were other animals that looked like &quot;Opabinia,&quot; and its family may have been more diverse.

==Theoretical significance==

 &quot;Opabinia&quot; made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was &quot;explosive&quot;, and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis &quot;punctuated&quot; by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that &quot;Opabinia&quot;, and other taxa such as &quot;Marrella&quot; and &quot;Yohoia&quot;, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more disparate and &quot;experimental&quot; than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded &quot;Opabinia&quot; as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book &quot;Homage to Opabinia&quot;.

However, other discoveries and analyses soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as &quot;Anomalocaris&quot; from the Burgess Shale and &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, &quot;Aysheaia&quot;, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopodians to include fossil panarthropods that are thought to be close relatives of onychophorans, tardigrades and arthropods but lack jointed limbs. This group was later widely accepted as a paraphyletic grade that led to the origin of extant panarthropod phyla.
While this discussion about specific fossils such as &quot;Opabinia&quot; and &quot;Anomalocaris&quot; was going on in the late 20th century, the concept of stem groups was introduced to cover evolutionary &quot;aunts&quot; and &quot;cousins&quot;. A crown group is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group contains offshoots from members of the lineage earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a &quot;relative&quot; concept, for example tardigrades are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them also as being a stem group relative to the arthropods. Viewing strange-looking organisms like &quot;Opabinia&quot; in this way makes it possible to see that, while the Cambrian explosion was unusual, it can be understood in terms of normal evolutionary processes.

<text>Fusarium ear blight (FEB) (also called Fusarium head blight, FHB, or scab), is a fungal disease of cereals, including wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale. FEB is caused by a range of &quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi, which infects the heads of the crop, reducing grain yield. The disease is often associated with contamination by mycotoxins produced by the fungi already when the crop is growing in the field. The disease can cause severe economic losses as mycotoxin-contaminated grain cannot be sold for food or feed.

==Causal organism==
Fusarium ear blight is caused by several species of &quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi, belonging to the Ascomycota. The most common species causing FEB are:
* &quot;Fusarium avenaceum&quot; (teleomorph: &quot;Gibberella avenacea&quot;)
* &quot;Fusarium culmorum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium graminearum&quot; (teleomorph: &quot;Gibberella zeae&quot;)
* &quot;Fusarium poae&quot;
* &quot;Microdochium nivale&quot; (teleomorph: &quot;Monographella nivalis&quot;, formerly &quot;Fusarium nivale&quot;)
* &quot;Fusarium tricinctum&quot;
&quot;Fusarium graminearum&quot; was considered the most important causal organism. 
&quot;Fusarium&quot; species causing FEB can produce several types of spores. The asexual stage of the fungus produces spores called macroconidia. Some &quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi have a more complex life cycle including a sexual stage, for example &quot;F. graminearum&quot;. In the sexual stage the fungus produces spores called ascospores. The sexual stage form fruiting bodies called perithecia, in which ascospores are formed in a sac known as an ascus (plural asci). Some species, including &quot;F. culmorum,&quot; produce resistant chlamydospores which can survive for a long time in the soil.

== Disease cycle and epidemiology ==
&quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi can overwinter as saprotrophs in the soil or on crop debris that can serve as for the following crop. The fungus can also spread via infected seed. The presence of &quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi on crop debris or seed can cause &quot;Fusarium&quot; seedling blight and foot and root rot. Later, infection of the heads can occur with spores spreading by rain splash from infected crop residues. Another major infection route is airborne inoculum as spores can travel long distances with the wind. The cereal crop is most susceptible at flowering and the probability of infection rises with high moisture and humidity at flowering.

==Symptoms==
In wheat, &quot;Fusarium&quot; infects the head (hence the name &quot;Fusarium head blight&quot;) and causes the kernels to shrivel up and become chalky white. Additionally, the fungus can produce mycotoxins that further reduce the quality of the kernel.

Infected florets (especially the outer glumes) become slightly darkened and oily in appearance. Macroconidia are produced in sporodochia, which gives the spike a bright pink or orange color. Infected kernels may be permeated with mycelia and the surface of the florets totally covered by white, matted mycelia.

== Mycotoxins ==
&quot;Fusarium&quot; species associated with FEB produce a range of mycotoxins—fungal secondary metabolites with toxic effects on animals. One mycotoxin can be produced by several &quot;Fusarium&quot; species, and one species can produce several mycotoxins. Important &quot;Fusarium&quot; mycotoxins include: 
* Deoxynivalenol (DON) produced by &quot;F&quot;. &quot;graminearum&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. &quot;culmorum&quot;
* Zearalenone (ZEN) produced by &quot;F&quot;. &quot;graminearum&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. &quot;culmorum&quot;
* HT-2 and T-2 produced by &quot;F&quot;. &quot;langsethiae&quot;
Fusarium toxins have negative effects on the immune, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems of animals. DON is a protein synthesis inhibitor, also called vomitoxin, due to its negative effects on feed intake in pigs. Pigs are the most sensitive to DON, while ruminant animals such as cattle have higher tolerance.

Many countries monitor &quot;Fusarium&quot; mycotoxins in grain to limit negative health effects. In the U.S. there are advisory levels for DON in human food and livestock feed. The European Union has legislative limits for several &quot;Fusarium&quot; mycotoxins in grain aimed for human consumption repealed by and recommended limits for animal feed.

==Control measures==

=== Resistant cultivars ===
Resistant cultivars could be the most efficient method to control Fusarium ear blight. Resistance breeding involves screening of plant lines subjected to artificial inoculation with &quot;Fusarium&quot;. Plant lines having reduced fungal growth and low levels of seed mycotoxin contamination are selected for additional breeding trials. In parallel, genetic markers associated with resistance are screened for, so called marker-assisted selection. Fusarium ear blight resistance is a complex trait, involving several genes, and is dependent of interaction with the environment.

Fusarium ear blight resistance has been identified in wheat cultivars from Asia. However, the challenge is to combine resistant material with other desirable traits such as high yield and adaptation to different growing areas.

=== Agricultural practices ===
Several agricultural practices affect the risk of FEB. One of the major infection routes are infected crop residues from the previous crop where both the quality and quantity are important. Crop residues from susceptible crops such as cereals increase the risk of FEB in the following crop. Maize has been associated with especially high risk. Reduced soil tillage can also increase the risk of FEB. The amount of crop residues can be reduced by ploughing, where residues are incorporated in the soil where they decompose faster. High nitrogen application has also been associated with increased risk of &quot;Fusarium&quot; infection. Preventive agricultural practices may be less effective if a lot of airborne inoculum is present in the area.

=== Chemical control ===
Fungicides can provide partial control of FEB but the effects may be variable. The type and timing of fungicide application is important as non-optimal applications may even increase &quot;Fusarium&quot; infection.

=== Biological control and integrated management ===
Research has also been put into development on biological control strategies based on bacteria and fungi for example, &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; species&quot;.&quot;

For FEB no control measure is completely effective and integrated management involving several control strategies such as preventive measures, disease monitoring and chemical control is necessary. Disease forecasting models have been developed to assess the risk of FEB depending on weather conditions.

== Economic importance ==
From an economic standpoint, it is one of the major cereal diseases, being responsible for significant grain yield reduction world-wide.

In the U.S. and Canada, Fusarium ear blight emerged in the 1990s as a widespread and powerful threat to cereal production. From 1998 to 2000 the Midwestern United States suffered $2.7 billion in losses following a FEB epidemic. If we include primary and secondary economic losses, FHB cost the entire US$7.67 billion from 1993 to 2001. Since 1990, extensive research has been put into the development of control measures of Fusarium ear blight. An example is the US Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative (USWBSI), a collaborative effort of scientists, growers, food processors and consumer groups aiming to develop effective control measures, including the reduction of mycotoxins.

<text>Fusarium patch is a disease in turf grass settings also called pink snow mold or Microdochium patch. In many cool season grass species in North America, it is caused by the fungus Microdochium nivale . The white-pink mycelium on infected leaf blades is a distinguishing characteristic of the &quot;Microdochium nivale&quot; pathogen. Fusarium patch is considered economically important in the turf grass industry because of its tendency to cause significant injury to golf greens, thereby decreasing putting surface quality. Dissimilar from other snow molds, such as gray snow mold, &quot;Microdochium nivale&quot; does not need snow cover to cause widespread infection.

==Hosts and symptoms==
&quot;M. nivale&quot; can infect all cool-season turf grass species. Annual bluegrass (&quot;Poa annua&quot;), perennial ryegrass (&quot;Lolium perenne&quot;) and creeping bentgrass (&quot;Agrostis stolonifera&quot;) are more susceptible. In the fall, &quot;M.nivale&quot; infection begins as small, orange to red-brown spots, circular and only a few centimeters in diameter. During the winter and into the spring seasons, well-defined, clustered, circular patches 10–20 cm in diameter, of necrotic leaf tissues form on mown turf. &quot;Microdochium nivale&quot; is mostly seen on grasses mown at heights of three inches or greater. On taller grass, patches often lack a circular pattern that is seen in shorter mown grass. Pink snow mold patches usually follow drainage patterns since conidia spores are readily dislodged and transported by rainfall and water flowage. Under prolonged cool and wet conditions, white-pink mycelium can be observed along the circumference of diseased patches.

==Disease cycle==
&quot;M. nivale&quot; begins by oversummering (surviving the summer) in thatch or soil as haploid mycelium or spores. When cool, wet weather arrives in the fall or winter the mycelium grows from thatch or soil and infects leaves. These environmental conditions also favor the development of asexual spores called conidia on conidiophores. These conidia infect leaf sheaths and blades near the soil. Wind and surface water will help aid in the spread of this disease as it will allow for the spores to contact near by healthy plant. The disease becomes very severe if allowed to spread from the leaf blades to the crown of the plant. This usually only happens under extreme circumstances, particularly if snowfall covers unfrozen ground.

==Environment==
&quot;Microdochium nivale&quot; becomes problematic when turf experiences lengthy periods of cool, wet weather typical of fall or spring and into early summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The name is somewhat confusing because the presence of snow is not necessary for this pathogen to develop. The disease can thrive under snow cover, however, if it falls on unfrozen soil with thriving turf. In general this disease tends to develop proficiently when grass is growing at a slower than normal rate. Limiting fall nitrogen applications in an attempt to decrease the growth of grass and promote dormancy can help decrease the incidence of Pink Snow Mold. In regions of high humidity and temperatures ranging between 32 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 to 8 degrees Celsius, pink snow mold will develop rapidly.

==Management==
There are a number of different ways to manage diseases including cultural, chemical, and biological controls. Some of these controls are more effective than others, however, the best approach to a managing any disease, including Microdochium Patch, is an integrated approach called Integrated Pest Management or IPM. IPM uses a combination of chemical, cultural and biological controls to reduce spending on pesticides and to decrease pesticide resistance. The following are some of the most important cultural controls used in managing Microdochium Patch.

===Cultural controls===
Raising the mowing height is an easy way to reduce stress on a turfgrass plant and make the plant less susceptible to attack by disease, but there is a fine line. Turf mowed, less than and above makes the plant more susceptible to disease. Managing the moisture available to the plant is another way to help reduce the incidence of disease. The pathogen that causes Microdochium Patch requires and thrives in moist, cool conditions, therefore making sure that you aren&#x27;t overwatering the turf when conditions are right for infection is very important. Giving the plant only enough water for normal plant function is the best way to ensure disease pressure is reduced as much as possible. Also, starving the turf of moisture can be damaging as this increases susceptibility to infection. Managing the amount of nitrogen available to the plant is another key to decreasing incidence of this disease. Avoiding excess fall nitrogen application will greatly reduce disease pressure of &quot;Microdochium nivale&quot;. On top of that excess nitrogen available to plant produces rapid growth of above ground tissue. This tissue often has thin cell walls and is prone to attack by disease. Managing thatch and soil drainage are two other important ways of controlling this disease as both of these affect the amount of moisture that is available to create a favorable environment to the disease, giving the plant only enough water for normal plant function is the best way to ensure disease pressure is reduced as much as possible. Despite the fact that the above cultural controls cannot completely control Microdochium Patch, when they are all used to reduce disease pressure, they can have a noticeable impact and will help to reduce the amount of chemical control that is required.

===Chemical controls===
Chemical controls (i.e. the use of fungicides) to specifically control turf grass diseases have been around since 1891. Over the years better controls have been developed, all of which tend to be less toxic to animals and the environment when used properly.

There is a wide variety of chemical groups that are labeled for control of Microdochium Patch. They include, but are not limited to the methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) such as thiophanate methyl, the dicarboximides such as iprodione and vinclozolin, the DMIs such as fenarimol and propiconazole, the QoIs such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin, the phenylpyrroles such as fludioxonil, certain aromatic hydrocarbons such as PCNB, and the cholronitriles such as chlorothalonil.

These chemical classes should be rotated so that selection pressure on the disease in limited as to avoid resistant strains of this disease. The applicator should read and follow all label rates and directions. Breaking these directions and misuse of any labeled product is breaking the law. Remember that the label is the law. The best way to control Microdochium Patch especially going into winter is to use a three way spray right before the first snow fall. A combination of a dicarboximides such as iprodione, a chloronitrile such as chlorothalonil, and a DMI such as propiconazole will give sufficient control over the span of an average winter.

==Importance==
Microdochium Patch is a significant problem in the turfgrass management industry. Sports fields, sod farms and home lawns and golf courses can all be damaged by this the disease. The pathogen can be found in the Northern United States and all the way up into Canada, meaning that there is a large area where this pathogen can cause serious disease. The highest incidence of this disease in these areas occurs on golf courses due to the highly managed areas of susceptible turfgrass species such as Creeping Bentgrass (&quot;Agrostis stolonifera&quot;) and Annual Bluegrass (&quot;Poa annua&quot;). It is of particular concern because turf on golf courses is considered a high value crop. Diseases such a Microdochium Patch lower the value of the crop by decreasing its aesthetic value, affecting the playability, and decreasing the overall health of the turf. Because golf course budgets are often quite tight, the reduction of fungicide applications required in a season for snow mold will result in more money elsewhere in the budget. Being that the fungicide budget can be 10% of the maintenance budget, reductions in the use of fungicides can cause a significant increase in the amount of money to do other things. On top of that, reducing fungicide inputs helps keep the environment safe and reduces the chances of fungicide resistance development.

<doc id="146454" wikidata="Q192909" url="?curid=146454" title="Scandal">
<text>A scandal can be broadly defined as the strong social reactions of outrage, anger, or surprise, when accusations or rumours circulate or appear for some reason, regarding a person or persons who are perceived to have transgressed in some way a social norm. These reactions are usually noisy and may be conflicting, and they often have negative effects on the status and credibility of the persons or organizations involved.

Society is scandalized when it becomes aware of breaches of moral norms or legal requirements, often when these have remained undiscovered or been concealed for some time. Such breaches have typically erupted from greed, lust, or the abuse of power. Scandals may be regarded as political, sexual, moral, literary, or artistic, but often spread from one realm into another. The basis of a scandal may be factual or false, or a combination of both. In contemporary times, exposure of a scandalous situation is often made by mass media. 
Contemporary media has the capacity to spread knowledge of a scandal further than in previous centuries and public interest has encouraged many cases of confected scandals relating to well-known people as well as genuine scandals relating to politics and business. Some scandals are revealed by whistleblowers who discover wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s in the United States. Whistleblowers may be protected by laws which are used to obtain information of misdeeds and acts detrimental to their establishments. However, the possibility of scandal has always created a tension between society&#x27;s efforts to reveal wrongdoing and its desire to cover them up, and the act of covering up (or indeed of revealing) a contentious situation may become a scandal.

==Academic and literary==
Academic dishonesty, also referred to as academic misconduct, is any type of cheating that occurs in relation to a formal academic exercise.

Although in the early part of the 19th century held the view that scandal does not mix with literature and science, some opined that a scattering of some amount of scandal in literature could enhance interest of people as scandal suits &quot;the taste of almost every palate.&quot; Scandal, has however, been the subject of many books. Among the most famous of fictional stories about scandal are &quot;School for Scandal&quot; (1777) by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
Literary scandals result from some kind of fraud; either the authors are not who they say they are, or the facts have been misrepresented or they contain some defamation of another person. For example, two books by Holocaust survivors, &quot;Angel at the Fence&quot; by Herman Rosenblat and &quot;&quot; by Misha Defonseca, were found to be based on false information, while a prize won by novelist Helen Darville created a scandal in 1994 around the author&#x27;s fraudulently claimed ancestry.

==Political==
A political scandal occurs when political corruption or other misbehavior is exposed. Politicians or government officials are accused of engaging in illegal, corrupt, or unethical practices. A political scandal can involve the breaking of the nation&#x27;s laws or moral codes and may involve other types of scandal.

==Business==
In 2012, Michael Woodford who successfully steered Olympus, a Japanese company to fame, turned a whistleblower when even as a CEO of the firm, he exposed the financial scandal worth $1.7 billion and fled Japan fearing for his life. Though persecuted his revelations proved to be true resulting in booking the culprits. Portraying a damaging status of corporate Japan, Woodford, in his memoirs has said: &quot;I thought I was going to run a health-care and consumer electronics company, but found I had walked into a John Grisham novel.&quot;

==Media==

Since the development of printing, the media has had greater power to expose scandals and since the advent of mass media, this power has increased. The media also has the capacity to support and/or oppose organizations and destabilize them thereby becoming involved in scandals themselves as well as reporting them.

Following the Watergate scandal in the United States, other English-speaking countries have borrowed the suffix &quot;gate&quot; and added it to scandals of their own.

===Journalism===

Journalistic scandals relate to high-profile incidents or acts, whether done purposefully or by accident. It could be in violation of normally in vogue ethics and standards of journalism. It could also be in violation of the &#x27;ideal&#x27; mission of journalism: to publish &quot;news events and issues accurately and fairly.&quot;

===Television===

The American quiz show of the 1950s generated &quot;hypnotic intensity&quot; among viewers and contestants. The CBS Television show &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; which started on 7 June 1955 and such other shows as &quot;The Big Surprise&quot;, &quot;Dotto,&quot; &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot;, and &quot;Twenty One&quot; became the most publicized quiz shows, but soon generated scandals after a series of revelations that contestants of several popular television quiz shows conspired with the show&#x27;s producers to rig the outcome. The quiz show scandals were driven by a drive for financial gain, a willingness of contestants to &quot;play along&quot; with the assistance, and the lack of regulation prohibiting the rigging of game shows. In October 1958, a New York grand jury was instituted by prosecutor Joseph Stone and the matter was examined with recording of closed-door testimony. Following this, the US Congress ruled rigging a quiz show a federal crime.

==Sex scandals==
A sex scandal is a scandal involving allegations or information about possibly-immoral sexual activities being made public. Sex scandals are often associated with sexual affairs of film stars, politicians, famous athletes and others in the public eye, and become scandals largely because of the prominence of the person involved, perceptions of hypocrisy on their part, or the non-normative or non-consensual nature of their sexual activity. A sex scandal may be based on reality, the product of false allegations, or a mixture of both.

==Sports==

A desire for success and financial gain or the abuse of power in sport have also created many scandals both at an individual and the organisational level. Scandals arising from corruption have an impact of the credibility of sport. The World Anti-Doping Agency, as part of its role to &quot;promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports&quot;, has showed that bribery, doping by athletes and doping sample-tampering, have occurred in collusion with national and international sporting organizations. Some consider that doping is &quot;now endemic&quot; in the world of sport and is becoming extremely pervasive, including more and more sports.

One of the biggest individual scandals flowed from revelations that former American road cycling champion Lance Armstrong had achieved success by consistent, long-term cheating. One of the biggest institutional sporting scandals is the 2015 FIFA corruption case. Doping scandals have plagued the Olympic games as well, such as in the Doping in East Germany scandal and the Asian Games in 1994. Scandals in match games such as Major League baseball and cricket may relate to spot-fixing or gambling.

<doc id="146481" wikidata="Q1637896" url="?curid=146481" title="1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia">
<text>A widespread famine affected Ethiopia from 1983 to 1985. The worst famine to hit the country in a century, it affected 7.75 million people (out of Ethiopia&#x27;s 38–40 million) or 1/5 of the population and left approximately 300,000 to 1.2 million dead. 2.5 million people were internally displaced whereas 400,000 refugees left Ethiopia. Almost 200,000 children were orphaned.

According to Human Rights Watch, more than half its mortality could be attributed to &quot;human rights abuses causing the famine to come earlier, strike harder and extend further than would otherwise have been the case&quot;. According to the United States Agency for International Development, &quot;in the fall of 1984, the hardest hit regions were Tigray, Wollo, and Eritrea – areas with extremely limited road and transportation networks. Moreover, these regions were the scenes of longstanding anti-government rebellions which created precarious security situations.&quot; Other areas of Ethiopia experienced famine for similar reasons, resulting in tens of thousands of additional deaths. The famine as a whole took place a decade into the Ethiopian Civil War.

The famine of 1983–1985 is officially ascribed to drought. In recent years, the favoured explanation for the famine of 1983–1985 is &quot;war and drought&quot;. According to the organizations Human Rights Watch and Oxfam, the famines that struck Ethiopia between 1961 and 1985, and in particular the one of 1983–1985, were in part created by the government&#x27;s military policies, specifically a set of so-called counter-insurgency strategies (against Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front guerrilla-soldiers), and for &quot;social transformation&quot; in non-insurgent areas (against people of Tigray Province, Wollo Province and such).

== Background ==

Throughout the feudal era, famines were common in Ethiopia, especially in the north. Local famines were also frequent but also unrecorded. The most infamous was the &quot;Great Ethiopian Famine&quot; which killed approximately one third of Ethiopia&#x27;s population between 1888 and 1892. In 1958, famine killed 100,000 people. In 1966, famine killed 50,000.

In 1973, drought and feudal extractions caused a famine that killed 40,000 to 200,000 people in Wollo, mostly of the marginalized Afar herders and Oromo tenant farmers, who suffered from the widespread confiscation of land by the wealthy classes and government of Emperor Haile Selassie. Despite attempts to suppress news of this famine, leaked reports contributed to the undermining of the government&#x27;s legitimacy and served as a rallying point for dissidents, who complained that the wealthy classes and the Ethiopian government had ignored both the famine and the people who had died. Then in 1974, a group of military officers known as the Derg overthrew Haile Selassie. The Derg addressed the Wollo famine by creating the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) to examine the causes of the famine and prevent its recurrence, and then abolishing feudal tenure in March 1975. The RRC initially enjoyed more independence from the Derg than any other ministry, largely due to its close ties to foreign donors and the quality of some of its senior staff. As a result, insurgencies began to spread into the country&#x27;s administrative regions.

By late 1976 insurgencies existed in all of the country&#x27;s fourteen administrative regions. The Red Terror (1976–1978) marked the beginning of a steady deterioration in the economic state of the nation, coupled with extractive policies targeting rural areas. The reforms of 1975 were revoked and the Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) was tasked with extracting food from rural peasantry at low rates to placate the urban populations. The very low fixed price of grain served as a disincentive to production, and some peasants had to buy grain on the open market in order to meet their AMC quota. Citizens in Wollo, which continued to be stricken with drought, were required to provide a &quot;famine relief tax&quot; to the AMC until 1984. The Derg also imposed a system of travel permits to restrict peasants from engaging in non-agricultural activities, such as petty trading and migrant labor, a major form of income supplementation. However, the collapse of the system of State Farms, a large employer of seasonal laborers, resulted in an estimated 500,000 farmers in northern Ethiopia losing a component of their income. Grain wholesaling was declared illegal in much of the country, resulting in the number of grain dealers falling from between 20,000 and 30,000 to 4,942 in the decade after the revolution.

The nature of the RRC changed as the government became increasingly authoritarian. Immediately after its creation, its experienced core of technocrats produced highly regarded analyses of Ethiopian famine and ably carried out famine relief efforts. However, by the 1980s, the Derg had compromised its mission. The RRC began with the innocuous scheme of creating village workforces from the unemployed in state farms, and government agricultural schemes but, as the counter-insurgency intensified, the RRC was given responsibility for a program of forced resettlement and villagization. As the go-between for international aid organizations and foreign donor governments, the RRC redirected food to government militias, in particular in Eritrea and Tigray. It also encouraged international agencies to set up relief programs in regions with surplus grain production, which allowed the AMC to collect the excess food. Finally, the RRC carried out a disinformation campaign during the 1980s famine, in which it portrayed the famine as being solely the result of drought and overpopulation and tried to deny the existence of the armed conflict that was occurring precisely in the famine-affected regions. The RRC also claimed that the aid being given by it and its international agency partners were reaching all of the famine victims.

The Mengistu Haile Mariam-led military dictatorship (Derg) used this 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia as government military policy by restricting food supplies for strategy against the counter-insurgency of the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front&#x27;s guerrilla-soldiers, and for &quot;social transformation&quot; in non-insurgent areas (against people of Tigray province, Welo province and such). Due to organized government policies that deliberately multiplied the effects of the famine, around 1.2 million people died in Ethiopia from the famine where the majority of the death tolls were from the present day Tigray Region and Amhara Region and other parts of northern Ethiopia.

Before the 1983–1985 famine, two decades of wars of national liberation and other anti-government conflict had raged throughout northern Ethiopia and present-day Eritrea. The most prominent feature of the fighting was the use of indiscriminate violence against civilians by the Ethiopian Army and Air Force. Excluding those killed by famine and resettlement, more than 150,000 people were killed.

The economy of Ethiopia is based on agriculture: almost half of GDP, 60% of exports, and 80% of total employment come from agriculture.

== Famine ==

Four Ethiopian provinces — Gojjam, Hararghe, Tigray and Wollo — all received record low rainfalls in the mid-1980s. In the south, a separate and simultaneous cause was the government&#x27;s response to Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) insurgency. In 1984, Mengistu Haile Mariam announced that 46% of the Ethiopian Gross National Product would be allocated to military spending, creating the largest standing army in sub-Saharan Africa; the allocation for health in the government budget fell from 6% in 1973–1974 to 3% by 1990–1991.

Although a UN estimate of one million deaths is often quoted for the 1983–1985 famine, this figure has been challenged by famine scholar Alex de Waal. In a major study, de Waal criticized the United Nations for being &quot;remarkably cavalier&quot; about the numbers of people who died, with the UN&#x27;s one-million figure having &quot;absolutely no scientific basis whatsoever,&quot; a fact which represents &quot;a trivialization and dehumanization of human misery&quot;. De Waal estimates that 400,000 to 500,000 died in the famine.

Nevertheless, the magnitude of the disaster has been well documented: in addition to hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions were made destitute. Media activity in the West, along with the size of the crisis, led to the &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; charity single and the July 1985 concert Live Aid, which elevated the international profile of the famine and helped secure international aid. In the early to mid-1980s there were famines in two distinct regions of the country, resulting in several studies of one famine that try to extrapolate to the other or less cautious writers referring to a single widespread famine. The famine in the southeast of the country was brought about by the Derg&#x27;s counterinsurgency efforts against the OLF. However, most media referring to &quot;the Ethiopian famine&quot; of the 1980s refers to the severe famine in 1983–85 centered on Tigray and northern Wollo, which further affected Eritrea, Begemder and northern Shewa. Living standards had been declining in these government-held regions since 1977, a &quot;direct consequence&quot; of the Derg&#x27;s agricultural policies. A further major contributing factor to the famine were the Ethiopian government&#x27;s enforced resettlement programs, utilized as part of its counter-insurgency campaign.

Despite RRC claims to have predicted the famine, there was little data as late as early 1984 indicating an unusually severe food shortage. Following two major droughts in the late 1970s, 1980 and 1981 were rated by the RRC as &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;above normal&quot;. The 1982 harvest was the largest ever, with the exception of central and eastern Tigray. RRC estimates for people &quot;at-risk&quot; of famine rose to 3.9 million in 1983 from 2.8 million in 1982, which was less than the 1981 estimate of 4.5 million. In February and March 1983, the first signs of famine were recognized as poverty-stricken farmers began to appear at feeding centers, prompting international aid agencies to appeal for aid and the RRC to revise its famine assessment. The harvest after the main (&quot;meher&quot;) harvest in 1983 was the third largest on record, with the only serious shortfall again being recorded in Tigray. In response, grain prices in the two northern regions of Begemder and Gojjam fell. However, famine recurred in Tigray. The RRC claimed in May 1984 that the failure of the short rains (&quot;belg&quot;) constituted a catastrophic drought while neglecting to state that the &quot;belg&quot; crops form a fourth of crop yields where the &quot;belg&quot; falls, but none at all in the majority of Tigray. A quantitative measure of the famine are grain prices, which show high prices in eastern and central Tigray, spreading outward after the 1984 crop failure.

A major drain on Ethiopia&#x27;s economy was the ongoing civil war, which pitched rebel movements against the Soviet and Cuban-backed Derg government. This crippled the country&#x27;s economy further and contributed to the government&#x27;s lack of ability to handle the crisis to come.

By mid-1984, it was evident that another drought and resulting famine of major proportions had begun to affect large parts of northern Ethiopia. Just as evident was the government&#x27;s inability to provide relief. The almost total failure of crops in the north was compounded by fighting in and around Eritrea, which hindered the passage of relief supplies. Although international relief organizations made a major effort to provide food to the affected areas, the persistence of drought and poor security conditions in the north resulted in continuing need as well as hazards for famine relief workers. In late 1985, another year of drought was forecast, and by early 1986 the famine had spread to parts of the southern highlands, with an estimated 5.8 million people dependent on relief food. In 1986, locust plagues exacerbated the problem.

==Response to the famine==
Despite the fact that the government had access to only a minority of the famine-stricken population in the north, the great majority of the relief was channeled through the government side, prolonging the war.

The Ethiopian government&#x27;s unwillingness to deal with the famine provoked universal condemnation by the international community. Even many supporters of the Ethiopian regime opposed its policy of withholding food shipments to rebel areas. The combined effects of famine and internal war had by then put the nation&#x27;s economy into a state of decline.

The primary government response to the drought and famine was the decision to uproot large numbers of peasants who lived in the affected areas in the north and to resettle them in the west and southern part of the country. In 1985 and 1986, about 600,000 people were moved, many forcibly, from their home villages and farms by the military and transported to various regions in the south. Many peasants fled rather than allow themselves to be resettled; many of those who were resettled sought later to return to their native regions. Several human rights organizations claimed that tens of thousands of peasants died as a result of forced resettlement. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 50,000 people died.

Another government plan involved villagization, which was a response not only to the famine but also to the poor security situation. Beginning in 1985, peasants were forced to move their homesteads into planned villages, which were clustered around water, schools, medical services, and utility supply points to facilitate the distribution of those services. Many peasants fled rather than acquiesce in relocation, which in general proved highly unpopular. Additionally, the government in most cases failed to provide the promised services. Far from benefiting agricultural productivity, the program caused a decline in food production. Although temporarily suspended in 1986, villagization was subsequently resumed.

===International view===
Close to 8 million people became famine victims during the drought of 1984, and over 1 million died. In the same year (23 October), a BBC news crew was the first to document the famine, with Michael Buerk describing &quot;a biblical famine in the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the closest thing to hell on Earth&quot;. The report shocked Britain, motivating its citizens to inundate relief agencies, such as Save the Children, with donations, and also to bring the world&#x27;s attention to the crisis in Ethiopia.

In November 1984, the British Royal Air Force carried out the first airdrops from Hercules C-130s delivering food to the starving people. Other countries including Sweden, East and West Germany, Poland, Canada, United States, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were also involved in the international response.

===Charity===
Buerk&#x27;s news piece on the BBC was seen by Irish singer Bob Geldof, who quickly organised the charity supergroup Band Aid, primarily made up of the biggest British and Irish artists of the era. Their single, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, was released on 3 December 1984 and became Britain&#x27;s best-selling single within a few weeks, eventually selling 3.69 million copies domestically. It raised £8 million for famine relief within twelve months of its release. Other charity singles soon followed; released in March 1985, &quot;We Are the World&quot; by USA for Africa was the most successful of these, selling 20 million copies worldwide.

Live Aid, a 1985 fund-raising effort headed by Geldof, induced millions of people in the West to donate money and to urge their governments to participate in the relief effort in Ethiopia. Some of the proceeds also went to the famine hit areas of Eritrea. The event raised £145 million.

In France, supergroup Chanteurs sans frontières released &quot;SOS Éthiopie&quot;, which sold 1 million copies and raised 10 million francs (about 1.2 million dollars).

In Canada, supergroup Northern Lights, consisting of Bryan Adams, The Guess Who, Rush, Anne Murray, John Candy, Neil Young, and among others sang &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, which was produced by David Foster.

In Yugoslavia, supergroup YU Rock Misija recorded the charity single &quot;Za milion godina&quot; and organized a corresponding charity concert, raising a total of US$426,000.

Other charity initiatives raised money for Ethiopia. On 27 January 1985, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints participated in a special fast, where members went without food for two meals and donated the money they would have used to buy food. The fast raised $6 million for the famine victims in Ethiopia.

==Effect on aid policy==
The manner in which international aid was routed through the RRC gave rise to criticism that forever changed the way in which governments and NGOs respond to international emergencies taking place within conflict situations. International aid supplied to the government and to relief agencies working alongside the government became part of the counter-insurgency strategy of the government. It, therefore, met a real and immediate need but also prolonged the life of Mengistu&#x27;s government. The response to the emergency raised disturbing questions about the relationship between humanitarian agencies and host governments.

However, according to Peter Gill, in his 2010 book &quot;Foreigners and Famine: Ethiopia Since Live Aid&quot;, 7.9 million people faced starvation in 1984, resulting in over 600,000 deaths; while in 2003 13.2 million &quot;faced the prospect of a famine and only 300 died&quot;.

===Aid money and rebel groups===
On 3 March 2010, Martin Plaut of the BBC published evidence that millions of dollars worth of aid to the Ethiopian famine were spent in buying weapons by the Tigrayan People&#x27;s Liberation Front, a communist group trying to overthrow the Ethiopian communist government at the time. Rebel soldiers said they posed as merchants as &quot;a trick for the NGOs&quot;. The report also cited a CIA document saying aid was &quot;almost certainly being diverted for military purposes&quot;. One rebel leader estimated $95 million (£63 million). Plaut also said that other NGOs were under the influence or control of the Derg military junta. Some journalists suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and Oxfam money to fund its enforced resettlement and &quot;villagization&quot; programs, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed. These reports were later refuted by the Band Aid Trust and after a seven-month investigation, the BBC found its reporting had been misleading regarding Band Aid&#x27;s money and had also contained numerous errors of fact and misstatements of evidence:

Following a complaint from the Band Aid Trust the BBC&#x27;s Editorial Complaints Unit found in its ruling that there was no evidence to support such statements and that &quot;they should not have been broadcast&quot;. It also added that &quot;The BBC wishes to apologise unreservedly to the Band Aid Trust for the misleading and unfair impression which was created&quot;.

==Death toll==
Outsider estimates like Alex de Waal&#x27;s, believe the famine of 1983–1985 killed a minimum of 400,000 people (not counting those killed by resettlement), just in northern Ethiopia (Tigray Province); &quot;Something over half of this mortality can be attributed to human rights abuses causing the famine to come earlier, strike harder, and extend further than would otherwise have been the case.&quot;

The United States Agency for International Development which provided foreign assistance during the famine, estimated that &quot;more than 300,000&quot; died.

Other insider estimates put the total death toll in Ethiopia at &quot;1.2 million dead, 400,000 refugees outside the country, 2.5 million people internally displaced, and almost 200,000 orphans&quot;.

<text>Billund Municipality () is a &quot;kommune&quot; in the centre of the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark. Formerly the municipality belonged to Ribe County. The new, merged municipality covers an area of 540.18 km², and has a total population of 27,119 (2024). Its mayor is Stephanie Storbank, a member of Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The site of its municipal council is the town of Grindsted, which is the largest town in the municipality followed by the city of Billund.

On 1 January 2007, as a result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007), approved by the lawmakers in Folketinget 16 June 2005, and, after the signature by the head of state, published in Lovtidende, and being in effect from 26 June 2005, the new municipality was formed. The old Billund municipality was combined with the former Grindsted Municipality and the part of Billund Airport that was located in Give Municipality. The first election to the municipal council in the new municipality (and the regional council in the new region) was held 15 November 2005, which was the regular date of elections once every four years.

<doc id="146487" wikidata="Q44391" url="?curid=146487" title="Blåvandshuk">
<text>Blåvandshuk is a headland on the North Sea coast of Jutland northwest of Esbjerg, and is the westernmost point of metropolitan Denmark. The Blåvand Lighthouse is the westernmost located building in Denmark.

==Natural Environment==
A significant portion of Blåvandshuk is marsh land, moor, dunes, and beaches.

Because Blåvandshuk is on the coast and has a peninsula (&quot;Skallingen&quot;) which stretches to the southeast, it is surrounded by much water. To the northwest is the North Sea. To the southeast of &quot;Skallingen&quot; is Fanø Bay (&quot;Fanø Bugt&quot;) and the island Fanø. Beyond Fanø Bay is the Wadden Sea. To the northeast of &quot;Skallingen&quot; lies Ho Bay (&quot;Ho Bugt&quot;) and the small island of Langli.

&quot;Skallingen&quot; and the waters off its coast are protected, a part of the Wadden Sea wildlife reserve and protection area being discussed as a potential national park.

==Administrative status==
Prior to January 1, 2007, Blåvandshuk was also the name of a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) that contained the headland. The municipality covered an area of 223 km2, and had a total population of 4,378 (2005). Its last mayor was Hans Chr. Thoning, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The main town and site of its municipal council was the town of Oksbøl. Blåvandshuk municipality ceased to exist due to &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with former Blaabjerg, Helle, Varde, and Ølgod municipalities to form the new Varde municipality.

Owing to its westerly position &quot;Blåvand&quot; for many years was home to an important coast radio station (from 1914) and later satellite radio hubs, including the Inmarsat station &quot;Blaavand-Atlantic-East&quot;. In 1996 the radio station became remotely controlled from Lyngby Radio and finally closed down entirely in 2019. The radio station was of great importance to those employed in North Sea fishery, and the message &quot;Blåvand melder storm&quot; (en: &quot;Blaavand storm warning&quot;) was a particularly dreaded message, so much that a film was made with this title (Blaavand melder storm) in 1938.

==Mines==
Located on &quot;Skallingen&quot;&#x27;s southwestern coast was Denmark&#x27;s last minefield, left over from Second World War, when 1,389,289 landmines were placed in Denmark by the German occupation forces as part of their defence line. A 1.86 km2 closed-off area on the peninsula still contained mines sixty years after the war. Demining efforts were hampered by the shifting sands that can bury mines several meters underground, and the drift of the sea which has moved the beach some 200 meters to the east since the end of the war. In accordance with the Ottawa Convention and Article 5 of the Mine Ban Treaty most of the minefield was cleared in 2006–2008 by the Ministry of Transport and the Danish Coastal Authority, and the last, most difficult section in 2012. Some 3,098 antipersonnel mines, 259 antivehicle mines, and 554 unexploded ordnance were collected and destroyed.

<doc id="146489" wikidata="Q20837" url="?curid=146489" title="Fanø">
<text>Fanø () is a Danish island in the North Sea off the coast of southwestern Denmark, and is the very northernmost of the Danish Wadden Sea Islands. Fanø Municipality () is the &quot;kommune&quot; that covers the island and its seat is the town of Nordby.

== Island ==
Fanø is separated from the mainland by the Wadden Sea over a span of approximately ., in the north at the closest point to the mainland 1.24 km. The island is long and wide, and it is located off the coast from the city of Esbjerg to which it is connected by ferry. The ferry ride takes 12 minutes.

A variety of environments are to be found on Fanø. Not surprisingly, a very common one is sand. The island&#x27;s whole western shore is one long beach. The island&#x27;s northwestern corner is a vast sandbank called &quot;Søren Jessens Sand&quot;. Søren Jessen was an entrepreneur and captain from Hjerting, today the westernmost suburb of Esbjerg and the bank is named after him because his ship, the &quot;Anne Catriane&quot;, stranded here in 1712.

The vegetation on Fanø is mainly heath and small pine trees, never growing tall because of the predominant strong westerly winds from the North Sea.

Fanø relies heavily on tourism and is visited by some 30,000 people each summer. The main attraction is the fine white sand beach, which is also a popular playground for all kinds of wind and water sports, such as kite flying, surfing and buggies.

Long before paved roads, the beach - being long, straight and quite firm - hosted a yearly motorcycle and car racing event from 1919 and until 1923, where a tragic accident killed a local boy and put a stop to further events. Today is possible to drive your own car on the beach all the way from Sønderho to Fanø Vesterhavsbad. A public bus service is also operated on the beach. 1 January 2018 the municipality took over the responsibilities of public mass transit on the island from the Region of Southern Denmark.

Also unique is the Wadden Sea with seals and migrating birds, as well as the two sailor towns Nordby and Sønderho with their maritime history, once among the most wealthy and influential in Denmark, and their vernacular architecture consisting of thatched-roof houses all oriented west–east, again because of the westerly winds.

During World War II, Fanø was part of the Atlantic Wall and the remains of the 300 bunkers built by the Nazis can still be spotted along the coast line.

A number of animals that are otherwise common in Denmark, such as vipers, squirrels, moles and badgers, are nonexistent on the island, whereas foxes, hedgehogs, roebucks, hares and especially rabbits exist in abundance.

Fanø is known as a place of summer vacation homes for the well-to-do, and has maintained its population number in contrast to other small islands in Denmark.

==Politics==
Fanø&#x27;s municipal council consists of 11 members, elected every four years.

===Municipal council===
Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

* Thomas Sneum (1917–2007), Naval pilot who helped deliver vital photographs of a Nazi radar installation on Fanø to British authorities by using a fragile and risky biplane. Born in Sønderho. 
* Tove Birkelund (1928–1986), historical geologist
* Eva Louise Buus (born 1979), Danish artist. In 2015, she exhibited works in Fanø Museum.

<doc id="146492" wikidata="Q322361" url="?curid=146492" title="Ribe">
<text>Ribe () is a town in south-west Jutland, Denmark, with a population of 8,295 (2024). It is the seat of the Diocese of Ribe. Until 1 January 2007, Ribe was the seat of both a surrounding municipality and county. It is now part of the enlarged Esbjerg Municipality in the Region of Southern Denmark. It is the oldest town in Denmark.

==History==

The town was a center of commercial activity in the early 8th century, and this may have originated with royal influence. Coins may have been struck there in 720. Whichever king was involved in the digging of the Kanhave Canal may have been involved in the establishment of Ribe also. Trade contacts were mostly with Frisia and England. Of the over 300 sceatas found in Denmark, 216 come from in or around Ribe, most of them were of the Frisian Wodan type, and these were likely minted in Ribe in the early eighth century. The Ancient Diocese of Ribe was established in 948 with the consecration of Leofdag of Ribe as its first bishop.

Early in the ninth century a 2-meter wide ditch (a demarcation rather than a fortification) was dug around the town, enclosing a 12-hectare area. Later that century the ditch was replaced by a moat, 6 to 7 meters wide. Archeological evidence shows Ribe was &quot;an active and impressive market place&quot; in the eighth and ninth centuries, and again at the end of the eleventh century, but there is little evidence from the period in between; the town may have dwindled or even disappeared.

When archbishop Ansgar set out to christianize Scandinavia, he requested (in about 860) of King Horik II of Denmark that the first Scandinavian church be built in Ribe, which at the time was one of the most important trade cities in Scandinavia. However, the presence in Ribe of a bishop, and thus a cathedral, can only be confirmed from the year 948. Recent archaeological excavations in Ribe, however, have led to the discovery of between 2,000 and 3,000 Christian graves. They have been dated to the ninth century, indicating that a large Christian community was already living peacefully together with the Vikings at the time. Excavations conducted between 2008 and 2012 have also revealed more details of the original church built by Ansgar.

Construction on the Ribe Cathedral started in 1150, on top of an earlier church, most probably Ansgar&#x27;s church, built in 860. The Treaty of Ribe was proclaimed in 1460. Being located in a large region of low-lying marshland, Ribe has repeatedly been hit by storm floods, the most devastating being the Burchardi flood of 1634. The marks after this flood can still be seen on the cathedral&#x27;s walls and is also marked as the top point on a flood pillar in the town. Today Ribe, along with much of the Wadden Sea coastline, is protected by dykes.

The Catholic diocese was dissolved in 1536 during the Reformation; it was succeeded by the Diocese of Ribe, governed by the newly established protestant Church of Denmark.

On 1 January 2007, the Municipality of Ribe ceased to exist as it merged with the municipalities of Esbjerg and Bramming, now forming the new municipality of Esbjerg.

==Demographics==
The following table shows the population of Ribe. Data from before the 18th century are estimates, the rest are taken from the official census.

==Notable sites==
*Ribe Cathedral
*Ribe Kunstmuseum - an art museum
*Riberhus - a castle (only some ruins remain, along with the water moat) likely built by Eric V of Denmark in the 1200s
*Wadden Sea Centre - a museum and visitors center for the Wadden Sea National Park, located a few km outside Ribe

==Education==

The town of Ribe has a long history as a center of learning. The cathedral school (Ribe Katedralskole) has its roots in the Latin School of Ribe, dating back to at least 1145, when the bishop officially handed over the chapter&#x27;s school. The school provided religious education of priests and clergymen up until 1805 and is nowadays a gymnasium (Danish high school). Ribe Katedralskole celebrated its 850th anniversary in 1995, and is the oldest continuously existing school in Scandinavia.

<doc id="146495" wikidata="Q308106" url="?curid=146495" title="Ølgod">
<text>Ølgod is a railway town on the Jutland peninsula in southwest Denmark. As of 1 January 2024, it had a population of 3,763.

Ølgod is served by Ølgod railway station, located on the Esbjerg-Struer railway line.

Despite the town&#x27;s relatively small size, Ølgod calls itself &quot;Denmark&#x27;s smallest city&quot; due to its relatively large amount of shops, restaurants, associations, healthcare opportunities etc.

== Ølgod Church ==
Ølgod Church is built in the Romanesque style, presumably as a manor church, around 1200. The church tower was built around 1500, while the altarpiece is from 1596.

==Museums==

Ølgod Museum, located in the Culture House, tells the story of Danish agriculture, from poor heath farmers to democratic modern farmers.

Hjedding Andelsmejeri, situated about south of Ølgod, was the first cooperative dairy in Denmark, founded in 1882. Now it is a museum where the machines that helped to revolutionise the Danish dairy operation are on display.

==Ølgod Municipality==

The former Ølgod Municipality covered an area of and had a total population of 11,351 as of 2005. Ølgod Municipality&#x27;s last mayor was Erik Buhl Nielsen.

On 1 January 2007, the municipality ceased to exist as a result of the &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot;. It was merged with Blaabjerg, Blåvandshuk, Helle and Varde municipalities to form a new Varde Municipality.

== References in popular culture ==
Ølgod native Maren Madsen Christensen wrote a memoir titled &quot;Fra Jyllands Brune Heder til Landet Over Havet&quot; (Eng: &quot;From Jutland&#x27;s Brown Heather to the Land Across the Sea&quot;) about her time growing up in Denmark and her later life in Yarmouth, Maine. Christensen died in 1965, aged 93.

<text>Helle (; ), or Ellie, sometimes also called  (, &quot;daughter of Athamas&quot;), was a character in Greek mythology who figured prominently in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Helle is known for giving her name to the strait of Hellespont (&quot;sea of Helle&quot;), in which she fell while crossing it along with her brother Phrixus.

==Mythology==
Phrixus, son of King Athamas of Boeotia and the half-nymph Nephele, along with his younger sister, Helle, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the children, roasting all the town&#x27;s crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus.

Yet before he was killed, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. For reasons unknown, Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was subsequently named after her) and either drowned or was rescued by Poseidon and turned into a sea-goddess, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeetes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeetes placed in a consecrated grove, under the care of a sleepless dragon.

With the Greek god Poseidon, Helle was the mother of the giant Almops and Paeon (called Edonus in some accounts).

<text>Until 1 January 2007 Holmsland was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Ringkjøbing County on the west coast of the Jutland peninsula in west Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 95 km2 on a narrow strip of land, Holmsland Dunes (&quot;Holmsland Klit&quot;), which is connected to the mainland on the north and south, and bounded on the east by Ringkøbing Fjord and on the west by the North Sea. It had a total population of 5,285 (2005). Its last mayor was Ivar Enevoldsen. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Hvide Sande (&quot;White Sands&quot;).

The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that combined a number of existing parishes:
* Gammelsogn Parish
* Holmsland Klit Parish
* Nysogn Parish

Holmsland municipality ceased to exist due to &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with existing Egvad, Ringkøbing, Skjern, and Videbæk municipalities to form the new Ringkøbing-Skjern municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 1,485 km2 and a total population of 57,818 (2005). The new municipality belong to Region Midtjylland (&quot;Mid-Jutland Region&quot;). The merger was a hot issue in Holmsland municipality, since Holmslund distinguished itself by having Denmark&#x27;s lowest tax rate, and residents expected that this rate would increase on account of the merger. According to &quot;Dagbladet Børsen&quot;, Denmark&#x27;s leading business paper, residents risked a loss on their properties of more than 250,000 DKr, and a yearly tax increase of 15,000 DKr on account of the merger .

==The town of Hvide Sande ==

The town of Hvide Sande lies in the middle of the former municipality and is Denmark&#x27;s 5th largest fishing harbour. It was established on either side of the canal that runs from the North Sea into Ringkøbing Fjord. The canal was dedicated in 1931.

Archeological finds suggest that the town was founded in the 13th century. At that time it was the only real harbour town along the Danish west coast, being sheltered from the North Sea by the wall of Holmsland Dunes (&quot;Holmsland Klit&quot;).

In the 17th century, the strait connecting Ringkøbing Fjord to the North Sea began to move south under the influence of wind and tide; soon it was no longer navigable. Ringkøbing was cut off from the sea until the beginning of the 20th century, when a new channel was built at the town of Hvide Sande, in nearby Holmsland municipality.

The name Ringkøbing means &quot;The market town near Rindum&quot;. By the 11th century, a church had been built in the small village of Rindum. The village is probably even older. Evidence of settlements dating back as far as the 6th century has been found.

On the 27th of January in 1443, the towns&#x27; privilege of &quot;købstad&quot; (Danish for market town) was cemented by the Danish king Christopher of Bavaria by royal charter. The royal privilege is most likely older, dating back to king Valdemar IV Atterdag, as the document cementing the royal privilege of the town mentions the original privilege originating from the reign of &quot;King Valdemar&quot;.

At the end of World War II, Ringkøbing was involved in the British testing of captured German V-weapons. British soldiers, including radar experts from the British Artillery Regiment, were stationed there in October 1945 to monitor the accuracy of weapons fired from a base in Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony, Germany. The tests were part of the post-WWII justice process, to establish whether the use of V-weapons constituted indiscriminate killing of civilians. In fact, they proved to be very accurate, and the Nazis escaped this charge.

==Main sights==
Today the centre of Ringkøbing has some quaint old streets, most of which lead towards the water of the fjord.

Ringkøbing Church was built in the early 15th century, and its tower, which is wider on top than on the bottom, was erected ca. 1550. The church houses two organs: the oldest in the west pulpit was built by Demant &amp; Son in 1861 with a baroque facade from 1633; the other from 1974 is by Frobenius &amp; Sons. As the result of a restoration in 1995–1996, the church has a number of modern features, including an altarpiece by Arne Haugen Sørensen and a glass baptismal font.

<text>Until January 1, 2007, Thyholm was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Ringkjøbing County on the island of Vendsyssel-Thy, a part of the Jutland peninsula in northwest Denmark. The municipality included the island of Jegindø, and it covered an area of 76 km2. It had a total population of 3,577 (2005). Its last mayor was Peter Gade, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Det Konservative Folkeparti&quot;) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Hvidbjerg.
The municipality was located on Thyholm, a peninsula connected to Sydthy by a very narrow stretch of land and road, ca. 1.5 km long and .5 km wide. Except for this narrow land connection Thyholm was surrounded by the waters of the Limfjord, which separates the island of Vendsyssel-Thy on which Thyholm is located from the Jutland peninsula to the south. These waters defined most of the municipality&#x27;s borders:

The 472 meter long Oddesund Bridge () connects the former municipality at the town of Oddesund Nord to the town of Oddesund Syd.

The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that combined a number of existing parishes:
* Hvidbjerg Parish
* Jegindø Parish
* Lyngs Parish
* Odby Parish
* Søndbjerg Parish

Thyholm municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged into Struer Municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 248 km2 and a total population of 22,752 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Midtjylland (&quot;Mid-Jutland Region&quot;).

<doc id="146526" wikidata="Q2689028" url="?curid=146526" title="Lejre">
<text>Lejre is a railway town in the northwestern part of the island of Zealand in eastern Denmark. It has a population of 3,165 (1 January 2024) inhabitants.

The town is located in Lejre Municipality (Danish: &quot;Lejre Kommune&quot;) in Region Zealand. The town&#x27;s Old Norse name was &quot;Hleiðr&quot; or &quot;Hleiðargarðr.&quot;

==Lejre Municipality==
Lejre municipality has an area of 240 km2 and a total population of ca. 26,989 (2014),and the municipal seat is Kirke Hvalsø.

==History==
Lejre&#x27;s role in Danish history can be compared to that of Gamla Uppsala in Sweden. Moreover, it has long been thought to have been the real-world counterpart to Heorot, the hall of King Hrothgar at the centre of the action in the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

Lejre is sometimes assumed to have been the capital of a putative Iron Age kingdom sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lejre Kingdom.&quot; According to early legends, it was ruled by kings of the Skjöldung dynasty, predecessors of the kings of medieval Denmark. Legends of the kings of Lejre are known from a number of medieval sources, including the twelfth-century written by Saxo Grammaticus and the anonymous twelfth-century , or &quot;Chronicle of Lejre&quot;. As the home of the Skjölding () dynasty mentioned in &quot;Beowulf,&quot; Lejre has long been thought to have been the real-world counterpart to Heorot, the fabulous royal hall where the first part of the action of that Anglo-Saxon poem takes place. Among other works of the medieval imagination that tell of adventures at Lejre, the best known is the fourteenth-century Icelandic &quot;Saga of King Hrolf Kraki&quot;.

Archeological excavations undertaken since the 1980s have produced dramatic confirmation that medieval legends of Lejre, though largely fabulous, have a basis in history. Research teams led by archaeologist Tom Christensen of Roskilde Museum have uncovered the remains of an extensive Iron Age and Viking Age settlement complex just outside the hamlet of Gammel Lejre (&quot;Old Lejre&quot;). Discovered here were the post-holes for a series of large rectangular buildings measuring fifty to sixty meters in length or more. These must have been the halls of powerful magnates or kings. Outbuildings and other structures whose remains were unearthed in this same area indicate that Lejre was also a center for crafts, commerce, and religious observances. The relative absence of weapon finds suggests that the site was more important as a social and economic center than as a military base. A noteworthy loose find that has recently turned up, thanks to metal detector work, is a tiny silver Viking Age figurine known as Odin from Lejre. This is thought to depict the god Odin enthroned in majesty between ravens.

Other sites of archaeological interest in the vicinity, long admired by visitors even when their nature was not well understood, are a Viking-Age cemetery that includes several ship settings, a great Iron Age cremation mound (&quot;Grydehøj&quot;), a number of tumuli that are mostly of Bronze Age date, and several Neolithic chamber graves, including one that in modern times has been known as &quot;Harald Hildetandshøy&quot;. As for the Iron Age archaeological settlement complex unearthed since the 1980s, its two related parts span the period from about 550 to about 1000 AD, thus confirming the significance of this &quot;land of legends&quot; over a period of almost half a millennium, up to the time when Denmark was converted to Christianity and a new royal capital was established at what is now the cathedral city of Roskilde.

On account of its imposing monuments as well as its unusual surrounding terrain, Gammel Lejre has long been a focal point for antiquarian scholarship, a source of Danish national pride, and a source of fascination regarding Scandinavian prehistory. Speculations about the prehistory of the area have been fueled by Thietmar of Merseburg&#x27;s account in his twelfth-century &quot;Chronicon&quot; (ch. 17) that pagan sacrifices were formerly held every ninth year at Lejre. A wooded path and lake a short distance west of Lejre, as well, was identified by some antiquarian scholars as &quot;Herthadal,&quot; the sacred sacrificial precinct of the goddess Nerthus (also called Hertha), whose rites were described by the Roman historian Tacitus in chapter 40 of his Germania. While such speculations can be dismissed as contributing to a &quot;myth of Lejre&quot; that has little to do with the actual Iron Age settlement-complex that has now been excavated, it could be argued that reality and fantasy have always been intertwined in stories pertaining to this region.

==Attractions==
Lejre Municipality is home to the Land of legends (Sagnlandet Lejre), a center for experimental archaeology and education, which includes reconstructions and recreations from different periods of Denmark&#x27;s history— from pre-history to the Viking Age. The centerpiece of the facility is an Iron Age village reconstruction, complete with sacrificial bog. The center is open to the public.

Ledreborg, a palatial Baroque mansion, also lies in the vicinity.
Lejre Stadion, an association football stadium built in 1989.

==Transport==

Lejre is served by Lejre railway station located on the railway line between Roskilde and Holbæk.

<text>Ramsø was a municipality (Danish &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Roskilde County on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in east Denmark until 1 January 2007. The municipality covered an area of and had a total population in 2005 of 9,320. Its last mayor was Poul Lindor Nielsen, a member of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot;) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was Viby. Other towns and villages in the municipality were Gadstrup, Skalstrup, Snoldelev and Ørsted.

The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (&quot;municipality reform&quot;) that combined existing parishes:
* Dåstrup Parish
* Gadstrup Parish
* Snoldelev Parish
* Syv Parish
* Ørsted Parish

Ramsø municipality ceased to exist as the result of the &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) of 2007. It was merged with the existing Gundsø and Roskilde municipalities to form the new Roskilde Municipality, with an area of and a total population in 2015 of 79,441. The new municipality belongs to Region Sjælland (&quot;Zealand Region&quot;).

<doc id="146531" wikidata="Q5132441" url="?curid=146531" title="Click track">
<text>A click track is a series of audio cues used to synchronize sound recordings, sometimes for synchronization to a moving image. The click track originated in early sound movies, where optical marks were made on the film to indicate precise timings for musical accompaniment. It can also serve a purpose similar to a metronome, as in the music industry, where it is often used during recording sessions and live performances.

==History==

The earliest known usage of &quot;precise timing-aid&quot; in movies may have been by Walt Disney’s team when recording music and sound effects for their early cartoons. Since cartoons at that time did not include dialogue, the jokes onscreen relied heavily on how precisely they were synchronized with the sound effects (e.g., one character hitting another with a frying pan is funniest when it occurs simultaneously with the &quot;boing&quot; sound effect). When the timing is bad, the joke loses significant impact. Wilfred Jackson, who made the music for &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; in 1928, simply used a metronome to set the precise speed of the music for scenes: What I worked out, was a bar sheet (or dope sheet), to indicate measures of music. It wasn&#x27;t like a score, because it didn&#x27;t have five barlines; it had a little square for each beat in each measure, and it had an indication of the tempo. The frames were in the beat of the music; so in twelve-frame, or sixteen-frame, or whatever. That way, we were able to synchronise the scenes, which were shot separately, of course. My contribution to sound-cartoons were that I knew what a metronome was.

This system evolved with use. The Disney team experimented with additional graphical symbols, to better show the performing musicians when to expect happenings. This system was used well into the 1930s, when the first multitrack recording machine was built and dubbing became possible.

The click track was sufficiently useful as a synchronization tool that it became part of standard recording technology, whether for films, radio or other sound recording and the click track was applied to one of the tracks on a multitrack tape recorder. By the late 20th century, particularly in the realm of sound synthesizers and digital recording, the click track became computerized and synchronizing different instruments became more complex, whereupon the click track was largely supplanted by a SMPTE timecode.

Click tracks were also once very important in the creation of accurately timed music such as radio and television spots (commercials) and other timed production music. In this type of use a rhythm section or ensemble would play all instruments to a click track. With the use of MIDI sequencing in the 1980s and 1990s it became possible to build an entire music track that was accurately timed without depending solely on a click track. Computer based MIDI sequencing programs are still used in the creation of music. The MIDI sequencer generated track can be used with only MIDI controlled instruments or embellished with other instruments played by musicians. The musicians who embellish the tracks created with MIDI sequencer essentially play along with the already timed piece of music. In many cases all of the MIDI instrumentation is replaced by actual musicians.

==Techniques==

The click track may be used as a form of metronome directly by musicians in the studio or on stage, particularly by drummers, who listen via headphones to maintain a consistent beat. Sometimes the click track would be given, through a set of headphones, only to the drummer who would hold the beat, and the rest of the musicians on staff would follow along to the beat that the drummer would hold. One can think of a click track as essentially being a kind of metronome except that it is fed through headphones to one or more of the musicians during a recording or performance. It is also not uncommon for musicians or engineers to subdivide click tracks at slow tempos (for instance, below 70 BPM) into smaller parts, with, for instance a click on the start of a bar and a beep on every individual quarter (or eighth, sixteenth...) note. In the final product of the film or performance that is being recorded, the click track is not heard by the audience.

The practice of recording using an aiding click track is contrary to the practice of using a metronome during practice and then turning it off come time for a performance or recording, which has traditionally been more common in the past. The use of a click track allows for easier editing in a digital audio workstation (DAW) or music sequencer, since various parts can be easily quantized and moved around or spliced together without worrying about minute differences in timing. Click tracks are especially useful to modern &quot;one man bands&quot; who may use a multi-track audio editor to perform all or many of the different parts of a recording separately.

Click tracks can also aid live bands that want to synchronize a live performance with things like prerecorded backing tracks, pyrotechnics and stage lighting.

==Criticisms==
Use of a click track without a tempo map does not allow a natural shifting of tempo that would be vital for expressive phrasing and instances of fermata, accelerando, ritardando, etc.

James Beament, a scientist who studied acoustics, stated: 

Mark E. Smith, vocalist and leader of the UK musical group The Fall, was known to forbid use of click tracks in the recording studio. Simon Wolstencroft, drummer for The Fall in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, stated &quot;[Smith] hated it if the drums became too slick&quot; by synchronizing with a click track.

<text>Walter Scott Bradley (November 26, 1891 – April 27, 1977) was an American composer, pianist, arranger, and conductor.

Bradley is best remembered for scoring MGM&#x27;s theatrical cartoons, including those starring Tom and Jerry, Barney Bear, Screwy Squirrel, Droopy, George and Junior and many one-off cartoons.

==Career==
In an autobiographical sketch, Bradley noted that he began his career performing with and later conducting theatre orchestras in Houston, Texas. He studied organ and harmony with Horton Corbett, the choir director of Houston&#x27;s Christ Church Cathedral, but was &quot;otherwise entirely self-taught in composition and orchestration.&quot; (Years later, when he was already established in Hollywood, he sought to improve his technique by studying privately with MGM colleague Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco). In 1926, Bradley moved to Los Angeles to conduct programs over KHJ Radio, an activity that led to his growing involvement in animation at the start of the talkie era. He was a staff musician for Walt Disney (1929) and the Ub Iwerks studio (1930–1934), then became music director for Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising, who were hired to produce cartoon shorts for MGM. After MGM established its own cartoon studio in 1937, Bradley was hired permanently and remained with the company for twenty years.

During the 1930s, Bradley also composed music for the concert hall, including the tone poems &quot;The Valley of the White Poppies&quot; (1931), &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; (1932), and the oratorio &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; (1934), based on the poem by William Cullen Bryant. His most notable success was &quot;Cartoonia&quot; (1938), a four-movement orchestral suite of his MGM work, premiered by Pierre Monteux with the San Francisco Symphony. It was an early expression of Bradley&#x27;s belief that cartoon music was an art form of great potential.

As was common practice in scores for animation, Bradley&#x27;s early style incorporated fragments of popular and traditional melodies. By the mid-1940s, however, his compositions and orchestrations had become more original and complex, occasionally utilizing the twelve-tone technique devised by Arnold Schoenberg; the first being the 1944 Tom and Jerry cartoon &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Dog&quot;. Other influences were Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine quoted concertmaster Lou Raderman&#x27;s mock complaint: &quot;Scott writes the most &quot;blank-blank-blank&quot; difficult fiddle music in Hollywood … He is going to break my fingers!&quot; 

Bradley expressed considerable pride in his &quot;funny music&quot; and believed scoring for animation offered far more possibilities to the composer than live-action films. About his score for MGM&#x27;s &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Dog&quot;, he later wrote:

I hope Dr. Schoenberg will forgive me for using his system to produce funny music, but even the boys in the orchestra laughed when we were recording it.

The conductor Simon Rattle has specifically highlighted the influence of the Klaus-Narr passages in Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurrelieder&quot; on Bradley&#x27;s compositions.

In 1954, MGM terminated his weekly contract but retained his services as a freelancer, paying him $1,000 per film. This arrangement lasted until MGM closed its cartoon department in 1957, after which Bradley retired. He died on April 27, 1977, in Chatsworth, California, and is buried at Chatsworth&#x27;s Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery.

By the late 1980s, Bradley&#x27;s reputation had been overshadowed by that of his Warner Bros. counterpart Carl W. Stalling, but experienced a resurgence at the start of the 21st century. The first Bradley soundtrack album, &quot;Tom and Jerry &amp; Tex Avery Too!&quot;, received a limited-edition release in 2006 and the &quot;Cartoonia&quot; suite was revived in a performance by the Cleveland Youth Orchestra in 2012. The following year, &quot;Tom and Jerry at MGM&quot;, a six-minute orchestral suite of Bradley cues reconstructed by Peter Morris and John Wilson, received its world premiere at a BBC Proms concert in London. Simon Rattle chose also this suite for 2015 Waldbühne concert of the Berlin Philharmonic. Rattle presented it again in June 2018 at his last subscription concert of the Berlin Philharmonic as a chief conductor.

==Personal life==
Bradley married Myrtle Aber on December 2, 1934, in a small ceremony.

<doc id="146539" wikidata="Q2070979" url="?curid=146539" title="Senescence">
<text>Senescence () or biological aging is the gradual deterioration of functional characteristics in living organisms. Whole organism senescence involves an increase in death rates or a decrease in fecundity with increasing age, at least in the later part of an organism&#x27;s life cycle. However, the resulting effects of senescence can be delayed. The 1934 discovery that calorie restriction can extend lifespans by 50% in rats, the existence of species having negligible senescence, and the existence of potentially immortal organisms such as members of the genus &quot;Hydra&quot; have motivated research into delaying senescence and thus age-related diseases. Rare human mutations can cause accelerated aging diseases.

Environmental factors may affect aging – for example, overexposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging. Different parts of the body may age at different rates and distinctly, including the brain, the cardiovascular system, and muscle. Similarly, functions may distinctly decline with aging, including movement control and memory. Two organisms of the same species can also age at different rates, making biological aging and chronological aging distinct concepts.

==Definition and characteristics==
&quot;Organismal senescence&quot; is the aging of whole organisms. Actuarial senescence can be defined as an increase in mortality or a decrease in fecundity with age. The Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality says that the age-dependent component of the mortality rate increases exponentially with age.

Aging is characterized by the declining ability to respond to stress, increased homeostatic imbalance, and increased risk of aging-associated diseases including cancer and heart disease. Aging has been defined as &quot;a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability.&quot;

In 2013, a group of scientists defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals:
* genomic instability,
* telomere attrition,
* epigenetic alterations,
* loss of proteostasis,
* deregulated nutrient sensing,
* mitochondrial dysfunction,
* cellular senescence,
* stem cell exhaustion,
* altered intercellular communication

In a decadal update, three hallmarks have been added, totaling 12 proposed hallmarks: 
* disabled macroautophagy
* chronic inflammation
* dysbiosis&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.cell.2022.11.001&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment induces damage at various levels, e.g. damage to DNA, and damage to tissues and cells by oxygen radicals (widely known as free radicals), and some of this damage is not repaired and thus accumulates with time. Cloning from somatic cells rather than germ cells may begin life with a higher initial load of damage. Dolly the sheep died young from a contagious lung disease, but data on an entire population of cloned individuals would be necessary to measure mortality rates and quantify aging.

The evolutionary theorist George Williams wrote, &quot;It is remarkable that after a seemingly miraculous feat of morphogenesis, a complex metazoan should be unable to perform the much simpler task of merely maintaining what is already formed.&quot;

==Variation among species==

Different speeds with which mortality increases with age correspond to different maximum life span among species. For example, a mouse is elderly at 3 years, a human is elderly at 80 years, and ginkgo trees show little effect of age even at 667 years.

Almost all organisms senesce, including bacteria which have asymmetries between &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;daughter&quot; cells upon cell division, with the mother cell experiencing aging, while the daughter is rejuvenated. There is negligible senescence in some groups, such as the genus &quot;Hydra&quot;. Planarian flatworms have &quot;apparently limitless telomere regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells.&quot; These planarians are not biologically immortal, but rather their death rate slowly increases with age. Organisms that are thought to be biologically immortal would, in one instance, be &quot;Turritopsis&quot; &quot;dohrnii&quot;, also known as the &quot;immortal jellyfish&quot;, due to its ability to revert to its youth when it undergoes stress during adulthood. The reproductive system is observed to remain intact, and even the gonads of &quot;Turritopsis&quot; &quot;dohrnii&quot; are existing.

Some species exhibit &quot;negative senescence&quot;, in which reproduction capability increases or is stable, and mortality falls with age, resulting from the advantages of increased body size during aging.

== Theories of aging ==
More than 300 different theories have been posited to explain the nature (mechanisms) and causes (reasons for natural emergence or factors) of aging. Good theories would both explain past observations and predict the results of future experiments. Some of the theories may complement each other, overlap, contradict, or may not preclude various other theories.

Theories of aging fall into two broad categories, evolutionary theories of aging and mechanistic theories of aging. Evolutionary theories of aging primarily explain why aging happens, but do not concern themselves with the molecular mechanism(s) that drive the process. All evolutionary theories of aging rest on the basic mechanisms that the force of natural selection declines with age. Mechanistic theories of aging can be divided into theories that propose aging is programmed, and damage accumulation theories, i.e. those that propose aging to be caused by specific molecular changes occurring over time.

=== Evolutionary aging theories ===
====Antagonistic pleiotropy====

One theory was proposed by George C. Williams and involves antagonistic pleiotropy. A single gene may affect multiple traits. Some traits that increase fitness early in life may also have negative effects later in life. But, because many more individuals are alive at young ages than at old ages, even small positive effects early can be strongly selected for, and large negative effects later may be very weakly selected against. Williams suggested the following example: Perhaps a gene codes for calcium deposition in bones, which promotes juvenile survival and will therefore be favored by natural selection; however, this same gene promotes calcium deposition in the arteries, causing negative atherosclerotic effects in old age. Thus, harmful biological changes in old age may result from selection for pleiotropic genes that are beneficial early in life but harmful later on. In this case, selection pressure is relatively high when Fisher&#x27;s reproductive value is high and relatively low when Fisher&#x27;s reproductive value is low.

====Cancer versus cellular senescence tradeoff theory of aging====

Senescent cells within a multicellular organism can be purged by competition between cells, but this increases the risk of cancer. This leads to an inescapable dilemma between two possibilities—the accumulation of physiologically useless senescent cells, and cancer—both of which lead to increasing rates of mortality with age.

==== Disposable soma ====

The disposable soma theory of aging was proposed by Thomas Kirkwood in 1977. The theory suggests that aging occurs due to a strategy in which an individual only invests in maintenance of the soma for as long as it has a realistic chance of survival. A species that uses resources more efficiently will live longer, and therefore be able to pass on genetic information to the next generation. The demands of reproduction are high, so less effort is invested in repair and maintenance of somatic cells, compared to germline cells, in order to focus on reproduction and species survival.

=== Programmed aging theories ===
Programmed theories of aging posit that aging is adaptive, normally invoking selection for evolvability or group selection.

The reproductive-cell cycle theory suggests that aging is regulated by changes in hormonal signaling over the lifespan.

=== Damage accumulation theories ===

==== The free radical theory of aging ====

One of the most prominent theories of aging was first proposed by Harman in 1956. It posits that free radicals produced by dissolved oxygen, radiation, cellular respiration and other sources cause damage to the molecular machines in the cell and gradually wear them down. This is also known as oxidative stress.

There is substantial evidence to back up this theory. Old animals have larger amounts of oxidized proteins, DNA and lipids than their younger counterparts.

====Chemical damage====
One of the earliest aging theories was the &quot;Rate of Living Hypothesis&quot; described by Raymond Pearl in 1928 (based on earlier work by Max Rubner), which states that fast basal metabolic rate corresponds to short maximum life span.

While there may be some validity to the idea that for various types of specific damage detailed below that are by-products of metabolism, all other things being equal, a fast metabolism may reduce lifespan, in general this theory does not adequately explain the differences in lifespan either within, or between, species. Calorically restricted animals process as much, or more, calories per gram of body mass, as their &quot;ad libitum&quot; fed counterparts, yet exhibit substantially longer lifespans. Similarly, metabolic rate is a poor predictor of lifespan for birds, bats and other species that, it is presumed, have reduced mortality from predation, and therefore have evolved long lifespans even in the presence of very high metabolic rates. In a 2007 analysis it was shown that, when modern statistical methods for correcting for the effects of body size and phylogeny are employed, metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in mammals or birds.

With respect to specific types of chemical damage caused by metabolism, it is suggested that damage to long-lived biopolymers, such as structural proteins or DNA, caused by ubiquitous chemical agents in the body such as oxygen and sugars, are in part responsible for aging. The damage can include breakage of biopolymer chains, cross-linking of biopolymers, or chemical attachment of unnatural substituents (haptens) to biopolymers.
Under normal conditions, approximately 4% of the oxygen metabolized by mitochondria is converted to superoxide ion, which can subsequently be converted to hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and eventually other reactive species including other peroxides and singlet oxygen, which can, in turn, generate free radicals capable of damaging structural proteins and DNA. Certain metal ions found in the body, such as copper and iron, may participate in the process. (In Wilson&#x27;s disease, a hereditary defect that causes the body to retain copper, some of the symptoms resemble accelerated senescence.) These processes termed oxidative stress are linked to the potential benefits of dietary polyphenol antioxidants, for example in coffee, and tea. However their typically positive effects on lifespans when consumption is moderate have also been explained by effects on autophagy, glucose metabolism and AMPK.

Sugars such as glucose and fructose can react with certain amino acids such as lysine and arginine and certain DNA bases such as guanine to produce sugar adducts, in a process called &quot;glycation&quot;. These adducts can further rearrange to form reactive species, which can then cross-link the structural proteins or DNA to similar biopolymers or other biomolecules such as non-structural proteins. People with diabetes, who have elevated blood sugar, develop senescence-associated disorders much earlier than the general population, but can delay such disorders by rigorous control of their blood sugar levels. There is evidence that sugar damage is linked to oxidant damage in a process termed &quot;glycoxidation&quot;.

Free radicals can damage proteins, lipids or DNA. Glycation mainly damages proteins. Damaged proteins and lipids accumulate in lysosomes as lipofuscin. Chemical damage to structural proteins can lead to loss of function; for example, damage to collagen of blood vessel walls can lead to vessel-wall stiffness and, thus, hypertension, and vessel wall thickening and reactive tissue formation (atherosclerosis); similar processes in the kidney can lead to kidney failure. Damage to enzymes reduces cellular functionality. Lipid peroxidation of the inner mitochondrial membrane reduces the electric potential and the ability to generate energy. It is probably no accident that nearly all of the so-called &quot;accelerated aging diseases&quot; are due to defective DNA repair enzymes.

It is believed that the impact of alcohol on aging can be partly explained by alcohol&#x27;s activation of the HPA axis, which stimulates glucocorticoid secretion, long-term exposure to which produces symptoms of aging.

====DNA damage====

DNA damage was proposed in a 2021 review to be the underlying cause of aging because of the mechanistic link of DNA damage to nearly every aspect of the aging phenotype. Slower rate of accumulation of DNA damage as measured by the DNA damage marker gamma H2AX in leukocytes was found to correlate with longer lifespans in comparisons of dolphins, goats, reindeer, American flamingos and griffon vultures. DNA damage-induced epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and many histone modifications, appear to be of particular importance to the aging process. Evidence for the theory that DNA damage is the fundamental cause of aging was first reviewed in 1981.

====Mutation accumulation====

Natural selection can support lethal and harmful alleles, if their effects are felt after reproduction. The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane wondered why the dominant mutation that causes Huntington&#x27;s disease remained in the population, and why natural selection had not eliminated it. The onset of this neurological disease is (on average) at age 45 and is invariably fatal within 10–20 years. Haldane assumed that, in human prehistory, few survived until age 45. Since few were alive at older ages and their contribution to the next generation was therefore small relative to the large cohorts of younger age groups, the force of selection against such late-acting deleterious mutations was correspondingly small. Therefore, a genetic load of late-acting deleterious mutations could be substantial at mutation–selection balance. This concept came to be known as the selection shadow.

Peter Medawar formalised this observation in his mutation accumulation theory of aging. &quot;The force of natural selection weakens with increasing age—even in a theoretically immortal population, provided only that it is exposed to real hazards of mortality. If a genetic disaster... happens late enough in individual life, its consequences may be completely unimportant&quot;. Age-independent hazards such as predation, disease, and accidents, called &#x27;extrinsic mortality&#x27;, mean that even a population with negligible senescence will have fewer individuals alive in older age groups.

==== Other damage ====
A study concluded that retroviruses in the human genomes can become awakened from dormant states and contribute to aging which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies, alleviating &quot;cellular senescence and tissue degeneration and, to some extent, organismal aging&quot;.

==Biomarkers of aging==
If different individuals age at different rates, then fecundity, mortality, and functional capacity might be better predicted by biomarkers than by chronological age. However, graying of hair, face aging, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. Biogerontologists have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited.

Levels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.

=== Aging clocks ===
There is interest in an epigenetic clock as a biomarker of aging, based on its ability to predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age. It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using transcriptomic aging clocks.

There is research and development of further biomarkers, detection systems and software systems to measure biological age of different tissues or systems or overall. For example, a deep learning (DL) software using anatomic magnetic resonance images estimated brain age with relatively high accuracy, including detecting early signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and varying neuroanatomical patterns of neurological aging, and a DL tool was reported as to calculate a person&#x27;s inflammatory age based on patterns of systemic age-related inflammation.

Aging clocks have been used to evaluate impacts of interventions on humans, including combination therapies. Employing aging clocks to identify and evaluate longevity interventions represents a fundamental goal in aging biology research. However, achieving this goal requires overcoming numerous challenges and implementing additional validation steps.

==Genetic determinants of aging==
A number of genetic components of aging have been identified using model organisms, ranging from the simple budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; to worms such as &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; and fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;). Study of these organisms has revealed the presence of at least two conserved aging pathways.

Gene expression is imperfectly controlled, and it is possible that random fluctuations in the expression levels of many genes contribute to the aging process as suggested by a study of such genes in yeast. Individual cells, which are genetically identical, nonetheless can have substantially different responses to outside stimuli, and markedly different lifespans, indicating the epigenetic factors play an important role in gene expression and aging as well as genetic factors. There is research into epigenetics of aging.

The ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks declines with aging in mice and humans.

A set of rare hereditary (genetics) disorders, each called progeria, has been known for some time. Sufferers exhibit symptoms resembling accelerated aging, including wrinkled skin. The cause of Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome was reported in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2003.
This report suggests that DNA damage, not oxidative stress, is the cause of this form of accelerated aging.

A study indicates that aging may shift activity toward short genes or shorter transcript length and that this can be countered by interventions.

== Healthspans and aging in society ==

Healthspan can broadly be defined as the period of one&#x27;s life that one is healthy, such as free of significant diseases or declines of capacities (e.g. of senses, muscle, endurance and cognition).
 Biological aging or the LHG comes with a great cost burden to society, including potentially rising health care costs (also depending on types and costs of treatments). This, along with global quality of life or wellbeing, highlight the importance of extending healthspans.

Many measures that may extend lifespans may simultaneously also extend healthspans, albeit that is not necessarily the case, indicating that &quot;lifespan can no longer be the sole parameter of interest&quot; in related research. While recent life expectancy increases were not followed by &quot;parallel&quot; healthspan expansion, awareness of the concept and issues of healthspan lags as of 2017. Scientists have noted that &quot;[c]hronic diseases of aging are increasing and are inflicting untold costs on human quality of life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.tcb.2016.05.002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="146540" wikidata="Q5932" url="?curid=146540" title="Friesland (district)">
<text>Friesland is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southeast and clockwise) the districts of Wesermarsch, Ammerland, Leer and Wittmund, and by the North Sea. The city of Wilhelmshaven is enclosed by—but not part of—the district.

==History==
The Frisian region was ruled by local chieftains until the 15th century; see East Frisia for details.

In 1438 in the northern part of today&#x27;s Landkreis Friesland the Lordship of Jever was founded. East Frisia was from then on regarded as a hostile territory, and many skirmishes between Jever and East Frisia took place during the 15th and 16th centuries. The last ruler of Jever was Mary of Jever, who ruled until 1575.

After her death Jever became a part of Oldenburg, but East Frisia made a claim for the territory as well. In the following decades East Frisia tried to block all roads between Jever and Oldenburg. It was not before the 17th century that the hostilities between East Frisia and Oldenburg ended.

From 1667 to 1793 Jever was an exclave of Anhalt-Zerbst, and after Napoleonic occupation the westernmost exclave of Prussia. In 1818 Jever became a part of Oldenburg again.

The southern part of today&#x27;s District of Friesland is the &quot;Friesische Wehde&quot; (&quot;Frisian Woods&quot;), which also was most of the time part of Oldenburg. This region later formed the District of Varel.

The District was established in 1933 by merging the former districts of Jever and Varel under the name of &quot;Friesland&quot;. In 1977 it was dissolved and divided between the neighbouring districts of Wittmund and Ammerland. The dissolution was declared unconstitutional in 1979 because it violated the rights of the former State of Oldenburg, and the District was re-established in its old boundaries in 1980.

Friesland is also a province in the northwest of the Netherlands.

==Geography==
In the east the district is bounded by the Jade Bight, a shallow bay of the North Sea. The island of Wangerooge, one of the East Frisian Islands, is a part of Friesland.

The inhabitants of Friesland insist that they are not a part of East Frisia. This is somewhat confusing, since Friesland is situated east of East Frisia, and geographers regard Friesland as a part of that region. The distinction has historical reasons: Friesland was an independent state from 1438 to 1575 (see above for details). Then and afterwards the region bore the name &quot;Friesland&quot;, although this is also the German name for the entire Frisia.

Part of the District is in the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park.

==Coat of arms==

The lion is from the arms of the chieftains of Jever; it was the symbol of the Lordship of Jever. The blazon of the arms is: &quot;Azure, a lion rampant Or, armed and langued Gules, and in chief two Greek crosses Argent&quot;.

<doc id="146541" wikidata="Q602196" url="?curid=146541" title="Type XXIII submarine">
<text>German Type XXIII submarines were the first so-called elektroboote (&quot;electric boats&quot;) to become operational. They were small coastal submarines designed to operate in the shallow waters of the North Sea, Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea, where larger Type XXI electric boats were at risk in World War II. They were so small they could carry only two torpedoes, which had to be loaded externally. As with their far larger sisters—the Type XXI—they were able to remain submerged almost all of the time and were faster than conventional U-boats, due to the improved streamlining of their shape, batteries with larger capacity and the snorkel, which allowed the diesel engines to be used while submerged. The Type XXI and XXIII U-boats revolutionized post-war submarine design. Nearly a thousand Type XXIII boats were projected towards the close of World War II, but most of these were either cancelled, scrapped incomplete, or only projected.

==Background==
When development began on the Type XXI U-boat in late 1942, it was proposed to simultaneously develop a smaller version incorporating the same advanced technology to replace the Type II coastal submarine. Admiral Karl Dönitz added two requirements: as the boat would have to operate in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, it had to be able to be transported by rail, and it had to use the standard torpedo tubes.

The development of the Type XXIII was given a high priority, with an emphasis on using existing components as much as possible. To reduce development time, Hellmuth Walter designed the new submarine based on the previous Type XXII prototype. By 30 June 1943 the design was ready and construction began in parallel at several shipyards in Germany, France, Italy and Ukraine. The lead contractor was Deutsche Werft in Hamburg.

As with the Type XXI, the Type XXIII was intended to be constructed in sections, various modules being produced by different subcontractors. Some were to be assembled at foreign yards, including &quot;U-2446&quot; through &quot;U-2460&quot; at the Deutsche Werft yard at Nikolaev, Southern Ukraine. These were reassigned to the Linzner yard on 1 May 1944 and subsequently cancelled. In the end, circumstances meant that construction was concentrated at Germaniawerft in Kiel and Deutsche Werft in Hamburg, Germaniawerft building 51 and Deutsche Werft 49. Of the 280 submarines ordered, only 61 entered service, and only 6 ever carried out a war patrol.

==Description==
The Type XXIII had an all-welded single hull, the first submarine to use such a design. It had a fully streamlined outer casing and apart from the relatively small conning tower and a fairing which housed the diesel exhaust silencer, it had an uncluttered upper deck. In line with Walter&#x27;s design practice, there were no forward hydroplanes, although these were added later.

The submarine was propelled by a single three-bladed propeller and steered by a single rudder. As with the Type XXI, the lower section of the figure-of-eight hull was used to house a large 62-cell battery.

In order to allow the boat to be transported by rail, the hull sections had to be limited in size to fit the standard loading gauge. For transportation, the hull was broken into four sections and the bridge was removed. Due to the space restrictions, the forward bow section had to be made as short as possible, which meant that only two torpedo tubes could be fitted and no reload torpedoes could be carried. The torpedoes were loaded by ballasting the submarine down at the stern so that the bow lifted clear of the water and the torpedoes could be loaded directly into their tubes from a barge.
The Type XXIII proved to have excellent handling characteristics, and was highly maneuverable both on the surface and underwater. Its crash dive time was 9 seconds, and its maximum diving depth was . Submerged, its speed was , and while surfaced its speed was . A submerged speed of could be attained while snorkeling.

==Construction==
The first forty-nine boats (&quot;U-2321&quot; to &quot;U-2331&quot;, and &quot;U-2334&quot; to &quot;U-2371&quot;) were ordered from Deutsche Werft, Hamburg, while two (&quot;U-2332&quot; and &quot;U-2333&quot;) were ordered from Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft&#x27;s yard at Kiel. Twenty-nine further boats (&quot;U-2372&quot; to &quot;U-2400&quot;) were ordered from Deutsche Werft&#x27;s wartime occupied yards at Toulon, but the first nine of these were scrapped incomplete on the stocks and the remainder never commenced.

Another sixty were ordered to be built by the company at other yards in occupied nations - thirty at Genoa (&quot;U-2401&quot; to &quot;U-2430&quot;), fifteen at Monfalcone (&quot;U-2431&quot; to &quot;U-2445&quot;) and another fifteen at Nikolaev and Linz (&quot;U-2446&quot; to &quot;U-2460&quot;), where a further forty (&quot;U-2461&quot; to &quot;U-2500&quot;) were projected but never ordered. All of these were cancelled and never commenced.

Eight hundred additional units were intended to be built by Deutsche Werft - five hundred at Hamburg (&quot;U-4001&quot; to &quot;U-4500&quot;), of which the first 120 were ordered and started were subsequently scrapped incomplete, with the others cancelled and never begun; and three hundred at Kiel (&quot;U-4701&quot; to &quot;U-5000&quot;), where eleven (&quot;U-4701&quot; to &quot;U-4712&quot; , exclude &quot;U-4708&quot;) were actually built (orders for &quot;U-4713&quot; to &quot;U-4891&quot; were cancelled, while &quot;U-4892&quot; to &quot;U-5000&quot; were projected only).

The first Type XXIII, , was launched from Deutsche Werft in Hamburg on 17 April 1944. It was one of six XXIIIs that went on operational patrol around the British Isles in early 1945. Forty-eight others followed from Deutsche Werft and fourteen from Germaniawerft of Kiel. was the last one launched, on 1 March 1945.

==Service history==
None of the six operational Type XXIIIs - , , , , and - were sunk by the Allies&#x27; ships but they sank four ships for a total of .

The first war patrol of a Type XXIII began when &quot;U-2324&quot; sailed from Kiel on 18 January 1945. Although she was to survive the war, she sank no enemy vessels. The first Type XXIII to achieve combat success was &quot;U-2322&quot;, commanded by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Fridtjof Heckel. Sailing from a Norwegian base on 6 February 1945, she encountered a convoy off Berwick-upon-Tweed, and sank the coaster &quot;Egholm&quot; on 25 February. &quot;U-2321&quot;, operating from the same base, sank the coaster &quot;Gasray&quot; on 5 April 1945 off St Abbs Head. &quot;U-2336&quot;, under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Emil Klusmeier, sank the last Allied ships lost in the European war on 7 May 1945, when she torpedoed the freighters &quot;Sneland I&quot; and off the Isle of May inside the Firth of Forth.

The &quot;Sneland I&quot; and the &quot;Avondale Park&quot; were sunk around 23:03, less than an hour before the official German surrender, and the &quot;Avondale Park&quot; was the last merchant ship to be sunk by a U-boat. At the time it was felt that Kapitänleutnant Klusmeier, who was on his first patrol, had deliberately ignored Dönitz&#x27;s ceasefire order; Klusmeier claimed that he had never received the order.

==Losses==
Seven Type XXIIIs were lost to various causes.
* was sunk by a naval mine on 26 July 1944.
* was lost in a training accident on 10 October 1944.
* was sunk by British Beaufighter aircraft which killed 12 crewmen and sank the boat east-northeast of Fredericia in Denmark on 4 May 1945, before she ever went on combat patrol.
* was mined and sunk on 26 December 1944.
* was accidentally rammed and sunk by on 18 February 1945.
* was sunk by Allied aircraft on 2 May 1945.
* was accidentally rammed and sunk by an unidentified U-boat on 5 May 1945.

In early May 1945, 31 XXIIIs were scuttled by their crews. 20 surrendered to the Allies and were sunk in Operation Deadlight. Only 3 – (later British submarine &quot;N35&quot;), (later British submarine &quot;N31&quot;, then Soviet submarine &quot;M-51&quot;), and (later Norwegian submarine &quot;Knerter&quot;) – survived the war.

==Postwar==
One Type XXIII was allocated to the Soviet Union under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement, and a second unit was reportedly salvaged in 1948.

In 1956, the Bundesmarine raised two Type XXIII boats, &quot;U-2365&quot; (scuttled in the Kattegat in 1945) and &quot;U-2367&quot; (which sank near following a collision with another U-boat), and recommissioned them as &quot;U-Hai&quot; (Shark) and &quot;U-Hecht&quot; (Pike), with pennant numbers S 170 and S 171 respectively. &quot;U-Hai&quot; sank in a gale off the Dogger Bank in September 1966, taking 19 of her 20 crewmen with her. Her loss is the greatest maritime post-war disaster that the German Navy has suffered. The experience gained from the two recommissioned submarines led to the construction of the Type 206 submarine, which was in use until 2011.

==Boats in class==
Although a total of 980 Type XXIII submarines were planned, many were scrapped incomplete (or indeed never ordered in many cases), only the following 61 vessels were built:

<doc id="146549" wikidata="Q5559684" url="?curid=146549" title="Gideon v. Wainwright">
<text>Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires U.S. states to provide attorneys to criminal defendants who are unable to afford their own. The case extended the right to counsel, which had been found under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to impose requirements on the federal government, by imposing those requirements upon the states as well.

The Court reasoned that the assistance of counsel is &quot;one of the safeguards of the Sixth Amendment deemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty&quot;, and that the Sixth Amendment serves as a warning that &quot;if the constitutional safeguards it provides be lost, justice will not still be done.&quot;

==Background==
Between midnight and 8:00 a.m. on June 3, 1961, a burglary occurred at the Bay Harbor Pool Room in Panama City, Florida. An unknown person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole money from a cash register. Later that day, a witness reported that he had seen Clarence Earl Gideon in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a wine bottle, a Coca-Cola, and some change in his pockets. Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty larceny. 

Gideon appeared in court alone, as he was too poor to afford to hire a defense lawyer. The following conversation took place between Gideon and the judge:

The trial court declined to appoint counsel for Gideon. As a result, he was forced to act as his own counsel and conduct his own defense in court, emphasizing his innocence in the case. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The court sentenced Gideon to serve five years in the state prison.

Gideon first filed a petition for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the Supreme Court of Florida. In his petition, he claimed his Sixth Amendment right had been violated because the judge refused to appoint counsel. The Florida Supreme Court denied Gideon&#x27;s petition. Later, from his cell at the Florida State Prison in Raiford, making use of the prison library and writing in pencil on prison stationery, Gideon appealed to the United States Supreme Court in a suit against the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections, H. G. Cochran. Cochran retired and was replaced by Louie L. Wainwright before the Supreme Court heard the case. Gideon argued in his appeal that he had been denied counsel and therefore that his Sixth Amendment rights, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, had been violated.

The Supreme Court assigned Gideon a prominent Washington, D.C. attorney, future Supreme Court justice Abe Fortas of the law firm Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter. Fortas was assisted by longtime Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter partner Abe Krash and future famed legal scholar John Hart Ely, then a third-year student at Yale Law School. Bruce Jacob, who later became Dean of the Mercer University School of Law and Dean of Stetson University College of Law, argued the case for Florida.

During oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Fortas repeatedly asserted that the existing framework for a state trial court to appoint counsel was unworkable. Under the existing framework, a magistrate in a preliminary hearing determined whether there were &quot;special circumstances&quot; in the case meriting that the defendant receive counsel. But as Fortas highlighted, that determination occurred too early in the case to be of any use. For example, whether a witness&#x27;s statement should be barred because it was hearsay is an extremely complicated issue that no layman could readily confront, and such a situation arises only during a trial.

As a second point, Fortas presented during oral argument that it was widely accepted in the legal community that the first thing any reputable lawyer does when accused of a crime is hire an attorney. As an example, Fortas noted that when Clarence Darrow, who was widely known as the greatest criminal attorney in the United States, was charged with jury tampering and suborning perjury, the first thing he did was get an attorney to represent him. Since Gideon had only an eighth-grade education, Fortas suggested that if a lawyer as prominent as Darrow needed an attorney to represent him in criminal proceedings, then a man without a legal education, or any education for that matter, needed a lawyer too. Fortas&#x27;s former Yale Law School professor, longtime friend and future Supreme Court colleague Justice William O. Douglas praised his argument as &quot;probably the best single legal argument&quot; in his 36 years on the court.

==Court decision==

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision was announced on March 18, 1963, and delivered by Justice Hugo Black. The decision was announced as being unanimous in favor of Gideon. Two concurring opinions were written by Justices Clark and Harlan. Justice Douglas wrote a separate opinion. The Supreme Court decision specifically cited its previous ruling in &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot; (1932). Whether the decision in &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot; applied to non-capital cases had sparked heated debate. &quot;Betts v. Brady&quot; (1942) had earlier held that, unless certain circumstances were present, such as illiteracy or low intelligence of the defendant, or an especially complicated case, there was no need for a court-appointed attorney in state court criminal proceedings. &quot;Betts&quot; had thus provided the selective application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the states, depending on the circumstances, as the Sixth Amendment had only been held binding in federal cases. &quot;Gideon&quot; overruled &quot;Betts&quot;, holding that the assistance of counsel, if desired by a defendant who could not afford to hire counsel, was a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, binding on the states, and essential for a fair trial and due process of law regardless of the circumstances of the case. The Court explained its rationale in these words:

Clark&#x27;s concurring opinion stated that the Sixth Amendment does not distinguish between capital and non-capital cases, so legal counsel must be provided for an indigent defendant in all cases. Harlan&#x27;s concurring opinion stated that the mere existence of a serious criminal charge in itself constituted special circumstances requiring the services of counsel at trial.

&quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; was one of a series of Supreme Court decisions that confirmed the right of defendants in criminal proceedings, upon request, to have counsel appointed both during the trial and on appeal. In the subsequent cases &quot;Massiah v. United States,&quot; 377 U.S. 201 (1964), and &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Supreme Court further extended the rule to apply during police interrogation.

==Implications==

About 2,000 people were freed in Florida alone as a result of the &quot;Gideon&quot; decision. The decision did not directly result in Gideon being freed; instead, he received a new trial with the appointment of defense counsel at the government&#x27;s expense.

Gideon chose W. Fred Turner to be his lawyer in his second trial. The retrial took place on August 5, 1963, five months after the Supreme Court ruling. During the trial, Turner picked apart the testimony of eyewitness Henry Cook. In his opening and closing statements, Turner suggested that Cook likely had been a lookout for a group of young men who broke into the poolroom to steal beer and then grabbed the coins while they were there. Turner also obtained a statement from a cab driver who had taken Gideon from Bay Harbor to a bar in Panama City, stating that Gideon was carrying neither wine, beer, nor Coca-Cola when he picked him up, even though Cook testified that he had watched Gideon walk from the pool hall to a payphone and then wait for a cab. This testimony completely discredited Cook.

The jury acquitted Gideon after one hour of deliberation. After his acquittal, Gideon resumed his previous life and married sometime later. He died of cancer in Fort Lauderdale on January 18, 1972, at age 61. Gideon&#x27;s family in Missouri accepted his body and laid him to rest in an unmarked grave. A granite headstone was added later. It was inscribed with a quote from a letter Gideon wrote to Abe Fortas, the attorney appointed to represent him in the Supreme Court: &quot;Each era finds an improvement in law for the benefit of mankind.&quot;

===Impact on courts===
The former &quot;incorrect trial&quot; rule, where the government was given a fair amount of latitude in criminal proceedings as long as there were no &quot;shocking departures from fair procedure&quot;, was discarded in favor of a firm set of &quot;procedural guarantees&quot; based on the Constitution. The court reversed &quot;Betts&quot; and adopted rules that did not require a case-by-case analysis, but instead established the requirement of appointed counsel as a matter of right, without a defendant&#x27;s having to show &quot;special circumstances&quot; that justified the appointment of counsel. In this way, the case helped to refine &quot;stare decisis&quot;: when a prior appellate court decision should be upheld and what standard should be applied to test a new case against case precedent to achieve acceptable practice and due process of law.

====Public defender system====
Many changes have been made in the prosecution and legal representation of indigent defendants since the &quot;Gideon&quot; decision. The decision created and then expanded the need for public defenders, which had previously been rare. For example, immediately following the decision, Florida required public defenders in all of its circuit courts.

The need for more public defenders also led to a need to ensure that they were properly trained in criminal defense, in order to allow defendants to receive as fair a trial as possible. Several states and counties followed suit. Washington, D.C., for instance, has created a training program for their public defenders, who must receive rigorous training before they are allowed to represent defendants, and must continue their training in order to remain current in criminal law, procedure, and practices. In 2010, a public defender&#x27;s office in the South Bronx, The Bronx Defenders, created the Center for Holistic Defense, which has helped many state public defender offices and developed a model of public defense called holistic defense or holistic advocacy. In it, criminal defense attorneys work on interdisciplinary teams, alongside civil attorneys, social workers, and legal advocates to help clients with not only direct but also collateral aspects of their criminal cases. More recently the American Bar Association and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association have set minimum training requirements, caseload levels, and experience requirements for defenders.

There is often controversy about whether public defenders&#x27; caseloads give them enough time to defend their clients adequately. Some criticize public defenders for encouraging their clients to plead guilty. Some defenders say this is intended to lessen their own workload, while others say it is intended to obtain a lighter sentence by negotiating a plea bargain as compared with going to trial and risking a harsher sentence. Tanya Greene, an ACLU lawyer, has said that that is why 90% to 95% of defendants plead guilty: &quot;You&#x27;ve got so many cases, limited resources, and there&#x27;s no relief. You go to work, you get more cases. You have to triage.&quot;

=== Cause of the civil right to counsel movement ===

&quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; marked a key transition in legal aid in the United States. Before &quot;Gideon&quot;, civil litigants were able to access counsel only based on the following three stringent criteria: whether the case had implications for a private corporation; whether their not receiving counsel would render the trial unfair or in some way compromised in procedure; and whether the case affected the government&#x27;s interests. 

After &quot;Gideon&quot;, and amid growing concern about the paucity of resources for poverty lawyering and the resource burden of case-by-case counsel determinations, state judges and legislators saw the benefit of ensuring the right to counsel for civil litigants just as Gideon provided for criminal defendants. Additionally, an influential 1997 article by a federal district court judge helped revitalize the conversation about the need and justification for a right to counsel in civil cases.

In contrast to the self-representation movement, the historical civil right to counsel movement was founded on the premise that systemic representation by counsel &quot;ensures more accurate outcomes in civil cases&quot;. Proponents of the movement also argue that a right to counsel &quot;saves federal and state government money by helping to avoid the negative externalities caused by litigants wrongly losing their civil cases (such as increased use of shelters, emergency medical care, foster care, police, and public benefits), and increases the public&#x27;s faith and investment in the judicial process&quot;.

While the movement has gained substantial traction over time (for instance, 18 jurisdictions enacted a right to counsel for tenants facing eviction between 2017 and 2022), some of its opponents have argued that it places an unreasonable financial burden on states that have an inadequate understanding of the costs and resources needed for civil counsel. Others argue that the right may lead to constitutionally inadequate representation, as has happened in criminal cases. One judge said that, post-&quot;Gideon&quot;, &quot;many defendants were represented only by &#x27;walking violations of the Sixth Amendment&#x27; [...] No constitutional right is celebrated so much in the abstract and observed so little in reality as the right to counsel&quot;. Since publicly financed counsel is not supported financially by the client, there is no guarantee that the appointed counsel will be adequately trained and experienced in the legal domain they are representing.

==== Civil right to counsel: influence on policy and aid provision ====
The movement along with the strong correlation between representation and equitable outcomes for low-income litigants in poverty lawyership scholarship has significantly influenced the policies surrounding legal representation. For example, in 2006, the American Bar Association adopted Resolution 112A, urging jurisdictions to provide legal counsel &quot;as a matter of right at public expense to low-income persons in those categories of adversarial proceedings where basic human needs are at stake&quot;. Outside of influencing policy, the civil right to counsel movement has fueled approaches to legal aid that aim to alleviate the financial burden civil litigants face. Aid through lawyer substitutes has become more prevalent, involving non-lawyer professionals who can assist clients in legal matters without the supervision of a certified attorney. Similarly, pro bono legal aid, which involves providing legal services without fees in order to promote public good, has gained prominence.

===Waiving the right to counsel===
&quot;Doughty v. Maxwell&quot; demonstrates the differences between how states and the federal government address standards for waiver of the right to counsel. In this case, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the decision of the Ohio court in &quot;Doughty&quot;, which held that regardless of &quot;Gideon&quot;, the defendant waived their right to appointed counsel by entering a plea of guilty. The underlying alleged crime and trial in &quot;Doughty&quot; took place in Ohio, which had its own way of interpreting the right to counsel, as do many states. Pennsylvania and West Virginia also deemed that the right to counsel was waived when a plea of guilty was entered. Depending upon one&#x27;s viewpoint, rules such as these could be seen as an attempt by a state to establish reasonable rules in criminal cases or as an attempt to save money even at the expense of denying a defendant due process. This varies a great deal from federal law, which generally has stricter guidelines for waiving the right to counsel. An analogous area of criminal law is the circumstances under which a criminal defendant can waive the right to trial. Under federal law, the defendant can only waive their right to trial if it is clear that the defendant understands the &quot;charges, the consequences of the various pleas, and the availability of counsel&quot;. State laws on the subject are often less strict, making it easier for prosecutors to obtain a defendant&#x27;s waiver of the right to trial.

==Criticism==
In &quot;Garza v. Idaho&quot;, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, filed a dissenting opinion suggesting &quot;Gideon&quot; was wrongly decided and should be overruled. Justice Samuel Alito joined part of the dissent, but did not join the call to overturn &quot;Gideon&quot;.

<doc id="146550" wikidata="Q431917" url="?curid=146550" title="Hogan's Heroes">
<text>Hogan&#x27;s Heroes is an American television sitcom created by Bernard Fein and Albert S. Ruddy which is set in a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp in Nazi Germany during World War II, and centers around a group of Allied prisoners who use the POW camp as an operations base for sabotage and espionage activities directed against Nazi Germany. It ran for 168 episodes (six seasons) from September 17, 1965, to April 4, 1971, on the CBS network, and has been broadcast in reruns ever since.

Bob Crane starred as Colonel Robert E. Hogan, coordinating an international crew of Allied prisoners covertly running a special operations group from the camp. Werner Klemperer played Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the obtuse and oblivious commandant of the camp, and John Banner played the gullible but affable sergeant-of-the-guard Hans Schultz.

==Overview==
&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; centers on U.S. Army Air Forces Colonel Robert Hogan and his staff of experts who are prisoners of war (POW) during World War II. The plot occurs during the permanent winter season in the fictionalized Stalag 13 just outside Hammelburg in Nazi Germany, though details in the show are inconsistent with the real-life camp and city&#x27;s location in Franconia.

According to a title overlay, the pilot episode takes place in 1942. According to subsequent storylines, when the group was formed under Hogan&#x27;s command, he (and they) received the following orders: &quot;You will assist escaping prisoners, cooperate with all friendly forces, and use every means to harass and injure the enemy.&quot; Hogan recites those orders verbatim, from memory in the Season 3 episode &quot;The Collector General&quot;.

Pursuant to those orders, the group secretly uses the camp to conduct Allied espionage and sabotage and to help escaped Allied POWs from other prison camps via a secret network of tunnels that operate under the inept nose of commandant Klink.

The prisoners cooperate with resistance groups (collectively called &quot;the Underground&quot;), defectors, spies, counterspies, and disloyal German officers to accomplish this. The prisoners sometimes bribe or blackmail otherwise-loyal German officers so as to effectively manipulate their actions. Under Hogan&#x27;s leadership, the prisoners also devise schemes such as having Sergeant Carter visit the camp disguised as Adolf Hitler as a distraction, or rescuing a French Underground agent from Gestapo headquarters in Paris.

To the bafflement of his German colleagues who know him as an incompetent sycophant, Klink technically has a perfect operational record as camp commandant as no prisoners have successfully escaped during his tenure. Hogan and his men assist in maintaining this record so they can continue with their covert operations without active interference from the German military.

Considering Klink&#x27;s record, and the fact that the Allies would never bomb a POW camp, Stalag 13 appears to be a very secure location. As a result, the Germans often use the camp for high-level meetings, to hide important persons and develop secret projects. Klink frequently has many other important visitors and is temporarily put in charge of special prisoners.

This brings the prisoners into contact with many important VIPs, scientists, spies, high-ranking officers, and some of Germany&#x27;s most sophisticated and secret weapons projects such as the Wunderwaffe and the German nuclear weapons program, of which the prisoners take advantage in their efforts to hinder the German war effort.

===Setting===
The setting is the fictional &quot;Luft Stalag&quot; 13, a prisoner-of-war camp for captured Allied airmen. Like the historical Stalag XIII-C, it is located just outside a town called Hammelburg, although its location in the show is fictional, and does not correspond to the location of the actual Hammelburg. There are frequent references throughout the series to Düsseldorf being the nearest large city, and Düsseldorf is much farther northwest. In the season 1 episode, &quot;German Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;, Hogan points to a map, and he is clearly pointing to NW Germany. (If anything, even farther north than Düsseldorf.)

The show is a combination of several writing styles that were popular in the 1960s: the &quot;wartime&quot; show, the &quot;spy&quot; show, and &quot;camp comedy&quot;. 

The camp has 103 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) during the first season, but becomes larger by the end of the series. Few inmates have significant roles in the storylines other than the featured cast members.

In Stalag 13, there are always patches of snow. Beyond recreating an extreme or adverse setting, this was to prevent problems with continuity and to allow the episodes to be shown in any order. Episodes with obvious non-winter settings, such as &quot;D-Day at Stalag 13,&quot; either did not film any scene on the outdoor set or were careful not to show any &quot;snow.&quot;

==Characters==

* Bob Crane as U.S. Colonel Robert E. Hogan, the senior ranking POW officer and the leader of the men in the POW camp. He uses his wit and ingenuity to commit sabotage and obtain military information. Crane was offered the role after appearing as &quot;guy next door&quot; types in television shows like &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and as a regular in &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;.
* Werner Klemperer as German Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the commandant of the POW camp. He is completely unaware of Hogan&#x27;s operation and is proud the camp has a perfect no-escape record under his command. In real life, Klemperer was from a Jewish family (his father was the orchestral conductor Otto Klemperer) and found the role to be a &quot;double-edged sword&quot;; his agent initially failed to tell him the role of Klink was intended to be comedic. Klemperer remarked, &quot;I had one qualification when I took the job: if they ever wrote a segment whereby Colonel Klink would come out the hero, I would leave the show.&quot;
* John Banner as German Sergeant Hans Schultz, the camp&#x27;s first sergeant. He is a clumsy and inept, but extremely affable man who often gives out information to the prisoners for bribes, or simply by talking too much, without realizing he is giving away information. Hogan and his men frequently plot or perform their subversive activities in plain sight of Schultz, knowing he would never report them for fear of being punished or sent to fight at the Russian front for allowing such activity on his watch. He would often exit the scene with his catch phrase &quot;I know (see, hear) nothing!&quot; Banner was born to Jewish parents and was in fact a sergeant during World War II, but in the U.S. Army.
* Robert Clary as French Corporal Louis LeBeau, a gourmet chef, and patriotic Frenchman, frequently referred to as &quot;the cockroach&quot; by both Klink and Schultz. Clary was Jewish in real life and was deported to a Nazi concentration camp, but survived by using his talent in singing and dancing in shows. Clary said in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Singing, entertaining, and being in kind of good health at my age, that&#x27;s why I survived. I was very immature and young and not really fully realizing what situation I was involved with ... I don&#x27;t know if I would have survived if I really knew that.&quot;
* Richard Dawson as British Royal Air Force (RAF) Corporal Peter Newkirk, the group&#x27;s con man, magician, pickpocket, card sharp, forger, bookie, tailor, lock picker, and safe cracker. He is a skilled tailor and is in charge of making uniforms for POWs impersonating German soldiers. Dawson&#x27;s role as a military member in the film &quot;King Rat&quot; was reportedly the reason he landed a spot on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.
* Ivan Dixon as U.S. Staff Sergeant Ivan Kinchloe (seasons 1–5), the man responsible for contacting the underground by radio. Casting Dixon, or any African-American actor, as a positively shown supporting character was a major step for a television show in the mid-1960s. Dixon left the show prior to the final season and was replaced by Kenneth Washington as Sgt. Richard Baker, another African-American character but with a less prominent role.

* Larry Hovis as U.S. Technical Sergeant Andrew J. Carter, a bombardier who is an expert in chemistry, explosives, and demolitions. He makes explosive devices as needed. Hovis appeared in the pilot episode as a different character, but became a regular cast member when the show was picked up. 
* Kenneth Washington as U.S. Sergeant Richard Baker (season 6). He assumed the duties of Sergeant Kinchloe after Ivan Dixon left the series. Upon the death of Robert Clary on November 16, 2022, Washington became the last surviving cast member of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

==Production==
===Locations===
&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was filmed in two locations. Indoor sets were housed at Desilu Studios, later renamed as Paramount Studios for Season Four and then Cinema General Studios for Seasons Five and Six. Outdoor scenes were filmed on the 40 Acres backlot. 40 Acres was in Culver City, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Filmed in warm Southern California, the series was set in Germany during the winter and the actors had to wear warm clothes and frequently pretended to be cold;
there was always snow on the ground and rooftops and frost on the windows. The illusion of snow during the first several seasons was made using salt. By the fourth season, the set designers found a more permanent solution and lower cost, using white paint to give the illusion of snow.

After the series ended in 1971, the Stalag 13 set remained standing until 1974 when it was destroyed while filming the final scenes of &quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS&quot; (1975).

=== Theme music ===
The theme music was composed by Jerry Fielding, who added lyrics to the theme for &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes Sing The Best of World War II&quot; – an album featuring Dixon, Clary, Dawson, and Hovis singing World War II songs. The song also appeared on the album &quot;Bob Crane, His Drums and Orchestra, Play the Funny Side of TV&quot;. Bob Crane, who had started out as a drummer, played the drums when the theme was recorded for the show. The opening drum riff played by Crane in the main title sequence of the show is the same as the riff used in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962).

=== Casting ===

The actors who played the four major German roles—Werner Klemperer (Klink), John Banner (Schultz), Leon Askin (General Burkhalter), and Howard Caine (Major Hochstetter)—were all Jewish. In fact, Klemperer, Banner, and Askin had all fled the Nazis before or during World War II (Caine, whose birth name was Cohen, was an American); Klemperer, the son of conductor Otto Klemperer, fled Hitler&#x27;s Germany with his family in 1933, Banner emigrated from Switzerland to the United States when Germany annexed his native Austria in 1938, and Askin emigrated from a pre-war French internment camp in 1940 and his parents were initially transported to Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, and killed at Lublin.

Robert Clary, a French Jew who played LeBeau, spent three years in a concentration camp (with an identity tattoo from the camp on his arm, &quot;A-5714&quot;); his parents and other family members were killed there. Other Jewish actors, including Harold Gould and Harold J. Stone, made multiple appearances playing German generals. Also, the Jewish actress Louise Troy appeared in several episodes.

===Laugh track===

Network research indicated that the inclusion of a laugh track was considered essential for categorizing a single-camera show as a comedy. This hypothesis was tested on the pilot episode, &quot;The Informer&quot;, presenting two versions to test audiences: one with a laugh track and one without. The version without the laugh track, due in part to the show&#x27;s more cerebral humor, performed poorly, while the version with the laugh track garnered a more favorable reception. Consequently, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was broadcast with the laugh track, and CBS subsequently incorporated laugh tracks into all of its comedic programming.

=== German release: &quot;Ein Käfig voller Helden&quot; ===
Despite its international success as a parody of the Nazis, the series was unknown on German television for decades.

German film distributor KirchGruppe acquired broadcasting rights to the show but initially did not air it out of fear that it would offend viewers; in 1992, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was finally aired on German television for the first time, but the program failed to connect with viewers due to issues with lip syncing. However, after the dialogue was rewritten to make the characters look even more foolish (ensuring that viewers understood the characters were caricatures) the show became more successful.

First aired with a title that translates roughly as &#x27;Barbed Wire and Heels&#x27;, it was soon renamed, somewhat more whimsically in German, to &quot;Ein Käfig voller Helden&quot; (&quot;A Cage Full of Heroes&quot;), to make it more relatable to the German viewer. Klink and Schultz&#x27;s characters were given broad Saxon and Bavarian dialects, playing on regional stereotypes to underline the notion that they are comic figures. An unseen original character – &quot;Frau Kalinke&quot; – was introduced in dialogue only as Klink&#x27;s cleaning lady and perennial mistress whom he described as performing most of her cleaning duties in the nude.

==Legal issues==
Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski, the writers of the 1951 play &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, a World War II prisoner-of-war story turned into a 1953 comedy/drama feature film by Paramount Pictures, sued Bing Crosby Productions, the show’s producer, for infringement. Their lawsuit was unsuccessful; although the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, a federal judge overruled them. The judge found &quot;striking difference in the dramatic mood of the two works.&quot;

In 2012, an arbitration hearing was scheduled to determine whether Bernard Fein and Albert S. Ruddy, the creators of the show, had transferred the right to make a movie of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; to Bing Crosby Productions along with the television rights or had retained the derivative movie rights. In 2013, Fein (through his estate) and Ruddy acquired the sequel and other separate rights to &quot;Hogan’s Heroes&quot; from Mark Cuban via arbitration, and a movie based on the show was planned.

==Reception==
&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; won two Emmy Awards out of twelve nominations. Both wins were for Werner Klemperer as Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Comedy, in 1968 and 1969. Klemperer received nominations in the same category in 1966, 1967 and 1970. The series&#x27; other nominations were for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1966, 1967 and 1968; Bob Crane for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series in 1966 and 1967; Nita Talbot for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Comedy in 1968; and Gordon Avil for cinematography in 1968.

The producers of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; were honored in the first annual NAACP Image Awards, presented in August 1967, one of seven television shows and two news shows that were recognized for &quot;the furtherance of the Negro image.&quot; Other honorees included &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Daktari&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In December 2005, the series was listed at number 100 as part of the &quot;Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History&quot; by TV Guide and TV Land. The show was described as an &quot;unlikely POW camp comedy.&quot;

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment (under CBS DVD starting in 2006) has released all six seasons of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; on DVD in regions 1 and 4. The series was previously released by Columbia House as individual discs, each with five or six consecutive episodes, as well as on a compilation 42 VHS collection of the 168 episodes.

On March 8, 2016, CBS Home Entertainment re-released a repackaged version of the complete series set, at a lower price.

In Australia (Region 4), the first DVD releases were from Time–Life (from around 2002–2005) with each disc sold individually with 4–5 episodes per disc. Between 2005 and 2007 these same discs were packaged as individual complete-season collections.

The complete series was released on Blu-ray in Germany in 2018. The set consists of 23 double-layer BD-50 discs. The discs are region-free. While menus and titles are in German, the episodes include both German and original English audio tracks.
On December 13, 2022, Paramount Pictures released the entire blu-ray series in the U.S.

==Merchandise and promotion==
In 1965, Fleer produced a 66-trading card set based on the series. Dell Comics produced nine issues of a series based on the show from 1966 to 1969, all with photo covers. The artwork was provided by Henry Scarpelli. &quot;Mad&quot; magazine #108 (January 1967) parodied the show as &quot;Hokum&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. An additional one-page parody called &quot;Hochman&#x27;s Heroes&quot; took the show&#x27;s premise to the next level by setting it in Buchenwald concentration camp.

In 1968, Clary, Dawson, Dixon, and Hovis recorded an album titled &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes Sing the Best of World War II&quot;, which included lyrics for the theme song. While the show was in production, Crane, Klemperer, Askin, and Banner all appeared (as different characters) in the 1968 film &quot;The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz&quot;.

<text>A brickfilm is a film or Internet video made by either shooting stop motion animation using construction set bricks like Lego bricks (and figures) or using computer-generated imagery or traditional animation to imitate the look. They can sometimes also be live action films featuring plastic construction toys (or representations of them). Since the 2000s The Lego Group has released various films and TV series and brickfilms have also become popular on (social-) media websites. The term “brick film” was coined by Jason Rowoldt, founder of the website brickfilms.com.

==History==
===1960s–1970s: Early brickfilms===
The earliest known brickfilm was a German advertisement for Lego, released around 1960. It features various brick-built animal characters, including dogs, cats, and camels, all animated using stop-motion. Little information is known about the advertisement, other than it was released for German cinemas. A display featuring the advertisement is located in the History Collection of Lego House, in Billund, Denmark.

The first known amateur brickfilm, , was created in 1973 by Lars C. Hassing and Henrik Hassing. The six-minute video featured both stop motion animation and live action, and was filmed on Super 8 film. It depicted Apollo 17 and was made for their grandparents&#x27; golden wedding anniversary. The film was later shown to Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, who had a personal copy made, though the film was not released to the public until May 2013, when the creator uploaded it to YouTube.

Other early brickfilms are known to have been created from 1975 onwards. Many were independent projects while others were promos or advertisements made by Lego itself.

===1980s–1990s===
A well-known early brickfilm was made between 1985 and 1989 in Perth, Western Australia by Lindsay Fleay, named &quot;The Magic Portal&quot;. It was filmed on a Bolex 16mm camera with 16mm film and features animated Lego, Plasticine, and cardboard characters and objects, mixing both stop motion animation and live action footage, with Fleay making a live action appearance. &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; had high production values for a brickfilm of its time, with a five-figure budget granted by the Australian Film Commission. However, due to legal issues with The Lego Group, it did not see a wide release for years. The Lego Group eventually backed down on these charges.

More early brickfilms were produced in the &quot;Lego Sport Champions&quot; series, officially commissioned by The Lego Group in 1987. During this time, Dave Lennie and Andrew Boyer started making &quot;Legomation&quot; using a VHS camera and professional video equipment.

An early brickfilm with no involvement from The Lego Group to be widely released was a music video for the UK dance act Ethereal for their song &quot;Zap&quot; on Truelove Records. Released in 1991, the film was shown across the MTV network and other music channels and was the first time a full-length stop-motion brickfilm has been released across public channels. The film again attracted the attention of The Lego Group&#x27;s legal department. The film was directed by filmmaker David Betteridge with animation direction handled by Phil Burgess and Art Direction by Daniel Betteridge. The story was an interpretation of scenes from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; adapted to the rave culture of the late eighties, following three heroic Lego men as they battle and overcome evil. The film&#x27;s budget was £3,000 GBP, enabling the filmmakers to shoot on 35mm film using a hand-cranked camera built in 1903 and modified with an animation motor. Originally scheduled to take two weekends, the film&#x27;s production took three and a half months to complete.

In the late 1990s, the age of film and video brickfilms ended as digital cameras became more and more accessible. Also, the internet allowed brickfilmers to produce and distribute their work more easily.

===2000s–present===
Throughout the 2000s, brickfilms increased in sophistication and garnered some media attention. Higher-end films would often feature digital effects, created frame-by-frame with image editors or inserted via video compositing software. In 2000, the brickfilm &quot;Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World&quot; was accepted to over 80 film festivals, including Sundance.

The Lego Group officially encouraged the creation of brickfilms with the release of Lego Studios in 2000. Since then, The Lego Group has used various brickfilms and TV series to help advertise new themes and sets. The founding of Brickfilms.com in 2000 provided a centralized location for brickfilmers to share their work online. The site did not directly host its members&#x27; films, but rather allowed members to link to webpages where they could be downloaded or streamed from. These actions both significantly increased brickfilming&#x27;s popularity through the mid-2000s.

The Deluxe Edition DVD of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; contained an extra in the form of a brickfilm of the &quot;Camelot Song&quot;, produced by Spite Your Face Productions. Throughout the early 2000s, Spite Your Face Productions created several viral brickfilms in collaboration with The Lego Group, including &quot;The Han Solo Affair&quot; and &quot;The Peril of Doc Ock&quot;.

In 2005, Lego released the official computer-generated brickfilm &quot;Lego Star Wars: Revenge of the Brick&quot; to tie in with the release of &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. It premiered on Cartoon Network and was later included on the second DVD volume of &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot; TV series.

In the mid-2000s, brickfilms became more widespread upon the rise of YouTube. In 2007, Lego hosted the Lego Star Wars Movie Making Contest, further publicizing brickfilms online.

In 2010, The Lego Group produced and released Lego&#x27;s first official feature-length film, &quot;&quot;. Since then, Lego has produced four more brickfilm-like feature films, &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; (2014), &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017), &quot;The Lego Ninjago Movie&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot; (2019). The Lego Group also produced multiple animated series for multiple franchises like &quot;Ninjago&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; (e.g. &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures&quot; (2016–17), &quot;Friends&quot; or &quot;Legends of Chima&quot; (2013–14). While these are created using primarily computer generated animation, they are styled in such a way as to emulate the look of stop-motion brickfilms, even being influenced by some popular brickfilms such as &quot;The Magic Portal&quot;. Lego additionally also releases video games (e.g. &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; (2007)) featuring Lego bricks and minifigures.

In 2024, Lego and Universal Pictures released a brickfilm-style take on the theatrical trailer for the first of the two-part film adaptation of &quot;Wicked&quot;.

Also in 2024, Focus Features released &quot;Piece by Piece,&quot; a story about Pharrell Williams&#x27; life, directed by Morgan Neville and made in the brickfilm style using Lego animation. 

For years, almost all brickfilming was created using digital cameras and webcams. However, since the advent of stop-motion apps on mobile devices, brickfilming is accessible to many more people. After the release of &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, The Lego Group produced a stop-motion animation themed construction set which was compatible with smartphones and encouraged the art of brickfilming (853650).

==Technique==
Modern brickfilms are captured with digital still cameras (sometimes in the form of webcams, DSLRs or camcorders with still image capability). The most widely used framerates for brickfilms are 12, 15, or 24 frames per second. Animators also tend to use a standard 4-frame minifigure walk cycle.

To capture images for the animation, most brickfilmers prefer to use dedicated stop motion software, such as the free Stop Motion Studio, Boats Animator, and Eagle Animation, or professional software such as Dragonframe. Afterwards, compositing software such as Adobe After Effects can be used to add visual effects and a video editor can be used to compile the frames with audio tracks and complete the production of the film.

== Franchises ==
The Lego Group produced various short films, feature films and video games featuring Lego minifigures and bricks. Most of these are based on other already existing franchises like &quot;Star Wars&quot; or DC Comics. These films are created using primarily computer generated animation, they are styled in such a way as to emulate the look of stop-motion brickfilms.

Multiple video games also feature Lego minifigures and bricks are inspired by brickfilms.

==Brickfilming communities and festivals==

===Communities===
Brickfilms.com by Brick à Brack is an online community dedicated to brickfilming. Founded December 16, 2000 by Jason Rowoldt, Brickfilms.com was the first internet brickfilming community ever created. The website hosts a brickfilm directory, threads for filmmakers, technical articles, resources and organizes many brickfilm contests. In 2007 the site was the Internet&#x27;s &quot;main hub for Lego filmmaking&quot;, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

Bricks in Motion is an online community focused on the art of brickfilming. It was originally founded in 2001 as the personal website of pioneering brickfilmer Thomas Foote, and the current incarnation was founded by Jonathan Schlaepfer in 2008 as a new community-focused brickfilming website, featuring a forum and later a film directory. Starting in 2008, it became the main home of the English-speaking brickfilming community at the time, following an exodus from Brickfilms.com. The current administrators are Chris Wynn and Sean Willis. It is one of the largest and most active online communities. Bricks in Motion annually hosts the two largest community-run brickfilming contests, the Twenty-Four-Hour-Animation Contest (abbreviated to THAC) and the Brickfilm Rapidly All Week Long contest (abbreviated to BRAWL).

Brickfilm Day is an online community known for its annual Brickfilm Day event, in which participants submit a brickfilm or a video about brickfilming, all to be released on one day. The first Brickfilm Day festival was in 2018, celebrating the 45th anniversary of &quot;En rejse til månen&quot; (Danish for &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;). They have organized several brickfilm community projects, such as recreations of popular movie trailers and scenes. Brickfilm Day does not have a dedicated website, but does have a community on Discord.

===Film festivals===
There are multiple film festivals in the brickfilming community that are dedicated entirely to the screening of brickfilms, usually as part of a wider Lego convention. A few notable festivals are the Brickworld Film Festival, based in Chicago, Cine Brick, a Portugal-based brickfilming festival, and Steinerei, a German brickfilming festival.

==Documentary==
In 2014, The owner of the Bricks In Motion website, Philip Heinrich, and his production company, Ergo Possum, started a Kickstarter campaign to crowdsource the funding of a feature-length movie, &quot;Bricks in Motion&quot;, a documentary that follows brickfilmers from around the world and showcases their diverse personalities and their love for the craft. It reached a total of $12,800 and started production in 2014. Production was completed in December 2015, and the film was released on various streaming services in 2017.

<doc id="146562" wikidata="Q1334617" url="?curid=146562" title="Raymond Scott">
<text>Raymond Scott (born Harry Warnow; September 10, 1908 – February 8, 1994) was an American composer, band leader, pianist, record producer, and inventor of electronic instruments.

Known best in his time as a composer of production music, Scott is today regarded as an early pioneer of electronica. Though Scott never scored cartoon soundtracks, his music is familiar to millions because Carl Stalling adapted it in over 120 Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and other Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons. His compositions may also be heard in &quot;The Ren and Stimpy Show&quot; (which uses Scott&#x27;s recordings in twelve episodes), &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Duckman&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;The Oblongs&quot;, &quot;Batfink&quot;, &quot;Puppetoons&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and &quot;Bluey&quot;. The only time he composed to accompany animation was three 20-second commercial jingles for County Fair Bread in 1962.

==Early life and career==
Scott was born in Brooklyn, New York to Russian Jewish immigrants, Joseph and Sarah Warnow. His older brother, Mark Warnow, was a conductor, violinist, and musical director for the CBS radio program &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; and encouraged his musical career.

A 1931 graduate of the Juilliard School of Music, where he studied piano, theory and composition, Scott, under his birth name, began his professional career as a pianist for the CBS Radio house band. His brother, Mark, older by eight years, conducted the orchestra. He adopted the pseudonym &quot;Raymond Scott&quot; to spare his brother charges of nepotism when the orchestra began performing the pianist&#x27;s idiosyncratic compositions. In 1935, he married Pearl Zimney.

In late 1936, Scott assembled a band from among his CBS colleagues, calling it the Raymond Scott Quintette. It was a six-piece group, but he thought &quot;Quintette&quot; (his spelling) sounded &quot;crisper&quot;; he also told a reporter that he feared &quot;calling it a &#x27;sextet&#x27; might get your mind off music.&quot; His sidemen were Pete Pumiglio (clarinet); Bunny Berigan (trumpet, replaced by Dave Wade); Louis Shoobe (double bass); Dave Harris (tenor saxophone); and Johnny Williams (drums). They made their first recordings in New York on February 20, 1937, for Master Records, owned by music publisher/impresario Irving Mills (Duke Ellington&#x27;s manager).

The Quintette represented Scott&#x27;s attempt to revitalize swing music through tight, busy arrangements that reduced reliance on improvisation. He called this style &quot;descriptive jazz&quot; and gave his works unusual titles like &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve in a Haunted House&quot;, &quot;Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals&quot; (recorded by the Kronos Quartet in 1993), and &quot;Bumpy Weather Over Newark&quot;. Although his songs were popular with the public, jazz critics disdained them as novelty music. Besides being a prominent figure in recording studios and on radio and concert stages, Scott wrote and was interviewed in &quot;DownBeat&quot;, &quot;Metronome&quot;, and &quot;Billboard&quot;.

Scott believed in composing and playing by ear. He composed not on paper but &quot;on his band&quot;—by humming phrases to his sidemen or by demonstrating riffs and rhythms on the keyboard and instructing players to interpret his cues. It was all done by ear with no written scores, a process known as head arrangements. Scott, who was also a savvy sound engineer, recorded the band&#x27;s rehearsals on discs and used the recordings as references to develop his compositions. He reworked, re-sequenced, and deleted passages, and added themes from other discs to construct finished works. During the developmental process, he let his players improvise, but once complete, he regarded a piece as relatively fixed and permitted little further improvisation. Scott controlled the band&#x27;s repertoire and style, but he rarely took piano solos, preferring to direct the band from the keyboard and leave solos and leads to his sidemen. He also had a penchant for adapting classical motifs in his compositions.

The Quintette existed from 1937 to 1939 and recorded bestselling discs such as &quot;Twilight in Turkey&quot;, &quot;Minuet in Jazz&quot;, &quot;War Dance for Wooden Indians&quot;, &quot;Reckless Night on Board an Ocean Liner&quot;, &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, and &quot;The Penguin&quot;. One of Scott&#x27;s popular compositions is &quot;The Toy Trumpet&quot;, a cheerful pop confection that is instantly recognizable to many people who cannot name the title or composer. In the 1938 film &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, Shirley Temple sings a version of the song. Trumpeter Al Hirt&#x27;s 1964 rendition with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops performed a version. &quot;In an Eighteenth-Century Drawing Room&quot; is a pop adaptation of the opening theme from Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata in C, K. 545.


In 1939, Scott turned his Quintette into a big band. When he was named music director by CBS radio three years later, he organized the first racially integrated radio band. Over the next two years, he hired saxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Charlie Shavers, bassist Billy Taylor, trumpeter Emmett Berry, trombonist Benny Morton, and drummer Cozy Cole. In 1942, Scott relinquished his keyboard duties so he could concentrate on hiring, composing, arranging, and conducting. He returned to the keyboard with some of his bands.

In 1941, he led a 13-piece orchestra to produce what he termed &quot;silent music&quot; in New York, making a great show of performing with very little sound. This was one of the earliest performances of the silent or near-silent music canon.

==Middle career==
After serving as music director for programs &quot;Broadway Bandbox&quot; from 1942 to 1944, Scott left the network. He composed and arranged music (with lyrics by Bernie Hanighen) for the 1946 Broadway musical &quot;Lute Song&quot; starring Mary Martin and Yul Brynner.

In the late 1940s, contemporaneous with guitarist Les Paul&#x27;s studio work with Mary Ford, Scott began recording pop songs using the layered multi-tracked vocals of his second wife, singer Dorothy Collins. A number of these were commercially released, but the technique failed to earn him the chart success of Les Paul and Mary Ford.

In 1948, Scott formed a six-man &quot;quintet&quot; which served for several months as house band for the CBS radio program &quot;Herb Shriner Time&quot;. The group made studio recordings, some of which were released on Scott&#x27;s short-lived Master Records label. This was not the Irving Mills-owned label of the same name; Scott allegedly named his label in tribute to the defunct Mills enterprise.

When his brother Mark Warnow died in 1949, Scott succeeded him as orchestra leader on the CBS Radio show &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; . During the following year, the show moved to NBC Television, and Scott continued to lead the orchestra until 1957. Collins was a featured singer on &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. The high-profile position paid well, but Scott considered it strictly a &quot;rent gig&quot; and used his salary to finance his electronic music research out of the limelight.

In 1950, Scott composed his first—and only known—classical work, entitled &quot;Suite for Violin and Piano&quot;. The five-movement suite was performed at Carnegie Hall on February 7, 1950, by violinist Arnold Eidus and pianist Carlo Bussotti, who recorded the work.)

In 1958, while serving as an A&amp;R director for Everest, Scott produced singer Gloria Lynne&#x27;s album &quot;Miss Gloria Lynne&quot;. The sidemen included many of the same session players (e.g., Milt Hinton, Sam Taylor, George Duvivier, Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, Eddie Costa, Kenny Burrell, Wild Bill Davis) who participated in Scott&#x27;s 1959 Secret 7 recording project.

==Electronics and research==
Scott, who attended Brooklyn Technical High School, was an electronic music pioneer and adventurous sound engineer. During the 1930s and 1940s, many of his band&#x27;s recording sessions found the bandleader in the control room, monitoring and adjusting the acoustics, often by revolutionary means. As Gert-Jan Blom and Jeff Winner wrote, &quot;Scott sought to master all aspects of sound capture and manipulation. His special interest in the technical aspects of recording, combined with the state-of-the-art facilities at his disposal, provided him with enormous hands-on experience as an engineer.&quot;

In 1946, he established Manhattan Research Incorporated. As well as designing electronic audio devices for personal use, over the years Scott sold and supported a number of related projects, including components such as ring modulators, wave, tone, and envelope shapers, modulators, and filters. Of interest were the &quot;keyboard theremin&quot;, &quot;chromatic electronic drum generators&quot;, and &quot;circle generators&quot;. Scott described Manhattan Research as &quot;More than a think factory—a dream center where the excitement of tomorrow is made available today.&quot; Bob Moog, developer of the Moog Synthesizer, met Scott in the 1950s, designed circuits for him in the 1960s, and considered him an important influence.

Relying on several instruments of his own invention, such as the Clavivox and Electronium, Scott recorded futuristic electronic compositions for use in television and radio commercials and records of electronic music. A series of three albums designed to lull infants to sleep, his work &quot;Soothing Sounds for Baby&quot; was released in 1964 with the Gesell Institute of Child Development. The public showed little interest in it. But Manhattan Research provided ear-catching sonic textures for commercials.

Scott developed some of the first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He credited himself as the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer. His electromechanical devices, some with motors moving photocells past lights, bore little resemblance to the all-electronic sequencers of the late Sixties. He began working on a machine he said could compose by artificial intelligence. The Electronium, as Scott called it, with its array of knobs, buttons, and patch panels is considered the first self-composing synthesizer.

Some of Raymond Scott&#x27;s projects were less complex but still ambitious. During the 1950s and 1960s, he developed and patented electronic telephone ringers, alarms, chimes, and sirens, vending machines, and ashtrays with accompanying electronic music scores, an electronic musical baby rattle, and an adult toy that produced varying sounds depending on how two people touched each another. He believed these devices would &quot;electronically update the many sounds around us – the functional sounds.&quot;

While these devices foreshadowed the future of electronic music, they were not commercially successful. As Mark Brend wrote at Reverb.com: 
Hindsight reveals Scott as more ideas-man than business-man. Glossy brochures advertised a dizzying array of his inventions: electronic doorbells, multitrack tape recorders, rhythm machines, sequencers, and instruments such as the Clavivox, a kind of keyboard theremin. But these rarely sold. It&#x27;s possible that didn&#x27;t bother Scott too much, as through the &#x27;50s he was still earning well from the first phase of his career and had a new income stream composing electronic jingles—for Sprite, Nescafé, and Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, among others.

Scott and Dorothy Collins divorced in 1964, and in 1967 he married Mitzi Curtis (1918–2012). During the second half of the 1960s, he became isolated and secretive about his inventions; he gave few interviews, made no public presentations, and released no records. In 1966–67, Scott (under the screen credit &quot;Ramond Scott&quot;) composed and recorded electronic music soundtracks for experimental films by Muppets creator Jim Henson.

During his big band period, Scott endured tense relationships with musicians he employed. But when his career became immersed in electronic gadgetry, he preferred the company of technicians, such as Bob Moog, Herb Deutsch, Thomas Rhea, and Alan Entenmann. Scott welcomed curious visitors to his lab, among them French electronic music pioneer Jean-Jacques Perrey in March 1960.

==Motown years==

In 1969, Berry Gordy of Motown visited Scott at his Long Island labs to witness the Electronium in action. Impressed by the possibilities, Gordy hired Scott in 1971 as director of Motown&#x27;s electronic music and research department in Los Angeles, a position Scott held until 1977. No Motown recordings using Scott&#x27;s electronic inventions have yet been publicly identified. Guy Costa, Head of Operations and Chief Engineer at Motown from 1969 to 1987, said about Scott&#x27;s hiring:
:He started originally working [on the Electronium] out of Berry&#x27;s house. They set up a room over the garages, and he worked there putting stuff together so Berry could get involved and see the progress. At one point Scott worked out of a studio. The unit never really got finalized—Ray had a real problem letting go. It was always being developed. That was a problem for Berry. He wanted instant gratification. Eventually his interest started to wane after a period of probably two or three years. Finally Ray took the thing down to his house and kept working on it. Berry kind of lost interest. He was off doing Diana Ross movies.

Scott later said he &quot;spent 11 years and close to a million dollars developing the Electronium.&quot; After leaving Motown he was mostly unemployed, though hardly inactive. He continued to modify his inventions, adapting computers and primitive MIDI devices to his systems. He suffered a series of heart attacks, ran low on cash, and became a subject on &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot;

Largely forgotten by the public by the 1980s, he suffered a stroke in 1987 that left him unable to work or engage in conversation. His recordings were largely out of print, his electronic instruments were cobweb-collecting relics, and his royalty stream had slowed to a trickle.

==Secret Seven==
In 1959, Scott organized a band of top-tier jazz session musicians and recorded an album entitled &quot;The Unexpected&quot;, credited to the Secret Seven, and released on the Top Rank label. Musicians performing on the album included Sam “The Man” Taylor, Harry “Sweets” Edison, Wild Bill Davis, Milt Hinton, Elvin Jones, Toots Thielemans, and Kenny Burrell, as well as Scott&#x27;s then-wife Dorthy Collins.

==The cartoon connection==
In 1943, Scott sold his music publishing to Warner Bros., who allowed Carl Stalling, music director for &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, to adapt anything in the Warner music catalog.

Stalling began peppering his cartoon scores with Scott quotes, such as in &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot;. Scott&#x27;s tunes have been licensed to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Ren and Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;The Oblongs&quot;, &quot;Batfink&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;Duckman&quot;. &quot;Powerhouse&quot; was quoted ten times in the Warner Brothers feature &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003).

==Obscurity and rediscovery==
Interest in Scott&#x27;s work was revived in the early 1990s, after Irwin Chusid met Raymond and his wife Mitzi at their home in California and discovered a collection of unreleased recordings of rehearsals and studio sessions. In 1992, the release of &quot;Reckless Nights and Turkish Twilights&quot; by Columbia, produced by Irwin Chusid with Hal Willner as executive producer, was the first major-label compilation by his 1937–39 six-man quintet. A year earlier, Chusid and Will Friedwald produced an album of quintet broadcasts titled &quot;The Man Who Made Cartoons Swing&quot; for Stash. The director of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, John Kricfalusi, began using quintet recordings. In the late-1990s, The Beau Hunks, a Dutch ensemble that performed music written by Leroy Shield for Laurel and Hardy movies, released two albums of by Scott&#x27;s sextet: &quot;Celebration on the Planet Mars&quot; and &quot;Manhattan Minuet&quot; (both released by Basta Audio-Visuals). Members of The Beau Hunks (reconfigured as a &quot;Saxtet&quot;, then a &quot;Soctette&quot;) performed and recorded Scott works, sometimes in collaboration with the Metropole Orchestra.

The posthumously released &quot;Manhattan Research Inc.&quot; (Basta, 2000, co-produced by Gert-Jan Blom and Jeff Winner) showcases Scott&#x27;s pioneering electronic works from the 1950s and 1960s on two CDs (the package includes a 144-page hardcover book). &quot;Microphone Music&quot; (Basta, 2002, produced by Irwin Chusid with Blom and Winner as project advisors), explores the original Scott Quintette&#x27;s work. The 2008 CD release &quot;Ectoplasm&quot; (Basta) chronicles a second (1948–49) incarnation of the six-man &quot;quintet&quot; format, with Scott&#x27;s wife Dorothy Collins singing on several tracks. In June 2017, Basta issued a 3-LP/2-CD set entitled &quot;Three Willow Park: Electronic Music from Inner Space&quot;, featuring 61 unreleased electronic recordings made by Scott between 1961 and 1971 (Basta, 2017, produced by Gert-Jan Blom, Irwin Chusid, and Jeff Winner). AllMusic named the set one of the &quot;Best Compilations of 2017&quot;.

Devo founding member Mark Mothersbaugh, through his company Mutato Muzika, purchased Scott&#x27;s only (non-functioning) Electronium in 1996 with the intention of restoring it.

J Dilla sampled &quot;Lightworks&quot; and &quot;Bendix 1: The Tomorrow People&quot; for the track &quot;Lightworks&quot; and &quot;Sprite: Melonball Bounce&quot; for the track &quot;Workinonit&quot; on his final album &quot;Donuts&quot;.

In 2023, Scott received a posthumous Grammy Award nomination in the Best Instrumental Composition category for &quot;Cutey and the Dragon.&quot; The work was begun on paper by Scott in 1982 and completed in 2022 by Gordon Goodwin (who also received a nomination as co-composer). Its debut recording appears on the 2023 album &quot;Raymond Scott Reimagined&quot; by Quartet San Francisco, Gordon Goodwin&#x27;s Big Phat Band, and Take 6.

==Death==
On February 8, 1994, Scott died of pneumonia in North Hills, Los Angeles, California.

==Films and television==
In addition to Warner Brothers cartoons (which were intended for theatrical screening), the following films include recordings or works composed or co-composed by Scott: &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1937, various adapted standards); &quot;Ali Baba Goes to Town&quot; (1938, &quot;Twilight in Turkey&quot; and &quot;Arabania&quot;); &quot;Happy Landing&quot; (1938, &quot;War Dance for Wooden Indians&quot;); &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; (1938, &quot;The Toy Trumpet&quot;; with special lyrics by Jack Lawrence); &quot;Just Around the Corner&quot; (1938, &quot;Brass Buttons and Epaulettes&quot; [performed by Scott&#x27;s Quintette, but not composed by Scott]); &quot;Sally, Irene and Mary&quot; (1938, &quot;Minuet in Jazz&quot;); &quot;Bells of Rosarita&quot; (1945, &quot;Singing Down the Road&quot;); &quot;Not Wanted&quot; (1949, theme and orchestrations); &quot;The West Point Story&quot; (1950, &quot;The Toy Trumpet&quot;); &quot;Storm Warning&quot; (1951, &quot;Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals&quot;); &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955, &quot;Flagging the Train to Tuscaloosa&quot;; words by Mack David); &quot;Never Love a Stranger&quot; (1958, score); &quot;The Pusher&quot; (1960, score); &quot;Clean and Sober&quot; (1988, &quot;Singing Down the Road&quot;); &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989, &quot;Powerhouse&quot; [uncredited, affirmed in out-of-court settlement]); &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; (1995, &quot;Moment Whimsical&quot;); &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995, &quot;The Penguin&quot;); &quot;Lulu on the Bridge&quot; (1998, &quot;Devil Drums&quot;); &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003, &quot;Powerhouse&quot;); &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; (2005, &quot;Dinner Music for Pack of Hungry Cannibals&quot;); &quot;RocknRolla&quot; (2008, &quot;Powerhouse&quot;); &quot;Best of Enemies&quot; (2015, &quot;Portofino&quot;); &quot;The Space Between Us&quot; (2017, &quot;Song of India&quot;); and &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor&quot; (2018, &quot;Waltz of the Diddles&quot;).

In April 2021, Scott&#x27;s &quot;Powerhouse&quot; was used in the CBS TV show &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, in the opening scene of the episode &quot;Mitch&#x27;s Son and the Unconditional Approval of a Government Agency&quot; (season 4, ep. 14).

Scott&#x27;s son, film editor Stan Warnow, released the documentary &quot;Deconstructing Dad: The Music, Machines and Mystery of Raymond Scott&quot; in 2010.

<text>Wizards of the Coast LLC (WotC or Wizards) is an American game publisher, most of which are based on fantasy and science-fiction themes, and formerly an operator of retail game stores. In 1999, toy manufacturer Hasbro acquired the company and currently operates it as a subsidiary. During a February 2021 reorganization of Hasbro, WotC became the lead part of a new division called &quot;Wizards &amp; Digital&quot;.

WotC was originally a role-playing game (RPG) publisher that in the mid-1990s originated and popularized collectible card games with &quot;&quot;. It later acquired TSR, publisher of the RPG &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and published the licensed &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; from 1999 to 2003. WotC&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located in Renton, Washington, which is part of the Seattle metropolitan area.

The company publishes RPGs, board games, and collectible card games. It has received numerous awards, including several Origins Awards. The company has also produced sets of sports cards and series for association football, baseball, basketball and American football.

== History ==

Wizards of the Coast (WotC) was founded by Peter Adkison in 1990 outside of Seattle, Washington, and its current headquarters is located in nearby Renton. The company was named after a guild of wizards in a role-playing game (RPG) Adkison was playing. The company published RPGs such as the third edition of &quot;Talislanta&quot; and its own product &quot;The Primal Order&quot; (1992). &quot;The Primal Order&quot; was a supplement designed for use with any game system, but Palladium Books sued WotC for using references to Palladium&#x27;s game and system. The suit was settled in 1993.

In 1991, Richard Garfield approached WotC with the idea for a new board game called &quot;RoboRally&quot; but Adkison rejected it because the game would have been too expensive to produce. Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was portable and quick-playing, and Garfield agreed.

Adkison set up a new corporation called Garfield Games to develop Garfield&#x27;s collectible card game concept into &quot;&quot;. The new company sheltered the game from the legal battle with Palladium. Garfield Games then licensed the production and sale rights to WotC until the court case was settled, at which point Garfield Games was shut down. WotC debuted &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; in July 1993 at Origins Game Fair in Dallas. The following month, the game was extremely popular at Gen Con, selling out of its supply of 2.5 million cards, which had been planned to last until the end of the year. The game&#x27;s success generated revenue that grew the company in two years from a few employees working in Adkison&#x27;s basement headquarters to 250 employees in its own offices. In 1994, &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; won the Mensa Top Five Mind Games award, and the Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game of 1993 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game of 1993.

In 1994, WotC began an association with The Beanstalk Group, a brand-licensing agency and consultancy, to license the brand &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. After the success of &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;, in 1994, WotC published &quot;RoboRally&quot;, which won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. Also in 1994, WotC also expanded its RPG line by buying &quot;SLA Industries&quot; from Nightfall Games and &quot;Ars Magica&quot; from White Wolf. In 1995, WotC published &quot;The Great Dalmuti&quot;, another card game by Richard Garfield, which won the 1995 Mensa Best New Mind Game award. In August 1995, WotC released &quot;Everway&quot; before closing its RPG product line four months later. In 1995, Wizards&#x27; annual sales passed US$65 million.

=== Acquisition of TSR and &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; ===
Wizards of the Coast announced the purchase of TSR, the makers of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, on April 10, 1997. WotC acquired TSR and Five Rings Publishing Group for $25 million. As part of the sale, TSR employees were offered an opportunity to relocate from Wisconsin to the west coast. WotC continued using the brand name TSR until 2000 and allowed the trademark to expire in 2004. Between 1997 and 1999, the company spun off several TSR campaign settings, including Planescape, Dark Sun, and Spelljammer, to focus the business on the more profitable Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms lines.

In mid 1997, WotC revisited the concept of a third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, having first discussed it soon after the purchase of TSR. WotC released the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in 2000 with the d20 System. The company released these properties under the Open Game License, which allows other companies to make use of those systems.

The new edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; won multiple Origins Awards in 2000, such as &quot;Best Roleplaying Game&quot; for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure&quot;, &quot;or Supplement&quot; for the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. In 2002, WotC sponsored a design contest for which designers could submit proposals to produce a new campaign world to the company. WotC selected &quot;Eberron&quot;, which game designer Keith Baker submitted, and its first campaign book was released in June 2004. The &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; won the 2004 Origins Award for &quot;Best Role-Playing Supplement&quot;. In 2003, WotC released version 3.5 of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and the d20 system. The 30th anniversary of the D&amp;D game was celebrated at Gen Con Indy 2004.

==== &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; ====
On August 2, 1997, Wizards of the Coast was granted on collectible card games. In January 1999, WotC began publishing &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; after acquiring the rights in August 1998. The game sold nearly 400,000 copies in less than six weeks and sold 10-times more units than initial projections. Some sports card series were discontinued in 1999 because so many printers were producing &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards. The game won the National Parenting Center&#x27;s 1999 Seal of Approval.

Within a year, WotC had sold millions of copies of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; game and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD-ROM. WotC continued to publish the game until 2003. One of Nintendo&#x27;s affiliates The Pokémon Company (formerly Pokémon USA) began producing a new edition for the game one day after the last of its agreements with Wizards expired on September 30, 2003. The following day, WotC filed suit against Nintendo, accusing it of &quot;abandoning a contract with Wizards, the longtime producer and distributor of Pokémon trading-card games, and using Wizards-patented methods and technology to manufacture the games itself&quot;. The companies resolved the legal action in December 2003 without going to court.

==== Retail stores ====
After the company&#x27;s success in 1999 with &quot;Pokémon&quot;, Wizards of the Coast acquired and expanded The Game Keeper, a US chain of retail gaming stores, eventually changing its name to Wizards of the Coast. The company&#x27;s gaming center in Seattle was closed in March 2001. In December 2003, WotC announced it would close all of its stores to allow it concentrate on game design. The stores were closed in early 2004.

=== Acquisition by Hasbro ===
In September 1999, toy manufacturer Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast for about US$325 million. Avalon Hill, which Hasbro had purchased in mid-1998, was made a division of WotC in late 1999. In November 1999, WotC announced Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention. Also in November, Vince Caluori became President of WotC.

On January 1, 2001, Peter Adkison resigned from WotC. In August 2001, the company, which had been a semi-independent division of Hasbro, was consolidated into Hasbro&#x27;s game division. According to trade magazine &quot;ICv2&quot;: &quot;this is seen as a loss of autonomy for WotC by most. The Hasbro release specified that despite the consolidation at the management level, WotC will continue to operate out of its Seattle offices.&quot; Between 2001 and 2002, Hasbro sold Origins Game Fair to Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA), and in May 2002, it sold Gen Con to Peter Adkison.

=== 2000–2010 ===

In 2000, Wizards of the Coast introduced the Open Game License (OGL), which allowed the production of a wide range of unofficial commercial derivative works based on the mechanics of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;; it is credited with increasing the market share of d20 products and leading to a &quot;boom in the RPG industry in the early 2000s&quot;. Chuck Huebner became president and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in June 2002. In 2003, the company employed 850 people.

Throughout the early 2000s, WotC won multiple Origins Awards, including: 2001 &quot;Best Role-Playing Game Supplement&quot; (&quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting)&quot; and the &quot;Best Game Related Novel&quot; (&quot;Clan War 7th Scroll: The Lion);&quot; 2002 &quot;Best Role-Playing Adventure&quot; (&quot;City of the Spider Queen&quot;); 2005 &quot;Collectible Card Game or Expansion of the Year&quot; (&quot;&quot; expansion for &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;) and &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Choice Best Historical Game of the Year&quot; (&quot;Axis and Allies Collectible Miniatures Game&quot;), and the 2006 &quot;Miniature or Miniatures Line of the Year&quot; (&quot;Colossal Red Dragon&quot;). It also won the 2002 Gold Ennie Award for &quot;Best Publisher&quot; and the 2006 Silver Ennie Award for &quot;Fan&#x27;s Choice for Best Publisher&quot;.

In 2002, Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s periodicals department was spun off; WotC outsourced its magazines by licensing &quot;Dungeon&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Polyhedron&quot;, and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; to Paizo Publishing. The license expired in September 2007 and WotC began publishing the magazines online. In 2003, WotC released &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; miniatures; collectible, painted, plastic miniature games. In 2004, the company added a licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; line. In April 2004, Loren Greenwood succeeded Huebner as the subsidiary&#x27;s president. Also in 2004, Avalon Hill became a subsidiary of WotC.

In early 2006, WotC filed a lawsuit against Daron Rutter, who was the administrator of the website MTG Salvation. The lawsuit said Rutter publicly posted confidential prototypes of upcoming &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; card sets to the MTG Salvation forums, ten months before the cards were to be released. The lawsuit was settled out of court, according to Mark Rosewater.

Greg Leeds succeeded Greenwood as president and CEO of WotC in March 2008. On June 6, 2008, Wizards released the fourth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and began introducing fourth-edition online content in &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazines.

Throughout the 2000s, WotC released new editions of &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. In 2009, WotC announced a new edition called &quot;,&quot; which coincided with the first major rules change to &quot;Magic&quot; since the &quot;&quot; was released in 1994.

By 2008, the company employed over 300 people and went through a restructuring. On April 6, 2009, WotC suspended all sales of its products for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games in PDF format from places such as OneBookShelf, and its online storefronts RPGNow and DriveThruRPG. The company launched a lawsuit against eight people to prevent future copyright infringement of its books, including fourth-edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; products that were sold through these places, and all older editions PDFs of the game.

=== 2010–2020 ===
In 2012, Ethan Gilsdorf writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported sales of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; products had slumped. Despite the company not releasing sales figures, analysts and gaming experts noted sales had been declining. That year, WotC announced a public playtest to develop a new edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; called &quot;D&amp;D Next&quot;. The 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was released on July 15, 2014, with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Set&quot;. In 2014, 126,870 units of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Set&quot; were sold, and in 2018, 306,670 units of the product were sold.

Throughout the 2010s, WotC and its products continued to earn awards. This included multiple 2015 Origins Awards, such as: &quot;Role-Playing Game Fan Favorite&quot; (&quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons: Players Handbook&quot;), &quot;Role-Playing Supplement&quot; &quot;Fan Favorite&quot; (&quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons: Monster Manual&quot;), and &quot;Collectible Card Game&quot; (&quot;Magic the Gathering&quot;: &quot;Khans of Tarkir&quot;). WotC won the 2015 Gold Ennie Award for &quot;Fan&#x27;s Choice for Best Publisher&quot; and won the 2017 Gold Ennie Awards for &quot;Fan&#x27;s Choice for Best Publisher&quot;.

In 2014, 20th Century Fox acquired the screen rights to &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; to produce a movie series with Simon Kinberg attached to the project. Also in 2014, WotC filed a lawsuit against Cryptozoic Entertainment and Hex Entertainment alleging their online card game &quot;&quot; was a clone of &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. The three companies agreed to a settlement the following year. In 2015, it was reported an estimated 20 million people played &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; and that the game had tournaments, a professional league, and a weekly organized game program called Friday Night Magic.

Since the release of the 5th edition, WotC has published more than twenty &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; books, including new rulebooks, campaign guides and adventure modules. According to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, 2017 had &quot;the most number of players in its history&quot;. Writing for &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, Mary Pilon reported sales of the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; rose 41 percent in 2017 compared to the year before, and in 2018 rose another 52 percent. Pilon also said in 2017, nine million people watched others play &quot;D&amp;D&quot; on the video-sharing platform Twitch.

In 2016, WotC partnered with OneBookShelf to create an online community-content platform called Dungeon Masters Guild (DMsGuild) that allowed creators to make and sell content using WotC&#x27;s properties. Users of DMsGuild could also purchase earlier editions of &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; as PDFs and as print-on-demand books.

In 2016, Chris Cocks replaced Greg Leeds as president of WotC. Giaco Furino writing for &quot;Vice&quot; reported high tensions over deadlines at the company. In 2019, WotC became a member of the Entertainment Software Association.

In April 2019, WotC announced the appointment of gaming-industry veteran James Ohlen as the head of its new studio in Austin, Texas; in January 2020 the new studio was revealed to be Archetype Entertainment. In June 2019, internet-streaming service Netflix announced WoTC would work with Anthony and Joe Russo to create an animated series based on the mythology of &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. The Russo brothers were executive producers on the series, with writers Henry Gilroy and Jose Molina as showrunners, and Bardel Entertainment worked on animation. In July 2019, Joe Deaux reported in &quot;Bloomberg&quot;: &quot;&quot;Magic&quot; is part of the [Hasbro&#x27;s] &#x27;franchise brands&#x27;, a segment that accounted for $2.45 billion in net revenue for the company last year&quot;. According to Chris Cocks, &quot;Magic&quot; accounted for a &quot;meaningful portion&quot; of that sum and KeyBanc estimated the game&#x27;s contribution was more than $500 million of the franchise brands.

In 2019, WotC released a &quot;Hearthstone&quot; competitor called &quot;&quot;, which is a free-to-play digital collectible card game with microtransaction purchases. It had been In open beta testing since September 2018. Brett Andress, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, predicted &quot;Magic: The Gathering Arena&quot; would boost earnings by at least 20 percent.

=== 2020–present ===
In February 2020, during a Hasbro earnings call, CEO Brian Goldner said Wizards of the Coast was delivering positive results and that Hasbro planned to double WotC&#x27;s revenues between 2018 and 2023. He also reported revenues from &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; had increased by over 30 percent; &quot;&quot; had a strong first year and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; revenues grew for the seventh consecutive year. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; virtual play increased by 86 percent during 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On June 1, 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, WotC released a statement in support of its Black fans, employees, and community members. This provoked a backlash; multiple open letters that criticized the company for its treatment of people of color, and documenting issues Black and Brown community members had taken with the company&#x27;s actions were published. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Polygon&quot;, and &quot;Kotaku&quot; reported following this criticism, WotC banned seven &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; cards that were deemed racially offensive from tournament-sanctioned play. The &quot;D&amp;D&quot; team announced it would be changing portions of its fifth-edition product line that fans had criticized for being insensitive, such as racist portrayals of a fictional people known as the Vistani, and races characterized as monstrous and evil. The company also announced plans to change character creation to broaden the range of character types and adding a sensitivity disclaimer to some legacy products that include cultures inspired by Asia, Mesoamerica, and the Middle East. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported the tabletop community has widely approved of these changes, although &quot;Wired&quot; criticized some of the change attempts as often feeling &quot;like lip service&quot;.

During its 2021 Investor Event, Hasbro announced the company would be reorganized into three divisions: Consumer Products, Entertainment, and Wizards &amp; Digital. The announcement was paired with a rebrand including a new logo and refreshed website for WotC. Also in 2021, WotC opened a new video-game studio, whose first project was a high-budget game based on the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; franchise. In 2022, Chris Cocks became CEO of Hasbro and Cynthia Williams replaced him as president of Wizards &amp; Digital. In June 2022, Hasbro defeated a board challenge from activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management LLC., a hedge fund company that owned a 2.5 percent stake in Hasbro and had wanted to spin out WotC into a separate company to create what it saw as &quot;more value by making a second publicly traded company with a more profitable line of business&quot;. In July 2022, WotC announced it was establishing another new video-game studio called Skeleton Key, which would focus on AAA games and would be headed by Christian Dailey, formerly of BioWare.

In April 2022, Hasbro acquired the digital toolset and game companion D&amp;D Beyond from Fandom, and transferred control to WotC the following month. At the Hasbro Investor Event in October 2022, it was announced Dan Rawson, former chief operating officer (COO) of Microsoft Dynamics 365 was appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; brand to act as head of the franchise. According to &quot;Dicebreaker&quot;, Rawson&#x27;s role was &quot;part of Wizards&#x27; plans to apply more resources to the digital side of D&amp;D&quot; following Hasbro&#x27;s purchase of D&amp;D Beyond.

At a December 2022 investor-focused web seminar, Williams and Cocks called the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; brand &quot;under monetized&quot;. They noted the high engagement of fans with the brand but said the majority of spending is by Dungeon Masters, who comprise around 20 percent of the player base. Williams commented the goal of increased investment in digital aspects of that product line was to &quot;unlock&quot; recurrent spending typical of digital games.

In 2022, &quot;The Gamer&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot; reported on the increased product-release schedule for &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;; &quot;The Gamer&quot; said the increased number of preview seasons for the game was leading to exhaustion within the community and had &quot;drained the well of enthusiasm dry&quot;. &quot;Vice&quot; commented there was &quot;a growing divide in the &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; community between the casual players and the collectors&quot; because &quot;some rich collectors have turned the cards into a kind of commodities market&quot;, and that &quot;Wizards of the Coast has increasingly catered to this kind of consumer&quot;, leading to products that are too expensive for many casual players. In November 2022, CNBC reported: &quot;Bank of America downgraded the stock of Wizard of the Coast&#x27;s owner, Hasbro&quot;; analyst Jason Haas stated changes to the &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; brand &quot;amount to Hasbro &#x27;killing its golden goose and that the &quot;primary concern&quot; is the overproduction of &quot;&quot;Magic&quot; cards which has propped up Hasbro&#x27;s recent results but is destroying the long-term value of the brand&quot;.

Between November and December 2022, there was speculation based on unconfirmed leaks saying WotC was planning to discontinue the OGL for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Following a WotC response to the speculation, the company released limited details of an update to the OGL the following month. Linda Codega, writing for &quot;Io9&quot;, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 on January 5, 2023. Codega said: &quot;every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement ... The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand.&quot; &quot;ICv2&quot; commented the leaked OGL had several controversial parts. Following this leak, numerous news-and-industry-focused outlets reported on negative reactions from fans and professional content creators. &quot;TheStreet&quot; said WotC&#x27;s main competitors quickly moved away from the OGL in the time it took WotC to settle on a response. Both Kobold Press and MCDM Productions announced upcoming new open tabletop RPG systems. Paizo announced a new Open RPG Creative License (ORC), a system-agnostic license, and other publishers joined the development of this new license. &quot;TheStreet&quot; also said WotC had united its player base against it; both &quot;TheStreet&quot; and &quot;Io9&quot; noted the movement to boycott &quot;D&amp;D Beyond&quot; and mass subscription cancellations; &quot;Io9&quot; stated the &quot;immediate financial consequences&quot; forced a response by WotC. &quot;Io9&quot; also reported WotC&#x27;s internal messaging on the response to the leak was this was a fan overreaction.

In the following weeks, WotC reversed changes to the OGL and solicited public feedback before moving away from the OGL and releasing the (SRD 5.1) under an irrevocable creative commons license (CC-BY-4.0). Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;pushback from fans, who criticized WotC&#x27;s response as far from an apology and a dismissal of their legitimate concerns, led WotC to backpedal further&quot; and that the company &quot;appears to have committed an irreversible act of self-sabotage in trying to replace [the OGL]—squandering the prestige accumulated over 20 years in a matter of weeks&quot;. Both &quot;Io9&quot; and &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called the major concessions by WotC a &quot;huge victory&quot; for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; community. The Motley Fool said the &quot;abrupt &quot;volte-face&quot;&quot; was &quot;an abject failure for Hasbro&#x27;s business&quot; if the assumed goal was to increase monetization of &quot;&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; properties, grow revenue for Hasbro, and earn more profits for Hasbro shareholders&quot;. 

Also in January 2023, WotC canceled at least five unnamed video-game projects; an internal project code-named Jabberwocky, and two games that were in the early development stages. Jason Schreier writing for &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; said fewer than 15 people at WotC would lose their jobs but &quot;the reorganization will land hard for several independent studios such as Boston-based OtherSide Entertainment and Bellevue, Washington-based Hidden Path Entertainment, both of which were working on games for Wizards of the Coast&quot;. In February 2023, &quot;Markets Insider&quot; reported Bank of America continued to rate Hasbro&#x27;s stock as underperforming and said the company &quot;faces a steep decline in its share price if it continues to &#x27;destroy customer goodwill by over-monetizing brands within its Wizards segment. In April 2023, WotC sent private detectives from the Pinkerton agency to the house of a &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; YouTuber, who said the agents demanded he destroy cards from an unreleased set he had been accidentally sent, and to remove videos from his channel, otherwise he and his wife would face a $200,000 fine and imprisonment. The game&#x27;s players subsequently initiated a boycott in response. In December 2023, TechCrunch reported that paperwork Hasbro filed with the SEC contained information announcing layoffs of 1,100 employees (20 percent of their entire workforce across all divisions) effective immediately. A wide range of WotC employees were laid off; Chase Carter of &quot;Dicebreaker&quot; commented: &quot;past successes and future plans could not save Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s workers from the hungry maw of corporate line-item reduction, and the full extent of this culling remains to be seen&quot;.

Cynthia Williams resigned at the end of April 2024 and was replaced that summer by John Hight, who left his long-time role at Blizzard Entertainment to take the job.

<text>Sex and the law deals with the regulation by law of human sexual activity. Sex laws vary from one place or jurisdiction to another, and have varied over time. Unlawful sexual acts are called sex crimes.

Some laws regarding sexual activity are intended to protect one or all participants, while others are intended to proscribe behavior that has been defined as a crime. For example, a law may proscribe unprotected sex if one person knows that they have a sexually transmitted infection or to protect a minor; or it may proscribe non-consensual sex. In general, laws may proscribe acts which are considered either sexual abuse or behavior that societies consider to be inappropriate and against the social norms. Sexual abuse is unwanted sexual contact between two or more adults or two or more minors, and, depending on laws with regard to age of consent, sexual contact between an adult and a minor.

==Definitions==
Sex crimes are forms of human sexual behavior that are considered sufficiently unacceptable and harmful to society to be regarded as criminal. Someone who commits one is said to be a &quot;sex offender&quot;. Some sex crimes are crimes of violence that involve sex. Others are violations of social taboos, such as incest, sodomy, indecent exposure or exhibitionism. There is much variation among cultures as to what is considered a crime or not, and in what ways or to what extent crimes are punished.

Western countries are often far more tolerant of acts, such as oral sex, that have traditionally been held to be crimes in some countries, but combine this with lesser tolerance for the remaining crimes. By contrast, many cultures with a strong religious tradition consider a far broader range of activities to be serious crimes.

As a general rule, the law in many countries often intervenes in sexual activity involving young or adolescent children below the legal age of consent, non-consensual deliberate displays or illicit watching of sexual activity, sex with close relatives (incest), harm to animals, acts involving the deceased (necrophilia). Intervention may also arise when there is harassment, nuisance, fear, injury, or assault of a sexual nature, or serious risk of abuse of certain professional relationships. Separately, the law usually regulates or controls the censorship of pornographic or obscene material as well.

==Possible enforcement==
The activities listed below carry a condition of illegality in some jurisdictions if acted upon:

*Rape, lust murder and other forms of sexual assault and sexual abuse
*Child sexual abuse
*Cybersex trafficking, trafficking and the live streaming of coerced sexual acts and/or rape on webcam
*Digital sex crime, the online posting of revenge porn or hidden camera recordings
*Forcible touching
*Frotteurism, sexual arousal through rubbing one&#x27;s self against a non-consenting stranger in public
*Human trafficking
*Incest between close relatives
*Necrophilia
*Obscenity
*Exhibitionism and voyeurism, if deliberate and non-consensual, called &quot;indecent exposure&quot; and &quot;peeping tom&quot; respectively in this context.
*Various paraphilias and sexual fetishes such as transvestism
*Ownership of vibrators and other sex toys
*Prostitution and/or pimping
*Public order crimes are crimes that interrupt the flow of daily life and business according to local community standards. Public order crimes include paraphilias (deviancies).
*Public urination
*Sex trafficking
*Sexual acts by people in a position of trust (such as teachers, doctors and police officers), towards people under 18 which they are involved with professionally.
*Sexual harassment
*Streaking
*Sodomy
*Spousal rape
*Statutory rape
*Telephone scatologia, making obscene telephone calls for the purpose of sexual arousal
*Stealing underwear, sometimes regarded as more serious when done in a sexual context.
A variety of laws aim to protect children by making various acts with children a sex crime. For example, the &quot;corruption of minors&quot; by introducing material or behaviors that are intended to groom a minor for future sexual conduct. The materials or behavior can involve sexual content but does not necessarily have to. Depending on the jurisdiction, this conduct can be charged as a felony or a misdemeanor. Sometimes these laws overlap with age of consent laws, laws preventing the exposure of children to pornography, laws making it a crime for a child to be involved in (or exposed to) certain sexual behaviors, and the production and ownership of child pornography (sometimes including simulated images). In some countries such as the UK, the age for child pornography is higher than the age of consent, hence child pornography laws also cover images involving consenting adults.

Sadomasochistic conduct among adults can fall into a legal grey area. Some jurisdictions criminalize some or all sadomasochistic acts, regardless of legal consent and impose liability for any injuries caused. &quot;(See Consent (BDSM))&quot; Other jurisdictions permit sadomasochistic conduct so long as the participants consent to the conduct.

== Consent ==

=== Age of consent ===

While the phrases &quot;age of consent&quot; or &quot;statutory rape&quot; typically do not appear in legal statutes, when used in relation to sexual activity, the age of consent is the minimum age at which a person is considered to be legally competent of consenting to engage in sexual acts. This should not be confused with the age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, or the marriageable age.

Some jurisdictions forbid sexual activity outside of legal marriage completely. The relevant age may also vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a position of trust. Some jurisdictions may make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a hard and fast single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a relatively low-level misdemeanor such as &quot;corruption of a minor&quot;, to &quot;statutory rape&quot; (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing).

== Extramarital sex ==
Adultery is a crime in many Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Sudan, and Yemen.

== Female genital mutilation ==
Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for female genital mutilation (FGM). FGM is the removal of the genitals, especially in Islamic culture perpetuating male domination. Approximately 125 million girls and women are victims of female genital mutilation throughout the world. With the practices often being performed to exert control over the sexual behavior of girls and women or as a perceived aesthetic improvement to the appearance of their genitalia. The World Health Organization (WHO) is one of many health organizations that have campaigned against the procedures on behalf of human rights, stating that &quot;FGM has no health benefits&quot; and that it is &quot;a violation of the human rights of girls and women&quot; and &quot;reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes&quot;.

Most countries prohibit female genital mutilation, including prohibiting the procedure to be performed on its citizens and residents while outside their jurisdictions, and the New York State Penal Law lists female genital mutilation as a sexual offense.

== Harassment ==

== Incest ==

Sexual activity between family members or close relatives is often considered incest, which is illegal in many jurisdictions, though what constitutes an &quot;incestuous relationship&quot; varies by jurisdiction, and may depend on the type of sexual activity and whether the relationship is one of consanguinity, affinity or other relationship, such as by adoption. In law, the proscribed sexual activity is usually limited to sexual intercourse, though terminology varies, and which in some jurisdictions is limited to penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. Incestuous sexual activity, as defined by each jurisdiction, is usually unlawful irrespective of the consent of the parties and irrespective of their age. This prohibition usually also extends to the marriage of people in the proscribed incestuous relationships.

One author argued that use of particular language devices and rhetoric in the legislation surrounding these laws manipulates the viewer to automatically deem such sexual acts to be immoral and criminal. In this view, the law is attempting to morally control society, which is not one of the purposes of the law. This means that people will condemn those who partake in familial sexual activities, even if all parties are consenting adults.

== LGBT rights ==
In some states, sex between members of the same sex, or between men, is illegal. In a report done in 2013, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) indicated that homosexuality is still criminalized in some form in 76 states, with a high concentration of these states in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. Scholars have found that religion plays an important role in the legislation criminalizing sodomy. Countries that are predominately Muslim, for example, are less likely to decriminalize acts of sodomy as these acts are in direct contradiction with Islamic traditions. While quantitative research has not proven a link between the continued criminalization of sodomy and Christianity, there are many Protestant denominations, as well as the Catholic Church, that oppose the practice of homosexuality. While one might expect that the decriminalization of sodomy laws would support the mobilization of lesbian and gay rights, this is not necessarily the case, as there is debate on whether or a direct link exists between the two. In legislation regarding sodomy, there is typically no explicit statements given in the support of gay and lesbian rights since the reforms generally the result of a large emendation to penal code. There is some evidence in support of the opposite effect, as the re-criminalization of sodomy in India in 2013 caused a resurgence of gay rights activism.

In studying the changes of sodomy statutes, Frank et al. (2009) found that between 1945 and 2005, &quot;90 percent of all modifications involved liberalization in some way&quot; of non-heterosexual acts. This was seen as evidence of a &quot;sodomy-law reform wave.&quot; During the same period, however, eight countries expanded their laws regarding sodomy. In January 2014, Nigeria expanded their criminalization of homosexuality by passing legislation to enforce more severe penalties including a ban against same-sex marriage and participation in any gay organizations. Sodomy laws, however, are rarely used to penalize consensual acts, involving adults, that occur in private. In the 1970s, the only arrests (in the US) involving consensual, non-heterosexual acts were in public or quasi-public. While many sodomy laws are concerned with sexual acts as opposed to sexual orientations, the legislation is often interpreted as if being gay or lesbian is sufficient evidence to deem someone guilty as to having engaged in criminal acts. This led US judges to deny parents&#x27; custody of their children, student groups were not granted recognition by university officials, and many legislators were opposed to civil rights bills that included sexual orientation.

Many revisions to sodomy laws were not a part of large government transitions, but rather included as a part of other general revisions of criminal legislation. There are two main pathways in which sodomy laws have been decriminalized: judicial invalidation and repeal of the law by vote of legislation. The United States did not decriminalize sodomy nationwide until 2003; however, many states, based on the council of judges and lawyers, did decriminalize sodomy as early as 1961.

During the rise of Putin, Russia has seen a resurgence in &quot;religious conservatism&quot; which has resulted in the indirect re-criminalizing homosexuality. An amendment was made to Russian legislation in 2013 that emphasizes the protection of children from information that could be deemed as damaging to their mental health and development. In the amendment to the Federal Law of Russian Federation no. 436-FZ, &quot;propaganda&quot; of non-traditional sexual relationships among minors was classified as harmful, and while the law does not criminalize homosexuality directly, it has created a hostile environment for LGBT activism. The US and Europe have condemned Russia&#x27;s actions, but despite the domestic and international pushback, the Russian anti-LGBT propaganda law still stands.

<text>A sex toy is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate sexual pleasure, such as a dildo, artificial vagina or vibrator. Many popular sex toys are designed to resemble human genitals, and may be vibrating or non-vibrating. The term &quot;sex toy&quot; can also include BDSM apparatus and sex furniture such as sex swings; however, it is not applied to items such as birth control, pornography, or condoms. Alternative terms for &quot;sex toy&quot; include adult toy and the dated euphemism marital aid. &quot;Marital aid&quot; also has a broader meaning and is applied to drugs and herbs marketed to enhance or prolong sex.

Sex toys are most commonly sold at sex shops or online, but they may also be sold in a pharmacy or chemist store, a pornographic store, a head shop, or a department store. Sex toys are available in almost all countries for males and females.

==Types==
=== Erotic electrostimulation ===

Another form of sex toys for both men and women are those for erotic electrostimulation. Erotic electrostimulation refers to the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation. By the mid-1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.

===Erotic furniture===
Erotic furniture is furniture specially shaped for comfort, penetration levels, and stimulation. Also known as sex furniture, it is a form of furniture that can act as an aid to sexual activity. While almost anything can be used for this purpose, with the most common form of furniture employed for sexual activity being the bed, couches and sofas, these are not strictly erotic furniture, as their primary use is not erotic. 

Specifically designed furniture for erotic purposes can include:
* Devices for spanking and flagellation such as the Berkley Horse
* Devices for using gravity to aid in lovemaking without the use of complicated slings
* Fisting slings - used for positioning the person receiving when fisting
* Sex gliders - can aid in positioning or have an attached dildo for individual pleasure
* Sex swings
* Various types of angled foam wedges or specially designed pillows that support various sex positions, e.g., Liberator Shapes or the ergonomically based Lovebumpers
Erotic furniture can also act as an aid for those with physical disabilities, whether intentionally or unintentionally, putting less strain on the body or even making some positions attainable. A few examples of erotic furniture that frequently do this are angled foam wedges and pillows, some sex swings, and sex gliders specifically designed for people with spinal injury and paralysis from the midsection and down.

===General penetrative toys===
* Ben Wa balls are hollow metal balls inserted vaginally which can be worn inside the vagina for extended periods of time. The internal rolling is claimed to enhance orgasms.
* A dildo is a non-vibrating device which is used for sexual stimulation of the vagina or anus. Dildos are generally made of silicone rubber, but can be made of other materials such as body safe metals such as titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, or glass. They are often made to resemble a penis, although some are C-shaped or S-shaped for G-spot or P-spot stimulation.
** A double penetration dildo is a long, usually flexible dildo with both ends designed for penetration. It allows for mutual penetration between two persons (or for double penetration of a single female, both anally and vaginally).
** A strap-on dildo is a dildo worn in a harness, used to penetrate another person.
* A horseshoe is a non-vibrating sex toy, shaped similar to a horseshoe, which is put into the vagina and anus at the same time. It is made with softer plastics.
* Kegel exerciser, also known as vaginal barbells, eggs, or jugglers, are designed to improve muscle tone in the pelvic floor, and can be used for sexual pleasure as well as enhancing vaginal response.
* A sex machine is a motor-driven device that combines penetration with rotational or reciprocal movement, or both.

====Anal toys====

* Anal beads
* Butt plugs are often shorter dildos intended for anal insertion. They tend to have a flared base to prevent the device from becoming sucked into the rectum.
* Prostate massagers are devices designed to stimulate a prostate for health and pleasure.

====Glass sex toys====

Glass sex toys are commonly made from clear medical grade borosilicate glass (&quot;hard glass&quot;). This particular type of safety toughened glass is non-toxic and will withstand extreme temperatures as well as physical shock without compromising its structural integrity.

The choice of this high-grade material provides safety in use and the option to heat or chill the toys. Borosilicate glass is also non-porous and can be sterilized to help prevent infection with reuse. The highest quality glass toys can even be put in the dishwasher making them easier to keep clean. As well as their practical qualities, a main selling point of glass sex toys is their visual appeal.

Some glass sex toys vibrate. There are two main ways this can be achieved. Either the toy may have a hole into which a small bullet vibrator can be inserted, or the core of the glass design can be modified to form a standard vibrator. The latter option usually has a plastic cap covering the battery compartment, which will also house any control buttons or switches.

====Vibrators====

Vibrators are electric motor-powered devices intended to stimulate the body by creating a pulsating or buzzing sensation. Vibrators come in a range of shapes and sizes, for internal or external use. Some vibrators intended for internal use are phallic in shape. Small vibrators may have a stretchy loop attachment for use as a finger toy or cock ring. Penetrative vibrators usually measure twelve to eighteen cm (five to seven inches) in length and two to five cm (one to two inches) wide often to mimic the size of the average human penis.

* Anal vibrators are designed to be inserted into the rectum, which may stimulate the prostate in men. The safest ones have a flared base which remains outside the body, that prevents the toy from becoming irretrievable.
* Bullet vibrators are small, bullet-shaped vibrators that can be used for direct stimulation or inserted into other sex toys to increase stimulation. Some are sold with stretchy loops for attachment as a finger toy or cock ring.
* G-spot vibrators are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the female G-spot.
* P-spot vibrators are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the male P-spot.
* Luxury vibrators have an increased focus on design and the use of expensive materials that appeal to a more upscale fashion market.
* The rabbit vibrator, of which there are several variations, is a popular female sex toy popularized by the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. It comprises an insertable shaft which often has additional functionality, such as rotation and internal beads or a thrusting action. Attached to the shaft is a vibrating clitoral stimulator. For most rabbit vibrators this comes in the form of &quot;bunny ears&quot; which sit each side of the clitoris.
* Sybians are dual-area vibrators in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator, designed to stimulate the two erogenous zones simultaneously and independently.

===Nipple toys===
* Nipple clamps are clamps used to stimulate the nipples by applying varying degrees of pressure.
* Suction devices are generally either rubber or glass.

===Penile toys===

* Artificial vaginas, also known as &quot;pocket pussies&quot;, &quot;male masturbators&quot;, or &quot;strokers&quot;, are tubes made of soft material to simulate sexual intercourse. The material and often textured inner canal are designed to stimulate the penis and induce orgasm. The male masturbators come in many shapes and styles; they can be shaped like vulvas, anuses, mouths, or as non-descriptive holes. Some male masturbators are disposable and some can be washed and used repeatedly. Some are equipped with sex machine options that work similar to milking machines.
* A cock harness is a more elaborate harness designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with BDSM activities such as cock and ball torture. An Arab strap is one such form of harness, purported to be a device used for maintaining an erection.
* Cock rings prolong male erection by holding blood inside the penis. A man may wear a cock ring to combat erectile difficulties, or for the sensation of tightness and engorgement that wearing one provides. Some models include a protruding clitoral stimulator, designed to stimulate the clitoris during sex. Others vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or in a popular &#x27;Dolphin&#x27; variant by using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to both the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings also have vibrators attached which can be worn to stimulate a partner during sexual intercourse, especially in the scrotum or perineum. Yet other cock rings have arms that rub and apply pressure to the perineum of the wearer.
** A triple crown is a special cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In orgasm, the testicles usually retract toward the body before ejaculation. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.
* A docking sleeve is a cylindrical device similar to a penis sleeve, but is open at both ends, so that two men can dock.
* An FTM stroker is a pocket-pussy-style toy designed &quot;for [the] t-cock/enlarged clitoris&quot; of a transgender man on hormone replacement therapy. In 2016, Buck Angel released the first such device, the Buck-Off.
* A penis extension is a partially hollow device like a very short dildo, with the hollow end placed on the end of the penis, intended to increase the effective length of the penis, again for the benefit of the person being penetrated. These are generally worn with condoms to prevent them from falling off during use.
* A penis sleeve is a cylindrical device that is placed on the shaft of the penis, with the aim of increasing stimulation for the person being penetrated. They often have soft bumps intended to provide further stimulation.
*Urethral sounds are rods, known after the nautical &quot;sounding rods&quot; that measure water depth, — usually silicone or metal, often with a ball at one end — inserted into the urethra for sexual stimulation. There are sounding rods for women, but they are used far less.

===Vulvar toys===
* Vibrator wands, such as the Hitachi Magic Wand, are large vibrators that generally plug into an electrical outlet (versus operating on battery power) and are often marketed as back massagers. They are able to produce far more powerful vibration than most battery-powered vibrators. Various attachments made of silicone or a rubber material allow the toy to be used penetratively, or give the toy more interesting texture.
* Clitoral vibrators are designed to stimulate the clitoris by direct contact.
* The Womanizer is a clitoral stimulator that uses air vibrations and suction.
* Clitoral clamps are used to stimulate the clitoris by applying pressure and restricting blood flow.
* Pussy pumps and clitoral pumps are used to sensitize the genital area prior to masturbation or sex with a partner.
* Clitoral suction toys consist mainly of a small tunnel that when placed around the clitoris and powered on, creates a feeling of suction.

==History==

=== Dildos ===

Dildos in one form or another have existed widely in history. Artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic of a type called bâton de commandement have been speculated to have been used for sexual purposes. Few archaeologists consider these items as sex toys, but archaeologist Timothy Taylor put it, &quot;Looking at the size, shape, and—some cases—explicit symbolism of the ice age batons, it seems disingenuous to avoid the most obvious and straightforward interpretation. But it has been avoided.&quot;

The first dildos were made of stone, tar, wood, bone, ivory, limestone, teeth, and other materials that could be shaped as penises and that were firm enough to be used as penetrative sex toys. Scientists believe that a 20-centimeter siltstone phallus from the Upper Palaeolithic period 30,000 years ago, found in Hohle Fels Cave near Ulm, Germany, may have been used as a dildo. Prehistoric double-headed dildos have been found which date anywhere from 13 to 19,000 years ago. Various paintings from ancient Egypt around 3000 BCE feature dildos being used in a variety of ways. In medieval times, a plant called the &quot;cantonese groin&quot; was soaked in hot water to enlarge and harden for women to use as dildos. Dildo-like breadsticks, known as &quot;olisbokollikes&quot; (sing. &quot;olisbokollix&quot;), were known in Ancient Greece prior to the 5th century BC. In Italy during the 1400s, dildos were made of leather, wood, or stone. Chinese women in the 15th century used dildos made of lacquered wood with textured surfaces, and were sometimes buried with them. Nashe&#x27;s early-1590s work &quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot; mentions a dildo made from glass. Dildos also appeared in 17th and 18th century Japan, in shunga. In these erotic novels, women are shown enthusiastically buying dildos, some made out of water buffalo horns.

Dildos were not just used for sexual pleasure. Examples from the Eurasia Ice Age (40,000-10,000 BCE) and Roman era are speculated to have been used for defloration rituals.

Many references to dildos exist in the historical and ethnographic literature. Haberlandt, for example, illustrates single and double-ended wooden dildos from late 19th century Zanzibar. With the invention of modern materials, making dildos of different shapes, sizes, colors and textures became more practical.

==== Ancient Greece ====

Greek dildos were often made out of leather stuffed with wool in order to give it varying degrees of thickness and firmness. They were often lubricated with olive oil, and used for sexual practice and other activities. The Greeks were also one of the first groups to use the term &quot;toy&quot; in reference to a dildo. Dildos may be seen in some examples of ancient Greek vase art. Some pieces show their use in group sex or in solitary female masturbation. One vessel, of about the sixth century BCE, depicts a scene in which a woman bends over to perform oral sex on a man, while another man is about to thrust a dildo into her anus.

Page DuBois, a classicist and feminist theorist, suggests that dildos were present in Greek art because the ancient Greek male imagination found it difficult to conceive of sex taking place without penetration. Therefore, female masturbation or sex between women required an artificial phallus to be used.

=== Vibrators ===
Electromechanical vibrators were first invented by Joseph Mortimer Granville in the late 1880s. Its intended use was to treat muscle pains in men, not a sexual device.

Several theories have been proposed to explain how the technology grew to also have sexual uses. Rachel Maines&#x27; claims in &quot;The Technology of Orgasm&quot; about physicians using vibrators to cure hysteria through inducing an orgasm (referred to at the time as a &#x27;paroxysm&#x27;) have been widely cited in academic documents and the media as the origins of vibrators&#x27; sexual origins. However, these claims lack valid evidence.

Hallie Lieberman&#x27;s more plausible historical account is that American vibrator companies started targeting household appliance and electrotherapeutic device markets in the early 1900s. It was advertised overtly as a tool to relax, assist with labor in the home, and a general medical cure-all, but coded language and imagery hinted at its potential sexual uses as well.

In the late 1960s, sex-positive second-wave feminist Betty Dodson organized group mastrubation workshops in New York City, encouraging women to become more independent sexually. In these sessions, Dodson encouraged the use of the Hitachi Magic Wand, a wand vibrator intended for muscle pain relief. Inspired by her workshops, Dell Williams launched “Eve’s Garden” in the same city, which marked history as the first feminist sex toy shop in the US.

This movement culturally rebranded the product as a sex toy, although Hitachi would not market it for its sexual uses. Although Hitachi briefly ceased manufacturing of the product in 2013 due to concerns of being associated to a popular sex toy, they later decided to continue manufacturing it under as the &quot;Original Magic Wand&quot; under the sex toy distribution company Vibratex.

==In literature==

Dildos are mentioned several times in Aristophanes&#x27; comedy of 411 BCE, &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.

:LYSISTRATA
:And so, girls, when fucking time comes […] not the faintest whiff of it anywhere, right? From the time those Milesians betrayed us, we can&#x27;t even find our eight-fingered leather dildos. At least they&#x27;d serve as a sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts […] So, then! Would you like me to find some mechanism by which we could end this war?

Herodas&#x27; short comic play, &quot;Mime VI&quot;, written in the 3rd century BCE, is about a woman called Metro, anxious to discover from a friend where she recently acquired a dildo.

:METRO
:I beg you, don&#x27;t lie,
:dear Corrioto: who was the man who stitched for you this bright red dildo?

She eventually discovers the maker to be a man called Kerdon, who hides his trade by the front of being a cobbler, and leaves to seek him out. Metro and Kerdon are main characters in the next play in the sequence, &quot;Mime VII&quot;, when she visits his shop.

=== Talmud ===

The Talmud&#x27;s Avodah Zarah Tractate records the interpretation which Rav Yosef bar Hiyya gave to the Biblical reference of King Asa of Judah having &quot;deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as Queen Mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down and burned it in the Kidron Valley&quot; ( Kings 15:13, 2 Chronicles 15:16). According to Rav Yosef, Maakah had installed &quot;the likeness of a male organ&quot; on her Asherah image &quot;and she would engage in sexual activity with it daily&quot;.

=== Early modern period ===
In the early 1590s, the English playwright Thomas Nashe wrote a poem known as &quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot;, &quot;Nashe&#x27;s Dildo&quot; or &quot;The Merrie Ballad of Nashe his Dildo&quot;. This was not printed at the time, due to its obscenity but it was still widely circulated and made Nashe&#x27;s name notorious. The poem describes a visit to a brothel by a man called &quot;Tomalin&quot;; he is searching for his sweetheart, Francis, who has become a prostitute. The only way he can see her is to hire her. However, she resorts to using a glass dildo as he finds himself unable to perform sexually to her satisfaction.

Dildos are humorously mentioned in Act IV, scene iv of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. This play and Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1610) are typically cited as the first use of the word in publication (Nashe&#x27;s &quot;Merrie Ballad&quot; was not published until 1899).

In 1673, the parliament of the United-Kingdom refused the marriage between the presumed heir of the throne, James of York, and the Catholic Maria d&#x27;Este of Modena. The same year, John Wilmot, the seventeenth-century English libertine, published the poem &quot;Signor Dildo&quot; parodying the situation, stating the coming of Maria d&#x27;Este would provoke a great import of dildoes; the poem among other things states:

:You ladies all of merry England
:Who have been to kiss the Duchess&#x27;s hand,
:Pray, did you not lately observe in the show
:A noble Italian called Signor Dildo?

This ballad was subsequently added to by other authors, and became so popular that &quot;Signor&quot; became a term for a dildo. In the epilogue to &quot;The Mistaken Husband&quot; (1674), by John Dryden, an actress complains:

:To act with young boys is loving without men.
:What will not poor forsaken women try?
:When man&#x27;s not near, the Signior must supply.

Many other works of bawdy and satirical English literature of the period deal with the subject. &quot;Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem&quot; (London, 1706), attributed to Samuel Butler, is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities. Examples of anonymous works include &quot;The Bauble, a tale&quot; (London, 1721) and &quot;Monsieur Thing&#x27;s Origin: or Seignor D---o&#x27;s Adventures in London&quot; (London, 1722). In 1746, Henry Fielding wrote &quot;The Female Husband: or the surprising history of Mrs Mary, alias Mr. George Hamilton&quot;, in which a woman posing as a man uses a dildo. This was a fictionalized account of the story of Mary Hamilton.

Dildos are obliquely referred to in Saul Bellow&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; (1953): &quot;he had brought me along to a bachelor&#x27;s stag where two naked acrobatic girls did stunts with false tools&quot;. A dildo called &quot;Steely Dan III from Yokohama&quot; appears in the William S. Burroughs novel &quot;The Naked Lunch&quot; (1959). The rock band Steely Dan took their name from it.

==Health, safety, and privacy concerns==

Standards set for sex toys are set in ISO 3533:2021. The sex toys are sold as novelty items so they do not need to adhere to certain regulations such as reporting the chemicals and materials used in a product. Due to this status, manufacturers are not responsible if their toys are used for any other purpose than being a novelty. Regulations such as REACH do exist, and some sex toys may be compliant to this though, despite that there is no obligation for manufacturers on attaining compliance. A 2006 study conducted by the Greenpeace Netherlands office found high level of phthalates in seven out of eight plastic sex toys tested. Phthalates are chemical plasticizers that are added as softeners, to create the malleable and soft effect that many look for in sex toys.

Sex toys are classified as novelties in the United States because the Food and Drug Administration has extensive testing and financial requirements in order for sex toys to be classified as medical devices. Therefore, sex toy manufacturers more often choose less complex production by labeling them a novelty, where their listed ingredients do not have to be accurate in chemical composition or percentage of ingredients. Due to the novelty classification, sex toys may contain toxins such as phthalates, which have been banned in children&#x27;s toys by the CPSC.

Before using a sex toy, owners should take precautions. One should check for tears, rough seams or cracks that could harm the inside of the vagina or anus. Condoms should also be used on porous sex toys and sex toys that are being shared between two or more partners. They should also use appropriate lubricants; silicone lube will break down silicone toys, and oil-based lubes will break down latex condoms.

With the rise of smart sex toys, so did concerns surrounding unwanted tracking or hacking that could occur due to database and API issues. In 2016, the security software company Trend Micro demonstrated that some Internet-connected electronic sex toys are vulnerable to cyberattacks, thus creating the field of onion dildonics. The ethical, legal, and privacy concerns are an area of active research by Sarah Jamie Lewis, amongst others. She warns that sex toys are just as vulnerable to malware as any other device, so manufacturers and companies should be more transparent about their data collection policies in order to protect users.

==Care==
Cleaning sex toys is also very important for sexual health and sex toy safety. Cleaning them will avoid the potential of bacterial infection, transmission of STIs (if shared), or pregnancy (if sperm is present on the toy). Porous sex toys (ridged, flexible, soft and squishy) are difficult to clean and can hide bacteria that multiply and harm the human body. Non-porous toys are easier to clean, making them less potentially harmful. When cleaning sex toys, always use warm water and unscented anti-bacterial soap.

;Anal toys (butt plugs, small dildos, etc.)
*When used in the anus, sex toys can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object upward, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this serious problem, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string.

;Non-porous toys
* Hard plastic toys: do not boil the toy, and wash with soap and water.
* Silicone toys: put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, boil for 5–10 minutes, or wash with water and soap.
* Stainless steel toys: boil or soak them in 1:10 bleach-water solution for ten minutes, put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, or use soap and water (if there are electrical components to the toy).

;Porous toys
* Cyberskin and vinyl toys: clean with warm water, air dry, and sprinkle it with a small amount of cornstarch (to keep them dry and not sticky).
* Nylon toys: put it in the top rack of the dishwasher or wash with soap and water.
* Rubber toys: cannot be properly cleaned because bacteria is absorbed into the material, so it is recommended to always use a condom.

==Legal issues==

===India===
Sex toys are illegal in India. Selling sex toys is a punishable offense under section 292 of the Indian penal code, as sex toys are considered an &quot;obscene&quot; product. Besides sex toys, any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation, figure or any other object, is also considered obscene by section 292 if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest. The punishment for the offense is up to two years in prison.

===Japan===
In Japan, many dildos are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as Hello Kitty, rabbits or dolphins, so that they may be sold as toys, thus avoiding obscenity laws.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the sale and importation of sex toys is illegal.

===South Africa===
Section 18A of the Sexual Offenses Act, 1957, inserted by the Immorality Amendment Act, 1969, prohibited the manufacture or sale of any item &quot;intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act&quot;. The term &quot;unnatural sexual act&quot; referred to any sex other than vaginal heterosexual sex, and this prohibition was ostensibly aimed at preventing the use of dildos by lesbians. No longer enforced, the section was repealed by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007.

===United States===

Sex toys and lubricants have become increasingly available in major commercial outlets in the United States. On-shelf displays tend to be more discreet than the offerings on web sites. These items tend to be displayed in the &quot;sexual health&quot; sections of stores.

Until recently, many Southern and some Great Plains states banned the sale of sex toys completely, either directly or through laws regulating &quot;obscene devices&quot;. In 1999, William H. Pryor, Jr., an assistant attorney general in Alabama commenting on a case involving sex toys and discussing to what end the devices are used, was quoted as saying there is no &quot;fundamental right for a person to buy a device to produce orgasm&quot;. A federal appeals court upheld Alabama&#x27;s law prohibiting the sale of sex toys on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 2007.

In February 2008, a federal appeals court overturned a Texas statute banning the sales of sex toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution&#x27;s 14th Amendment on the right to privacy. The appeals court cited &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, where the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at &quot;enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct&quot;. Similar statutes have been struck down in Kansas and Colorado.

Marty Klein, author of &quot;America&#x27;s War on Sex&quot; and an advocate for the moral value of sex toys, has described the sex toy bans as a form of erotophobia and genophobia, claiming the &quot;extraordinary erosion of personal liberty, coupled with the massive disrespect of and fear of sexuality is no joke&quot; and that the &quot;Supreme Court [of the United States] has declared our orgasms a battlefield, and sex toys another casualty.&quot;

===Zimbabwe===
A portion of the &quot;censorship and entertainments control&quot; law in Zimbabwe illegalizes the possession and importation of sex toys, because they are considered &quot;obscene&quot; or &quot;indecent&quot;, and harmful to public morals. Being in possession of a sex toy or other prohibited and indecent material can result in a fine (maximum level 6 or US$300) and/or imprisonment not exceeding one year.

==Industry==
As of 2023, the sex toy industry is estimated to be valued at $35.2 billion worldwide. By 2030, the predicted value of this industry may rise to $62.7 billion. Seventy percent of sex toys are manufactured in China. Sex toys are sold in various types of local and online sex shops, at conventions associated with the adult industry, and at parties. However, some items, such as &quot;hand-held massagers&quot;, are sold in mainstream retail outlets such as drugstores. The rise of online shopping/retailers contributed to the rapid growth of the sex toy industry, making them easy and discreet to buy. After COVID-19 lockdowns, sex toy sales increased by 60%.

==In popular culture==
* On &quot;Millionaire Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Sex Toy Dave&quot; Levine - who earned a fortune selling adult toys and wanted Patti to find him a mate, preferably bisexual, who would accept him as he is - was featured as one of Patti Stanger&#x27;s clients.
*On &quot;Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot;, Kandi Burruss frequently discusses, displays, and gives other cast members gifts from her sex toy line, &quot;Bedroom Kandi&quot;, which she also promotes via her online show, &quot;Kandi Koated Nights&quot;.

==Research==
Sex toys have been the subject of scientific research in different disciplines (e.g., medicine, clinical psychology, sexology, queer studies) for decades.

Some questionnaire and interview studies on the prevalence of sex toy have shown that people of all genders and all sexual identities use sex toys during solo sex (masturbation) and - somewhat less frequently - during partner sex. In some countries (e.g., Australia, China, Germany, USA) sex toys are normalized, i.e. they are already used by large sections of the population, sometimes by the majority of the population. These studies also that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely to have used a vibrator before, with around half of gay or bisexual men and over 75% of lesbian or bisexual women having used one before.

The Internet has contributed to the popularization of sex toys, since information searches about and the purchase of sex toys can now be carried out discreetly online.

Many women do not insert vibrators, but use them externally for direct clitoral stimulation, either during masturbation or during intercourse. Homosexual identified men, on the other hand, report much more frequently that they use vibrators for anal insertion.

According to a 2016 study in &quot;Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society&quot;, in Mexico City, women sometimes buy sex toys to punish their male partners, typically for infidelity.

===Positive and negative effects of sex toy use===
The meanings and implications of sex toys are controversially discussed in academia. Many authors endorse them for fostering sexual empowerment, while some criticize sex toys for pushing the commercialization of sex.

Most empirical studies show that people of all genders and sexual identities experience the use of sex toys predominantly positively. In questionnaires and interviews, they report an increase in sexual arousal and satisfaction, the facilitation of orgasms (especially for women), the exploration of new preferences, a playful approach to sex and the fun of something new during sex. There are decidedly feminist or women-oriented sex toy stores and sex toy party organizations that link the sale of sex toys with sexual education and aim to support women&#x27;s sexual empowerment. Further positive effects are reported from clinical settings: Sex toys are used therapeutically, for example, in the context of therapy for orgasm disorders. They can also enable people with disabilities to have more sexual self-determination.

It may also help couples feel more satisfied with sex. One surveying 50 couples found that both men and women in heterosexual couples often appreciate the addition of a toy, possibly because it reduced performance pressure for men and increased the excitement women had for sex. There are conflicting opinions in the literature about whether sex toys contribute to performance pressure.

Some empirical research has demonstrated negative effects of sex toy use such as sexually transmitted infections (when sex toys are shared without proper cleaning or without barrier methods such as condoms), injuries (e.g., from anal insertion of toys unsuitable for anal use), or allergies. Some women also report that they are urged by their partners to use sex toys even though they do not want to.

<text>The &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair of 1962 () was a political scandal in West Germany. It stemmed from the publication of an article in &quot;Der Spiegel,&quot; West Germany&#x27;s weekly political magazine, about the nation&#x27;s defense forces. Several &quot;Spiegel&quot; staffers were detained on charges of treason, but were ultimately released without trial.

The scandal stemmed from a conflict between Franz Josef Strauss, federal minister of defense, and Rudolf Augstein, owner and editor-in-chief of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. The affair cost Strauss his office and, according to some commentators, put the post-war West German democracy to its first successful test of press freedom.

== Cause ==
Strauss and Augstein had clashed in 1961, when &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; raised accusations of bribery in favor of the FIBAG construction company, which had received a contract for building military facilities. A parliamentary enquiry, however, found no evidence against Strauss.

The quarrel escalated when the 10 October 1962 issue of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; presented an article by Conrad Ahlers, &quot;Bedingt abwehrbereit&quot; (&quot;Conditionally Ready to Defend&quot;), about a NATO exercise called &quot;Fallex 62&quot;. The piece &quot;included details about the performance of West Germany’s defense forces&quot; and &quot;a NATO commander’s assessment that found the West German forces to be only partially ready to defend the country.&quot;

The magazine was accused of treason (&quot;Landesverrat&quot;) &quot;by publishing details that a hastily compiled Defense Ministry document claimed were state secrets&quot;. At 9 p.m. on 26 October, its offices in Hamburg, as well as the homes of several journalists, were raided and searched by 36 policemen, who confiscated thousands of documents. Augstein and editors-in-chief Claus Jacobi and Johannes Engel were arrested. The author of the article, Ahlers, who was vacationing in Spain, was arrested in his hotel during the night. Augstein was in custody for 103 days. The offices remained under police occupation for four weeks, while the magazine continued to appear each week, produced not without some difficulty, elsewhere.

Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was informed of Strauss&#x27; actions. However, Wolfgang Stammberger, the Minister of Justice, belonging to the smaller coalition FDP, was deliberately left out of all decisions. News of the arrests caused riots and protest throughout West Germany. Strauss initially denied all involvement, even before the &quot;Bundestag&quot;; Adenauer, in another speech, complained about an &quot;abyss of treason&quot; &quot;(&quot;Abgrund von Landesverrat&quot;)&quot;.

Strauss was finally forced to admit that he had phoned the military attaché of the West German embassy to Spain in Madrid and urged the attaché to have Ahlers arrested. This was clearly illegal – as Minister of the Interior Hermann Höcherl paraphrased, &quot;etwas außerhalb der Legalität&quot; (&quot;somewhat outside of legality&quot;). Since Strauss had lied to the parliament, on 19 November the five FDP ministers of the cabinet resigned, demanding that Strauss be fired. This put Adenauer himself at risk. He found himself publicly accused of backing the suppression of a critical press with the resources of the state.

== Conclusion ==
On 26 November, the police ended their occupation of the &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; offices, while Augstein, Ahlers and three others remained under arrest – Augstein until 7 February 1963. In December 1962, Adenauer formed a new coalition with the Free Democratic Party but Strauss and Stammberger were left out of power.

On 13 May 1965, the &quot;Bundesgerichtshof&quot; (highest German court of appeals) refused to commence trial proceedings against Augstein and Ahlers, ruling that during the affair Strauss had exceeded his competencies and committed &quot;Freiheitsberaubung&quot; (deprivation of personal freedom); however, because of his belief of acting lawfully (&quot;Verbotsirrtum&quot;), he was exempt from punishment. The case also came before the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which issued a groundbreaking ruling in August 1966 that laid down the basics of the freedom of the press for decades to come.

==Aftermath==
The scandal temporarily halted Strauss&#x27; political career and was remembered by many when Strauss ran for Chancellor in 1980, clearly losing against his SPD opponent (and incumbent) Helmut Schmidt. However, it is mostly remembered for altering the political culture of post-war West Germany and – with the first mass demonstrations and public protests – being a turning point from the old &quot;Obrigkeitsstaat&quot; (authoritarian state) to a modern democracy. The British historian Frederick Taylor argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian &quot;deep state&quot; that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian outlook in favour of the more democratic values that came to be seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic.

Augstein became one of International Press Institute&#x27;s 50 &quot;Hero of World Press Freedom&quot; laureates in 2000 for his role in the Spiegel scandal. The scandal was the closure of a reactionary period and the parochial culture in West Germany.

==Movie adaptation==
The &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair was adapted into a German television film, &quot;&quot;, which was broadcast in May 2014 on Arte and ARD. The film was criticized by Rudolf Augstein&#x27;s daughter, for containing many historical inaccuracies, in particular for inappropriately focusing on personal conflicts between Strauss and Augstein to the detriment of covering the actual political and judicial conflict in the society.

<doc id="146577" wikidata="Q3441204" url="?curid=146577" title="Romer v. Evans">
<text>Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with sexual orientation and state laws. It was the first Supreme Court case to address gay rights since &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986), when the Court had held that laws criminalizing sodomy were constitutional.

The Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that a state constitutional amendment in Colorado preventing protected status based upon homosexuality or bisexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. The majority opinion in &quot;Romer&quot; stated that the amendment lacked &quot;a rational relationship to legitimate state interests&quot;, and the dissent stated that the majority &quot;evidently agrees that &#x27;rational basis&#x27;—the normal test for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause—is the governing standard&quot;. The state constitutional amendment failed rational basis review.

The decision in &quot;Romer&quot; set the stage for &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003), where the Court overruled its decision in &quot;Bowers&quot;; for the Supreme Court ruling striking down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013); and for the Court&#x27;s ruling striking down state bans on same-sex marriage in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015). Justice Anthony Kennedy authored all four opinions, and was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer in every one.

==Passage of Amendment 2==

In 1992, Colorado voters approved by initiative an amendment to the Colorado state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize homosexuals or bisexuals as a protected class. The amendment stated:

That amendment was approved by a vote of 53% to 47%. According to public opinion surveys, Coloradans strongly opposed discrimination based upon sexual orientation, but at the same time they opposed affirmative action based upon sexual orientation, and the latter concern is what led to the adoption of Amendment 2. The governor of Colorado, Roy Romer, opposed the measure, but also opposed retaliatory boycotts against his state.

==Proceedings in state court==
Richard G. Evans, a gay man who worked for Denver mayor Wellington Webb, as well as other individuals and three Colorado municipalities, brought suit to enjoin the amendment. A former Colorado Supreme Court justice, Jean Dubofsky, was the lead attorney. A state trial court issued a permanent injunction against the amendment, and upon appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the amendment was subject to &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; under the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution. The state trial court, upon remand, concluded that the amendment could not pass strict scrutiny, which the Colorado Supreme Court agreed with upon review. Both times, the Colorado Supreme Court rendered 2–1 decisions.

The state supreme court held that Amendment 2 infringed on the fundamental right of gays to participate equally in the political process. Regarding the trial court&#x27;s finding that homosexuals were not a suspect class, the Colorado Supreme Court said: &quot;This ruling has not been appealed and thus, we do not address it.&quot;

The majority of the Colorado Supreme Court acknowledged that Amendment 2 would not affect Colorado law that generally protects people from discrimination:

The dissenting justice on the Colorado Supreme Court argued that neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right was involved in the case, and thus he would have applied a rational basis test instead of strict scrutiny.

==U.S. Supreme Court ruling==
The case was argued on October 10, 1995. On May 20, 1996, the court ruled 6–3 that Colorado&#x27;s Amendment 2 was unconstitutional, though on different reasoning from the Colorado courts. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, and was joined by John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. The Court majority held that the Colorado constitutional amendment targeting homosexuals based upon animosity lacked a rational relation to any legitimate governmental purpose.

Regarding the state&#x27;s argument that Amendment 2 blocked homosexuals merely from receiving &quot;special rights&quot;, Kennedy wrote:

While leaving that question unresolved by his opinion, Kennedy concluded that the amendment imposed a special disability upon homosexuals by forbidding them to seek safeguards &quot;without constraint&quot;. Instead of applying &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; to Amendment 2 (as the Colorado Supreme Court had done), Kennedy wrote that it did not even meet the much lower requirement of having a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose:

And:

Kennedy did not go into depth in rejecting the claims put forward in support of the law (e.g. protecting the rights of landlords to evict gay tenants if they found homosexuality morally offensive), instead holding that the law was so unique as to &quot;confound this normal process of judicial review&quot; and &quot;defies ... conventional inquiry.&quot; He elaborated: &quot;It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort.&quot;

Finding that &quot;laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected,&quot; the Court inferred that the passage of Amendment 2 was born of a &quot;bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group&quot;. The Court added: &quot;[I]f the constitutional conception of &#x27;equal protection of the laws&#x27; means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a &quot;legitimate&quot; governmental interest.&quot;(emphasis added) The majority opinion in &quot;Romer&quot; neither mentioned nor overruled the Court&#x27;s prior opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, which allowed outright bans on homosexual activity.

==Dissenting opinion==
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the dissent, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas. Scalia asserted that Amendment 2 did not deprive anyone of the &quot;protection [afforded by] general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings&quot;, which he said was confirmed by the Colorado Supreme Court and not disputed by Justice Kennedy&#x27;s opinion. Scalia&#x27;s dissent said Amendment 2 merely provided that homosexuals &quot;cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws&quot;. His objections also included these:

* Regarding the Court&#x27;s earlier decision in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, Scalia wrote: &quot;If it is rational to criminalize the conduct, surely it is rational to deny special favor and protection to those with a self-avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct.&quot;
* &quot;Davis v. Beason&quot; (1890) had held that laws against polygamy were not an &quot;impermissible targeting&quot; of polygamists, and Scalia asked: &quot;Has the Court concluded that the perceived social harm of polygamy is a &#x27;legitimate concern of government&#x27;, and the perceived social harm of homosexuality is not?&quot;
* The Court, Scalia said, was engaged in judicial activism; as the Constitution says nothing on the topic, it should be decided by democratic processes. The dissent added: &quot;it [is] no business of the courts (as opposed to the political branches) to take sides in this culture war. But the Court today has done so, not only by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine to take the victory away from traditional forces, but even by verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence to traditional attitudes.&quot;

The dissent concluded as follows:
==Scholarly commentary==
The Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Romer&quot; did not closely follow established equal protection doctrine (Amendment 2 &quot;defied ... conventional inquiry&quot; wrote Justice Kennedy), and the opinion led to much discussion by scholars and lawyers. One article that received widespread attention was by Akhil Amar, a prominent law professor at Yale. Amar wrote:

Still, Amar asserted that Amendment 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause (although he preferred an alternative argument based on the Attainder Clause). Regarding the Equal Protection Clause, Amar wrote:

Putting aside the odds of discrimination against heterosexuals, Amar suggested that even if Amendment 2 had barred special protection for both heterosexuals and homosexuals, that still would have been unconstitutional because it would single out groups by name for harm, just like a law that says &quot;Akhil Reed Amar shall be ineligible for a private immigration bill or a suspension of deportation&quot;.

The &quot;one-way ratchet&quot; mentioned by Amar has been discussed by other authors as well. For example, law professor John Calvin Jeffries has argued that the Court in &quot;Romer&quot; was actually relying upon a principle of non-retrogression, whereby &quot;The Constitution becomes a ratchet, allowing change in one direction only.&quot; Jeffries and his co-author, Daryl Levinson, conclude: &quot;the revival of non-retrogression as a constitutional principle is symptomatic of a Supreme Court adrift in an age of judicial activism.&quot;

Supporters of the decision, such as law professor Louis Michael Seidman, celebrated its &quot;radical&quot; nature, and hailed it as a revival of the Warren Court&#x27;s activism. According to law professor Evan Gerstmann, the Court in &quot;Romer&quot; left unmentioned and unconsidered many purposes of Amendment 2 that the Colorado courts had acknowledged as legitimate. &quot;[T]here are no standards at all to restrict the [US Supreme] Court&#x27;s discretion. ... But there are important reasons to be concerned about the Court&#x27;s sloppy reasoning in &quot;Romer.&quot; While the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision was widely viewed as a victory for gay and lesbian rights, it is a victory that is narrow and perhaps Pyrrhic. While &quot;Romer&quot; is something of a breakthrough for gays and lesbians, the case really represents a change in sentiment rather than a change in law. Gays and lesbians are still at the bottom of the equal protection hierarchy.&quot; The case, says Gerstmann, &quot;has left the law of equal protection even murkier than before. ... This is not equal protection of the laws. It is the very opposite of equal protection. It is a loose conglomeration of stated legal principles that are, in fact, ignored, and unstated de facto rules that allow courts to apply different standards to different groups at different times based on judicial sentiment rather than judicial reason. The courts can do better than this.&quot;

==Related cases and events==
In 1993, Cincinnati, Ohio, passed Ballot Issue 3, an amendment to the city charter, which forbade the city from adopting or enforcing civil rights ordinances based on sexual orientation, the only municipality in the United States to pass such a restriction. The wording of Cincinnati&#x27;s amendment was almost identical to that of Colorado&#x27;s. The amendment was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1996. Later, the case was remanded by the Supreme Court for further consideration in 1997 in the wake of the &quot;Romer&quot; decision. The Sixth Circuit upheld the amendment a second time, differentiating it from the state-level amendment on the grounds that it was a local government action of the type that Amendment 2 was designed to preempt. On October 13, 1998, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal, allowing the Sixth Circuit decision and the city amendment to stand. In 2005, Cincinnati voters overturned the amendment.

Since &quot;Romer&quot; stood in obvious tension with the Court&#x27;s earlier decision in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, it laid the groundwork for 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which overturned &quot;Bowers&quot;; like the &quot;Romer&quot; case, Justices Kennedy and Scalia would author the majority and dissenting opinions in &quot;Lawrence&quot; with all nine justices voting almost the same way as in &quot;Romer&quot; (Justice O&#x27;Connor concurred, but with a different rationale). &quot;Romer&quot; has been narrowly cited but influential within its niche, being cited in the cases of &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; and &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;, but the case has not had a much broader impact given the Court&#x27;s assertion that it was conducting neither a &quot;normal process of judicial review&quot; nor a &quot;conventional inquiry&quot;. In the same niche, &quot;Romer&quot; was cited in the decision of Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;, wherein the Department&#x27;s desire to deny marriage licences to same-sex couples was explicitly likened to Amendment 2&#x27;s attempt to broadly restrict from seeking benefits a narrowly defined class of citizens.

In 2007, fifteen years after the referendum on Amendment 2, the Colorado legislature amended its anti-discrimination law by forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. In 2008, Colorado further expanded its LGBT protections to include housing, public accommodation, and advertising.

Future Chief Justice John Roberts donated time pro bono to prepare oral arguments for the plaintiffs. Speaking during his nomination process, a case leader, Walter A. Smith Jr., praised his work on the case, recalling, &quot;He said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do it.&#x27; And it&#x27;s illustrative of his open-mindedness, his fair-mindedness. He did a brilliant job.&quot;

<text>George Gordon Meade (December 31, 1815 – November 6, 1872) was a United States Army Major General who commanded the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War from 1863 to 1865. He fought in many of the key battles of the Eastern theater and defeated the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg.

He was born in Cádiz, Spain, to a wealthy Philadelphia merchant family and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1835. He fought in the Second Seminole War and the Mexican–American War. He served in the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and directed construction of lighthouses in Florida and New Jersey from 1851 to 1856 and the United States Lake Survey from 1857 to 1861.

His Civil War service began as brigadier general with the Pennsylvania Reserves, building defenses around Washington D.C. He fought in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Glendale and returned to lead his brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run. As a division commander, he won the Battle of South Mountain and assumed temporary command of the I Corps at the Battle of Antietam. Meade&#x27;s division broke through the lines at the Battle of Fredericksburg but were forced to retreat due to lack of support. Meade was promoted to major general and commander of the V Corps, which he led during the Battle of Chancellorsville.

He was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac just three days before the Battle of Gettysburg and arrived on the battlefield after the first day&#x27;s action on July 1, 1863. He organized his forces on favorable ground to fight an effective defensive battle against Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and repelled a series of massive assaults throughout the next two days. While elated about the victory, President Abraham Lincoln was critical of Meade due to his perception of an ineffective pursuit during the retreat, which allowed Lee and his army to escape back to Virginia. That fall, Meade&#x27;s troops had a minor victory in the Bristoe Campaign but a stalemate at the Battle of Mine Run. Meade&#x27;s cautious approach prompted Lincoln to look for a new commander of the Army of the Potomac.

In 1864–1865, Meade continued to command the Army of the Potomac through the Overland Campaign, the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, and the Appomattox Campaign, but he was overshadowed by the direct supervision of the general-in-chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who accompanied him throughout these campaigns. Grant conducted most of the strategy during these campaigns, leaving Meade with significantly less influence than before. After the war, Meade commanded the Military Division of the Atlantic from 1865 to 1866 and again from 1869 to 1872. He oversaw the formation of the state governments and reentry into the United States for five southern states through his command of the Department of the South from 1866 to 1868 and the Third Military District in 1872. Meade was subjected to intense political rivalries within the Army, notably with Major Gen. Daniel Sickles, who tried to discredit Meade&#x27;s role in the victory at Gettysburg. He had a notoriously short temper which earned him the nickname of &quot;Old Snapping Turtle&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Meade was born on December 31, 1815, in Cádiz, Spain, the eighth of ten children of Richard Worsam Meade and Margaret Coats Butler. His grandfather Irishman George Meade was a wealthy merchant and land speculator in Philadelphia. His father was wealthy due to Spanish-American trade and was appointed U.S. naval agent. He was ruined financially because of his support of Spain in the Peninsular War; his family returned to the United States in 1817, in precarious financial straits.

Meade attended elementary school in Philadelphia and the American Classical and Military Lyceum, a private school in Philadelphia modeled after the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. His father died in 1828 when George was 12 years old and he was taken out of the Germantown military academy. George was placed in a school run by Salmon P. Chase in Washington D.C.; however, it closed after a few months due to Chase&#x27;s other obligations. He was then placed in the Mount Hope Institution in Baltimore, Maryland.

Meade entered the United States Military Academy at West Point on July 1, 1831. He would have preferred to attend college and study law and did not enjoy his time at West Point. He graduated 19th in his class of 56 cadets in 1835. He was uninterested in the details of military dress and drills and accumulated 168 demerits, only 32 short of the amount that would trigger a mandatory dismissal.

==Topographical Corps and Mexican-American War==

Meade was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd Artillery. He worked for a summer as an assistant surveyor on the construction of the Long Island Railroad and was assigned to service in Florida. He fought in the Second Seminole War and was assigned to accompany a group of Seminole to Indian territory in the West. He became a full second lieutenant by year&#x27;s end, and in the fall of 1836, after the minimum required one year of service, he resigned from the army. He returned to Florida and worked as a private citizen for his brother-in-law, James Duncan Graham, as an assistant surveyor to the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers on a railroad project. He conducted additional survey work for the Topographical Engineers on the Texas-Louisiana border, the Mississippi River Delta and the northeastern boundary of Maine and Canada.

In 1842, a congressional measure was passed which excluded civilians from working in the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and Meade reentered the army as a second lieutenant in order to continue his work with them. In November 1843, he was assigned to work on lighthouse construction under Major Hartman Bache. He worked on the Brandywine Shoal lighthouse in the Delaware Bay.

Meade served in the Mexican–American War and was assigned to the staffs of Generals Zachary Taylor and Robert Patterson. He fought at the Battle of Palo Alto, the Battle of Resaca de la Palma and the Battle of Monterrey. He served under General William Worth at Monterrey and led a party up a hill to attack a fortified position. He was brevetted to first lieutenant and received a gold-mounted sword for gallantry from the citizens of Philadelphia.

In 1849, Meade was assigned to Fort Brooke in Florida to assist with Seminole attacks on settlements. In 1851, he led the construction of the Carysfort Reef Light in Key Largo. In 1852, the Topographical Corps established the United States Lighthouse Board and Meade was appointed the Seventh District engineer with responsibilities in Florida. He led the construction of Sand Key Light in Key West; Jupiter Inlet Light in Jupiter, Florida; and Sombrero Key Light in the Florida Keys. When Bache was reassigned to the West Coast, Meade took over responsibility for the Fourth District in New Jersey and Delaware and built the Barnegat Light on Long Beach Island, Absecon Light in Atlantic City, and the Cape May Light in Cape May. He also designed a hydraulic lamp that was used in several American lighthouses. Meade received an official promotion to first lieutenant in 1851, and to captain in 1856.

In 1857, Meade was given command of the Lakes Survey mission of the Great Lakes. Completion of the survey of Lake Huron and extension of the surveys of Lake Michigan down to Grand and Little Traverse Bays were done under his command. Prior to Captain Meade&#x27;s command, Great Lakes&#x27; water level readings were taken locally with temporary gauges; a uniform plane of reference had not been established. In 1858, based on his recommendation, instrumentation was set in place for the tabulation of records across the basin. Meade stayed with the Lakes Survey until the 1861 outbreak of the Civil War.

==American Civil War==
Meade was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on August 31, 1861, a few months after the start of the American Civil War, based on the strong recommendation of Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin. He was assigned command of the 2nd Brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserves under General George A. McCall. The Pennsylvania Reserves were initially assigned to the construction of defenses around Washington, D.C.

===Peninsula campaign===

In March 1862, the Army of the Potomac was reorganized into four corps, Meade served as part of the I Corps under Maj. Gen Irvin McDowell. The I Corps was stationed in the Rappahannock area, but in June, the Pennsylvania Reserves were detached and sent to the Peninsula to reinforce the main army. With the onset of the Seven Days Battles on June 25, the Reserves were directly involved in the fighting. At Mechanicsville and Gaines Mill, Meade&#x27;s brigade was mostly held in reserve, but at Glendale on June 30, the brigade was in the middle of a fierce battle. His brigade lost 1,400 men and Meade was shot in the right arm and through the back. He was sent home to Philadelphia to recuperate. Meade resumed command of his brigade in time for the Second Battle of Bull Run, then assigned to Major General Irvin McDowell&#x27;s corps of the Army of Virginia. His brigade made a heroic stand on Henry House Hill to protect the rear of the retreating Union Army.

===Maryland campaign===

The division&#x27;s commander John F. Reynolds was sent to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to train militia units and Meade assumed temporary division command at the Battle of South Mountain and the Battle of Antietam. Under Meade&#x27;s command, the division successfully attacked and captured a strategic position on high ground near Turner&#x27;s Gap held by Robert E. Rodes&#x27; troops which forced the withdrawal of other Confederate troops. When Meade&#x27;s troops stormed the heights, the corps commander Joseph Hooker, exclaimed, &quot;Look at Meade! Why, with troops like those, led in that way, I can win anything!&quot;

On September 17, 1862, at Antietam, Meade assumed temporary command of the I Corps and oversaw fierce combat after Hooker was wounded and requested Meade replace him. On September 29, 1862, Reynolds returned from his service in Harrisburg. Reynolds assumed command of the I Corps and Meade assumed command of the Third Division.

===Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville===

On November 5, 1862, Ambrose Burnside replaced McClellan as commander of the Army of the Potomac. Burnside gave command of the I Corps to Reynolds which frustrated Meade as he had more combat experience than Reynolds.

Meade was promoted to major general of the Pennsylvania Reserves on November 29, 1862, and given command of a division in the &quot;Left Grand Division&quot; under William B. Franklin. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, Meade&#x27;s division made the only breakthrough of the Confederate lines, spearheading through a gap in Lt. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s corps at the southern end of the battlefield. However, his attack was not reinforced, which resulted in the loss of much of his division. He led the Center Grand Division through the Mud March and stationed his troops on the banks of the Rappahanock.

On December 22, 1862, Meade replaced Daniel Butterfield in command of the V Corps which he led in the Battle of Chancellorsville. On January 26, 1863, Joseph Hooker assumed command of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker had grand plans for the Battle of Chancellorsville, but was unsuccessful in execution, allowing the Confederates to seize the initiative. After the battle, Meade wrote to his wife that, &quot;General Hooker has disappointed all his friends by failing to show his fighting qualities in a pinch.&quot;

Meade&#x27;s corps was left in reserve for most of the battle, contributing to the Union defeat. Meade was among Hooker&#x27;s commanders who argued to advance against Lee, but Hooker chose to retreat. Meade learned afterward that Hooker misrepresented his position on the advance and confronted him. All of Hooker&#x27;s commanders supported Meade&#x27;s position except Dan Sickles.

===Gettysburg campaign===
In June 1863, Lee took the initiative and moved his Army of Northern Virginia into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Hooker responded rapidly and positioned the Army of the Potomac between Lee&#x27;s army and Washington D.C. However, the relationship between the Lincoln administration and Hooker had deteriorated due to Hooker&#x27;s poor performance at Chancellorsville. Hooker requested additional troops be assigned from Harper&#x27;s Ferry to assist in the pursuit of Lee in the Gettysburg Campaign. When Lincoln and General in Chief Henry Halleck refused, Hooker resigned in protest.

====Command of the Army of the Potomac====
In the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger from President Abraham Lincoln arrived to inform Meade of his appointment as Hooker&#x27;s replacement. Upon being woken up, he&#x27;d assumed that army politics had caught up to him and that he was under arrest, only to find that he&#x27;d been given leadership of the Army of the Potomac. 

He had not actively sought command and was not the president&#x27;s first choice. John F. Reynolds, one of four major generals who outranked Meade in the Army of the Potomac, had earlier turned down the president&#x27;s suggestion that he take over. Three corps commanders, John Sedgwick, Henry Slocum, and Darius N. Couch, recommended Meade for command of the army and agreed to serve under him despite outranking him. While his colleagues were excited for the change in leadership, the soldiers in the Army of Potomac were uncertain of Meade since his modesty, lack of the theatrical and scholarly demeanor did not match their expectations for a General.

Meade assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on June 28, 1863. In a letter to his wife, Meade wrote that command of the army was &quot;more likely to destroy one&#x27;s reputation then to add to it.&quot;

====Battle of Gettysburg====
Meade rushed the remainder of his army to Gettysburg and deployed his forces for a defensive battle. Meade was only four days into his leadership of the Army of the Potomac and informed his corps commanders that he would provide quick decisions and entrust them with the authority to carry out those orders the best way they saw fit. He also made it clear that he was counting on the corps commanders to provide him with sound advice on strategy.

Since Meade was new to high command, he did not remain in headquarters but constantly moved about the battlefield, issuing orders and ensuring that they were followed. Meade gave orders for the Army of the Potomac to move forward in a broad front to prevent Lee from flanking them and threatening the cities of Baltimore and Washington D.C. He also issued a conditional plan for a retreat to Pipe Creek, Maryland in case things went poorly for the Union. By 6 pm on the evening of July 1, 1863, Meade sent a telegram to Washington informing them of his decision to concentrate forces and make a stand at Gettysburg.

On July 2, 1863, Meade continued to monitor and maintain the placement of the troops. He was outraged when he discovered that Daniel Sickles had moved his Corps one mile forward to high ground without Meade&#x27;s permission and left a gap in the line which threatened Sickles&#x27; right flank. Meade recognized that Little Round Top was critical to maintaining the left flank. He sent chief engineer Gouverneur Warren to determine the status of the hill and quickly issued orders for the V Corps to occupy it when it was discovered empty. Meade continued to reinforce the troops defending Little Round Top from Longstreet&#x27;s advance and suffered the near destruction of thirteen brigades. One questionable decision Meade made that day was to order Slocum&#x27;s XII Corps to move from Culp&#x27;s Hill to the left flank which allowed Confederate troops to temporarily capture a portion of it.

On the evening of July 2, 1863, Meade called a &quot;council of war&quot; consisting of his top generals. The council reviewed the battle to date and agreed to keep fighting in a defensive position.
On July 3, 1863, Meade gave orders for the XII Corps and XI Corps to retake the lost portion of Culp&#x27;s Hill and personally rode the length of the lines from Cemetery Ridge to Little Round Top to inspect the troops. His headquarters were in the Leister House directly behind Cemetery Ridge which exposed it to the 150-gun cannonade which began at 1 pm. The house came under direct fire from incorrectly targeted Confederate guns; Butterfield was wounded and sixteen horses tied up in front of the house were killed. Meade did not want to vacate the headquarters and make it more difficult for messages to find him, but the situation became too dire and the house was evacuated.

During the three days, Meade made excellent use of capable subordinates, such as Maj. Gens. John F. Reynolds and Winfield S. Hancock, to whom he delegated great responsibilities. He reacted swiftly to fierce assaults on his line&#x27;s left and right which culminated in Lee&#x27;s disastrous assault on the center, known as Pickett&#x27;s Charge.

By the end of three days of fighting, the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s 60,000 troops and 30,000 horses had not been fed in three days and were weary from fighting. On the evening of July 4, 1863, Meade held a second council of war with his top generals, minus Hancock and Gibbon, who were absent due to duty and injury. The council reviewed the status of the army and debated staying in place at Gettysburg versus chasing the retreating Army of Northern Virginia. The council voted to remain in place for one day to allow for rest and recovery and then set out after Lee&#x27;s army. Meade sent a message to Halleck stating, &quot;I make a reconnaissance to-morrow, to ascertain what the intention of the enemy is … should the enemy retreat, I shall pursue him on his flanks.&quot;

====Lee&#x27;s retreat====
On July 4, it was observed that the Confederate Army was forming a new line near the nearby mountains after pulling back their left flank, but by July 5 it was clear that they were making a retreat, leaving Meade and his men to tend to the wounded and fallen soldiers until July 6, when Meade ordered his men to Maryland.

Meade was criticized by President Lincoln and others for not aggressively pursuing the Confederates during their retreat. Meade&#x27;s perceived caution stemmed from three causes: casualties and exhaustion of the Army of the Potomac which had engaged in forced marches and heavy fighting for a week, heavy general officer casualties that impeded effective command and control, and a desire to guard a hard-won victory against a sudden reversal. Halleck informed Meade of the president&#x27;s dissatisfaction which infuriated Meade that politicians and non-field-based officers were telling him how to fight the war. He wrote back and offered to resign his command, but Halleck refused the resignation and clarified that his communication was not meant as a rebuke but an incentive to continue the pursuit of Lee&#x27;s army.

At one point, the Army of Northern Virginia was trapped with its back to the rain-swollen, almost impassable Potomac River; however, the Army of Northern Virginia was able to erect strong defensive positions before Meade, whose army had also been weakened by the fighting, could organize an effective attack. Lee knew he had the superior defensive position and hoped that Meade would attack and the resulting Union Army losses would dampen the victory at Gettysburg. By July 14, 1863, Lee&#x27;s troops built a temporary bridge over the river and retreated into Virginia.

Meade was rewarded for his actions at Gettysburg by a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army on July 7, 1863, and the Thanks of Congress, which commended Meade &quot;... and the officers and soldiers of the Army of the Potomac, for the skill and heroic valor which at Gettysburg repulsed, defeated, and drove back, broken and dispirited, beyond the Rappahannock, the veteran army of the rebellion.&quot;

Meade wrote the following to his wife after meeting President Lincoln:
===Bristoe and Mine Run campaign===

During the fall of 1863, the Army of the Potomac was weakened by the transfer of the XI and XII Corps to the Western Theater. Meade felt pressure from Halleck and the Lincoln administration to pursue Lee into Virginia but he was cautious due to a misperception that Lee&#x27;s Army was 70,000 in size when the reality was they were only 55,000 compared to the Army of the Potomac at 76,000. Many of the Union troop replacements for the losses suffered at Gettysburg were new recruits and it was uncertain how they would perform in combat.

Lee petitioned Jefferson Davis to allow him to take the offensive against the cautious Meade which would also prevent further Union troops being sent to the Western Theater to support William Rosencrans at the Battle of Chickamauga.
The Army of the Potomac was stationed along the north bank of the Rapidan River and Meade made his headquarters in Culpeper, Virginia. In the Bristoe Campaign, Lee attempted to flank the Army of the Potomac and force Meade to move north of the Rappahannock River. The Union forces had deciphered the Confederate semaphore code. This along with spies and scouts gave Meade advance notice of Lee&#x27;s movements. As Lee&#x27;s troops moved north to the west of the Army of the Potomac, Meade abandoned his headquarters at Culpeper and gave orders for his troops to move north to intercept Lee. Meade successfully outmaneuvered Lee in the campaign and gained a small victory. Lee reported that his plans failed due to the quickness of Meade&#x27;s redeployment of resources. However, Meade&#x27;s inability to stop Lee from approaching the outskirts of Washington prompted Lincoln to look for another commander of the Army of the Potomac.

In late November 1863, Meade planned one last offensive against Lee before winter weather limited troop movement. In the Mine Run Campaign, Meade attempted to attack the right flank of the Army of Northern Virginia south of the Rapidan River but the maneuver failed due to the poor performance of William H. French. There was heavy skirmishing but a full attack never occurred. Meade determined that the Confederate forces were too strong and was convinced by Warren that an attack would have been suicidal. Meade held a council of war which concluded to withdraw across the Rapidan River during the night of December 1, 1863.

===Overland campaign===
1864 was an election year and Lincoln understood that the fate of his reelection lay in the Union Army success against the Confederates. Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, fresh off his success in the Western Theater, was appointed commander of all Union armies in March 1864. In his meeting with Lincoln, Grant was told he could select who he wanted to lead the Army of the Potomac. Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War told Grant, &quot;You will find a very weak, irresolute man there and my advice to you is to replace him at once.&quot;

Meade offered to resign and stated the task at hand was of such importance that he would not stand in the way of Grant choosing the right man for the job and offered to serve wherever placed. Grant assured Meade he had no intentions of replacing him. Grant later wrote that this incident gave him a more favorable opinion of Meade than the great victory at Gettysburg. Grant knew that Meade disapproved of Lincoln&#x27;s strategy and was unpopular with politicians and the press. Grant was not willing to allow him free command of the Army of the Potomac without direct supervision.

Grant&#x27;s orders to Meade before the Overland Campaign were direct and the point. He stated &quot;Lee&#x27;s army will be your objective point. Wherever Lee goes, there you will go also.&quot; On May 4, 1864, the Army of the Potomac left its winter encampment and crossed the Rapidan River. Meade and Grant both believed that Lee would retreat to the North Anna River or to Mine Run. Lee had received intelligence about the movements of the Army of the Potomac and countered with a move to the East and met the Union Army at the Wilderness. Meade ordered Warren to attack with his whole Corps and had Hancock reinforce with his II Corps. Meade ordered additional Union troops to join the battle but they struggled to maintain formation and communicate with each other in the thick woods of the Wilderness. After three days of brutal fighting and the loss of 17,000 men, the Union Army called it a draw and Meade and Grant moved with their forces south toward Spotsylvania Court House to place the Union Army between Lee&#x27;s forces and Richmond in the hopes of drawing them out to open field combat.
The Union Army moved ponderously slowly toward their new positions and Meade lashed out at Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan and his cavalry corps blaming them for not clearing the road and not informing Meade of the enemy&#x27;s movements. Grant had brought Sheridan with him from the Western Theater and he found the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s cavalry corps run down and in poor discipline. Meade and Sheridan clashed over the use of cavalry since the Army of the Potomac had historically used cavalry as couriers, scouting and headquarters guards. Sheridan told Meade that he could &quot;whip Stuart&quot; if Meade let him. Meade reported the conversation to Grant thinking he would reprimand the insubordinate Sheridan, but he replied, &quot;Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it.&quot; Meade deferred to Grant&#x27;s judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to &quot;proceed against the enemy&#x27;s cavalry&quot; and from May 9 through May 24, sent him on a raid toward Richmond, directly challenging the Confederate cavalry. Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry had great success, they broke up the Confederate supply lines, liberated hundreds of Union prisoners, mortally wounded Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart and threatened the city of Richmond. However, his departure left the Union Army blind to enemy movements.

Grant made his headquarters with Meade for the remainder of the war, which caused Meade to chafe at the close supervision he received. A newspaper reported the Army of the Potomac was, &quot;directed by Grant, commanded by Meade, and led by Hancock, Sedgwick and Warren.&quot; Following an incident in June 1864, in which Meade disciplined reporter Edward Cropsey from &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; newspaper for an unfavorable article, all of the press assigned to his army agreed to mention Meade only in conjunction with setbacks. Meade apparently knew nothing of this arrangement, and the reporters giving all of the credit to Grant angered Meade.

Additional differences caused further friction between Grant and Meade. Waging a war of attrition in the Overland Campaign against Lee, Grant was willing to suffer previously unacceptable losses with the knowledge that the Union Army had replacement soldiers available, whereas the Confederates did not. Meade was opposed to Grant&#x27;s recommendations to directly attack fortified Confederate positions which resulted in huge losses of Union soldiers. Grant became frustrated with Meade&#x27;s cautious approach and despite his initial promise to allow Meade latitude in his command, Grant began to override Meade and order the tactical deployment of the Army of the Potomac.

Meade became frustrated with his lack of autonomy and his performance as a military leader suffered. During the Battle of Cold Harbor, Meade inadequately coordinated the disastrous frontal assault. However, Meade took some satisfaction that Grant&#x27;s overconfidence at the start of the campaign against Lee had been reduced after the brutal confrontation of the Overland Campaign and stated, &quot;I think Grant has had his eyes opened, and is willing to admit now that Virginia and Lee&#x27;s army is not Tennessee and [Braxton] Bragg&#x27;s army.&quot;

After the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Grant requested that Meade be promoted to major general of the regular army. In a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton on May 13, 1864, Grant stated that &quot;Meade has more than met my most sanguine expectations. He and [William T.] Sherman are the fittest officers for large commands I have come in contact with.&quot; Meade felt slighted that his promotion was processed after that of Sherman and Sheridan, the latter his subordinate. The U.S. Senate confirmed Sherman and Sheridan on January 13, 1865, Meade on February 1. Subsequently, Sheridan was promoted to lieutenant general over Meade on March 4, 1869, after Grant became president and Sherman became the commanding general of the U.S. Army. However, his date of rank meant that he was outranked at the end of the war only by Grant, Halleck, and Sherman.

===Richmond-Petersburg campaign===
Meade and the Army of the Potomac crossed the James River to attack the strategic supply route centered on Petersburg, Virginia. They probed the defenses of the city and Meade wrote, &quot;We find the enemy, as usual, in a very strong position, defended by earthworks, and it looks very much as if we will have to go through a siege of Petersburg before entering on a siege of Richmond.&quot;

An opportunity opened up to lead the Army of the Shenandoah, to protect Washington D.C. against the raids of Jubal Early. Meade wanted the role to free himself from under Grant; however, the position was given to Sheridan. When Meade asked Grant why it did not go to himself, the more experienced officer, Grant stated that Lincoln did not want to take Meade away from the Army of the Potomac and imply that his leadership was substandard.

During the Siege of Petersburg, he approved the plan of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside to plant explosives in a mine shaft dug underneath the Confederate line east of Petersburg, but at the last minute he changed Burnside&#x27;s plan to lead the attack with a well-trained African-American division that was highly drilled just for this action, instructing him to take a politically less risky course and substitute an untrained and poorly led white division. The resulting Battle of the Crater was one of the great fiascoes of the war.
Although he fought during the Appomattox Campaign, Grant and Sheridan received most of the credit and Meade was not present when Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House.

With the war over, the Army of the Potomac was disbanded on June 28, 1865, and Meade&#x27;s command of it ended.

===Political rivalries===
Many of the political rivalries in the Army of the Potomac stemmed from opposition to the politically conservative, full-time officers from West Point. Meade was a Douglas Democrat and saw the preservation of the Union as the war&#x27;s true goal and only opposed slavery as it threatened to tear the Union apart. He was a supporter of McClellan, the previously removed commander of the Army of the Potomac, and was politically aligned with him. Other McClellan loyalists who advocated a more moderate prosecution of the war, such as Charles P. Stone and Fitz John Porter, were arrested and court-martialed. When Meade was awakened in the middle of the night and informed that he was given command of the Army of the Potomac, he later wrote to his wife that he assumed that Army politics had caught up with him and he was being arrested.

Meade&#x27;s short temper earned him notoriety, and while he was respected by most of his peers and trusted by the men in his army, he did not inspire them. While Meade could be sociable, intellectual and courteous in normal times, the stress of war made him prickly and abrasive and earned him the nickname &quot;Old Snapping Turtle&quot;. He was prone to bouts of anger and rashness and was paranoid about political enemies coming after him.

His political enemies included Daniel Butterfield, Abner Doubleday, Joseph Hooker, Alfred Pleasonton and Daniel Sickles. Sickles had developed a personal vendetta against Meade because of Sickles&#x27;s allegiance to Hooker, whom Meade had replaced, and because of controversial disagreements at Gettysburg. Sickles had either mistakenly or deliberately disregarded Meade&#x27;s orders about placing his III Corps in the defensive line, which led to that corps&#x27; destruction and placed the entire army at risk on the second day of battle.

Halleck, Meade&#x27;s direct supervisor prior to Grant, was openly critical of Meade. Both Halleck and Lincoln pressured Meade to destroy Lee&#x27;s army but gave no specifics as to how it should be done. Radical Republicans, some of whom like Thaddeus Stevens were former Know Nothings and hostile to Irish Catholics like Meade&#x27;s family, in the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and tried in vain to relieve him from command. Sickles testified to the committee that Meade wanted to retreat his position at Gettysburg before the fighting started. The joint committee did not remove Meade from command of the Army of the Potomac.

==Reconstruction==
In July 1865, Meade assumed command of the Military Division of the Atlantic headquartered in Philadelphia. On January 6, 1868, he took command of the Third Military District in Atlanta. In January 1868, he assumed command of the Department of the South. The formation of the state governments of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina for reentry into the United States was completed under his direct supervision. When the Governor of Georgia refused to accept the Reconstruction Acts of Congress, Meade replaced him with General Thomas H. Ruger.

After the Camilla massacre in September 1868, caused by anger from white southerners over blacks gaining the right to vote in the 1868 Georgia state constitution, Meade investigated the event and decided to leave the punishment in the hands of civil authorities. Meade returned to command of the Military Division of the Atlantic in Philadelphia.

In 1869, following Grant&#x27;s inauguration as president and William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s assignment to general-in-chief, Sheridan was promoted over Meade to lieutenant general. Meade effectively served in semi-retirement as the commander of the Military Division of the Atlantic from his home in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
On December 31, 1840 (his birthday), he married Margaretta Sergeant, daughter of John Sergeant, running mate of Henry Clay in the 1832 presidential election. They had seven children together: John Sergeant Meade, George Meade, Margaret Butler Meade, Spencer Meade, Sarah Wise Meade, Henrietta Meade, and William Meade.

His notable descendants include:
*George Meade Easby, great-grandson
*Happy Rockefeller, great-great-granddaughter
*Matthew Fox, great-great-great-grandson

==Later life and death==

Meade was presented with a gold medal from the Union League of Philadelphia in recognition for his success at Gettysburg.

Meade was a commissioner of Fairmount Park in Philadelphia from 1866 until his death. The city of Philadelphia gave Meade&#x27;s wife a house at 1836 Delancey Place in which he lived also. The building still has the name &quot;Meade&quot; over the door, but is now used as apartments.

Meade received an honorary doctorate in law (LL.D.) from Harvard University, and his scientific achievements were recognized by various institutions, including the American Philosophical Society and the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.

Having long suffered from complications caused by his war wounds, Meade died on November 6, 1872, in the house at 1836 Delancey Place, from pneumonia. He was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Meade has been memorialized with several statues including an equestrian statue at Gettysburg National Military Park by Henry Kirke Bush-Brown; the George Gordon Meade Memorial statue by Charles Grafly, in front of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, D.C.; an equestrian statue by Alexander Milne Calder; and one by Daniel Chester French atop the Smith Memorial Arch, both in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. A bronze bust of Meade by Boris Blai was placed at Barnegat Lighthouse in 1957.

The United States Army&#x27;s Fort George G. Meade in Fort Meade, Maryland, is named for him, as are Meade County, Kansas; Fort Meade, Florida; Fort Meade National Cemetery; and Meade County, South Dakota. The Grand Army of the Republic Meade Post #1 founded in Philadelphia in 1866 was named in his honor.

The General Meade Society was created to &quot;promote and preserve the memory of Union Major General George Meade&quot;. Members gather in Laurel Hill Cemetery on December 31 to recognize his birthday. The Old Baldy Civil War Round Table in Philadelphia is named in honor of Meade&#x27;s horse during the war. 

The one-thousand-dollar Treasury Notes, also called Coin notes, of the Series 1890 and 1891, feature portraits of Meade on the obverse. The 1890 Series note is called the Grand Watermelon Note by collectors, because the large zeroes on the reverse resemble the pattern on a watermelon.

The preserved head of Old Baldy, Meade&#x27;s wartime horse, was donated to the Civil War Museum of Philadelphia by the Grand Army of the Republic Museum in 1979.

<text>The Proud Family is an American animated television series created by Bruce W. Smith that aired on Disney Channel for two seasons from September 15, 2001, to August 19, 2005. The series centers on the life of the titular family, including the show’s main protagonist, Penny Proud, a 14-year-old African American teenage girl who navigates her adolescence while dealing with her friends and family. Episodes deal with Penny discovering her boundaries and struggling with family relationships and peer pressure. Penny Proud has strong relationships with her entrepreneurial father Oscar Proud and her veterinarian mother Trudy Proud, as well as her friends Dijonay Jones, LaCienega Boulevardez, Zoey Howzer, and Sticky Webb.

Bruce W. Smith previously directed the film, &quot;Bebe&#x27;s Kids&quot;, which was a box office failure. Because of the lack of African-American animated shows, Smith co-founded Jambalaya Studios to create diverse projects. &quot;The Proud Family&quot; is the first project to be created from the company, starting development in 1998. Smith was inspired to create the series due to the lack of African-American empowerment in animation. Based on his experiences with a middle-class African-American family in Los Angeles, the series featured several elements in animated sitcoms that explored socially relevant themes.

&quot;The Proud Family&quot; is the first animated series to air exclusively on Disney Channel. The series premiered on September 15, 2001, as part of the network&#x27;s programming block Zoog Disney. The series received generally positive reviews for its humor and themes, but received some criticism for its stereotypes. A feature film, &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot;, premiered as the series finale on August 19, 2005. A revival, known as &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot;, premiered on February 23, 2022, on Disney+ .

==Characters==
===Main===


* Penny Proud (voiced by Kyla Pratt) is the main protagonist of the series, a good-natured, smart, outspoken, and sensible 14-year-old girl who enjoys hanging out with her friends, even though they (mostly Dijonay) have gotten her into trouble, and left her to face danger by herself many times. She loves her parents dearly, but has a rather tense relationship with Oscar as he frequently embarasses her and clashes with him over matters of the heart, especially when dating boys.
* Oscar Proud (voiced by Tommy Davidson) is the overprotective father of Penny, BeBe and CeCe, husband of Trudy, younger brother of Bobby Proud and son of Suga Mama. Oscar is characterized as obnoxious and immature, but still a well-meaning, friendly man whose ambitions and failed attempts at fame and fortune often cloud his judgement. Oscar is an amateur entrepreneur despite his job as a telemarketer for the fictional Kelly Inc. entrepreneurship.
* Trudy Proud (née Parker) (voiced by Paula Jai Parker) is the veterinarian mother of Penny, BeBe and CeCe, wife of Oscar, daughter-in-law of Suga Mama and sister-in-law of Bobby Proud. She comes from a relatively wealthy family which includes her sister Diana, who is a famous actress. She often gives Penny advice when Penny is in trouble while at the same time, she frequently forces Oscar to see the logical side of an argument and to allow Penny to have a voice. Trudy is the second most sensible member of the family along with Penny, though she can be bossy sometimes.
* Suga Mama Proud (voiced by Jo Marie Payton) is Penny, BeBe, and CeCe&#x27;s hip, wrestling-loving paternal grandmother, Oscar and Bobby&#x27;s mother and Trudy&#x27;s mother-in-law who does Tae Bo. She is nice but sassy, and always gets straight to the point when she talks. She can even tease and beat up Oscar, but loves him deep down. She is really into pink dresses and afro puffs, hence the name of her dog, Puff.
* BeBe Proud &amp; CeCe Proud (both voiced by Tara Strong) are Penny&#x27;s troublemaking baby fraternal twin siblings. BeBe is a boy with an afro and always has a bottle in his mouth, while CeCe is a girl with brown hair and a pink dress. BeBe and CeCe are named after the gospel music brother and sister duo, BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans.
* Puff the Dog (voiced by Tara Strong in the first season, Carlos Alazraqui in the second season and the movie) is Suga Mama&#x27;s beloved pet poodle. Puff is often tormented by the baby twins, BeBe &amp; CeCe, who play roughly with him. He does, however, show a soft side for Penny.
* LaCienega Boulevardez (voiced by Alisa Reyes) is Penny&#x27;s Hispanic-American frenemy and the daughter of Felix and Sunset Boulevardez. She is the most popular and beautiful girl in Penny&#x27;s school, caring a great deal about her popularity and image and displaying a rather nasty attitude and taking pleasure in bullying, hence why Penny in particular does not get along with her, but they have gotten along on a few occasions. LaCienega and her mother Sunset are named after La Cienega Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard, two Los Angeles area arterial roads that meet in West Hollywood, California.
* Dijonay Jones (voiced by Karen Malina White) is Penny&#x27;s selfish and untrustworthy yet enthusiastic and caring best friend. She has an obsessive crush on Sticky. She also loves to gossip and has gotten Penny in trouble many times. Dijonay&#x27;s name is a pun on the name of Best Foods&#x27;/Hellmann&#x27;s Dijonnaise, and she has nine younger siblings, all named after spices, seasonings and condiments.
* Zoey Howzer (voiced by Soleil Moon Frye) is timid, shy, and very insecure about her looks and wants to be accepted. Zoey is known for being a follower and Penny often has to talk sense into her. Her family is Jewish.
* Sticky Webb (voiced by Orlando Brown) is Penny&#x27;s other best friend. He is shown as a cool tech nerd who is able to build or hack any type of device, and after Zoey, he is Penny&#x27;s most loyal friend. He is only seen as a silent cameo in the first episode of the spin-off &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot; as his voice actor, Orlando Brown, would not return to reprise his role for the character, causing Sticky to be written off completely, with Sticky&#x27;s family moving to Japan.

===Supporting===

* The Gross Sisters (Nubia is voiced by Raquel Lee, Olei and Gina don&#x27;t speak) are the neighborhood bullies who are almost always seen together and who go around stealing money from students, faculty, and even parents (including their own). Their names are references to skincare brands Neutrogena, Nivea, and Olay, although their skin is noted to be dry, ashy, and blue.
* Bobby Proud (voiced by Cedric the Entertainer, Arsenio Hall in the movie) is Oscar&#x27;s older brother, Suga Mama&#x27;s elder son, Trudy&#x27;s brother-in-law and Penny, BeBe and CeCe&#x27;s uncle. He is a fan of groups like Kool &amp; The Gang among others. Suga Mama favors him over Oscar. He often has Oscar do things that annoy him very often, but ironically lead to Oscar meeting beautiful women.
* Wizard Kelly (voiced by Aries Spears) is an incredibly wealthy and famous businessman who made his fortune playing professional basketball, whom Oscar greatly admires. He owns various businesses that are named after him, one of which is the Kelly Inc. entrepeneurship where Oscar works. A running gag is that he is very tall, so every image and video of him shows only up to his neck. He is based on former basketball player Magic Johnson, following a similar life and nomenclature. His wife&#x27;s name, Ginger Snap, is a play on Johnson&#x27;s wife Cookie.
* Smart Baby/Red-Nosed Baby (voiced by Ron Glass) is an infant with a droll expression, who enjoys harassing Oscar.
* Felix Boulevardez (voiced by Carlos Mencia) is Oscar&#x27;s neighbor and best friend. He is the father of LaCienega and the husband of Sunset. He owns his own construction company called Boulevardez Construction. Both Oscar and Felix tend to get in trouble with their wives although he is noticeably more well-off and successful than Oscar is, yet their friendship is strong. Felix usually gives LaCienega everything she asks for but he has occasionally been pushed to a breaking point.
* Sunset Boulevardez (voiced by Maria Canals) is Felix&#x27;s wife and Trudy&#x27;s best friend. She is the mother of LaCienega, a stay-at-home mother who has a lot in common with Trudy, such as complaining about how their husbands get in trouble quite frequently. Unlike Felix, Sunset is more strict with LaCienega as she has little patience for her nasty attitude. She is also very fond of Penny, much to LaCienega&#x27;s chagrin.
* Papi Boulevardez (voiced by Alvaro Gutierrez, Kevin Michael Richardson while laughing) is Felix&#x27;s father, Sunset&#x27;s father-in-law and Suga Mama&#x27;s love interest. He is the grandfather of LaCienega. He speaks only Spanish and as a result he can get away with insulting Suga Mama. He is known for his trademark cackling when after he insults Suga Mama or on some occasions.
* Michael Collins (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is Penny&#x27;s flamboyant friend and the son of the school coach.
* Dr. Payne (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is the Prouds&#x27; doctor, whose build and mannerisms are based on those of Mr. T. Oscar usually suffers painful treatment at his hands.
* Peabo (voiced by Cree Summer) is the Prouds&#x27; 9-year-old neighbor.
* Li’l Wiz (voiced by Aries Spears) is Wizard Kelly&#x27;s son.

==Episodes==

==Production==
=== Origin and development ===

American animator and character designer Bruce W. Smith had previously directed the animated film &quot;Bebe&#x27;s Kids&quot;. Based on comedian Robin Harris&#x27; stand-up comedy act of the same name, it was the first animated film to be targeted at a Black audience. Released on July 31, 1992, by Paramount Pictures, it was a box-office flop, and it received negative reviews from critics. Since the 1970s, only a few animated series had an African-American focus, including &quot;Little Bill&quot; in 1999.

In 1999, Smith co-founded Jambalaya Studios with Hyperion Pictures to bring more &quot;racially and ethnically&quot; diverse animated projects to television, movies, and the internet. &quot;The Proud Family&quot; was the first project created for the company. The series started development in 1998. Smith was inspired to create the series because he did not see the characters of color represented in animation. Upon creating the series, Smith drew his experiences with a middle-class African-American family in Los Angeles. The conception of the series was also inspired by his fatherhood of three children. In 2000, Smith told Charles Solomon of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; that he wanted to create a middle-class African-American family that was &quot;not so much Cosby-esque as Cosby-esque with a really interesting slant.&quot; The name of the series was inspired by his meeting with co-founder Tom Wilhite when Smith showed him the main characters drawn in a family portrait.

The series&#x27; lead character, Penny Proud, was partially based on Smith&#x27;s daughter Rachel. According to Smith in 2001, he saw the series as an instructional video to his daughter. Oscar&#x27;s mother, Suga Mama, was named after Smith&#x27;s mother, Mary, who disliked being called &quot;grandma&quot;. His mother&#x27;s personality traits were also included for the character, including her &quot;bold spirit&quot;. Oscar and Trudy Proud were based on Smith and his wife Denise. Papi Boulevardez&#x27;s physical appearance was inspired by Cesar Romero as the Joker in &quot;Batman&quot; (1966).

=== Casting ===
Kyla Pratt was cast as the lead character Penny Proud. At the time, Pratt identified with her character&#x27;s personality traits because they both &quot;[knew] when to be sweet and when to have a little attitude&quot;, and they both liked being a &quot;regular kid&quot;, &quot;going to school&quot;, and &quot;work[ing] [their] own way&quot;. Pratt also related to the episodes, stating that they taught her how to &quot;deal with things that happened [in the episodes].&quot; Pratt recorded dialogue for the series on days when she was not rehearsing and taping for &quot;One on One.&quot; Soleil Moon Frye, best known as the title character on &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, was cast as Zoey Howzer. Describing the character as a &quot;wonderfully fun and cute and crazy little character&quot;, Frye told TVData Features Syndicate that she was &quot;having fun playing [her character]&quot;.

=== Writing ===
Featuring several conventions in every animated sitcom with socially relevant themes, Smith wanted to create &quot;something for the audience to laugh at&quot; and give them &quot;something to take away and be proud in terms of what [Black] culture represents.&quot; Although essentially an animated sitcom, Smith set up as an action-oriented show and included things that would be impossible for a live-action sitcom. Smith cited the first season episode &quot;I Had a Dream&quot; as one of the examples, stating that the premise is similar to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, and the premise would not be done in a &quot;live-action half hour&quot; show. According to TVData Features Syndicate, the dialogue included a &quot;hip-hop vocabulary primer&quot;, and the series blended classic family themes from shows like The Simpsons with coming-of-age elements reminiscent of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;.

=== Animation and design ===
In terms of design, Smith wanted the colors to &quot;create a harmony&quot; without &quot;ghetto hues&quot; for a mainstream look.

== Themes ==
Due to a few pitches of all cartoons featuring African-Americans, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; is one of the few animated kids shows that featured an African-American protagonist and one of the few animated sitcoms to feature African-Americans as lead characters. Dealing with themes of bullying, gossip, responsibility, and others, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; highlighted the importance of discrimination, stereotyping, and culture differences. With universal themes rooted in the African-American culture, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; was considered &quot;groundbreaking&quot; for television due to its depiction on an African-American family in their day-to-day lives. According to Michael Mallory of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, the series was also addressing the &quot;diversity issue&quot; more effectively than in primetime television at the time of publishing. Smith told Mike Duffy of &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; that the series is a &quot;celebration [and inclusion] of all cultures.&quot; Ben Hooper of TVData Features Syndicate commented that while several animated shows deal with &quot;multicultural issues&quot;, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; &quot;keeps it real&quot;–&quot;er, skews closer to reality&quot;–&quot;by presenting a multiracial cast of characters with which tweens in culturally diverse schools can identify.&quot; Gerald Raiti of &quot;Kidscreen&quot; recalled that although the series is a satire of family life, it was &quot;[communicating] to children of all races.&quot;

The series also had themes of African-American history and liberation. The first-season episode &quot;I Had a Dream&quot; experienced the importance of Black History Month and the life of a black person in the 1950s. In the episode, Penny encountered racism and segregation after she time-traveled to the year 1955. According to Smith on the holiday-themed episode &quot;Seven Days of Kwanzaa&quot;, he implied Kwanzaa as the &quot;true meaning of [December]&quot;, and he stated that &quot;Kwanzaa is about someone leading a purposeful life, [and] it ties in with what we feel the Christmas spirit is about: family, giving, unity, purpose.&quot;

==Broadcast==
In January 1999, Animation World Network announced that Nickelodeon commissioned production for &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. Although &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; implied that &quot;The Proud Family&quot; was picked up by Disney Channel on November 19, 2000, &quot;Variety&quot; officially announced that Disney Channel was preparing &quot;The Proud Family&quot; for its lineup on March 26, 2001. The series&#x27; debut episode, &quot;Bring It On&quot;, first aired on September 15, 2001, on Disney Channel. The show ran for two seasons and was followed by the 2005 film, &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot;, which ended the series.

===Reruns===
On August 31, 2002, &quot;The Proud Family&quot; began airing in reruns on ABC as part of Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning. Two weeks later, Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning would be rebranded as ABC Kids where &quot;The Proud Family&quot; continued airing until September 2, 2006, when it was removed from the lineup. The series was shown on Disney Channel as part of Disney Replay on October 1, 2015, and aired again on December 24, 2015, with the episode, &quot;Seven Days of Kwanzaa&quot;. In December 2018, the episode was part of a holiday live stream on Disney Channel&#x27;s YouTube channel. It also aired on Toon Disney until February 6, 2009, just six days before the channel was relaunched as Disney XD, BET in 2008 and Centric in 2010.

The second-season episode &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; was initially removed from reruns on the network in 2004 due to Oscar accusing Suga Mama&#x27;s new boyfriend Clarence of being a gigolo. The episode is currently available on Disney+. Another second-season episode &quot;Who You Calling a Sissy?&quot; was pulled after its initial airing on August 12, 2005, due to Michael Collins being called a sissy at the time. In 2022, it was confirmed that Michael Collins is gender non-conforming. The episode is also currently available on Disney+.

=== Critical response ===
The series received generally positive reviews from critics. Mark Sachs of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that it is a &quot;fresh-feeling animated show geared teens&quot;. Betsy Wallace of Common Sense Media said that the series is a mix of positive role models, zany comedy, and stories which are relatable, while questioning the political point of having a famous basketball player own everything in town. Nadira Goffe of &quot;Slate&quot; praised the series for its humor aimed at viewers, with clear inspirations for in-universe shows and references, and for starring a cast of Black teenagers of &quot;all different shades and family makeups.&quot; Todd Coleman of &quot;TelevisionWeek&quot; also praised the series for its &quot;flat-out hilarious&quot; humor, describing the series as &quot;hip in style&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised the series for having a &quot;perfect balance&quot; of being hilarious and heartfelt while breaking barriers with its &quot;BIPOC representation&quot; behind the scenes and in the show itself. &quot;Romper&quot; praised the series for positive representation of Black families, changing the narrative through each episode. &quot;HuffPost&quot; lauded the series for allowing Black people to see versions of themselves &quot;through expressive and entertaining characters. Leila Etthachfini of Vice Media criticized the show for negative stereotypes of Asian, Muslim, and Black people, but stated that it is &quot;a standout Disney show in many ways.&quot;

== Other media ==

On May 30, 2005, &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot; was announced as part of the &quot;tween-targeted fare&quot; on Disney Channel. The film premiered as a Disney Channel Original Movie on August 19, 2005, on Disney Channel. The film served as the series finale for show&#x27;s original run. All of the cast reprised their roles for the film. The film featured Omarion as 15 Cent and Arsenio Hall as Dr. Carver.

=== Video game ===
A video game based on the series was developed by Gorilla Systems and published by Buena Vista Games for the Game Boy Advance. The game was released in November 2005 in North America, a few months after the show ended. In the game, Penny works a variety of jobs to raise money so she can afford to buy her parents a T.H.A.N.G. (Total Home Automated Necessity Gizmo) for their upcoming wedding anniversary. Each job plays out as a minigame. Aside from Penny and her parents, other characters from the series also appear in the game, including Penny&#x27;s friends and Suga Mama. GameDaily and GameZone both rated the game 8 out of 10.

<doc id="146595" wikidata="Q151593" url="?curid=146595" title="Olivier Messiaen">
<text>Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (, ; ; 10 December 1908 – 27 April 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist. One of the major composers of the 20th century, he was also an outstanding teacher of composition and musical analysis.
Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at age 11 and studied with Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post he held for 61 years, until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. After the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was interned for nine months in the German prisoner of war camp Stalag VIII-A, where he composed his (&quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot;) for the four instruments available in the prison—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. Soon after his release in 1941, Messiaen was appointed professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1966, he was appointed professor of composition there, and he held both positions until retiring in 1978. His many distinguished pupils included Iannis Xenakis, George Benjamin, Alexander Goehr, Pierre Boulez, Jacques Hétu, Tristan Murail, Karlheinz Stockhausen, György Kurtág, and Yvonne Loriod, who became his second wife.
Messiaen perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as chromesthesia); according to him, combinations of these colours were important in his compositional process. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences, including Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah, and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. His style absorbed many global musical influences, such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). He found birdsong fascinating, notating bird songs worldwide and incorporating birdsong transcriptions into his music. 
Messiaen&#x27;s music is rhythmically complex. Harmonically and melodically, he employed a system he called &quot;modes of limited transposition&quot;, which he abstracted from the systems of material his early compositions and improvisations generated. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, voice, solo organ, and piano, and experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. For a short period he experimented with the parametrisation associated with &quot;total serialism&quot;, in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His innovative use of colour, his conception of the relationship between time and music, and his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen&#x27;s music distinctive.

==Biography==
===Youth and studies===
Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen was born on 10 December 1908 at 20 Boulevard Sixte-Isnard in Avignon, France, into a literary family. He was the elder of two sons of Cécile Anne Marie Antoinette Sauvage, a poet, and , a scholar and teacher of English from a farm near Wervicq-Sud who also translated William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays into French. Messiaen&#x27;s mother published a sequence of poems, (&quot;The Budding Soul&quot;), the last chapter of (&quot;As the Earth Turns&quot;), which address her unborn son. Messiaen later said this sequence of poems influenced him deeply and cited it as prophetic of his future artistic career. His brother , four years his junior, became a poet.

At the outbreak of World War I, Pierre enlisted and Cécile took their two boys to live with her brother in Grenoble. There Messiaen became fascinated with drama, reciting Shakespeare to his brother. Their homemade toy theatre had translucent backdrops made of cellophane wrappers. At this time he also adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the Dauphiné, where he had a house built south of Grenoble. He composed most of his music there.

Messiaen took piano lessons, having already taught himself to play. His interests included the recent music of French composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and he asked for opera vocal scores for Christmas presents. He also saved to buy scores, including Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, whose &quot;beautiful Norwegian melodic lines with the taste of folk song ... gave me a love of melody&quot;. Around this time he began to compose.

In 1918 his father returned from the war and the family moved to Nantes. Messiaen continued music lessons; one of his teachers, Jehan de Gibon, gave him a score of Debussy&#x27;s opera , which Messiaen called &quot;a thunderbolt&quot; and &quot;probably the most decisive influence on me&quot;. The next year, his father gained a teaching post at Sorbonne University in Paris. Olivier entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1919, aged 11.

Messiaen made excellent academic progress at the Conservatoire. In 1924, aged 15, he was awarded second prize in harmony, having been taught in that subject by professor Jean Gallon. In 1925, he won first prize in piano accompaniment, and in 1926 he gained first prize in fugue. After studying with Maurice Emmanuel, he was awarded second prize for the history of music in 1928. Emmanuel&#x27;s example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing improvisational skills on the piano, Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré. He won first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929. After a year studying composition with Charles-Marie Widor, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas. Messiaen&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis shortly before the class began. Despite his grief, he resumed his studies, and in 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition.

While a student he composed his first published works—his eight &quot;Préludes&quot; for piano (the earlier &quot;Le banquet céleste&quot; was published subsequently). These exhibit Messiaen&#x27;s use of his modes of limited transposition and palindromic rhythms (Messiaen called these &quot;non-retrogradable rhythms&quot;). His official début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite &quot;Les offrandes oubliées&quot;. That year he first heard a gamelan group, sparking his interest in the use of tuned percussion.

===La Trinité, &quot;La jeune France&quot;, and Messiaen&#x27;s war===
In the autumn of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré&#x27;s organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia in C minor&quot; to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité for the ailing Charles Quef. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen&#x27;s candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than 60 years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the &quot;Apparition de l&#x27;église éternelle&quot; for organ.

He also married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos (daughter of Victor Delbos) that year. Their marriage inspired him both to compose works for her to play (&quot;Thème et variations&quot; for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle &quot;Poèmes pour Mi&quot; in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. &quot;Mi&quot; was Messiaen&#x27;s affectionate nickname for his wife. On 14 July 1937, the Messiaens&#x27; son, Pascal Emmanuel, was born; Messiaen celebrated the occasion by writing Chants de Terre et de Ciel. The marriage turned tragic when Delbos lost her memory after an operation toward the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.

In 1934, Messiaen released his first major work for organ, La Nativité du Seigneur. He wrote a followup four years later, Les Corps glorieux; it premièred in 1945.

In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group &quot;La jeune France&quot; (&quot;Young France&quot;). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1918 &quot;Le coq et l&#x27;arlequin&quot; in favour of a &quot;living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness&quot;. Messiaen&#x27;s career soon departed from this polemical phase.

In response to a commission for a piece to accompany light-and-water shows on the Seine during the &quot;Paris Exposition&quot;, in 1937 Messiaen demonstrated his interest in using the ondes Martenot, an electronic instrument, by composing &quot;Fêtes des belles eaux&quot; for an ensemble of six. He included a part for the instrument in several of his subsequent compositions.
During this period he composed several multi-movement organ works. He arranged his orchestral suite &quot;L&#x27;Ascension&quot; for organ, replacing the orchestral version&#x27;s third movement with an entirely new movement, &quot;Transports de joie d&#x27;une âme devant la gloire du Christ qui est la sienne&quot; (&quot;Ecstasies of a soul before the glory of Christ which is the soul&#x27;s own&quot;) (). He also wrote the extensive cycles &quot;La Nativité du Seigneur&quot; (&quot;The Nativity of the Lord&quot;) and &quot;Les Corps glorieux&quot; (&quot;The glorious bodies&quot;).

At the outbreak of World War II, Messiaen was drafted into the French army. Due to poor eyesight, he was enlisted as a medical auxiliary rather than an active combatant. He was captured at Verdun, where he befriended clarinettist Henri Akoka; they were taken to Görlitz in May 1940, and imprisoned at Stalag VIII-A. He met a cellist (Étienne Pasquier) and a violinist () among his fellow prisoners. He wrote a trio for them, which he gradually incorporated into a more expansive new work, &quot;Quatuor pour la fin du Temps&quot; (&quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot;). With the help of a friendly German guard, , he acquired manuscript paper and pencils. The work was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards, with the composer playing a poorly maintained upright piano in freezing conditions and the trio playing third-hand unkempt instruments. The enforced introspection and reflection of camp life bore fruit in one of 20th-century classical music&#x27;s acknowledged masterpieces. The title&#x27;s &quot;end of time&quot; alludes to the Apocalypse, and also to the way that Messiaen, through rhythm and harmony, used time in a manner completely different from his predecessors and contemporaries.

The idea of a European Centre of Education and Culture &quot;Meeting Point Music Messiaen&quot; on the site of Stalag VIII-A, for children and youth, artists, musicians and everyone in the region emerged in December 2004, was developed with the involvement of Messiaen&#x27;s widow as a joint project between the council districts in Germany and Poland, and was completed in 2014.

===&quot;Tristan&quot; and serialism===

Shortly after his release from Görlitz in May 1941 in large part due to the persuasions of his friend and teacher Marcel Dupré, Messiaen, who was now a household name, was appointed a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire, where he taught until retiring in 1978. He compiled his &quot;Technique de mon langage musical&quot; (&quot;Technique of my musical language&quot;) published in 1944, in which he quotes many examples from his music, particularly the Quartet. Although only in his mid-thirties, his students described him as an outstanding teacher. Among his early students were the composers Pierre Boulez and Karel Goeyvaerts. Other pupils included Karlheinz Stockhausen in 1952, Alexander Goehr in 1956–57, Jacques Hétu in 1962-63, Tristan Murail in 1967–72 and George Benjamin during the late 1970s. The Greek composer Iannis Xenakis was referred to him in 1951; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music.

In 1943, Messiaen wrote &quot;Visions de l&#x27;Amen&quot; (&quot;Visions of the Amen&quot;) for two pianos for Yvonne Loriod and himself to perform. Shortly thereafter he composed the enormous solo piano cycle &quot;Vingt regards sur l&#x27;enfant-Jésus&quot; (&quot;Twenty gazes upon the child Jesus&quot;) for her. Again for Loriod, he wrote &quot;Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine&quot; (&quot;Three small liturgies of the Divine Presence&quot;) for female chorus and orchestra, which includes a difficult solo piano part.

Two years after &quot;Visions de l&#x27;Amen&quot;, Messiaen composed the song cycle &quot;Harawi&quot;, the first of three works inspired by the legend of Tristan and Isolde. The second of these works about human (as opposed to divine) love was the result of a commission from Serge Koussevitzky. Messiaen said the commission did not specify the length of the work or the size of the orchestra. This was the ten-movement &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot;. It is not a conventional symphony, but rather an extended meditation on the joy of human union and love. It does not contain the sexual guilt inherent in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; because Messiaen believed sexual love to be a divine gift. The third piece inspired by the &quot;Tristan&quot; myth was &quot;Cinq rechants&quot; for 12 unaccompanied singers, described by Messiaen as influenced by the alba of the troubadours. Messiaen visited the United States in 1949, where his music was conducted by Koussevitsky and Leopold Stokowski. His &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; was first performed in the US the same year, conducted by Leonard Bernstein.

Messiaen taught an analysis class at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1947 he taught (and performed with Loriod) for two weeks in Budapest. In 1949 he taught at Tanglewood and presented his work at the Darmstadt new music summer school. While he did not employ the twelve-tone technique, after three years teaching analysis of twelve-tone scores, including works by Arnold Schoenberg, he experimented with ways of making scales of other elements (including duration, articulation and dynamics) analogous to the chromatic pitch scale. The results of these innovations was the &quot;Mode de valeurs et d&#x27;intensités&quot; for piano (from the &quot;Quatre études de rythme&quot;) which has been misleadingly described as the first work of &quot;total serialism&quot;. It had a large influence on the earliest European serial composers, including Boulez and Stockhausen. During this period he also experimented with musique concrète, music for recorded sounds.

===Birdsong and the 1960s===
When in 1952 Messiaen was asked to provide a test piece for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he composed the piece for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example , and ), the flute piece was based entirely on the song of the blackbird.

He took this development to a new level with his 1953 orchestral work —its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onward, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of 13 piano pieces completed in 1958, and of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.
Messiaen&#x27;s first wife died in 1959 after a long illness, and in 1961 he married Loriod. He began to travel widely, to attend musical events and to seek out and transcribe the songs of more exotic birds in the wild. Despite this, he spoke only French. Loriod frequently assisted her husband&#x27;s detailed studies of birdsong while walking with him, by making tape recordings for later reference. In 1962 he visited Japan, where Gagaku music and Noh theatre inspired the orchestral &quot;Japanese sketches&quot;, , which contain stylised imitations of traditional Japanese instruments.

Messiaen&#x27;s music was by this time championed by, among others, Boulez, who programmed first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival. Works performed included , (commissioned for the 1960 festival), and . The latter piece was the result of a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, , was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.

His reputation as a composer continued to grow and in 1959, he was nominated as an of the . In 1966, he was officially appointed professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, although he had in effect been teaching composition for years. Further honours included election to the Institut de France in 1967 and the Académie des Beaux-arts in 1968, the Erasmus Prize in 1971, the award of the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1975, the Sonning Award (Denmark&#x27;s highest musical honour) in 1977, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1982, and the presentation of the of the Belgian Order of the Crown in 1980.

===&quot;Transfiguration&quot;, &quot;Canyons&quot;, &quot;St. Francis&quot;, and &quot;the Beyond&quot;===
Messiaen&#x27;s next work was the large-scale &quot;La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ&quot;. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ&#x27;s Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the U.S. in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon&#x27;s distinctive colours and birdsong. The 12-movement orchestral piece &quot;Des canyons aux étoiles...&quot; was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.
In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. Reluctant to take on such a major project, he was persuaded by French president Georges Pompidou to accept the commission and began work on &quot;Saint-François d&#x27;Assise&quot; in 1975 after two years of preparation. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a &quot;spectacle&quot; rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984, he published a major collection of organ pieces, &quot;Livre du Saint Sacrement&quot;; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.

In the summer of 1978, Messiaen was forced to retire from teaching at the Paris Conservatoire due to French law. He was promoted to the highest rank of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, the &quot;Grand-Croix&quot;, in 1987, and was awarded the decoration in London by his old friend Jean Langlais. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen&#x27;s 80th included a complete performance in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall of &quot;St. François&quot;, which the composer attended, and Erato&#x27;s publication of a 17-CD collection of his music, including a disc of Messiaen in conversation with Claude Samuel.

Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back), he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, &quot;Éclairs sur l&#x27;au-delà...&quot;, which premièred six months after his death. He died in the Beaujon Hospital in Clichy on 27 April 1992, aged 83.

On going through his papers, Loriod discovered that, in the last months of his life, he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to: herself, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin (hence the title &quot;Concert à quatre&quot;). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.

==Music==
Messiaen&#x27;s music has been described as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.

&quot;[Messiaen&#x27;s youthful] fascination with Shakespeare&#x27;s depiction of human passion and with his magical world also influenced the composer&#x27;s later works.&quot; Messiaen was not interested in depicting aspects of theology such as sin; rather he concentrated on the theology of joy, divine love and redemption.

Messiaen continually evolved new composition techniques, always integrating them into his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every &quot;major&quot; work from the &quot;Quatuor&quot; onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. But very few of these works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in &quot;Meditations&quot;, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for &quot;Des canyons aux etoiles...&quot;, and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of &quot;St. François d&#x27;Assise&quot;.

As well as discovering new techniques, Messiaen studied and absorbed foreign music, including Ancient Greek rhythms, Hindu rhythms (he encountered Śārṅgadeva&#x27;s list of 120 rhythmic units, the deçî-tâlas), Balinese and Javanese Gamelan, birdsong, and Japanese music (see &quot;Example 1&quot; for an instance of his use of ancient Greek and Hindu rhythms).

While he was instrumental in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two treatises; the second, in five volumes, was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques a means to intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional ends. Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria: it must be interesting, beautiful to listen to, and touch the listener.

Messiaen wrote a large body of music for the piano. Although a considerable pianist himself, he was undoubtedly assisted by Loriod&#x27;s formidable technique and ability to convey complex rhythms and rhythmic combinations; in his piano writing from &quot;Visions de l&#x27;Amen&quot; onward he had her in mind. Messiaen said, &quot;I am able to allow myself the greatest eccentricities because to her anything is possible.&quot;

===Western influences===
Developments in modern French music were a major influence on Messiaen, particularly the music of Debussy and his use of the whole-tone scale (which Messiaen called &quot;Mode 1&quot; in his modes of limited transposition). Messiaen rarely used the whole-tone scale in his compositions because, he said, after Debussy and Dukas there was &quot;nothing to add&quot;, but the modes he did use are similarly symmetrical.

Messiaen had a great admiration for the music of Igor Stravinsky, particularly the use of rhythm in earlier works such as &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, and his use of orchestral colour. He was further influenced by the orchestral brilliance of Heitor Villa-Lobos, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and gave acclaimed concerts there. Among composers for the keyboard, Messiaen singled out Jean-Philippe Rameau, Domenico Scarlatti, Frédéric Chopin, Debussy, and Isaac Albéniz. He loved the music of Modest Mussorgsky and incorporated varied modifications of what he called the &quot;M-shaped&quot; melodic motif from Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, although he modified the final interval from a perfect fourth to a tritone (&quot;Example 3&quot;).

Messiaen was further influenced by Surrealism, as seen in the titles of some of the piano &quot;Préludes&quot; (&quot;Un reflet dans le vent...&quot;, &quot;A reflection in the wind&quot;) and in some of the imagery of his poetry (he published poems as prefaces to certain works, for example &quot;Les offrandes oubliées&quot;).

===Colour===
Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen&#x27;s music. He believed that terms such as &quot;tonal&quot;, &quot;modal&quot; and &quot;serial&quot; are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.

In some of Messiaen&#x27;s scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in &quot;Couleurs de la cité céleste&quot; and &quot;Des canyons aux étoiles...&quot;)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen&#x27;s synaesthesia, which caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (his form of synaesthesia, the most common form, involved experiencing the associated colours in a non-visual form rather than perceiving them visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise &quot;Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d&#x27;ornithologie&quot; (&quot;Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong&quot;), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (&quot;gold and brown&quot;) to the highly detailed (&quot;blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant&quot;).

When asked what Messiaen&#x27;s main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, &quot;I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself.&quot;

===Symmetry===
Many of Messiaen&#x27;s composition techniques made use of symmetries of time and pitch.

====Time====

From his earliest works, Messiaen used non-retrogradable (palindromic) rhythms (&quot;Example 2&quot;). He sometimes combined rhythms with harmonic sequences in such a way that, if the process were repeated indefinitely, the music would eventually run through all possible permutations and return to its starting point. For Messiaen, this represented the &quot;charm of impossibilities&quot; of these processes. He only ever presented a portion of any such process, as if allowing the informed listener a glimpse of something eternal. In the first movement of &quot;Quatuor pour la fin du temps&quot; the piano and cello together provide an early example.

====Pitch====
Messiaen used modes he called &quot;modes of limited transposition&quot;. They are distinguished as groups of notes that can only be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen&#x27;s Mode 1) exists in only two transpositions: C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen&#x27;s Mode 2 (identical to the &quot;octatonic scale&quot; used by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.

===Time and rhythm===

As well as making use of non-retrogradable rhythms and the Hindu decî-tâlas, Messiaen also composed with &quot;additive&quot; rhythms. This involves lengthening individual notes slightly or interpolating a short note into an otherwise regular rhythm (see &quot;Example 3&quot;), or shortening or lengthening every note of a rhythm by the same duration (adding a semiquaver to every note in a rhythm on its repeat, for example). This led Messiaen to use rhythmic cells that irregularly alternate between two and three units, a process that also occurs in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, which Messiaen admired.

A factor that contributes to Messiaen&#x27;s suspension of the conventional perception of time in his music is the extremely slow tempos he often specifies (the fifth movement &quot;Louange à l&#x27;eternité de Jésus&quot; of &quot;Quatuor&quot; is actually given the tempo marking &quot;infiniment lent&quot;). Messiaen also used the concept of &quot;chromatic durations&quot;, for example in his &quot;Soixante-quatre durées&quot; from &quot;Livre d&#x27;orgue&quot; (), which is built from, in Messiaen&#x27;s words, &quot;64 chromatic durations from 1 to 64 demisemiquavers [thirty-second notes]—invested in groups of 4, from the ends to the centre, forwards and backwards alternately—treated as a retrograde canon. The whole peopled with birdsong.&quot;

===Harmony===

In addition to making harmonic use of the modes of limited transposition, Messiaen cited the harmonic series as a physical phenomenon that gives chords a context he felt was missing in purely serial music. An example of Messiaen&#x27;s use of this phenomenon, which he called &quot;resonance&quot;, is the last two bars of his first piano &quot;Prélude&quot;, &quot;La colombe&quot; (&quot;The dove&quot;): the chord is built from harmonics of the fundamental note E.

Messiaen also composed music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is the song of the golden oriole in &quot;Le loriot&quot; of the &quot;Catalogue d&#x27;oiseaux&quot; for solo piano (&quot;Example 4&quot;).

In his use of conventional diatonic chords, Messiaen often transcended their historical connotations (for example, with his frequent use of the added sixth chord as a resolution).

===Birdsong===

Birdsong fascinated Messiaen from an early age, and in this he found encouragement from Dukas, who reportedly urged his pupils to &quot;listen to the birds&quot;. Messiaen included stylised birdsong in some of his early compositions (including &quot;L&#x27;abîme d&#x27;oiseaux&quot; from the &quot;Quatuor pour la fin du temps&quot;), integrating it into his sound-world by techniques like the modes of limited transposition and chord colouration. His evocations of birdsong became increasingly sophisticated, and with &quot;Le réveil des oiseaux&quot; this process reached maturity, the whole piece being built from birdsong: in effect it is a dawn chorus for orchestra. The same can be said for &quot;Epode&quot;, the five-minute sixth movement of &quot;Chronochromie&quot;, which is scored for 18 violins, each playing a different birdsong. Messiaen notated the bird species with the music in the score (examples 1 and 4). The pieces are not simple transcriptions; even the works with purely bird-inspired titles, such as &quot;Catalogue d&#x27;oiseaux&quot; and &quot;Fauvette des jardins&quot;, are tone poems evoking the landscape, its colours and atmosphere.

===Serialism===
For a few compositions, Messiaen created scales for duration, attack and timbre analogous to the chromatic pitch scale. He expressed annoyance at the historical importance given to one of these works, &quot;Mode de valeurs et d&#x27;intensités&quot;, by musicologists intent on crediting him with the invention of &quot;total serialism&quot;.

Messiaen later introduced what he called a &quot;communicable language&quot;, a &quot;musical alphabet&quot; to encode sentences. He first used this technique in his &quot;Méditations sur le Mystère de la Sainte Trinité&quot; for organ; where the &quot;alphabet&quot; includes motifs for the concepts &quot;to have&quot;, &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;God&quot;, while the sentences encoded feature sections from the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas.

<text>Michel Gérard Joseph Colucci (, ; 28 October 1944 – 19 June 1986), better known under his stage name Coluche (), was a French stage comedian, cinema actor, activist and philanthropist. He adopted &quot;Coluche&quot; as a stage name at age 26, when he began his entertainment career. He became known for his irreverent attitude towards politics and the establishment, and he incorporated this into much of his material. He was one of the first major comedians to regularly use profanities as a source of humor on French television. He also founded the charity &quot;Les Restaurants du Cœur&quot; which still provides free meals and other products to people in need.

==Early life==
Colucci was born on 28 October 1944, just weeks after the Liberation of Paris, in a hospital in the 14th arrondissement of the city. His mother, Simone Bouyer (called &quot;Monette&quot;), worked as a florist in the Boulevard du Montparnasse. His father, Honorio Colucci, from Casalvieri in Lazio, Italy, was a painter and decorator. His father died in 1947 at age 31 from poliomyelitis; his wife struggled thereafter to raise the young Michel and his sister (Danièle, 18 months older than Michel) on a meagre salary.

Coluche showed little promise at school, and left after completing his primary studies (June 1958). He tried various temporary jobs, and had several run-ins with authorities. During this time his mother bought him a guitar, which he taught himself to play. In 1964 he joined the 60th Infantry Regiment de Lons-le-Saunier, but was imprisoned for insubordination. On his return to civilian life, he worked in his mother&#x27;s florist shop which she had been able to open on rue d&#x27;Aligre, and later in a larger shop which she opened near la Gare de Lyon. He found this work dull, and suddenly quit, which caused a long-lasting breach with his mother.

At the end of the 1960s he tried his luck as a singer in cafes, then turned to comedy.

==Success==
In 1969, with Romain Bouteille he was present at the start of the Café de la Gare, meeting place of a group of young comedic actors practically all of whom were to become famous: Patrick Dewaere, Henri Guybet, Miou-Miou, Martin Lamotte, etc. Among the patrons of the Café de la Gare were Georges Moustaki, Raymond Devos, Jean Ferrat, Jacques Brel, Leni Escudero, Pierre Perret and Jean Yanne. Later they were joined by Gérard Lanvin, Renaud, Rufus, Diane Kurys, Coline Serreau, Anémone, Gérard Depardieu, Thierry Lhermitte, Josiane Balasko and Gérard Jugnot.

Coluche&#x27;s first sketch &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;histoire d&#x27;un mec&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s the story of a guy&quot;) was about the difficulties of telling a funny story. He quickly found success, but alcohol problems forced him to leave the group.

He went on to found another group, &quot;Le vrai chic parisien&quot; (The true Parisian chic) and it was then that he met his future wife, Véronique Kantor. They married in 1975 and had two sons, Marius and Romain Colucci. His behaviour and addictions forced him to leave the new group and launch his solo career.

==Solo career==
It was at this point that he began to dress in his well-known outfit of white tennis shoes, blue striped overalls, a bright yellow T-shirt and round glasses. He became famous with his parody of a TV game (Le Schmilblick). He was sacked by the radio stations Europe 1 and Radio Monte Carlo for vulgarity.

== 1980s ==

=== Presidential bid ===

In a 30 October 1980 press conference at the theatre of his one-man show, Coluche announced his candidacy for the French presidential election. He was not taken seriously until the Sunday newspaper &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot; published a poll on 14 December 1980 showing Coluche supported by 16% of potential voters. His &quot;campaign&quot; was supported and organized by Parisian publisher Charlie Hebdo, with slogans such as &quot;Before me, France was divided in two; now it will be folded in four&quot; (more idiomatically &quot;être plié en quatre&quot; could be translated as &quot;doubled over laughing&quot;), and &quot;Coluche - the only candidate who has no reason to lie&quot;. However, he withdrew after pressure from serious politicians - including François Mitterrand who saw him as a menace for his own candidacy - and the murder of his manager René Gorlin.

=== César ===

In 1984 Coluche was awarded the César Award for Best Actor for his role in the film &quot;Tchao Pantin&quot; (1983) directed by Claude Berri, a film that mirrored his chaotic personal life.

=== Restaurants du Cœur ===

In September 1985, he launched the &quot;Restaurants du Cœur&quot; (usually called Restos du cœur) charity (40,000 volunteers in almost 2,500 eating establishments, which serve some 600,000 daily beneficiaries) in a speech on the radio station Europe 1. The charity collects food, money and clothes for the needy and the homeless. Each year, a fundraising concert series is presented by singers and celebrities collectively known as &quot;Les Enfoirés&quot;.

=== Death ===

In March 1985 Coluche had set a world speed record (252.087 km/h; 156.64 mph) on a one-km (1000 yard) track in Italy with a 750cc motorcycle.
A little more than a year later, at 16:35 on 19 June 1986, he died after crashing his Honda 1100 VFC into a truck on the &quot;route de Cannes&quot;, a road in the commune of Opio, Alpes-Maritimes in southeastern France. He was 41. This event provoked national grief and inspired the album &quot;Putain de camion&quot; (&quot;fucking truck&quot;) by his close friend Renaud. Some conspiracy theories have since surfaced, mainly in the book &quot;Coluche, l&#x27;accident: contre-enquête&quot;, alleging that Coluche might have been murdered.

On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his death, from 6 October 2016 to 14 January 2017, an exhibition about Coluche was held at Paris City Hall.

In March 2011, a bronze statue of Coluche, dressed in his trademark striped dungarees, was unveiled in his hometown of Montrouge (suburb of Paris).

==Awards==

Coluche won the César Award for &quot;Best Actor&quot; for his role in &quot;Tchao Pantin&quot; (&quot;So Long, Stooge&quot;, 1983), one of his few dramatic roles.

==Film==
The film &quot;Coluche : l&#x27;histoire d&#x27;un mec&quot;, directed by Antoine de Caunes and relating the events surrounding Coluche&#x27;s bid for the French presidency in 1981 was released in France in October 2008. François-Xavier Demaison plays Coluche.

==Legacy==
Coming from a working-class family and a background of grinding poverty, Coluche fought for the equality of citizens. A law known as the &quot;Loi Coluche&quot; was passed in 1988, allowing large tax deductions (up to 75% in some cases) for individuals or businesses that donate to specified aid agencies.

The main-belt asteroid 170906 Coluche, discovered by Swiss astronomer Michel Ory in 2004, was named after Coluche.

There are statues of Coluche in his home quarter of Montrouge (suburb of Paris), unveiled in March 2011 (a bronze statue of Coluche, dressed with his trademark striped dungaree), and in Le Vigan, Gard in the south of France. Numerous theatres, schools and social spaces bear his name all over France.

In October 2016, the Hôtel de ville de Paris (5, rue de Lobau) opened an exhibition marking the 30th anniversary of his death. It focuses on his radio and movie career up to his announcement of his presidential candidacy. It ran through 7 January 2017.

<text>The Tricorn Centre was a shopping, nightclub and car park complex in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. It was designed in the Brutalist style by Owen Luder and Rodney Gordon and took its name from the site&#x27;s shape which from the air resembled a tricorn hat. Constructed in the mid-1960s, it was demolished in 2004. It was home to one of the first Virgin Megastores and housed the largest Laser Quest arena in Europe.

The centre was a well-known example of 1960s architecture, and in the 1980s it was voted the 3rd ugliest building in the UK. In 2001, BBC Radio 4 listeners voted it the most hated building in the UK, and Charles, Prince of Wales described it as &quot;a mildewed lump of elephant droppings&quot;. Demolition of the Tricorn began on 24 March 2004 and took approximately nine months. , the site is a ground level car park for the city centre.

==Construction and opening==

Opened in 1966, the centre was an attempt to revitalise Portsmouth, costing the city council £2 million. Originally called &#x27;the Casbah&#x27; by its creators, it was deliberately designed with vast amounts of blank surfaces with the expectation that tenants would provide the colour and character via their signage and store frontages. It was hoped that premium stores would occupy the centre but as the centre was not connected to Portsmouth Town Centre, these stores never moved in. Instead the units were let to smaller stores. As well as small traders, tenants included a supermarket and two pubs. In 1967 the site received a commendation from the Civic Trust.

==Businesses in the Tricorn==
With the failure of a large store to move in, most of the shops were small traders of various types, including market traders with a range of stalls. There was also a Fine Fare supermarket. The council succeeded in getting the fruit and veg market to move from Commercial Road but there were soon complaints. Conditions were found to be dark, damp and poorly ventilated. Access was also a problem with lorries finding it difficult to get to the market via the spiral ramps.

===Pubs===
Two pubs – The Casbah and The Golden Bell – were located inside the Tricorn Centre. They were officially opened on 31 August 1966. There was also a club for live music – originally named the Tricorn Club, later renamed Granny&#x27;s and subsequently Basins – which hosted live performances by Marc Bolan, Slade, Mud, The Sweet, Status Quo, Mary Wells, Edwin Starr, 10,000 Maniacs, and Vinegar Joe, as well as local acts.

===Flats===
The centre included eight flats. While initially popular with some residents, the flats suffered from poorly constructed roofs and leaking walls. Only one tenant was left by March 1979 and the flats were later boarded up.

==Demolition==
During the 1980s, the centre became increasingly seedy and the nightclub was developed into a casino. The shops slowly left, with the last ones quietly departing in March 2002. The centre&#x27;s car park was also the scene of many suicide attempts, being amongst the tallest publicly accessible buildings on the south coast. For this reason, a plaque offering support from The Samaritans was positioned at this infamous point.

Numerous attempts to get the building listed as amongst the best examples of Brutalist architecture failed throughout the 1990s, and neglect, in addition to Portsmouth&#x27;s wet coastal climate, caused the building to fall beyond the scope of easy repair. Structural steel within the concrete began to rust causing expansion of the concrete, and in some sections, small stalactites began to grow off ledges. Portsmouth City Council deliberated the demolition of the centre for many years; however, the uniquely designed car-parking block, which provided 400 parking spaces, was too useful for the city to destroy until 2004. The site is now occupied by a ground-level open-air car park.

Opponents of demolition argued that the structure, while sadly undermaintained, was still salvageable with the work of ingenious designers and a long-term city plan. Essayist Jonathan Meades commented: &quot;You don&#x27;t go knocking down Stonehenge or Lincoln Cathedral. I think buildings like the Tricorn were as good as that. They were great monuments of an age.&quot; However, government and public opinion was that the building had decayed too far and had attracted such a bad reputation that the only option was to replace it.

The Tricorn was the subject of such strength and diversity of public feeling that opinion boards were placed around its boarding for the public to write on.
